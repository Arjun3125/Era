      "text": "**Response:**  \n\n1. **What low-risk, value-aligned experiments could I test?**  \n   I could dedicate a few hours each week to learning coding through online courses, explore freelancing part-time to test new career directions, and volunteer for projects at work that align with my interests.  \n\n2. **How might I create a transition roadmap?**  \n   I’d aim to save a portion of my income to build a financial safety net, use work resources to upskill in high-demand areas like coding, and gradually expand my professional network through informational interviews and online communities.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how to balance these experiments with my full-time job without feeling overwhelmed. I’ll also need guidance on how to measure progress and adjust my plan as needed.  \n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI’m excited about the idea of testing low-risk experiments and building a transition roadmap. It feels structured and manageable, but I’d appreciate more advice on prioritization and progress tracking to ensure I stay on track without burning out.",
