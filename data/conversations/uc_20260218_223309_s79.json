This step helps you build a **mental model** for choosing where to invest energy, turning overwhelm into clarity.  \n- **Focusing on outcomes, not tasks.** Sustainable progress requires **defining what success looks like** for your top priority. This shifts the focus from “what to do” to “why it matters,” aligning actions with purpose.  \n\n---\n\n**Next Step:**  \nIf you’re ready, share your answers to these questions. From there, we can:  \n- Create a **custom prioritization framework** to filter competing goals,  \n- Design a **30-day focus experiment** to test progress toward one key outcome,  \n- Identify **non-essential commitments** that drain your energy and prevent alignment.  \n\nIf you’re unsure, I’ll guide you through a simple exercise to map out your goals and their potential impact.  \n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed.",

      "text": "**1. How do you currently decide which goals or commitments to prioritize when they seem equally important or urgent?**  \nI often rely on a gut feeling or a sense of urgency, but I rarely take the time to assess the long-term impact of each task. I end up juggling multiple things without a clear framework, which leads to scattered efforts and frustration. For example, I might prioritize a task that feels immediate but doesn’t align with my core values or long-term goals.\n\n**2. What would be the most meaningful outcome if you could fully commit to one goal for the next 30 days, without distraction or compromise?**  \nIf I could focus exclusively on one priority, like building a sustainable career path aligned with my values, the outcome would be feeling a sense of progress and alignment with my long-term vision. This would allow me to reduce the mental load of juggling multiple competing demands and create momentum toward something meaningful.\n\n**Reflection on the guidance:**  \nI appreciate how this approach shifts the focus from feeling overwhelmed to taking intentional action. I’m ready to try building a prioritization framework, but I’d like some help tailoring it to my specific situation.",
