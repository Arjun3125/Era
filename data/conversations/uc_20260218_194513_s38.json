      "text": "**Response:**  \n\n1. **What low-risk, value-aligned experiments could I test?**  \n   I could dedicate 5–6 hours per week to learning coding through free platforms like freeCodeCamp or Codecademy, build a portfolio of small projects, and offer them for free or low pay to gain experience. I’d also reach out to professionals in my target fields (like UX/UI or data analysis) for informational interviews to understand their career paths and get advice. This way, I can explore new opportunities without quitting my job or spending money.\n\n2. **How could I create a transition roadmap?**  \n   I’d aim to save at least 20% of my income monthly as a safety net. I’d also enroll in affordable online courses (like Coursera or Udemy) to upskill in high-demand areas. Networking through informational interviews and LinkedIn groups would help me build connections and stay updated on job opportunities. Over time, I’d gradually shift my focus toward these new fields while maintaining my current job for financial stability.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties:**  \nI’m concerned about how much time these experiments will take and whether I’ll be able to measure progress. I’d also like to know how to prioritize skills or fields to invest my time effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nThis advice feels very practical and tailored to my situation. I appreciate the emphasis on low-risk experiments and phased transitions, which aligns with my need to maintain financial stability while exploring new opportunities. I feel more confident about taking the next steps now.",
