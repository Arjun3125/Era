      "text": "**1. What is one low-risk, incremental step you could take within your current role?**  \nI could dedicate one hour each week to learning a new skill, such as taking a free online course on Coursera or exploring a topic I'm passionate about (e.g., digital marketing or project management). This would allow me to explore my interests without affecting my current job or financial stability.  \n\n**2. What is one specific milestone would you set to track progress?**  \nI would set a milestone of completing one online course by the end of the year. To track progress, I’d use a simple journal or app to log my daily study time and track my completion rate. This would help me stay motivated and measure my progress toward my long-term goals.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how much time this might realistically take, especially with a full-time job. I’m also unsure if completing one course will feel like enough progress compared to my long-term goals, but I’m committed to starting small and building momentum.  \n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI think this guidance is really helpful because it breaks down the problem into manageable steps. Having a clear milestone and a way to track progress makes the process feel less overwhelming and more achievable. I appreciate the focus on low-risk actions that still allow for meaningful growth.",
