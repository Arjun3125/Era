      "text": "**Response:**  \nI'm struggling with the conflict between maintaining financial stability in my current role and pursuing a career path that aligns with my long-term values and purpose. I feel increasingly disconnected from my daily work, which lacks the meaning and fulfillment I seek. I'm concerned about the risks of leaving my job entirely, but I'm also worried about staying in a role that doesn't align with my values long-term. I'm looking for guidance on how to bridge this gap—whether through incremental changes in my current role or exploring hybrid models that allow me to test a new path while maintaining financial security.",
