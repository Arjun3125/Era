      "text": "**Response:**  \n\nI’m worried about financial shortfalls and job security if I pursue a career aligned with my values, especially since my current role doesn’t offer much flexibility for gradual transitions. I’ve considered testing my new path through freelance work or part-time roles, but I’m unsure if I can sustain it without a steady income.  \n\nTo address my disconnection and build momentum, I’ve started dedicating one hour each weekend to a passion project related to my desired career. It’s small, but it helps me feel more connected to my values and reduces the uncertainty. I’m still concerned about how to balance this with the risks of transitioning, but I’m hopeful that these small steps can lead to bigger changes over time.  \n\n**Reaction to Guidance:**  \nI appreciate how you’ve emphasized mitigating risks through low-stakes experiments and integrating value-aligned actions into daily life. This advice feels practical and reassuring, and it’s helping me feel more confident about taking small steps toward my goals.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nI’d love to discuss how to further balance financial risks with value-driven actions while maintaining mental and emotional well-being.",
