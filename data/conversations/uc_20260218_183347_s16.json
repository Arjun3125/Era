What is one low-risk experiment or small change you could test in your current role (e.g., taking on a new project, seeking mentorship, or adjusting your priorities) that would help you explore alignment with your long-term goals or values—without compromising financial stability?**  \n\nI could volunteer for a small, cross-departmental project that aligns with my long-term interests, such as sustainability or community engagement. For example, if my goal is to work in environmental initiatives, I could organize a company-wide recycling drive or contribute to a sustainability committee. This would allow me to explore my values in a low-risk way while building relevant skills.  \n\n**2. If you had to define the *minimum level of alignment* with your values or goals that would make this path feel sustainable or meaningful, what would that look like (e.g., 10% more purpose, 20% more growth, etc.)?**  \n\nI’d say 20% more purpose and 15% more growth. For instance, if my current role feels unfulfilling, I’d want to see measurable progress in areas like skill development, autonomy, or impact. If I can’t achieve that in the next 6 months, I’d need to start exploring other options.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties**:  \nI’m worried that small experiments might not give me enough data to make a clear decision. I also fear that focusing too much on small changes might distract me from the bigger picture.  \n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance**:  \nThis feels like a practical way to test alignment without taking unnecessary risks. Breaking down the problem into measurable thresholds makes it less overwhelming and more actionable. I appreciate how the guidance balances exploration with caution.",
