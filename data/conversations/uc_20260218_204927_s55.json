How might you balance these risks by creating a *transition plan* that allows for gradual movement toward your values while maintaining a safety net (e.g., saving, side income, skill development)?**  \n   - *Example:* Could you allocate 10% of your income to a savings fund for a potential career shift, while dedicating 5 hours/week to learning skills or networking in your target field?  \n\n2. **How can you begin *reducing the emotional disconnection* you feel in your current role by integrating small, value-aligned actions (e.g., volunteering, mentoring, or creative projects) that align with your purpose, even if they’re not central to your job?**  \n   - *Example:* If your values include helping others, could you volunteer 2 hours/month or collaborate with a colleague on a project that aligns with your purpose, even if it’s outside your core responsibilities?  \n\n---  \n**Why these questions matter (risk domain):**  \n- The first question helps you **quantify and balance risks** by creating a structured transition plan, ensuring you’re not making a leap of faith but instead building a bridge between stability and your goals.  \n- The second question addresses the **emotional toll of disconnection**, offering tangible ways to align your daily actions with your values, even in small ways, which can reduce uncertainty and build momentum.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nWhat is one *specific action* you could take in the next 30 days to either:  \n- Mitigate a risk you’re worried about (e.g., saving money, learning a skill), or  \n- Integrate a value-aligned activity into your current role (e.g., volunteering, creative work) to reduce disconnection?",
