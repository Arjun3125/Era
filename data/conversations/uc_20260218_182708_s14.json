      "text": "**1. What specific aspects of your current job feel most misaligned with your long-term goals or values, and how might you begin addressing those gaps in small, sustainable ways (e.g., skill development, networking, or role adjustments)?**  \n\nTasks like endless meetings and repetitive revisions feel misaligned with my goal of meaningful impact. I could start by documenting my contributions and seeking feedback to align my work with my value of purpose.  \n\n**2. If you had to prioritize one long-term goal or value (e.g., purpose, growth, or impact) that feels most out of reach in your current role, what is one small, concrete step you could take this month to move closer to it while maintaining financial stability?**  \n\nI’d prioritize building a side project aligned with my values, even if it’s small, to experiment with growth and purpose outside my current role.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties**:  \nI worry that focusing on small changes might feel insufficient or like a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution. I’m also unsure how to balance boundary-setting with maintaining professional relationships without appearing uncooperative.  \n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance**:  \nThis feels empowering because it shifts the focus from feeling stuck to taking actionable steps. The emphasis on small, sustainable changes makes the process less overwhelming and more achievable. I appreciate how the guidance acknowledges the tension between stability and alignment, offering a practical way to bridge that gap.",
