      "text": "**Response:**  \n\nThank you for helping me clarify how to use my current job’s resources to develop skills for my long-term goals. I’m transitioning from a corporate role into a career that aligns with my values, such as sustainability and community impact.  \n\nOne skill I want to build is project management, as it’s essential for roles in my target field. I plan to use my company’s training programs to complete a project management certification in the next six months. I’ll also apply these skills by volunteering to lead a small sustainability initiative within my team, even though it’s not part of my current role. I hope this will give me hands-on experience while demonstrating my commitment to the company.  \n\nI’m still uncertain about how to balance these efforts without overextending myself or my time, but I’m excited about the possibility of turning my current job into a platform for growth.  \n\n**Reaction to Guidance:**  \nI appreciate how you’ve emphasized leveraging existing resources and setting measurable milestones. This advice feels practical and empowering, and it’s given me a clearer sense of how to start building toward my long-term goals without feeling overwhelmed.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nI’d love to discuss how to approach my manager about taking on these new responsibilities in a way that feels authentic and aligns with my goals.",
