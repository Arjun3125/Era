      "text": "**1. What is one low-risk, incremental step you could take within your current role...**  \n\nI could dedicate one hour each week to learning a new skill related to my long-term goals, such as taking an online course on a free platform like Coursera or Khan Academy. This would allow me to explore alignment with my values without affecting my current job or financial stability.  \n\n**2. What is one specific milestone...**  \n\nI would define a milestone of completing one online course by the end of the year. To track progress, I could use a simple app like Duolingo or a journal to log my daily study time and track my completion rate. This would help me measure my progress and stay motivated.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how much time this might realistically take, especially with a full-time job. I’m also unsure if completing an online course will feel like enough progress compared to my long-term goals.  \n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI think this guidance is really helpful because it breaks down the problem into manageable steps. Having a clear milestone and a way to track progress makes the process feel less overwhelming and more achievable. I appreciate the focus on low-risk actions that still allow for meaningful growth.",
