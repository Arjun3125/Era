      "text": "**1. What specific, low-risk experiments could I test?**  \nI could start by building a portfolio of projects in my target field, such as creating a personal website or contributing to open-source initiatives. I’d also like to explore freelance opportunities on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to test my interest and skills. Additionally, I could take online courses to upskill in areas relevant to my desired career path, like UX design or digital marketing.\n\n**2. How might I use my current job’s resources to build a transition plan?**  \nI could leverage my job’s professional development resources, such as training programs or mentorship opportunities, to build skills for my target field. Networking with colleagues or attending company events could help me gather insights about my desired industry. I’d also like to save a portion of my income to create a financial safety net, allowing me to transition more confidently when the time feels right.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns or uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how much time these experiments will take, especially since I still have a full-time job. I’m also unsure how to balance these efforts with my current responsibilities without overwhelming myself or appearing disloyal to my employer.\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI appreciate the emphasis on low-risk experiments and gradual transitions. It gives me a clear path forward without the pressure of immediate change. I’m excited to start building my portfolio and networking, but I’ll need help prioritizing these tasks to ensure I can sustain them alongside my job.",
