This step helps you build a **decision-making framework** to align actions with outcomes.  \n- **Consequences drive focus.** Understanding the cost of inaction (e.g., burnout, missed opportunities) can create urgency and clarity. This isn’t about fear—it’s about **strategic trade-offs** that align with your values.  \n\n---\n\n**Next Step:**  \nIf you’re ready, share your answers to these questions. From there, we can:  \n- Build a **prioritization framework** tailored to your goals,  \n- Identify **non-essential commitments** that drain your energy,  \n- Create a **progress-tracking system** to stay aligned with your priorities.  \n\nIf you’re unsure, I’ll guide you through a simple exercise to map out your goals and their potential impact.  \n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed.",

      "text": "**1. How do you currently evaluate the importance of competing goals or commitments?**  \nI often rely on a gut feeling or a sense of urgency, but I rarely take the time to assess the long-term impact of each task. I end up juggling multiple things without a clear framework, which leads to scattered efforts and frustration. For example, I might prioritize a task that feels immediate but doesn’t align with my core values or long-term goals.\n\n**2. What would be the immediate and long-term consequences of *not* making progress toward your top priorities?**  \nIn the short term, neglecting key goals might mean missed deadlines or incomplete projects, but the long-term consequences could be more significant. I’d likely feel a deeper sense of regret and unfulfillment, and I might lose momentum in areas that truly matter to me, like personal growth or meaningful relationships. Staying stuck in reactive mode instead of proactive planning could lead to burnout or a lack of direction.\n\n**Reflection on the guidance:**  \nI appreciate how this approach shifts the focus from feeling overwhelmed to taking intentional action. I’m ready to try building a prioritization framework, but I’d like some help tailoring it to my specific situation.",
