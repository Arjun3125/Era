      "text": "**1. What specific aspects of your current role (e.g., tasks, relationships, growth opportunities) are contributing most to your sense of being \"drained\" or unfulfilled, and how might these be addressed without compromising financial stability?**  \nThe repetitive tasks and lack of growth opportunities are draining me. I feel stuck, which affects my motivation and overall well-being. If possible, I’d like to explore ways to address these issues without jeopardizing my financial stability, such as seeking internal role adjustments or skill development opportunities.\n\n**2. If you were to prioritize your long-term happiness and fulfillment over financial stability, what *minimum thresholds* would you need to meet (e.g., purpose, impact, autonomy) to justify a major career or life shift?**  \nI’d need to meet thresholds like purpose-driven work, opportunities for growth and impact, and a healthy work-life balance. If my current role can’t provide these in the foreseeable future, I’d justify a shift toward a path that aligns more closely with these needs.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties**:  \nI’m worried about the potential risks of changing paths, but I’m also concerned about the long-term consequences of staying in a role that doesn’t align with my values or goals. I’m unsure how to balance the need for stability with the desire for fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n**Reaction to your guidance**:  \nYour questions helped me clarify my priorities and the specific areas I need to address. I feel more confident in evaluating my options and defining the thresholds I need to meet for fulfillment. Thank you for helping me focus on what truly matters.",
