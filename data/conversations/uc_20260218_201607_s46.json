      "text": "**Response:**  \n\nThank you for helping me clarify this step by step—it’s been really helpful to focus on the non-negotiable aspects of my long-term goals. I’m transitioning from a corporate tech role into a purpose-driven field, and my top priority is finding work that aligns with my values, such as social impact and sustainability.  \n\nOne way I’m trying to integrate this into my current role is by advocating for projects that align with these values. For example, I’ve been exploring how I can lead a team effort to implement eco-friendly practices or analyze the company’s environmental impact using data tools I’m already familiar with.  \n\nI’m still unsure how much of this I can realistically do without overstepping or risking my current position. But I’m excited to start testing it out.  \n\n**Reaction to Guidance:**  \nI appreciate how you’ve emphasized identifying core values and building momentum through small steps. It’s given me a clearer path forward without feeling overwhelmed.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nI’d love to discuss how I can frame my proposal to align with company priorities while still reflecting my personal values.",
