This step ensures your actions are driven by purpose, not urgency.  \n- **Systems > Willpower.** Sustainable focus requires **designing habits and boundaries** that work with your energy, not against it. This isn’t about “trying harder”—it’s about **working smarter**.  \n\n---\n\n**Next Step:**  \nIf you’re ready, share your 1–2 most important goals or values. From there, we can build a tailored plan to help you:  \n- Eliminate distractions,  \n- Allocate energy effectively,  \n- Make consistent progress toward what matters.  \n\nIf you’re not sure where to start, I’ll help you explore potential goals using a simple framework (e.g., “What would I be doing if I had no limits?”).  \n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed.",

      "text": "**1. What are your 1–2 most important long-term goals or values?**  \nMy top long-term goal is to build a career that aligns with my values (e.g., creativity, impact, and authenticity) and allows me to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I value personal fulfillment and meaningful progress, but I often feel pulled in too many directions, making it hard to focus on what truly matters.\n\n**2. What systems, habits, or boundaries could you implement to filter out distractions?**  \nI’d like to implement systems that help me prioritize tasks and set boundaries to protect my time and energy. For example, I’d like to create a daily ritual to review my priorities and eliminate tasks that aren’t essential. I’m also interested in learning how to say no to commitments that don’t align with my goals.\n\n**Reflection on the guidance:**  \nI found this guidance helpful because it emphasized the importance of alignment and sustainable habits. I’m ready to explore potential goals and refine them with your help. I’m also open to discussing how to balance structure and flexibility in my work style.",
