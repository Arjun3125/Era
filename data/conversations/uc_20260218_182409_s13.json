      "text": "1. **What specific moments or tasks in your current role leave you feeling emotionally drained, and how might you reframe or approach them differently to reduce that drain while staying within your role’s boundaries?**  \n   Tasks like recurring meetings that lack clear agendas or project revisions that require constant feedback feel draining. I could reframe these by setting boundaries—limiting meeting time, preparing agendas beforehand, and focusing on outcomes rather than just participation. For revisions, I’d focus on asking clarifying questions instead of over-apologizing for my work.  \n\n2. **If you had to align your current role with one of your long-term values (e.g., purpose, growth, impact) in a way that feels doable this month, what small, concrete step could you take to begin that alignment?**  \n   I’d prioritize documenting my contributions to projects, even in small ways, to align with my value of purpose. This could include maintaining a log of tasks completed and their outcomes, which might also help me identify areas where I can grow or impact the team.  \n\n---\n\n**Concerns and uncertainties**:  \nI worry that focusing on small adjustments might feel insufficient or like a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution. I’m also unsure how to balance boundary-setting with maintaining professional relationships without appearing uncooperative.  \n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance**:  \nThis feels empowering because it shifts the focus from feeling stuck to taking actionable steps. The emphasis on small, sustainable changes makes the process less intimidating and more achievable. I appreciate the practicality—it gives me permission to start aligning my daily work with my values without overwhelming myself.",
