I’d also like guidance on how to measure progress and adjust the plan if needed.  \n\n---\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI’m excited about the idea of testing low-impact experiments and building a transition roadmap. It feels structured and manageable, but I’d appreciate more advice on prioritization and progress tracking to ensure I stay on track without burning out.",
