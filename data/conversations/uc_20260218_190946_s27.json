I’d also like to build my network by connecting with professionals in my target field through LinkedIn or industry events. Additionally, I could take on new responsibilities at work, such as volunteering for cross-functional projects, to gain experience and visibility.\n\n**2. How might I use my current job’s resources to explore my target field?**  \nI could leverage my job’s mentorship program to get advice from experienced colleagues or ask my manager for opportunities to shadow roles in my target field. I’d also like to experiment with freelance work or side projects in my desired industry to test my interest and build a portfolio.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns or uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how much time I can realistically dedicate to these actions without overwhelming my current workload. I’m also unsure how to approach my employer about these opportunities without seeming disloyal or disruptive.\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI appreciate the emphasis on proactive growth and low-risk exploration. It feels like a practical way to align my goals with my current job while maintaining financial security. I’d like to hear more about how to balance these efforts with my job responsibilities.",
