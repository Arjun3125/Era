      "text": "**Response:**  \n\nThank you for helping me clarify this step by step—it’s been really helpful to think about how I can strategically repurpose my current experience. In my current job, I’ve been handling project coordination and data organization, which I think could be repurposed for roles in UX/UI design or data analysis. For example, I organize client feedback and project timelines, which involves a lot of attention to detail and understanding user needs—skills that could translate well to UX.  \n\nI’m still unsure how much of this experience I can directly apply, especially since I don’t have direct experience in the tech field. But I’m excited to start testing it out.  \n\n**Reaction to Guidance:**  \nI appreciate how you’ve emphasized repurposing existing skills and creating phased transitions. It’s given me a clearer path forward without feeling overwhelmed.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nI’d love to discuss how I can frame my current experience in a way that highlights it for roles in UX or data analysis, and how to take small steps to build confidence in those areas.",
