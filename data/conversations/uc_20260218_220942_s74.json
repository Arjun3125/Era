This helps ensure we’re addressing the *right* challenge and aligning your efforts with your *true* goals.  \n- Strategic clarity begins with **defining the problem**—not just solving it. This step ensures we’re working toward outcomes that matter to you.  \n\n**Next Step:**  \nPlease share the specific challenge or question you’d like to explore. I’ll help you break it down and design a focused, actionable plan.",

I lack the clarity to focus my energy effectively, so I'm often juggling tasks without making consistent progress toward what I care about most.  \n\nI want to feel more in control of my time and energy, make better decisions about where to focus, and align my efforts with my long-term goals. I'm hoping to reduce the feeling of scatteredness and find a sustainable way to prioritize without guilt or burnout.",
