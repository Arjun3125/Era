      "text": "**1. What specific skills or experiences could I develop?**  \nI could focus on developing skills like data analysis or digital marketing through online courses or certifications. I’d also like to gain experience by working on side projects or collaborating on internal cross-functional initiatives at my current job. This would help me build practical skills and confidence in these areas while staying employed.\n\n**2. How might I use my current job’s resources to test my target field?**  \nI could leverage my job’s networking opportunities, such as connecting with colleagues in roles I’m interested in or asking for shadowing opportunities. I’d also like to experiment with taking on additional responsibilities or small projects that align with my target field to see if it’s a good fit.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns or uncertainties:**  \nI’m worried about how much time I can realistically dedicate to learning new skills without overwhelming my current workload. I’m also unsure how to approach my employer or colleagues about these opportunities without seeming uncommitted or disruptive.\n\n**Reaction to the guidance:**  \nI appreciate the emphasis on proactive growth and leveraging existing resources. It feels like a practical way to explore my target field without making a full transition. I’d like to hear more about how to balance these efforts with my current job responsibilities.",
