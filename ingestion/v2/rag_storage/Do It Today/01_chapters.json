    "raw_text": "About The Author (That’s Me)\nI’m an entrepreneur, blogger, and podcaster. Since 2015,\nI’ve been sharing my thoughts about life, business, and\nproductivity on my blog. Until now, more than 4 million\npeople have read my articles. I also co-founded Vartex, a\nlaundry technology company, with my dad, while I was\nﬁnishing my master’s degree in Marketing in 2010. For my\npodcast, The Darius Foroux Show, I’ve interviewed thought\nleaders like Ryan Holiday, Robert Sutton, Jimmy Soni, and\nmore.\nThis is the third book that I’ve published. My other books\nare:\nWin Your Inner Battles: Defeat The Enemy Within\nand Live With Purpose\nTHINK STRAIGHT: Change Your Thoughts, Change\nYour Life\n\f\nAbout This Book\nAs I’m writing this, I’m blocked from accessing my email\nprovider that I use to send out my weekly newsletter. This\nemail provider is the most important service I use to run my\nblog. It’s equally important as my blog itself.\nThe reason I can’t access my email provider and send\nemails to my subscribers (even new subscribers who join my\nnewsletter are not receiving my welcome email) is that I’m\nbeing “list-bombed.” It happens when spammers bomb your\nemail list signups with emails from people who didn’t want\nto sign up for your list. And now, I’m known as a spammer\nbecause I send emails to people who didn’t sign up for\nthem. At least, this what a website that lists spammers says.\nIn their eyes, I’m a spammer. Am I one? Of course not. I\nhave a life. However, publishing weekly articles and staying\nin touch with my readers is also a part of my life. And that’s\nbeen taken away from me now.\nThe irony is that I migrated to this provider ten days ago.\nI’ve spent dozens of hours on that process.\nNormally, I would get pissed oﬀ about this situation and\nstart blaming someone. After all, I invested a lot of time in\nbuilding a large email list. And for a moment, I did get upset\nabout being blocked from it. But you know what I did next?\nI started doing something else that’s important. I started\nthis book.\nJust like that. I moved on to the next thing. Life doesn’t stop.\nAnd every single second, we’re getting closer to death.\nI must say, three years ago, I was far away from the person\nthat I am today. I would complain, feel sorry for myself,\nblame others, and I would never have acted on anything\n\f\nmeaningful. But through reading, journaling, and blogging\nevery week, I have transformed my life.\nLike a sculptor, I shaped my philosophy for life during that\nperiod. My philosophy can be summarized in three words,\nand it’s the title of this book: Do it today.\nLook, I don’t have to tell you that life is ﬁnite, and that time\nis not replenishable. Every second we invest in something is\ntime that we can never get back. But I want to challenge\nyou to look at the bigger picture.\nWhat you do today determines where you will be in a year,\ntwo years, and even ten years from now. Every single day,\nwe keep on doing things that we don’t desire. I’m not talking\nabout paying the bills or cleaning your toilet. I’m talking\nabout how you invest the majority of your time. The time\nthat sums up your life.\nWhen I was 13 or 14 years old, I watched the movie Fight\nClub for the ﬁrst time together with one of my friends. One\nline has been engraved on mind ever since that moment:\n“You are not your job, you're not how much money you have\nin the bank.” I’m glad I watched that movie back then. I’ve\nwatched the movie more than a dozen times, and I’ve read\nthe book more than once. That single thought inspired me\nto become independent. I’m not my job. And I’m certainly\nnot my bank account.”\nBut who are we, if we are not those things?\nFor the past 17 or 18 years, I’ve been meditating on that\nquestion. As of now, I believe that we are our actions. And\nour actions reveal our character. That’s who we are.\nThe funny thing is that we are our job. After all, we spend\nthe majority of our time earning a living. We trade time for\nmoney. Whether you like it or not, you have to spend a part\nof your life doing that. Most people end up trading time for\n\f\nmoney during their entire life. But a few of us spend their\ntime in a way now, that they have a better life tomorrow.\nThat’s why I always do it today—especially the important\nthings like:\nReading\nExercising\nInvesting\nSaving\nSpending time with people I love\nLaughing\nBooking a holiday\nEnjoying my life\nAnd yes, even paying the bills. No matter what happens, I\ndo the important things today—not tomorrow.\nFind Out What’s Important To You\nThis book is not about life hacks, productivity tips, or any\nother tactics. We all know about those things. Sure, now and\nthen I share tactical advice that I’ve applied to achieve more\nin less time. However, this book contains a collection of\narticles that I handpicked to help you get more clarity in life.\nThe recipe for a good life is simple: Get clear on what you\nwant and eliminate everything else from your life. The\nprocess is simple, yet it took me many years to ﬁgure those\nthings out.\nAnd this book is my journey. Sure, you can ﬁnd the articles\nin this book on my blog, but they are not presented in the\nright order. A blog is organic. I write about the challenges\nthat I face. But with a book, I can give you a structured body\nof work that serves a speciﬁc purpose.\nDo It Today is my path and blueprint for overcoming the\nendless procrastination, improving my productivity, and\n\f\ngetting more meaningful things done. And it can be yours\ntoo.\nHow This Book Is Constructed\nThere are three parts to this journey. In Part I, we start with\nchanging the way we look at life. No more procrastination.\nNo more feeling sorry. No more regrets.\nYou know, my grandmother was ill for the last few years of\nher life. She went on and on about the things she didn’t do\nin life. Sure, she talked about the good things too. But the\nregret was more powerful. Research even shows that\nnegative emotions have a bigger impact on our psyche than\npositive ones.\nSo, before I show you how to use your time eﬀectively, and\nget more things done, I want to focus on our mindset. That’s\nwhat Part I is about: Shifting from a passive state to an\nactive state. By the end of Part I, I hope that you decide to\ngrab life by the head and say, “I’m in charge.”\nWhen you’re in charge of your life, and therefore your time,\nit’s the perfect moment to get the best bang for your buck.\nBecause that’s all that productivity is: An optimum use of\ntime. In Part II, I have collected the articles that show you\nhow to do that. You’ll ﬁnd more than just “do this and you’ll\nboost your productivity” type of ideas. I take a diﬀerent\nroute to productivity. For example, one of the articles is\nabout reading 100 books in a year. It’s not necessarily about\nproductivity, but it does show you how I approach\nsomething that’s important to me. When you decide you\nwant to do something, you also must have a map that takes\nyou there. In life, we have to make that map. So, when you\nread the article about reading more books, look at my\nthinking process. Look at how I go about my challenge. Only\nthen you can apply the strategies to your own life."

    "raw_text": "Finally, in Part III, I show you how to stay on the path. It’s\neasy to read an article or listen to some advice and apply it\nfor a day. But that’s useless. We only make real progress\nand achieve big things by doing small things every single\nday. For instance, one of the articles in Part III is about the\npower of compounding. When you do the little things every\nday, they add up. And over time, they form big things like a\nstrong body & mind, self-reliance, a large investment\nportfolio, and so forth. One thing that I’ve learned about\ncompounding is that you can also compound hurtful things.\nWhen you complain every day, eat junk food, and never\nwork out, those things add up too. That’s how we become\nmiserable. You almost never hear about how one single\nmoment destroyed a person’s life. Of course, tragedies\nhappen. But for the majority of us, we simply let life slip\naway from us. We decide not to do it today. Because “what’s\nthe point?” Well, here’s the point: Life is good if you know\nhow to live it.\nThe 30 articles that I present in this book, form a system\nthat’s unshakeable (I’ve formatted the articles specially for\nKindle, to make them more readable. And I’ve made several\nimprovements to many articles, based on new lessons I\nlearned and the feedback I’ve received from readers.)\nWhen you adopt the habits that I write about in this book,\nyou can take on any challenge that life throws at you. You\nno longer have to wish that life was easier, you’re stronger\nnow.\nAs I write this, the sun is shining, there are no clouds, it’s 28\ndegrees Celsius (82 Fahrenheit), and I’m sitting shirtless\nbehind my desk in my home—listening to the Chilled-Out\nElectronic playlist on Apple Music. And all I can think is, “life\nis good.”\n\f\nLet’s get started, my friend.\n-Darius\nJune 7, 2018\nLeeuwarden, The Netherlands.\n\f\nHow To Read This Book\nBefore you start, I want to share a few lessons I learned\nabout reading a book—especially a practical one like this.\n1. There no rules to reading a book so feel free to read\nit in any way or order you want.\n2. Skip the parts that are not relevant to you. No, you\ndon’t have to read a book cover to cover.\n3. Highlight text and take notes to remember more.\n4. Skimming a book before you read it can be\nbeneﬁcial. I often skim a book, so I can get a better\nunderstanding of what I should skip or focus on.\nSometimes, I ﬁnd out that I can’t skip anything.\nSometimes, I skip half of a book.\n5. You only need one idea that can change your life. If\na book gives you only one good piece of advice, it’s\nalready worth your time.\n \nHappy reading."

    "raw_text": "Part I: Overcoming\nProcrastination\n \n \n“You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by\nevading it today.”\n \n- Abraham Lincoln\n\f\nDo It Today, Not Tomorrow\nEvery time I put oﬀ a decision, hit the snooze button,\nskipped the gym, or didn’t complete my tasks because I\ndidn’t feel like it, I always had an explanation for my\ncontinual procrastination.\nI told myself I was tired. Or that it could wait until tomorrow.\nWho cares if you put oﬀ something, right?\nWell, you should care. Because you’re the one who’s\nresponsible for your life. Too often, we look at productivity\ntips, apps or tools as the magic answer to our problems. But\nthat also means we allow ourselves to blame external things\nfor our lack of productivity.\n“No, it’s not me, it’s my old laptop. It sucks, and I\ncan’t work this way.”\n“The oﬃce is too loud.”\n“People keep calling and emailing me.”\n“I never have time.”\nBattling procrastination is an inner battle. I have many\nexamples of that in my personal life. In 2013, I felt my\ncareer was stuck. Two years before that, I started a\ncompany with my dad. But after two years, I became\nrestless because I wanted to do more and learn more.\nSo I did some freelancing. I built websites, did copywriting,\ncontent marketing, and some design work. But it didn’t take\noﬀ. Why? I never did the uncomfortable work. Instead, I\nfound a job to escape those hard tasks.\nWe all escape at times.\nBuilding a business or career is hard. It requires you to do\ndiﬃcult, tedious, and unsatisfying tasks. If you want more\nclients or work, no one is going to hand it to you. You have\n\f\nto hustle. Do content marketing, one-on-one sales, network,\nor whatever method you use to grow your business.\nAnd if you want to climb the corporate ladder, you have to\nform alliances, be strategic, outperform your targets, and be\ngreat at what you do.\nThat’s what you SHOULD do, right? Most of us already know\nthese things. Or, you will ﬁnd out about it. There’s no such\nthing as a secret to succeeding at work. However, we prefer\nto escape work. And that’s at the core of procrastination to\nme. You know what you have to do, but you don’t do it.\nInstead, you open a news site and start reading useless\nnews items. Or you browse your Instagram feed without\nliking one picture because you hate your life. Maybe you\nbrowse Zara, H&M, Net-A-Porter, Mr. Porter, or whatever\nonline shop you like.\nThat was, and to a degree still is, the story of my life. For\nexample, I’m now working on a new book. I know what it’s\nabout and I also have a title. But writing is also very diﬃcult\nwork to me.\nSo I look for relief. I answer emails, read articles, go for\ncoﬀee, do some online shopping, and work on recurring\ntasks to run my business. It’s not that I’m disorganized. It’s\nbecause I’m battling myself. Steven Pressﬁeld calls this\ninner enemy Resistance in his classic, The War Of Art. And\nthis is what he says about it:\n“Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.”\nDo It Today, Not Tomorrow\nI always have to keep reminding myself of that. When you\nprocrastinate, you always want to do it tomorrow. I’m still\nlike that. I think that’s hardwired into us. The diﬀerence\nbetween me now, and three years ago is small but simple: I\n\f\nrely on a system to live a productive, happy, and purposeful\nlife.\nBack then I had no idea how to get things done. I always\ngave up quickly, felt stuck, unhappy, and frustrated. But\nnow, I’ve found a way to overcome my challenges. Here’s\nhow I did it:\nI exercise my mental toughness every day. I\nused to neglect my brain. I was mentally weak,\nthought too much, and didn’t rely on myself. It\nwasn’t because I lacked skills. It was because I\ndidn’t trust in my ability to ﬁgure things out. So I\nstarted reading about Stoicism, Pragmatism and\nMindfulness; anything that helps you to control your\nthoughts and improve your mental toughness. I\ndon’t want to be a slave to my thoughts. I want the\nopposite.\nI exercise my body every day. When I don’t\nexercise, I’m restless, lack focus, energy, and\nconﬁdence. By exercising my brain and body every\nday, I’m always war-ready. I learned that\novercoming procrastination starts before you ﬁght\nthe war. Soldiers don’t go to war untrained either,\nright? Be in great shape, mentally and physically.\nAlways.\nI have a set of daily habits that help me to be\nin control of my life. I journal, read, set daily\npriorities, and don’t consume useless information. I\nalso make sure I interact with my friends and family\nevery day. Human contact is important. This keeps\nme grounded. I don’t have high expectations of life.\nAnd I enjoy my days. I never look beyond that.\nI always have a list of small (but important)\ntasks that I have to complete. Let’s take my\nnew book for example. I often want to escape\ndiﬃcult things like actually sitting down and writing.\nSo I tell myself today is not a good day. But every\n\f\ntime I think that, I open my list of small tasks and\nwork on one of those things TODAY.\nI study and practice the science of persuasion\nto get my message across. My mentor taught\nme: “You can be the best writer and teacher in the\nworld, but if no one knows about it, you can’t make\nan impact.” The science of persuasion helps you to\nwrite better pitches, cover letters, website copy,\nemails, etc.\nOf course, it takes time to develop the foundation of this\nstrategy. And there’s a lot more to it. But it’s not magic.\nHowever, it’s also not easy to live a productive life. And it’s\ndeﬁnitely not about technology or hacks. It’s about\ndeveloping a sustainable system to build your life, career,\nand business on. What’s your system for living a productive\nlife?\nWhatever it is: Work on it today. Not tomorrow.\n\f\nWhat I Do When I Can’t Focus\nDo you struggle to ﬁnish your tasks? Are you always\ndistracted by notiﬁcations, gossiping, or anything that’s\nrandom? In that case, you and I are alike. Because focusing\non a single thing is one of the hardest things at work.\nThere’s always something that interrupts you, right?\nAnother person\nA call\nA meeting\nA false emergency\nYour cat\nA stranger’s cat\nNews about last night’s NBA game\nSure, you can blame those things — but that’s weak. You\nand I both know that those things can’t interrupt you\nwithout your permission. That means every time you’re not\nfocused; you’re giving someone or something permission to\nenter your mind. Scary, isn’t it?\nThat’s how I look at interruptions. But I have to admit that I\ncan’t maintain my focus all the time. Sometimes, I give in.\nIt’s not good. Your life doesn’t beneﬁt from gossiping,\nlooking at Instagram 439 times a day, watching 49 YouTube\nvideos, and reading negative news articles. So, what can\nyou do to improve your focus? Here are 2 things that I\nalways do when I ﬁnd myself not being able to focus on\nwhat matters.\n1. Eliminate. Eliminate. Eliminate\nEvery day, we accumulate stuﬀ. I’m not only talking about\nthe stuﬀ you’re buying like clothes, kitchen equipment,\nhouse decorations, toys, gadgets, or whatever. We\n\f\naccumulate ideas. Have you ever thought about that? We’re\nexposed to so many ideas that we adopt some of them, and\nmake them our own. For example, many people have told\nme to create more YouTube videos. My family, friends, team\nmembers, readers, students — everybody has ideas. And\nthey want to help.\nLikewise, I also share my ideas with others. Ideas about how\nyou can improve your life, career, business, or relationships.\nWe all do it. And there’s nothing wrong with that. It only\nbecomes a problem if you don’t ﬁlter the input you get from\npeople. So after I heard from people that I should make\nYouTube videos, I thought to myself “Hey! I should make\nYouTube videos!”\nI’ve been thinking a lot about that for the past six months.\nAnd I also invested a lot of time in creating a strategy.\n“What should my videos be about? Where should I record\nthem? How should I edit them? What music should I use?”\nI’ve been working on it a lot. And I recently published a\nvideo as well. The response was positive. There’s only one\nproblem: It consumes too much of my time and attention.\nAs a consequence, I can spend less time on writing,\npodcasting, and creating new courses.\nAnd those are exactly the things that I want to do. I started\na blog for a reason: I love to write, and I’m good at it.\nTherefore, the work is easier, compared to creating YouTube\nvideos, which I’m not that good at. Plus, I thoroughly enjoy\nwriting articles, books, and material for my online courses.\nWhen the work gets hard, I don’t mind. But when I was\nworking on YouTube videos, I got frustrated a lot. And again,\nmy focus and work suﬀered from it. What did I do when I\nlacked focus? I asked myself this question:"

    "raw_text": "“What thing(s) should I eliminate to make my life so simple\nthat it’s easy to focus?”\nIn this case, I stopped focusing on YouTube. Elimination is a\nkey strategy that I use for many aspects of my life. We\naccumulate so much unnecessary baggage throughout the\nyears that we consistently need to eliminate:\nIdeas\nProjects\nWork\nObjects\nAnd so forth\nIf you ﬁnd yourself struggling to focus, try this strategy.\nMake your life so simple that it’s a breeze to live. And let’s\nbe honest here. Who wants to live a life that’s impossible?\nLife is already hard enough. Don’t make it harder.\n2. Think About Past Success\nThinking about past success and happiness stimulates the\nproduction of serotonin, a chemical nerve our cells produce.\nSerotonin is the key chemical that aﬀects every part of your\nbody. Serotonin plays a huge role in our bodily functions. But\nit also helps to reduce depression, increase libido, stabilize\nmood, control sleep, and regulate anxiety.\nSerotonin also plays a massive role in our general well-\nbeing. But here’s why serotonin matters to your focus.\nSerotonin also regulates delayed gratiﬁcation. When your\nserotonin activity goes down, it can lead to a lack of focus\non the long-term. You are less likely to act on your plans.\nWhen you lose focus, there’s a big chance that your\nserotonin activity is low. That’s why you are giving into\nshort-term pleasures like going out, drinking, shopping,\nhaving sex, watching TV, or anything else that gives you\nshort-term pleasure.\n\f\nTo improve your focus, boost your serotonin activity.\nResearch shows that exercise can do that. But something\nelse, that’s equally eﬀective, and a lot easier is a simple\nmind-exercise.\nAll you need to do is remember positive events that\nhappened in the past.\nAlex Korb, a neuroscientist at UCLA, and the author of The\nUpward Spiral, explains why remembering positive events\nhelps you to focus on what matters:\n“All you need to do [to increase serotonin levels] is\nremember positive events that have happened in your life.\nThis simple act increases serotonin production in the\nanterior cingulate cortex, which is a region just behind the\nprefrontal cortex that controls attention.”\nWhen serotonin goes up, your focus goes up. Ultimately,\nthat’s what you should do. I know that it sounds cheesy, but\nwhen something is wrong, you must ﬁx it.\nWhen I can’t focus, the ﬁrst thing I do is to acknowledge\nthat I have a problem that needs a solution. Some people go\nthrough life without even acknowledging that they have\nproblems.\nNo, it’s not normal to check your phone every 2\nminutes.\nNo, it’s not normal to gossip all the time.\nNo, it’s not normal to be bored.\nFocus on your life. Think about what matters to you. Then,\ndo those things and don’t get distracted — stay on the path.\nGood luck.\n\f\nHow To Beat Procrastination\n(backed by science)\nProcrastination has been around since the start of modern\ncivilization. Historical ﬁgures like Herodotus, Leonardo Da\nVinci, Pablo Picasso, Benjamin Franklin, Eleanor Roosevelt,\nand hundreds of others have talked about how\nprocrastination is the enemy of results. One of my favorite\nquotes about procrastination is from Abraham Lincoln:\n“You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by\nevading it today.”\nThe funny thing about procrastination is that we all know\nthat it’s harmful. Who actually likes to procrastinate? No one\nenjoys doing that. Me neither. And yet, procrastination was\nthe story of my life. When I was in college, every semester,\nthis would happen:\nIn the beginning of each semester, I was the coolest dude\non the planet. Relaxing, going out, enjoying myself. Big\ntime. I experienced no stress whatsoever. However, about a\nweek before my exams, I would freak out.\n“Dude, why didn’t you begin earlier?” I would tell myself."

    "raw_text": "And what would follow is an ugly sight of me, with a bunch\nof Red Bull cans, locked up in my room — freaking out while\nI was studying. And research shows exactly that: When you\nprocrastinate, you might feel better on the short-term, but\nyou will suﬀer in the long-term. It doesn’t really matter why\nyou procrastinate. Some love the pressure of deadlines.\nSome are afraid to fail so they put it oﬀ until the very last\nmoment.\nOne thing that all procrastinators have in common is that\nprocrastination has a price. This highly cited study,\npublished in the American Psychological Society journal, by\nDianne Tice and Roy Baumeister discusses the cost of\nprocrastination. It is related to:\nDepression\nIrrational beliefs\nLow self-esteem\nAnxiety\nStress\nProcrastination is not innocent behavior. It’s a sign of poor\nself-regulation. Researchers even compare procrastination\nto alcohol and drug abuse. It’s serious. And I’ve experienced\nthat for many years.\nThe years after I got out of college were also a struggle in\nterms of starting and ﬁnishing work. Procrastination is a\nhabit that just sneaks into your system. It’s not something\nyou can shake easily. Every time I had a business idea or\nwanted to start something, it went like this:\n\f\nEvery time I had an idea or a goal, I would start, but along\nthe way, things would go wrong. I went from start to total\nchaos. Distractions, other ideas, other opportunities, failure,\nnegative self-talk, etc., would get in the way. And the results\nare always the same: You never get anything done.\nBeating Procrastination\nTo me, the key ﬁnding from the study by Dianne Tice and\nRoy Baumeister is this:\n“The present evidence suggests that procrastinators enjoy\nthemselves rather than working at assigned tasks, until the\nrising pressure of imminent deadlines forces them to get to\nwork. In this view, procrastination may derive from a lack of\nself-regulation and hence a dependency on externally\nimposed forces to motivate work.”\nSelf-regulation, self-control, willpower, are all things that we\noverestimate. We think: “Yeah sure, I will write a novel in 3\nweeks.”\nIn our minds, we’re all geniuses and mentally strong. But\nwhen the work comes, we cop out. If you’re a procrastinator,\nyou can’t help but delay work. And that’s true for the small\nand big tasks.\n\f\nSure, everybody fears to step outside of their comfort zone\n— that’s why we call them comfort zones. It takes courage\nto make a bold move. But it sure doesn’t take any courage\nto complete small tasks like paying bills, printing out\nsomething for your boss, doing taxes, etc. The truth is:\nProcrastination has nothing to do with what you’re trying to\ndo — small or big, it can wait until later. It can always wait,\nright? For me, completing tasks, went like this:\nThere comes a moment between the start and end of a task\n—I call it the slope of procrastination—when you give\ninto one distraction. And that’s exactly the moment you give\nup being productive.\nYou start working on a task, you’re excited, you’re focused,\nbut then, after some time, you think: Let’s read the news for\na second. It always starts with just one thing. Then, you\nthink: I might as well watch one episode of Game Of\nThrones. Then, a video on YouTube—and then another one.\nThen, a little bit of Instagram browsing. And so forth. It\nalways ends with a bang: “This is the last time I‘m\nwasting my time!” Yeah, right.\nWillpower Doesn’t Work. Systems Do.\nWhat you really need is a system for doing work. A lot of\npeople shy away from routines, systems and frameworks\n\f\nbecause they want to have “freedom.”\nI’m sorry to disappoint you: Freedom is your enemy. The fact\nis that, if you want to get things done, you need rules. What\nare some things that research proved to be eﬀective?\nSelf-imposed deadlines.\nAccountability systems (commitment with friends,\nor a coach).\nWorking/studying in intervals.\nExercising 30 minutes a day.\nA healthy diet.\nEliminating distractions.\nAnd most importantly: Internal motivation.\nIf you combine the right productivity tactics, you have a\nproductivity system.\nThe deadlines create urgency, accountability will create\nresponsibility, working in intervals improves your focus,\nexercising will give you more energy, so does a healthy diet,\nand eliminating distractions will take away the temptations.\nBut there’s no system that can help you if you don’t have an\ninner drive. People overcomplicate that concept, but it’s\nsimple: Why do you do what you do?\nIf you don’t know. Make something up. If you know why\nyou’re doing something, even the most annoying tasks\nbecome bearable. It will become a part of the bigger\npicture.\nSo, instead of diving into work, take a step back, think about\nwhy you do what you do, and then rely on a system that\nsupports that. Not rocket science. Just science.\n\f\nHow To Stop Wasting Time and\nImprove Your Personal\nEffectiveness\nThe reason I research productivity is simple. I think that a\nproductive life equals a happy life. Also, if you’re more\nproductive than average people, you’ll advance faster in\nyour career. You learn more. You do more. And eventually\nare rewarded more.\nAnd when I talk about productivity, I talk about being\neﬀective. Because productivity doesn’t suggest that you get\nthe right things done. It just means you get a lot of stuﬀ\ndone. But that’s not what matters.\nEﬀectiveness, however, refers to getting the right things\ndone. And if you want to do your job well, earn money, live a\nmeaningful life, or learn skills, that is what matters the\nmost. Otherwise, you just run around in circles. You might\nappear busy, but you won’t achieve anything meaningful. In\nother words: It’s easy to do useless work. Work that doesn’t\nbring you closer to the outcomes you desire.\nResults matter the most.\nPractically, that means this: You might work for 50 hours a\nweek, but if you don’t experience any growth personally,\nemotionally, ﬁnancially, you’re not eﬀective. People often\nask me, “where do I begin?” To answer that question, I want\nto share one exercise that I teach in my productivity\ncourse, Procrastinate Zero.\nIt’s an exercise that I picked up from Peter Drucker’s The\nEﬀective Executive. To me, Drucker is the ﬁrst and best\n\f\nthinker when it comes to eﬀectiveness for knowledge\nworkers.\nMany of the books, articles, productivity tools, and\nproductivity apps you see these days are all in a way\ninﬂuenced by Drucker, who essentially invented the term\npersonal eﬀectiveness.\nWhat you will ﬁnd next is a simple exercise from The\nEﬀective Executive (which I modiﬁed slightly to make it\neasier) that you can apply to become more eﬀective\nyourself.\nStep 1: Know Thy Time\nI often hear people saying: “I don’t know what’s wrong with\nme. I keep procrastinating.”\nMy question is: “Do you know thy time?”\nIf you don’t measure your time, it’s tough to stop\nprocrastination or improve your productivity. Because if you\nwant to manage your time better, you have to know where\nit goes ﬁrst. Your memory is not suﬃcient. If I asked you\nwhat you were doing exactly one week ago at this time,\nwould you have an answer? There you go.\nHow do you know your time? Keep an activity log. Before I\neven have a real session with clients, I often ask them to\nkeep an activity log for two weeks. An activity log is exactly\nwhat you imagine — an hour by hour record of what you’re\ndoing throughout the day.\nThe speciﬁc method you use for your activity log doesn’t\nmatter. The only thing that matters is that you want to keep\na record for at least two weeks. Preferably, you want a\nwhole month of recorded activities.\nI just keep a pen and a notepad on my desk and every hour\nI write down the time and what I’ve done during the past\n\f\nhour. It’s important to keep the notebook visible, so you\ndon’t forget.\nStep 2: Identify The Non-Productive Work\nThis step is actually very simple. I just have one question for\nyou:\n“Go through all the recurring activities in your log one by\none. What would happen if you would stop doing them?”\nIf the answer is: “All hell breaks loose.” Don’t change\nanything. But if your answer is: “Nothing would\nhappen.” You’ve hit gold. We all do activities that have\nZERO return. I call those activities time-wasters.\nStep 3: Eliminate The Time-Wasters\nBoom. That’s it. Know where your time goes. Identify the\ncritical tasks from the trivial tasks in your life. And cut the\ntrivial, time-wasting, tasks. “That simple?” Yes. If you want\nto be a super eﬀective person, you regularly keep a log. You\ndon’t have to keep a log for 365 days a year. Instead, do two\nstretches of two-three weeks a year. That’s enough to keep\ntrack of your time and identify new time-wasters. Also, the\nadditional beneﬁt of such a simple exercise is that it forces\nyou to think about your daily routine.\nOften, we start time-wasting activities, and they become\nhabits. And if you don’t become aware of the pointless\nbehavior, it’s diﬃcult to break those bad habits. I’ve found\nthis exercise to be one of the most powerful things in\nproductivity. Start now. Your activity log probably looks\nsomething like this:\n(insert time) — Read Darius Foroux’ article about\nkeeping a time-log and started my own time-log.\n(insert time) — Turned oﬀ my phone and got back\nto (whatever you were working on).\n\f\n(insert time) — Browsed the news, Facebook,\nInstagram. And watched YouTube videos. (Be honest\nwith yourself. Shit happens).\n(insert time) — responded to emails.\nGreat. I’m happy to see that you started. Now keep going\nfor another two weeks.\n\f\nThe Habits Of Unproductive\nPeople You Don’t Want To Copy\nThe reason I study productivity is that I’m an unproductive\nperson. I truly am. I sleep too much. I talk too much. I read\ntoo much. I listen to music all day. I watch movies. I buy\ngadgets that turn me into a zombie.\nIf it weren’t for my productivity system, I’d get nothing\ndone. I wouldn’t even write this article. But if you browse\nsocial media, all you see is super productive, healthy, and\nwealthy people. Is that really the case? I don’t know. I just\nknow this: You can’t be productive 24/7. And a big part of\nbeing productive is about getting rid of unproductive habits\nwe all have.\nWhat follows is a list of ten unproductive habits that I\nlearned to do less, or eliminate. Do you have a few of these\nhabits? Don’t worry; we’re all unproductive at times. But if\nyou have ﬁve or more, it might be time to change. One\nthing is sure: No one wants to be an unproductive person.\nWorking Too Much\nSome days I can work 12 or 13 hours straight. I only take a\nbreak to exercise and eat. And I can keep that up for a few\ndays. But after a few days, there always comes a crash. Big\ntime. I struggle. I can’t get stuﬀ done. I don’ even want to\nget stuﬀ done. It’s not good. So I learned to be more\ncalculated with how much I work. Hemingway tried to stop\nat the height of his day.\nThat’s also my new goal. But that’s hard because we always\nwant things fast, fast, quick, quick, now, now. Just know\nyourself, your work, and your deadlines. Don’t have a"

    "raw_text": "deadline? Take it easy because you need that juice for\nstressful times. And most importantly: Have patience.\nWorrying Too Much\nWhat if I go broke? What if I lose my job? What if she doesn’t\nlove me? What if I get cancer? What if this plane crashes?\nWhat if I lose my sight? What if I…?\nYou got your head so far in the sand like an ostrich that you\ncan’t see how self-absorbed that way of thinking is. It’s\nalways about me, me, me. I know all about it. The above\nexamples are all from my personal life. I used to be the king\nof the ‘what if’ game. But here’s the thing: YOU’RE NOT\nGOING TO DIE RIGHT THIS SECOND. Get over yourself. Stop\nworrying. And do something useful. (I know, it’s not that\nsimple, but still: You can learn how to stop worrying.)\nBeing Stubborn\nWe deal with people all the time. Do you ever think: “Why\nshould I listen to this guy?” Or: “What does she know?” I\ndon’t know. Maybe more than you do? We just don’t know\nuntil we listen to others.\nBut if you always think you’re the best in the world, you\nnever give people a chance. I think everyone is stubborn.\nSome are extreme, and some are just a little stubborn.\nI must say, stubbornness is also a good trait. It’s good to be\ndeaf to critics and not about care what people think. But\nbeing stubborn in relationships is plain frustrating. That kind\nof stubbornness is not good. And it just so happens to be\nthat life is based on relationships. And your career too.\nSo when you refuse to work with others, you’re sabotaging\neveryone else that’s involved. Just remember that. I try to\nremind myself often that stubbornness can be bad. But\n\f\nsometimes it’s so bad I don’t even listen to myself. But I\nkeep trying.\nChecking Things\nWhat are you doing? “I was just checking Facebook.”\nWhat are you “checking”?\nEmail? TMZ? CNN? NBA? NFL? Instagram? Twitter?\nSnapchat?\nChecking is not a useful thing. It might be a verb, but it’s\nnot a real action. When I started blogging, I always checked\nmy stats for no reason. Then I thought: What’s the outcome\nof checking?\nNothing. You just consume information. I try to keep my\n“checking” at a minimum. That’s why I deleted all news and\nsocial media apps on my phone. I don’t even have email on\nmy phone. Otherwise, I check it all the time. I don’t want\nthat. I only want to check my email when I have time to\nanswer emails.\nChecking is a habit that you can never fully eliminate. I still\nfollow the NBA because I like it. Pick only 1 or 2 “checking”\nvices you actually like. Eliminate the rest. You’re not missing\nanything anyway.\nEscaping Life\nUntil two years ago, every time I’d get stressed out, I said\nstuﬀ like: “I need a drink.” Or: “I have to go on a vacation.”\nAnd when I had issues at work or in my relationship that\nbecame too much to handle, I preferred to pretend they\ndidn’t exist. Sometimes I would take some time to talk\nabout it. But there are always deeper issues at play. Back\nthen I didn’t like my job, relationship, and the city I lived in. I\nbasically didn’t like my life.\n\f\nDid I change it? Nope. I always tried to escape my issues.\nEscaping problems gives you some stamina to face your\nshitty life again. But you and I both know that problems\nnever go away until you grab them by the root and\nextinguish them. I learned that the hard way. These days I\ndeal with problems before they become big problems.\nSaying Yes\nMost people are afraid to say no. Maybe you don’t want to\nlet people down. Maybe you are uncomfortable with the\nword no. I don’t know. Doesn’t matter, really. What matters\nis this: If you keep saying yes, you’re living someone else’s\nlife.\nThink about it. Deep down, we all know that it’s true. We’re\nnot even in control of our own time. Want to be in full\ncontrol of your life? Say no to a million things and yes to a\nfew things that matter.\nNot Writing Things Down\nYeah, yeah, you have the memory of an elephant. Or you’re\nso smart that you remember everything, right?\nWRONG. Not writing down your thoughts, ideas, tasks, etc,\nis stupid. Why? Because you’re wasting a lot of brain power\nwhen you rely on your memory. When you write everything\ndown, you can use your brainpower for other things. Like\nsolving problems. That’s actually useful and advances your\ncareer.\nIf you journal, that’s even better. But I’ve found that not\neveryone likes the idea of journaling. So let’s just call it\n“writing things down.” What did you write down while you’re\nreading this article?\nBeing Hard On Yourself\n“I suck!” No, you don’t.\n\f\n“Why?” You got out of bed this morning, right?\n“Yeah.” Congratulations. You survived this hard thing called\nLIFE. Be proud of yourself. Everything you do after getting\nout of bed is a win.\nNeglecting Your Personal Education\n“Woohoo! I ﬁnished college. Goodbye lame old books!”\nIf that was you, no matter how long ago, you DO suck. Who\nlearns one thing and stops forever? I don’t even know why\nwe have that idea planted in our brain. I always thought that\nlearning stops when you get out of school. But the truth is:\nYour life stops when learning stops.\nInvest in yourself. Learn something. Read books. Get\ncourses. Watch videos. Do it from home or go places. It\ndoesn’t matter. Just learn new things. You’ll be more\nproductive and more excited about life.\nHating Rules\nI saved the best for last. Most people hate rules, right? It\nstarts when we’re kids. “Why do I have to do this? Why do I\nhave to do that?” Because it’s better for you! That’s why!\n(you weird kid) But when we’re adults, we don’t have to\nfollow the rules (other than actual rules set by the\ngovernment, but you get what I’m talking about.)\n“Rules are dumb!”\nThat’s what I always believed. I thought I was a maverick.\nBut I was an idiot. Rules are actually THE BEST thing about\nlife. Without rules, we would be hotdog eating pigs right\nnow.\nAnd when it comes to productivity, the ﬁrst rule is: Have\nrules. If you want to live without rules, go ahead. But life is\nnot Fight Club. Rules actually help us to solve problems and\nget the most out of life."

    "raw_text": "Josh Weltman, an advertising creative director for 25+\nyears, and the co-producer of Mad Men, put it well in his\nbook Seducing Strangers:\n“Solving a problem requires a weird combination of freedom\nand constraint. Whenever I hear “Just have fun with it” or\n“Think outside the box,” I know from experience that things\nare about to turn into a colossal waste of time.”\nGood news: You make up the rules.\nFor example, one of my personal rules is this: Never\ncomplain. Another one is: Read and exercise every day. And:\nClose the day every evening by setting your next day’s\npriorities.\nWhen you combine all your productivity rules, you have a\nsystem. Voila! And a system changes everything.\nI rely on my system to work smarter, better, happier, and\neﬀectively. It took me years to ﬁgure out that a system is a\ngood thing, and a few more years to create one, but it was\nworth it. Because now, I get to be a productive person. Not\nbad for an unproductive person, huh?\n\f\nThis 30-Minute Evening Ritual Will\nHelp You To Kick Life In The Ass.\nAfter a busy day, it’s quite challenging to wind down and get\nready for a good night’s sleep. Too often I ﬁnd myself\nworking until late. And sometimes I might ﬁnd myself\nreading or watching a TV show.\nAnd when you’re ready to go to sleep, you can’t. Your mind\nis buzzing with thoughts you don’t want at that time of day.\nIt’s no secret that a lot of people have diﬃculties with\nsleeping. According to the National Sleep\nFoundation, 45% of Americans say that poor or insuﬃcient\nsleep aﬀected their daily activities at least once in the past\nseven days.\nWhy’s the evening so important? Well, you might have a\nperfect morning ritual, a fully planned calendar, and the\nintention to crush your day, but if you lack the energy,\nyou’re not doing anything productive. \nDuring the past six months, I’ve experimented a lot with\nevening and morning rituals. What I’ve found is that a\nmorning ritual is easy to implement in your life. But they’re\nalso easy to quit. When we wake up tired, we often fall back\non our, not helpful, habits.\nEnd result? You lose, and life wins. You end up not focused,\nour of control, agitated, and just not happy overall. That’s\nwhy I’ve created an evening ritual that helps me to get\nready for some well-deserved rest. We all know it: Get 7–9\nhours of sleep. But too often life gets in the way, and we\ndon’t follow common sense."

    "raw_text": "But with the following evening ritual, I’ve found a good way\nto bring more consistency in my evenings, and therefore,\nmy life.\nFrom minute 0 to minute 10: Close The Day\nEvery evening I take 10 minutes to journal about my day. In\na few sentences, I write about what I’ve accomplished, what\nI’ve learned, and anything that’s worth remembering. That\nsimple exercise helps me to:\n1. Remember what I did (sounds stupid, but we forget\nmost things we do).\n2. Review my progress and see whether I’m doing all\nthe things that I should be doing (like reading,\nworking out, spending time with my family, writing,\ntalking to people I work with).\nI’ve learned this exercise from Jim Rohn. He says:\n“At the end of each day, you should play back the tapes of\nyour performance. The results should either applaud you or\nprod you.”\nIt’s simple: Close the day before you start a new day. Also,\nclose every week before you start a new week. Similar for\nevery month, and every year. Sounds simple, right? It’s one\nof those “simple” ideas that have a huge impact on your\nlife.\nFrom minute 10 to minute 20: Review\nTomorrow’s Calendar\nThis is essential. When you wake up, you want to know\nexactly what your day is about. Do you have any important\nmeetings or calls? Deadlines, maybe? What do you have to\nget done? When are you working out? Do you have any\npressing items on your agenda? When are you dealing with\nthem?\n\f\nThis simple exercise takes away almost all stress and\nanxiety I have. Most anxiety comes from unsolved problems.\nAnd often, we worry about problems that are not real. But\nwhen you say to yourself: I’m going to work on problem X\nfrom 10 AM until 11 AM, you can relax.\nAlso, there’s nothing you can do late in the evening. Just go\nto bed, already. Leave the problem solving for tomorrow\nwhen your brain is fresh.\nFrom minute 20 to minute 25: Prepare your outﬁt\n“Oh, you’re so vain.” No, I don’t want to unnecessarily stress\nmy brain. Look, your brain is a muscle. And after a certain\namount of decisions, your brain runs out of juice. And that\nmeans the quality of your decisions will decrease.\nThat’s called Decision Fatigue. But I’m not worried about\nthat in the evening because I’m headed to bed so my brain\ncan recharge. A few extra decisions won’t hurt. However,\nthose few extra decisions will hurt your productivity if you\nthink about your outﬁt in the morning. So why not prepare\nyour outﬁt so you don’t have to use your precious\nbrainpower in the morning?\nFrom minute 25 till minute 30: Visualize\nBecause I’ve gone through my calendar earlier, I know what\nmy day will look like. Next up: Visualize the next day in\ndetail.\nCharles Duhigg talks about this exercise in his new\nbook Smarter Faster Better. Duhigg writes about how the\nmost productive people visualize their days with more\nspeciﬁcity than the rest of us. I prefer to do this exercise in\nthe evening because when I wake up in the morning, I still\nremember what I’ve visualized.\nThe result is: NO MORE snoozing.\n\f\nYou won’t believe how much I would hit the snooze button in\nthe past. In fact, I would snooze so often that the alarm on\nmy phone would just give up. The hardcore snoozers know\nwhat I’m talking about. Hit snooze so often, and you win.\nThe opposite is true. Snoozing is for losers. But I’m not\nlosing anymore because of this 30-minute evening ritual. As\na result, I go to sleep without stress, and I wake up with\nfocus: I exactly know what I have to do to turn the day into a\nsuccess. And that’s what I want to achieve with this ritual.\n30 minutes of your evening sounds like a pretty good ROI if\nyou want to improve your life.\nSo give it a try tonight and ﬁnd out for yourself. But don’t be\nsurprised if you wake up tomorrow morning ready to kick life\nin the ass."

    "raw_text": "Why Disconnecting From The\nInternet Improves Your Focus\nModern life is pretty good. You’re always connected to the\ninternet, inside your home, and outside of it. With your\nsmartphone, you have the world at your ﬁngertips. Sounds\ngreat, right? NOT. Most people don’t use technology but are\nrather used BY technology.\nApps, games, videos, articles, commercials, TV-shows, are\nall designed to keep your attention. So without you knowing\nit, you waste countless of hours every single week. Your\nattention is all over the place, but not at the right place.\n“To be everywhere is to be nowhere.”\n— Seneca\nWhy do you think Netﬂix automatically starts the next\nepisode in 3, 2, 1 seconds? When that happens, you think:\n“Screw it, let’s watch another episode.” The same goes for\nYouTube. Why do you think their suggestions are so good?\nThey keep you locked in. And this applies to all content.\nThere is ALWAYS a “next” video, episode, article, game,\nround, movie; you name it.\nFunnily enough, most people who read these type of articles\nknow that a lack of focus is bad. And in recent years, a large\nnumber of research papers and books have appeared about\nthe harmful eﬀects of distractions. Speciﬁcally, research\nshows that distractions are associated with more stress, and\nhigher frustration, time pressure, and eﬀort.\nDoing focused work is HARD. We’re always\ndistracted.\n\f\nAnd it’s not your fault. Most technology taps into your lizard\nbrain and locks you in — it turns you into a consumer. So\ndon’t even think about resisting the internet or technology. I\nbet you’ve tried it in the past. “I’m never going to browse\nmindlessly for hours.” Yeah, right!\nWhat will work? Recently, I wrote about how I beat\nprocrastination by creating a system. Well, one of the most\ncritical parts of that system is this:\nDISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET.\nAnd there’s only one reason to do that: Too much of\nanything is a bad thing. Even good things.\nToo much exercise? You will get overtrained.\nToo much love? You will smother people.\nToo much work? You will burn out.\nToo much food? You will get fat.\nToo much water? You will die.\nSo why do you consume so much internet? I asked myself\nthat question 2 years ago. I had no answer. So I thought; I\ndo everything else in moderation, why not the internet?\nSoon I found out that there’s no moderation with internet\nusage. It’s like an all-you-can-eat buﬀet. You’re already full,\nbut you still keep eating. And after you’ve stuﬀed yourself,\nthe regret will eat you up alive.\nAnd that’s the same with internet usage. It’s so tempting\nand satisfying, and available EVERYWHERE. So you go all\nout with it. YouTube, Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. I’m\nall about eliminating distracting stuﬀ. However, I also don’t\nwant to live my life as a recluse. So I had to ﬁnd a middle\nground that worked. I’ve found that a simple tweak in my\nattitude towards the internet did the trick.\nI went from “Always Connected” to “Always\nDisconnected.”\n\f\nIn practice, it works like this:\nOn my phone, wiﬁ and mobile data are standard oﬀ.\nI only turn it on when I need it.\nOn my laptop, I use an app called SelfControl during\nthe times I work (try FocusMe for Windows). The\napp blocks distracting sites. The advantage is that\nmy apps like Evernote, DayOne, Oﬃce 365 remain\nconnected so I can save my work in the cloud.\n“Always connected,” isn’t a good thing for your focus and\nproductivity.  It’s the same as going to the gym. Or having\ndinner. Or having a romantic evening with your partner. You\ndon’t do those things for 24 hours a day. You do them for\nthirty minutes, an hour, or a few hours. Too much of those\nthings is simply not eﬀective.\nBeing disconnected from the internet has worked wonders\nfor me. I don’t feel the urge to check my smartphone, email,\nor the news 500 times a day anymore.\nAnd after a while, you feel like you’re not missing out on\nanything. That brings a sense of calmness to your life. I also\nget more out of my days; I achieved more things than ever,\nfeel less distracted, and have more time to spend on the\nthings that make me happy.\nAt the end of the day, the internet is just a tool. However,\nsome of us think it’s everything. But I’m pretty conﬁdent\nthat, in years from now, I will not look back and regret that I\ndidn’t spend enough time on the internet.\nCan you imagine? You’re on your deathbed, and you’re\nsaying this to your family: “I’m glad I watched so many FAIL\ncompilations on YouTube.” Nope. You’ll probably look back\nand reﬂect on the time you spent with your family or\nfriends. Or the memories you made when you were\ntraveling. Or how much you enjoyed your work.\n\f\nSo cut the crap with the internet. It’s not giving you\nanything but frustration. And after reading this article;\ndisconnect. You will get some withdrawal symptoms like\ngrabbing your phone 100 times. Or hitting the F key on your\nkeyboard (for Facebook) all the time. But I’ll promise you\nthis: Disconnecting will help you DO more. And that’s what\nlife is about."

    "raw_text": "The Single Biggest Reason Most\nPeople Procrastinate In Life\nFor most of my life, I’ve been a habitual procrastinator.\nWhen I had my ﬁrst summer job at age 16, I did everything\nnot to work. I had an inside sales job at a telecom company,\nand I had to sell mobile contracts to clients.\nThe company had software that would automatically call the\nnext client when you ﬁnished a call. So you would be on the\nphone constantly — but I found a way around that process.\nAfter every call, you had to log your activity on the system.\nThings like “client is interested, but has to discuss it with her\ngrandson.” Yes, I sold to a lot of elderly people (not proud of\nit).\nAs a professional procrastinator, I took a lot of time to craft\na lengthy summary of the call. When my manager asked me\nabout my low number of calls per day, I told him, “If one of\nmy teammates calls the client, they know she had to talk to\nher grandson. That’s valuable information, right?”\nI did everything to put oﬀ the next call. I also procrastinated\nduring my years at university—pursuing a master’s degree\nin marketing. I always waited until the last moment to ﬁnish\nan assignment or study for an exam.\nI even procrastinated when I worked as a freelance\nmarketing consultant after I graduated. “I’m doing\nresearch.” This time, I told myself. I didn’t understand why I\nalways put oﬀ things to the last moment. I thought it was a\npart of my character. And many of my friends were similar;\nthey would say: “Who wants to work? Let’s have some\nbeer.”\n\f\nThis is what I believed: “Work is something you don’t like to\ndo — you just do it because you need money and status.”\nSadly, many of us believe that is the truth. Fortunately, my\nprocrastination behavior changed this year. It wasn’t some\nkind of magical productivity hack or software that turned me\ninto a productivity machine. I’m more productive and\nfocused than ever. And I’m more satisﬁed with my work\nthan in the past.\nDo you want to know the secret? I’m ﬁnally doing\nsomething that I love.\nThat’s it. Work is not bad at all — I love to write, that’s why I\ndo it 7 days a week. I didn’t like my previous jobs,\nbusinesses that I started, and I sure didn’t like to study for\nclasses I had zero interest in.\nPreviously, I thought that you procrastinate because you\nhave poor time management skills. That’s why I’ve tried\nevery productivity hack, system, or software, but they are\nall useless when you compare it to doing meaningful work.\nDo you want to get stuﬀ done? Do stuﬀ that matters.\nProductivity hacks get a lot of attention. And very often,\npeople present with time-management tips as a solution. In\na way, time-management reminds me of speed reading.\nMany of us want to speed read to ﬁnish more books in less\ntime. But why? I enjoy reading—I don’t want to spend less,\nbut more time on reading. It seems like we want to skip the\nactual work and only focus on the outcome.\nIt’s like Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle Is The\nWay, says in his article about speed reading: “If you ﬁnd\nyourself wanting to speed up the reading process on a\nparticular book, you may want to ask yourself, “Is this book\nany good?” Life is too short to read books you don’t enjoy\nreading.”\n\f\nI think you can apply Ryan’s quote to your life and career as\nwell: Life is too short to do work you don’t enjoy. No matter\nhow many productivity hacks you try, you won’t produce\nmore if you’re not passionate about what you do. If you ﬁnd\nyourself regularly procrastinating, you may want to ask\nyourself: Am I passionate about my work?\nIf the answer is no, you know what you have to do — ﬁnd\nsomething that you are so passionate about that you don’t\nwant to procrastinate for one second. We all know that time\nis ﬁnite, so why not behave accordingly? If you know that\nyou have limited time on this planet, why waste it?\n“We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet\nhave much more than we know what to do with. Our lives\nare either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing\nto the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We\nare always complaining that our days are few, and acting as\nthough there would be no end of them.”\n– Lucius Annaeus Seneca\nI’m a believer of ‘do what you’re passionate about’, but I’m\nalso a believer of ‘do what you’re good at.’ The sweet-spot\nis right in the middle — a job that you love, and are also\ngood at. Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich,\nsays that work and passion go both ways. He says that\nwhen we get really good at our job, we often become\npassionate about it.\nI’m not saying that productivity tips are useless. In fact, I’ve\nwritten about productivity tips that improved my output.\nWhat I am saying is that the best solution for procrastination\nis doing meaningful work.\nAnd procrastination can be a sign that you’re doing\nsomething that’s not meaningful. Don’t let procrastination\nbecome a habit. After all, the worst procrastination is\n\f\nputting oﬀ your dreams and goals. If you’re waiting for the\nright time, Benjamin Franklin says: “You may delay, but time\nwill not.” If you don’t listen to me, listen to him."

    "raw_text": "This Ancient Habit Will Maximize\nYour Focus\nEver since I was little, I worried about many things. My\nfavorite topics were money, health, and my future. What’s\nyour favorite topic to worry about? And don’t tell me you\nnever worry or fear nothing. Because if you have zero fear,\nthat means you’re a robot! Everyone spends time thinking\nabout things that will never happen. Because that’s what\nfear is. Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher,\nsaid it best:\n“My life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which\nnever happened.”\nWe all know that fear is meant to save us from trouble. But\nin the modern world, that’s simply not true anymore. These\ndays, fear is only something that occupies your mind.\nOur thoughts are so cluttered with fear, worry, and stress,\nthat we can’t focus on our goals. In my personal experience,\nliving a full life has nothing to do with the resources or\nopportunities you have.\nIt’s about knowing what you want, and also knowing how\nyou can get it. That’s why you need to be focused every\nday. Without work, no goal will ever be achieved. That’s why\nI want to share one ancient habit that stood the test of time.\nThis habit has proved itself over and over again.\nThe Power Of Having A Mantra\nI’m not a spiritual person. I believe in coincidence and luck. I\nalso don’t believe in some kind of spiritual energy that we\ncan’t see.\n\f\nI’m a pretty skeptical person. But I’m also a pragmatist. I\nbelieve in what works. That’s why I never challenge religion\nor spirituality because it works for millions of people.\nIn fact, I study religion, cultures, and diﬀerent beliefs that\npeople have. And one thing that I’ve learned from religion is\nhow useful a Mantra is.\nMost of us have heard about it, but few of us have one or,\nlet alone, actively practice it. What is a Mantra, anyway? A\ngood deﬁnition I found online is this:\n“A “mantra” is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a\nsyllable, word or phonemes, or group of words in Sanskrit\nbelieved by practitioners to have psychological and spiritual\npowers.”\nMantras exist (in some shape or form) for centuries. You can\nﬁnd them in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity.\nI’ve learned that people from all over the world use a\nMantra to overcome fear and improve their focus. It doesn’t\nmatter who came up with it ﬁrst. What matters is that it\nworks.\nMy favorite example of someone who applies it is\nFloyd Mayweather.\nYes. The boxer. Mayweather might be a controversial ﬁgure\nthat people either love or hate. But he’s also considered as\nthe best boxer of all time. Not one of the best. Thé best. He\nhas a record of 50–0. And he never even came close to\nlosing.\nHis recipe for success? A lot of talent, that’s for sure. But,\nthe man also has a crazy work ethic. And he’s been training\never since he was a baby.\nI’ve been following him for years. I don’t care about his cars\nor money. I watch his training videos to see whether I can\n\f\nlearn something that I can apply to my own life. A person\nwith those kinds of results must do things right. You can’t\ndeny that.\nA few years ago, I noticed something that seemed like a\npromotion technique at ﬁrst. Mayweather often repeated the\nsame phrase:\n“Hard work. Dedication.”\nIt sounds like a lame company slogan. He says that while he\nworks on the heavy bag, speedball, pads, and even while\nhe’s running. Constantly, he repeats the same words.\nSometimes in a diﬀerent order.\nAnd it wasn’t until I learned about Mayweather’s Mantra,\nthat I started using my own. I always thought it was\nsomething that yoga hipsters use to become “Zen.” Do you\nsee me sitting on the ﬂoor with crossed legs and saying:\n“Hmmmn. Hmmmn. Hmmmmn”?\n“Let’s go.”\nThat’s my mantra. I’ve trained myself to say it every\nmorning when I wake up. It really energizes me. I wake up\nand immediately say, “Let’s go.”\nI’ve experimented with diﬀerent Mantras. In particular, ones\nthat you repeat more often. But I’ve found that it’s not my\nthing. I’m a pretty direct and no B.S. person. I prefer\nsomething short and powerful. Not only do I say it when I\nwake up, I also say it before I start working. Or, when I want\nto start my workout. “Let’s go.”\nGive it a try. It works really well for me because it changes\nmy state of mind to action. Especially when I feel afraid or\npowerless in life, I try to force a change in state. You know\nthat platitude, “The only way out is through?” I believe"

    "raw_text": "that’s true. And if you want to get through things, you\nneed action.\nAfter you start using your Mantra, you get into a\nworry-free zone.\nThis is one of the most eﬀective things I’ve found in all of\npersonal growth. I highly recommend a Mantra for everyone.\nAll you need to do is pick a slogan that helps you to get\nfocused, and that changes your state. Give it a try now.\n“But I don’t believe it!”\nPessimists say: “Just saying three words won’t help you with\nreal problems.” To those people I say: What will help?\nDrowning in your own misery? Being paralyzed? Never\ntaking action? Complaining? Feeling bitter about life?\nNever. We all know that life’s too short to spend worrying\nabout things that will never happen. And if something\nbad does happen to you, do something about it.\n\f\nHow To Focus Better: Manage Your\nAttention (not your time)\nHow many minutes of undisturbed work do you get done on\nan average day? 10, 20, maybe 50 minutes? If you think\nthat sounds low, just examine your life. Most of us can’t go\nundisturbed for more than 10 minutes.\nWe’re all so connected that it becomes impossible to ﬁnd\ntime to focus on yourself and your work. Some of us get\nhundreds of notiﬁcations and messages per day. You ﬁnd\nyourself answering a Whatsapp message here, an email\nthere, talk to a friend, and then talk to a colleague on Slack.\nMost people’s days consist of answering to notiﬁcations. In a\nway, you’re held captive by others.\nSo no wonder that many of us ask: “How do I\nfocus better?”\nWhen new subscribers join my newsletter, I always ask\nthem about their challenges. And the majority who answers,\nmentions something that’s related to focus.\nIn fact, when I did a survey on my newsletter last year, 28%\nsaid that their biggest challenge is related to focus and time\nmanagement. Here are just two examples of what readers\nmentioned to me:\n“My number one challenge in life, and career, is\ntrying to stay focused on my tasks. My mind always\nstarts drifting to trivial things when I’m at work.”\n“My biggest challenge is: how can we deﬁne what\nto really focus on?”\nThese questions have been on my mind in the past too. And\nyou know what I found? Distractions are not some 21st-\ncentury ﬁrst world problems. Distractions have always been\n\f\na part of life. It has nothing to do with your smartphone or\nYouTube, online shopping, Instagram, or any other thing you\nwant to blame for your lack of focus. It’s human nature. We\nlove to be busy.\nSocrates, one of the founders of Western Philosophy,\nwarned us 2400 years ago:\n“Beware the barrenness of a busy life.”\nBusyness is not a good thing. Because busyness and\ndistractions go hand in hand. Want no distractions? Move to\nthe woods.But that’s not how life works. Plus, modern day\nlife is too good. Seneca, one of the most famous Stoic\nphilosophers, said this in Letters From A Stoic:\n“There is never a time when new distraction will not\nshow up.”\nThere are always distractions. So you better train yourself to\nmanage your attention. Not your time. Because that’s the\nbiggest mistake people make. We falsely believe that we\ncan manage time. But time can’t be managed. The only\nthing you control is your attention.\nAnd remember: Focus determines the quality of your life. No\nfocus means no control of your attention. And no control\nmeans frustration. We all know what frustration leads to.\nStart managing your attention. Not your time.\n\f\nPart II: Improving Productivity\n \n \n“It’s like a lot of things, said the smith. Do the least part of it\nwrong and ye’d just as well to do it all wrong.”\n \n- Cormac McCarthy"

    "raw_text": "Smartphones Harm Your\nProductivity More Than You Think\nBelieve me, that thing you’re using to read this article is not\nyour friend. And even if you’re reading this on your laptop of\nPC, there’s one thing I want to ask you: How important is\nyour device to you?\nI was shocked when I read a weird statistic a while back. An\nexperiment, which was conducted by the universities of\nWürzburg and Nottingham Trent, revealed that 37.4% of the\nparticipants rated their phone as more or equally important\nin relation to their close friends.\nWeirdoes. Seriously, what’s wrong with people? 29.4 percent\nof those weirdoes even said their smartphone was equally\nimportant, or more important, to them than their parents.\nOr is there something wrong with me? Am I just an old\nschool person who likes to read books all day and only has a\nfew close friends and family members that he actually\nvalues?\nLook, I’m not joking around. Smartphones are\ndangerous. Not because they may cause stress, anxiety,\nand even depression, but because they change your\nbehavior. It seems like we can’t focus on one thing for more\nthan 5 seconds. Why? Well, we can’t because our\nsmartphone is constantly going oﬀ.\nNot because people are calling you (it seems like people are\nafraid of calling these days, but that’s another topic), but\nbecause you’re constantly getting notiﬁcations about\nTHINGS THAT DON’T MATTER.\nChange Your Smartphone Behavior\n\f\nThe same study I mentioned above also found something\nelse:\n“Researchers asked participants to perform a concentration\ntest under four diﬀerent circumstances: with their\nsmartphone in their pocket, at their desk, locked in a drawer\nand removed from the room completely.”\nThe results are signiﬁcant — test results were lowest when\nthe smartphone was on the desk, but with every additional\nlayer of distance between participants and their\nsmartphones, test performance increased. Overall, test\nresults were 26% higher when phones were removed from\nthe room.”\nSure, it’s just a study. And you don’t have to believe\neverything you read. But this is something I can personally\nattest. For the past two years, I’ve signiﬁcantly changed my\nsmartphone behavior. Namely:\nI have turned oﬀ ALL my notiﬁcations except\nmessages and calls\nI’ve removed myself from all Whatsapp groups\nexcept for one with my closest friends\nI’ve removed all news apps (if something important\nhappens, you’ll hear it from the people around you)\nI only consume music, paid journalism, articles from\nspeciﬁc authors I follow, podcasts, YouTube videos\n(mostly to learn, but also for entertainment\nbecause I’m not a robot), books, and audiobooks on\nit\nFor the rest, I use my phone to call, text, and to\ntake notes, photos and videos\nAlso, I’ve stopped immediately responding to notiﬁcations.\nThat doesn’t mean I don’t value other people who try to\nreach me. It means that I refuse to be a slave to my phone. I\ncontrol my phone."

Obviously, they still do because the only way to\nescape those idiots is to cut yourself oﬀ and run to the\nwoods. That’s not realistic.\nI like my phone. But I don’t need it.\nThe results have been great since I started using my\nsmartphone in the above way. During the past two years, I\ngot more things done than ever.\nAnd, I still have time to work out daily, hang out with my\nfriends, have dinner with my family, and spend time with\nmy lady friend. You and I both have the same 24 hours at\nour disposal.\nThe diﬀerence maker is how you spend those 1440 minutes\neach day. To be honest, I think I still have much to improve\nabout my eﬀectiveness. No one reaches peak productivity.\nNor is it important to be the most productive person in the\nworld.\nHow you want to spend your time is your business. But\nplease don’t tell me you don’t want to be 26% more\nproductive by just changing one unimportant thing in your\nlife: Your smartphone behavior.\nAnd if you wonder why not more people telling you to get\nrid of that thing, realize that they are trying to get to your\nwallet. Also, social media people who claim that they run\ntheir business with their smartphone are doing the exact\nsame thing. They need you to consume their content, on\nyou guessed it, your smartphone.\nApple will also never tell us, “don’t mind buying the new\niPhone because it’s going to destroy your productivity.” Of\ncourse not, they try to tell you the opposite. And without a\ndoubt, smartphones also improve productivity.\n\f\nYou probably found my articles on your phone. Thar’s\nawesome. And, I also read a lot of articles and books on my\nphone. But you and I use the device to learn something,\nwhich is always a good thing.\nPeople who make phones and apps are smarter than us.\nTheir only goal is to get you hooked. I think it’s good to\nrealize that. That’s why I often try to remind myself not to\ndepend on smartphones too much because my attention\nmatters more than productivity.

    "raw_text": "How Perfectionism Is Destroying\nYour Productivity\nDo you always worry that you didn’t do a good job? Do you\nalways question your work and your actions? Are you afraid\nof admitting your mistakes? Does rejection make you feel\nlike shit?\nIf so, you’re in great danger. I’m not a perfectionist myself.\nAt least, that’s what I try to tell myself. I bet that you try to\ntell yourself that as well. In fact, the people who don’t admit\nit are the worst.\nBut here’s the thing: If you’re a perfectionist, you’re just a\nprocrastinator with a mask. It’s no diﬀerent from someone\nwho’s lazy and does nothing at all. Don’t believe me? Let’s\ntake a look. A perfectionist…\nAlways waits for the right moment.\nNever makes mistakes.\nAlways needs more time.\nBut at the end of the day, life and work are about outcomes.\nResults matter. And if you’re a perfectionist, you might get\nthe outcomes some day. But the question is: When? And, at\nwhat cost? Research speciﬁcally shows that perfectionism is\nclosely related to depression and low self-esteem.\n“Perfectionists are their own devils.” —Jack Kirby\nIs the price of perfectionism really worth it? I’ve found that\nperfectionism is just another form of procrastination. When\nyou constantly worry about making mistakes, doubt creeps\nin your mind. And that causes indecision. There are two\ntypes of perfectionists:\n\f\n1. The one that never starts. You want to achieve\nsomething, but you immediately start doubting\nyourself. You think: “I don’t think I can do it.” So you\nnever start.\n2. The one that starts but has too high\nstandards. You set a goal. You work hard (maybe\ntoo hard). But you’ve set your goals so high, that\nyou’re always failing yourself.\nBoth scenarios can cause the following: Anxiety, worry,\ndepression, and Type A behavior.\nThese are things that we rather avoid. Joachim Stöber and\nJutta Joormann, who studied Worry, Procrastination, and\nPerfectionism, write:\n“The combination of concern over mistakes and\nprocrastination may be a crucial factor in the maintenance\nof worry. On the one hand, it may prolong existing threats\nbecause no steps are taken to cope. On the other hand, it\nmay increase existing threats or even produce additional\nthreats because initially solvable problems will pile up, thus\ncreating an overload of problems that may ﬁnally be\ninsoluble.”\nAnd that feeling of being helpless is the biggest pitfall for\nus. Because what do we do when we feel helpless? Exactly\n—we give up. Just look at the studies about Learned\nHelplessness.\nHowever, perfectionism is not always bad. In fact, some\nstudies suggest perfectionism is related to greater\nachievement. But that’s not the question here.\nOf course, when you set higher goals and if you have higher\nstandards; you achieve more. Without a doubt,\nperfectionistic tendencies can be a good thing. But as we all"

    "raw_text": "know, achieving goals is not the only thing in life. It’s more\nabout HOW we reach our goals and aspirations.\n“How can we beat the nasty side of procrastination\nand perfectionism?”\nSo we’ve talked about how procrastination and\nperfectionism are related, and why it can be bad. But what’s\nthe solution? I’ve found an interesting study by Gordon L.\nFlett and his colleagues; they talk about the role of learned\nresourcefulness to perfectionism. They suggest that learned\nresourcefulness can play a mediator role. So I started\nlooking into learned resourcefulness. And this is what I’ve\nfound from an article by Michael Rosenbaum:\n“Learned resourcefulness refers to the behavioral repertoire\nnecessary for both regressive self-control and reformative\nself-control. This repertoire includes self-regulating one’s\nemotional and cognitive responses during stressful\nsituations, using problem-solving skills, and delaying\nimmediate gratiﬁcation for the sake of more meaningful\nrewards in the future.”\nLearned resourcefulness is the skill that you need to stop\nsabotaging yourself.\nFinding a balance.\nLet’s look at the opposite of a perfectionist: A slacker.\nIf you’re a slacker, you don’t care about much. Good\nenough is your motto. And you have no ambition at all. An\nattitude like that doesn’t bring you anywhere. The American\nnovelist Cormac McCarthy put it best:\n\f\n“It’s like a lot of things, said the smith. Do the least part of it\nwrong and ye’d just as well to do it all wrong.”\nSlacking is an attitude of “I don’t care.” But if you want to\nmake things happen in your life, you have to care. And what\nyou want is to ﬁnd a middle ground where your\nperfectionistic tendencies drive you, but you have the calm\nof a slacker, and you combine that with learned\nresourcefulness. So that’s why I found a balance between\nperfectionism and slacking. It looks like this:\nDo great work like a perfectionist, but don’t give too much\nattention to your goals like a slacker. And ﬁnally, combine it\nwith this:\nResourcefulness — Goals can work well, but they\ncan also be counterproductive. That’s why you want\nto rely on systems. And when shit hits the fan; use\nyour problem-solving skills to ﬁgure things out.\nTo me, that’s the sweet spot: Instead of beating yourself up\nwhen you make a mistake or if you fail yourself, you just\nadjust or solve the problem.\nAvoid the perfectionist’s favorite sentence: “OMG,\nthis is the worst thing ever!”\nAlso avoid the slacker’s favorite sentence: “I don’t\ncare.”\n\f\nBut instead, you say: “I’ve got this.”\nSo what’s your current challenge? Actually, I don’t even\nhave to ask: You’ve got this."

    "raw_text": "How To Read 100 Books A Year\nDoes your reading list keep growing? Did you buy books that\nyou’ve never read? It might be time to cross more books\nfrom your list this year than ever.\nIf you’re reading less than you want, you’re not the only\none. One year ago I looked at my Goodreads page and\nnoticed that I had read only ﬁve books in 2014. That\nrealization frustrated me.\nI love books, but since I graduated college in 2011, I’d been\nreading fewer books every single year. My work and life got\nin the way of reading as much as I wanted. Why read 100\nbooks in a year? You read because you want to learn from\nother people’s experience. Otto von Bismarck put it best:\n“Fools learn from experience. I prefer to learn from the\nexperience of others.”\nIf you want to get anywhere in this world, you need to\neducate yourself, and to educate yourself you need to read\n—a lot. Here’s how to do it.\n1. Buy In Bulk\nIt costs money to buy books, and it costs you time to read\nthem — I’m assuming you have both if you’re reading this.\nEveryone can make time. And if you don’t have money, ﬁnd\na way to make or save money. As Dutch Renaissance man\nErasmus once said:\n“When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have any\nleft, I buy food and clothes.”\nBe assured, the money and time you spend on books are\nworth it. I can’t think of a better investment. Books are only\na waste of money if you don’t read them.\n\f\nIf you want to read more, you have to buy more books.\nSome people don’t get it. They spend $200 on new shoes,\nbut they ﬁnd it ridiculous to buy 20 books from Amazon.\nThe idea is simple: If you have more books in your house,\nyou’ll have more choices, and this will help you read more.\nHere’s why: Most of the books you read are not planned in\nadvance. You don’t sit down in January and say: “The ﬁrst\nweek of June I’ll read this book.”\nYou ﬁnish a book, look you at your inventory, and decide\nwhat to read next. Don’t overthink which book you should\nread next—you’ll end up reading reviews for hours, which is\na waste of time.\nFor example, most people who want to start with Stoicism\nask me: “Which one should I read ﬁrst—Seneca, Marcus\nAurelius or Epictetus?” Buy them all. Read them all.\nHaving an inventory of books keeps up the momentum. You\nalso never have an excuse not to read.\n2. A(always) B(e) R(eading)\nYou might have heard of the term ‘ABC’ from the play/movie\nGlengarry Glen Ross: Always Be Closing. Many salespeople\nand entrepreneurs live by that motto.\nI live by a diﬀerent motto: Always Be Reading. I read a\nminimum of 1 hour per day on weekdays and even more\nduring the weekend and holidays.\nFind a way to read around your schedule and your life\nsituation. Don’t make excuses like you’re tired or too busy.\nAlways Be Reading means that you:\nRead on the train\nRead while you’re breastfeeding your baby\nRead while you’re eating\nRead at the doctor’s oﬃce\nRead at work\n\f\nAnd most importantly — read while everyone else is\nwasting their time watching the news or checking\nFacebook for the 113th time that day.\nIf you do that, you’ll read more than 100 books in a year.\nHere’s how. Most people read 50 pages an hour. If you read\n10 hours a week, you’ll read 26,000 pages a year. Let’s say\nthe average book you read is 250 pages: In this scenario,\nyou’ll read 104 books in a year.\nWith that pace—even if you take a two-week break—you’ll\nread at least 100 books in a year. That’s a good return on\nyour time investment. What’s the ROI of reading the news? I\ndon’t know exactly, but it must be negative.\n3. Read Relevant Books Only\nHave you ever read a book that’s supposedly amazing and\nyou don’t get it? I wouldn’t go as far as saying that any book\nsucks because people spend a lot of time writing and editing\na book.\nBut not all books are for everyone. A book might be a best-\nseller, but maybe you can’t stand the writing. Or maybe it’s\nnot the right time to read a book. In any case: If you can’t\nﬂip through the pages, put the book away and pick up\nsomething you are so excited about that you tear up the\npages.\nRead books that are close to what’s going on in your life.\nThere’s a book for everything you can think oﬀ. People are\nwriting books for 2000 years, and there have been plenty of\npeople in your shoes: struggling teen, aspiring artist, broke\nentrepreneur, new parent, etc. Don’t waste your time\nreading about subjects you have zero interest in.\nInstead, pick out the books that are related to your\nprofession or hobby. Read books about people that you\n\f\nadmire. Don’t read a book just because it’s a best-seller or a\nclassic if it has no meaning to you.\n4. Read Multiple Books Simultaneously\nThere are no rules to reading so you can do whatever you\nwant. At times, I’m reading 5 books at once. I might read 50\npages of one book in the morning and then read another\nbook in the afternoon.\nThat’s how I prefer it. Others like to read a book cover to\ncover and only then read something new.\nIf you’re reading something that’s complicated, you might\nwant to read something that’s easier for the evenings. I like\nto read biographies before I go to sleep because they are\nlike stories. Fiction also works well in the evening.\nI don’t want to read a book about investing in bed with a\nhighlighter and a pen. If I do that, I will be awake until 3 AM\nbecause my mind is buzzing with the new things I’m\nlearning.\n5. Retain The Knowledge\nKnowledge is only good if you use it. To retain knowledge,\nyou need a system that helps you do that. This is how I do\nit:\nWhen you read a book, use a pen to make notes in\nthe margins and highlight important text. If you’re\nreading digitally, be aware of over-highlighting. Just\nbecause it’s so easy you shouldn’t highlight\neverything you ﬁnd slightly interesting. Keep the\nhighlighting for ‘aha’ things only.\nIf you read something you want to deﬁnitely\nremember, fold the top or bottom corner of the\npage. For digital readers: take a picture and store it\nin a notetaking app you prefer.\nWhen you ﬁnish the book, go back to the pages\nwith the folds and skim your notes.\n\f\nWrite down (use your notetaking software or\nphysical notebook) in your own words what the\nbook is about and what advice the author is giving.\nCopy the quotes that stand out the most to you.\nThe point is not to copy the book but to help you process\nthe information so you can use it later.\nRead as much as you possibly can — but never forget to\napply what you’ve learned because that is what counts the\nmost. You put in many hours to read books, make sure you\nget something out of it."

    "raw_text": "Take A Vacation: It Boosts Your\nProductivity And Reduces Stress\nYou recharge your phone when it runs out of juice. You reﬁll\nyour gas tank when you’re running on empty.\nBut sometimes, you forget to do the same for your most\nprecious possession: Your body (and the brain that’s inside\nof it). Whether you love what you do, are in between jobs, or\nhave a job you hate: You’re working. ‘Living’ is also a job. A\npretty tough one, actually.\nJust the act of getting up in the morning can be a daunting\ntask. And I’m not even talking about all the responsibilities\nwe have. So, why do you make your life even more\nchallenging by not taking a vacation to recharge? I’m not\ntalking about your weekends that are packed with activities,\nor holidays where you work more than relax.\nNo, that type of “free time” doesn’t serve a purpose. I’m\ntalking about resting with a very speciﬁc reason: To\nrecharge your battery so you can keep working hard. To\nme, life is about working hard. Voltaire said it best:\n“The further I advance in age, the more I ﬁnd work\nnecessary. It becomes in the long run the greatest of\npleasures, and takes the place of the illusions of life.”\nRest reduces stress. Improves creativity and\nproductivity.\nScientiﬁc research shows that a vacation decreases\nperceived job stress and burnout. Now, that’s a pretty solid\nbeneﬁt of taking a few days oﬀ. But there’s more. As you\nmay know, I’m always interested in productivity. In the case\nof resting or a vacation, my question is:\n\f\nWill I get more things done when I get back? The answer is\nyes, but there’s one major thing to keep in mind.\nBut let’s back up a bit: What does it mean to get more\ndone? Getting things done has nothing to do with time—if\nyou work more hours, you don’t necessarily get more done.\nIn fact, research shows that working more hours general\nmeans less productivity. Why? Well, we often waste time if\nwe have more of it. It’s simple: If I say to you, you have a\nyear to write an article. What would you do? Procrastinate,\nright?\nBut what if I tell you that you only have 2 hours? You\nimmediately think, how can I write this article ASAP! So in a\nway, having more days oﬀ, and fewer days to work, forces\nyou to be more eﬀective with your time. Research\nshows that a vacation in itself won’t make you more\nproductive, but when you have more days oﬀ, you have a\nstrong desire to get more things done in less time.\nAnd that’s a win-win situation for everybody: You, your\nbusiness, or your job. You take oﬀ a few days, recharge,\nspend time with your family or friends, and when you come\nback, you’re more productive. Sounds great. But wait,\nthere’s a caveat. When your vacation is stressful, the\npositive beneﬁts go away. Have you ever watched National\nLampoon’s Vacation with Chevy Chase? That’s how my\nfamily holidays were. Not good.\nSo keep the stress at a minimum on your holiday. Otherwise,\nyou’ve wasted a perfect opportunity to relax and boost your\noverall productivity. Here are a few tips that might help.\n1. If You’re A Planner, PLAN\nOne of my friends loves to plan everything. He loves\nitineraries and minute by minute plans of the day when he\nis on vacation. I’m the opposite.\n\f\nWhen we went on a trip a few years back, he said, “I’m\ngoing copy your style and just go with the ﬂow.” I said,\n“perfect.”\nOn the ﬁrst morning, I slept until 10AM. It turned out he\nwoke up early, got nervous because he didn’t have a\nschedule, and spent the whole morning creating one.\nDon’t try to be someone you’re not. If you like to plan your\nholiday, just do it. But try to stay ﬂexible: You’re on holiday.\n2. Make A Daily Movie\nIt’s creative, and it’s a great memory for later. Plus, focusing\non the act of ﬁlming will force your attention on something\nspeciﬁc. In that way, you will be more in the moment, and\nyou’ll worry less about stuﬀ back home.\nJust don’t ﬁlm ALL day. Otherwise, you won’t be present at\nall.\nAll you need is a smartphone. Just ﬁlm stuﬀ with your phone\nand edit it right on your phone. If you’re more into video,\nbring a proper camera and a laptop.\n3. Read A LOT\nBill Gates is famous for his voracious reading habit. He is\nalso known for his ‘Think Week’ where does nothing else but\nread and think.\nRecently, he published an article with 5 books that he’s\nreading this summer. Take a look if you’re looking for some\ninspiration.\nI like to read for hours on my holidays. Reading slows down\ntime, makes you think, and is good for your brain.\n4. Get Bored\nOne of my favorite strategies for ﬁnding new ideas is to get\nbored out of my mind. It sounds easier than it is because of\ndistractions.\n\f\nIn the past, I would do everything NOT to get bored: Watch\nTV, go out, browse Facebook, etc. But did you know that you\ncan use boredom to your advantage?\nInstead of giving into distractions, just give into the\nboredom and see it leads your mind to. In fact, one of my\nfavorite artists of all time, Andy Warhol, embraced boredom.\nYou can tell by the boring ﬁlms he made or the references\nhe made in The Philosophy Of Andy Warhol about getting\nbored.\nWhenever I hit a creative wall, I just do nothing. Literally,\nnothing. Try it sometime. It’s a great strategy; maybe you\ncome up with the next best thing in your industry.\nIt’s never a good time to take a break.\n“I just need to ﬁnish this project.”\n“My boss will never accept it.”\n“People will think I’m lazy.”\n“I don’t have time.”\n“Money never sleeps.”\nYeah, yeah, I’ve been there too. But what would you rather:\nContinue to work without resting and burn out? Or take\nsome rest before you’re tired? Yup, life is long — so play the\nlong game. On that note, I might not be tired yet, but it’s\ntime for me to take a break. So I will see you again when I\ncome back on August 1 with a new article. Until then — take\nit easy, because I deﬁnitely will.\nP.s. For years I couldn’t aﬀord to go on a holiday. If you’re in\nthe same position, have a staycation. The above tips still\napply."

    "raw_text": "Eliminate Mindless Browsing\nWe all have days we feel unproductive or that we did not do\nanything. When you feel you are not productive, the\nchances are that it is because interruptions and multitasking\ndrain your energy.\nWhen you juggle multiple things simultaneously, like;\nsending an email, text a friend and checking your Facebook\nwhile you are in a meeting, you engage in context\nswitching. In a research done by Gloria Mark of the\nUniversity of California, Irvine, it showed that it takes an\naverage of 25 minutes to return to the original task after an\ninterruption. Since we are interrupted more than once, this\nadds up quickly, and before you know it, you feel like you\nhave done nothing that day.\nCliﬀord Nass, a sociologist from Stanford University, has\nresearched the impact of multitasking and found that\npeople who engage in multitasking are “suckers for\nirrelevancy.” We engage in multitasking because we are\ndistracted by notiﬁcations, which are addictive.\nWe cannot control ourselves; we must look at the\nnotiﬁcation to see who or what wants our attention. Every\ntime a notiﬁcation pops up on our screen, we get a rush that\nreleases dopamine.\nDopamine is one of the body’s happy chemicals; it controls\nthe “pleasure” systems of the brain and makes you feel joy.\nThis joyous feeling is addictive and makes us seek out\nbehaviors that stimulate dopamine. You can think about\nfood, sex, drugs and the notiﬁcations you receive on your\nscreen.\n\f\nWhile dopamine may cause a rush, it also exhausts us. That\nis why you still feel tired at the end of the day while you\nhave not been productive. This is a harmful process, and we\nneed to stop this pattern.\nThe Fix: Eliminate Browsing\nBeing productive can be as simple as taking control over\nyour day. What harms your productivity the most is\nbrowsing. It absolutely kills it. We’ve all experienced a\ndistortion in time when we are browsing. “What?! I just did\nNOTHING for 2 hours.” Yes, we even do this at work. Take\ncontrol of your attention and time. The point is; do\nsomething that’s worth your time. Be conscious about your\ntime. And spend so it improves the quality of your life."

    "raw_text": "20 Things That Will Make You\nMore Productive Than Ever\nThe last three years have been huge for me. I’ve got more\nthings done than ever, moved countries, bought an\napartment and a small oﬃce building, spent loads of time\nwith my family and friends, kept a healthy lifestyle, and\nexercised at least 4 times a week.\nMany variables determine your overall productivity. Tools,\napps, or hacks, don’t work if you lack the right\nmindset because productivity is a way of living. It’s about\nachieving maximum output, getting shit done, and not\nwasting time. I think that output and happiness go hand in\nhand. To me, doing nothing equals misery.\nI want to share 20 things I’ve done in the past three years\nthat have made me more productive than ever (in no\nparticular order).\n1. Always Cut To The Chase\nWith everything in life, there’s a bunch of crap, and\nthere’s stuﬀ that matters. Chit chat, small talk,\ndelaying, waiting around, not speaking up, is all\nuseless. If you want to get shit done, you have to\njump straight into the action.\n2. Record All Your Thoughts And Ideas\nSimilar to computers, we have a Random Access\nMemory (RAM). Your human RAM stores relevant\nshort-term information. But your RAM capacity is\nlimited. When it’s full, older information that you\nhave stored will be deleted to make room for new\ninformation. You want to write down your thoughts to\nunload your RAM, which gives you more brainpower.\n\f\nEven if you never take a look at that note again, it’s\nstill worth it.\n3. Say No\nWhen it comes to work, I say no to everything that\ndoesn’t support my goals and values. We live in an\nabundant world — there are always enough\nopportunities. In my personal life, I say no to\neverything that doesn’t thrill me. When I think ‘meh’\nabout something, I always say NO. That eliminates\nwasting time on shit that I’m not excited about.\n4. Take A 5 Minute Break Every 30 To 45 Minutes\nYou can stretch your back, walk around, drink some\nwater. But more importantly, you take your nose out\nof your work. When you come back to your desk, you\nmight have new ideas. Or, you might think: “WHAT\nAM I DOING?” And stop it before you waste all your\ntime.\n5. Eliminate Everything That Distracts You\nWillpower is overrated. If something distracts you,\neliminate it. One of my friends has a news addiction.\nI suggested to get rid of his tv, delete his news apps,\nand block the news sites on his laptop. Two weeks\nlater he told me that he’s ﬁnally starting a business.\nDon’t think you’re immune to your\ndistractions. Remove them.\n6. Keep Away Clutter\nA cluttered life means a cluttered brain. And with a\ncluttered brain, you can’t get stuﬀ done. I prefer a\nsimple work and living environment. A desk, a\nlaptop, and a notebook. Keep it simple. You don’t\nneed any ﬂuﬀ.\n7. Focus On 1 Thing Some Days\nIf you have recurring tasks, try to do as much of the\n\f\nsame thing on one day. I write 2–3 blog posts on 1\nday, the other days of the week I use for my other\nprojects and businesses. On my writing days, I turn\noﬀ my phone and just write. Nothing else gets in the\nway.\n8. Stop Consuming So Much Information\nYou don’t need to read 5000 articles on productivity.\nIf you ﬁnd useful information, try it. Don’t search for\nmore. More is not always better. You can only\nprocess so much of it. Stop consuming, start\ncreating.\n9. Create Routines\nDecisions fatigue your brain. And routines eliminate\ndecisions. Which ultimately means more brainpower.\nRoutines are not OCD — they are eﬃcient. Use them.\n10.   Don’t Multitask\nWhen you juggle multiple things simultaneously,\nlike; sending an email, texting a friend and checking\nyour Facebook while you are in a meeting, you\nengage in context switching. In a research done by\nGloria Mark of the University of California, Irvine, it\nshowed that it takes an average of 25 minutes to\nreturn to the original task after an interruption.\nThat’s a waste of useful time.\n11.   Check Email Twice A Day\nEvery time you check your email, you get a rush of\ndopamine. I get it — checking email feels nice, and\nmost of us are addicted. While dopamine may cause\na rush, it also exhausts you. That is why you still feel\ntired at the end of the day while you have not been\nproductive. To minimize that, turn oﬀ notiﬁcations,\nand check your email only twice a day on set times.\n\f\n12.   No Smartphone During The First Hour Of Your\nDay\nA smartphone’s primary function is to interrupt you.\nBut don’t let other people or apps interrupt you\nduring the ﬁrst hour of your day. Take that ﬁrst hour\nto think about the day ahead of you, read a book,\nenjoy your breakfast, coﬀee or tea.\n13.   Plan The Next Day \nEvery night before I go to bed, I take 5 minutes to\nset my priorities (usually 3–4) for the next day. That\nmakes me more focused when I wake up. I ﬁnd that I\nwaste time if I don’t do this practice. It’s cool to ‘go\nwith the ﬂow.’ The only problem is: I don’t want to be\na dog that mindlessly chases cars.\n14.   Keep ‘Thinking’ To A Minimum\nWhen people say: “I’m thinking.” They mean\nworrying by thinking. Don’t think too much. Just DO,\nand see what happens. If you like what you’re\nseeing, continue. If not, do something else.\n15.   Exercise \nA few things are vital in life: Food, water, shelter,\nrelationships, and exercise. Without this stuﬀ you\ncan’t function properly. Scientiﬁc research shows\nthat regular exercise can make you happier, smarter,\nand more energetic.\n16.   Laugh A Little\nLaughing reduces stress. And if you want to keep up\nyour productivity, you don’t want stress. So move\nthe corners of your mouth upward as much as you\ncan.\n17.   Don’t Go To Meetings\nThis is a tough one for people who work for\ncorporations. Some companies have a ‘Meeting’"

    "raw_text": "culture. People organize meetings just to look\nimportant or procrastinate real work. For goodness\nsake, PLEASE STOP.\n18.   Is That Really Necessary?\nAsk yourself that question as often as you can. You\nwill ﬁnd that your answer is often: Nope. So why do\nunnecessary things?\n19.   If You’re Having A Shitty Day, Press Reset\nYou might screw, maybe someone gets angry with\nyou—shit happens. Don’t get down about it. Take\nsome time alone, meditate, listen to music, or go for\na walk. Try to get back on track — don’t let your day\ngo to waste\n20.   Do The Work\nYes, talking about work is easier than doing it.\nEveryone can do it. But you’re not everyone, right?\nYou’re a productivity beast. So act like one.\nWithout these 20 things, I wouldn’t be productive at all. You\nmay have noticed that I don’t get into details, like which\ntools and apps I use. I don’t think that stuﬀ matters. It’s\nabout creating a productivity mindset and environment that\nlets you thrive. I only care about getting things done in a fun\nand not stressful way. That makes doing work way more fun\nand rewarding.\n\f\nHere’s Why Time Off Work\nActually IMPROVES Your Work\nand Life\nWhat do you do when you feel tired or overwhelmed? Do\nyou power through? Or do you take some time oﬀ? In the\npast, I thought that you should always power through — no\nmatter what. Now, I still think that way when it comes to life\nin general. You can’t quit taking care of yourself and your\nfamily.\nA sense of responsibility is one of the most powerful\nmotivators in life. But I’m not talking about a lack of\nmotivation here. I’m talking about taking time oﬀ work. But\nthere’s still a massive taboo on taking time oﬀ. Some people\nthink it’s for losers. Others think it’s about escaping your\nwork.\nAfter all, “If you love your work and life, why do you even\nneed a break?” Good point, smart ass. Here’s why time oﬀ\nactually IMPROVES your work and life.\nLeonard Mlodinow, a physicist, who also co-authored two\nbooks with Stephen Hawking, recently shared scientiﬁc\nresearch in his book Elastic about taking time oﬀ. He\ndemonstrates that taking time oﬀ work improves our well-\nbeing:\n“Though some may consider “doing nothing” unproductive,\na lack of downtime is bad for our well-being, because idle\ntime allows our default network to make sense of what\nwe’ve recently experienced or learned.”\nPeople who never take time oﬀ to do nothing are short-term\nfocused. “I want to reach my goals! NOW!”\n\f\nBut as always, short-term thinking harms your long-term\ndevelopment and growth. What happens when you power\nthrough work and burn yourself out? In most instances, your\nresults suﬀer, and you become less productive. In some\ncases, you even become depressed — which will set you\nback even longer.\nPrevent Rather Than Cure\nIt’s one of the biggest clichés in the book. But how often do\nwe really prevent things? Instead, we put our head down\nand, “deal with it later.” Bad strategy. Instead, it’s much\nbetter to prevent burn-out or a decrease in your overall\nwork performance.\nDale Carnegie, a self-help pioneer, and author of How to\nStop Worrying and Start Living, said it best:\n“So, to prevent fatigue and worry, the ﬁrst rule is: Rest\noften. Rest before you get tired.”\nSo take time oﬀ work strategically throughout the year.\nThat’s what I just did too, and I experienced 5 beneﬁts as a\nconsequence:\n1. You Can Check Whether You Did The Right Things\nAt work, I know two modes:\n1. Execution\n2. Thinking\nWhen you are in execution mode, you can work for hours,\ndays or months in a row. In fact, I know people who’ve been\nin execution mode for years. They never took time oﬀ to\nreﬂect or think about their work. Result? A midlife crisis. Or,\nyoung folks who experience a quarter-life crisis.\nThat’s what you get when you put your head down and\nexecute without thinking. You might get results. But are\nthose results what you WANT? When you take time oﬀ work,\n\f\nyou have more inner-conversations. But when you execute,\nyou don’t. That’s one of the most important beneﬁts of\ndoing nothing. Sure, you might fall behind on work. But who\ncares? Would you rather go through your career with tunnel\nvision?\nI need at least ten days oﬀ to reﬂect seriously. For the ﬁrst\nﬁve days, I’m still somewhere between execution and\nthinking mode. It’s hard to switch to thinking and doing\nnothing if you’re used to doing work. But I always learn new\nthings about myself after a more extended break. I tend to\nread a lot. Over the past two weeks, I’ve read ﬁve books.\nBut I didn’t write at all. Also, I journaled very little.\nJust some reading, watching movies, documentaries,\nhanging out with friends, talking, daydreaming. That kind of\nstuﬀ. Neither does it cost much. But the return is enormous.\nNow, I feel better, have more energy, and I’m excited to get\nback to work. That’s also the next lesson I learned.\n2. You Get To Process Your Ideas\nYour brain does a lot of things you’re not aware of. One thing\nthat happens unconsciously is the processing of ideas by\nour brain.\nWe’ve all had ideas that never materialized, right? How\nmany people have you met who claimed to have had the\nidea for Facebook, Instagram, or any other type of new\nthing? I once met a guy who claimed to have come up with\nthe idea of making e-bikes. Did he do something with it? No.\nHe now buys garbage on Alibaba and sells it to businesses,\ndoor-to-door.\nWe all have ideas. Not only business ideas.\n“I want to redecorate the house.”\n“I want to drive from NYC to LA.”\n“I want to write a book.”\n\f\nAll those ideas are great. But what are you going to do with\nthem? I’m not even talking about execution. All ideas\nrequire processing. Are the ideas any good? Do I really want\nto do those things? Again, that’s a thinking process. When\nyou go from idea to execution, without processing, you often\nwaste your time in hindsight. Of course, you can never\nentirely prevent that. But by taking the time to process your\nideas, you can prevent your future self a lot of pain, worry,\nand even money.\n3. You Can Consume More Art\nWhat is art? Anything that makes you think. A good song,\nmovie, painting, book, poem, article, picture, sculpture, you\nname it. Anything can be art. There’s no authority that\ndeclares what art is and what is not.\nI get a lot of my inspiration from art. I can’t imagine what\nlife would be without it. Well, there is art on that too. Just\nread Fahrenheit 451 or watch the movie Equilibrium. The\nbest thing about art is that it improves your mood. And\nwhen you’re in a good mood, you’re happier. Just don’t\nconsume useless junk. Start with the classics. Listen to Bob\nDylan, Marvin Gaye, Whitney Houston. Watch movies by\nAlfred Hitchcock, Francis Ford Coppola. Read Ernest\nHemingway, Harper Lee, Ralph Ellison. Go to the British\nMuseum. Study Andy Warhol.\nLike millions of other people, you’ll be inspired by their\nwork. And that will enrich your life.\n4. You Can Focus On Other Important Things (that are\nnot work related)\n“Can you tell me more about yourself?”\nWhat do you think of when I ask you that question? Most of\nus start by saying something like, “I’m an accountant at"

You are your\nfamily, friends, hobby’s, passion, and then ﬁnally, you also\nhave a job. And yes, work is important. But so are the other\nthings.\nSo never neglect the other important things in your life.\nCultivate the relationships you have with your family and\nclose friends. Do things together. Go on a family holiday. Go\nmountain biking with your friends. Show some initiative. If\nno one in your family or group of friends takes action, why\naren’t YOU? By investing time in your relationships, you\nform group memories. That will only strengthen your\nrelationships.\nBut also focus on yourself. What are your hobbies? What’s\nsomething you want to learn more about? What did you\ndream of doing? Do those things.\n5. Resting Gets Boring. Quick.\nThere’s a reason humans work. We’re built to make things. I\nbelieve that the purpose of life is to be useful.\nMaking yourself useful ultimately leads to a meaningful life\nthat satisﬁes all your human needs. That’s why too much\nrest will make us restless. My mother always told me that\ntoo much of a good thing becomes a bad thing. She told me\nthat when I wanted to hang out with my friends all the time\nand when I had my ﬁrst girlfriend.\nIt’s true. Too much rest, like work, is not good. Our bodies\nand minds are made to use. Hence, the ﬁnal lesson I learned\nfrom doing nothing is this: After rest comes work. And what\ncomes after work? If you answered “more work,” you didn’t\nget the point. You probably need some rest.\n\f\nTime Blocking: Improve Your\nFocus And Get More Meaningful\nWork Done\nDo you have a list of priorities or goals that you want to\nachieve this year? And do you struggle with allocating time\nto them?\nI’m no diﬀerent. Life can be messy. Most of us juggle a lot of\ndiﬀerent things at the same time. Even though the simple\nsolution is to stop juggling, it’s not always realistic. Or even\nneeded.\nWhat if you could do more things without losing your time?\nIt’s possible. But you must work in an organized way.\nEnter: Time Blocking a simple productivity exercise that\nmany people use. It’s not fancy or revolutionary. The only\nthing you need is a calendar, which is something everyone\nwith a smartphone and computer has.\nTime Blocking is simply using your calendar to block time\nfor your most important priorities. During that time, you\nonly work on that one thing. And, you let your calendar lead\nthe way. That way, you don’t have to think, “What should I\ndo next?”\nBut Time Blocking is more than just a productivity tool. It’s\nabout self-awareness.\nThe road to high productivity starts with awareness.\nFor instance, one of my priorities this year is to write a book\non pragmatic thinking. However, there’s a problem: I\nhaven’t been writing.\nHow did I come to this conclusion? I simply looked at my list\nof priorities for 2017, and I then I looked at my calendar.\n\f\nI hadn’t scheduled any time for writing in a while. Now, you\nmight think, “do you really have to look at your calendar to\nrealize that?”\nYes, I do. I’m not some kind of supercomputer that\nremembers everything. I’m a regular human being. I think of\nsomething to do, start working on it, life gets in the way,\nand then I FORGET about it.\nIt happens to all of us. We need self-awareness and tools\nthat keep us in check. And that’s why I like Time Blocking.\nSome people love Time Blocking. Some people\nhate it.\nComputer science professor and author of Deep Work, Cal\nNewport, also uses time blocking. He says:\n“I take time blocking seriously, dedicating ten to twenty\nminutes every evening to building my schedule for the next\nday. During this planning process I consult my task lists and\ncalendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning\nnotes. My goal is to make sure progress is being made on\nthe right things at the right pace for the relevant deadlines.”\nThe last sentence is exactly why I schedule everything I\nwant to do. Working is not the same thing as making\nprogress. And Time Blocking helps me to improve my focus\nso I can get meaningful things done. Things that have an\nactual impact on my life.\nI know there are a lot of successful people who work with\nempty calendars. I’ve read the articles. They simply work\ntwo, three or four hours per day.\nAnd to be honest, that sounds very attractive to me too.\nHowever, one must look at his/her own life situation. What\nare you trying to achieve? And more importantly: What\nresources do you have? Often, people who don’t have a lot\n\f\nof money, do have a lot of time. So why not use it wisely?\nEither way, I think that planning serves a purpose.\nI plan my days and weeks in advance because I want to\nmake sure I’m working on the RIGHT things. Too often, I get\nlost in completing daily tasks. Think about it this way. I’m\npretty organized already. And I only work on one big thing\nper area of my life. But there are many diﬀerent areas of my\nlife: My family business, my blog, podcast, online courses,\nrelationship, friends, investments, etc.\nIt might sound like I’m doing many diﬀerent things. But it\ndepends on how you look at it. Everything I do leads to one\nthing: Living a meaningful and independent life.\nBut let’s not get philosophical here. If you’re lacking focus,\nnot making progress, and want to work in a more organized\nway, give time blocking a try. Here are some things I’ve\nlearned that may help:\nTake 10 minutes every evening and plan your next\nday. Rearrange blocks if you must create time for\nother important things.\nUse recurring blocks for recurring tasks. For\ninstance, I’ve scheduled two hours to write my new\nbook every Tuesday and Thursday.\nDon’t over-schedule. Realistically, you can’t be\nproductive 10 hours straight. Give yourself some\ntime between tasks.\nAnd always schedule more time than you think you\nneed.\n“Wow, that sounds like too much planning to me.”\nNo problem. Plan less. There’s always a counter-movement\nfor everything. People who do the exact opposite and\nadvocate an anti-productivity lifestyle. You know, folks who\nclaim they have empty calendars don’t care about anything\nin life.\n\f\nPeople who pretend they are always “enjoying” themselves.\nThey like to go with the ﬂow and daydream. You know what\nthat reminds me of? Those kids in school who always said,\n“Ah dude, I didn’t have time to study for this class,” but\nalways ended up getting straight A’s. People just want to\nmake you believe they don’t work hard. It’s a facade. And\nwhen they do well in life, it seems like it came easy.\nAs far as I know, achieving meaningful things is hard. I don’t\nthink there’s anything cool about pretending it’s easy. Nor\ndo I believe that it’s cool to work yourself to death.\nI often think of this question: Are you an amateur or\na pro?\nIt’s Steven Pressﬁeld’s famous analogy, from his book The\nWar Of Art, for getting work done. The amateur only works\nwhen inspiration strikes. The pro sits down every day and\nputs in steady work. The key is steady. Not irregular or\nextreme."

    "raw_text": "I Stopped Working Out Daily.\nHere’s What Happened.\nFor the past three years, I’ve been setting a yearly focus for\nmy life. In 2014, I wanted to work abroad and travel as\nmuch as I could. In 2015, I wanted to read more than 100\nbooks in a year. And in 2016, I wanted to work out every day\nof the year.\nI’ve done those things. I love setting a yearly focus because\nit gives you a clear idea of what you want to do with your\ntime. You’ll be surprised what you can do in a year if you put\nyour mind to it.\nThis year, my focus is to write more books (even though it’s\nnot going great, I’m still working on that). But at the same\ntime, I also don’t want to stop reading and working out. \nHowever, that’s sometimes more complicated than it\nsounds. In January of this year, I got the ﬂu. And when I\ncame back to our family business, I underestimated how\nmuch work I had to catch up with. I also wanted to keep\ncreating new content for my blog and online courses. I\nthought to myself: “I can’t do everything, so I’m going to cut\nback on daily exercise.”\nBIG MISTAKE\nHere’s what happened.\nInstead of daily exercise, I went to the gym 2–3\ntimes a week. And I ran once a week. (this was by\nthe end of January)\nFor the ﬁrst few weeks, nothing was wrong, and I\nfelt good. I was also productive.\nBut by the end of February, that changed. I started\nfeeling tired by the end of the day. Something that\n\f\nnever happens to me.\nI also started writing less. I had a big buﬀer of\narticles, so I did post 2 articles a week.\nBy March, I was at a productivity low. Fortunately, I\nalways stick to my productivity system. I managed\nto get the minimum amount of work that’s\nnecessary done. But I stopped creating.\nI started watching Netﬂix in the evening. I even\nwatched an episode of a TV show called 12\nMonkeys. It was complete shit. I much more prefer\nto read a book before bedtime.\nSo I got frustrated that I wasted my time.\nAnd when I’m frustrated, I start journaling and\nreﬂecting more.\nI looked at my habits. And I noticed I felt tired and\ngot less work done.\nWhy? The answer was: EXERCISE.\nActually, a lack of it.\nBy April, I shifted my focus again: Get back in\nshape.\nSo that’s what I’m doing now. And if you want to get in\nshape too, it’s important to understand what you’re aiming\nfor. For instance, I’m 6”3 and 181 pounds. But that doesn’t\nmean anything. Most common measures like the BMI are\npretty useless because they don’t say anything about your\nstrength. To be honest, I don’t care about measures or even\nmy exact fat percentage. Instead, I look at my ﬁtness and\nhow it impacts my daily life. When I’m in good shape, I can:\nRun 10K without stopping for rest.\nDeadlift, squat, and bench press my body weight at\nleast 8 times.\nAnd do at least 12 pull-ups.\nWhat’s that based on? My body and experience. In ﬁtness,\nthere’s no general rule. You must ﬁnd your own goal. To me,\na person should be able to at least lift or push the same\n\f\namount as their body weight. That helps you to function\nproperly in daily life. When you’re in good shape, you’ll have\nmore energy and focus.\nWant to ﬁnd your ﬁtness goal?\nRead books about ﬁtness and health, watch YouTube videos,\ntalk to experts, and then create a program that’s for you—\nnot a 21-year-old bodybuilder. Also, you don’t have to lift\nweights. Find something you enjoy and challenges you\nphysically at the same time. The cold reality is that if you\ndon’t use your strength and stamina, you lose it. But that\ndoesn’t mean you should neglect it. The same analogy that\nZig Ziglar once used to stress the importance of motivation\napplies here:\n“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither\ndoes bathing — that’s why we recommend it daily.”\nSo if you’re not working out every day, you’re not doing\nyourself a favor. The quality of life decreases when you stop\nworking out. And stop looking for silver bullets to feel better.\nI know, it’s not advice most of us like to hear. Exercising is\nhard. But that’s the whole point! The easiest solution for a\ngood life is right at your disposal: Your body. Are you\nneglecting it or strengthening it?\n\f\nIf You Want To Be More\nProductive, Research Shows You\nNeed A Break\nDo you spend the majority of your day at your desk? And do\nﬁnd it diﬃcult to concentrate throughout the day? There’s a\nsimple solution to improve your productivity and focus.\n“How can I get more stuﬀ done without being distracted?”\nThat’s a question I often get. It’s human nature: We always\nwant to improve output. For machines, it’s straightforward:\nYou improve speed. Machines get faster and better every\nday. But what about your personal productivity?  I’ve read\ndozens of books on productivity. I’ve read countless articles\non time-management. And I’ve tested diﬀerent methods to\nboost my productivity.\nThe idea is simple: I want to get more done in the same\namount of time. I’m not looking for shortcuts or hacks, so I\nhave to do less work. I don’t mind working. What I don’t like\nis the feeling of wasting time on stuﬀ that is meaningless.\nSometimes I start by watching one YouTube video, and\nBOOM, 2 hours have gone by.\nAnd then I get frustrated with YouTube. But that doesn’t\nmake sense. It’s like getting angry with alcohol after you’ve\nspent a night boozing. It’s not the alcohol, IT’S YOU. You just\ncouldn’t have one drink, or watch just one video. Couldn’t\nyou?\nI’ve found a way to eliminate that frustration with the\ndistractions of work (not boozing), which makes it lot more\nfun to work and less stressful.\n\f\nThe solution is simple: Take a 5-minute break after\nevery 30 minutes of work.\nIt’s also called the Pomodoro technique. The reason this\nmethod works is also simple: Evolutionary biology. The\nhuman brain can’t focus on a single task for long periods.\nOur brains are meant to ensure our survival. To protect us\nfrom looming threats the brain is in a constant state of\nalertness. So focusing on one thing for a long time is hard\nfor your brain.\nResearch by Alejandro Lleras, from the University of Illinois,\nshowed that deactivating and reactivating work allows us to\nstay focused. When you are completing long tasks, such as\nstudying for exams, making presentations or writing reports,\nit’s best to take short, and planned breaks.\nTaking breaks will also increase the quality of your\nwork. \nWhen you take a break, you force yourself to take a few\nseconds to reevaluate. Sometimes you ﬁnd that you have to\nadjust your work to increase the quality.\nIn contrast, when you work on a task, without a break, it’s\neasy to lose focus and get lost in the work. That’s why the\n5-minute breaks are equally important as the 30 minutes of\nwork. Take your breaks seriously — see them as a reward.\nUse your break to walk a bit, do some stretches, grab a cup\nof coﬀee or do something that relaxes you. Feel pleased\nwith the work you have done. I’ve been working in 30-\nminute intervals for over a year. I’ve never got so much\nwork done. I also ﬁnd it more fun and less stressful to work .\nI’ve experimented with diﬀerent time intervals (25, 30, and\n40 minutes), breaks, and 45 minutes is pretty much the\nmaximum. Some research shows that it’s counterproductive\n\f\nto focus for longer periods of time. So you can experiment\nwith how long you prefer to work before you take a break.\nIf you want to try this method, here are a few other\nthings that can help:\nUse an app to set the 30-minute interval. I\nuse Tomighty.\nAssign just one task to every 30-minute interval.\nDon’t skip your breaks.\nDon’t check your email during your break.\nTake a 15-minute break after 4 intervals.\nDon’t accept interruptions or false emergencies\nwhen you’re in a 30-minute stretch.\nSet a daily goal. For example; doing 10 x 30-minute\nintervals results in 300 minutes of productive work.\nWith all the noise, it’s easy to forget the importance of\ntaking breaks. You don’t need to read another article about\nproductivity. Instead, take a break. Sometimes we get lost in\nthe lists and productivity hacks. The truth is that no matter\nwhat you do to improve your productivity—you still have to\ndo the work. So you might as well get those 5-minute breaks\nto recharge."

    "raw_text": "Some people ask me, “Why do you read so many\nbooks? There’s no way you can apply everything you learn.”\nThey are right. I cannot. Why do I still read about all kinds of\ndiﬀerent topics?\nThere might come a time in my life where I will need one\nparticular piece of knowledge. And that one time I need\nit might just change the whole outcome of my life. I‘ll give\nyou an example. In 2015, after my friends and mentors told\nme I should share my ideas about productivity, life, and\nbusiness with others, I seriously started thinking about\ndoing it.\nBut there are many ways you can share your knowledge\nwith others. You can give training to groups and host\nseminars. You can coach people individually. You can create\nvideos for YouTube. You can give talks at conferences. The\npossibilities are endless. But because I’ve always had an\ninterest in writing and had read so much about it in the past,\nI realized that I should start with written ideas. That was the\neasiest way for me to get started.\nI had also learned all about creating websites in the past. So\nit was very easy for me to get started with all of this. In fact,\nI created a website in a day. And I started writing every day\nfor a month. The result? A book and a bunch of articles.\nKnow Your Direction. Not Your Destination.\nWhen I read about writing and building websites years ago, I\ndidn’t know I would use that knowledge to build my own\nblog.\nTo be honest, I didn’t know what I wanted. I only knew what\ndirection I wanted to go in. I knew I wanted to make a\ncontribution and do work that I enjoyed.\nSo it’s not important to know exactly what you want to do\nwith your life. People change. Economies change. So, it’s not\n\f\neven realistic to boldly claim “I know what I want!” The only\nthing every person needs is a sense of direction. A vision of\nwhere you’d like to go.\nLook, you don’t need to know your exact destination. You\noften read about people who say they always knew what\nthey wanted. But that’s just a small portion of the\npopulation. I’ve personally never met someone like that.\nMost of us don’t have that conviction from day one. It grows\nover time.\nIf you can’t decide what direction you want to go in life,\nthat’s automatically your #1 goal in life — to ﬁgure out\nwhere you want to go. That’s what Jay Abraham also\nrecommends in Getting Everything You Can Out of All You’ve\nGot (which is one of my favorite business books of all time):\n“Your ﬁrst priority is to identify what you want and then\nmake sure you take the path that’s going to give you that.\nThere’s nothing sadder than to see someone get to be\nseventy-ﬁve or eighty years old and look back regrettably\nbecause they pursued the wrong target.”\nYou see that he doesn’t say you should know exactly what\nyou want? That would not be realistic. Instead, we need to\nknow where we’re roughly going. I know, it remains\nintangible. But that’s the only helpful answer that I’ve found\nin life.\nWork On Universal Skills\nWhile you’re ﬁguring everything out, don’t waste your time\nwatching hours of TV, drinking booze, or eating junk\nfood. Spend your time usefully.\nLearn skills you can always rely on. Need some inspiration?\nHere are a few skills that I’m constantly working on:\n\f\n1. Self-Discipline: Get better at ignoring the\nnegative voice in your head. Get out of your bed.\nGo to the gym. Don’t listen to “I don’t want to.”\n2. Personal Eﬀectiveness: Learn how to maximize\nthe results you can get during the 16–18 hours\nyou’re awake. Get more done — eﬀectively.\n3. Communication: We think we’re all master\ncommunicators. But the truth is that we suck.\nCommunication is both art and science. And our\nability to work with others depends on it.\n4. Negotiation: You negotiate all the time. With your\nspouse, kids, parents, teachers, friends, co-workers,\nmanagers, etc. Learn to get the best deal for all\nparties.\n5. Persuasion: Learn how to get what you want in an\nethical way.\n6. Physical Strength & Stamina: Getting stronger\nis a skill. Pull your own weight. It’s something every\nhuman should be able to do.\n7. Flexibility: Sitting all day long behind your\ncomputer or in your car turns you into a stiﬀ being.\nLearn how to stretch your hips, lower back,\nhamstrings, and calves — the most common weak\npoints of desk workers.\nThat’s enough to keep you busy for a lifetime if you want to\ndo it well. Pick a skill that excites you. Get better at it. Then,\npick another. And keep on repeating that process. Soon\nenough, you’ll know what you want. And if you don’t, it’s not\nthe end of the world. There’s still plenty to learn.\n\f\nLeave The Office On Time and\nDon’t Take Your Work Home\nThese two lessons are true for every person who wants a\nlong, happy, and satisfying career. But it’s very hard to put\nthat advice into practice. It took me the ﬁrst six years of my\ncareer to ﬁgure that out. And I still have to remind myself\nthat life is bigger than work.\nAlmost everywhere that I’ve worked in the past, there was\na “perception is reality” culture. That means looks are more\nimportant than reality. In other words: The person who’s in\nthe oﬃce the longest appears to be the hardest worker.\nNow, that may be true.\nBut that’s not what matters. We all know that the only thing\nthat counts is results. However, we collectively insist on\nlooking at vanity factors like participation in meetings, hours\nspent at the oﬃce, and how fast people respond to emails.\nIt’s pathetic. At our family business, we encourage everyone\nto leave when they are done for the day. We’ve learned that\nfocusing on priorities is a much better metric than only\nlooking at the hours someone works.\nAnd still, people ﬁnd it uncomfortable to say, “I’ve ﬁnished\nmy top priorities, I’m going home.” I get it. When you work\nin a group, you don’t want to make others feel bad or that\nthings are unfair. But think about why you’re working in the\nﬁrst place. You’re there to contribute. To your own company,\nor the company you work for.\nWorking Too Long Is Unproductive\nNow, I’m sure people love to be in your presence for 10\nhours a day, but that doesn’t mean you have to stick around\n\f\nso long that you become unproductive. Because that’s one\nof the main reasons we’ve stopped working standard 9 or 10\nhour days. It’s useless.\nThere’s a large body of research that proves working long\nhours is counterproductive. Working too much and the\nstress that goes along with it can lead to depression, sleep\nproblems, impaired memory, and even heart disease. You\nget the idea. That’s why my ﬁrst rule of work is this:\nLeave On Time\nThe other day I was talking to my mentor about how great it\nis to love your job. He said: “I’ve never had a job in my life\nthat I didn’t love. It’s one of the most gratifying things in\nlife.”\nBut like my mother always says, “too much of a good thing\nbecomes bad.” I believe that’s the same with work. Now, I’m\nnot talking about intensity.\nDon’t get me wrong; I work my ass oﬀ. Always have done.\nBut just don’t go on for too long. The art of working hard is\nknowing when to quit. But like my mentor told me, that’s\nvery hard: “My biggest problem was that I worked too much.\nI left the house at 7 AM and came back at 11 PM. That’s too\nmuch.”\nYou must protect yourself against too much work. And it’s\nstraightforward. Just leave the oﬃce on time. Whether you\nlove your job or not — it doesn’t matter. When it’s time to\ngo home, GO!\nNo one needs you to be at the oﬃce 24/7. Only your ego\ndoes. Honestly, the oﬃce will be here tomorrow. Your co-\nworkers will still be alive. Your company will not go bust.\nWork is about achieving results. If you can’t do that in 6–8\nhours a day, you’re not eﬀective. So instead of working\n\f\novertime, read a book on personal eﬀectiveness or get\nproductivity training.\nLeave Your Work At Work\nBut don’t just go home and bring your work with you. That\ndefeats the whole purpose. No one thinks it’s cool when\nyou’re closing deals on the phone at dinner. You’re also not\ndoing yourself a service by continually thinking about work\nwhen you’re at home.\nRelax a bit. Play some Call of Duty. Cook dinner for your\nspouse. Take the kids for a walk. Whatever. Look, living a\nhappy life is very simple. It’s all within our control. We can\ndecide what makes us happy. I have printed this Marcus\nAurelius quote on my journal to remind me of that:\n“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within\nyourself, in your way of thinking.”\nWe all know that money, success, fame, or recognition, by\nthemselves, don’t make us happy. And yet, we work too\nmuch to obtain those things that don’t even make us happy\nin the ﬁrst place.\nSo why do we keep working too much that it hurts us? It\ncould be our ego. Maybe we just can’t help ourselves. It’s\ndiﬀerent for every person. Personally, I don’t care about the\nreason. All I know is that too much work has a negative\nimpact on the quality of your life and work.\nWhat matters is that we protect ourselves from our own\nstupidity. We’re just like kids. We need rules to live happily\nand safely.\nThat’s why the ﬁrst rule of work is that we leave the oﬃce\non time. The second rule is that we don’t take our work\nhome. And the third rule? Let’s not worry about that for now.\nWe’ll get to that another time. It’s time for me to go home.\n\f\nConsistency Is Key: Improve By\n0.1% Every Day\nDo you ever worry about things you don’t control? If you do,\njoin the club. It happens to all of us.\nBut worrying is a waste of time and energy. Imagine the\nfollowing situation: You make a mistake at work that upsets\na client. Maybe you send someone a wrong email. Maybe\nyou forget to solve a problem. It doesn’t matter what it is.\nImagine that something goes seriously wrong at work.\nWhat do you do when you ﬁnd out? Do you stress out? Feel\nuncomfortable? Blame yourself? Blame others? Think it’s\nthe end of your career? When things go wrong, we become\nour own worst enemy because we focus on things we don’t\ncontrol.\nIt’s one thing to read about these things. It’s another thing\nto actually put it in practice. Because when shit hits the fan\nit’s natural to panic. Instead of thinking, take a step back,\nand focus on what lies within your control. What do you\ncontrol? Essentially, we only control our own actions and\nmindset.\nWe determine our:\nDesire\nAttitude\nJudgments\nDetermination\nThat’s about it. Anything else, we have no control over.

What\ncounts is that we do the right thing because that is all we\ncan do. We don’t control outcomes. Do you see?\n1. Made a mistake? Correct it.\n2. Something goes wrong? Find a solution.\nAlso, never be surprised when bad things happen. But\nrather expect them to happen. In that way, you will never\nbe caught oﬀ guard.\nSimilarly, when you’re struck with bad luck, don’t complain\nand say stuﬀ like, “why me!?”\nInstead, accept it, and then focus your energy on ﬁnding a\nsolution. Always keep a positive mindset.\nWhy this exercise improves productivity.\nI’m often asked, “what does philosophy have to do with\nproductivity?” Well, if you want to be productive, the most\nimportant thing is consistency.\nProductivity is not about eureka moments, your big break,\npulling oﬀ all-nighters, or drinking Red Bull all day. If you\nwant to achieve things in your life, it’s about aiming for daily\nprogress. You want to exercise, read, work, learn, study,\nevery single day.\nInconsistency is the enemy of results.\nAnd that’s why I practice Stoic and Pragmatism philosophy\nto improve my mental toughness. It’s also a big part of my\npersonal productivity system, Procrastinate Zero.\nI don’t want ups and downs because that hurts productivity.\nInstead, I want to progress 0.1% every day of the year. And\nthat’s a very realistic goal. Try it and maybe it will change\nyour life too."

    "raw_text": "Who Says You Have To Get Out Of\nYour Comfort Zone?\nI love my comfort zone. To me, that’s where the real magic\nhappens. In my comfort zone, I have my family, friends,\nwork, music, books, movies, bike, gym, park; you name it.\nEverything I love. And from that place of safety, I’m more\nopen to trying new things and take risks. I’ve never believed\nthe idea of that stupid little drawing. You know what I’m\ntalking about, right?\n“Your comfort zone.” A little circle.\n“Where the magic happens.” A big circle that\nstands for the promise of success.\nAs if “magic” only happens when you step outside your\ncomfort zone; that’s ridiculous. And while we’re at it; why\npretend as if your comfort zone is bad? It’s this pathetic\nlittle circle displayed against the bigger “magical” circle.\nSure, I’m all about pushing yourself, trying new things,\nmoving forward, growing, etc. But in contrast to many\npopular self-help people, I don’t believe the comfort zone is\na bad thing.\nCall me a pessimist. Call me stoic. But more than anything,\nI’m merely a practical person. And practically speaking, you\ndon’t even want to make a huge leap outside your comfort\nzone. In fact, I believe in the slow road to “magic.”\nWhere’s The Magic People Talk About?\nI’ve found that I do my best work when I don’t worry about\nmoney, ﬁnding new friends, getting familiar with a new\nenvironment, and anything else that is related to always\nmoving around.\n\f\nBut don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying I prefer to stay put.\nStagnation is a death sentence for me. I believe that there\nare diﬀerent phases of life. Sometimes, you take it easy,\nwork on your skills, your character — you invest in yourself.\nAnd sometimes, you just go out there and take a chance.\nLife’s too short to be a wimp.\nBut those two things are interconnected. If you don’t work\non yourself, and if you lack self-conﬁdence, you will never\ntake a risk. For years I wanted to do what I’m doing now. But\ninstead of jumping out of my comfort zone (which was\nscary), I slowly took on new and bigger challenges.\nFirst, I got two degrees in business. Then, I started a\nbusiness together with my father. That was in 2010. And\nafter two years of working on that business for six or seven\ndays a week, I started doing freelance marketing work.\nAgain, after a few years of freelancing and starting (and\nfailing) other businesses on my own, I took a job at a\nresearch advisory ﬁrm because I wanted to know how it is to\nwork for a major corporation.\nAnd after doing that for a year and a half, I ﬁnally decided to\nwrite and talk about productivity, career, and\nentrepreneurship on the internet. By then, I‘d been doing\nthe things I write about for more than 10 years. And yet, I\ndon’t have all the answers—I just share the stuﬀ I’ve\nlearned.\nSo it would be ridiculous if I would join people who scream:\n“If you want to be successful, all you have to do is step\noutside your comfort zone. NOW!” Well, have you ever\nstepped outside your comfort zone? Even just a little bit\ncounts. And what did you ﬁnd? A leprechaun with a bag of\nmoney?\n\f\nNot going to happen.\nThat comfort zone shit is just a story. It might motivate\nsome people, but you don’t have to believe it if you don’t\nwant to. It’s just like when people claim you have to wake\nup early if you want to be successful. Says who? I believe\nthis: If you step outside your comfort zone, there’s only\nmore work waiting for you. It’s not fancy at all. There’s no\nmagic involved. Just blood, sweat, and tears.\nWork Your Way Up From A Place Of Comfort\nI think that most people who read these type of articles\nwant to achieve something. Maybe you want to quit your\njob, start a business, grow your business, become an artist,\npublish a book, whatever.\nAnd you probably also know that it’s not easy. So why do\nyou make things even harder for yourself by doing shit that"

Again,\nthat’s my practical mind speaking for me. Make some\ncalculations and ﬁgure your what that number is for you.\nAnd don’t even think about taking a risk before you have\nthat money on your savings account.\nAlso, build a skill set that’s worth something. One of the\nreasons I don’t care about money is because I trust my\nability to ﬁnd work. Even when I go broke tomorrow, I’ll ﬁnd\na way to get work the next day. I’ve invested years and\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in my education. The\nquestion is: What’s your skill? How can you add value to the\nworld? What problems can you solve?

    "raw_text": "you do, don’t stay in your comfort zone for too long. Try to\nkeep moving forward every day: Even if it’s just a tiny step.\nNo magic. Just eﬀort.\n\f\nIf You Can Believe It, You Can\nAchieve It\nI know what you’re thinking. “This guy probably read a\nmotivational quote on social media, and now he’s telling us\nthat nothing is impossible. Yeah right.” I think the world has\nno shortage of motivational articles, books, videos, or\nFacebook posts. You don’t need a bigger dose of\n#mondaymotivation. You know why? That type of\nmotivation is not practical. It doesn’t do anything. It’s not\nuseful. It’s the same as drinking Red Bull. It fades quickly.\nBelief, on the other hand, is a tool that’s extremely useful.\nAnd it’s underutilized by many. The problem is that most of\nus lack belief. And when I talk about belief, I talk about it\nfrom a practical point of view. I’m not talking about hope or\nfaith. I don’t believe that you can “hope” for the best, sit\nback and wait until good things happen to you. Hope is not\na strategy for life. I prefer to look at facts and make\nconclusions like a pragmatist. Like it or not, but everything\nthat’s ﬂoating in that head of yours is there because you\nbelieve it.\n“Life sucks.”\n“I’m not good at my job.”\n“I can never ﬁnd my dream job.”\n“No one loves me.”\n“I will never become successful.”\nSee? It’s all there because you believe those things. William\nJames, one of the primary ﬁgures associated with\npragmatism, put it best:\n“Belief will help create the fact.”\n\f\nBelief is a practical instrument that you can use to\nshape reality.\nHave you ever considered that you decide what you\nbelieve? Not your friends, colleagues, family, or even the\nmedia. You observe things, and then decide what you\nbelieve. That’s why belief creates facts. No, life is not an R.\nKelly song. You can’t ﬂy, no matter how hard you believe it.\nA pragmatist always keeps it real.\nYou will never become a respectable\nleader without putting in the work.\nYour life will never change unless you take\naction.\nBut that’s not the point. You know this. There’s no outcome\nwithout action.\nIt comes down to one thing: Do you believe that you can,\nor can’t live the life you want? It’s as simple as that. But it’s\nsomething that you truly have to believe. It’s one thing\nto say that you believe something. It’s a whole diﬀerent\nthing to actually believe. Let me highlight that by sharing a\npersonal story. For most of my life, I lived in fear. It all\nstarted at school. People told me:\n“If you don’t get good grades, you will not be accepted to a\ngood university, and without a good degree, you will never\nget a job, and you will become a bum who dies alone.”\nAfter hearing that, my seventeen-year-old brain went into a\nfull-ﬂedged panic mode. I started believing that stupid story.\nWho wants to become a bum and die alone?\nThat’s a metaphor for not believing in yourself. Because\nsomehow, that’s always the alternative. If you do something\nthat’s uncommon, or maybe a little risky, the common\n\f\nargument is that you become homeless. I meet a lot of\npeople who say they’ve made important life decisions based\non fear.\nDo you hate your job, but are you afraid to look for\nsomething else because you might lose your\nhouse?\nDo you want to leave your spouse, but are you\nafraid you’ll die alone?\nDo you study yourself to death because you’re\nafraid of what your parents will say when you quit?\nDo you never expose your work to the world\nbecause you’re afraid people will throw rocks at you\nbecause you suck?\nWill that really happen? Or is that just your mind acting up?\nProbably the latter. I always wanted to become a writer.\nBack in school, I wrote poems for my girlfriend. It was kind\nof pathetic, but hey, she enjoyed my weird poems. But all\njokes aside, I loved to read and enjoyed putting my thoughts\non paper.\nBut no, every adult in my life was trying to scare me to\ndeath. “You can’t make a living as a writer.” They were\nprobably right. It’s not easy to make a living by writing.\nSo what? Everything that’s worth it is hard. I didn’t realize\nthat back then. So I gave up my goal. I decided to pick the\nsafe road and pursue a degree in business. I don’t regret\nthat decision because I’ve learned many useful things. But\nthe whole experience turned me into a fearful creature.\nBecause after that whole scarefest in school, I eventually\nstopped believing in myself. I stopped writing and reading.\nAnd that’s a pure waste of time that I could’ve used for\npracticing my skills.\n\f\nYou can achieve anything (as long as you believe\nin it).\nWhat’s something you once believed in but stopped\nbelieving because of fear? I think we’ve all been there. If\nyou’re not careful, you’ll always stay there.\nFor me, it wasn’t until two or three years ago that I ﬁgured\nout belief is an instrument that can help you to achieve your\ngoals. Somehow I started reading about pragmatism (which\nis a way of thinking). And it completely changed my own\nway of thinking. I realized that not believing in yourself is\nuseless. So I decided to believe that I could live the life I\nwanted.\nGranted, I’m not fully paying the bills by writing yet. I run a\nbusiness and do consulting. But I do make some money with\nmy blog. And that’s pretty good to know for the seventeen-\nyear-old version of me. Believing in yourself is very simple.\nYou can do it too. Just understand that belief is an\ninstrument. That idea is not new or anything. It’s been\naround for hundreds of years. People just have diﬀerent\nnames for it.\nI don’t care how you call it. But guess what happened since\nI’ve been using belief as an instrument? Most things I\nbelieved are facts now. And the other stuﬀ I believe will one\nday become a fact.\nHow am I so certain? Because my mind can conceive it. And\nif your mind can conceive it, you can achieve it. That’s not a\nmotivational quote. That’s a fact. Do you believe it?"

    "raw_text": "Don’t Compete. Create!\nIf you think that you have to compete for better jobs or\nmore market share, you’re as wrong as I was. The idea of\ncompetition is engraved in our minds. We believe that we\nhave to compete for the same jobs with others. If someone\nhas a job, that means you can’t have the same job. And if a\ncompany has a certain market share, that means you have\nto compete with that company to “win” a piece of their\nshare.\nAt least, that’s what conventional advice says. It’s also what\nI learned in business school. My entire education was based\non competing with other businesses. And almost every\nbusiness book that I’ve read, also assumes that business is\ncompetition.\nThey couldn’t be more wrong. When you assume that you\nhave to compete with other businesses or people for money,\njobs or attention, you’re engaged in limited thinking.\nInstead, we must adopt an abundance mindset. Wallace D.\nWattles, one of the ﬁrst famed personal development\nauthors, said it best:\n“You get rid of the thought of competition. You are to create,\nnot to compete for what is already created. You do not have\nto take anything away from any one.”\nThe biggest mistake that conventional business thinkers\nmake is that they believe supply is limited. But that’s not\nalways the case. But even if it was the case, it’s harmful to\nadopt that mindset. I think that most people, entrepreneurs\nand those who are employed, are afraid that someone else\nbeats them to “it.”"

Exactly, you won’t grow!\nLife Is Abundant\nA quick look at history shows that mankind always kept\nmoving forward. Sure, we’ve had times of war and economic\ndownfall, but we always recovered and grew. So when\nyou’re expecting that the world economy will not grow,\nyou’re actually betting against mankind! I don’t believe that.\nHumans always ﬁnd a way to survive and prosper. That’s\nsimply what we do.\nYou must believe that we live in an abundant world.

But I also\nknow that many of these people limit themselves by\nthinking that they can’t create a career.\nSimilar to how I think entrepreneurs and companies should\ncreate market share, I also believe that individual people\nshould create a career. I recently met a “Chief Happiness\nOﬃcer” at a non-tech company—which is pretty unusual. I\ndid some research, and it appears that Ronald McDonald\nwas the ﬁrst who had the CHO title in 2003. After that, tech\ncompanies started adopting the title. It’s very simple. A CHO\nis responsible for the wellness and happiness of employees."

And naturally, they didn’t have a CHO position. She\ntold me she had to create the position. In the past, leaders\nbelieved that the only reason people will work for you is\nbecause of the salary. The more money you oﬀer, the better\nthe people you attract.\nThat might be true for some. But more money is not always\nbetter. Many people care more about having fun at work,\nfeeling appreciated, and being happy. And that’s what the\nCHO does successfully.\nHere’s the thing: It doesn’t matter what others think.

Before you\nknow it, you’ll have so much opportunity that you don’t\nknow what to do with it.\nIn The Netherlands, we call that a “luxury problem.” Believe\nme; it’s the only problem that you want to have.\n\f\nAll Strength Comes From\nRepetition\nThe biggest mistake you can make is to ignore the basics of\nyour profession. This is true no matter what you do, where\nyou live, or who you are.\nWhen you ignore the foundation of what makes you a good\nperson, athlete, friend, entrepreneur, student, etc., you will\nnever be consistent. That’s the biggest lessons I’ve learned\nfrom studying athletes. People who play professional sports\nare under constant pressure to perform.\nTake Daniel Cormier, the current UFC Light Heavyweight\nChampion, and former Olympic wrestler. The 38-year-old\nchampion has an impressive career until now. He won\nmultiple gold medals as a wrestler. And in MMA, he has won\n20 of his 22 ﬁghts in total. He’s considered as one of the\nbest.\nOn top of that, he’s also a combat sports analyst and co-\nhost of UFC Tonight on Fox Sports. The man is highly active.\nWhat is his key to success, according to himself? Focusing\non the basics. He says:\n“You don’t get to the highest levels of the sport without\nhaving the basics in order.”\nThat’s not only true for sports; it’s also true for everything\nelse in life. Writing, speaking, selling, leading, you name it.\nWithout having the basics in order, you’ll never achieve your\nfull potential.\nRepeat The Basics\nAnd there’s only one way to improve the basics, by\nrepetition. You get stronger by lifting weights, rep after rep.\n\f\nYou build stamina by performing anaerobic exercise. We all\nknow that. But how about your mind? How do you become\nmentally stronger? And why does it even matter? The\nanswer is simple: Everything starts with the mind. Steven\nPressﬁeld, the author of The War of Art, said it best:\n“Long-term, we must begin to build our internal strengths. It\nisn’t just skills like computer technology. It’s the old-\nfashioned basics of self-reliance, self-motivation, self-\nreinforcement, self-discipline, self-command.”\nBut my challenge was always: How do you do that? I know\nhow to get physically stronger. But I never knew how I could\nget mentally stronger. And whenever people told me “it’s all\nabout life experience” I always thought there was a better\nway. Let’s be honest, who wants to wait until they are 70 to\nget mentally strong?\nSome things can be done faster, especially if you keep\nrepeating the basics. Because that’s when we screw up\nmost of the time. We think we know everything.\nStay A Beginner\nHow often do you think to yourself, “I already know that”? If\nyou’re like most of us, quite often. One thing we have to\nremind ourselves is that the people who think they know\neverything are the biggest losers in life. I meet people all\nthe time who think they know everything. And I don’t even\nmention people on the internet. A lot of commenters always\nwant to show how smart they are and that this is “so\nobvious.” Well, that’s not how the greatest people in the\nworld approach things. Muhammad Ali once said that:\n“It’s the repetition of aﬃrmations that leads to belief. And\nonce that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to\nhappen.”\n\f\nWhen you repeat the basics, you don’t only become great;\nyou will stay great. It’s a challenge that all high performers\nface. I repeat the basics of many things in my life: Fitness,\nphilosophy, kindness, business, writing. For example, I re-\nread my favorite books on Stoicism every month to exercise\nmy mind.  I regularly grab The Elements Of Style by Strunk\n& White to repeat the basics of simple and eﬀective writing.\nIf I don’t repeat these things, I simply forget about my\nphilosophy for life or how to write good articles. That’s how\nour brain works. Without repetition, we forget things easily. I\nalways look at myself as a beginner. That’s one of the ﬁrst\n(and most important) lessons I learned from my\nmentor. He’s now in his seventies and still considers himself\nas a student of life.\nI have the same approach to business. I always go back to\nthe question of, “what is the purpose of a business?” I can\ntell you that if you answer, “to make money,” you need to\nrepeat the basics.\nIt’s very simple: Figure out what the basics are in your ﬁeld.\nAnd repeat them. Keep it simple. There’s no bigger waste of\ntime that repeating bad, wrong, or negative things. That’s\nthe only thing you should be mindful of. Don’t take advice\nfrom people who haven’t successfully done something\nthemselves.\nBe Great. Stay Great.\nLook, you can be very smart, driven, humble, etc., but if you\ndon’t stay that way — what’s it all worth? How often do you\nsee people become successful only to squander their\nsuccess? How many one-hit wonders have you seen?\nExactly. Only the great ones are here to stay.\nAnd if you want to stay here too, you must never\nunderestimate the power of repetition. Never think you’ve\n\f\nmade it or that you’re smart enough. Because that mindset\nis what keeps you great."

    "raw_text": "How I Measure My Life\nYou can easily measure a business by looking at the\nnumbers. Turnover, proﬁt, costs, employee churn, etc. But\nhow do you measure your life? There are no universal\nmetrics to assess your life. So it’s up to every person to\ncreate their own way to measure where they are in life.\nSome do that by looking at how much they earn compared\nto their peers. Some look at how far they climbed the\ncorporate ladder. Others measure themselves by how they\nlook.\nI have studied how the most successful thinkers of our time\nmeasure their lives. The answer is surprising. You rarely\nhear that successful people measure their life by the size of\ntheir bank account or any other conventional measure.\nInstead, people who‘re considered successful in the eye of\nsociety often look at these 3 factors:\n1. Energy\n2. Work\n3. Relationships\nI’ve experimented with improving all the three above things.\nWhat I’ve found is that they are all closely related. When I\nhave high energy, I’m in a good mood, and when I’m in a\ngood mood, I do better work. And when I do better work, I\nfeel satisﬁed with my life so I can give more to the people in\nmy life. And that improves my relationships. And what’s the\nsecret to a good life? Good relationships. Clayton M.\nChristensen, a Harvard Business School professor, and\nauthor of How Will You Measure Your Life? writes:\n“The single most important factor in our long-term\nhappiness is the relationships we have with our family and\n\f\nclose friends.”\nWhen it comes to relationships, quality matters more than\nquantity. Though it’s easy to pick on people who are\ninﬂuenced by social media, I still think it’s worth saying: No\none cares about how many followers or online friends you\nhave.\nReal relationships take a long time to grow. And they are\nalso unconditional. Most relationships are not real. We only\nlove someone until they, for example, change their views or\ngain a few pounds. Or we only invite friends to our birthdays\nas long as they go out with you and drink beer.\nThese types of conditional relationships are worthless. Real\nfriendship and love are stronger than that. You support the\npeople you love no matter what. That makes life rich.\n1. Measuring Energy\nMeasuring your energy is easy. All you have to do is look at\nhow you feel physically. I recently wrote about that\nspeciﬁcally. What matters is that you ﬁnd ways to increase\nyour energy. You can start by asking yourself one question:\nWhat small thing can I do today that has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on my energy? Here’s something that is true for\neveryone:\n1. Exercise every day — I lift weights four times a\nweek, do two interval runs, and make sure I walk at\nleast 30 minutes at a fast pace on the days I don’t\nwork out.\n2. Eat well — I don’t follow a speciﬁc diet. I eat meat,\nbread, pasta, and a bunch of other things that are\nsupposed to be bad for you. But I feel great. I just\ndon’t eat processed stuﬀ, and I eat very little sugar\n\f\n(I like chocolate). I also don’t consume more\ncalories than I burn.\nThat’s one part of the equation. When I do those two things\nevery day, I feel great. And my energy is also high. As soon\nas I stop working out or start eating unhealthy, I feel down.\nThat’s how I know this works. You can easily improve your\nenergy by exercising more and eating well.\n2. Measuring Work\nWhen it comes to work, I don’t look at income, status, or\nother generic measures. Instead, I look at how much I can\nstill learn. In other words: Have you reached your full\nlearning potential? Why do I look at learning and not\nincome? Because it matters more. Christensen puts it well\nin How Will You Measure Your Life?:\n“In order to really ﬁnd happiness, you need to continue\nlooking for opportunities that you believe are meaningful, in\nwhich you will be able to learn new things, to succeed, and\nbe given more and more responsibility to shoulder.”\nCareer and life success is directly related to how much you\nlearn. And more importantly: How much\nyou keep learning. Education never ends. Also, income is\ndirectly related to your learning development. The more you\nlearn, the more you earn. It’s true. Of course, there are\nlimits to this statement. And knowledge must always be put\ninto practice.\nWe’ve all heard about the smart people who’ve wasted their\npotential. To be successful, you must always act on what\nyou know. Without action, knowledge is useless. But\ngenerally speaking, the more knowledge you have (from\nexperience or studying), the more you can contribute to\nyour company, colleagues, clients, etc. And contribution\ntranslates to income.\n\f\n3. Measuring Relationships\nWhat you’ll ﬁnd is that the more you contribute to other\npeople’s lives, the better your relationships will be as a\nresult. And that ﬁnal ingredient completes the circle of life.\nWhen you measure your relationships, only stick to yourself.\nAvoid the biggest mistake most of us make: We look at what\nothers do for us. Otherwise, you risk that you start keeping\nscore.\n“How people treat you is their karma; how you react is\nyours.” As the late Wayne Dyer said.\nInstead of looking at how others treat you, measure how\nmuch time and energy you put into your relationships.\nThat’s the only thing you can control. My experience is that\nwhen you make time for the people that matter to you, the\nrelationships improve. And if they do not, the relationship\nwas probably not meant to be. We simply have to move on.\nThe real lesson here is that we always must focus on what\nwe can control.\nOur energy, our eﬀort at work, and what we put into our\nrelationships — these are all things we control. It’s one of\nthe main lessons philosophers from all over the world and\nfrom all ages tell us.\nLook at your life. Make a quick assessment of how you feel.\nAll you have to do now is to improve it.\n\f\nWhy You Should Live Like\nYou’re Immortal\nIt seems like all my peers have this idea that being young is\nan excuse for not living a satisfying life. But millennials are\nnot the only group of people who hide behind excuses. We\nall do. I get it. Taking on responsibilities in life is scary. It’s\nway cooler to have toast with avocado. But you know what’s\nalso cool?\nBuilding a meaningful career that you’re proud of.\nContributing to other people’s lives.\nCreating a product or service that is useful.\nInvesting your money for your retirement.\n“Yeah, but I’m still young.” “There’s always tomorrow!”\nC’mon. Stop hiding! What are you waiting for? To everyone\nout there that doesn’t feel fulﬁlled, I have one idea that I\nwant to share:\nStart living like you’re immortal.\nYes, I know it sounds weird. So give me two minutes to\nexplain. Conventional wisdom says that life is not forever,\nright?\n“Life is short!”\n“YOLO!”\n“Live now!”\nAnd I agree with that as well. But when you live your life\naccording to that philosophy, it doesn’t make sense to do\nanything that takes a long time to pay oﬀ. If you think that\nlife is short, why on earth would you do hard things? It\ndoesn’t make sense. From that perspective, it’s better to\nspend your money, go out every week, drink as much as\nyou can, and live large.\n\f\nAsk yourself: “What does all that lead to?”\nIt doesn’t take a scientist to answer that question. The\nanswer is, “nothing.” Now, there’s also another perspective\non living: That you’re here forever.\nThink about it. How diﬀerent would you live if I told you that\nyou’re never going to die? When I look at myself, I used to\nlive as if I were mortal. I’d spend my money on clothes,\ngadgets, holidays. But I also seemed to be in a hurry. I\nwanted to achieve a lot of things in my life. And preferably,\nvery fast.\nI also pursued many things at the same time. Just like a dog.\nChasing every shiny thing out there. Or even chasing my\nown random ideas. But lately, I’ve adopted a diﬀerent\nmindset. It’s an idea of, “What if I were immortal?” I know, it\nsounds like I’m working on a hyperbolic chamber that\npromises eternal life. But trust me, I’m not that delusional.\nI’m talking ﬁguratively. The ﬁrst time I got this idea was\nwhen I read one of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations:\n“Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now\ntake what’s left and live properly.”\nI’m particularly referring to the last part: Living properly.\nWhat does that mean? I think everyone has a diﬀerent\nperspective. To me, living properly means that I’m satisﬁed\nwith my life. That I can look myself in the mirror, and\ngenuinely say, “I like my life.” Was I truly satisﬁed when I\nlived my life in the now? No, not really. I didn’t have a real\ncareer, or a house, or anything that I was proud of. And why\nwas that? I was too focused on the now. I wanted things to\nhappen fast.\n“Before you know it, you’ll be dead!” Now, that mindset is\nﬁne to get started. Nothing works better than kicking\nsomeone in the butt by telling them they’re going to die.\n\f\nBut once you’re working on building a LIFE, it’s not helpful\nto think like that. Being present is a great thing, but like\nmany things in life, don’t overdo it.\nThat’s why I like to live like I’m immortal. Because\nwhen you live forever…\nYou have all the time in the world to build\nsomething.\nYou can make mistakes and learn from them.\nThere’s no pressure to make things happen fast.\nYou treat people with respect because other people\nwill also be around forever.\nThis small tweak in my mindset has helped me to take a\ndiﬀerent view on life. I’m not afraid to look 10 or 20 years\nahead. That helps me to make better decisions TODAY. For\nexample, I’d rather save my money or invest it instead of\nspending it because I know that “future Darius” will beneﬁt\nfrom that.\n“But how about the present, Darius?”\nWell, I talked about being satisﬁed, right? Odd enough, I’m\nmore satisﬁed when I SAVE my money. Or when I eat\nhealthy food or work out every day.\nWhen I think about this idea, I ﬁnd it fascinating how well it\nworks. We all know we’re going to die (I recently even wrote\nan article about it). That’s a good and bad thing.\nGood because it gives us urgency.\nBad because we lose sight of the big picture.\nHow do you live? Like a mortal or immortal person?\nWhatever it is, I hope you’re satisﬁed with your life. Because\nat the end of the day, that’s what matters most.\n\f\nThe Power Of Compounding: You\nCan Achieve Anything, If You Stop\nTrying To Do Everything\nDo you have a long list of goals, desires, and wants for your\nlife? Do you want to learn more? Earn more? Improve your\nskills? Get the most out of your relationships? Live better?\nAll those things are good. Life is about moving forward and\nmaking consistent progress. However, there’s one important\nthing about all this working, hustling, striving, and achieving\nmore: You can’t do everything at the same time.\nThat’s common sense, right? You only have so much time\nand energy. So if you take on too many things, you end up\nspread too thin. Instead, it’s much more eﬀective to focus\nyour eﬀort on one thing.\nSuccess Adds Up\nReal success happens when we focus on one thing at a time.\nThe ﬁrst time I discovered that idea was in high school.\nWhen I was preparing for my ﬁnal exams, I decided to study\nonly one subject at a time. And I only moved on to the next\nwhen I fully grasped the material.\nI noticed that I could learn something way faster if I\nimmersed myself in it for a few days. Most of my peers\nstudied multiple subjects a day. I never like that approach\nbecause it’s too scattered.\nIf I’m working on a project at work, I don’t pick up another\nbig project. If I’m working on a new course for my blog, I\ndon’t start writing a book at the same time. That strategy\nhelps me to get things done quicker and better. Hence, I\nachieve much more when I give my attention to one thing.\n\f\nGary Keller and Jay Papasan, authors of The One Thing,\nwhich is a great book about this same concept, said it best:\n“Where I’d had huge success, I had narrowed my\nconcentration to one thing, and where my success varied,\nmy focus had too.”\nAre you working on a lot of things? Is your attention not on\none thing? There’s a big chance that you will not achieve\nthe best possible results. Or worse: You might fail if you try\nto achieve many things at the same time The reason is\nsimple: Most of us believe that success happens all at once.\nReal life is diﬀerent. Keller and Papasan put it well:\n“Success is sequential, not simultaneous.”\nThings add up. You learn one skill. Then another. You ﬁnish\none project. Then another. Over time, your accomplishments\nadd up to form an impressive feat.\nThis is especially true for money. Most people earned their\nmoney over time. Few people make a big ﬁnancial splash.\nForget about the Conor McGregors and Evan Spiegels of this\nworld. These are people who hit the career jackpot. But you\ndon’t need special talent or skills to succeed in life. If you\ntake the long road, achieve one goal after the other, and\nbuild up your wealth step by step, you are more likely to live\na good life. It’s simple. And it always works. People who say\nit doesn’t just haven’t had the patience to apply it to their\nown life.\nOne of my mentors owns a few dozen properties, worth\nmillions. He acquired his wealth over time. He’s in his sixties\nnow. You see, things take time. And when you combine\npatience with compounding, you achieve the biggest\nresults. And these are not extraordinary things. I’m not\npromising you a gold medal at the 2020 Olympics or that\n\f\nyou’ll become the next Zuckerberg. Everyone can save\nmoney, improve their skills, and create wealth.\nThe Impact Of Long-Term Compounding\nIt’s incredibly corny example, but take Warren Buﬀett. This\nis how he built his wealth over time.\nSource: dadaviz.com\nDon’t look at the numbers (or random x-axis). Look at the\nrelative growth. Between age 32 and age 44, Buﬀett\nimproved his net worth by 1257%. That’s pretty exceptional\ngrowth over 12 years, right? Especially if you take into\naccount that he lost a lot of money in his 40s. But that’s not\nthe point here. Look at this. From age 44 to 56, Warren\nBuﬀett’s wealth increased by a ridiculous 7268% over a\nsimilar time period. And of course, this is his net worth and\nthere’s always luck involved with these type of numbers.\nPlus, his net worth is based on stock prices — which means\na big portion of it could be all gone tomorrow. But still, it’s\nabout the growth he achieved over time.\nAnother thing: Buﬀett acquired 99% of his net worth after\nhe became 50. Think about all those spoiled idiots in their\nteens, twenties, and even thirties (me included), who\n\f\ncomplain about the slow progress of their career. This helps\nyou to put things in perspective.\nAnyway, there’s a lot of Warren Buﬀett porn on the internet.\nAnd a lot of people pretend you can become rich by\ninvesting in the stock market. All you need to do is to buy\ntheir course that contains all the secrets to wealth. Yeah\nright. It doesn’t work that way. Personally, I hate stocks, and\nI think normal folks should stay away from Wall Street. I\nprefer real estate. However, Buﬀett is the perfect example\nof sequential success. You can achieve big things with small\nactions, that build up over time.\nThis is not only true for money. The same concept applies to\nskills, health, and relationships. You don’t build a strong\nbody in a day, month, or even a year. It takes years of\nconsistent eﬀort. Shortcuts don’t exist, no matter how\n‘smart’ you work. For example, cyclists under the age of 28\nrarely win big races like The Tour The France because it\ntakes them years to build the strength, stamina, and\nmindset you need to win.\nIf you want to see the impact of compounding in your own\nlife, it requires you to focus on one thing at a time (for every\naspect of your life) and always look at the bigger picture. It\ncomes down to this: You’ll get there if you put in the work.\nWho cares if it’s tomorrow or 20 years? It will happen. That’s\nall that matters.\n\f\nPostscript\nAfter spending hours of reading and editing my own articles\nof the past three years, I noticed that there are a lot of\ncontradictions. I’m very pleased with that. A person who\ndoesn’t contradicts himself is an idiot.\nLife is not about what you know. It’s about what you don’t\nknow. And we never know enough. That’s good news for the\nboth of us. It means that until the day we die, we can keep\nlearning.\nAnother thing I noticed is that I forgot about some of the\nthings I wrote. “Did I write that?” It’s not that I’m impressed\nby my own writing. Far from it. I’m surprised by the amount\nof knowledge that we forget. The good thing is that I’m\naware of this human ﬂaw. We think we know a lot because\nwe might be well read—but in fact, we forget more than we\nremember.\nI will keep referring back to the things I’ve learned, and I will\nnever assume I’ve “mastered” something. Because there is\nalways more to learn.\nThanks for reading this book.\nPlease let me know your thoughts:\ndariusforoux@gmail.com.\n-Darius"
