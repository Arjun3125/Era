    "raw_text": "The Harvest\n37\nHarvesting a Philosophy of Personal Development through \na Popular Business Classic Who Moved My Cheese?\nProf. Hriseekesh Upadhyay1\nProfessor of English, Tribhuvan University, Nepal\nAbstract\nPhilosophy of Management is a relatively new term compared to the tradition of \nPhilosophy itself. If Management as a university discipline is barely a century old, \nPhilosophy of Management has a history of only a few decades. As Management broadly \nconcerns conducting the affairs of a corporation or a business enterprise effectively, \nwriters on management hesitate to adorn the title Philosophy to the issues they deal in \ntheir discourse. Management Department in universities and colleges invariably project \ntheir fields as a science with tools, techniques and methods of their own. Increasingly \nUniversity dons in Management and successful executives of top business corporations \nbegan sounding about Philosophy of Management. A century after the first MBAs \ngraduated from the US universities, Philosophy of Management has emerged as an \nacademic discipline of its own. Personal Development of corporate executives, frontline \nbusiness personnel and lowly staff members of business houses has been an important \nsub-field of Philosophy of Management. Dr. Spencer Johnson’ s Who Moved My Cheese? \n(1998) has been a popular business classic that is a unique source of constructing a \nphilosophy of personal development. This paper explores the concept of change as a \ncritical element in the life of individuals and business organizations for successfully \nnavigating the constantly changing world which can expand the basis   of Philosophy \nof Management. Ability to perceive change that occurs in a small degree, to anticipate \nchanges in the world of things, to prepare oneself for the changes that arrive and not to \nfear to confront changes and to understand that changes can bring better options are \nsome of the philosophical lessons in the parable of Johnson’ s book. \nKey Words: management as tools, science and method; philosophy of \nmanagement; parable of personal development; four characters and \nfour perspectives in personal development; change and how to use it \nfor personal growth.\n1 Prof. Upadhyay is associated with IACER, Pokhara University, Nepal.\n\f\n38\nProf. Hriseekesh Upadhyay: Harvesting a Philosophy of Personal Development through a Popular Business .......\nManagement as an academic discipline has a short history compared to traditional subjects \nlike art, literature, science, law, philosophy and divinity. It was in the New World and in \nthe new emerging power the United States that Business Studies began taking roots in the \nearly 1900. As the United States developed into a giant of economic and industrial power \nhouse following the successful adoption of the Industrial Revolution, its focus shifted to \nchannelize human resources that can harness everything that nature contained in its farm \nland, mines, forests, rivers and oceanic fields. On the one hand engineers and technologists \nwere trained in technical institutes, self-trained business managers, financiers, bankers \nand investors scoured the cities and metropolises of the new nation for opportunities to \nenrich themselves and the nation. Time came when the president of the country Calvin \nCoolidge in 1925 took pride in declaring that ‘The chief business of the American people \nis business’. He also added that civilization and profit go hand in hand.\nAs businesses and industries flourished, business houses and giant corporations \nmobilized huge army of personnel to produce goods in factories, to supply them to the \nmarkets, to plan and expand businesses and industries, to organize sales and distribution \nand confront the vast operations involving money, capital, materials and of course the \nlife and livelihoods of millions of people in the country. When a business house run as \nfamily enterprise with few helping hands grew into a business corporation or gigantic \nindustrial operation with hundreds and even thousands of workers, gradation of \npersonnel at various levels took shape. Businesses and industries spawned various other \nsupporting fields such as banking, finance, insurance, training, recruiting professionals \nat various levels.  Thus emerged a managerial class, business executives and all powerful \nBoard of Directors and top level executives, their advisors and consultants.\nManagement: Dawn of a New Science\nEarly writings on how to run a large business or a huge corporation focused on organization, \ninvestment, finance, production, marketing, hiring, training and motivating staff and beating \ncompetitors. The main focus was to continue attaining higher growth for every quarter of \nfinancial reporting and keeping the shareholders happy and enriched. Business Management \ngradually took shape as a series of methods, techniques, approaches developed in various \nbusinesses and corporation. When Standard Oil, IBM, General Motors, Citicorp, Western \nPacific and dozens of business corporations rose to prominence with financial power and"

    "raw_text": "The Harvest\n39\nindustrial base greater than any state or federal government, America had entered into an \nera in which the ideas, concepts and practices of running a business needed to be given \nan aura of respectability and prestige. As a result, many business corporations supported \nvarious universities and colleges to offer courses in business studies, business finance, \naccounting, skill development and effective business administration.\nTomes were written with titles like Principles of Management, Business Management \nfor the New Era, Business Practices for the Business Executive, Business Leadership for \nOur Time, Trade and Prosperity for All. Thousands of graduate students and hundreds of \nmanagement faculty spent their time discussing the best practices to reap more and more \nreturns to their investment of capital, intelligence and time. One would not be ridiculed \nfor thinking that America has gained a new religion in business and its churches are \nBusiness Schools of major cities. In recent decades, US alone produces 100, 000 MBAs, \nof which 1200 graduate from Harvard Business School (Broughton, 2013).\nHarvard University became the first institution of higher learning to introduce Business \nStudies at the undergraduate and graduate levels under Harvard Business School which \nis still the top school of business and management in the world. As people rushed to \nget business and management degrees in order to land jobs and positions in business \ncorporations, universities across the United States opened BBA/BBS/MBA/ MBS and \nsimilar related programs. Along with Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Colombia and New York \nUniversities in east coast opened business and management studies. Soon universities \nall over America and Europe opened business and management schools and today \nmanagement and business studies remain the single largest area of higher education.\nIn Nepal too business and management studies have attracted the largest body of \nstudent population. Having a degree in business, finance and management seems a \nsure way of getting a good start in one’s career. A curious thing happening in Nepal’s \neducation system is that business and management courses are introduced at the school \nlevel itself which supersedes students’ chances of studying other foundational subjects. \nAs such students move to undergraduate levels, they seem not to have gained sufficient \ngrounding in math, science, history and languages. This makes them less able to deal \nintellectually with the increasingly complex world of today."

    "raw_text": "40\nProf. Hriseekesh Upadhyay: Harvesting a Philosophy of Personal Development through a Popular Business .......\nTowards Philosophy of Management\nManagement as a university discipline came out during the last one hundred years. \nIt developed as part of business studies to help business houses run their businesses \nsmoothly. As businesses expanded with the growth of Industrial Revolution, limited \nperspective of business studies had to give way to larger issues of management \ncomprising a whole lot of areas beyond business organization, finance, accounting, \nmarketing. While business and management studies focused on solving immediate \npractical problems and looking into concrete aspects of business and management, \nbringing philosophy into it would mean to discuss and speculate on the nature of \nproblem itself. American business and corporate houses are often criticized for only \nlooking for how to secure big growth in their quarterly financial report, not for long \nterm consequences of short sighted growth. Philosophical discussion of growth and \nsuccess takes up an entirely different approach (McCormack, 1998). Paul Griseri \nproposes some of the issues to be covered in the philosophy of management include: \nbusiness ethics, consequentialism, ethical theories and positivism (2013).\nAlong with these concerns, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a recent \ndevelopment in management and business studies circle which concerns philosophical \nissues. Business and corporate establishments are now increasingly goaded by public \nopinion to support and provide for public service functions. One of the first corporate \ncaptains to broach this philosophical concern is the founder of the Virgin Atlantic \nRichard Branson. He writes in his Autobiography: “Man created the problem. Man \nshould solve the problem. There must be somebody out there who can sort it out. There \nare a lot of good brains out there”. It is people with exposure to the philosophical bend \nof thinking who connect business success with enriching of civilization.\nThis lack of philosophical approach in business and management studies has led to \nvarious successful MBA graduates to write books with titles such as What They Don’t \nTeach you at Harvard Business School  (McCormack, 1986). To lead a successful \nbusiness or corporate house, executives need to be enlightened and imaginative. It \napplies to business leaders as well as private individuals. We need to be aware of our"

It is here I would like to discuss the modern business classic \nwhich forms the title of this paper. \nWho Moved My Cheese? A Parable for Personal Development\nMuch of business and management writing concerns with facts, figures, graphs, \nprojections of profits and losses. Case Studies purport to present human angles to \nreflect the conditions in the real world. But the case studies are so tied to the actual \nworld conditions and restricted to remain within the boundary of verifiability that \ncreative imaginative touches go missing in them. \nSpencer Johnson’s book Who Moved My Cheese?  (1998) is a parable for personal \ndevelopment, understanding change that confronts us every moment and every day of \nour existence and adapting to change to avoid personal loss and even disaster. Most \npeople living a comfortable life expect their life to go on as usual. What has continued \nas normal would appear to remain so for the future as well. A roaring business and \nindustry would seem to continue flourishing and expand in the years ahead. It is a \nhuman weakness that we expect better days to come, and do not have the forethought \nto imagine what is comfortable may collapse without as much a warning. We often \nhear change is the rule of life. Things go on changing slowly which we do not notice; \nwhen we face an abrupt change in our circumstances we are overwhelmed. \nThe book’s sub-title is: An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in  \nYour Life. Change is taking place in our life, in the work we do and the world we live \nin. This is a philosophical reflection. All the four characters in the story fail to perceive \nor imagine change. If they had thought how the cheese was placed there, whether the \nMaze also had other chambers with better supply of cheese they would not have faced \nthe shock of their life. They would not have faced starvation if they had thought about \ninevitable changes coming to their life.\nThe parable Who Moved My Cheese? presents two sets of characters: Sniff and Scurry \nare two mice and Hem and Haw are two little people. They move near the Maze and\n\f\n42\nProf. Hriseekesh Upadhyay: Harvesting a Philosophy of Personal Development through a Popular Business .......\nfind stack of cheese in a corner they like to call Cheese Station C. They feel great to \nhave the cheese all the time when they go to the Cheese Station. Cheese stands for \nwhat is valuable to them. It is a source of food, a source of comfort, and it makes their \nlife fulfilled. They do not try to explore other corners of the Maze. They are happy \nwith what they have got without much effort. Most importantly, they never pause to \nthink that their supply of cheese may stop being there at the station. One day when they \nappear to the Station C there is no cheese waiting for them.\nFirst Sniff and Scurry find their favorite cheese stack was empty. Then two little people \nHem and Haw arrive to the Cheese Station C. They are shocked to find the cheese stack \nempty. Now what can they do? They had no idea of the many chambers around the Maze \nwhich offered various options to make their life comfortable. Both the mice and little \npeople had been too smug about their comfortable life eating cheese as much as they \nwanted. They never tried to find out how the cheese arrived there, what was the condition \nof cheese, whether it was developing mold because it was there for a long time.\nSniff had felt the cheese was not tasting as fresh as before for some time. But he did \nnot act on that knowledge. Scurry would have acted had he learned the cheese losing \nits freshness. Learning about a danger is one thing, to act swiftly on the knowledge is \nmore important. Many of us do not see the danger coming; others fail to act even when \nthey felt danger clearly. Sniff can sense the danger around him, but failed to act on that \nknowledge. Scurry would have acted swiftly, but he got no knowledge of the impending \ndanger. Upon learning the loss of the supply of their cheese Hem and Haw complained \nto their fate. They grumbled it was unfair. It is a terrible mistake to go on complaining, \nrather than taking quick action to deal with the situation at hand. Haw wanted to move \naround the Maze to see if there are other chambers which may have fresh supply of \ncheese. He follows the change that befell on him and enjoys a new beginning in his life. \nHem did not like to try right away if they can find cheese in some other chambers.\n\f\nThe Harvest\n43\n\f\n44\nProf. Hriseekesh Upadhyay: Harvesting a Philosophy of Personal Development through a Popular Business .......\nA Summing Up\nSpencer Johnson’s little book has sold over 30million copies. It is certainly one of the \nmost successful business books ever. The beauty of the text is it can be read under \none hour. It has appeal for all age groups, gender and races, and nationalities. It tells a \nsimple story with profound meaning for life of individuals and institutions. It is now \na classic text in understanding the issues around personal development at individual \nlevel or corporate levels. Are you like one of the four characters in the parable who \ndoes not try even to explore the different compartments of the Maze they live in?  The \nMaze stands for our world where countless opportunities present themselves. Having a \nsupply of cheese whenever one wished to get it made the characters lose initiative and \naction. An individual or a business must expect change in their circumstances. If one \nis aware of change coming their way they can better prepare to avoid shocks and life \nthreatening disaster faced by the four figures in the story.\nThe management and business practitioners can deduct various philosophical \nconclusions from this tale. It is like harvesting or gleaning grains from a rich farm field \nat the end of farming season. One needs to go on building upon what is discovered. \nThe format of the text follows dialogue, narration and discussion. It is reminiscent of \nPlato’s writing that uses simple dialogue among people in the city square to thresh out \nserious issues of life. What is a more important issue in life than anticipating change \nand prepare to live with the inevitable change? How to deal with change in our life and \nwork has been a philosophical question of all time. \nReferences\nBranson, Richard. Losing My Virginity: The Autobiography.
