GE YOU TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF AGAINST SUCH FEAR, DIRECT ALL THINKING, EXERCISES, AND READING THIS WAY—AND YOU WILL KNOW THE ONLY PATH TO HUMAN FREEDOM.”

EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.26.38–39

ONE STEEL HIMSELF BEFORE HE COMMITTED SUICIDE RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO JULIUS CAESAR'S DESTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC, THE GREAT STOIC PHILOSOPHER CATO READ A BIT OF PLATO'S PHAEDO. IN IT, PLATO WRITES, "IT IS THE CHILD WITHIN US THAT TREMBLES BEFORE DEATH." DEATH IS SCARY BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN UNKNOWN. NO ONE CAN COME BACK AND TELL US WHAT IT IS LIKE. WE ARE IN THE DARK ABOUT IT.

AS CHILDLIKE AND ULTIMATELY IGNORANT AS WE ARE ABOUT DEATH, THERE ARE PLenty OF WISE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN AT LEAST PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE. THERE'S A REASON THAT THE WORLD'S OLDEST PEOPLE NEVER SEEM TO BE AFRAID OF DEATH: THEY'VE HAD MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT THAN WE HAVE (AND THEY REALIZED HOW POINTLESS WORRYING WAS). THERE ARE OTHER WONDERFUL RESOURCES: FLORIDA SCOTT-MAXWELL'S STOIC DIARY DURING HER TERMINAL ILLNESS, THE MEASURE OF MY DAYS, IS ONE. SENECA'S FAMOUS WORDS TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS, WHO HAD BROKEN DOWN AND BEGGED WITH HIS EXECUTIONERS, IS ANOTHER. "WHERE," SENECA GENTLY CHIDED THEM, "ARE YOUR MAXIMS OF PHILOSOPHY, OR THE PREPARATION OF SO MANY YEARS' STUDY AGAINST EVILS TO COME?" THROUGHOUT PHILOSOPHY THERE ARE INSPIRING, BRAVE WORDS FROM BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN HELP US FACE THIS FEAR.

THERE IS ANOTHER HELPFUL CONSIDERATION ABOUT DEATH FROM THE STOICS. IF DEATH IS TRUALLY THE END, THEN WHAT IS THERE EXACTLY TO FEAR? FOR EVERYTHING FROM YOUR FEARS TO YOUR PAIN RECEPTORS TO YOUR WORRIES AND YOUR REMAINING WISHES, THEY WILL PERISH WITH YOU. AS FRIGHTENING AS DEATH MIGHT SEEM, REMEMBER: IT CONTAINS WITHIN IT THE END OF FEAR.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW FOR YOUR YEARS?

"Many times an old man has no other evidence besides his age to prove he has lived a long time."

— SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 3.8

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ALIVE? TAKE THE YEARS, MULTIPLY THEM BY 365, AND THEN BY 24. HOW MANY HOURS HAVE YOU LIVED? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW FOR ALL OF THEM?

THE ANSWER FOR MANY PEOPLE IS: NOT ENOUGH. WE HAD SO MANY HOURS THAT WE TOOK THEM FOR GRANTED. ALL WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR OUR TIME ON THIS PLANET ARE ROUNDS OF GOLF, YEARS SPENT AT THE OFFICE, TIME SPENT WATCHING MEDIOCRE MOVIES, A STACK OF MINDLESS BOOKS WE HARDLY REMEMBER READING, AND MAYBE A GARAGE FULL OF TOYS. WE'RE LIKE THE CHARACTER IN RAYMOND CHANDLER'S THE LONG GOODBYE: "MOSTLY, I JUST KILL TIME," HE SAYS, "AND IT DIES HARD."

ONE DAY, OUR HOURS WILL BEGIN TO RUN OUT. IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY: "HEY, I REALLY MADE THE MOST OF IT." NOT IN THE FORM OF ACHIEVEMENTS, NOT MONEY, NOT STATUS—you know what the Stoics think of all that—but in wisdom, insight, and real progress in the things that all humans struggle against.

WHAT IF YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU REALLY MADE SOMETHING OF THIS TIME THAT YOU HAD? WHAT IF YOU COULD PROVE THAT YOU REALLY DID LIVE [INSERT NUMBER] YEARS? AND NOT JUST LIVED THEM, BUT LIVED THEM FULLY?

STAKE YOUR OWN CLAIM

"For it is disgraceful for an old person, or one in sight of old age, to have only the knowledge carried in their notebooks. Zeno said this... what do you say? Cleanthes said that... what do you say? How long will you be compelled by the claims of another? Take charge and stake your own claim—something posterity will carry in its notebook."

SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 33.7

USING IN HIS NOTEBOOK ABOUT THE TOPIC OF IMMORTALITY, RALPH WALDO EMERSON COMPLAINED HOW WRITERS DANCE AROUND A DIFFICULT TOPIC BY RELYING ON QUOTES. "I HATE QUOTATION," HE WROTE. "TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW."

SENECA WAS THROWING DOWN THE SAME GAUNTLET SOME TWENTY CENTURIES BEFORE. IT'S EASIER TO QUOTE, TO RELY ON SUCCESS AND ADULthood HAS TURNED THEM INTO A WINE SNOB (THOUGH THE LOGIC CAN BE APPLIED JUST AS EASILY TO FOODIES, TECHIES, AUDIOPHILES, AND THE LIKE).

AS FUN AND EXCITING AND PLEASURABLE AS THESE PLEASURES ARE, IT'S WORTH PUTTING THEM IN THEIR PLACE. YOU DON'T GET A PRIZE AT THE END OF YOUR LIFE FOR HAVING CONSUMED MORE, WORKED MORE, SPENT MORE, COLLECTED MORE, OR LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE VARIOUS VINTAGES THAN EVERYONE ELSE. YOU ARE JUST A CONDUIT, A VESSEL THAT TEMPORARILY HELD OR INTERACTED WITH THESE FANCY ITEMS.

IF YOU FIND YOURSELF LUSTING OVER THEM, THIS MEDITATION MIGHT HELP REDUCE THEIR LUSTER JUST A SMIDGE.

DON'T BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS

"The mind must be given relaxation—it will rise improved and sharper after a good break. Just as rich fields must not be forced—for they will quickly lose their fertility if never given a break—so constant work on the anvil will fracture the force of the mind. But it regains its powers if it is set free and relaxed for a while. Constant work gives rise to a certain kind of dullness and feebleness in the rational soul."

SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 17.5

ONE CAN'T READ MARCUS AURELIUS AND SENECA AND NOT BE STRUCK BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO RADICALLY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES. EACH HAD HIS OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE ENTRUSTED WITH THE IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY OF AN EMPIRE? PROBABLY MARCUS. BUT WHO WOULD YOU RATHER BE AS A PERSON? PROBABLY SENECA.

ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT SENECA SEEMS TO HAVE HAD WHAT WE WOULD NOW REFER TO AS WORK/LIFE BALANCE. WHEREAS MARCUS CAN READ AS THOUGH HE'S WORN DOWN AND TIRED, SENECA ALWAYS FEELS ENERGETIC, FRESH, ROBUST. HIS PHILOSOPHY OF REST AND RELAXATION—INTERMIXED WITH HIS RIGOROUS STUDY AND OTHER STOIC RITUALS—PROBABLY HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.

THE MIND IS A MUSCLE, AND LIKE THE REST, IT CAN BE STRAINED, OVERWORKED, EVEN INJURED. OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IS ALSO WORN DOWN BY OVERCOMMITMENT, A LACK OF REST, AND BAD HABITS. REMEMBER THE TALL TALE ABOUT JOHN HENRY—the MAN WHO CHALLENGED THE MACHINE? HE DIED OF EXHAUSTION AT THE END. DON'T FORGET THAT.

TODAY, YOU MAY FACE THINGS THAT TRY YOUR PATIENCE, REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE FOCUS OR CLARITY, OR DEMAND CREATIVE BREAKTHROUGHS. LIFE IS A LONG HUAL—it WILL MEAN MANY SUCH MOMENTS. ARE YOU GOING
