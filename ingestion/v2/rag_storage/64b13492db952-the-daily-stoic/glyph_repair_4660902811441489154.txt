AL HAPINESS FELT LIKE. ONCE HE DID, HE KNEW HE WOULD STOP. HE COULD GO BACK TO THE STRUGGLE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. HE HAD THE IDEAL FOR A MOMENT AND THAT WAS ENOUGH.

PERHAPS TODAY WILL BE THE DAY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS OR WISDOM. DON'T TRY TO GRAB THAT MOMENT AND HOLD ON TO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT. IT'S NOT UNDER YOUR CONTROL HOW LONG IT LASTS. ENJOY IT, RECOGNIZE IT, REMEMBER IT. HAVING IT FOR A MOMENT IS THE SAME AS HAVING IT FOREVER.

THE GLASS IS ALREADY BROKEN

"Fortune falls heavily on those for whom she's unexpected. The one always on the lookout easily endures."
— SENECA, ON CONSOLATION TO HELVIA, 5.3

HERE IS A STORY OF A ZEN MASTER WHO HAD A BEAUTIFUL PRIZED CUP. THE MASTER WOULD REPEAT TO HIMSELF, "THE GLASS IS ALREADY BROKEN." HE ENJOYED THE CUP. HE USED IT. HE SHOWED IT OFF TO VISITORS. BUT IN HIS MIND, IT WAS ALREADY BROKEN. AND SO ONE DAY, WHEN IT ACTUALLY DID BREAK, HE SIMPLY SAID, "OF COURSE."

THIS IS HOW THE STOICS THINK TOO. THERE IS SUPPOSEDLY A TRUE STORY ABOUT EPICTETUS AND A LAMP. HE NEVER LOCKED HIS HOUSE, AND SO HIS EXPENSIVE LAMP WAS STOLEN. WHEN EPICETES REPLACED IT, HE REPLACED IT WITH A CHEAPER ONE SO HE COULD BE LESS ATTACHED TO IT IF IT WERE STOLEN AGAIN.

DEVASTATION—that feeling that we’re absolutely crushed and shocked by an event—is a factor of how unlikely we considered that event in the first place. No one is wrecked by the fact that it’s snowing in the winter, because we’ve accepted (and even anticipated) this turn of events. What about the occurrences that surprise us? We might not be so shocked if we took the time to consider their possibility.

ATTACHMENTS ARE THE ENEMY

"In short, you must remember this—that if you hold anything dear outside of your own reasoned choice, you will have destroyed your capacity for choice."
— EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.4.23

ACCORDING TO ANTHONY DE MELLO, "THERE IS ONE THING AND ONLY ONE THING THAT CAUSES UNHAPPINESS. THE NAME OF THAT THING IS ATTACHMENT." ATTACHMENTS TO AN IMAGE YOU HAVE OF A PERSON, ATTACHMENTS TO WEALTH AND STATUS, ATTACHMENTS TO A CERTAIN PLACE OR TIME, ATTACHMENTS TO A JOB OR TO A LIFESTYLE. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS FOR ONE REASON: THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR REASONED CHOICE. HOW LONG WE KEEP THEM IS NOT IN OUR CONTROL.

AS EPICTETUS REALIZED SOME TWO THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE DE MELLO, OUR ATTACHMENTS ARE WHAT MAKE IT SO HARD TO ACCEPT CHANGE. ONCE WE HAVE THEM, WE DON'T WANT TO LET GO. WE BECOME SLAVES TO MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO. WE ARE LIKE THE RED QUEEN IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND—RUNNING FASTER AND FASTER TO STAY IN THE SAME PLACE.

BUT EVERYTHING IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF CHANGE. WE HAVE CERTAIN THINGS FOR A WHILE AND THEN LOSE THEM. THE ONLY PERMANENT THING IS PROHAIRETIS, OUR CAPACITY FOR REASONED CHOICE. THE THINGS WE ARE ATTACHED TO CAN COME AND GO, OUR CHOICE IS RESILIENT AND ADAPTABLE. THE SOONER WE BECOME AWARE OF THIS THE BETTER. THE EASIER IT WILL BE TO ACCEPT AND ADAPT TO WHAT DOES HAPPEN.

TRAIN TO LET GO OF WHAT'S NOT YOURS

"WHENEVER YOU EXPERIENCE THE PANGS OF LOSING SOMETHING, DON'T TREAT IT LIKE A PART OF YOURSELF BUT AS A BREAKABLE GLASS, SO WHEN IT FALLS YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT AND WON'T BE TROUBLED. SO TOO, WHENEVER YOU KISS YOUR CHILD, SIBLING, OR FRIEND, DON'T LAYER ON TOP OF THE EXPERIENCE ALL THE THINGS YOU MIGHT WISH, BUT HOLD THEM BACK AND STOP THEM, JUST AS THOSE WHO RIDE BEHIND TRIUMPHANT GENERALS REMIND THEM THEY ARE MORTAL. IN THE SAME WAY, REMIND YOURSELF THAT YOUR PRECIOUS ONE ISN'T ONE OF YOUR POSSESSIONS, BUT SOMETHING GIVEN FOR NOW, NOT FOREVER... "
— EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.24.84–86

AT A ROMAN TRIUMPH, THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE THEIR EYES GLUED TO THE VICTORIOUS GENERAL AT THE FRONT—one of the most coveted spots during Roman times. ONLY A FEW WOULD NOTICE THE AIDE IN THE BACK, RIGHT BEHIND THE COMMANDER, WHISPERING INTO HIS EAR, "REMEMBER, THOU ART MORTAL." WHAT A REMINDER TO HEAR AT THE PEAK OF YOUR GLORY!

THE PLEASURE OF TUNING OUT THE NEGATIVE

"How satisfying it is to dismiss and block out any upsetting or foreign impression, and immediately to have peace in all things."
— MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 5.2

THE STOICS WERE MERCIFULLY SPARED THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD ENDIMIC TO TODAY'S SOCIETY. THEY HAD NO SOCIAL MEDIA, NO NEWSPAPERS, NO TELEVISION CHATTER TO RILE THEM UP. BUT EVEN BACK THEN, AN UNDISCIPLINED PERSON WOULD HAVE FOUND PLenty TO BE DISTRACTED AND UPSET BY.

PART OF THE STOIC MINDSET THEN WAS A SORT OF A CULTIVATED IGNORANCE. PUBLILIUS SYRUS'S EPIGRAM EXPRESSES IT WELL: "ALWAYS SHUN THAT WHICH MAKES YOU ANGRY." MEANING: TURN YOUR MIND AWAY FROM THE THINGS THAT PROVOKE IT. IF YOU FIND THAT DISCUSSING POLITICS AT THE DINER TABLE LEADS TO FIGHTING, WHY DO YOU KEEP BRINGING IT UP? IF YOUR SIBLING'S LIFE CHOICES BOTHER YOU, WHY DON'T YOU STOP PICKING AT THEM AND MAKING THEM YOUR CONCERN? THE SAME GOES FOR SO MANY OTHER SOURCES OF AGRIVATION.

IT IS NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS TO SHUT THEM OUT. INSTEAD, IT IS A SIGN OF STRONG WILL. TRY SAYING: "I KNOW THE REACTION I TYPICALLY TAKE IN THESE SITUATIONS, AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT THIS TIME." AND THEN FOLLOW IT WITH: "I'M ALSO GOING TO REMOVE THIS STIMULUS FROM MY LIFE IN THE FUTURE AS WELL."

BECAUSE WHAT FOLLOWS IS PEACE AND SERENITY.
