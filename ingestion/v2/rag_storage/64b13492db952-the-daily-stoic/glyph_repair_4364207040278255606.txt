Here is the repaired text:

So, we must throw them out. He also says that “everything turns on our assumptions” (12.22), and we should hold our power for understanding, or forming opinions, sacred (3.9). The term appears eight times in Epictetus’s *Discourses* (see 2.19.13–14, where he says we hold opinions the opposite of what we should) and three times in the *Enchiridion* (see 20, where he talks about how our own opinions or assumptions are what fuel anger).

*Kalos* (καλός): beautiful; in the moral sense, noble, virtuous. Seneca’s equivalent term, used quite frequently, is *honestum*.

*Katalêpsis* (κατάληψις): true comprehension, clear perception, and firm conviction needed for right conduct. Hadot translates the term as “perception” or “objective representation.” This is a prominent term for Epictetus and stands in contrast to the Skeptic’s notion that nothing could be known with certainty (ἀκαταληπτος). Epictetus says that true progress (*prokopê*) is about giving assent (see *synkatathesis*) only where there is *katalêpsis* (Discourses 3.8.4). Marcus uses the term in praising the character of Antoninus and his zeal for “getting a true grasp of affairs” (6.30.2), as well as in 4.22, where he says every impulse should be subject to the claims of justice and keeping our convictions clear.

*Kathêkon* (καθῆκον): duty, appropriate action on the path to virtue. Diogenes Laertius says that Zeno was the first philosopher to use the term as relating to conduct in the sense of being incumbent upon an actor (*Lives of the Eminent Philosophers*, “Zeno,” 7.108). Marcus says that every duty in life is a sum of acts that deserve methodical attention (6.26).

*Koinos* (κοινός): common, shared in common. As Haines noted, this term and its cognates appear more than eighty times in Marcus, and it is a very central part of his thinking and ethical orientation. Community, partnership, fellowship, neighborliness, and cooperation are all heavily emphasized in terms ranging from *κοινωνία* (5.16, and “action for the common good in the present moment” in 9.6) to his own coined word *κοινονοημοσύνη*, regard for the feelings of others (1.16). In 6.30, Marcus tells us, “Life is short—the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good.” See also his morning ritual to remind ourselves that we’ve “been made by nature for the purpose of working with others” (8.12). A related common term appearing in both Marcus and Epictetus is the word ἀλλήλων / allêlôn, which stresses how we are “for each other” or “for one another” (twenty-six times in Marcus, especially 5.16 and 6.38; and twenty times in Epictetus, notably 2.20).

*Kosmos* (κόσμος): all-encompassing order, world, universe.

*Logos/Logikos* (λόγος/λογικός): reason or rational; the ordering principle of the cosmos. *Logos spermatikos* (λόγος σπερματικός) is the generative principle of the universe, which creates and takes back all things (see Marcus 6.24).

*Nomos* (νόμος): law, custom.

*Oiêsis* (οἴησις): conceit, self-deception, illusion, arrogant opinion or notion. Epictetus says (3.14.8) that two things must be rooted out of every human being: self-deception and mistrust/timidity (apistia). Our conceit, arrogance, and false opinions are what must be removed (2.6), often referred to as the *hamartia* or *apotynchanô*. Ousia (*οὐσία*): substance or being, sometimes used interchangeably with *hulê* (matter, material). Marcus speaks vividly of substance being “like a river’s unending flow, its activities constantly changing and causes infinitely shifting so that almost nothing at all stands still” (5.23), harking back to Heraclitus (Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 9.8).

*Paideia* (παιδεία): training, teaching, and education. Askeô, manthanô, and meletaô (see chart) are each a part of getting an education as outlined by Epictetus in *Discourses* 2.9.13–14. The daily disciplines are central to being educated for the Stoic, and only the educated are truly free (2.1.21–23 and 1.22.9–10a). Working over our preconceptions (*prolêpsin*) is the point of education (1.2.5–7).

*Pathos* (πάθος): passion or emotion, often excessive and based on false judgments. Haines places passion as the “affect” following from *hormê* that lead to acts against nature. The four passions divide into two types: (1) for things not in present possession or anticipated in the future, which are desire (ἐπιθυμία) and fear (φόβος); and (2) for things presently engaging a person, which are pleasure (ἡδονή) and distress (λύπη). Epictetus states the Stoic position most clearly in *Discourses* 4.1.175: “Freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but by removing your desire.” Diogenes Laertius says that Zeno defined passion/emotion as an irrational and unnatural movement in the soul, or as excessive *hormê* (Lives of the Eminent Philosophers 7.110). Despite the popular misconception, the Stoics did celebrate certain passions as good (*eupatheia*), if in rational bounds: in particular, joy, caution, and wishing (Lives of the Eminent Philosophers 7.116).

*Phantasia* (φαντασία): impression, appearance, perception. Epictetus says (1.1.7–9) that the gods gave us one power that governs all the rest—“the ability to make the right use of appearances.” He also says that the first and greatest task of the philosopher is to test (*δοκιμάζω, “to assay”) and separate appearances (see also 2.18.24). He uses the metaphors of sweeping currents, battle, and the rigorous training of an athlete for the work we must do to hold our own against impressions (2.18.27–28). “The task of the good and excellent person is to handle their impressions in harmony with nature” (3.3.1). There are more than two hundred references to *phantasia* in the *Discourses* and nine in the *Enchiridion* (34). The term appears about forty times in Marcus’s *Meditations* (5.2, 5.16, 6.13, 8.7, 8.26, 8.28–29). Marcus has a great exercise for not
