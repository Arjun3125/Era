To wish for what has happened to happen is a clever way to avoid disappointment because nothing is contrary to your desires. But to actually feel gratitude for what happens? To love it? That’s a recipe for happiness and joy.

BINDING OUR WISHES TO WHAT WILL BE

"But I haven't at any time been hindered in my will, nor forced against it. And how is this possible? I have bound up my choice to act with the will of God. God wills that I be sick, such is my will. He wills that I should choose something, so do I. He wills that I reach for something, or something be given to me—I wish for the same. What God doesn't will, I do not wish for."

EPICITUUS,
DISCOURSES
, 4.1.89

In a time when General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote to his wife on the eve of the invasion of Normandy, he told her, "Everything we could think of has been done; the troops are fit, everybody is doing his best. The answer is in the lap of the gods." He’d done everything he could—and now, what would happen would happen and as Epictetus might say, he was ready to bear whatever that was. In fact, Eisenhower had written another letter that night and prepared it for release in case the invasion failed. If failure was what God—or fate or luck—or whatever you want to call it—willed, he was ready.

There is a wonderful lesson there. The man in charge of perhaps the most powerful army the world had ever assembled, on the eve of the most expertly organized and planned invasion the world will hopefully ever know, was humble enough to know that the outcome ultimately belonged to someone or something bigger than him.

And so it goes with all our ventures. No matter how much preparation, no matter how skilled or smart we are, the ultimate outcome is in the lap of the gods. The sooner we know that, the better we will be.

FOLLOWING THE DOCTOR’S ORDERS

"Just as we commonly hear people say the doctor prescribed someone particular riding exercises, or ice baths, or walking without shoes, we should in the same way say that nature prescribed someone to be diseased, or disabled, or to suffer any kind of impairment. In the case of the doctor, prescribed means something ordered to help aid someone's healing. But in the case of nature, it means that what happens to each of us is ordered to help aid our destiny."

MARCUS
AURELIUS,
MEDITATIONS
, 5.8.

The Stoics were masters at analogies and used them as a tool to help strengthen their reasoning. Here, Marcus observes how willingly we will put up with unpleasantness if commanded to by the magic words "doctor's orders." The doctor says you've got to take this nasty medicine, and you'll do it. The doctor tells you you have to start sleeping hanging upside down like a bat. You'll feel silly, but soon enough you'll get to dangling because you think it will make you better.

On the other hand, when it comes to external events, we fight like hell if anything happens contrary to our plans. But what if, Marcus asks, a doctor had prescribed this exact thing as part of our treatment? What if this was as good for us as medicine?

Well, what if?

NOT GOOD, NOR BAD

"There is no evil in things changing, just as there is no good in persisting in a new state."

MARCUS
AURELIUS,
MEDITATIONS
, 4.42

When people say change is good, they're usually trying to reassure someone (or themselves). Because instinctively we view change as bad—or at least we’re suspicious of it.

The Stoics want you to do away with those labels altogether. Change isn't good. The status quo isn't bad. They just are.

Remember, events are objective. It's only our opinion that says something is good or bad (and thus worth fighting against or fighting for). A better attitude? To decide to make the most of everything. But to do that you must first cease fighting.

A HIGHER POWER

"This is the very thing which makes up the virtue of the happy person and a well-flowing life—when the affairs of life are in every way tuned to the harmony between the individual divine spirit and the will of the director of the universe."

CHRYSIPPUS, QUOTED IN
DIOGENES
LAERTIUS,
LIVES OF THE EMINENT PHILOSOPHERS, 7.1.88

Undergoing a twelve-step program, many addicts struggle most with step two: acknowledging a higher power. Addicts often fight this one. At first they claim it’s because they’re atheists or because they don’t like religion or because they don’t understand why it matters.

But they later realize that this is just the addiction talking—it’s another form of selfishness and self-absorption. The actual language of the step is pretty easy to swallow: "[We] came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." Subsequent steps ask the addict to submit and let go.

The second step really has less to do with "god" than those other steps—the letting go. It’s about attuning to the universe and discarding the toxic idea that we’re at the center of it.

It’s no wonder that the Stoics are popular with those in twelve-step programs. It’s also clear that this wisdom is beneficial to us all. You don’t have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop thinking you control everything. No amount of prosperity, no amount of difficulty, is certain or forever. A triumph becomes a trial, a trial becomes a triumph. Life can change in an instant. Remember, how often it does.

HOW TO BE POWERFUL

"Don't trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the strength that is yours—namely, your judgments about the things that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes us free and unfettered, that picks us up by the neck from the depths and lifts us eye to eye with the rich and powerful."

EPICITUUS,
DISCOURSES
, 3.26.34–35

In a scene in Steven Pressfield’s classic novel about Alexander the Great, 
The Virtues of War
, Alexander reaches a river crossing only to be confronted by a philosopher who refuses to move. "This man has conquered the world!" one of Alexander's men shouts. "What have you done?" The philosopher responds, with complete confidence, "I have conquered the need to conquer the world."

We do know that Alexander did clash with Diogenes the Cynic, a philosopher known for his rejection of what society prizes and, by extension, Alexander’s self-image. Just as in Pressfield’s fictional encounter, in Diogenes's real confrontation with Alexander, the philosopher was more powerful than the most powerful man in the world—because, unlike him, Diogenes had fewer wants. They were able to look each other in the eye and see who
