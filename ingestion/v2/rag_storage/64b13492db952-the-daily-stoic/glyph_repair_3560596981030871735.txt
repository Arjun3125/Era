TEXT:
I.2

Have you had a bad couple of weeks? Have you been drifting away from the principles and beliefs that you hold dear? It's perfectly fine. It happens to all of us.

In fact, it probably happened to Marcus—that may be why he scribbled this note to himself. Perhaps he'd been dealing with difficult senators or having difficulties with his troubled son. Perhaps in these scenarios he'd lost his temper, become depressed, or stopped checking in with himself. Who wouldn't?

But the reminder here is that no matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in the past, the principles themselves remain unchanged. We can return and embrace them at any moment. What happened yesterday—what happened five minutes ago—is the past. We can reignite and restart whenever we like.

Why not do it right now?

A MORNING RITUAL

“Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning:

What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion?
What for tranquility?
What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None of these things.
What, then? A rational being.
What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions.
How did I steer away from serenity?
What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?
What did I fail to do in all these things?”

EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.6.34–35

Any successful people have a morning ritual. For some, it’s meditation. For others, it’s exercise. For many, it’s journaling—just a few pages where they write down their thoughts, fears, hopes. In these cases, the point is not so much the activity itself as it is the ritualized reflection. The idea is to take some time to look inward and examine.

Taking that time is what Stoics advocated more than almost anything else. We don’t know whether Marcus Aurelius wrote his Meditations in the morning or at night, but we know he carved out moments of quiet alone time—and that he wrote for himself, not for anyone else. If you’re looking for a place to start your own ritual, you could do worse than Marcus’s example and Epictetus’s checklist.

Every day, starting today, ask yourself these same tough questions. Let philosophy and hard work guide you to better answers, one morning at a time, over the course of a life.

THE DAY IN REVIEW

“I will keep constant watch over myself—and—most usefully—will put each day up for review.
For this is what makes us evil—that none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon
only that which we are about to do. And yet, our plans for the future descend from the past.”

SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 83.2

In a letter to his older brother Novatus, Seneca describes a beneficial exercise he borrowed from another prominent philosopher. At the end of each day he would ask himself variations of the following questions:

What bad habit did I curb today? How am I better? Were my actions just? How can I improve?

At the beginning or end of each day, the Stoic sits down with his journal and reviews: what he did, what he thought, what could be improved. It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a somewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit. Writing down Stoic exercises was and is also a form of practicing them, just as repeating a prayer or hymn might be.

Keep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little notebook. Take time to consciously recall the events of the previous day. Be unflinching in your assessments. Notice what contributed to your happiness and what detracted from it. Write down what you’d like to work on or quotes that you like. By making the effort to record such thoughts, you’re less likely to forget them. An added bonus: you’ll have a running tally to track your progress too.

THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY

“Let’s pass over to the really rich—how often the occasions they look just like the poor! When
they travel abroad they must restrict their baggage, and when haste is necessary, they dismiss
their entourage. And those who are in the army, how few of their possessions they get to
keep...”

SENECA, ON CONSOLATION TO HELVIA, 12.1. b–2

The author F. Scott Fitzgerald, who often glamorized the lifestyles of the rich and famous in books like The Great Gatsby, opens one of his short stories with the now-classic lines: “Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.” A few years after this story was published, his friend Ernest Hemingway teased Fitzgerald by writing, “Yes, they have more money.”

That’s what Seneca is reminding us. As someone who was one of the richest men in Rome, he knew firsthand that money only marginally changes life. It doesn’t solve the problems that people without it seem to think it will. In fact, no material possession will. External things can’t fix internal issues.

We constantly forget this—and it causes us so much confusion and pain. As Hemingway would later write of Fitzgerald, “He thought [the rich] were cheap. It’s because the things that matter to them are not wealth or possessions.” Instead, they value simplicity, self-sufficiency, and contentment—values that can be found regardless of one’s financial situation.

THE ONLY PRIZE

“What’s left to be prized? This, I think—to limit our action or inaction to only what’s in keeping with the needs of our own preparation... it’s what the exertions of education and teaching are all about—here is the thing to be prized! If you hold this firmly, you’ll stop trying to get yourself all the other things... If you don’t, you won’t be free, self-sufficient, or liberated from passion, but necessarily full of envy, jealousy, and suspicion for any who have the power to take them, and you’ll plot against those who do have what you prize. But by having some self-respect for your own mind and prizing it, you will please yourself and be in better harmony with your fellow human beings, and more in tune with the gods—praising everything they have set in order and allotted you.”

MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.16.2

Bill Gates, whose net worth is approximately $84 billion, lives in a modest house in Seattle. Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors, still lives on a budget. These examples demonstrate that the things that matter are not wealth or possessions but values like self-respect, contentment, and gratitude—values that can be found regardless of one’s financial situation.

In conclusion, these excerpts from Marcus Aurelius's Meditations provide valuable insights into cultivating a life of virtue, mindfulness, and simplicity. By adopting a morning ritual, reflecting on our actions and intentions daily, and focusing on what truly matters in life, we can achieve a deeper sense of fulfillment and contentment—values that are more important than material wealth or possessions.
