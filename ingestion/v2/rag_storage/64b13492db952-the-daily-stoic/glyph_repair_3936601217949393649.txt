**May 25th: WHERE TO FIND JOY**

"Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper human work consists of: acts of kindness to other human beings, disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it."

— Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 8.26

When dog trainers are brought in to work with a dysfunctional or unhappy dog, they usually start with one question: "Do you take it for walks?" They ask because dogs were bred to do certain tasks—they were bred to do work—and when deprived of this essential part of their nature, they suffer and act out. This is true no matter how spoiled and nice their life might be.

The same is true for humans. When you hear the Stoics brush aside certain emotions or material luxuries, it's not because they don't enjoy them. It's not because the Stoic life is one bereft of happiness or fun. The Stoics simply mean to help us find our essence—to experience the joy of our proper human work.

**May 26th: STOP CAREING WHAT PEOPLE THINK**

"I'm constantly amazed by how easily we love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock in the opinions of others than in our own estimation of self. . . . How much credence we give to the opinions our peers have of us and how little to our very own!"

— Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 12.4

How quickly we can disregard our own feelings about something and adopt someone else's. We think a shirt looks good at the store but will view it with shame and scorn if our spouse or a coworker makes an offhand remark. We can be immensely happy with our own lives—until we find out that someone we don't even like has more. Or worse and more precariously, we don't feel good about our accomplishments or talents until some third party validates them.

Like most Stoic exercises, this one attempts to teach us that although we control our own opinions, we don’t control what other people think—about us least of all. For this reason, putting ourselves at the mercy of those opinions and trying to gain the approval of others are a dangerous endeavor.

Don't spend much time thinking about what other people think. Think about what **you** think. Think instead about the results, about the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do.

**May 27th: SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF**

"Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing."

— Zeno, quoted in *Diogenes Laertius*, *Lives of the Eminent Philosophers*, 7.1.26

The famous biographer Diogenes Laertius attributes this quote to Zeno but admits that it might have also been said by Socrates, meaning that it may be a quote of a quote of a quote. But does it really matter? Truth is truth.

In this case, the truth is one we know well: the little things add up. Someone is a good person not because they say they are, but because they take good actions. One doesn’t magically get one’s act together—it is a matter of many individual choices. It’s a matter of getting up at the right time, making your bed, resisting shortcuts, investing in yourself, doing your work. And make no mistake: while the individual action is small, its cumulative impact is not.

Think about all the small choices that will roll themselves out in front of you today. Do you know which are the right way and which are the easy way? Choose the right way, and watch as all these little things add up toward transformation.

**May 28th: THE FIRST TWO THINGS BEFORE ACTING**

"The first thing to do—don’t get worked up. For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now. The next thing to do—consider carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting—with kindness, modesty, and sincerity."

— Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 8.5

Imagine, for a second, what Marcus’s life as an emperor must have been like. He would preside over the Senate. He would lead the troops in battle, direct the grand strategy of the army as its highest commander. He would also hear appeals—from citizens, from lawyers, from foreign governments. In other words, like most people in power, he was called on to make decisions: all day, every day, decision after decision.

His formula for decision making is a battle-tested method for doing and acting right—literally. Which is why we ought to try to use it ourselves.

First, don’t get upset—because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it needs to be.

Second, remember the purpose and principles you value most. Running potential actions through this filter will eliminate the bad choices and highlight the right ones.

Don't get upset.

Do the right thing.

That’s it.

**May 29th: WORK IS THERAPY**

"Work nourishes noble minds."

— Seneca, *Moral Letters*, 31.5

You know that feeling you get when you haven’t been to the gym in a few days? A bit doughy. Irritable. Claustrophobic. Uncertain. Others get a similar frustration when they’ve been on vacation for too long or right after they first retire. The mind and the body are there to be used—they begin to turn on themselves when not put to some productive end.

It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people. They leave so much of their potential unfulfilled because they have jobs where they don’t really do much or because they have too much time on their hands. Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama—indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment.

The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.

**May 30th: WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?**

"I can’t call a person a hard worker just because I hear they read and write, even if working at it all night. Until I know what a person is working for, I can’t deem them industrious. . . . I can if the end they work for is their own ruling principle, having it be and remain in constant harmony with Nature."

— Epictetus, *Discourses*, 4.4.41; 43

What are the chances that the busiest person you know is actually the most productive? We tend to associate busyness with goodness and believe that spending many hours at work should be rewarded.

Instead, evaluate what **you** are doing, why **you** are doing it, and where accomplishing it will take you. If you don’t have a good answer, then stop.

**May 31st: WE HAVE BUT ONE OBLIGATION**

"What is your vocation? To be a good person."

— Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 11.5

The Stoics believed, above all else, that our job on this earth is to be a good human being. It is a basic duty, yet we are experts at coming up with excuses for avoiding it.

To quote Belichick again: "Do your job."

**June: PROBLEM SOLVING**

**June 1st: ALWAYS HAVE A MENTAL REVERSE CLAUSE**

"Indeed, no one can thwart the purposes of your mind—for they can’t be touched by fire, steel, tyranny, slander, or anything."

— Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 8.41

Obstacles are a part of life—things happen, stuff gets in our way, situations go awry. But nothing can stop the Stoic mind when it’s operating properly, because in every course of action, it has retained “a reverse clause.”

What’s that? It’s a backup option. If a friend betrays us, our reverse clause is to learn from how this happened and how to forgive this person more easily next time.

We don't have to let others' actions dictate our reactions. We can choose to respond with resilience and wisdom.
