**A Model of Late Stoic Practice and Glossary of Key Terms and Passages**

Stoic thought of the second century, as articulated in the writings of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, paints a vivid picture of the work of philosophy in producing both self-coherence and progress on the path to virtue. As suggested in the work of Pierre Hadot and A.A. Long (see Suggestions for Further Reading), we have developed and formalized Epictetus’s three disciplines into a chart that presents the progressive nature of the late Stoic prescription for handling ourselves and our actions in the world. This chart brings together the three topoi (topics, or fields of study) and three different levels of training (askêsis) suggested by Epictetus and shows how they correlate (noted in Hadot) to the pursuit of virtue as expressed by Marcus Aurelius. The chart itself comes from these key passages in Epictetus:

"There are three areas in which the person who would be wise and good must be trained. The first has to do with desires and aversions—that a person may never miss the mark in desires nor fall into what repels them. The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more broadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The third has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the assent our mind gives to its perceptions."

—EPICETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.2.1–3

"That’s why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should."

—EPICETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.9.13–14

We have placed key terms in each level of the chart. There is progress (prokopê) upward out of deception, false opinion, and error—through impulse control—to more clear judgments and knowledge (self-coherence); and there is progress across the levels of training (study/manthanô, practice/meletaô, hard training/askeô) through the remediation of habit, acting more appropriately, and improving judgment toward living the virtues. We offer an annotated glossary of key Stoic terms and passages following the chart.

**Adiaphora (ἀδιάφορα): Indifferent Things; Neither Good Nor Bad in an Absolute Moral Sense**

In Stoic thought, all things outside our sphere of reasoned choice (see prohairesis) are indifferent. In a relative sense, some of the things outside our control are preferred or dispreferred goods (proêgmena / aproêgmena). Marcus says (5.20) that people who thwart the progress of our reasoned choice, although normally our natural concern, also become indifferent to us. The term appears in Epictetus’s Discourses seventeen times and once in Enchiridion; see Discourses 2.19.12b–13 and 3.3.1. In Marcus it appears six times; see also 8.56 (my prohairesis is indifferent to that of others, and vice versa).

**Agathos (ἀγαθός): Good, or a Proper Object of Desire**

Epictetus upholds the classic Stoic position when he says that the good (and evil) are only to be found in us, in our prohairesis, not in external things (Discourses 2.16.1), and when he says, "God laid down this law, saying: if you want some good, get it from yourself" (1.29.4). "Protect your own good in all that you do" (4.3.11).

**Anthrôpos (ἄνθρωπος): Human Being**

Hadot notes that the four cardinal virtues of Plato are not fully present in Arrian’s presentation of Epictetus (The Inner Citadel, p. 238), but that in Marcus, who followed Epictetus closely, they have a clear articulation and correlation to what Hadot calls "the three acts of the soul" (see chart). Diogenes Laertius says that the four cardinal virtues were primary for the Stoics (Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, “Zeno,” 7.92b): σωφροσύνη/self-control, δικαιοσύνη/justice, ἀνδρεία/courage, φρόνησις/wisdom. Chrysippus said that experiencing wisdom (phronimos) for even a moment is equal to an eternity of exercising aretê (Plutarch, Moralia 1062). Musonius Rufus said, "The human being is born with an inclination toward virtue" (Lectures 1.7.1–2). Marcus mentions all four virtues in 3.6.1 and 5.12, and three (without courage) in 7.63, 8.32, and 12.15. We present them here as the aims of moral progress to which all our activity in the world is directed. Marcus says we should let our virtues shine until we are extinguished (12.15). Epictetus does cite justice and self-control together in his discussion
