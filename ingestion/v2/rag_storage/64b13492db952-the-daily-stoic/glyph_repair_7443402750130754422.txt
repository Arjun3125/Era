"You must build up your life action by action, and be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible—and no one can keep you from this. But there will be some external obstacle! Perhaps, but no obstacle to acting with justice, self-control, and wisdom. But what if some other area of my action is thwarted? Well, gladly accept the obstacle for what it is and shift your attention to what is given, and another action will immediately take its place, one that better fits the life you are building."

**MARCUS AURELIUS**, **MEDITATIONS**, 8.32

**lite athletes in collegiate and professional sports increasingly follow a philosophy known as "The Process." It’s a philosophy created by University of Alabama coach Nick Saban, who taught his players to ignore the big picture—important games, winning championships, the opponent’s enormous lead—and focus instead on doing the absolutely smallest things well—practicing with full effort, finishing a specific play, converting on a single possession. A season lasts months, a game lasts hours, catching up might be four touchdowns away, but a single play is only a few seconds. And games and seasons are constituted by seconds. If teams follow The Process, they tend to win. They overcome obstacles and eventually make their way to the top without ever having focused on the obstacles directly. If you follow The Process in your life—assembling the right actions in the right order, one right after another—you too will do well. Not only that, you will be better equipped to make quick work of the obstacles along that path. You’ll be too busy putting one foot in front of the next to even notice the obstacles were there."

"SOLVE PROBLEMS EARLY"
"There is no vice which lacks a defense, none that at the outset isn’t modest and easily intervened—but after this the trouble spreads widely. If you allow it to get started you won’t be able to control when it stops. Every emotion is at first weak. Later it rouses itself and gathers strength as it moves along—it’s easier to slow it down than to supplant it."

**SENECA**, **MORAL LETTERS**, 106.2

**ivers,” Publilius Syrus reminds us with an epigram, “are easiest to cross at their source.” That's what Seneca means too. The raging waters and deadly currents of bad habits, ill discipline, chaos, and dysfunction—somewhere they began as no more than just a slight trickle. Somewhere they are a placid lake or pond, even a bubbling underground spring.

Which would you rather do—nearly drown in a dangerous crossing in a few weeks or cross now while it’s still easy? It's up to you.

"YOU CAN DO IT"
"If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don’t imagine it impossible—for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you."

**MARCUS AURELIUS**, **MEDITATIONS**, 6.19

Here are two kinds of people in this world. The first looks at others who have accomplished things and thinks: Why them? Why not me? The other looks at those same people and thinks: If they can do it, why can’t I? One is zero-sum and jealous (if you win, I lose). The other is non-zero-sum (there’s plenty to go around) and sees the success of others as an inspiration.

Which attitude will propel you onward and upward? Which will drive you to bitterness and despair? Who will you be?

"JUST DON’T MAKE THINGS WORSE"
"How much more harmful are the consequences of anger and grief than the circumstances that aroused them in us!"

**MARCUS AURELIUS**, **MEDITATIONS**, 11.18.8

He first rule of holes, goes the adage, is that “if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.” This might be the most violated piece of commonsense wisdom in the world. Because what most of us do when something happens, goes wrong, or is inflicted on us is make it worse—first, by getting angry or feeling aggrieved, and next, by flailing around before we have much in the way of a plan.

Today, give yourself the most simple and doable of tasks: just don’t make stuff worse. Whatever happens, don’t add angry or negative emotions to the equation. Don’t react for the sake of reacting. Leave it as it is. Stop digging. Then plan your way out.

"A TRAINED MIND IS BETTER THAN ANY SCRIPT"
"In this way you must understand how laughable it is to say, ‘Tell me what to do!’ What advice could I possibly give? No, a far better request is, ‘Train my mind to adapt to any circumstance.’ . . . In this way, if circumstances take you off script . . . you won’t be desperate for a new prompting."

**EPICTETUS**, **DISCOURSES**, 2.2.20b–1; 24b–25a

It would be nice if someone could show us exactly what to do in every situation. Indeed, this is what we spend a good portion of our lives doing: preparing for this, studying for that. Saving for or anticipating some arbitrary point in the future. But plans, as the boxer Mike Tyson pointed out, last only until you’re punched in the face.

Stoics do not teach one to ignore problems, but rather to cope with them rationally. They believe that we should focus on what we can control and let go of the rest. So, if a situation arises that is outside our control, we must accept it as an obstacle to be overcome, rather than allowing it to define us.

"CONQUER THYSELF"
"The only thing you cannot control is your mind. Train it well and it will serve you well."

**EPICTETUS**, **DISCOURSES**, 1.22

Conquering oneself involves developing self-control, which means being able to resist impulses and desires that could harm one's own wellbeing or the wellbeing of others.

One way to develop self-control is through mindfulness meditation. By focusing on the present moment and observing your thoughts and emotions without judgment, you can become more aware of what triggers your impulsive behaviors and learn how to respond in a more calm and rational manner.

Another important aspect of conquering oneself is setting realistic goals for yourself. When we set achievable goals, we are more likely to feel successful and satisfied with our progress, which in turn helps us stay motivated and focused on our self-improvement journey.

"TRY THE OTHER HANDLE"
"Every event has two handles—one by which it can be carried, and one by which it cannot. If your brother does you wrong, don’t grab it by his wrongdoing, because this is the handle incapable of lifting it. Instead, use the other—that he is your brother, that you were raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that carries."

**EPICTETUS**, **ENCHIRIDION**, 43

The famous journalist William Seabrook suffered from such debilitating alcoholism that in 1933 he committed himself to an insane asylum, which was then the only place to get treatment for addiction. In his memoir, *Asylum*, he tells the story of the struggle to turn his life around inside the facility.

At first, he stuck to his addict's way of thinking—and as a result, he was an outsider, constantly getting in trouble and rebelling against the staff. He made almost no progress and was on the verge of being asked to leave. Then one day this very quote from Epictetus—about everything having two handles—occurred to him.

“I took hold now by the other handle,” he related later, “and carried on.” He actually began to have a new sense of purpose and direction. Over time, he overcame his addiction and went on to become a successful author and journalist. His experience serves as a powerful reminder that it is never too late to change our lives—and that we always have the power to take control of our thoughts and actions.

So remember, when faced with a difficult situation or temptation, try the other handle. Focus on the positive aspects of the situation and use your knowledge and wisdom to guide you towards the right course of action. By doing so, you can overcome obstacles and achieve success in your personal and professional life."
