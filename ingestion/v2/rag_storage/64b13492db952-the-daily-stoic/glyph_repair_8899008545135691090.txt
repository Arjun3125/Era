telling yourself more than initial impressions ("report" in 8.49). Phronêsis (φρόνησις): practical wisdom, one of the four cardinal virtues. The term is used repeatedly by Marcus, most memorably in 4.37, where he says that "wisdom and acting justly are one and the same," and in 5.9, where he says "there is nothing so pleasing as wisdom itself." See arête.

Physis (φύσις): nature, the natural order; of things, species, or kind: characteristic. Both Epictetus and Marcus repeatedly state that we must use our ruling principle to keep ourselves in harmony with nature (Discourses 4.4.43; Marcus 3.9). In Stoic thought, God and nature are one.

Pneuma (πνεῦμα): air, breath, spirit; a principle in Stoic physics. The part of the soul set into disturbance by desires and aversions, which Haines calls the inferior part of the soul, distinct from nous (mind). Epictetus has a memorable image in Discourses 3.3.20–22, where he talks about the movement of a disturbed bowl of water being like the spirit in which things exist.

Proêgmena (προηγμένα): preferred things; indifferent in an absolute moral sense, but of relative positive value, naturally desirable things, such as health. Opposite of aproêgmena.

Prohairesis (προαίρεσις): reasoned or deliberative choice, our free will to choose, the sphere of choice. The term goes back to Aristotle's Ethics and has been traditionally translated there as "purposive choice." A. A. Long, in an attempt to free it from modern moral concepts, translates it as "volition," a term we find too remote from everyday understanding—for generations prior it was translated as "moral purpose" (W. A. Oldfather, George Long, and others). We are avoiding loading the term with either the moral sense of Christian tradition or the modernist sense of will, heavily colored since Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. A. A. Long sees this as Epictetus’s preferred term for what distinguishes human beings from animals (which also have hêgemonikon in his reading of Epictetus; Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life, p. 211), something not even the gods can touch (Discourses 1.1.23). The term is used sixty-nine times in the Discourses (1.4.18–22, 1.18.21–23, 1.22.10, 1.29.1–4a, 2.1.12–13, 2.5.4–5, 2.6.25, 2.10.1, 2.16.1–2a, 2.22.19–20, 3.1.39b–40a, 3.3.18–19, 3.7.5, 3.10.18, 3.19.2–3, 3.21.1–3, 3.22.13, 4.4.23, 4.5.34–37) and six times in the Enchiridion (13). Marcus uses it five times in the negative (ἀπροαίρετα), or outside of our choice, and three times in the positive sense of deliberate choice (3.6, 6.41, 8.56, 12.3, 12.33). Where this is the focal point of Epictetus’s system, Marcus leans heavily to hêgemonikon.

Prokopê (προκόπη): progress, advance. The process by which one makes progress or advancement in a particular field. Procopês can refer to personal growth, professional development, or any form of advancement in life.

Pronos (πρόνος): forecast, prediction. A prediction or forecast made about future events or developments. Pronoi is often used in the context of divination or prophecy, where someone makes a prediction based on omens or signs.

Pronoskopêsis (προνοσκοπήσις): surveying or examining with foreknowledge. The practice of surveying or examining something with the knowledge that one will be able to predict or forecast future events or developments. Pronoskopês is often used in the context of divination or prophecy, where someone surveys or examines something with the ability to predict or forecast future events.

Pronostikêsis (προνόστικήσεως): divination or prediction. The practice of divination or predicting future events or developments. Pronostikêsis is often associated with fortune-telling, augury, and other forms of divination.

Pronosis (πρόνοσης): foreknowledge or prescience. The ability to know future events or developments before they occur. Pronosis is often associated with prophecy, divination, and other forms of foreknowledge.
