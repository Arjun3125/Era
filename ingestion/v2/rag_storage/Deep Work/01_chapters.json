    "raw_text": "Introduction\nIn the Swiss canton of St. Gallen, near the northern banks of Lake Zurich, is a village\nnamed Bollingen. In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building\na retreat. He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower. After\nreturning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation\nrooms to homes, he expanded the complex to include a private office. “In my retiring\nroom I am by myself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no\none else is allowed in there except with my permission.”\nIn his book \nDaily Rituals\n, journalist Mason Currey sorted through various sources\non Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the Tower. Jung would rise at\nseven a.m., Currey reports, and after a big breakfast he would spend two hours of\nundistracted writing time in his private office. His afternoons would often consist of\nmeditation or long walks in the surrounding countryside. There was no electricity at\nthe Tower, so as day gave way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the\nfireplace. Jung would retire \nto bed by ten p.m. “The feeling of repose and renewal that\nI had in this tower was intense from the start,” he said.\nThough it’s tempting to think of Bollingen Tower as a vacation home, if we put it\ninto the context of Jung’s career at this point it’s clear that the lakeside retreat was not\nbuilt as an escape from work. In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not\nafford to take a vacation. Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published\nPsychological Types\n, a seminal book that solidified many differences that had been\nlong developing between Jung’s thinking and the ideas of his onetime friend and\nmentor, Sigmund Freud. To disagree with Freud in the 1920s was a bold move. To\nback up his book, Jung needed to stay sharp and produce a stream of smart articles and\nbooks further supporting and establishing \nanalytical psychology\n, the eventual name\nfor his new school of thought.\nJung’s lectures and counseling practice kept him busy in Zurich—this is clear. But\nhe wasn’t satisfied with busyness alone. He wanted to change the way we understood\nthe unconscious, and this goal required deeper, more careful thought than he could\nmanage amid his hectic city lifestyle. Jung retreated to Bollingen, not to escape his\nprofessional life, but instead to advance it."

    "raw_text": "Carl Jung went on to become one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth\ncentury. There are, of course, many reasons for his eventual success. In this book,\nhowever, I’m interested in his commitment to the following skill, which almost\ncertainly played a key role in his accomplishments:\nDeep Work:\n Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your\ncognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to\nreplicate.\nDeep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current\nintellectual capacity. We now know from decades of research in both psychology and\nneuroscience that the state of mental strain that accompanies deep work is also\nnecessary to improve your abilities. Deep work, in other words, was exactly the type\nof effort needed to stand out in a cognitively demanding field like academic psychiatry\nin the early twentieth century.\nThe term “deep work” is my own and is not something Carl Jung would have used,\nbut his actions during this period were those of someone who understood the\nunderlying concept. Jung built a tower out of stone in the woods to promote deep work\nin his professional life—a task that required time, energy, and money. It also took him\naway from more immediate pursuits. As Mason Currey writes, Jung’s regular journeys\nto Bollingen reduced the time he spent on his clinical work, noting, “Although he had\nmany patients who relied on him, Jung was not shy about taking time off.” Deep work,\nthough a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of changing the world.\nIndeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and\nrecent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme. The\nsixteenth-century essayist Michel de Montaigne, for example, prefigured \nJung by\nworking in a private library he built in the southern tower guarding the stone walls of\nhis French château, while Mark Twain wrote much of \nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\nin a shed on the property of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the\nsummer. Twain’s study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to\nblowing a horn to attract his attention for meals.\nMoving forward in history, consider the screenwriter and director Woody Allen. In\nthe forty-four-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed\nforty-four films that received twenty-three Academy Award nominations—an absurd\nrate of artistic productivity. Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer,\ninstead completing all his writing, free from electronic distraction, on a German\nOlympia SM3 manual typewriter. Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by\nPeter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who performs his work in such disconnected\n\f\nisolation that journalists couldn’t find him after it was announced he had won the\nNobel Prize. J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, \ndoes\n use a computer, but was famously\nabsent from social media during the writing of her Harry Potter novels—even though\nthis period coincided with the rise of the technology and its popularity among media\nfigures. Rowling’s staff finally started a Twitter account in her name in the fall of\n2009, as she was working on \nThe Casual Vacancy\n, and for the first year and a half her\nonly tweet read: “This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am\nafraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”\nDeep work, of course, is not limited to the historical \nor technophobic. Microsoft\nCEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he\nwould isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big\nthoughts. It was during a 1995 Think Week that Gates wrote his famous “Internet Tidal\nWave” memo that turned Microsoft’s attention to an upstart company called Netscape\nCommunications. And in an ironic twist, Neal Stephenson, the acclaimed cyberpunk\nauthor who helped form our popular conception of the Internet age, is near impossible\nto reach electronically—his website offers no e-mail address and features an essay\nabout why he is purposefully bad at using social media. Here’s how he once explained\nthe omission: “If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive,\nuninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what\nreplaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time… there is a bunch of\ne-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.”\nThe ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize\nbecause it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers\n—a group that’s rapidly forgetting the value of going deep.\nThe reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well\nestablished: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication\nservices like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and\nthe shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise\nof these tools, \ncombined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and\nnetworked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into\nslivers. A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends\nmore than 60 percent of the workweek engaged in electronic communication and\nInternet searching, with close to 30 percent of a worker’s time dedicated to reading\nand answering e-mail alone.\nThis state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires\nlong periods of uninterrupted thinking. At the same time, however, modern knowledge\n\f\nworkers are not loafing. In fact, they report that they are as busy as ever. What\nexplains the discrepancy? A lot can be explained by another type of effort, which\nprovides a counterpart to the idea of deep work:\nShallow Work:\n Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These\nefforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.\nIn an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly\nreplace deep work with the shallow alternative—constantly sending and receiving e-\nmail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of\ndistraction. Larger efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming\na new business strategy or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into\ndistracted dashes that produce muted quality. \nTo make matters worse for depth, there’s\nincreasing evidence that this shift toward the shallow is not a choice that can be easily\nreversed. Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you \npermanently\nreduce your capacity to perform deep work. “What the Net seems to be doing is\nchipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation,” admitted journalist\nNicholas Carr, in an oft-cited 2008 \nAtlantic\n article. “[And] I’m not the only one.”\nCarr expanded this argument into a book, \nThe Shallows\n, which became a finalist for\nthe Pulitzer Prize. To write \nThe Shallows\n, appropriately enough, Carr had to move to\na cabin and forcibly disconnect.\nThe idea that network tools are pushing our work from the deep toward the shallow\nis not new. \nThe Shallows\n was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the\nInternet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These subsequent titles include\nWilliam Powers’s \nHamlet’s BlackBerry\n, John Freeman’s \nThe Tyranny of E-mail\n, and\nAlex Soojung-Kin Pang’s \nThe Distraction Addiction\n—all of which agree, more or\nless, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken\nconcentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.\nGiven this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this book trying\nto establish this point. We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact\ndeep work. I’ll also sidestep any grand arguments about the long-term societal\nconsequence of this shift, as such arguments tend to open impassible rifts. On one side\nof the debate are techno-skeptics like Jaron Lanier and John \nFreeman, who suspect\nthat many of these tools, at least in their current state, damage society, while on the\nother side techno-optimists like Clive Thompson argue that they’re changing society,\nfor sure, but in ways that’ll make us better off. Google, for example, might reduce our\nmemory, but we no longer \nneed\n good memories, as in the moment we can now search\nfor anything we need to know.\n\f\nI have no stance in this philosophical debate. My interest in this matter instead\nveers toward a thesis of much more pragmatic and individualized interest: Our work\nculture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad)\nis exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize\nthe potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth—an opportunity that, not too\nlong ago, was leveraged by a bored young consultant from Virginia named Jason Benn.\nThere are many ways to discover that you’re not valuable in our economy. For Jason\nBenn the lesson was made clear when he realized, not long after taking a job as a\nfinancial consultant, that the vast majority of his work responsibilities could be\nautomated by a “kludged together” Excel script.\nThe firm that hired Benn produced reports for banks involved in complex deals.\n(“It was about as interesting as it sounds,” Benn joked in one of our interviews.) The\nreport creation process required hours of manual manipulation of data in a series of\nExcel spreadsheets. When he first arrived, it took Benn up to six hours per report to\nfinish this stage \n(the most efficient veterans at the firm could complete this task in\naround half the time). This didn’t sit well with Benn.\n“The way it was taught to me, the process seemed clunky and manually intensive,”\nBenn recalls. He knew that Excel has a feature called macros that allows users to\nautomate common tasks. Benn read articles on the topic and soon put together a new\nworksheet, wired up with a series of these macros that could take the six-hour process\nof manual data manipulation and replace it, essentially, with a button click. A report-\nwriting process that originally took him a full workday could now be reduced to less\nthan an hour.\nBenn is a smart guy. He graduated from an elite college (the University of Virginia)\nwith a degree in economics, and like many in his situation he had ambitions for his\ncareer. It didn’t take him long to realize that these ambitions would be thwarted so\nlong as his main professional skills could be captured in an Excel macro. He decided,\ntherefore, he needed to increase his value to the world. After a period of research,\nBenn reached a conclusion: He would, he declared to his family, quit his job as a\nhuman spreadsheet and become a computer programmer. As is often the case with such\ngrand plans, however, there was a hitch: Jason Benn had no idea how to write code.\nAs a computer scientist I can confirm an obvious point: Programming computers is\nhard. Most new developers dedicate a four-year college education to learning the\nropes before their first job—and even then, competition for the \nbest spots is fierce.\nJason Benn didn’t have this time. After his Excel epiphany, he quit his job at the\nfinancial firm and moved home to prepare for his next step. His parents were happy he"

    "raw_text": "had a plan, but they weren’t happy about the idea that this return home might be long-\nterm. Benn needed to learn a hard skill, and needed to do so \nfast\n.\nIt’s here that Benn ran into the same problem that holds back many knowledge\nworkers from navigating into more explosive career trajectories. Learning something\ncomplex like computer programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration on\ncognitively demanding concepts—the type of concentration that drove Carl Jung to the\nwoods surrounding Lake Zurich. This task, in other words, is an act of deep work.\nMost knowledge workers, however, as I argued earlier in this introduction, have lost\ntheir ability to perform deep work. Benn was no exception to this trend.\n“I was always getting on the Internet and checking my e-mail; I couldn’t stop\nmyself; it was a compulsion,” Benn said, describing himself during the period leading\nup to his quitting his finance job. To emphasize his difficulty with depth, Benn told me\nabout a project that a supervisor at the finance firm once brought to him. “They wanted\nme to write a business plan,” he explained. Benn didn’t know how to write a business\nplan, so he decided he would find and read five different existing plans—comparing\nand contrasting them to understand what was needed. This was a good idea, but Benn\nhad a problem: “I couldn’t stay focused.” There were days during this period, he now\nadmits, when he spent \nalmost every minute (“98 percent of my time”) surfing the Web.\nThe business plan project—a chance to distinguish himself early in his career—fell to\nthe wayside.\nBy the time he quit, Benn was well aware of his difficulties with deep work, so\nwhen he dedicated himself to learning how to code, he knew he had to simultaneously\nteach his mind how to go deep. His method was drastic but effective. “I locked myself\nin a room with no computer: just textbooks, notecards, and a highlighter.” He would\nhighlight the computer programming textbooks, transfer the ideas to notecards, and\nthen practice them out loud. These periods free from electronic distraction were hard\nat first, but Benn gave himself no other option: He \nhad\n to learn this material, and he\nmade sure there was nothing in that room to distract him. Over time, however, he got\nbetter at concentrating, eventually getting to a point where he was regularly clocking\nfive or more disconnected hours per day in the room, focused without distraction on\nlearning this hard new skill. “I probably read something like eighteen books on the\ntopic by the time I was done,” he recalls.\nAfter two months locked away studying, Benn attended the notoriously difficult\nDev Bootcamp: a hundred-hour-a-week crash course in Web application\nprogramming. (While researching the program, Benn found a student with a PhD from\nPrinceton who had described Dev as “the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”)\n\f\nGiven both his preparation and his newly honed ability for deep work, Benn excelled.\n“Some people show up not prepared,” he said. “They can’t focus. \nThey can’t learn\nquickly.” Only half the students who started the program with Benn ended up\ngraduating on time. Benn not only graduated, but was also the top student in his class.\nThe deep work paid off. Benn quickly landed a job as a developer at a San\nFrancisco tech start-up with $25 million in venture funding and its pick of employees.\nWhen Benn quit his job as a financial consultant, only half a year earlier, he was\nmaking $40,000 a year. His new job as a computer developer paid $100,000—an\namount that can continue to grow, essentially without limit in the Silicon Valley\nmarket, along with his skill level.\nWhen I last spoke with Benn, he was thriving in his new position. A newfound\ndevotee of deep work, he rented an apartment across the street from his office,\nallowing him to show up early in the morning before anyone else arrived and work\nwithout distraction. “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first\nmeeting,” he told me. “Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon. And I\ndo mean ‘focus’: no e-mail, no Hacker News [a website popular among tech types],\njust programming.” For someone who admitted to sometimes spending up to 98\npercent of his day in his old job surfing the Web, Jason Benn’s transformation is\nnothing short of astonishing.\nJason Benn’s story highlights a crucial lesson: Deep work is not some nostalgic\naffectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that\nhas great value today.\nThere are two reasons for this value. The first has to \ndo with learning. We have an\ninformation economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. Some\nof the computer languages Benn learned, for example, didn’t exist ten years ago and\nwill likely be outdated ten years from now. Similarly, someone coming up in the field\nof marketing in the 1990s probably had no idea that today they’d need to master digital\nanalytics. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of\nquickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t\ncultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.\nThe second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital\nnetwork revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, its reachable\naudience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless—which greatly\nmagnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is mediocre, then\nyou’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.\nWhether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur,\n\f\nyour situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying\nto hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best\nstuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.\nThe growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy, there was a\nsmall skilled labor and professional class for which deep work was crucial, but most\nworkers could do just fine without ever cultivating an ability to concentrate without\ndistraction. They were paid to crank \nwidgets—and not much about their job would\nchange in the decades they kept it. But as we shift to an information economy, more\nand more of our population are knowledge workers, and deep work is becoming a key\ncurrency—even if most haven’t yet recognized this reality.\nDeep work is not, in other words, an old-fashioned skill falling into irrelevance.\nIt’s instead a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally\ncompetitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren’t\nearning their keep. The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable\nusing Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are\ncomfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a\ndecidedly deep task, hard to replicate). Deep work is so important that we might\nconsider it, to use the phrasing of business writer Eric Barker, “the superpower of the\n21st century.”\nWe have now seen two strands of thought—one about the increasing scarcity of deep\nwork and the other about its increasing value—which we can combine into the idea\nthat provides the foundation for everything that follows in this book:\nThe Deep Work Hypothesis:\n The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly \nrare\n at exactly\nthe same time it is becoming increasingly \nvaluable\n in our economy. As a consequence, the few who\ncultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\nThis book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to\nconvince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to\nteach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming\nyour work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life. Before\ndiving into these details, however, I’ll take a moment to explain how I became such a\ndevotee of depth.\nI’ve spent the past decade cultivating my own ability to concentrate on hard things. To\nunderstand the origins of this interest, it helps to know that I’m a theoretical computer\nscientist who performed my doctoral training in MIT’s famed Theory of Computation\ngroup—a professional setting where the ability to focus is considered a crucial\n\f\noccupational skill.\nDuring these years, I shared a graduate student office down the hall from a\nMacArthur “genius grant” winner—a professor who was hired at MIT before he was\nold enough to legally drink. It wasn’t uncommon to find this theoretician sitting in the\ncommon space, staring at markings on a whiteboard, with a group of visiting scholars\narrayed around him, also sitting quietly and staring. This could go on for hours. I’d go\nto lunch; I’d come back—still staring. This particular professor is hard to reach. He’s\nnot on Twitter and if he doesn’t know you, he’s unlikely to respond to your e-mail.\nLast year he published sixteen papers.\nThis type of fierce concentration permeated the atmosphere during my student\nyears. Not surprisingly, I soon developed a similar commitment to depth. To the\nchagrin of \nboth my friends and the various publicists I’ve worked with on my books,\nI’ve never had a Facebook or Twitter account, or any other social media presence\noutside of a blog. I don’t Web surf and get most of my news from my home-delivered\nWashington Post\n and NPR. I’m also generally hard to reach: My author website\ndoesn’t provide a personal e-mail address, and I didn’t own my first smartphone until\n2012 (when my pregnant wife gave me an ultimatum—“you have to have a phone \nthat\nworks\n before our son is born”).\nOn the other hand, my commitment to depth has rewarded me. In the ten-year\nperiod following my college graduation, I published four books, earned a PhD, wrote\npeer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was hired as a tenure-track\nprofessor at Georgetown University. I maintained this voluminous production while\nrarely working past five or six p.m. during the workweek.\nThis compressed schedule is possible because I’ve invested significant effort to\nminimize the shallow in my life while making sure I get the most out of the time this\nfrees up. I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the\nshallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the\nperipheries of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of\nuninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of\nvaluable output.\nMy commitment to depth has also returned nonprofessional benefits. For the most\npart, I don’t touch a computer between the time when I get home from work and the\nnext morning when the new workday begins (the main \nexception being blog posts,\nwhich I like to write after my kids go to bed). This ability to fully disconnect, as\nopposed to the more standard practice of sneaking in a few quick work e-mail checks,\nor giving in to frequent surveys of social media sites, allows me to be present with my\n\f\nwife and two sons in the evenings, and read a surprising number of books for a busy\nfather of two. More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that\nbackground hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people’s\ndaily lives. I’m comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding\nskill—especially on a lazy D.C. summer night listening to a Nationals game slowly\nunfold on the radio.\nThis book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to\ndepth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that have helped me act on\nthis attraction. I’ve committed this thinking to words, in part, to help you follow my\nlead in rebuilding your life around deep work—but this isn’t the whole story. My\nother interest in distilling and clarifying these thoughts is to further develop my own\npractice. My recognition of the deep work hypothesis has helped me thrive, but I’m\nconvinced that I haven’t yet reached my full value-producing potential. As you struggle\nand ultimately triumph with the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead, you can be\nassured that I’m following suit—ruthlessly culling the shallow and painstakingly\ncultivating the intensity of my depth. (You’ll learn how I fare in this book’s\nconclusion.)\nWhen Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in\nthe woods. Jung’s Bollingen Tower became a place where he could maintain his\nability to think deeply and then apply the skill to produce work of such stunning\noriginality that it changed the world. In the pages ahead, I’ll try to convince you to join\nme in the effort to build our own personal Bollingen Towers; to cultivate an ability to\nproduce real value in an increasingly distracted world; and to recognize a truth\nembraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past: A\ndeep life is a good life."

    "raw_text": "Chapter One\nDeep Work Is Valuable\nAs Election Day loomed in 2012, traffic at the \nNew York Times\n website spiked, as is\nnormal during moments of national importance. But this time, something was different.\nA wildly disproportionate fraction of this traffic—more than 70 percent by some\nreports—was visiting a single location in the sprawling domain. It wasn’t a front-page\nbreaking news story, and it wasn’t commentary from one of the paper’s Pulitzer Prize–\nwinning columnists; it was instead a blog run by a baseball stats geek turned election\nforecaster named Nate Silver. Less than a year later, ESPN and ABC News lured\nSilver away from the \nTimes\n (which tried to retain him by promising a staff of up to a\ndozen writers) in a major deal that would give Silver’s operation a role in everything\nfrom sports to weather to network news segments to, improbably enough, Academy\nAwards telecasts. Though there’s debate about the methodological rigor of Silver’s\nhand-tuned models, there are few who deny that in 2012 this thirty-five-year-old data\nwhiz was a winner in our economy.\nAnother winner is David Heinemeier Hansson, a computer programming star who\ncreated the Ruby on Rails \nwebsite development framework, which currently provides\nthe foundation for some of the Web’s most popular destinations, including Twitter and\nHulu. Hansson is a partner in the influential development firm Basecamp (called\n37signals until 2014). Hansson doesn’t talk publicly about the magnitude of his profit\nshare from Basecamp or his other revenue sources, but we can assume they’re\nlucrative given that Hansson splits his time between Chicago, Malibu, and Marbella,\nSpain, where he dabbles in high-performance race-car driving.\nOur third and final example of a clear winner in our economy is John Doerr, a\ngeneral partner in the famed Silicon Valley venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins\nCaufield & Byers. Doerr helped fund many of the key companies fueling the current\ntechnological revolution, including Twitter, Google, Amazon, Netscape, and Sun\nMicrosystems. The return on these investments has been astronomical: Doerr’s net\nworth, as of this writing, is more than $3 billion.\nWhy have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr done so well? There are two types of answers\n\f\nto this question. The first are \nmicro\n in scope and focus on the personality traits and\ntactics that helped drive this trio’s rise. The second type of answers are more \nmacro\nin that they focus less on the individuals and more on the type of work they represent.\nThough both approaches to this core question are important, the macro answers will\nprove most relevant to our discussion, as they better illuminate what our current\neconomy rewards.\nTo explore this macro perspective we turn to a pair of MIT economists, Erik\nBrynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who in \ntheir influential 2011 book, \nRace Against\nthe Machine,\n provide a compelling case that among various forces at play, it’s the\nrise of digital technology in particular that’s transforming our labor markets in\nunexpected ways. “We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson\nand McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many\nof our skills and organizations are lagging behind.” For many workers, this lag\npredicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and\nhuman abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire “new\nmachines” instead of “new people.” And when only a human will do, improvements in\ncommunications and collaboration technology are making remote work easier than\never before, motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars—leaving the local\ntalent pool underemployed.\nThis reality is not, however, universally grim. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee\nemphasize, this Great Restructuring is not \ndriving down\n all jobs but is instead\ndividing\n them. Though an increasing number of people will lose in this new economy\nas their skill becomes automatable or easily outsourced, there are others who will not\nonly survive, but thrive—becoming more valued (and therefore more rewarded) than\nbefore. Brynjolfsson and McAfee aren’t alone in proposing this bimodal trajectory for\nthe economy. In 2013, for example, the George Mason economist Tyler Cowen\npublished \nAverage Is Over\n, a book that echoes this thesis of a digital division. But\nwhat makes Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s analysis particularly useful is that they\nproceed to identify three specific groups that will fall on the lucrative \nside of this\ndivide and reap a disproportionate amount of the benefits of the Intelligent Machine\nAge. Not surprisingly, it’s to these three groups that Silver, Hansson, and Doerr\nhappen to belong. Let’s touch on each of these groups in turn to better understand why\nthey’re suddenly so valuable.\nThe High-Skilled Workers\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee call the group personified by Nate Silver the “high-skilled”\n\f\nworkers. Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-\nskilled positions, but as these economists emphasize, “other technologies like data\nvisualization, analytics, high speed communications, and rapid prototyping have\naugmented the contributions of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the\nvalues of these jobs.” In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and\ntease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive. Tyler Cowen\nsummarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are you good at\nworking with intelligent machines or not?”\nNate Silver, of course, with his comfort in feeding data into large databases, then\nsiphoning it out into his mysterious Monte Carlo simulations, is the epitome of the\nhigh-skilled worker. Intelligent machines are not an obstacle to Silver’s success, but\ninstead provide its precondition.\nThe Superstars\nThe ace programmer David Heinemeier Hansson provides an example of the second\ngroup that Brynjolfsson and McAfee predict will thrive in our new economy:\n“superstars.” \nHigh-speed data networks and collaboration tools like e-mail and virtual\nmeeting software have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of knowledge work. It\nno longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office\nspace, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world’s best\nprogrammers, like Hansson, for just enough time to complete the project at hand. In\nthis scenario, you’ll probably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can\nservice many more clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off.\nThe fact that Hansson might be working remotely from Marbella, Spain, while your\noffice is in Des Moines, Iowa, doesn’t matter to your company, as advances in\ncommunication and collaboration technology make the process near seamless. (This\nreality does matter, however, to the less-skilled local programmers living in Des\nMoines and in need of a steady paycheck.) This same trend holds for the growing\nnumber of fields where technology makes productive remote work possible—\nconsulting, marketing, writing, design, and so on. Once the talent market is made\nuniversally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.\nIn a seminal 1981 paper, the economist Sherwin Rosen worked out the mathematics\nbehind these “winner-take-all” markets. One of his key insights was to explicitly\nmodel talent—labeled, innocuously, with the variable \nq\n in his formulas—as a factor\nwith “imperfect substitution,” which Rosen explains as follows: “Hearing a\nsuccession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.”\n\f\nIn other words, talent is not a commodity you can \nbuy in bulk and combine to reach the\nneeded levels: There’s a premium to being the best. Therefore, if you’re in a\nmarketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone’s \nq\n value\nis clear, the consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the\nbest is small compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still\nwin the bulk of the market.\nIn the 1980s, when Rosen studied this effect, he focused on examples like movie\nstars and musicians, where there existed clear markets, such as music stores and\nmovie theaters, where an audience has access to different performers and can\naccurately approximate their talent before making a purchasing decision. The rapid\nrise of communication and collaboration technologies has transformed many other\nformerly local markets into a similarly universal bazaar. The small company looking\nfor a computer programmer or public relations consultant now has access to an\ninternational marketplace of talent in the same way that the advent of the record store\nallowed the small-town music fan to bypass local musicians to buy albums from the\nworld’s best bands. The superstar effect, in other words, has a broader application\ntoday than Rosen could have predicted thirty years ago. An increasing number of\nindividuals in our economy are now competing with the rock stars of their sectors.\nThe Owners\nThe final group that will thrive in our new economy—the group epitomized by John\nDoerr—consists of those with capital to invest in the new technologies that are driving\nthe Great Restructuring. As we’ve understood since Marx, access to capital provides\nmassive advantages. It’s also true, however, that some periods offer more advantages\nthan others. As Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out, postwar Europe was an example\nof a bad time to be sitting on a pile of cash, as the combination of rapid inflation and\naggressive taxation wiped out old fortunes with surprising speed (what we might call\nthe “Downton Abbey Effect”).\nThe Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, \nis\n a particularly good time to\nhave access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key\ncomponent in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the\ncombination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly\nspeaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in\nmany industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the\nintelligent machines is growing. A venture capitalist in today’s economy can fund a\ncompany like Instagram, which was eventually sold for a billion dollars, while\n\f\nemploying \nonly thirteen people\n. When else in history could such a small amount of\nlabor be involved in such a large amount of value? With so little input from labor, the\nproportion of this wealth that flows back to the machine owners—in this case, the\nventure investors—is without precedent. It’s no wonder that a venture capitalist I\ninterviewed for my last book admitted to me with some concern, “Everyone wants my\njob.”\nLet’s pull together the threads spun so far: Current economic thinking, as I’ve\nsurveyed, argues that the unprecedented \ngrowth and impact of technology are creating\na massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a\nparticular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent\nmachines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.\nTo be clear, this Great Restructuring identified by economists like Brynjolfsson,\nMcAfee, and Cowen is not the \nonly\n economic trend of importance at the moment, and\nthe three groups mentioned previously are not the \nonly\n groups who will do well, but\nwhat’s important for this book’s argument is that these trends, even if not alone, \nare\nimportant, and these groups, even if they are not the only such groups, \nwill\n thrive. If\nyou can join any of these groups, therefore, you’ll do well. If you cannot, you might\nstill do well, but your position is more precarious.\nThe question we must now face is the obvious one: How does one join these\nwinners? At the risk of quelling your rising enthusiasm, I should first confess that I\nhave no secret for quickly amassing capital and becoming the next John Doerr. (If I\nhad such secrets, it’s unlikely I’d share them in a book.) The other two winning\ngroups, however, are accessible. How to access them is the goal we tackle next.\nHow to Become a Winner in the New Economy\nI just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim are accessible:\nthose who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in\ntheir field. \nWhat’s the secret to landing in these lucrative sectors of the widening\ndigital divide? I argue that the following two core abilities are crucial.\nTwo Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy\n1. The ability to quickly master hard things.\n2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.\n\f\nLet’s begin with the first ability. To start, we must remember that we’ve been\nspoiled by the intuitive and drop-dead-simple user experience of many consumer-\nfacing technologies, like Twitter and the iPhone. These examples, however, are\nconsumer products, not serious tools: Most of the intelligent machines driving the\nGreat Restructuring are significantly more complex to understand and master.\nConsider Nate Silver, our earlier example of someone who thrives by working\nwell with complicated technology. If we dive deeper into his methodology, we\ndiscover that generating data-driven election forecasts is not as easy as typing “Who\nwill win more votes?” into a search box. He instead maintains a large database of poll\nresults (thousands of polls from more than 250 pollsters) that he feeds into Stata, a\npopular statistical analysis system produced by a company called StataCorp. These\nare not easy tools to master. Here, for example, is the type of command you need to\nunderstand to work with a modern database like Silver uses:\nCREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT name, population, altitude FROM capitals UNION SELECT\nname, population, altitude FROM non_capitals;\nDatabases of this type are interrogated in a language called SQL. You send them\ncommands like the one shown here to interact with their stored information.\nUnderstanding how to manipulate these databases is subtle. The example command,\nfor example, creates a “view”: a virtual database table that pulls together data from\nmultiple existing tables, and that can then be addressed by the SQL commands like a\nstandard table. When to create views and how to do so well is a tricky question, one\nof many that you must understand and master to tease reasonable results out of real-\nworld databases.\nSticking with our Nate Silver case study, consider the other technology he relies\non: Stata. This is a powerful tool, and definitely not something you can learn\nintuitively after some modest tinkering. Here, for example, is a description of the\nfeatures added to the most recent version of this software: “Stata 13 adds many new\nfeatures such as treatment effects, multilevel GLM, power and sample size,\ngeneralized SEM, forecasting, effect sizes, Project Manager, long strings and BLOBs,\nand much more.” Silver uses this complex software—with its generalized SEM and\nBLOBs—to build intricate models with interlocking parts: multiple regressions,\nconducted on custom parameters, which are then referenced as custom weights used in\nprobabilistic expressions, and so on.\nThe point of providing these details is to emphasize that intelligent machines are\ncomplicated and hard to master.\n*\n To join the group of those who can work well with\nthese machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things.\n\f\nAnd because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things\nnever ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.\nThis ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary for working\nwell with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a\nsuperstar in just about any field—even those that have little to do with technology. To\nbecome a world-class yoga instructor, for example, requires that you master an\nincreasingly complex set of physical skills. To excel in a particular area of medicine,\nto give another example, requires that you be able to quickly master the latest research\non relevant procedures. To summarize these observations more succinctly: If you can’t\nlearn, you can’t thrive.\nNow consider the second core ability from the list shown earlier: producing at an\nelite level. If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is\nnecessary, but not \nsufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible\nresults that people value. Many developers, for example, can program computers well,\nbut David Hansson, our example superstar from earlier, leveraged this ability to\nproduce Ruby on Rails, the project that made his reputation. Ruby on Rails required\nHansson to push his current skills to their limit and produce unambiguously valuable\nand concrete results.\nThis ability to produce also applies to those looking to master intelligent machines.\nIt wasn’t enough for Nate Silver to learn how to manipulate large data sets and run\nstatistical analyses; he needed to then show that he could use this skill to tease\ninformation from these machines that a large audience cared about. Silver worked\nwith many stats geeks during his days at \nBaseball Prospectus\n, but it was Silver alone\nwho put in the effort to adapt these skills to the new and more lucrative territory of\nelection forecasting. This provides another general observation for joining the ranks of\nwinners in our economy: If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how\nskilled or talented you are.\nHaving established two abilities that are fundamental to getting ahead in our new,\ntechnology-disrupted world, we can now ask the obvious follow-up question: How\ndoes one cultivate these core abilities? It’s here that we arrive at a central thesis of\nthis book: \nThe two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform\ndeep work.\n If you haven’t mastered this foundational skill, you’ll struggle to learn\nhard things or produce at an elite level.\nThe dependence of these abilities on deep work isn’t \nimmediately obvious; it\nrequires a closer look at the science of learning, concentration, and productivity. The\nsections ahead provide this closer look, and by doing so will help this connection"

Sertillanges wrote\nthe book as a guide to “the development and deepening of the mind” for those called to\nmake a living in the world of ideas. Throughout \nThe Intellectual Life\n, Sertillanges\nrecognizes the necessity of mastering complicated material and helps prepare the\nreader for this challenge. For this reason, his book proves useful in our quest to better\nunderstand how people quickly master hard (cognitive) skills.\nTo understand Sertillanges’s advice, let’s return to the quote from earlier. In these\nwords, which are echoed in many forms in \nThe Intellectual Life\n, Sertillanges argues\nthat to advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics\nsystematically, allowing your “converging \nrays of attention” to uncover the truth latent\nin each. In other words, he teaches: \nTo learn requires intense concentration\n. This\nidea turns out to be ahead of its time. In reflecting on the life of the mind in the 1920s,\nSertillanges uncovered a fact about mastering cognitively demanding tasks that would\ntake academia another seven decades to formalize.\nThis task of formalization began in earnest in the 1970s, when a branch of\npsychology, sometimes called performance psychology, began to systematically\nexplore what separates experts (in many different fields) from everyone else. In the\nearly 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, pulled\ntogether these strands into a single coherent answer, consistent with the growing\nresearch literature, that he gave a punchy name: deliberate practice.\nEricsson opens his seminal paper on the topic with a powerful claim: “We deny\nthat these differences [between expert performers and normal adults] are immutable…\nInstead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults\nreflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific\ndomain.”\nAmerican culture, in particular, loves the storyline of the prodigy (“Do you know"

    "raw_text": "how easy this is for me!?” Matt Damon’s character famously cries in the movie \nGood\nWill Hunting\n as he makes quick work of proofs that stymie the world’s top\nmathematicians). The line of research promoted by Ericsson, and now widely\naccepted (with caveats\n*\n), de-\nstabilizes these myths. To master a cognitively\ndemanding task requires this specific form of practice—there are few exceptions\nmade for natural talent. (On this point too, Sertillanges seems to have been ahead of\nhis time, arguing in \nThe Intellectual Life\n, “Men of genius themselves were great only\nby bringing all their power to bear on the point on which they had decided to show\ntheir full measure.” Ericsson couldn’t have said it better.)\nThis brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core\ncomponents are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a\nspecific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you\nreceive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly\nwhere it’s most productive. The first component is of particular importance to our\ndiscussion, as it emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction,\nand that it instead requires uninterrupted concentration. As Ericsson emphasizes,\n“Diffused attention \nis almost antithetical to the \nfocused attention\n required by\ndeliberate practice” (emphasis mine).\nAs psychologists, Ericsson and the other researchers in his field are not interested\nin \nwhy\n deliberate practice works; they’re just identifying it as an effective behavior. In\nthe intervening decades since Ericsson’s first major papers on the topic, however,\nneuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s\nimprovements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book,\nThe Talent Code\n, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a\nlayer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the\ncells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep\nin mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain\ncircuits. This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you\ndevelop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit\nto fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well\nmyelinated.\nThis understanding is important because it provides a neurological foundation for\nwhy deliberate practice works. By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re\nforcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This\nrepetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin\nwrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing\nthe skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at\n\f\nhand while avoiding distraction is because this \nis the only way to isolate the relevant\nneural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn\na complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration\n(perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits\nsimultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to\nstrengthen.\nIn the century that has passed since Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges first wrote about\nusing the mind like a lens to focus rays of attention, we have advanced from this\nelevated metaphor to a decidedly less poetic explanation expressed in terms of\noligodendrocyte cells. But this sequence of thinking about thinking points to an\ninescapable conclusion: To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without\ndistraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable\ngoing deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and\nskills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for\nwhom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn’t expect these\nsystems and skills to come easily to you.\nDeep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level\nAdam Grant produces at an elite level. When I met Grant in 2013, he was the youngest\nprofessor to be awarded tenure at the Wharton School of Business at Penn. A year\nlater, when I started writing this chapter (and was just \nbeginning to think about my\nown tenure process), the claim was updated: He’s now the youngest \nfull professor\n*\n at\nWharton.\nThe reason Grant advanced so quickly in his corner of academia is simple: He\nproduces. In 2012, Grant published seven articles—all of them in major journals. This\nis an absurdly high rate for his field (in which professors tend to work alone or in\nsmall professional collaborations and do not have large teams of students and\npostdocs to support their research). In 2013, this count fell to five. This is still\nabsurdly high, but below his recent standards. He can be excused for this dip,\nhowever, because this same year he published a book titled \nGive and Take\n, which\npopularized some of his research on relationships in business. To say that this book\nwas successful is an understatement. It ended up featured on the cover of the \nNew York\nTimes Magazine\n and went on to become a massive bestseller. When Grant was\nawarded full professorship in 2014, he had already written more than sixty peer-\nreviewed publications in addition to his bestselling book.\n\f\nSoon after meeting Grant, my own academic career on my mind, I couldn’t help but\nask him about his productivity. Fortunately for me, he was happy to share his thoughts\non the subject. It turns out that Grant thinks a lot about \nthe mechanics of producing at\nan elite level. He sent me, for example, a collection of PowerPoint slides from a\nworkshop he attended with several other professors in his field. The event was\nfocused on data-driven observations about how to produce academic work at an\noptimum rate. These slides included detailed pie charts of time allocation per season,\na flowchart capturing relationship development with co-authors, and a suggested\nreading list with more than twenty titles. These business professors do not live the\ncliché of the absentminded academic lost in books and occasionally stumbling on a big\nidea. They see productivity as a scientific problem to systematically solve—a goal\nAdam Grant seems to have achieved.\nThough Grant’s productivity depends on many factors, there’s one idea in\nparticular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard but important\nintellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. Grant performs this batching at\nmultiple levels. Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during\nwhich he can turn all of his attention to teaching well and being available to his\nstudents. (This method seems to work, as Grant is currently the highest-rated teacher at\nWharton and the winner of multiple teaching awards.) By batching his teaching in the\nfall, Grant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and\ntackle this work with less distraction.\nGrant also batches his attention on a smaller time scale. Within a semester\ndedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to\nstudents and \ncolleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely\nand without distraction on a single research task. (He typically divides the writing of a\nscholarly paper into three discrete tasks: analyzing the data, writing a full draft, and\nediting the draft into something publishable.) During these periods, which can last up\nto three or four days, he’ll often put an out-of-office auto-responder on his e-mail so\ncorrespondents will know not to expect a response. “It sometimes confuses my\ncolleagues,” he told me. “They say, ‘You’re not out of office, I see you in your office\nright now!’” But to Grant, it’s important to enforce strict isolation until he completes\nthe task at hand.\nMy guess is that Adam Grant doesn’t work substantially more hours than the\naverage professor at an elite research institution (generally speaking, this is a group\nprone to workaholism), but he still manages to produce more than just about anyone\nelse in his field. I argue that his approach to batching helps explain this paradox. In\nparticular, by consolidating his work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s\n\f\nleveraging the following law of productivity:\nHigh-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)\nIf you believe this formula, then Grant’s habits make sense: By maximizing his\nintensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent\nworking.\nThis is not the first time I’ve encountered this formulaic conception of productivity.\nIt first came to my attention \nwhen I was researching my second book, \nHow to Become\na Straight-A Student\n, many years earlier. During that research process, I interviewed\naround fifty ultra-high-scoring college undergraduates from some of the country’s most\ncompetitive schools. Something I noticed in these interviews is that the very best\nstudents often studied less than the group of students right below them on the GPA\nrankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula\ndetailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity\nand therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically\nreducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the\nquality of their results.\nThe example of Adam Grant implies that this intensity formula applies beyond just\nundergraduate GPA and is also relevant to other cognitively demanding tasks. But why\nwould this be? An interesting explanation comes from Sophie Leroy, a business\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota. In a 2009 paper, titled, intriguingly, “Why Is\nIt So Hard to Do My Work?,” Leroy introduced an effect she called \nattention residue\n.\nIn the introduction to this paper, she noted that other researchers have studied the\neffect of multitasking—trying to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously—on\nperformance, but that in the modern knowledge work office, once you got to a high\nenough level, it was more common to find people working on multiple projects\nsequentially: “Going from one meeting to the next, starting to work on one project and\nsoon after having to transition to another is just part of life in organizations,” Leroy\nexplains.\nThe problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you\nswitch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately\nfollow—a \nresidue\n of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This\nresidue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low\nintensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your\nattention remains divided for a while.\nLeroy studied the effect of this attention residue on performance by forcing task\nswitches in the laboratory. In one such experiment, for example, she started her\n\f\nsubjects working on a set of word puzzles. In one of the trials, she would interrupt\nthem and tell them that they needed to move on to a new and challenging task, in this\ncase, reading résumés and making hypothetical hiring decisions. In other trials, she let\nthe subjects finish the puzzles before giving them the next task. In between puzzling\nand hiring, she would deploy a quick lexical decision game to quantify the amount of\nresidue left from the first task.\n*\n The results from this and her similar experiments were\nclear: “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to\ndemonstrate \npoor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the\nworse the performance.\nThe concept of attention residue helps explain why the intensity formula is true and\ntherefore helps explain Grant’s productivity. By working on a single hard task for a\nlong time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue\nfrom his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task.\nWhen Grant is working for days in isolation on a paper, in other words, he’s doing so\nat a higher level of effectiveness than the standard professor following a more\ndistracted strategy in which the work is repeatedly interrupted by residue-slathering\ninterruptions.\nEven if you’re unable to fully replicate Grant’s extreme isolation (we’ll tackle\ndifferent strategies for scheduling depth in Part 2), the attention residue concept is still\ntelling because it implies that the common habit of working in a state of semi-\ndistraction is potentially devastating to your performance. It might seem harmless to\ntake a quick glance at your inbox every ten minutes or so. Indeed, many justify this\nbehavior as \nbetter\n than the old practice of leaving an inbox open on the screen at all\ntimes (a straw-man habit that few follow anymore). But Leroy teaches us that this is\nnot in fact much of an improvement. That quick check introduces a new target for your\nattention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at the moment\n(which is almost always the case), you’ll be forced to turn back to the primary task\nwith a secondary task left unfinished. The \nattention residue left by such unresolved\nswitches dampens your performance.\nWhen we step back from these individual observations, we see a clear argument\nform: To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full\nconcentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, \nthe type of\nwork that optimizes your performance is deep work.\n If you’re not comfortable\ngoing deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to\nthe peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally.\nUnless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep\nworkers among them will outproduce you.\n\f\nWhat About Jack Dorsey?\nI’ve now made my argument for why deep work supports abilities that are becoming\nincreasingly important in our economy. Before we accept this conclusion, however,\nwe must face a type of question that often arises when I discuss this topic: \nWhat about\nJack Dorsey?\nJack Dorsey helped found Twitter. After stepping down as CEO, he then launched\nthe payment-processing company Square. To quote a Forbes profile: “He is a\ndisrupter on a massive scale and a repeat offender.” He is also someone who does not\nspend a lot of time in a state of deep work. Dorsey doesn’t have the luxury of long\nperiods of uninterrupted thinking because, at the time when the Forbes profile was\nwritten, he maintained management duties at both Twitter \n(where he remained\nchairman) and Square, leading to a tightly calibrated schedule that ensures that the\ncompanies have a predictable “weekly cadence” (and that also ensures that Dorsey’s\ntime and attention are severely fractured).\nDorsey reports, for example, that he ends the average day with thirty to forty sets of\nmeeting notes that he reviews and filters at night. In the small spaces between all these\nmeetings, he believes in serendipitous availability. “I do a lot of my work at stand-up\ntables, which anyone can come up to,” Dorsey said. “I get to hear all these\nconversations around the company.”\nThis style of work is not deep. To use a term from our previous section, Dorsey’s\nattention residue is likely slathered on thick as he darts from one meeting to another,\nletting people interrupt him freely in the brief interludes in between. And yet, we\ncannot say that Dorsey’s work is shallow, because shallow work, as defined in the\nintroduction, is low value and easily replicable, while what Jack Dorsey does is\nincredibly valuable and highly rewarded in our economy (as of this writing he was\namong the top one thousand richest people in the world, with a net worth over $1.1\nbillion).\nJack Dorsey is important to our discussion because he’s an exemplar of a group we\ncannot ignore: individuals who thrive without depth. When I titled the motivating\nquestion of this section “What About Jack Dorsey?,” I was providing a specific\nexample of a more general query: If deep work is so important, why are there\ndistracted people who do well? To conclude this chapter, I want to address this\nquestion so it \ndoesn’t nag at your attention as we dive deeper into the topic of depth in\nthe pages ahead.\nTo start, we must first note that Jack Dorsey is a high-level executive of a large"

    "raw_text": "company (two companies, in fact). Individuals with such positions play a major role\nin the category of those who thrive without depth, because the lifestyle of such\nexecutives is famously and unavoidably distracted. Here’s Kerry Trainor, CEO of\nVimeo, trying to answer the question of how long he can go without e-mail: “I can go a\ngood solid Saturday without, without… well, most of the daytime without it… I mean,\nI’ll \ncheck it\n, but I won’t necessarily respond.”\nAt the same time, of course, these executives are better compensated and more\nimportant in the American economy today than in any other time in history. Jack\nDorsey’s success without depth is common at this elite level of management. Once\nwe’ve stipulated this reality, we must then step back to remind ourselves that it\ndoesn’t undermine the general value of depth. Why? Because the necessity of\ndistraction in these executives’ work lives is highly specific to their particular jobs. A\ngood chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engine, not unlike\nIBM’s \nJeopardy!\n-playing Watson system. They have built up a hard-won repository of\nexperience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They’re then\npresented inputs throughout the day—in the form of e-mails, meetings, site visits, and\nthe like—that they must process and act on. To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking\ndeeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It’s\nbetter to hire three smart \nsubordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring\ntheir solutions to the executive for a final decision.\nThis specificity is important because it tells us that if you’re a high-level executive\nat a major company, you probably don’t need the advice in the pages that follow. On\nthe other hand, it also tells us that you cannot extrapolate the approach of these\nexecutives to \nother\n jobs. The fact that Dorsey encourages interruption or Kerry\nTrainor checks his e-mail constantly doesn’t mean that you’ll share their success if you\nfollow suit: Their behaviors are characteristic of their specific roles as corporate\nofficers.\nThis rule of specificity should be applied to similar counterexamples that come to\nmind while reading the rest of this book. There are, we must continually remember,\ncertain corners of our economy where depth is not valued. In addition to executives,\nwe can also include, for example, certain types of salesmen and lobbyists, for whom\nconstant connection is their most valued currency. There are even those who manage\nto grind out distracted success in fields where depth would help.\nBut at the same time, don’t be too hasty to label your job as necessarily non-deep.\nJust because your current habits make deep work difficult doesn’t mean that this lack\nof depth is fundamental to doing your job well. In the next chapter, for example, I tell\n\f\nthe story of a group of high-powered management consultants who were convinced\nthat constant e-mail connectivity was necessary for them to service their clients. When\na Harvard professor forced them to disconnect more regularly (as part of a research\nstudy), they \nfound, to their surprise, that this connectivity didn’t matter nearly as much\nas they had assumed. The clients didn’t really need to reach them at all times and their\nperformance as consultants \nimproved\n once their attention became less fractured.\nSimilarly, several managers I know tried to convince me that they’re most valuable\nwhen they’re able to respond quickly to their teams’ problems, preventing project\nlogjams. They see their role as enabling others’ productivity, not necessarily\nprotecting their own. Follow-up discussions, however, soon uncovered that this goal\ndidn’t \nreally\n require attention-fracturing connectivity. Indeed, many software\ncompanies now deploy the Scrum project management methodology, which replaces a\nlot of this ad hoc messaging with regular, highly structured, and ruthlessly efficient\nstatus meetings (often held standing up to minimize the urge to bloviate). This\napproach frees up more managerial time for thinking deeply about the problems their\nteams are tackling, often improving the overall value of what they produce.\nPut another way: Deep work is not the \nonly\n skill valuable in our economy, and it’s\npossible to do well without fostering this ability, \nbut\n the niches where this is\nadvisable are increasingly rare. Unless you have strong evidence that distraction is\nimportant for your specific profession, you’re best served, for the reasons argued\nearlier in this chapter, by giving serious consideration to depth."

    "raw_text": "Chapter Two\nDeep Work Is Rare\nIn 2012, Facebook unveiled the plans for a new headquarters designed by Frank\nGehry. At the center of this new building is what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called “the\nlargest open floor plan in the world”: More than three thousand employees will work\non movable furniture spread over a ten-acre expanse. Facebook, of course, is not the\nonly Silicon Valley heavyweight to embrace the open office concept. When Jack\nDorsey, whom we met at the end of the last chapter, bought the old San Francisco\nChronicle building to house Square, he configured the space so that his developers\nwork in common spaces on long shared desks. “We encourage people to stay out in the\nopen because we believe in serendipity—and people walking by each other teaching\nnew things,” Dorsey explained.\nAnother big business trend in recent years is the rise of instant messaging. A \nTimes\narticle notes that this technology is no longer the “province of chatty teenagers” and is\nnow helping companies benefit from “new productivity gains and improvements in\ncustomer response time.” A senior product \nmanager at IBM boasts: “We send 2.5\nmillion I.M.’s within I.B.M. each day.”\nOne of the more successful recent entrants into the business IM space is Hall, a\nSilicon Valley start-up that helps employees move beyond just chat and engage in\n“real-time collaboration.” A San Francisco–based developer I know described to me\nwhat it was like to work in a company that uses Hall. The most “efficient” employees,\nhe explained, set up their text editor to flash an alert on their screen when a new\nquestion or comment is posted to the company’s Hall account. They can then, with a\nsequence of practiced keystrokes, jump over to Hall, type in their thoughts, and then\njump back to their coding with barely a pause. My friend seemed impressed when\ndescribing their speed.\nA third trend is the push for content producers of all types to maintain a social\nmedia presence. The \nNew York Times\n, a bastion of old-world media values, now\nencourages its employees to tweet—a hint taken by the more than eight hundred\nwriters, editors, and photographers for the paper who now maintain a Twitter account.\n\f\nThis is not outlier behavior; it’s instead the new normal. When the novelist Jonathan\nFranzen wrote a piece for the \nGuardian\n calling Twitter a “coercive development” in\nthe literary world, he was widely ridiculed as out of touch. The online magazine \nSlate\ncalled Franzen’s complaints a “lonely war on the Internet” and fellow novelist\nJennifer Weiner wrote a response in \nThe New Republic\n in which she argued,\n“Franzen’s a category of one, a lonely voice issuing \nex cathedra\n edicts that can only\napply \nto himself.” The sarcastic hashtag #JonathanFranzenhates soon became a fad.\nI mention these three business trends because they highlight a paradox. In the last\nchapter, I argued that deep work is more valuable than ever before in our shifting\neconomy. If this is true, however, you would expect to see this skill promoted not just\nby ambitious individuals but also by organizations hoping to get the most out of their\nemployees. As the examples provided emphasize, this is not happening. Many other\nideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world,\nincluding, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication,\nand an active presence on social media.\nIt’s bad enough that so many trends are prioritized ahead of deep work, but to add\ninsult to injury, many of these trends actively \ndecrease\n one’s ability to go deep. Open\noffices, for example, might create more opportunities for collaboration,\n*\n but they do so\nat the cost of “massive distraction,” to quote the results of experiments conducted for a\nBritish TV special titled \nThe Secret Life of Office Buildings\n. “If you are just getting\ninto some work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins what you are\nconcentrating on,” said the neuroscientist who ran the experiments for the show. “Even\nthough you are not aware at the time, the brain responds to distractions.”\nSimilar issues apply to the rise of real-time messaging. E-mail inboxes, in theory,\ncan distract you only when you choose to open them, whereas instant messenger\nsystems are meant to be always active—magnifying the impact of interruption. Gloria\nMark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, is an expert on\nthe science of attention fragmentation. In a well-cited study, Mark and her co-authors\nobserved knowledge workers in real offices and found that an interruption, even if\nshort, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction. “This\nwas reported by subjects as being very detrimental,” she summarized with typical\nacademic understatement.\nForcing content producers onto social media also has negative effects on the ability\nto go deep. Serious journalists, for example, need to focus on doing serious journalism\n—diving into complicated sources, pulling out connective threads, crafting persuasive\nprose—so to ask them to interrupt this deep thinking throughout the day to participate"

    "raw_text": "in the frothy back-and-forth of online tittering seems irrelevant (and somewhat\ndemeaning) at best, and devastatingly distracting at worst. The respected \nNew Yorker\nstaff writer George Packer captured this fear well in an essay about why he does not\ntweet: “Twitter is crack for media addicts. It scares me, not because I’m morally\nsuperior to it, but because I don’t think I could handle it. I’m afraid I’d end up letting\nmy son go hungry.” Tellingly, when he wrote that essay, Packer was busy writing his\nbook \nThe Unwinding\n, which came out soon after and promptly won the National Book\nAward—despite (or, perhaps, aided by) his lack of social media use.\nTo summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to\nperform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased\nserendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by\nthe benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard\nthings fast and produce at an elite level). The goal of this chapter is to explain this\nparadox. The rareness of deep work, I’ll argue, is not due to some fundamental\nweakness of the habit. When we look closer at why we embrace distraction in the\nworkplace we’ll find the reasons are more arbitrary than we might expect—based on\nflawed thinking combined with the ambiguity and confusion that often define\nknowledge work. My objective is to convince you that although our current embrace of\ndistraction is a real phenomenon, it’s built on an unstable foundation and can be easily\ndismissed once you decide to cultivate a deep work ethic.\nThe Metric Black Hole\nIn the fall of 2012, Tom Cochran, the chief technology officer of Atlantic Media,\nbecame alarmed at how much time he seemed to spend on e-mail. So like any good\ntechie, he decided to quantify this unease. Observing his own behavior, he measured\nthat in a single week he received 511 e-mail messages and sent 284. This averaged to\naround 160 e-mails per day over a five-day workweek. Calculating further, Cochran\nnoted that even if he managed to spend only thirty seconds per message on average,\nthis still added up to almost \nan hour and a half per day dedicated to moving\ninformation around like a human network router. This seemed like a lot of time spent\non something that wasn’t a primary piece of his job description.\nAs Cochran recalls in a blog post he wrote about his experiment for the \nHarvard\nBusiness Review\n, these simple statistics got him thinking about the rest of his\ncompany. Just how much time were employees of Atlantic Media spending moving\naround information instead of focusing on the specialized tasks they were hired to\nperform? Determined to answer this question, Cochran gathered company-wide\n\f\nstatistics on e-mails sent per day and the average number of words per e-mail. He then\ncombined these numbers with the employees’ average typing speed, reading speed,\nand salary. The result: He discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a\nmillion dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails, with every message sent or\nreceived tapping the company for around ninety-five cents of labor costs. “A ‘free and\nfrictionless’ method of communication,” Cochran summarized, “had soft costs\nequivalent to procuring a small company Learjet.”\nTom Cochran’s experiment yielded an interesting result about the literal cost of a\nseemingly harmless behavior. But the real importance of this story is the experiment\nitself, and in particular, its complexity. It turns out to be really difficult to answer a\nsimple question such as: What’s the impact of our current e-mail habits on the bottom\nline? Cochran had to conduct a company-wide survey and gather statistics from the IT\ninfrastructure. He also had to pull together \nsalary data and information on typing and\nreading speed, and run the whole thing through a statistical model to spit out his final\nresult. And even then, the outcome is fungible, as it’s not able to separate out, for\nexample, how much value was \nproduced\n by this frequent, expensive e-mail use to\noffset some of its cost.\nThis example generalizes to most behaviors that potentially impede or improve\ndeep work. Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has\nvalue, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are difficult to measure. This isn’t a\ntrait unique to habits related to distraction and depth: Generally speaking, as\nknowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder\nto measure the value of an individual’s efforts. The French economist Thomas Piketty\nmade this point explicit in his study of the extreme growth of executive salaries. The\nenabling assumption driving his argument is that “it is objectively difficult to measure\nindividual contributions to a firm’s output.” In the absence of such measures, irrational\noutcomes, such as executive salaries way out of proportion to the executive’s marginal\nproductivity, can occur. Even though some details of Piketty’s theory are\ncontroversial, the underlying assumption that it’s increasingly difficult to measure\nindividuals’ contributions is generally considered, to quote one of his critics,\n“undoubtedly true.”\nWe should not, therefore, expect the bottom-line impact of depth-destroying\nbehaviors to be easily detected. As Tom Cochran discovered, such metrics fall into an\nopaque region resistant to easy measurement—a region I call the \nmetric black hole\n.\nOf course, just because it’s hard to measure metrics related to deep work doesn’t\nautomatically lead to the conclusion that businesses will dismiss it. We have many\nexamples of behaviors for which it’s hard to measure their bottom-line impact but that\n\f\nnevertheless flourish in our business culture; think, for example, of the three trends that\nopened this chapter, or the outsize executive salaries that puzzled Thomas Piketty. But\nwithout clear metrics to support it, any business behavior is vulnerable to unstable\nwhim and shifting forces, and in this volatile scrum deep work has fared particularly\npoorly.\nThe reality of this metric black hole is the backdrop for the arguments that follow\nin this chapter. In these upcoming sections, I’ll describe various mind-sets and biases\nthat have pushed business away from deep work and toward more distracting\nalternatives. None of these behaviors would survive long if it was clear that they were\nhurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the\nshift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance\nWhen it comes to distracting behaviors embraced in the workplace, we must give a\nposition of dominance to the now ubiquitous \nculture of connectivity\n, where one is\nexpected to read and respond to e-mails (and related communication) quickly. In\nresearching this topic, Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow found that\nthe professionals she \nsurveyed spent around twenty to twenty-five hours a week\noutside the office\n monitoring e-mail—believing it important to answer any e-mail\n(internal or external) within an hour of its arrival.\nYou might argue—as many do—that this behavior is necessary in many fast-paced\nbusinesses. But here’s where things get interesting: Perlow tested this claim. In more\ndetail, she convinced executives at the Boston Consulting Group, a high-pressure\nmanagement consulting firm with an ingrained culture of connectivity, to let her fiddle\nwith the work habits of one of their teams. She wanted to test a simple question: Does\nit really help your work to be constantly connected? To do so, she did something\nextreme: She forced each member of the team to take one day out of the workweek\ncompletely off—no connectivity to anyone inside or outside the company.\n“At first, the team resisted the experiment,” she recalled about one of the trials.\n“The partner in charge, who had been very supportive of the basic idea, was suddenly\nnervous about having to tell her client that each member of her team would be off one\nday a week.” The consultants were equally nervous and worried that they were\n“putting their careers in jeopardy.” But the team didn’t lose their clients and its\nmembers did not lose their jobs. Instead, the consultants found more enjoyment in their\nwork, better communication among themselves, more learning (as we might have"

    "raw_text": "predicted, given the connection between depth and skill development highlighted in\nthe last chapter), and perhaps most important, “a better product delivered to the\nclient.”\nThis motivates an interesting question: Why do so many follow the lead of the\nBoston Consulting Group and foster a culture of connectivity even though it’s likely, as\nPerlow found in her study, that it hurts employees’ well-being and productivity, and\nprobably doesn’t help the bottom line? I think the answer can be found in the following\nreality of workplace behavior.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance:\n In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of\nvarious behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.\nTo return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer,\naccording to our principle, is because \nit’s easier\n. There are at least two big reasons\nwhy this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your needs. If you work in an\nenvironment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of\ninformation immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier—at least, in\nthe moment. If you couldn’t count on this quick response time you’d instead have to do\nmore advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put\nthings aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you\nrequested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder (even if it\nproduced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term). The rise of\nprofessional instant messaging, mentioned earlier in this chapter, can be seen as this\nmind-set pushed toward \nan extreme. If receiving an e-mail reply within an hour makes\nyour day easier, then getting an answer via instant message in under a minute would\nimprove this gain by an order of magnitude.\nThe second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates\nan environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox—\nresponding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the\nwhile feeling satisfyingly productive (more on this soon). If e-mail were to move to\nthe periphery of your workday, you’d be required to deploy a more thoughtful\napproach to figuring out what you should be working on and for how long. This type of\nplanning is hard. Consider, for example, David Allen’s \nGetting Things Done\n task-\nmanagement methodology, which is a well-respected system for intelligently managing\ncompeting workplace obligations. This system proposes a \nfifteen-element\n flowchart\nfor making a decision on what to do next! It’s significantly easier to simply chime in\non the latest cc’d e-mail thread.\nI’m picking on constant connectivity as a case study in this discussion, but it’s just\n\f\none of many examples of business behaviors that are antithetical to depth, and likely\nreducing the bottom-line value produced by the company, that nonetheless thrive\nbecause, in the absence of metrics, most people fall back on what’s easiest.\nTo name another example, consider the common practice of setting up regularly\noccurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules\nto the point where sustained focus during the day becomes \nimpossible. Why do they\npersist? \nThey’re easier.\n For many, these standing meetings become a simple (but\nblunt) form of personal organization. Instead of trying to manage their time and\nobligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them to take\nsome action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible\nsimulacrum of progress.\nAlso consider the frustratingly common practice of forwarding an e-mail to one or\nmore colleagues, labeled with a short open-ended interrogative, such as: “Thoughts?”\nThese e-mails take the sender only a handful of seconds to write but can command\nmany minutes (if not hours, in some cases) of time and attention from their recipients\nto work toward a coherent response. A little more care in crafting the message by the\nsender could reduce the overall time spent by all parties by a significant fraction. So\nwhy are these easily avoidable and time-sucking e-mails so common? From the\nsender’s perspective, \nthey’re easier\n. It’s a way to clear something out of their inbox\n—at least, temporarily—with a minimum amount of energy invested.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black\nhole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of\nconcentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production\nof real value. By doing so, this principle drives us toward shallow work in an\neconomy that increasingly rewards depth. It’s not, however, the only trend that\nleverages the metric black hole to reduce depth. We must \nalso consider the always\npresent and always vexing demand toward “productivity,” the topic we’ll turn our\nattention to next.\nBusyness as a Proxy for Productivity\nThere are a lot of things difficult about being a professor at a research-oriented\nuniversity. But one benefit that this profession enjoys is clarity. How well or how\npoorly you’re doing as an academic researcher can be boiled down to a simple\nquestion: Are you publishing important papers? The answer to this question can even\nbe quantified as a single number, such as the \nh-index\n: a formula, named for its\n\f\ninventor, Jorge Hirsch, that processes your publication and citation counts into a\nsingle value that approximates your impact on your field. In computer science, for\nexample, an h-index score above 40 is difficult to achieve and once reached is\nconsidered the mark of a strong long-term career. On the other hand, if your h-index is\nin single digits when your case goes up for tenure review, you’re probably in trouble.\nGoogle Scholar, a tool popular among academics for finding research papers, even\ncalculates your h-index automatically so you can be reminded, multiple times per\nweek, precisely where you stand. (In case you’re wondering, as of the morning when\nI’m writing this chapter, I’m a 21.)\nThis clarity simplifies decisions about what work habits a professor adopts or\nabandons. Here, for example, is the late Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard\nFeynman \nexplaining in an interview one of his less orthodox productivity strategies:\nTo do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time… it\nneeds a lot of concentration… if you have a job administrating anything, you\ndon’t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I’m\nirresponsible. I’m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything.\nIf anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m\nirresponsible.\nFeynman was adamant in avoiding administrative duties because he knew they\nwould only decrease his ability to do the one thing that mattered most in his\nprofessional life: “to do real good physics work.” Feynman, we can assume, was\nprobably bad at responding to e-mails and would likely switch universities if you had\ntried to move him into an open office or demand that he tweet. Clarity about what\nmatters provides clarity about what does not.\nI mention the example of professors because they’re somewhat exceptional among\nknowledge workers, most of whom don’t share this transparency regarding how well\nthey’re doing their job. Here’s the social critic Matthew Crawford’s description of\nthis uncertainty: “Managers themselves inhabit a bewildering psychic landscape, and\nare made anxious by the vague imperatives they must answer to.”\nThough Crawford was speaking specifically to the plight of the knowledge work\nmiddle manager, the “bewildering \npsychic landscape” he references applies to many\npositions in this sector. As Crawford describes in his 2009 ode to the trades, \nShop\nClass as Soulcraft\n, he quit his job as a Washington, D.C., think tank director to open a\nmotorcycle repair shop exactly to escape this bewilderment. The feeling of taking a\nbroken machine, struggling with it, then eventually enjoying a tangible indication that\nhe had succeeded (the bike driving out of the shop under its own power) provides a\n\f\nconcrete sense of accomplishment he struggled to replicate when his day revolved\nvaguely around reports and communications strategies.\nA similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers. They want to\nprove that they’re productive members of the team and are earning their keep, but\nthey’re not entirely clear what this goal constitutes. They have no rising h-index or\nrack of repaired motorcycles to point to as evidence of their worth. To overcome this\ngap, many seem to be turning back to the last time when productivity was more\nuniversally observable: the industrial age.\nTo understand this claim, recall that with the rise of assembly lines came the rise\nof the Efficiency Movement, identified with its founder, Frederic Taylor, who would\nfamously stand with a stopwatch monitoring the efficiency of worker movements—\nlooking for ways to increase the speed at which they accomplished their tasks. In\nTaylor’s era, productivity was unambiguous: widgets created per unit of time. It seems\nthat in today’s business landscape, many knowledge workers, bereft of other ideas, are\nturning toward this old definition of productivity in trying to solidify their \nvalue in the\notherwise bewildering landscape of their professional lives. (David Allen, for\nexample, even uses the specific phrase “cranking widgets” to describe a productive\nwork flow.) Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible\nbusyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value. Let’s give this\ntendency a name.\nBusyness as Proxy for Productivity:\n In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be\nproductive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of\nproductivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.\nThis mind-set provides another explanation for the popularity of many depth-\ndestroying behaviors. If you send and answer e-mails at all hours, if you schedule and\nattend meetings constantly, if you weigh in on instant message systems like Hall within\nseconds when someone poses a new question, or if you roam your open office\nbouncing ideas off all whom you encounter—all of these behaviors make you seem\nbusy in a public manner. If you’re using busyness as a proxy for productivity, then\nthese behaviors can seem crucial for convincing yourself and others that you’re doing\nyour job well.\nThis mind-set is not necessarily irrational. For some, their jobs really do depend\non such behavior. In 2013, for example, Yahoo’s new CEO Marissa Mayer banned\nemployees from working at home. She made this decision after checking the server\nlogs for the virtual private network that \nYahoo employees use to remotely log in to\ncompany servers. Mayer was upset because the employees working from home didn’t"

She was, in some sense, punishing her employees\nfor not spending more time checking e-mail (one of the primary reasons to log in to the\nservers). “If you’re not visibly busy,” she signaled, “I’ll assume you’re not\nproductive.”\nViewed objectively, however, this concept is anachronistic. Knowledge work is\nnot an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at\nodds with busyness, not supported by it. Remember, for example, Adam Grant, the\nacademic from our last chapter who became the youngest full professor at Wharton by\nrepeatedly shutting himself off from the outside world to concentrate on writing. Such\nbehavior is the opposite of being publicly busy. If Grant worked for Yahoo, Marissa\nMayer might have fired him. But this deep strategy turned out to produce a massive\namount of value.\nWe could, of course, eliminate this anachronistic commitment to busyness if we\ncould easily demonstrate its negative impact on the bottom line, but the metric black\nhole enters the scene at this point and prevents such clarity. This potent mixture of job\nambiguity and lack of metrics to measure the effectiveness of different strategies\nallows behavior that can seem ridiculous when viewed objectively to thrive in the\nincreasingly bewildering psychic landscape of our daily work.\nAs we’ll see next, however, even those who have a clear understanding of what it\nmeans to succeed in their \nknowledge work job can still be lured away from depth. All\nit takes is an ideology seductive enough to convince you to discard common sense.\nThe Cult of the Internet\nConsider Alissa Rubin. She’s the \nNew York Times\n’ bureau chief in Paris. Before that\nshe was the bureau chief in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she reported from the front\nlines on the postwar reconstruction. Around the time I was writing this chapter, she\nwas publishing a series of hard-hitting articles that looked at the French government’s\ncomplicity in the Rwandan genocide. Rubin, in other words, is a serious journalist\nwho is good at her craft. She also, at what I can only assume is the persistent urging of\nher employer, tweets.\nRubin’s Twitter profile reveals a steady and somewhat desultory string of\nmissives, one every two to four days, as if Rubin receives a regular notice from the\nTimes\n’ social media desk (a real thing) reminding her to appease her followers. With\nfew exceptions, the tweets simply mention an article she recently read and liked.\nRubin is a reporter, not a media personality. Her value to her paper is her ability to\n\f\ncultivate important sources, pull together facts, and write articles that make a splash.\nIt’s the Alissa Rubins of the world who provide the \nTimes\n with its reputation, and it’s\nthis reputation that provides the foundation for the paper’s commercial success in an\nage of ubiquitous and addictive click-bait. So why is Alissa Rubin urged to regularly\ninterrupt this necessarily deep work to provide, \nfor free, shallow content to a service\nrun by an unrelated media company based out of Silicon Valley? And perhaps even\nmore important, why does this behavior seem so normal to most people? If we can\nanswer these questions, we’ll better understand the final trend I want to discuss\nrelevant to the question of why deep work has become so paradoxically rare.\nA foundation for our answer can be found in a warning provided by the late\ncommunication theorist and New York University professor Neil Postman. Writing in\nthe early 1990s, as the personal computer revolution first accelerated, Postman argued\nthat our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he\nnoted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the\nnew efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to\ninstead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.\nHe called such a culture a \ntechnopoly\n, and he didn’t mince words in warning\nagainst it. “Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous\nHuxley outlined in \nBrave New World\n,” he argued in his 1993 book on the topic. “It\ndoes not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them\nunpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant.”\nPostman died in 2003, but if he were alive today he would likely express\namazement about how quickly his fears from the 1990s came to fruition—a slide\ndriven by the unforeseen and sudden rise of the Internet. Fortunately, Postman has an\nintellectual heir to continue this argument in the \nInternet Age: the hypercitational social\ncritic Evgeny Morozov. In his 2013 book, \nTo Save Everything, Click Here\n, Morozov\nattempts to pull back the curtains on our technopolic obsession with “the Internet” (a\nterm he purposefully places in scare quotes to emphasize its role as an ideology),\nsaying: “It’s this propensity to view ‘the Internet’ as a source of wisdom and policy\nadvice that transforms it from a fairly uninteresting set of cables and network routers\ninto a seductive and exciting ideology—perhaps today’s uber-ideology.”\nIn Morozov’s critique, we’ve made “the Internet” synonymous with the\nrevolutionary future of business and government. To make your company more like\n“the Internet” is to be with the times, and to ignore these trends is to be the proverbial\nbuggy-whip maker in an automotive age. We no longer see Internet tools as products\nreleased by for-profit companies, funded by investors hoping to make a return, and run\n\f\nby twentysomethings who are often making things up as they go along. We’re instead\nquick to idolize these digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a\n(dare I say, brave) new world.\nThis Internet-centrism (to steal another Morozov term) is what technopoly looks\nlike today. It’s important that we recognize this reality because it explains the question\nthat opened this section. The \nNew York Times\n maintains a social media desk and\npressures its writers, like Alissa Rubin, toward distracting behavior, because in an\nInternet-centric technopoly such behavior is not up for discussion. The alternative, to\nnot embrace all things Internet, is, as Postman would say, “invisible and therefore\nirrelevant.”\nThis invisibility explains the uproar, mentioned earlier, that arose when Jonathan\nFranzen dared suggest that novelists shouldn’t tweet. It riled people not because\nthey’re well versed in book marketing and disagreed with Franzen’s conclusion, but\nbecause it surprised them that anyone serious would suggest the irrelevance of social\nmedia. In an Internet-centric technopoly such a statement is the equivalent of a flag\nburning—desecration, not debate.\nPerhaps the near universal reach of this mind-set is best captured in an experience I\nhad recently on my commute to the Georgetown campus where I work. Waiting for the\nlight to change so I could cross Connecticut Avenue, I idled behind a truck from a\nrefrigerated supply chain logistics company. Refrigerated shipping is a complex,\ncompetitive business that requires equal skill managing trade unions and route\nscheduling. It’s the ultimate old-school industry and in many ways is the opposite of\nthe lean consumer-facing tech start-ups that currently receive so much attention. What\nstruck me as I waited in traffic behind this truck, however, was not the complexity or\nscale of this company, but instead a graphic that had been commissioned and then\naffixed, probably at significant expense, on the back of this entire fleet of trucks—a\ngraphic that read: “like us on Facebook.”\nDeep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values\nlike quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and\nnontechnological. Even worse, to support deep work often requires the rejection of\nmuch of what is new and high-tech. Deep work is exiled in favor of more distracting\nhigh-tech behaviors, \nlike the professional use of social media, not because the former\nis empirically inferior to the latter. Indeed, if we had hard metrics relating the impact\nof these behaviors on the bottom line, our current technopoly would likely crumble.\nBut the metric black hole prevents such clarity and allows us instead to elevate all\nthings Internet into Morozov’s feared “uber-ideology.” In such a culture, we should\n\f\nnot be surprised that deep work struggles to compete against the shiny thrum of tweets,\nlikes, tagged photos, walls, posts, and all the other behaviors that we’re now taught\nare necessary for no other reason than that they exist.\nBad for Business. Good for You.\nDeep work \nshould\n be a priority in today’s business climate. But it’s not. I’ve just\nsummarized various explanations for this paradox. Among them are the realities that\ndeep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the absence of clear goals for\nyour job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving,\nand that our culture has developed a belief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,”\nthen it’s good—regardless of its impact on our ability to produce valuable things. All\nof these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or\nthe cost of ignoring it.\nIf you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in\ngeneral, as it’s leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value\nproduction. But for \nyou\n, as an individual, good news lurks. The myopia \nof your peers\nand employers uncovers a great personal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here\ncontinue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable.\nHaving just established that there’s nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and\nnothing fundamentally necessary about the distracting behaviors that displace it, you\ncan therefore continue with confidence with the ultimate goal of this book: to\nsystematically develop your personal ability to go deep—and by doing so, reap great\nrewards."

    "raw_text": "Chapter Three\nDeep Work Is Meaningful\nRic Furrer is a blacksmith. He specializes in ancient and medieval metalworking\npractices, which he painstakingly re-creates in his shop, Door County Forgeworks. “I\ndo all my work by hand and use tools that multiply my force without limiting my\ncreativity or interaction with the material,” he explains in his artist’s statement. “What\nmay take me 100 blows by hand can be accomplished in one by a large swaging\nmachine. This is the antithesis of my goal and to that end all my work shows evidence\nof the two hands that made it.”\nA 2012 PBS documentary provides a glimpse into Furrer’s world. We learn that he\nworks in a converted barn in Wisconsin farm country, not far inland from the scenic\nSturgeon Bay of Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves the barn doors open (to vent the\nheat of the forges, one suspects), his efforts framed by farm fields stretching to the\nhorizon. The setting is idyllic but the work can seem, at first encounter, brutish. In the\ndocumentary, Furrer is trying to re-create a Viking-era sword. He begins by using a\nfifteen-hundred-year-old technique to smelt \ncrucible steel\n: an unusually pure \n(for the\nperiod) form of the metal. The result is an ingot, not much bigger than three or four\nstacked smartphones. This dense ingot must then be shaped and polished into a long\nand elegant sword blade.\n“This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he\nmethodically heats the ingot, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it, then puts it back in\nthe flames to start over. The narrator reveals that it will take \neight hours\n of this\nhammering to complete the shaping. As you watch Furrer work, however, the sense of\nthe labor shifts. It becomes clear that he’s not drearily whacking at the metal like a\nminer with a pickaxe: Every hit, though forceful, is carefully controlled. He peers\nintently at the metal, through thin-framed intellectual glasses (which seem out of place\nperched above his heavy beard and broad shoulders), turning it \njust so\n for each\nimpact. “You have to be very gentle with it or you will crack it,” he explains. After a\nfew more hammer strikes, he adds: “You have to nudge it; slowly it breaks down; then\nyou start to enjoy it.”\n\f\nAt one point about halfway through the smithing, after Furrer has finished\nhammering out the desired shape, he begins rotating the metal carefully in a narrow\ntrough of burning charcoal. As he stares at the blade something clicks: “It’s ready.” He\nlifts the sword, red with heat, holding it away from his body as he strides swiftly\ntoward a pipe filled with oil and plunges in the blade to cool it. After a moment of\nrelief that the blade did not crack into pieces—a common occurrence at this step—\nFurrer pulls it from the oil. The residual heat of the metal lights the fuel, engulfing the\nsword’s full length in yellow flames. Furrer holds the burning sword up above his\nhead with a single powerful arm and stares at it a moment before blowing out the fire.\nDuring this brief pause, the flames illuminate his face, and his admiration is palpable.\n“To do it right, it is the most complicated thing I know how to make,” Furrer\nexplains. “And it’s that challenge that drives me. I don’t need a sword. But I \nhave\n to\nmake them.”\nRic Furrer is a master craftsman whose work requires him to spend most of his day in\na state of depth—even a small slip in concentration can ruin dozens of hours of effort.\nHe’s also someone who clearly finds great meaning in his profession. This connection\nbetween deep work and a good life is familiar and widely accepted when considering\nthe world of craftsmen. “The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the\nworld through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy,”\nexplains Matthew Crawford. And we believe him.\nBut when we shift our attention to knowledge work this connection is muddied.\nPart of the issue is clarity. Craftsmen like Furrer tackle professional challenges that\nare simple to define but difficult to execute—a useful imbalance when seeking\npurpose. Knowledge work exchanges this clarity for ambiguity. It can be hard to\ndefine exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another:\nOn our worst days, it can seem that \nall\n knowledge work boils down to the same\nexhausting roil of e-mails and PowerPoint, \nwith only the charts used in the slides\ndifferentiating one career from another. Furrer himself identifies this blandness when\nhe writes: “The world of information superhighways and cyber space has left me\nrather cold and disenchanted.”\nAnother issue muddying the connection between depth and meaning in knowledge\nwork is the cacophony of voices attempting to convince knowledge workers to spend\nmore time engaged in shallow activities. As elaborated in the last chapter, we live in\nan era where anything Internet related is understood by default to be innovative and\nnecessary. Depth-destroying behaviors such as immediate e-mail responses and an\nactive social media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generates"

    "raw_text": "suspicion. No one would fault Ric Furrer for not using Facebook, but if a knowledge\nworker makes this same decision, then he’s labeled an eccentric (as I’ve learned from\npersonal experience).\nJust because this connection between depth and meaning is less clear in knowledge\nwork, however, doesn’t mean that it’s nonexistent. The goal of this chapter is to\nconvince you that deep work \ncan\n generate as much satisfaction in an information\neconomy as it so clearly does in a craft economy. In the sections ahead, I’ll make three\narguments to support this claim. These arguments roughly follow a trajectory from the\nconceptually narrow to broad: starting with a neurological perspective, moving to the\npsychological, and ending with the philosophical. I’ll show that regardless of the\nangle from which you attack the issue of depth and knowledge work, it’s clear that by\nembracing depth over shallowness \nyou can tap the same veins of meaning that drive\ncraftsmen like Ric Furrer. The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a\ndeep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.\nA Neurological Argument for Depth\nThe science writer Winifred Gallagher stumbled onto a connection between attention\nand happiness after an unexpected and terrifying event, a cancer diagnosis—“not just\ncancer,” she clarifies, “but a particularly nasty, fairly advanced kind.” As Gallagher\nrecalls in her 2009 book \nRapt\n, as she walked away from the hospital after the\ndiagnosis she formed a sudden and strong intuition: “This disease wanted to\nmonopolize my attention, but as much as possible, I would focus on my life instead.”\nThe cancer treatment that followed was exhausting and terrible, but Gallagher couldn’t\nhelp noticing, in that corner of her brain honed by a career in nonfiction writing, that\nher commitment to focus on what was good in her life—“movies, walks, and a 6:30\nmartini”—worked surprisingly well. Her life during this period should have been\nmired in fear and pity, but it was instead, she noted, often quite pleasant.\nHer curiosity piqued, Gallagher set out to better understand the role that attention—\nthat is, what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore—plays in defining\nthe quality of our life. After five years of science reporting, she came away convinced\nthat she was witness to a “grand unified theory” of the mind:\nLike fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from\nanthropology to education, behavioral economics to family counseling,\nsimilarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non\nof the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your\n\f\nexperience.\nThis concept upends the way most people think about their subjective experience\nof life. We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our \ncircumstances\n, assuming that what\nhappens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we feel. From this perspective, the\nsmall-scale details of how you spend your day aren’t that important, because what\nmatters are the large-scale outcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or\nmove to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict\nthis understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on \nwhat we pay\nattention to\n. If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and\ndark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more\npleasant—even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same. As Gallagher\nsummarizes: “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of\nwhat you focus on.”\nIn \nRapt\n, Gallagher surveys the research supporting this understanding of the mind.\nShe cites, for example, the University of North Carolina psychologist Barbara\nFredrickson: a researcher who specializes in the cognitive appraisal of emotions.\nAfter a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, \nFredrickson’s research shows, what\nyou choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward.\nThese simple choices can provide a “reset button” to your emotions. She provides the\nexample of a couple fighting over inequitable splitting of household chores. “Rather\nthan continuing to focus on your partner’s selfishness and sloth,” she suggests, “you\nmight focus on the fact that at least a festering conflict has been aired, which is the first\nstep toward a solution to the problem, and to your improved mood.” This seems like a\nsimple exhortation to look on the bright side, but Fredrickson found that skillful use of\nthese emotional “leverage points” can generate a significantly more positive outcome\nafter negative events.\nScientists can watch this effect in action all the way down to the neurological\nlevel. Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen, to name one such example, used an\nfMRI scanner to study the brain behavior of subjects presented with both positive and\nnegative imagery. She found that for young people, their amygdala (a center of\nemotion) fired with activity at both types of imagery. When she instead scanned the\nelderly, the amygdala fired only for the positive images. Carstensen hypothesizes that\nthe elderly subjects had trained the prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the\npresence of negative stimuli. These elderly subjects were not happier because their\nlife circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead\nhappier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the\npositive. By skillfully managing their \nattention, they improved their world without\n\f\nchanging anything concrete about it.\nWe can now step back and use Gallagher’s grand theory to better understand the role\nof deep work in cultivating a good life. This theory tells us that your world is the\noutcome of what you pay attention to, so consider for a moment the type of mental\nworld constructed when you dedicate significant time to deep endeavors. There’s a\ngravity and sense of importance inherent in deep work—whether you’re Ric Furrer\nsmithing a sword or a computer programmer optimizing an algorithm. Gallagher’s\ntheory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will\nunderstand your world as rich in meaning and importance.\nThere is, however, a hidden but equally important benefit to cultivating rapt\nattention in your workday: Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus,\npreventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that\nunavoidably and persistently populate our lives. (The psychologist Mihaly\nCsikszentmihalyi, whom we’ll learn more about in the next section, explicitly\nidentifies this advantage when he emphasizes the advantage of cultivating\n“concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything\nirrelevant, or to worry about problems.”) This danger is especially pronounced in\nknowledge work, which due to its dependence on ubiquitous connectivity generates a\ndevastatingly appealing buffet of distraction—most of which will, if given enough\nattention, \nleach meaning and importance from the world constructed by your mind.\nTo help make this claim more concrete I’ll use myself as a test case. Consider, for\nexample, the last five e-mails I sent before I began writing the first draft of this\nchapter. Following are the subject lines of these messages along with summaries of\ntheir contents:\n• \nRe: URGENT calnewport Brand Registration Confirmation.\n This message\nwas in response to a standard scam in which a company tries to trick website\nowners into registering their domain in China. I was annoyed that they kept\nspamming me, so I lost my cool and responded (futilely, of course) by telling\nthem their scam would be more convincing if they spelled “website” correctly in\ntheir e-mails.\n• \nRe: S R.\n This message was a conversation with a family member about an\narticle he saw in the \nWall Street Journal\n.\n• \nRe: Important Advice.\n This e-mail was part of a conversation about optimal\nretirement investment strategies.\n\f\n• \nRe: Fwd: Study Hacks.\n This e-mail was part of a conversation in which I was\nattempting to find a time to meet with someone I know who was visiting my city\n—a task complicated by his fractured schedule during his visit.\n• \nRe: just curious.\n This message was part of a conversation in which a colleague\nand I were reacting to \nsome thorny office politics issues (of the type that are\nfrequent and clichéd in academic departments).\nThese e-mails provide a nice case study of the type of shallow concerns that vie\nfor your attention in a knowledge work setting. Some of the issues presented in these\nsample messages are benign, such as discussing an interesting article, some are\nvaguely stressful, such as the conversation on retirement savings strategies (a type of\nconversation which almost always concludes with you \nnot\n doing the right things),\nsome are frustrating, such as trying to arrange a meeting around busy schedules, and\nsome are explicitly negative, such as angry responses to scammers or worried\ndiscussions about office politics.\nMany knowledge workers spend most of their working day interacting with these\ntypes of shallow concerns. Even when they’re required to complete something more\ninvolved, the habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that these issues remain at\nthe forefront of their attention. Gallagher teaches us that this is a foolhardy way to go\nabout your day, as it ensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your\nworking life that’s dominated by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality. The world\nrepresented by your inbox, in other words, isn’t a pleasant world to inhabit.\nEven if your colleagues are all genial and your interactions are always upbeat and\npositive, by allowing your attention to drift over the seductive landscape of the\nshallow, you run the risk of falling into another neurological trap identified by\nGallagher: “Five years of reporting on attention have \nconfirmed some home truths,”\nGallagher reports. “[Among them is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is the devil’s\nworkshop’… when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong\nwith your life instead of what’s right.” A workday driven by the shallow, from a\nneurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of\nthe shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun.\nThe implication of these findings is clear. In work (and especially knowledge\nwork), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex\nmachinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons\nmaximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life. “After\nrunning my tough experiment [with cancer]… I have a plan for living the rest of my\n\f\nlife,” Gallagher concludes in her book. “I’ll choose my targets with care… then give\nthem my rapt attention. In short, I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind\nthere is.” We’d be wise to follow her lead.\nA Psychological Argument for Depth\nOur second argument for why depth generates meaning comes from the work of one of\nthe world’s best-known (and most misspelled) psychologists, Mihaly\nCsikszentmihalyi. In the early 1980s, Csikszentmihalyi, working with Reed Larson, a\nyoung colleague at the University of Chicago, invented a new technique for\nunderstanding the psychological impact of everyday behaviors. At the time, it was\ndifficult \nto accurately measure the psychological impact of different activities. If you\nbrought someone into a laboratory and asked her to remember how she felt at a\nspecific point many hours ago, she was unlikely to recall. If you instead gave her a\ndiary and asked her to record how she felt throughout the day, she wouldn’t be likely\nto keep up the entries with diligence—it’s simply too much work.\nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson’s breakthrough was to leverage new technology (for\nthe time) to bring the question to the subject right when it mattered. In more detail, they\noutfitted experimental subjects with pagers. These pagers would beep at randomly\nselected intervals (in modern incarnations of this method, smartphone apps play the\nsame role). When the beeper went off, the subjects would record what they were\ndoing at the exact moment and how they felt. In some cases, they would be provided\nwith a journal in which to record this information while in others they would be given\na phone number to call to answer questions posed by a field-worker. Because the\nbeeps were only occasional but hard to ignore, the subjects were likely to follow\nthrough with the experimental procedure. And because the subjects were recording\nresponses about an activity \nat the very moment\n they were engaged in it, the responses\nwere more accurate. Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience\nsampling method (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually\nfeel about the beats of our daily lives.\nAmong many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a\ntheory he had been developing \nover the preceding decade: “The best moments usually\noccur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to\naccomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental\nstate \nflow\n (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). At the time, this\nfinding pushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still do)\nthat relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the"

    "raw_text": "hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most\npeople have this wrong:\nIronically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow\nactivities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of\nwhich encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and\nlose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires\nmuch greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.\nWhen measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing\nthan they suspected. And as the ESM studies confirmed, the more such flow\nexperiences that occur in a given week, the higher the subject’s life satisfaction.\nHuman beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something\nchallenging.\nThere is, of course, overlap between the theory of flow and the ideas of Winifred\nGallagher highlighted in the last section. Both point toward the importance of depth\nover shallowness, but they focus on two different explanations \nfor this importance.\nGallagher’s writing emphasizes that the \ncontent\n of what we focus on matters. If we\ngive rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative\nthings, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive.\nCsikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our\nattention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his\ntheory notes that the feeling of going deep is \nin itself\n very rewarding. Our minds like\nthis challenge, regardless of the subject.\nThe connection between deep work and flow should be clear: Deep work is an\nactivity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by Csikszentmihalyi to\ndescribe what generates flow include notions of stretching your mind to its limits,\nconcentrating, and losing yourself in an activity—all of which also describe deep\nwork). And as we just learned, flow generates happiness. Combining these two ideas\nwe get a powerful argument from psychology in favor of depth. Decades of research\nstemming from Csikszentmihalyi’s original ESM experiments validate that the act of\ngoing deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile.\nCsikszentmihalyi even goes so far as to argue that modern companies should embrace\nthis reality, suggesting that “jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely\nas possible flow activities.” Noting, however, that such a redesign would be difficult\nand disruptive (see, for example, my arguments from the previous chapter),\nCsikszentmihalyi then explains that it’s even more important that the \nindividual\n \nlearn\nhow to seek out opportunities for flow. This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away\n\f\nwith from our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: To build your\nworking life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to\ndeep satisfaction.\nA Philosophical Argument for Depth\nOur final argument for the connection between depth and meaning requires us to step\nback from the more concrete worlds of neuroscience and psychology and instead\nadopt a philosophical perspective. I’ll turn for help in this discussion to a pair of\nscholars who know this topic well: Hubert Dreyfus, who taught philosophy at\nBerkeley for more than four decades, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who at the time of this\nwriting is the chair of Harvard’s philosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly\npublished a book, \nAll Things Shining\n, which explores how notions of sacredness and\nmeaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. They set out to\nreconstruct this history because they’re worried about its endpoint in our current era.\n“The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,”\nDreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The shining things now seem far away.”\nWhat happened between then and now? The short answer, the authors argue, is\nDescartes. From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief that the individual\nseeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth. The resulting Enlightenment,\nof course, led to the concept \nof human rights and freed many from oppression. But as\nDreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for all its good in the political arena, in the domain of\nthe metaphysical this thinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential\nto creating meaning. In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked \nourselves\n to\nidentify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and\ninduce a creeping nihilism. “The Enlightenment’s metaphysical embrace of the\nautonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it\nleads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.”\nThis problem might at first seem far removed from our quest to understand the\nsatisfaction of depth, but when we proceed to Dreyfus and Kelly’s solution, we will\ndiscover rich new insights into the sources of meaning in professional pursuits. This\nconnection should seem less surprising when it’s revealed that Dreyfus and Kelly’s\nresponse to modern nihilism builds on the very subject that opened this chapter: the\ncraftsman.\nCraftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key\nto reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. To illustrate this claim,"

    "raw_text": "they use as an organizing example an account of a master wheelwright—the now lost\nprofession of shaping wooden wagon wheels. “Because each piece of wood is\ndistinct, it has its own personality,” they write after a passage describing the details of\nthe wheelwright’s craft. “The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood\nhe works. Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this\nappreciation for the “subtle \nvirtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has\nstumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning\nsited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide arbitrarily which virtues\nof the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the\nwood and the task it’s meant to perform.\nAs Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to craftsmanship. The\ntask of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to \ngenerate\n meaning, but rather to \ncultivate\nin himself the skill of \ndiscerning\n the meanings that are \nalready there\n.” This frees the\ncraftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of\nmeaning. At the same time, this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous\neras. The wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality of a\npiece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy.\nReturning to the question of professional satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s\ninterpretation of craftsmanship as a path to meaning provides a nuanced understanding\nof why the work of those like Ric Furrer resonates with so many of us. The look of\nsatisfaction on Furrer’s face as he works to extract artistry from crude metals, these\nphilosophers would argue, is a look expressing appreciation for something elusive and\nvaluable in modernity: a glimpse of the sacred.\nOnce understood, we can connect this sacredness inherent in traditional\ncraftsmanship to the world of knowledge work. To do so, there are two key\nobservations we must first make. The first might be obvious but requires emphasis:\nThere’s nothing intrinsic about the \nmanual\n trades when it comes to generating this\nparticular source of meaning. Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports\nhigh levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.\nTo elaborate this point, let’s jump from the old-fashioned examples of carving\nwood or smithing metal to the modern example of computer programming. Consider\nthis quote from the coding prodigy Santiago Gonzalez describing his work to an\ninterviewer:\nBeautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to\nanother programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s\nmuch like as if you were writing a poem.\n\f\nGonzalez discusses computer programming similarly to the way woodworkers\ndiscuss their craft in the passages quoted by Dreyfus and Kelly.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer\n, a well-regarded book in the computer programming\nfield, makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly\nby quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed in its preface: “We who cut mere\nstones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book then elaborates that\ncomputer programmers must see their work in the same way:\nWithin the overall structure of a project there is always room for\nindividuality and craftsmanship… One hundred years from now, our\nengineering may seem as \narchaic as the techniques used by medieval\ncathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship\nwill still be honored.\nYou don’t, in other words, need to be toiling in an open-air barn for your efforts to\nbe considered the type of craftsmanship that can generate Dreyfus and Kelly’s\nmeaning. A similar potential for craftsmanship can be found in most skilled jobs in the\ninformation economy. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your\nwork is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like\nthe skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your\nprofessional life.\nIt’s here that some might respond that \ntheir\n knowledge work job cannot possibly\nbecome such a source of meaning because their job’s subject is much too mundane.\nBut this is flawed thinking that our consideration of traditional craftsmanship can help\ncorrect. In our current culture, we place a lot of emphasis on job description. Our\nobsession with the advice to “follow your passion” (the subject of my last book), for\nexample, is motivated by the (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career\nsatisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose. In this way of thinking, there are\nsome rarified jobs that can be a source of satisfaction—perhaps working in a\nnonprofit or starting a software company—while all others are soulless and bland.\nThe philosophy of Dreyfus and Kelly frees us from such traps. The craftsmen they cite\ndon’t have rarified jobs. Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a\nwheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But \nthis doesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work\nare irrelevant. The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and\nappreciation inherent in craftsmanship—not the outcomes of their work. Put another\nway, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to\nknowledge work. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach\nto your work.\n\f\nThe second key observation about this line of argument is that cultivating\ncraftsmanship is necessarily a deep task and therefore requires a commitment to deep\nwork. (Recall that I argued in Chapter 1 that deep work is necessary to hone skills and\nto then apply them at an elite level—the core activities in craft.) Deep work, therefore,\nis key to extracting meaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus\nand Kelly. It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to direct it\ntoward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job\nfrom a distracted, draining obligation into something satisfying—a portal to a world\nfull of shining, wondrous things.\nHomo Sapiens Deepensis\nThe first two chapters of Part 1 were pragmatic. They argued that deep work is\nbecoming increasingly valuable in our economy at the same time that it also is\nbecoming increasingly rare (for somewhat arbitrary reasons). This represents a\nclassic market mismatch: If you cultivate this skill, you’ll thrive professionally.\nThis final chapter, by contrast, has little to add to this practical discussion of\nworkplace advancement, \nand yet\n it’s absolutely necessary for these earlier ideas to\ngain traction. The pages ahead describe a rigorous program for transforming your\nprofessional life into one centered on depth. This is a difficult transition, and as with\nmany such efforts, well-reasoned, pragmatic arguments can motivate you only to a\ncertain point. Eventually, the goal you pursue needs to resonate at a more human level.\nThis chapter argues that when it comes to the embrace of depth, such resonance is\ninevitable. Whether you approach the activity of going deep from the perspective of\nneuroscience, psychology, or lofty philosophy, these paths all seem to lead back to a\nconnection between depth and meaning. It’s as if our species has evolved into one that\nflourishes in depth and wallows in shallowness, becoming what we might call \nHomo\nsapiens deepensis\n.\nI earlier quoted Winifred Gallagher, the converted disciple of depth, saying, “I’ll\nlive the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” This is perhaps the best way\nto sum up the argument of this chapter and of Part 1 more broadly: A deep life is a\ngood life, any way you look at it."

    "raw_text": "PART 2\nThe Rules\n\f\nRule #1\nWork Deeply\nSoon after I met David Dewane for a drink at a Dupont Circle bar, he brought up the\nEudaimonia Machine. Dewane is an architecture professor, and therefore likes to\nexplore the intersection between the conceptual and the concrete. The Eudaimonia\nMachine is a good example of this intersection. The machine, which takes its name\nfrom the ancient Greek concept of \neudaimonia\n (a state in which you’re achieving your\nfull human potential), turns out to be a building. “The goal of the machine,” David\nexplained, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human\nflourishing—creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.” It\nis, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest\npossible deep work. I was, as you might expect, intrigued.\nAs Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its proposed\nlayout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in\na line, one after another. There’s no shared hallway: you have to pass through one\nroom to get to the next. As Dewane explains, “[The lack of circulation] is critical\nbecause it doesn’t allow \nyou to bypass any of the spaces as you get deeper into the\nmachine.”\nThe first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery. In\nDewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work produced in the\nbuilding. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a “culture of healthy\nstress and peer pressure.”\nAs you leave the gallery, you next enter the salon. In here, Dewane imagines access\nto high-quality coffee and perhaps even a full bar. There are also couches and Wi-Fi.\nThe salon is designed to create a mood that “hovers between intense curiosity and\nargumentation.” This is a place to debate, “brood,” and in general work through the\nideas that you’ll develop deeper in the machine.\nBeyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent record of all\nwork produced in the machine, as well as the books and other resources used in this\nprevious work. There will be copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting the\n\f\ninformation you need for your project. Dewane describes the library as “the hard\ndrive of the machine.”\nThe next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference room with a\nwhiteboard and some cubicles with desks. “The office,” Dewane explains, “is for\nlow-intensity activity.” To use our terminology, this is the space to complete the\nshallow efforts required by your project. Dewane imagines an administrator with a\ndesk in the office who could help its users improve their work habits to optimize their\nefficiency.\nThis brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what Dewane calls\n“deep work chambers” (he \nadopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the\ntopic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick\nsoundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The\npurpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work\nflow,” Dewane explains. He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes\ninside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your\nbrain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day.\nFor now, the Eudaimonia Machine exists only as a collection of architectural\ndrawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful work excites Dewane.\n“[This design] remains, in my mind, the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve\never produced,” he told me.\nIn an ideal world—one in which the true value of deep work is accepted and\ncelebrated—we’d all have access to something like the Eudaimonia Machine. Perhaps\nnot David Dewane’s exact design, but, more generally speaking, a work environment\n(and culture) designed to help us extract as much value as possible from our brains.\nUnfortunately, this vision is far from our current reality. We instead find ourselves in\ndistracting open offices where inboxes cannot be neglected and meetings are incessant\n—a setting where colleagues would rather you respond quickly to their latest e-mail\nthan produce the best possible results. As a reader of this book, in other words, you’re\na disciple of depth in a shallow world.\nThis rule—the first of four such rules in Part 2 of this book—is designed to reduce\nthis conflict. You might not \nhave access to your own Eudaimonia Machine, but the\nstrategies that follow will help you simulate its effects in your otherwise distracted\nprofessional life. They’ll show you how to transform deep work from an aspiration\ninto a regular and significant part of your daily schedule. (Rules #2 through #4 will\nthen help you get the most out of this deep work habit by presenting, among other\nthings, strategies for training your concentration ability and fighting back encroaching"

    "raw_text": "distractions.)\nBefore proceeding to these strategies, however, I want to first address a question\nthat might be nagging you: Why do we need such involved interventions? Put another\nway, once you accept that deep work is valuable, isn’t it enough to just start doing\nmore of it? Do we really need something as complicated as the Eudaimonia Machine\n(or its equivalent) for something as simple as remembering to concentrate more often?\nUnfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so\nsimple. To understand why this is true let’s take a closer look at one of the main\nobstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more\nsuperficial. Most people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate\non hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength.\nConsider a 2012 study, led by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy\nBaumeister, that outfitted 205 adults with beepers that activated at randomly selected\ntimes (this is the experience sampling method discussed in Part 1). When the beeper\nsounded, the subject was asked to pause for a moment to reflect on desires that he or\nshe was currently \nfeeling or had felt in the last thirty minutes, and then answer a set of\nquestions about these desires. After a week, the researchers had gathered more than\n7,500 samples. Here’s the short version of what they found: \nPeople fight desires all\nday long\n. As Baumeister summarized in his subsequent book, \nWillpower\n (co-authored\nwith the science writer John Tierney): “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the\nexception.”\nThe five most common desires these subjects fought include, not surprisingly,\neating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five list also included desires for “taking a break\nfrom [hard] work… checking e-mail and social networking sites, surfing the web,\nlistening to music, or watching television.” The lure of the Internet and television\nproved especially strong: The subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly\naddictive distractions only around half the time.\nThese results are bad news for this rule’s goal of helping you cultivate a deep\nwork habit. They tell us that you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do\nanything \nbut\n work deeply throughout the day, and if you’re like the German subjects\nfrom the Hofmann and Baumeister study, these competing desires will often win out.\nYou might respond at this point that \nyou\n will succeed where these subjects failed\nbecause you understand the importance of depth and will therefore be more rigorous in\nyour will to remain concentrated. This is a noble sentiment, but the decades of\nresearch that preceded this study underscore its futility. A now voluminous line of\ninquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has"

    "raw_text": "established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) \ntruth about\nwillpower: \nYou have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use\nit\n.\nYour will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that you can\ndeploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is why the subjects in\nthe Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard time fighting desires—over time\nthese distractions drained their finite pool of willpower until they could no longer\nresist. The same will happen to you, regardless of your intentions—unless, that is,\nyou’re smart about your habits.\nThis brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to\ndeveloping a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add \nroutines\n and\nrituals\n to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited\nwillpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.\nIf you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent Web\nbrowsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, you’ll draw\nheavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online\nshininess. Such attempts will therefore frequently fail. On the other hand, if you\ndeployed smart routines and rituals—perhaps a set time and quiet location used for\nyour deep tasks each afternoon—you’d require much less willpower to start and keep\ngoing. In the long run, you’d therefore succeed with these deep efforts far more often.\nWith this in mind, the six strategies that follow can be understood as an arsenal of\nroutines and rituals designed with the science of limited willpower in mind to\nmaximize \nthe amount of deep work you consistently accomplish in your schedule.\nAmong other things, they’ll ask you to commit to a particular pattern for scheduling\nthis work and develop rituals to sharpen your concentration before starting each\nsession. Some of these strategies will deploy simple heuristics to hijack your brain’s\nmotivation center while others are designed to recharge your willpower reserves at\nthe fastest possible rate.\nYou could just try to make deep work a priority. But supporting this decision with\nthe strategies that follow—or strategies of your own devising that are motivated by the\nsame principles—will significantly increase the probability that you succeed in\nmaking deep work a crucial part of your professional life.\nDecide on Your Depth Philosophy\nThe famed computer scientist Donald Knuth cares about deep work. As he explains on\n\f\nhis website: “What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible\nconcentration.” A doctoral candidate named Brian Chappell, who is a father with a\nfull-time job, also values deep work, as it’s the only way he can make progress on his\ndissertation given his limited time. Chappell told me that his first encounter with the\nidea of deep work was “an emotional moment.”\nI mention these examples because although Knuth and Chappell agree on the\nimportance of depth, they disagree on their \nphilosophies\n for integrating this depth into\ntheir work lives. As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of\nmonasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying \nto eliminate or minimize all other\ntypes of work. Chappell, by contrast, deploys a rhythmic strategy in which he works\nfor the same hours (five to seven thirty a.m.) every weekday morning, without\nexception, before beginning a workday punctuated by standard distractions. Both\napproaches work, but not universally. Knuth’s approach might make sense for\nsomeone whose primary professional obligation is to think big thoughts, but if\nChappell adopted a similar rejection of all things shallow, he’d likely lose his job.\nYou need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional\nlife. (As argued in this rule’s introduction, attempting to schedule deep work in an ad\nhoc fashion is not an effective way to manage your limited willpower.) But this\nexample highlights a general warning about this selection: You must be careful to\nchoose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can\nderail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify. This strategy will help\nyou avoid this fate by presenting four different depth philosophies that I’ve seen work\nexceptionally well in practice. The goal is to convince you that there are many\ndifferent ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s therefore worth\ntaking the time to find an approach that makes sense for you.\nThe Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nLet’s return to Donald Knuth. He’s famous for many innovations in computer science,\nincluding, notably, the development of a rigorous approach to analyzing algorithm\nperformance. \nAmong his peers, however, Knuth also maintains an aura of infamy for\nhis approach to electronic communication. If you visit Knuth’s website at Stanford\nwith the intention of finding his e-mail address, you’ll instead discover the following\nnote:\nI have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an\nemail address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15\n\f\nyears of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for\npeople whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is\nto be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and\nuninterruptible concentration.\nKnuth goes on to acknowledge that he doesn’t intend to cut himself off completely\nfrom the world. He notes that writing his books requires communication with\nthousands of people and that he wants to be responsive to questions and comments.\nHis solution? He provides an address—a \npostal mailing\n address. He says that his\nadministrative assistant will sort through any letters arriving at that address and put\naside those that she thinks are relevant. Anything that’s truly urgent she’ll bring to\nKnuth promptly, and everything else he’ll handle in a big batch, once every three\nmonths or so.\nKnuth deploys what I call the \nmonastic philosophy\n of deep work scheduling. This\nphilosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing\nshallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-\ndefined and highly valued professional goal that \nthey’re pursuing, and the bulk of their\nprofessional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. It’s this\nclarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up\nthose whose value proposition in the working world is more varied.\nKnuth, for example, explains his professional goal as follows: “I try to learn\ncertain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into\na form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for such study.” Trying to\npitch Knuth on the intangible returns of building an audience on Twitter, or the\nunexpected opportunities that might come through a more liberal use of e-mail, will\nfail, as these behaviors don’t directly aid his goal to exhaustively understand specific\ncorners of computer science and then write about them in an accessible manner.\nAnother person committed to monastic deep work is the acclaimed science fiction\nwriter Neal Stephenson. If you visit Stephenson’s author website, you’ll notice a lack\nof e-mail or mailing address. We can gain insight into this omission from a pair of\nessays that Stephenson posted on his early website (hosted on The Well) back in the\nearly 2000s, and which have been preserved by the Internet Archive. In one such\nessay, archived in 2003, Stephenson summarizes his communication policy as\nfollows:\nPersons who wish to interfere with my concentration are politely requested\nnot to do so, and warned that I don’t answer e-mail… lest [my\ncommunication policy’s] key message get lost in the verbiage, I will put it\n\f\nhere \nsuccinctly: All of my time and attention are spoken for—several times\nover. Please do not ask for them.\nTo further justify this policy, Stephenson wrote an essay titled “Why I Am a Bad\nCorrespondent.” At the core of his explanation for his inaccessibility is the following\ndecision:\nThe productivity equation is a non-linear one, in other words. This accounts\nfor why I am a bad correspondent and why I very rarely accept speaking\nengagements. If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long,\nconsecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those\nchunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops\nspectacularly.\nStephenson sees two mutually exclusive options: He can write good novels at a\nregular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and attend conferences, and\nas a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower rate. He chose the former option,\nand this choice requires him to avoid as much as possible any source of shallow work\nin his professional life. (This issue is so important to Stephenson that he went on to\nexplore its implications—positive and negative—in his 2008 science fiction epic,\nAnathem\n, which considers a world where an intellectual elite live in monastic orders,\nisolated from the distracted masses and technology, thinking deep thoughts.)\nIn my experience, the monastic philosophy makes many knowledge workers\ndefensive. The clarity with which its adherents identify their value to the world, I\nsuspect, touches \na raw nerve for those whose contribution to the information economy\nis more complex. Notice, of course, that “more complex” does not mean “lesser.” A\nhigh-level manager, for example, might play a vital role in the functioning of a billion-\ndollar company, even if she cannot point to something discrete, like a completed\nnovel, and say, “This is what I produced this year.” Therefore, the pool of individuals\nto whom the monastic philosophy applies is limited—and that’s okay. If you’re\noutside this pool, its radical simplicity shouldn’t evince too much envy. On the other\nhand, if you’re inside this pool—someone whose contribution to the world is discrete,\nclear, and individualized\n*\n—then you should give this philosophy serious\nconsideration, as it might be the deciding factor between an average career and one\nthat will be remembered.\nThe Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nThis book opened with a story about the revolutionary psychologist and thinker Carl\n\f\nJung. In the 1920s, at the same time that Jung was attempting to break away from the\nstrictures of his mentor, Sigmund Freud, he began regular retreats to a \nrustic stone\nhouse he built in the woods outside the small town of Bollingen. When there, Jung\nwould lock himself every morning into a minimally appointed room to write without\ninterruption. He would then meditate and walk in the woods to clarify his thinking in\npreparation for the next day’s writing. These efforts, I argued, were aimed at\nincreasing the intensity of Jung’s deep work to a level that would allow him to\nsucceed in intellectual combat with Freud and his many supporters.\nIn recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung did \nnot\ndeploy a monastic approach to deep work. Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, our\nexamples from earlier, attempted to completely eliminate distraction and shallowness\nfrom their professional lives. Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the\nperiods he spent at his retreat. The rest of Jung’s time was spent in Zurich, where his\nlife was anything but monastic: He ran a busy clinical practice that often had him\nseeing patients until late at night; he was an active participant in the Zurich\ncoffeehouse culture; and he gave and attended many lectures in the city’s respected\nuniversities. (Einstein received his doctorate from one university in Zurich and later\ntaught at another; he also, interestingly enough, knew Jung, and the two shared several\ndinners to discuss the key ideas of Einstein’s special relativity.) Jung’s life in Zurich,\nin other words, is similar in many ways to the modern archetype of the hyperconnected\ndigital-age knowledge worker: Replace “Zurich” with “San Francisco” and “letter”\nwith “tweet” and we could be discussing some hotshot tech CEO.\nJung’s approach is what I call the \nbimodal philosophy\n of deep work. This\nphilosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to\ndeep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the\nbimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted\nconcentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of\ntime between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale\nof a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time.\nSimilarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of\nyour deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).\nThe bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme\nproductivity, \nbut only if\n the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach\nmaximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why\nthe minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full\nday. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a\ndeep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.\n\f\nAt the same time, the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who\ncannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits. Jung,\nfor example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse\nscene to stimulate his thinking. The approach of shifting between two modes provides\na way to serve both needs well.\nTo provide a more modern example of the bimodal \nphilosophy in action, we can\nonce again consider Adam Grant, the Wharton Business School professor whose\nthoughtfulness about work habits was first introduced in Part 1. As you might recall,\nGrant’s schedule during his rapid rise through the professorship ranks at Wharton\nprovides a nice bimodality case study. On the scale of the academic year, he stacked\nhis courses into one semester, so that he could focus the other on deep work. During\nthese deep semesters he then applied the bimodal approach on the weekly scale. He\nwould, perhaps once or twice a month, take a period of two to four days to become\ncompletely monastic. He would shut his door, put an out-of-office auto-responder on\nhis e-mail, and work on his research without interruption. Outside of these deep\nsessions, Grant remained famously open and accessible. In some sense, he had to be:\nHis 2013 bestseller, \nGive and Take\n, promotes the practice of giving of your time and\nattention, without expectation of something in return, as a key strategy in professional\nadvancement.\nThose who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of\nthe monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in\ntheir working lives. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to implementing this philosophy is\nthat even short periods of deep work require a flexibility that many fear they lack in\ntheir current positions. If even an hour away from your inbox makes you\nuncomfortable, then certainly the idea of disappearing for a day or more at a time will\nseem impossible. But I suspect bimodal working is compatible with more types of\njobs than you might guess. Earlier, for example, I described a study \nby Harvard\nBusiness School professor Leslie Perlow. In this study, a group of management\nconsultants were asked to disconnect for a full day each workweek. The consultants\nwere afraid the client would rebel. It turned out that the client didn’t care. As Jung,\nGrant, and Perlow’s subjects discovered, people will usually respect your right to\nbecome inaccessible if these periods are well defined and well advertised, and\noutside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find.\nThe Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nIn the early days of the \nSeinfeld\n show, Jerry Seinfeld remained a working comic with\n\f\na busy tour schedule. It was during this period that a writer and comic named Brad\nIsaac, who was working open mic nights at the time, ran into Seinfeld at a club waiting\nto go on stage. As Isaac later explained in a now classic Lifehacker article: “I saw my\nchance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me\nwas something that would benefit me for a lifetime.”\nSeinfeld began his advice to Isaac with some common sense, noting “the way to be\na better comic was to create better jokes,” and then explaining that the way to create\nbetter jokes was to write every day. Seinfeld continued by describing a specific\ntechnique he used to help maintain this discipline. He keeps a calendar on his wall.\nEvery day that he writes jokes he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red \nX\n.\n“After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain\nwill grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a\nfew \nweeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”\nThis \nchain method\n (as some now call it) soon became a hit among writers and\nfitness enthusiasts—communities that thrive on the ability to do hard things\nconsistently. For our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to\nintegrating depth into your life: the \nrhythmic philosophy\n. This philosophy argues that\nthe easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a\nsimple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a \nrhythm\n for this work\nthat removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you’re going to\ngo deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work\nscheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day),\nwith an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red \nX\ns on the calendar.\nAnother common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual\naid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work.\nIn much the same way that maintaining visual indicators of your work progress can\nreduce the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating even the simplest scheduling\ndecisions, such as when during the day to do the work, also reduces this barrier.\nConsider the example of Brian Chappell, the busy doctoral candidate I introduced\nin the opening to this strategy. Chappell adopted the rhythmic philosophy of deep work\nscheduling out of necessity. Around the time that he was ramping up his dissertation\nwriting he was offered a \nfull-time job at a center on the campus where he was a\nstudent. Professionally, this was a good opportunity and Chappell was happy to accept\nit. But academically, a full-time job, especially when coupled with the recent arrival\nof Chappell’s first child, made it difficult to find the depth needed to write thesis\nchapters.\n\f\nChappell began by attempting a vague commitment to deep work. He made a rule\nthat deep work needed to happen in ninety-minute chunks (recognizing correctly that it\ntakes time to ease into a state of concentration) and he decided he would try to\nschedule these chunks in an ad hoc manner whenever appropriate openings in his\nschedule arose. Not surprisingly, this strategy didn’t yield much productivity. In a\ndissertation boot camp Chappell had attended the year before, he’d managed to\nproduce a full thesis chapter in a single week of rigorous deep work. After he\naccepted his full-time job, he managed to produce only a single additional chapter in\nthe entire first year\n he was working.\nIt was the glacial writing progress during this year that drove Chappell to embrace\nthe rhythmic method. He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five\nthirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to\nwork already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early\nprogress, he soon pushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more\nmorning depth.\nWhen I interviewed Chappell for this book, he described his rhythmic approach to\ndeep work scheduling as “both astronomically productive and guilt free.” His routine\nwas \nproducing four to five pages of academic prose per day and was capable of\ngenerating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter \nevery two or three weeks\n:\na phenomenal output for someone who also worked a nine-to-five job. “Who’s to say\nthat I can’t be that prolific?” he concluded. “Why not me?”\nThe rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal\nphilosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought\nin the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off,\nhowever, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By\nsupporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a\nregular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours\nper year.\nThe decision between rhythmic and bimodal can come down to your self-control in\nsuch scheduling matters. If you’re Carl Jung and are engaged in an intellectual dogfight\nwith Sigmund Freud’s supporters, you’ll likely have no trouble recognizing the\nimportance of finding time to focus on your ideas. On the other hand, if you’re writing\na dissertation with no one pressuring you to get it done, the habitual nature of the\nrhythmic philosophy might be necessary to maintain progress.\nFor many, however, it’s not just self-control issues that bias them toward the\nrhythmic philosophy, but also the reality that some jobs don’t allow you to disappear\n\f\nfor days at a time when the need to go deep arises. (For a lot of bosses, the standard is\nthat you’re free to focus as hard as you want… so long as the boss’s e-mails are still\nanswered promptly.) This \nis likely the biggest reason why the rhythmic philosophy is\none of the most common among deep workers in standard office jobs.\nThe Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling\nIn the 1980s, the journalist Walter Isaacson was in his thirties and well along in his\nrapid ascent through the ranks of \nTime\n magazine. By this point, he was undoubtedly on\nthe radar of the thinking class. Christopher Hitchens, for example, writing in the\nLondon Review of Books\n during this period, called him “one of the best magazine\njournalists in America.” The time was right for Isaacson to write a Big Important\nBook—a necessary step on the ladder of journalistic achievement. So Isaacson chose\na complicated topic, an intertwined narrative biography of six figures who played an\nimportant role in early Cold War policy, and teamed up with a fellow young \nTime\neditor, Evan Thomas, to produce an appropriately weighty book: an 864-page epic\ntitled \nThe Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made\n.\nThis book, which was published in 1986, was well received by the right people.\nThe \nNew York Times\n called it “a richly textured account,” while the \nSan Francisco\nChronicle\n exulted that the two young writers had “fashioned a Cold War Plutarch.”\nLess than a decade later, Isaacson reached the apex of his journalism career when he\nwas appointed editor of \nTime\n (which he then followed with a second act as the CEO\nof a think tank and an incredibly popular biographer of figures including Benjamin\nFranklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs).\nWhat interests me about Isaacson, however, is not \nwhat\n he accomplished with his\nfirst book but \nhow\n he wrote it. In uncovering this story, I must draw from a fortunate\npersonal connection. As it turns out, in the years leading up to the publication of \nThe\nWise Men\n, my uncle John Paul Newport, who was also a journalist in New York at\nthe time, shared a summer beach rental with Isaacson. To this day, my uncle\nremembers Isaacson’s impressive work habits:\nIt was always amazing… he could retreat up to the bedroom for a while,\nwhen the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his\nbook… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d hear the typewriter\npounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the rest of us… the work never\nseemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare\ntime.\n\f\nIsaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he would switch\ninto a deep work mode and hammer away at his book. This is how, it turns out, one\ncan write a nine-hundred-page book on the side while spending the bulk of one’s day\nbecoming one of the country’s best magazine writers.\nI call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your\nschedule, the \njournalist philosophy\n. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like\nWalter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is\nrequired by the deadline-driven nature of their profession.\nThis approach is not for the deep work novice. As I established in the opening to\nthis rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t\ncome naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite\nwillpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities—\na conviction that what you’re doing is important and will succeed. This type of\nconviction is typically built on a foundation of existing professional accomplishment.\nIsaacson, for example, likely had an easier time switching to writing mode than, say, a\nfirst-time novelist, because Isaacson had worked himself up to become a respected\nwriter by this point. He \nknew\n he had the capacity to write an epic biography and\nunderstood it to be a key task in his professional advancement. This confidence goes a\nlong way in motivating hard efforts.\nI’m partial to the journalistic philosophy of deep work because it’s my main\napproach to integrating these efforts into my schedule. In other words, I’m not\nmonastic in my deep work (though I do find myself occasionally jealous of my fellow\ncomputer scientist Donald Knuth’s unapologetic disconnection), I don’t deploy\nmultiday depth binges like the bimodalists, and though I am intrigued by the rhythmic\nphilosophy, my schedule has a way of thwarting attempts to enforce a daily habit.\nInstead, in an ode to Isaacson, I face each week as it arrives and do my best to squeeze\nout as much depth as possible. To write this book, for example, I had to take\nadvantage of free stretches of time wherever they popped up. If my kids were taking a\ngood nap, I’d grab my laptop and lock myself in the home office. If my wife wanted \nto\nvisit her parents in nearby Annapolis on a weekend day, I’d take advantage of the\nextra child care to disappear to a quiet corner of their house to write. If a meeting at\nwork was canceled, or an afternoon left open, I might retreat to one of my favorite\nlibraries on campus to squeeze out a few hundred more words. And so on.\nI should admit that I’m not pure in my application of the journalist philosophy. I\ndon’t, for example, make all my deep work decisions on a moment-to-moment basis. I\ninstead tend to map out when I’ll work deeply during each week at the beginning of the\n\f\nweek, and then refine these decisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day (see\nRule #4 for more details on my scheduling routines). By reducing the need to make\ndecisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for\nthe deep thinking itself.\nIn the final accounting, the journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling\nremains difficult to pull off. But if you’re confident in the value of what you’re trying\nto produce, and practiced in the skill of going deep (a skill we will continue to\ndevelop in the strategies that follow), it can be a surprisingly robust way to squeeze\nout large amounts of depth from an otherwise demanding schedule.\nRitualize\nAn often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable\nthings is that they’re rarely haphazard in their work habits. Consider the Pulitzer\nPrize–winning biographer Robert Caro. As revealed in a 2009 \nmagazine profile,\n“every inch of [Caro’s] New York office is governed by rules.” Where he places his\nbooks, how he stacks his notebooks, what he puts on his wall, even what he wears to\nthe office: Everything is specified by a routine that has varied little over Caro’s long\ncareer. “I trained myself to be organized,” he explained.\nCharles Darwin had a similarly strict structure for his working life during the\nperiod when he was perfecting \nOn the Origin of Species.\n As his son Francis later\nremembered, he would rise promptly at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat\nbreakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was\ndedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his\nstudy from ten thirty until noon. After this session, he would mull over challenging\nideas while walking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then\ncircled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then\ndeclare his workday done.\nThe journalist Mason Currey, who spent half a decade cataloging the habits of\nfamous thinkers and writers (and from whom I learned the previous two examples),\nsummarized this tendency toward systematization as follows:\nThere is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there is\nsome strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where…\nbut I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a\nterrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps \nthe single best piece of advice I can\noffer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.\n\f\nIn a \nNew York Times\n column on the topic, David Brooks summarizes this reality\nmore bluntly: “[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.”\nThis strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work\nsessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important\nthinkers mentioned previously. There’s a good reason for this mimicry. Great minds\nlike Caro and Darwin didn’t deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in\ntheir work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again—there’s no way to\nwin a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limit.\nTheir rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go\ndeep more easily and stay in the state longer. If they had instead waited for inspiration\nto strike before settling in to serious work, their accomplishments would likely have\nbeen greatly reduced.\nThere’s no one \ncorrect\n deep work ritual—the right fit depends on both the person\nand the type of project pursued. But there are some general questions that any effective\nritual must address:\n• \nWhere you’ll work and for how long\n. Your ritual needs to specify a location\nfor your deep work efforts. This \nlocation can be as simple as your normal office with\nthe door shut and desk cleaned off (a colleague of mine likes to put a hotel-style “do\nnot disturb” sign on his office door when he’s tackling something difficult). If it’s\npossible to identify a location used \nonly\n for depth—for instance, a conference room or\nquiet library—the positive effect can be even greater. (If you work in an open office\nplan, this need to find a deep work retreat becomes particularly important.)\nRegardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to\nkeep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.\n• \nHow you’ll work once you start to work\n. Your ritual needs rules and\nprocesses to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on\nany Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute\ninterval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you’ll have to\nmentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these\nsessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard. These are\nunnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.\n• \nHow you’ll support your work\n. Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the\nsupport it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual\nmight specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to\n\f\nenough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as\nwalking \nto help keep the mind clear. (As Nietzsche said: “It is only ideas gained from\nwalking that have any worth.”) This support might also include environmental factors,\nsuch as organizing the raw materials of your work to minimize energy-dissipating\nfriction (as we saw with Caro’s example). To maximize your success, you need to\nsupport your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be\nsystematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the\nmoment.\nThese questions will help you get started in crafting your deep work ritual. But\nkeep in mind that finding a ritual that sticks might require experimentation, so be\nwilling to work at it. I assure you that the effort’s worth it: Once you’ve evolved\nsomething that feels right, the impact can be significant. To work deeply is a big deal\nand should not be an activity undertaken lightly. Surrounding such efforts with a\ncomplicated (and perhaps, to the outside world, quite strange) ritual accepts this\nreality—providing your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into\nthe state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter.\nMake Grand Gestures\nIn the early winter of 2007, J.K. Rowling was struggling to complete \nThe Deathly\nHallows\n, the final book in her Harry Potter series. The pressure was intense, as this\nbook bore the responsibility of tying together the six that preceded it in a way that\nwould satisfy the series’ hundreds of \nmillions of fans. Rowling needed to work deeply\nto satisfy these demands, but she was finding unbroken concentration increasingly\ndifficult to achieve at her home office in Edinburgh, Scotland. “As I was finishing\nDeathly Hallows\n there came a day where the window cleaner came, the kids were at\nhome, the dogs were barking,” Rowling recalled in an interview. It was too much, so\nJ.K. Rowling decided to do something extreme to shift her mind-set where it needed to\nbe: She checked into a suite in the five-star Balmoral Hotel, located in the heart of\ndowntown Edinburgh. “So I came to this hotel because it’s a beautiful hotel, but I\ndidn’t intend to stay here,” she explained. “[But] the first day’s writing went well so I\nkept coming back… and I ended up finishing the last of the \nHarry Potter\n books\n[here].”\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that Rowling ended up staying. The setting was\nperfect for her project. The Balmoral, known as one of Scotland’s most luxurious\nhotels, is a classic Victorian building complete with ornate stonework and a tall clock"

    "raw_text": "tower. It’s also located only a couple of blocks away from Edinburgh Castle—one of\nRowling’s inspirations in dreaming up Hogwarts.\nRowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is\nan example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: \nthe grand\ngesture\n. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal\nenvironment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all\ndedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance\nof the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct \nto procrastinate and\ndelivers an injection of motivation and energy.\nWriting a chapter of a Harry Potter novel, for example, is hard work and will\nrequire a lot of mental energy—regardless of where you do it. But when paying more\nthan $1,000 a day to write the chapter in a suite of an old hotel down the street from a\nHogwarts-style castle, \nmustering\n the energy to begin and sustain this work is easier\nthan if you were instead in a distracting home office.\nWhen you study the habits of other well-known deep workers, the grand gesture\nstrategy comes up often. Bill Gates, for example, was famous during his time as\nMicrosoft CEO for taking Think Weeks during which he would leave behind his\nnormal work and family obligations to retreat to a cabin with a stack of papers and\nbooks. His goal was to think deeply, without distraction, about the big issues relevant\nto his company. It was during one of these weeks, for example, that he famously came\nto the conclusion that the Internet was going to be a major force in the industry. There\nwas nothing physically stopping Gates from thinking deeply in his office in\nMicrosoft’s Seattle headquarters, but the novelty of his weeklong retreat helped him\nachieve the desired levels of concentration.\nThe MIT physicist and award-winning novelist Alan Lightman also leverages\ngrand gestures. In his case, he retreats each summer to a “tiny island” in Maine to think\ndeeply and recharge. At least as of 2000, when he described this gesture in an\ninterview, the island not only lacked Internet, but didn’t even have phone service. As\nhe then justified: \n“It’s really about two and a half months that I’ll feel like I can\nrecover some silence in my life… which is so hard to find.”\nNot everyone has the freedom to spend two months in Maine, but many writers,\nincluding Dan Pink and Michael Pollan, simulate the experience year-round by\nbuilding—often at significant expense and effort—writing cabins on their properties.\n(Pollan, for his part, even wrote a book about his experience building his cabin in the\nwoods behind his former Connecticut home.) These outbuildings aren’t strictly\nnecessary for these writers, who need only a laptop and a flat surface to put it on to\n\f\nply their trade. But it’s not the amenities of the cabins that generate their value; it’s\ninstead the grand gesture represented in the design and building of the cabin for the\nsole purpose of enabling better writing.\nNot every grand gesture need be so permanent. After the pathologically\ncompetitive Bell Labs physicist William Shockley was scooped in the invention of the\ntransistor—as I detail in the next strategy, two members of his team made the\nbreakthrough at a time when Shockley was away working on another project—he\nlocked himself in a hotel room in Chicago, where he had traveled ostensibly to attend\na conference. He didn’t emerge from the room until he had ironed out the details for a\nbetter design that had been rattling around in his mind. When he finally did leave the\nroom, he airmailed his notes back to Murray Hill, New Jersey, so that a colleague\ncould paste them into his lab notebook and sign them to timestamp the innovation. The\njunction form of the transistor that Shockley worked out in this burst of \ndepth ended up\nearning him a share of the Nobel Prize subsequently awarded for the invention.\nAn even more extreme example of a onetime grand gesture yielding results is a\nstory involving Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur and social media pioneer. As a\npopular speaker, Shankman spends much of his time flying. He eventually realized that\nthirty thousand feet was an ideal environment for him to focus. As he explained in a\nblog post, “Locked in a seat with nothing in front of me, nothing to distract me, nothing\nto set off my ‘Ooh! Shiny!’ DNA, I have nothing to do but be at one with my thoughts.”\nIt was sometime after this realization that Shankman signed a book contract that gave\nhim only two weeks to finish the entire manuscript. Meeting this deadline would\nrequire incredible concentration. To achieve this state, Shankman did something\nunconventional. He booked a round-trip business-class ticket to Tokyo. He wrote\nduring the whole flight to Japan, drank an espresso in the business class lounge once\nhe arrived in Japan, then turned around and flew back, once again writing the whole\nway—arriving back in the States only thirty hours after he first left with a completed\nmanuscript now in hand. “The trip cost $4,000 and was worth every penny,” he\nexplained.\nIn all of these examples, it’s not just the change of environment or seeking of quiet\nthat enables more depth. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so\nseriously to the task at hand. To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing\nproject, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel\nroom until you \ncomplete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to\na level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to\ngo deep, you must first go big.\n\f\nDon’t Work Alone\nThe relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It’s worth taking the\ntime to untangle, however, because properly leveraging collaboration can increase the\nquality of deep work in your professional life.\nIt’s helpful to start our discussion of this topic by taking a step back to consider\nwhat at first seems to be an unresolvable conflict. In Part 1 of this book I criticized\nFacebook for the design of its new headquarters. In particular, I noted that the\ncompany’s goal to create the world’s largest open office space—a giant room that\nwill reportedly hold twenty-eight hundred workers—represents an absurd attack on\nconcentration. Both intuition and a growing body of research underscore the reality\nthat sharing a workspace with a large number of coworkers is incredibly distracting—\ncreating an environment that thwarts attempts to think seriously. In a 2013 article\nsummarizing recent research on this topic, \nBloomberg Businessweek\n went so far as to\ncall for an end to the “tyranny of the open-plan office.”\nAnd yet, these open office designs are not embraced haphazardly. As Maria\nKonnikova reports in \nThe New Yorker\n, when this concept first emerged, its goal was\nto “facilitate communication and idea flow.” This claim resonated with \nAmerican\nbusinesses looking to embrace an aura of start-up unconventionality. Josh Tyrangiel,\nthe editor of \nBloomberg Businessweek\n, for example, explained the lack of offices in\nBloomberg’s headquarters as follows: “Open plan is pretty spectacular; it ensures that\neveryone is attuned to the broad mission, and… it encourages curiosity between\npeople who work in different disciplines.” Jack Dorsey justified the open layout of the\nSquare headquarters by explaining: “We encourage people to stay out in the open\nbecause we believe in serendipity—and people walking by each other teaching new\nthings.”\nFor the sake of discussion, let’s call this principle—that when you allow people to\nbump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerge—the \ntheory of\nserendipitous creativity\n. When Mark Zuckerberg decided to build the world’s largest\noffice, we can reasonably conjecture, this theory helped drive his decision, just as it\nhas driven many of the moves toward open workspaces elsewhere in Silicon Valley\nand beyond. (Other less-exalted factors, like saving money and increasing supervision,\nalso play a role, but they’re not as sexy and are therefore less emphasized.)\nThis decision between promoting concentration and promoting serendipity seems\nto indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is incompatible with generating\ncreative insights (a collaborative endeavor). This conclusion, however, is flawed. It’s\n\f\nbased, I argue, on an incomplete understanding of the theory of serendipitous\ncreativity. To support this claim, let’s consider the origins of this particular\nunderstanding of what spurs breakthroughs.\nThe theory in question has many sources, but I happen to have a personal\nconnection to one of the more well-known. During my seven years at MIT, I worked\non the site of the institute’s famed Building 20. This structure, located at the\nintersection of Main and Vassar Streets in East Cambridge, and eventually demolished\nin 1998, was thrown together as a temporary shelter during World War II, meant to\nhouse the overflow from the school’s bustling Radiation Laboratory. As noted by a\n2012 \nNew Yorker\n article, the building was initially seen as a failure: “Ventilation was\npoor and hallways were dim. The walls were thin, the roof leaked, and the building\nwas broiling in the summer and freezing in the winter.”\nWhen the war ended, however, the influx of scientists to Cambridge continued.\nMIT needed space, so instead of immediately demolishing Building 20 as they had\npromised local officials (in exchange for lax permitting), they continued using it as\noverflow space. The result was that a mismatch of different departments—from\nnuclear science to linguistics to electronics—shared the low-slung building alongside\nmore esoteric tenants such as a machine shop and a piano repair facility. Because the\nbuilding was cheaply constructed, these groups felt free to rearrange space as needed.\nWalls and floors could be shifted and equipment bolted to the beams. In recounting the\nstory of Jerrold Zacharias’s work on the first atomic clock, the abovementioned \nNew\nYorker\n article points to the importance of his ability to remove two floors from his\nBuilding 20 lab so he could install the three-story cylinder needed for his\nexperimental apparatus.\nIn MIT lore, it’s generally believed that this haphazard \ncombination of different\ndisciplines, thrown together in a large reconfigurable building, led to chance\nencounters and a spirit of inventiveness that generated breakthroughs at a fast pace,\ninnovating topics as diverse as Chomsky grammars, Loran navigational radars, and\nvideo games, all within the same productive postwar decades. When the building was\nfinally demolished to make way for the $300 million Frank Gehry–designed Stata\nCenter (where I spent my time), its loss was mourned. In tribute to the “plywood\npalace” it replaced, the interior design of the Stata Center includes boards of\nunfinished plywood and exposed concrete with construction markings left intact.\nAround the same time that Building 20 was hastily constructed, a more systematic\npursuit of serendipitous creativity was under way two hundred miles to the southwest\nin Murray Hill, New Jersey. It was here that Bell Labs director Mervin Kelly guided\n\f\nthe construction of a new home for the lab that would purposefully encourage\ninteraction between its diverse mix of scientists and engineers. Kelly dismissed the\nstandard university-style approach of housing different departments in different\nbuildings, and instead connected the spaces into one contiguous structure joined by\nlong hallways—some so long that when you stood at one end it would appear to\nconverge to a vanishing point. As Bell Labs chronicler Jon Gertner notes about this\ndesign: “Traveling the hall’s length without encountering a number of acquaintances,\nproblems, diversions and ideas was almost impossible. A physicist on his way to\nlunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings.”\nThis strategy, mixed with Kelly’s aggressive recruitment of some of the world’s\nbest minds, yielded some of the most concentrated innovation in the history of modern\ncivilization. In the decades following the Second World War, the lab produced, among\nother achievements: the first solar cell, laser, communication satellite, cellular\ncommunication system, and fiber optic networking. At the same time, their theorists\nformulated both information theory and coding theory, their astronomers won the\nNobel Prize for empirically validating the Big Bang Theory, and perhaps most\nimportant of all, their physicists invented the transistor.\nThe theory of serendipitous creativity, in other words, seems well justified by the\nhistorical record. The transistor, we can argue with some confidence, probably\nrequired Bell Labs and its ability to put solid-state physicists, quantum theorists, and\nworld-class experimentalists in one building where they could serendipitously\nencounter one another and learn from their varied expertise. This was an invention\nunlikely to come from a lone scientist thinking deeply in the academic equivalent of\nCarl Jung’s stone tower.\nBut it’s here that we must embrace more nuance in understanding what \nreally\ngenerated innovation in sites such as Building 20 and Bell Labs. To do so, let’s return\nonce again to my own experience at MIT. When I arrived as a new PhD student in the\nfall of 2004, I was a member of the first incoming class to be housed in the new Stata\nCenter, which, as mentioned, replaced Building 20. Because the center was new,\nincoming students were given tours that touted its features. Frank Gehry, we learned,\narranged the \noffices around common spaces and introduced open stairwells between\nadjacent floors, all in an effort to support the type of serendipitous encounters that had\ndefined its predecessor. But what struck me at the time was a feature that hadn’t\noccurred to Gehry but had been recently added at the faculty’s insistence: special\ngaskets installed into the office doorjambs to improve soundproofing. The professors\nat MIT—some of the most innovative technologists in the world—wanted nothing to\ndo with an open-office-style workspace. They instead demanded the ability to close\n\f\nthemselves off.\nThis combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields\na \nhub-and-spoke\n architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and\nisolated deep thinking are supported. It’s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on\none extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from\ndistraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open\noffice, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to\nbuild on it.\n*\nIf we turn our attention back to Building 20 and Bell Labs, we see that this is the\narchitecture they deployed as \nwell. Neither building offered anything resembling a\nmodern open office plan. They were instead constructed using the standard layout of\nprivate offices connected to shared hallways. Their creative mojo had more to do with\nthe fact that these offices shared a small number of long connecting spaces—forcing\nresearchers to interact whenever they needed to travel from one location to another.\nThese mega-hallways, in other words, provided highly effective hubs.\nWe can, therefore, still dismiss the depth-destroying open office concept without\ndismissing the innovation-producing theory of serendipitous creativity. The key is to\nmaintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs\non a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you\nencounter.\nThis division of efforts, however, is not the full story, as even when one returns to\na spoke, solo work is still not necessarily the best strategy. Consider, for example, the\npreviously mentioned invention of the (point-contact) transistor at Bell Labs. This\nbreakthrough was supported by a large group of researchers, all with separate\nspecialties, who came together to form the \nsolid-state physics research group\n—a\nteam dedicated to inventing a smaller and more reliable alternative to the vacuum\ntube. This group’s collaborative conversations were necessary preconditions to the\ntransistor: a clear example of the usefulness of hub behavior.\nOnce the research group laid the intellectual groundwork for the component, the\ninnovation process shifted to a spoke. What makes this particular innovation process\nan interesting case, however, is that even when it shifted to a \nspoke it remained\ncollaborative. It was two researchers in particular—the experimentalist Walter\nBrattain and the quantum theorist John Bardeen—who over a period of one month in\n1947 made the series of breakthroughs that led to the first working solid-state\ntransistor.\nBrattain and Bardeen worked together during this period in a small lab, often side"

    "raw_text": "by side, pushing each other toward better and more effective designs. These efforts\nconsisted primarily of deep work—but a type of deep work we haven’t yet\nencountered. Brattain would concentrate intensely to engineer an experimental design\nthat could exploit Bardeen’s latest theoretical insight; then Bardeen would concentrate\nintensely to make sense of what Brattain’s latest experiments revealed, trying to\nexpand his theoretical framework to match the observations. This back-and-forth\nrepresents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that\nleverages what I call \nthe whiteboard effect\n. For some types of problems, working\nwith someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if\nyou were working alone. The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight\n—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can\nshort-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.\nWe can now step back and draw some practical conclusions about the role of\ncollaboration in deep work. The success of Building 20 and Bell Labs indicates that\nisolation is not required for productive deep work. Indeed, their example indicates\nthat for many types of work—especially when pursuing innovation—collaborative\ndeep work can yield \nbetter results. This strategy, therefore, asks that you consider this\noption in contemplating how best to integrate depth into your professional life. In\ndoing so, however, keep the following two guidelines in mind.\nFirst\n, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke\nmodel provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters\nfrom your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to\noptimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that\nimpedes both goals.\nSecond\n, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to\nleverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a\nproblem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward\nthe generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.\nWhen it comes to deep work, in other words, consider the use of collaboration\nwhen appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level. At the same time, don’t\nlionize this quest for interaction and positive randomness to the point where it crowds\nout the unbroken concentration ultimately required to wring something useful out of the\nswirl of ideas all around us.\nExecute Like a Business\n\f\nThe story has become lore in the world of business consulting. In the mid-1990s,\nHarvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen received a call from Andy\nGrove, the \nCEO and chairman of Intel. Grove had encountered Christensen’s research\non disruptive innovation and asked him to fly out to California to discuss the theory’s\nimplications for Intel. On arrival, Christensen walked through the basics of disruption:\nentrenched companies are often unexpectedly dethroned by start-ups that begin with\ncheap offerings at the low end of the market, but then, over time, improve their cheap\nproducts \njust enough\n to begin to steal high-end market share. Grove recognized that\nIntel faced this threat from low-end processors produced by upstart companies like\nAMD and Cyrix. Fueled by his newfound understanding of disruption, Grove devised\nthe strategy that led to the Celeron family of processors—a lower-performance\noffering that helped Intel successfully fight off the challenges from below.\nThere is, however, a lesser-known piece to this story. As Christensen recalls,\nGrove asked him during a break in this meeting, “How do I do this?” Christensen\nresponded with a discussion of business strategy, explaining how Grove could set up a\nnew business unit and so on. Grove cut him off with a gruff reply: “You are such a\nnaïve academic. I asked you \nhow\n to do it, and you told me \nwhat\n I should do. \nI know\nwhat I need to do. I just don’t know how to do it.\n”\nAs Christensen later explained, this division between \nwhat\n and \nhow\n is crucial but\nis overlooked in the professional world. It’s often straightforward to identify a\nstrategy needed to achieve a goal, but what trips up companies is figuring out how to\nexecute the strategy once identified. I came across this story in a foreword Christensen\nwrote for a book titled \nThe 4 Disciplines of Execution\n, which built on extensive\nconsulting case studies to describe four “disciplines” (abbreviated, 4DX) for helping\ncompanies successfully implement high-level strategies. What struck me as I read was\nthat this gap between \nwhat\n and \nhow\n was relevant to my personal quest to spend more\ntime working deeply. Just as Andy Grove had identified the importance of competing\nin the low-end processor market, I had identified the importance of prioritizing depth.\nWhat I needed was help figuring out how to execute this strategy.\nIntrigued by these parallels, I set out to adapt the 4DX framework to my personal\nwork habits and ended up surprised by how helpful they proved in driving me toward\neffective action on my goal of working deeply. These ideas may have been forged for\nthe world of big business, but the underlying concepts seem to apply anywhere that\nsomething important needs to get done against the backdrop of many competing\nobligations and distractions. With this in mind, I’ve summarized in the following\nsections the four disciplines of the 4DX framework, and for each I describe how I\nadapted it to the specific concerns of developing a deep work habit."

    "raw_text": "Discipline #1\n: Focus on the Wildly Important\nAs the authors of \nThe 4 Disciplines of Execution\n explain, “The more you try to do, the\nless you actually accomplish.” They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a\nsmall number of “wildly important goals.” This simplicity will help focus an\norganization’s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.\nFor an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify\na small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. The\ngeneral exhortation to “spend more time working deeply” doesn’t spark a lot of\nenthusiasm. To instead have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial\nprofessional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm. In a 2014 column\ntitled “The Art of Focus,” David Brooks endorsed this approach of letting ambitious\ngoals drive focused behavior, explaining: “If you want to win the war for attention,\ndon’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information\nsmorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the\nterrifying longing crowd out everything else.”\nFor example, when I first began experimenting with 4DX, I set the specific\nimportant goal of publishing five high-quality peer-reviewed papers in the upcoming\nacademic year. This goal was ambitious, as it was more papers than I had been\npublishing, and there were tangible rewards attached to it (tenure review was\nlooming). Combined, these two properties helped the goal stoke my motivation.\nDiscipline #2\n: Act on the Lead Measures\nOnce you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In\n4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: \nlag\n measures and \nlead\n measures.\nLag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. For example, if\nyour goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag\nmeasure is your \ncustomer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem\nwith lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you\nreceive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.”\nLead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive\nsuccess on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the\nnumber of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly\nincrease by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures\nwill likely eventually improve as well. In other words, lead measures turn your\n\f\nattention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will\nthen have a positive impact on your long-term goals.\nFor an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead\nmeasure: \ntime spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important\ngoal.\n Returning to my example, this insight had an important impact on how I directed\nmy academic research. I used to focus on lag measures, such as papers published per\nyear. These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because\nthere was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a\nnoticeable change to this long-term metric. When I shifted to tracking deep work\nhours, suddenly these measures became relevant to my day-to-day: Every hour extra of\ndeep work was immediately reflected in my tally.\nDiscipline #3\n: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard\n“People play differently when they’re keeping score,” the 4DX authors explain. They\nthen elaborate that when attempting to drive your team’s engagement toward your\norganization’s wildly important goal, it’s important that they have a public place to\nrecord and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition\nthat drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their\nattention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team notices\ntheir success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this\nperformance.\nIn the preceding discipline, I argued that for an individual focused on deep work,\nhours spent working deeply should be the lead measure. It follows, therefore, that the\nindividual’s scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays\nthe individual’s current deep work hour count.\nIn my early experiments with 4DX, I settled on a simple but effective solution for\nimplementing this scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and divided it into rows,\none for each week of the current semester. I then labeled each row with the dates of\nthe week and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn’t be\nignored). As each week progressed, I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that\nweek with a simple tally of tick marks in that week’s row. To maximize the motivation\ngenerated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in \nan\nacademic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark\ncorresponding to the hour where I finished the result.\n*\n This served two purposes.\nFirst, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accumulated deep work hours and\n\f\ntangible results. Second, it helped calibrate my expectations for how many hours of\ndeep work were needed per result. This reality (which was larger than I first\nassumed) helped spur me to squeeze more such hours into each week.\nDiscipline #4\n: Create a Cadence of Accountability\nThe 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead\nmeasures is to put in place “a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that\nowns a wildly important goal.” During these meetings, the team members must\nconfront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before\nthe next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the\nlast meeting. They note that this review can be condensed to only a few minutes, but it\nmust be regular for its effect to be felt. The authors argue that it’s this discipline where\n“execution really happens.”\nFor an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, there’s likely no\nteam to meet with, but this doesn’t exempt you from the need for regular\naccountability. In \nmultiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the\nhabit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule\n#4). During my experiments with 4DX, I used a weekly review to look over my\nscoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most\nimportant, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to\nadjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure—enabling significantly more\ndeep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.\nThe 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more\ndifficult than strategizing. After hundreds and hundreds of case studies, its inventors\nmanaged to isolate a few basic disciplines that seem to work particularly well in\nconquering this difficulty. It’s no surprise, therefore, that these same disciplines can\nhave a similar effect on your personal goal of cultivating a deep work habit.\nTo conclude, let’s return one last time to my own example. As I noted earlier,\nwhen I first embraced 4DX I adopted the goal of publishing five peer-reviewed\npapers in the 2013–2014 academic year. This was an ambitious goal given that I had\npublished only four papers the previous year (a feat I was proud of). Throughout this\n4DX experiment, the clarity of this goal, coupled with the simple but unavoidable\nfeedback of my lead measure scoreboard, pushed me to a level of depth I hadn’t\nbefore achieved. In retrospect, it was not so much the intensity of my deep work\nperiods that increased, but instead their regularity. Whereas I used to cluster my deep\n\f\nthinking near paper submission deadlines, the 4DX \nhabit kept my mind concentrated\nthroughout the full year. It ended up, I must admit, an exhausting year (especially given\nthat I was writing this book at the same time). But it also turned out to produce a\nconvincing endorsement for the 4DX framework: By the summer of 2014, I had \nnine\nfull papers accepted for publication, more than doubling what I had managed to\naccomplish in any preceding year.\nBe Lazy\nIn a 2012 article written for a \nNew York Times\n blog, the essayist and cartoonist Tim\nKreider provided a memorable self-description: “I am not busy. I am the laziest\nambitious person I know.” Kreider’s distaste for frenetic work, however, was put to\nthe test in the months leading up to the writing of his post. Here’s his description of the\nperiod: “I’ve insidiously started, because of professional obligations, to become\nbusy… every morning my in-box was full of e-mails asking me to do things I did not\nwant to do or presenting me with problems that I now had to solve.”\nHis solution? He fled to what he calls an “undisclosed location”: a place with no\nTV and no Internet (going online requires a bike ride to the local library), and where\nhe could remain nonresponsive to the pinprick onslaught of small obligations that seem\nharmless in isolation but aggregate to serious injury to his deep work habit. “I’ve\nremembered about buttercups, stink bugs and the stars,” Kreider says about his retreat\nfrom activity. “I read. And I’m finally getting some real writing done for the first time\nin months.”\nIt’s important for our purposes to recognize that Kreider is no Thoreau. He didn’t\nretreat from the world of busyness to underscore a complicated social critique. His\nmove to an undisclosed location was instead motivated by a surprising but practical\ninsight: \nIt made him better at his job.\n Here’s Kreider’s explanation:\nIdleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable\nto the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental\naffliction as disfiguring as rickets… it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting\nany work done.\nWhen Kreider talks of getting work done, of course, he’s not referencing shallow\ntasks. For the most part, the more time you can spend immersed in shallow work the\nmore of it that gets accomplished. As a writer and artist, however, Kreider is instead\nconcerned with deep work—the serious efforts that produce things the world values.\nThese efforts, he’s convinced, need the support of a mind regularly released to leisure.\n\f\nThis strategy argues that you should follow Kreider’s lead by injecting regular and\nsubstantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the\nidleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done. There are many ways to\naccomplish this goal. You could, for example, use Kreider’s approach of retreating\nfrom the world of shallow tasks altogether by hiding out in an “undisclosed location,”\nbut this isn’t practical for most people. Instead, I \nwant to suggest a more applicable\nbut still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your\nconsideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no\nmental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an\nupcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then\nextend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free to encounter\nKreider’s buttercups, stink bugs, and stars.\nBefore describing some tactics that support this strategy, I want to first explore\nwhy\n a shutdown will be profitable to your ability to produce valuable output. We\nhave, of course, Tim Kreider’s personal endorsement, but it’s worth taking the time to\nalso understand the science behind the value of downtime. A closer examination of\nthis literature reveals the following three possible explanations for this value.\nReason #1\n: Downtime Aids Insights\nConsider the following excerpt from a 2006 paper that appeared in the journal\nScience\n:\nThe scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious\ndeliberation in decision making for hundreds of years… The question\naddressed here is whether this view is justified. We hypothesize that it is not.\nLurking in this bland statement is a bold claim. The authors of this study, led by the\nDutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left\nto your unconscious mind to untangle. In other words, to actively try to work through\nthese decisions will lead to a \nworse\n outcome than loading up the relevant information\nand then moving on to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your\nmind mull things over.\nDijksterhuis’s team isolated this effect by giving subjects the information needed\nfor a complex decision regarding a car purchase. Half the subjects were told to think\nthrough the information and then make the best decision. The other half were distracted\nby easy puzzles after they read the information, and were then put on the spot to make a\ndecision without having had time to consciously deliberate. The distracted group\n\f\nended up performing better.\nObservations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his\ncollaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to\nunderstand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision\nmaking. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the\napplication of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you\nneed to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise\narithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve\nlarge amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting,\nconstraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT\nhypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more\nneuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and\nsift through more potential solutions than your \nconscious centers of thinking. Your\nconscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can\nrun carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems,\nwhereas your unconscious mind is like Google’s vast data centers, in which statistical\nalgorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising\nuseful solutions to difficult questions.\nThe implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time\nto rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most\ncomplex professional challenges. A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily\nreducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but is instead\ndiversifying the type of work you deploy.\nReason #2\n: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work\nDeeply\nA frequently cited 2008 paper appearing in the journal \nPsychological Science\ndescribes a simple experiment. Subjects were split into two groups. One group was\nasked to take a walk on a wooded path in an arboretum near the Ann Arbor, Michigan,\ncampus where the study was conducted. The other group was sent on a walk through\nthe bustling center of the city. Both groups were then given a concentration-sapping\ntask called backward digit-span. The core finding of the study is that the nature group\nperformed up to 20 percent better on the task. The nature advantage still held the next\nweek when the researchers brought back the same subjects and switched the locations:\nIt wasn’t the people \nwho determined performance, but whether or not they got a\nchance to prepare by walking through the woods.\n\f\nThis study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration theory\n(ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to\nconcentrate. This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s by the University of\nMichigan psychologists Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan (the latter of which co-\nauthored the 2008 study discussed here, along with Marc Berman and John Jonides),\nis based on the concept of attention fatigue. To concentrate requires what ART calls\ndirected attention\n. This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to\nconcentrate. (For our purposes, we can think of this resource as the same thing as\nBaumeister’s limited willpower reserves we discussed in the introduction to this\nrule.\n*\n) The 2008 study argues that walking on busy city streets requires you to use\ndirected attention, as you must navigate complicated tasks like figuring out when to\ncross a street to not get run over, or when to maneuver around the slow group of\ntourists blocking the sidewalk. After just fifty minutes of this focused navigation, the\nsubject’s store of directed attention was low.\nWalking through nature, by contrast, exposes you to what lead author Marc Berman\ncalls “inherently fascinating stimuli,” using sunsets as an example. These stimuli\n“invoke \nattention modestly, allowing focused-attention mechanisms a chance to\nreplenish.” Put another way, when walking through nature, you’re freed from having to\ndirect your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street\ncrossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently\noccupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows your\ndirected attention resources time to replenish. After fifty minutes of such\nreplenishment, the subjects enjoyed a boost in their concentration.\n(You might, of course, argue that perhaps being outside watching a sunset puts\npeople in a good mood, and being in a good mood is what really helps performance on\nthese tasks. But in a sadistic twist, the researchers debunked that hypothesis by\nrepeating the experiment in the harsh Ann Arbor winter. Walking outside in brutal cold\nconditions didn’t put the subjects in a good mood, but they still ended up doing better\non concentration tasks.)\nWhat’s important to our purpose is observing that the implications of ART expand\nbeyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you\ncan restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. Walking\nin nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing\nactivities so long as they provide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom\nfrom directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to\nmusic while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run—the types\nof activities that will fill your time in the evening \nif you enforce a work shutdown—\n\f\nplay the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature.\nOn the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-\nmail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline,\nyou’re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for\nrestoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they\nprevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention\nrestoration can occur. Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next\nday can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge\nfor the next day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of\nyour evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up\ngetting \nless\n done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.\nReason #3\n: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not\nThat Important\nThe final argument for maintaining a clear endpoint to your workday requires us to\nreturn briefly to Anders Ericsson, the inventor of deliberate practice theory. As you\nmight recall from Part 1, deliberate practice is the systematic stretching of your ability\nfor a given skill. It is the activity required to get better at something. Deep work and\ndeliberate practice, as I’ve argued, overlap substantially. For our purposes here we\ncan use deliberate practice as a general-purpose stand-in for cognitively demanding\nefforts.\nIn Ericsson’s seminal 1993 paper on the topic, titled \n“The Role of Deliberate\nPractice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” he dedicates a section to\nreviewing what the research literature reveals about an individual’s capacity for\ncognitively demanding work. Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an\nhour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number\ncan expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more.\nOne of the studies cited, for example, catalogs the practice habits of a group of\nelite violin players training at Berlin’s Universität der Künste. This study found the\nelite players average around three and a half hours per day in a state of deliberate\npractice, usually separated into two distinct periods. The less accomplished players\nspent less time in a state of depth.\nThe implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day\nis limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of\nproductivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work\n\f\ncapacity during your workday. It follows, therefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the\npoint where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the\nnight, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your\ncareer; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks\n(executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words,\nyou’re not missing out on much of importance.\nThe three reasons just described support the general strategy of maintaining a strict\nendpoint to your workday. Let’s conclude by filling in some details concerning\nimplementation.\nTo succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your\nworkday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional\nconcerns into your field of attention. This includes, crucially, checking e-mail, as well\nas browsing work-related websites. In both cases, even a brief intrusion of work can\ngenerate a self-reinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages\ndescribed earlier for a long time to follow (most people are familiar, for example,\nwith the experience of glancing at an alarming e-mail on a Saturday morning and then\nhaving its implications haunt your thoughts for the rest of the weekend).\nAnother key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your\ncommitment to shutting down with a strict \nshutdown ritual\n that you use at the end of\nthe workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual\nshould ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that\nfor each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its\ncompletion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is\nright. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one\nafter another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion\n(to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy, but\nit provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for\nthe rest of the day.\nTo make this suggestion more concrete, let me walk through the steps of my own\nshutdown ritual (which I first \ndeveloped around the time I was writing my doctoral\ndissertation, and have deployed, in one form or another, ever since). The first thing I\ndo is take a final look at my e-mail inbox to ensure that there’s nothing requiring an\nurgent response before the day ends. The next thing I do is transfer any new tasks that\nare on my mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day into my official task lists. (I\nuse Google Docs for storing my task lists, as I like the ability to access them from any\ncomputer—but the technology here isn’t really relevant.) Once I have these task lists\n\f\nopen, I quickly skim \nevery\n task in every list, and then look at the next few days on my\ncalendar. These two actions ensure that there’s nothing urgent I’m forgetting or any\nimportant deadlines or appointments sneaking up on me. I have, at this point, reviewed\neverything that’s on my professional plate. To end the ritual, I use this information to\nmake a rough plan for the next day. Once the plan is created, I say, “Shutdown\ncomplete,” and my work thoughts are done for the day.\nThe concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good\nreason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental\nwork of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the\nability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop\nwhatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until\ntomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as\nthe many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s\nexperiments, \nkeep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that\nthey’ll often win).\nAt first, this challenge might seem unresolvable. As any busy knowledge worker\ncan attest, there are \nalways\n tasks left incomplete. The idea that you can ever reach a\npoint where all your obligations are handled is a fantasy. Fortunately, we don’t need\nto \ncomplete\n a task to get it off our minds. Riding to our rescue in this matter is our\nfriend from earlier in the rule, the psychologist Roy Baumeister, who wrote a paper\nwith E.J. Masicampo playfully titled “Consider It Done!” In this study, the two\nresearchers began by replicating the Zeigarnik effect in their subjects (in this case, the\nresearchers assigned a task and then cruelly engineered interruptions), but then found\nthat they could significantly reduce the effect’s impact by asking the subjects, soon\nafter the interruption, to make a plan for how they would \nlater\n complete the\nincomplete task. To quote the paper: “Committing to a specific plan for a goal may\ntherefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive\nresources for other pursuits.”\nThe shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the Zeigarnik\neffect. While it doesn’t force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in\nyour task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force you to capture every task in a\ncommon list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day. This\nritual ensures that no task will be forgotten: Each will be reviewed daily and tackled\nwhen the time is appropriate. Your mind, in \nother words, is released from its duty to\nkeep track of these obligations at every moment—your shutdown ritual has taken over\nthat responsibility.\n\f\nShutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes\nto the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for\nreaping the rewards of systematic idleness summarized previously. From my\nexperience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks—that is,\nuntil your mind trusts your ritual enough to actually begin to release work-related\nthoughts in the evening. But once it does stick, the ritual will become a permanent\nfixture in your life—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you with a sense of\nunease.\nDecades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point\ntoward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your\ndeep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done. Your average e-\nmail response time might suffer some, but you’ll more than make up for this with the\nsheer volume of truly important work produced during the day by your refreshed\nability to dive deeper than your exhausted peers."

    "raw_text": "Rule #2\nEmbrace Boredom\nTo better understand how one masters the art of deep work, I suggest visiting the\nKnesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring Valley, New York, at six a.m. on a weekday\nmorning. If you do, you’ll likely find at least twenty cars in the parking lot. Inside,\nyou’ll encounter a couple dozen members of the congregation working over texts—\nsome might be reading silently, mouthing the words of an ancient language, while\nothers are paired together debating. At one end of the room a rabbi will be leading a\nlarger group in a discussion. This early morning gathering in Spring Valley represents\njust a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of orthodox Jews who will wake up\nearly that morning, as they do every weekday morning, to practice a central tenet of\ntheir faith: to spend time every day studying the complex written traditions of Rabbinic\nJudaism.\nI was introduced to this world by Adam Marlin, a member of the Knesses Yisroel\ncongregation and one of the regulars at its morning study group. As Marlin explained\nto me, his goal with this practice is to decipher one Talmud page each day (though he\nsometimes fails to make it even this \nfar), often working with a \nchevruta\n (study\npartner) to push his understanding closer to his cognitive limit.\nWhat interests me about Marlin is not his knowledge of ancient texts, but instead\nthe type of effort required to gain this knowledge. When I interviewed him, he\nemphasized the mental intensity of his morning ritual. “It’s an extreme and serious\ndiscipline, consisting mostly of the ‘deep work’ stuff [you write about],” he explained.\n“I run a growing business, but this is often the hardest brain strain I do.” This strain is\nnot unique to Marlin but is instead ingrained in the practice—as his rabbi once\nexplained to him: “You cannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation\nunless you have stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.”\nUnlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin came late to his faith, not starting his rigorous\nTalmud training until his twenties. This bit of trivia proves useful to our purposes\nbecause it allows Marlin a clear before-and-after comparison concerning the impact\nof these mental calisthenics—and the result surprised him. Though Marlin was\n\f\nexceptionally well educated when he began the practice—he holds \nthree different\n Ivy\nLeague degrees—he soon met fellow adherents who had only ever attended small\nreligious schools but could still “dance intellectual circles” around him. “A number of\nthese people are highly successful [professionally],” he explained to me, “but it\nwasn’t some fancy school that pushed their intellect higher; it became clear it was\ninstead their daily study that started as early as the fifth grade.”\nAfter a while, Marlin began to notice positive changes in his own ability to think\ndeeply. “I’ve recently been making \nmore highly creative insights in my business life,”\nhe told me. “I’m convinced it’s related to this daily mental practice. This consistent\nstrain has built my mental muscle over years and years. This was not the goal when I\nstarted, but it is the effect.”\nAdam Marlin’s experience underscores an important reality about deep work: The\nability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. This idea might sound\nobvious once it’s pointed out, but it represents a departure from how most people\nunderstand such matters. In my experience, it’s common to treat undistracted\nconcentration as a \nhabit\n like flossing—something that you know how to do and know\nis good for you, but that you’ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-\nset is appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from distracted\nto focused overnight if you can simply muster enough motivation. But this\nunderstanding ignores the difficulty of focus and the hours of practice necessary to\nstrengthen your “mental muscle.” The creative insights that Adam Marlin now\nexperiences in his professional life, in other words, have little to do with a onetime\ndecision to think deeper, and much to do with a commitment to training this ability\nearly every morning.\nThere is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen your focus\nwill struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on\ndistraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside\nof their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration\nif you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.\nWe can find evidence for this claim in the research of Clifford Nass, the late\nStanford communications professor who was well known for his study of behavior in\nthe digital age. Among other insights, Nass’s research revealed that constant attention\nswitching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain. Here’s Nass summarizing\nthese findings in a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira Flatow:\nSo we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask\nall the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable.\n\f\nPeople who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t\nmanage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted. They initiate\nmuch larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand…\nthey’re pretty much mental wrecks.\nAt this point Flatow asks Nass whether the chronically distracted recognize this\nrewiring of their brain:\nThe people we talk with continually said, “look, when I really have to\nconcentrate, I turn off everything and I am laser-focused.”\n And unfortunately,\nthey’ve developed habits of mind that make it impossible for them to be laser-\nfocused. \nThey’re suckers for irrelevancy. They just can’t keep on task.\n[emphasis mine]\nOnce your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass\ndiscovered, it’s hard to shake the addiction \neven when you \nwant\n to concentrate. To put\nthis more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having\nto wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is\nrelieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been\nrewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready\nfor deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.\nRule #1 taught you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with\nroutines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your\nconcentration ability. Rule #2 will help you significantly improve this limit. The\nstrategies that follow are motivated by the key idea that getting the most out of your\ndeep work habit requires training, and as clarified previously, this training must\naddress two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely \nand\n overcoming\nyour desire for distraction. These strategies cover a variety of approaches, from\nquarantining distraction to mastering a special form of meditation, that combine to\nprovide a practical road map for your journey from a mind wrecked by constant\ndistraction and unfamiliar with concentration, to an instrument that truly does deliver\nlaser-like focus.\nDon’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.\nMany assume that they can switch between a state of distraction and one of\nconcentration as needed, but as I just \nargued, this assumption is optimistic: Once\nyou’re wired for distraction, you crave it. Motivated by this reality, this strategy is\ndesigned to help you rewire your brain to a configuration better suited to staying on\n\f\ntask.\nBefore diving into the details, let’s start by considering a popular suggestion for\ndistraction addiction that doesn’t quite solve our problem: the Internet Sabbath\n(sometimes called a digital detox). In its basic form, this ritual asks you to put aside\nregular time—typically, one day a week—where you refrain from network technology.\nIn the same way that the Sabbath in the Hebrew Bible induces a period of quiet and\nreflection well suited to appreciate God and his works, the Internet Sabbath is meant\nto remind you of what you miss when you are glued to a screen.\nIt’s unclear who first introduced the Internet Sabbath concept, but credit for\npopularizing the idea often goes to the journalist William Powers, who promoted the\npractice in his 2010 reflection on technology and human happiness, \nHamlet’s\nBlackBerry\n. As Powers later summarizes in an interview: “Do what Thoreau did,\nwhich is learn to have a little disconnectedness within the connected world—don’t run\naway.”\nA lot of advice for the problem of distraction follows this general template of\nfinding occasional time to get away from the clatter. Some put aside one or two\nmonths a year to escape these tethers, others follow Powers’s one-day-a-week advice,\nwhile others put aside an hour or two every day for the same purpose. All forms of\nthis advice provide some benefit, but once we see the distraction problem in terms of\nbrain wiring, it becomes clear that an Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a\ndistracted brain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to lose weight,\nas the majority of your time is still spent gorging. Similarly, if you spend just one day\na week resisting distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your brain’s craving for these\nstimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in to it.\nI propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the\noccasional break \nfrom distraction\n so you can focus, you should instead schedule the\noccasional break \nfrom focus\n to give in to distraction. To make this suggestion more\nconcrete, let’s make the simplifying assumption that Internet use is synonymous with\nseeking distracting stimuli. (You can, of course, use the Internet in a way that’s\nfocused and deep, but for a distraction addict, this is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s\nconsider working in the absence of the Internet to be synonymous with more focused\nwork. (You can, of course, find ways to be distracted without a network connection,\nbut these tend to be easier to resist.)\nWith these rough categorizations established, the strategy works as follows:\nSchedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside\nthese times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad,\n\f\nrecord the \nnext\n time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time,\nabsolutely no network connectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.\nThe idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by\nitself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant \nswitching\n from\nlow-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest\nhint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an\nabsence of novelty. This constant switching can be understood analogously as\nweakening the mental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for\nyour attention. By segregating Internet use (and therefore segregating distractions)\nyou’re minimizing the number of times you give in to distraction, and by doing so you\nlet these attention-selecting muscles strengthen.\nFor example, if you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the\ncurrent moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next\nthirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day\nof scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of similar mental training.\nWhile the basic idea behind this strategy is straightforward, putting it into practice\ncan be tricky. To help you succeed, here are three important points to consider.\nPoint #1\n: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet\nuse and/or prompt e-mail replies.\nIf you’re required to spend hours every day online or answer e-mails quickly, that’s\nfine: This simply means that your \nInternet blocks\n will be more numerous than those of\nsomeone whose job requires less connectivity. The total number or duration of your\nInternet blocks doesn’t matter nearly as much as making sure that the integrity of your\noffline blocks\n remains intact.\nImagine, for example, that over a two-hour period between meetings, you must\nschedule an e-mail check every fifteen minutes. Further imagine that these checks\nrequire, on average, five minutes. It’s sufficient, therefore, to schedule an Internet\nblock every fifteen minutes through this two-hour stretch, with the rest of the time\ndedicated to offline blocks. In this example, you’ll end up spending around ninety\nminutes out of this two-hour period in a state where you’re offline and actively\nresisting distraction. This works out to be a large amount of concentration training\nthat’s achieved without requiring you to sacrifice too much connectivity.\n\f\nPoint #2\n: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you\nmust keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet\nuse.\nThis objective is easy to state in principle but quickly becomes tricky in the messy\nreality of the standard workday. An inevitable issue you’ll face when executing this\nstrategy is realizing early on in an offline block that there’s some crucial piece of\ninformation online that you need to retrieve to continue making progress on your\ncurrent task. If your next Internet block doesn’t start for a while, you might end up\nstuck. The temptation in this situation is to quickly give in, look up the information,\nthen return to your offline block. \nYou must resist this temptation!\n The Internet is\nseductive: You may think you’re just retrieving a single key e-mail from your inbox,\nbut you’ll find it hard to not glance at the other “urgent” messages that have recently\narrived. It doesn’t take many of \nthese exceptions before your mind begins to treat the\nbarrier between Internet and offline blocks as permeable—diminishing the benefits of\nthis strategy.\nIt’s crucial in this situation, therefore, that you don’t immediately abandon an\noffline block, even when stuck. If it’s possible, switch to another offline activity for\nthe remainder of the current block (or perhaps even fill in this time relaxing). If this is\ninfeasible—perhaps you need to get the current offline activity done promptly—then\nthe correct response is to \nchange\n your schedule so that your next Internet block begins\nsooner. The key in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet\nblock to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the\ncurrent moment and the next time you can go online. This gap is minor, so it won’t\nexcessively impede your progress, but from a behavioralist perspective, it’s\nsubstantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward\nof actually doing so.\nPoint #3\n: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further\nimprove your concentration training.\nIf you find yourself glued to a smartphone or laptop throughout your evenings and\nweekends, then it’s likely that your behavior outside of work is undoing many of your\nattempts during the workday to rewire your brain (which makes little distinction\nbetween the two settings). In this case, I would suggest that you maintain the strategy\nof scheduling Internet use even after the workday is over."

    "raw_text": "To simplify matters, when scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-\nsensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on\nwhere you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive information retrieval (e.g.,\nlooking up the location of the restaurant on your phone). Outside of these pragmatic\nexceptions, however, when in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and\nrefrain from Internet usage. As in the workplace variation of this strategy, if the\nInternet plays a large and important role in your evening entertainment, that’s fine:\nSchedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the\ntotal amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give\nyourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to \nresist\n switching to these\ndistractions at the slightest hint of boredom.\nOne place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when\nyou’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It’s crucial in these\nsituations that if you’re in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary\nboredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait\nand be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective\nof concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.\nTo summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be\ncomfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate\ndistracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such\nbehaviors to hijack your attention. The simple \nstrategy proposed here of scheduling\nInternet blocks goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy.\nWork Like Teddy Roosevelt\nIf you attended Harvard College during the 1876–1877 school year, you would’ve\nlikely noticed a wiry, mutton-chopped, brash, and impossibly energetic freshman\nnamed Theodore Roosevelt. If you then proceeded to befriend this young man, you\nwould’ve soon noticed a paradox.\nOn the one hand, his attention might appear to be hopelessly scattered, spread over\nwhat one classmate called an “amazing array of interests”—a list that biographer\nEdmund Morris catalogs to contain boxing, wrestling, body building, dance lessons,\npoetry readings, and the continuation of a lifelong obsession with naturalism\n(Roosevelt’s landlord on Winthrop Street was not pleased with her young tenant’s\ntendency to dissect and stuff specimens in his rented room). This latter interest\ndeveloped to the point that Roosevelt published his first book, \nThe Summer Birds of"

    "raw_text": "the Adirondacks\n, in the summer after his freshman year. It was well received in the\nBulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club\n—a publication, needless to say, which\ntakes bird books quite seriously—and was good enough to lead Morris to assess\nRoosevelt, at this young age, to be “one of the most knowledgeable young naturalists\nin the United States.”\nTo support this extracurricular exuberance Roosevelt had to severely restrict the\ntime left available for what should have been his primary focus: his studies at\nHarvard. Morris \nused Roosevelt’s diary and letters from this period to estimate that\nthe future president was spending no more than a quarter of the typical day studying.\nOne might expect therefore that Roosevelt’s grades would crater. But they didn’t. He\nwasn’t the top student in his class, but he certainly didn’t struggle either: In his\nfreshman year he earned honor grades in five out of his seven courses. The explanation\nfor this Roosevelt paradox turns out to be his unique approach to tackling this\nschoolwork. Roosevelt would begin his scheduling by considering the eight hours\nfrom eight thirty a.m. to four thirty p.m. He would then remove the time spent in\nrecitation and classes, his athletic training (which was once a day), and lunch. The\nfragments that remained were then considered time dedicated exclusively to studying.\nAs noted, these fragments didn’t usually add up to a large number of total hours, but he\nwould get the most out of them by working \nonly\n on schoolwork during these periods,\nand doing so with a blistering \nintensity\n. “The amount of time he spent at his desk was\ncomparatively small,” explained Morris, “but his concentration was so intense, and\nhis reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off [from schoolwork] than most.”\nThis strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your\nown workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep\nwork to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally\nput aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that\ndrastically reduces\n \nthis time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline—for\nexample, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect\nit. If this isn’t possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by\nsetting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid\nseeing it as you work.\nAt this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in\ntime: \nworking with great intensity\n—no e-mail breaks, no daydreaming, no Facebook\nbrowsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack\nthe task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of\nconcentration.\n\f\nTry this experiment no more than once a week at first—giving your brain practice\nwith intensity, but also giving it (and your stress levels) time to rest in between. Once\nyou feel confident in your ability to trade concentration for completion time, increase\nthe frequency of these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, however, to always keep your\nself-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility. You should be able to\nconsistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but to do so should require teeth-\ngritting concentration.\nThe main motivation for this strategy is straightforward. Deep work requires levels\nof concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable.\nRoosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the\nlevel you can regularly achieve—providing, in some sense, interval training for the\nattention centers of your brain. An additional benefit is that these dashes are\nincompatible with distraction (there’s no way you can give \nin to distraction and still\nmake your deadlines). Therefore, every completed dash provides a session in which\nyou’re potentially bored, and really want to seek more novel stimuli—but you resist.\nAs argued in the previous strategy, the more you practice resisting such urges, the\neasier such resistance becomes.\nAfter a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of what it means\nto focus will likely be transformed as you reach levels of intensity stronger than\nanything you’ve experienced before. And if you’re anything like a young Roosevelt,\nyou can then repurpose the extra free time it generates toward the finer pleasures in\nlife, like trying to impress the always-discerning members of the Nuttall\nOrnithological Club.\nMeditate Productively\nDuring the two years I spent as a postdoctoral associate at MIT, my wife and I lived in\na small but charming apartment on Pinckney Street, in historic Beacon Hill. Though I\nlived in Boston and worked in Cambridge, the two locations were close—only a mile\napart, sitting on opposite banks of the Charles River. Intent on staying fit, even during\nthe long and dark New England winter, I decided to take advantage of this proximity\nby traveling between home and work, to the greatest extent possible, on foot.\nMy routine had me walk to campus in the morning, crossing the Longfellow Bridge\nin all weather (the city, it turns out to my dismay, is often slow to shovel the\npedestrian \npath after snowstorms). Around lunch, I would change into running gear and\nrun back home on a longer path that followed the banks of the Charles, crossing at the\n\f\nMassachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a quick lunch and shower at home, I would\ntypically take the subway across the river on the way back to campus (saving, perhaps,\na third of a mile on the trek), and then walk home when the workday was done. In\nother words, I spent \na lot\n of time on my feet during this period. It was this reality that\nled me to develop the practice that I’ll now suggest you adopt in your own deep work\ntraining: \nproductive meditation\n.\nThe goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied\nphysically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your\nattention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your\nprofession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress\non a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation,\nyou must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders\nor stalls.\nI used to practice productive meditation in at least one of my daily cross-river\ntreks while living in Boston, and as I improved, so did my results. I ended up, for\nexample, working out the chapter outlines for a significant portion of my last book\nwhile on foot, and made progress on many knotty technical problems in my academic\nresearch.\nI suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own life. You\ndon’t necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal should be to\nparticipate in \nat least two or three such sessions in a typical week. Fortunately, finding\ntime for this strategy is easy, as it takes advantage of periods that would otherwise be\nwasted (such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually\nincrease your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work. In\nfact, you might even consider scheduling a walk during your workday specifically for\nthe purpose of applying productive meditation to your most pressing problem at the\nmoment.\nI’m not, however, suggesting this practice for its productivity benefits (though\nthey’re nice). I’m instead interested in its ability to rapidly improve your ability to\nthink deeply. In my experience, productive meditation builds on both of the key ideas\nintroduced at the beginning of this rule. By forcing you to resist distraction and return\nyour attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your\ndistraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper\non a single problem, it sharpens your concentration.\nTo succeed with productive meditation, it’s important to recognize that, like any\nform of meditation, it requires practice to do well. When I first attempted this strategy,\n\f\nback in the early weeks of my postdoc, I found myself hopelessly distracted—ending\nlong stretches of “thinking” with little new to show for my efforts. It took me a dozen\nor so sessions before I began to experience real results. You should expect something\nsimilar, so patience will be necessary. To help accelerate this ramp-up process,\nhowever, I have two specific suggestions to offer.\nSuggestion #1\n: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping\nAs a novice, when you begin a productive meditation session, your mind’s first act of\nrebellion will be to offer unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts. My mind,\nfor example, was often successful at derailing my attention by beginning to compose\nan e-mail that I knew I needed to write. Objectively speaking, this train of thought\nsounds exceedingly dull, but in the moment it can become impossibly tantalizing.\nWhen you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind\nyourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.\nDistraction of this type, in many ways, is the obvious enemy to defeat in\ndeveloping a productive meditation habit. A subtler, but equally effective adversary,\nis looping. When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will\nattempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might\nattempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by\ninstead looping over and over again on what you already know about it. For example,\nwhen working on a proof, my mind has a tendency to rehash simple preliminary\nresults, again and again, to avoid the harder work of building on these results toward\nthe needed solution. You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly subvert\nan entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark to yourself that\nyou seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step.\nSuggestion #2\n: Structure Your Deep Thinking\n“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in reality\nit’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and\ntime to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious. In my experience, it\nhelps to have some structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a\ncareful review of the relevant \nvariables\n for solving the problem and then storing these\nvalues in your working memory. For example, if you’re working on the outline for a\nbook chapter, the relevant variables might be the main points you want to make in the\nchapter. If you’re instead trying to solve a mathematics proof, these variables might be\n\f\nactual variables, or assumptions, or lemmas. Once the relevant variables are\nidentified, define the specific \nnext-step question\n you need to answer using these\nvariables. In the book chapter example, this next-step question might be, “How am I\ngoing to effectively open this chapter?,” and for a proof it might be, “What can go\nwrong if I don’t assume this property holds?” With the relevant variables stored and\nthe next-step question identified, you now have a specific target for your attention.\nAssuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this\nstructured approach to deep thinking is to \nconsolidate\n your gains by reviewing clearly\nthe answer you identified. At this point, you can push yourself to the next level of\ndepth by starting the process over. This cycle of reviewing and storing variables,\nidentifying and tackling the next-step question, then consolidating your gains is like \nan\nintense workout routine for your concentration ability. It will help you get more out of\nyour productive meditation sessions and accelerate the pace at which you improve\nyour ability to go deep.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nGiven just five minutes, Daniel Kilov can memorize any of the following: a shuffled\ndeck of cards, a string of one hundred random digits, or 115 abstract shapes (this last\nfeat establishing an Australian national record). It shouldn’t be surprising, therefore,\nthat Kilov recently won back-to-back silver medals in the Australian memory\nchampionships. What \nis\n perhaps surprising, given Kilov’s history, is that he ended up\na mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional memory,” Kilov told me. Indeed, during high\nschool he considered himself forgetful and disorganized. He also struggled\nacademically and was eventually diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. It was\nafter a chance encounter with Tansel Ali, one of the country’s most successful and\nvisible memory champions, that Kilov began to seriously train his memory. By the\ntime he earned his college degree he had won his first national competition medal.\nThis transformation into a world-class mental athlete was rapid, but not\nunprecedented. In 2006, the American science writer Joshua Foer won the USA\nMemory Championship after only a year of (intense) training—a journey \nhe chronicled\nin his 2011 bestseller, \nMoonwalking with Einstein\n. But what’s important to us about\nKilov’s story is what happened to his \nacademic\n performance during this period of\nintensive memory development. While training his brain, he went from a struggling\nstudent with attention deficit disorder to graduating from a demanding Australian"

    "raw_text": "university with first-class honors. He was soon accepted into the PhD program at one\nof the country’s top universities, where he currently studies under a renowned\nphilosopher.\nOne explanation for this transformation comes from research led by Henry\nRoediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of Washington in Saint Louis. In\n2014, Roediger and his collaborators sent a team, equipped with a battery of cognitive\ntests, to the Extreme Memory Tournament held in San Diego. They wanted to\nunderstand what differentiated these elite memorizers from the population at large.\n“We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of\nus is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at all \nbut of\nattention\n,” explained Roediger in a \nNew York Times\n blog post (emphasis mine). The\nability in question is called “attentional control,” and it measures the subjects’ ability\nto maintain their focus on essential information.\nA side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your\ngeneral ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task\ndemanding deep work. Daniel Kilov, we can therefore conjecture, didn’t become a\nstar student because of his award-winning \nmemory; it was instead his quest to improve\nthis memory that (incidentally) gave him the deep work edge needed to thrive\nacademically.\nThe strategy described here asks you to replicate a key piece of Kilov’s training,\nand therefore gain some of the same improvements to your concentration. In particular,\nit asks you to learn a standard but quite impressive skill in the repertoire of most\nmental athletes: the ability to memorize a shuffled deck of cards.\nThe technique for card memorization I’ll teach you comes from someone who knows\nquite a bit about this particular challenge: Ron White, a former USA Memory\nChampion and world record holder in card memorization.\n*\n The first thing White\nemphasizes is that professional memory athletes \nnever\n attempt rote memorization, that\nis, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head.\nThis approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands\nhow our brains work. We’re not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. We\nare, however, really good at remembering scenes. Think back to a recent memorable\nevent in your life: perhaps attending the opening session of a conference or meeting a\nfriend you haven’t seen in a while for a drink. Try to picture \nthe scene as clearly as\npossible. Most people in this scenario can conjure a surprisingly vivid recollection of\nthe event—even though you made no special effort to remember it at the time. If you\nsystematically counted the unique details in this memory, the total number of items\n\f\nwould likely be surprisingly numerous. Your mind, in other words, can quickly retain\nlots of detailed information—if it’s stored in the right way. Ron White’s card\nmemorization technique builds on this insight.\nTo prepare for this high-volume memorization task, White recommends that you\nbegin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in\nyour home. Perhaps you come in the door, walk through your front hallway, then turn\ninto the downstairs bathroom, walk out the door and enter the guest bedroom, walk\ninto the kitchen, and then head down the stairs into your basement. In each room,\nconjure a clear image of what you see.\nOnce you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in\nyour mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms. White recommends that\nthese items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next,\nestablish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example,\nin the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, then shoes on the floor by the mat,\nthen the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add\ntwo more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items you’ll later\nneed when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck.\nPractice this mental exercise of walking through the rooms, and looking at items in\neach room, in a set order. You should find that this type of memorization, because it’s\nbased on visual images of familiar places and things, will be much easier than the rote\nmemorizing you might remember from your school days.\nThe second step in preparing to memorize a deck of cards is to associate a\nmemorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards. To make this\nprocess easier, try to maintain some logical association between the card and the\ncorresponding image. White provides the example of associating Donald Trump with\nthe King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. Practice these associations until\nyou can pull a card randomly from the deck and immediately recall the associated\nimage. As before, the use of memorable visual images and associations will simplify\nthe task of forming these connections.\nThe two steps mentioned previously are \nadvance\n steps—things you do just once\nand can then leverage again and again in memorizing specific decks. Once these steps\nare done, you’re ready for the main event: memorizing as quickly as possible the order\nof fifty-two cards in a freshly shuffled deck. The method here is straightforward.\nBegin your mental walk-through of your house. As you encounter each item, look at the\nnext card from the shuffled deck, and imagine the corresponding memorable person or\nthing doing something memorable near that item. For example, if the first item and\n\f\nlocation is the mat in your front entry, and the first \ncard is the King of Diamonds, you\nmight picture Donald Trump wiping mud off of his expensive loafers on the entry mat\nin your front hallway.\nProceed carefully through the rooms, associating the proper mental images with\nobjects in the proper order. After you complete a room, you might want to walk\nthrough it a few times in a row to lock in the imagery. Once you’re done, you’re ready\nto hand the deck to a friend and amaze him by rattling off the cards in order without\npeeking. To do so, of course, simply requires that you perform the mental walk-\nthrough one more time, connecting each memorable person or thing to its\ncorresponding card as you turn your attention to it.\nIf you practice this technique, you’ll discover, like many mental athletes who came\nbefore you, that you can eventually internalize a whole deck in just minutes. More\nimportant than your ability to impress friends, of course, is the training such activities\nprovide your mind. Proceeding through the steps described earlier requires that you\nfocus your attention, again and again, on a clear target. Like a muscle responding to\nweights, this will strengthen your general ability to concentrate—allowing you to go\ndeeper with more ease.\nIt’s worth emphasizing, however, the obvious point that there’s nothing special\nabout card memorization. Any structured thought process that requires unwavering\nattention can have a similar effect—be it studying the Talmud, like Adam Marlin from\nRule #2’s introduction, or practicing \nproductive meditation, or trying to learn the\nguitar part of a song by ear (a past favorite of mine). If card memorization seems\nweird to you, in other words, then choose a replacement that makes similar cognitive\nrequirements. The key to this strategy is not the specifics, but instead the motivating\nidea that your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it.\n\f\nRule #3\nQuit Social Media\nIn 2013, author and digital media consultant Baratunde Thurston launched an\nexperiment. He decided to disconnect from his online life for twenty-five days: no\nFacebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a service that awarded him “Mayor of the\nYear” in 2011), not even e-mail. He needed the break. Thurston, who is described by\nfriends as “the most connected man in the world,” had by his own count participated in\nmore than fifty-nine thousand Gmail conversations and posted fifteen hundred times on\nhis Facebook wall in the year leading up to his experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried.\nDone. Toast,” he explained.\nWe know about Thurston’s experiment because he wrote about it in a cover article\nfor \nFast Company\n magazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” As Thurston reveals in the\narticle, it didn’t take long to adjust to a disconnected life. “By the end of that first\nweek, the quiet rhythm of my days seemed far less strange,” he said. “I was less\nstressed about not knowing new things; I felt that I still existed despite not having\nshared documentary evidence of said existence on the Internet.” Thurston struck up\nconversations with strangers. He \nenjoyed food without Instagramming the experience.\nHe bought a bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the thing when you’re not trying to\nsimultaneously check your Twitter”). “The end came too soon,” Thurston lamented.\nBut he had start-ups to run and books to market, so after the twenty-five days passed,\nhe reluctantly reactivated his online presence.\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment neatly summarizes two important points about our\nculture’s current relationship with social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and\nInstagram, and infotainment sites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed—two categories\nof online distraction that I will collectively call “network tools” in the pages ahead.\nThe first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and\nreduce our ability to concentrate. This reality no longer generates much debate; we all\nfeel it. This is a real problem for many different people, but the problem is especially\ndire if you’re attempting to improve your ability to work deeply. In the preceding rule,\nfor example, I described several strategies to help you sharpen your focus. These\nefforts will become significantly more difficult if you simultaneously behave like a"

    "raw_text": "pre-experiment Baratunde Thurston, allowing your life outside such training to remain\na distracted blur of apps and browser tabs. Willpower is limited, and therefore the\nmore enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain\nfocus on something important. To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take\nback control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal\nthem.\nBefore we begin fighting back against these distractions, however, we must better\nunderstand the battlefield. This brings me to the second important point summarized by\nBaratunde Thurston’s story: the impotence with which knowledge workers currently\ndiscuss this problem of network tools and attention. Overwhelmed by these tools’\ndemands on his time, Thurston felt that his only option was to (temporarily) quit the\nInternet altogether. This idea that a drastic \nInternet sabbatical\n*\n is the only alternative\nto the distraction generated by social media and infotainment has increasingly\npervaded our cultural conversation.\nThe problem with this binary response to this issue is that these two choices are\nmuch too crude to be useful. The notion that you would quit the Internet is, of course,\nan overstuffed straw man, infeasible for most (unless you’re a journalist writing a\npiece about distraction). No one is meant to actually follow Baratunde Thurston’s lead\n—and this reality provides justification for remaining with the only offered\nalternative: accepting our current distracted state as inevitable. For all the insight and\nclarity that Thurston gained during his Internet sabbatical, for example, it didn’t take\nhim long once the experiment ended to slide back into the fragmented state where he\nbegan. On the day when I \nfirst starting writing this chapter, which fell only six months\nafter Thurston’s article originally appeared in \nFast Company\n, the reformed connector\nhad already sent a dozen Tweets in the few hours since he woke up.\nThis rule attempts to break us out of this rut by proposing a third option: accepting\nthat these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be quite vital to\nyour success and happiness, \nbut at the same time\n also accepting that the threshold for\nallowing a site regular access to your time and attention (not to mention personal data)\nshould be much more stringent, and that most people should therefore be using many\nfewer such tools. I won’t ask you, in other words, to quit the Internet altogether like\nBaratunde Thurston did for twenty-five days back in 2013. But I will ask you to reject\nthe state of distracted hyperconnectedness that drove him to that drastic experiment in\nthe first place. There is a middle ground, and if you’re interested in developing a deep\nwork habit, you must fight to get there.\nOur first step toward finding this middle ground in network tool selection is to\n\f\nunderstand the current default decision process deployed by most Internet users. In the\nfall of 2013, I received insight into this process because of an article I wrote\nexplaining why I never joined Facebook. Though the piece was meant to be\nexplanatory and not accusatory, it nonetheless put many readers on the defensive,\nleading them to reply with justifications for \ntheir\n use of the service. Here are some\nexamples of these justifications:\n• \n“Entertainment was my initial draw to Facebook. I can see what my friends are\nup to and post funny photos, make quick comments.”\n• “[When] I first joined, [I didn’t know why]… By mere curiosity I joined a forum\nof short fiction stories. [Once] there I improved my writing and made very good\nfriends.”\n• “[I use] Facebook because a lot of people I knew in high school are on there.”\nHere’s what strikes me about these responses (which are representative of the\nlarge amount of feedback I received on this topic): They’re surprisingly minor. I don’t\ndoubt, for example, that the first commenter from this list finds some entertainment in\nusing Facebook, but I would also assume that this person wasn’t suffering some severe\ndeficit of entertainment options before he or she signed up for the service. I would\nfurther wager that this user would succeed in staving off boredom even if the service\nwere suddenly shut down. Facebook, at best, added one more (arguably quite\nmediocre) entertainment option to many that already existed.\nAnother commenter cited making friends in a writing forum. I don’t doubt the\nexistence of these friends, but we can assume that these friendships are lightweight—\ngiven that they’re based on sending short messages back and forth over a computer\nnetwork. There’s nothing wrong with such lightweight friendships, but they’re unlikely\nto be at the center of this user’s social life. Something similar can be said \nabout the\ncommenter who reconnected with high school friends: This is a nice diversion, but\nhardly something central to his or her sense of social connection or happiness.\nTo be clear, I’m not trying to denigrate the benefits identified previously—there’s\nnothing illusory or misguided about them. What I’m emphasizing, however, is that\nthese benefits are minor and somewhat random. (By contrast, if you’d instead asked\nsomeone to justify the use of, say, the World Wide Web more generally, or e-mail, the\narguments would become much more concrete and compelling.) To this observation,\nyou might reply that \nvalue is value\n: If you can find some extra benefit in using a\nservice like Facebook—even if it’s small—then why not use it? I call this way of\nthinking the \nany-benefit\n mind-set, as it identifies any possible benefit as sufficient\n\f\njustification for using a network tool. In more detail:\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:\n You’re justified in using a network tool if you\ncan identify \nany\n possible benefit to its use, or \nanything\n you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.\nThe problem with this approach, of course, is that it ignores all the negatives that\ncome along with the tools in question. These services are engineered to be addictive\n—robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your\nprofessional and personal goals (such as deep work). Eventually, if you use these\ntools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyperdistracted connectivity that\nplagued Baratunde Thurston and millions of others like him. It’s here that we\nencounter the true insidious nature of an any-benefit mind-set. The use of network\ntools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt to weigh pros against cons, but instead use\nany glimpse of some potential benefit as justification for unrestrained use of a tool,\nthen you’re unwittingly crippling your ability to succeed in the world of knowledge\nwork.\nThis conclusion, if considered objectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In the context\nof network tools, we’ve become comfortable with the any-benefit mind-set, but if we\ninstead zoom out and consider this mind-set in the broader context of skilled labor, it\nsuddenly seems a bizarre and ahistorical approach to choosing tools. In other words,\nonce you put aside the revolutionary rhetoric surrounding all things Internet—the\nsense, summarized in Part 1, that you’re either fully committed to “the revolution” or a\nLuddite curmudgeon—you’ll soon realize that network tools are not exceptional;\nthey’re tools, no different from a blacksmith’s hammer or an artist’s brush, used by\nskilled laborers to do their jobs better (and occasionally to enhance their leisure).\nThroughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to\ntheir encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them.\nThere’s no reason why knowledge workers cannot do the same when it comes to the\nInternet—the fact that the skilled labor here now involves digital bits doesn’t change\nthis reality.\nTo help understand what this more careful tool curation might look like, it makes\nsense to start by talking to someone who makes a living working with (nondigital)\ntools and \nrelies on a complex relationship with these tools to succeed. Fortunately for\nour purposes, I found just such an individual in a lanky English major turned\nsuccessful sustainable farmer, named (almost too aptly), Forrest Pritchard.\nForrest Pritchard runs Smith Meadows, a family farm located an hour west of D.C.—\none of many farms clustered in the valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Soon after\ntaking control of the land from his parents, as I learned, Pritchard moved the operation\n\f\naway from traditional monoculture crops and toward the then novel concept of grass-\nfinished meat. The farm bypasses wholesaling—you cannot find Smith Meadows\nsteaks in Whole Foods—to sell direct to consumers at the bustling farmers’ markets in\nthe Washington, D.C., metro area. By all accounts, the farm is thriving in an industry\nthat rarely rewards small operations.\nI first encountered Pritchard at our local farmers’ market in Takoma Park,\nMaryland, where the Smith Meadows stand does good business. To see Pritchard,\nusually standing a foot taller than most of his suburbanite customers, wearing the\nobligatory faded flannel of the farmer, is to see a craftsman confident in his trade. I\nintroduced myself to him because farming is a skill dependent on the careful\nmanagement of tools, and I wanted to understand how a craftsman in a nondigital field\napproaches this crucial task.\n“Haymaking is a good example,” he told me, not long into one of our conversations\non the topic. “It’s a subject where I can give you the basic idea without having to gloss\nover the underlying economics.”\nWhen Pritchard took over Smith Meadows, he explained, the farm made its own\nhay to use as animal feed during the winter months when grazing is impossible.\nHaymaking is done with a piece of equipment called a hay baler: a device you pull\nbehind a tractor that compresses and binds dried grass into bales. If you raise animals\non the East Coast there’s an obvious reason to own and operate a hay baler: Your\nanimals need hay. Why spend money to “buy in” feed when you have perfectly good\ngrass growing for free right in your own soil? If a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit\napproach used by knowledge workers, therefore, he would definitely buy a hay baler.\nBut as Pritchard explained to me (after preemptively apologizing for a moment of\nsnark), if a farmer actually adopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d be counting the\ndays until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, like most\npractitioners of his trade, instead deploys a more sophisticated thought process when\nassessing tools. And after applying this process to the hay baler, Pritchard was quick\nto sell it: Smith Meadows now purchases all the hay it uses.\nHere’s why…\n“Let’s start by exploring the costs of making hay,” Pritchard said. “First, there’s the\nactual cost of fuel, and repairs, and the shed to keep the baler. You also have to pay\ntaxes on it.” These directly measurable costs, however, were the easy part of his\ndecision. It was instead the “opportunity costs” that required more attention. As he\nelaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I can’t be doing something else. For example, I\nnow use that time instead to raise boilers [chickens \nmeant for eating]. These generate\n\f\npositive cash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I can\nthen use to enhance my soil.” Then there’s the equally subtle issue of assessing the\nsecondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m\nbuying in hay, I’m trading cash for animal protein, as well as manure (once it passes\nthrough the animals’ system), which means I am also getting more nutrients for my land\nin exchange for my money. I’m also avoiding compacting soils by driving heavy\nmachinery over my ground all summer long.”\nWhen making his final decision on the baler, Pritchard moved past the direct\nmonetary costs, which were essentially a wash, and instead shifted his attention to the\nmore nuanced issue of the long-term health of his fields. For the reasons described\npreviously, Pritchard concluded that buying in hay results in healthier fields. And as\nhe summarized: “Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this calculation, the baler had to go.\nNotice the complexity of Pritchard’s tool decision. This complexity underscores an\nimportant reality: The notion that identifying \nsome\n benefit is sufficient to invest money,\ntime, and attention in a tool is near laughable to people in his trade. \nOf course\n a hay\nbaler offers benefits—\nevery\n tool at the farm supply store has something useful to offer.\nAt the same time, \nof course\n it offers negatives as well. Pritchard expected this\ndecision to be nuanced. He began with a clear baseline—in his case, that soil health is\nof fundamental importance to his professional success—and then built off this\nfoundation toward a final call on whether to use a particular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge worker—especially one interested in\ncultivating a deep work habit—you should treat your tool selection with the same\nlevel of care as other skilled workers, such as farmers. Following is my attempt to\ngeneralize this assessment strategy. I call it the \ncraftsman approach\n to tool selection,\na name that emphasizes that tools are ultimately aids to the larger goals of one’s craft.\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:\n Identify the core factors that determine success and\nhappiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors\nsubstantially outweigh its negative impacts.\nNotice that this craftsman approach to tool selection stands in opposition to the\nany-benefit approach. Whereas the any-benefit mind-set identifies any potential\npositive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftsman variant requires that\nthese positive impacts affect factors at the core of what’s important to you and that\nthey outweigh the negatives.\nEven though the craftsman approach rejects the simplicity of the any-benefit\napproach, it doesn’t ignore the benefits that currently drive people to network tools, or\nmake any advance proclamations about what’s “good” or “bad” technology: It simply\n\f\nasks that you give any particular network tool the same type of measured, nuanced\naccounting that tools in other trades have been subjected to throughout the history of\nskilled labor.\nThe three strategies that follow in this rule are designed to grow your comfort with\nabandoning the any-benefit mind-set and instead applying the more thoughtful\ncraftsman philosophy in curating the tools that lay claim to your time and attention.\nThis guidance is important because the craftsman approach is not cut-and-dry.\nIdentifying what matters most in your life, and then attempting to assess the impacts of\nvarious tools on these factors, doesn’t reduce to a simple formula—this task requires\npractice and experimentation. The strategies that follow provide some structure for\nthis practice and experimentation by forcing you to reconsider your network tools from\nmany different angles. Combined, they should help you cultivate a more sophisticated\nrelationship with your tools that will allow you to take back enough control over your\ntime and attention to enable the rest of the ideas in Part 2 to succeed.\nApply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits\nMalcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. In a 2013 interview he explained why: “Who\nsays my fans want to hear from me on Twitter?” He then joked: “I know a lot of\npeople would like to see less of me.” Michael Lewis, another mega-bestselling author,\nalso doesn’t use the service, explaining in The Wire: “I don’t tweet, I don’t Twitter, I\ncouldn’t even tell you how to read or where to find a Twitter message.” And as\nmentioned in Part 1, the award-winning \nNew Yorker\n \nscribe George Packer also avoids\nthe service, and indeed only recently even succumbed to the necessity of owning a\nsmartphone.\nThese three writers don’t think Twitter is useless. They’re quick to accept that\nother writers find it useful. Packer’s admission of non-Twitter use, in fact, was written\nas a response to an unabashedly pro-Twitter article by the late \nNew York Times\n media\ncritic David Carr, a piece in which Carr effused:\nAnd now, nearly a year later, has Twitter turned my brain to mush? No, I’m\nin narrative on more things in a given moment than I ever thought possible,\nand instead of spending a half-hour surfing in search of illumination, I get a\nsense of the day’s news and how people are reacting to it in the time that it\ntakes to wait for coffee at Starbucks.\nAt the same time, however, Gladwell, Lewis, and Packer don’t feel like the\nservice offers them nearly enough advantages to offset its negatives in their particular\n\f\ncircumstances. Lewis, for example, worries that adding more accessibility will sap\nhis energy and reduce his ability to research and write great stories, noting: “It’s\namazing how overly accessible people are. There’s a lot of communication in my life\nthat’s not enriching, it’s impoverishing.” While Packer, for his part, worries about\ndistraction, saying: “Twitter is crack for media addicts.” He goes so far as to describe\nCarr’s rave about the service as “the most frightening picture of the future that I’ve\nread thus far in the new decade.”\nWe don’t have to argue about whether these authors are right in their personal\ndecisions to avoid Twitter (and similar tools), because their sales numbers and\nawards speak for themselves. We can instead use these decisions as a courageous\nillustration of the craftsman approach to tool selection in action. In a time when so\nmany knowledge workers—and especially those in creative fields—are still trapped\nin the any-benefit mind-set, it’s refreshing to see a more mature approach to sorting\nthrough such services. But the very rareness of these examples reminds us that mature\nand confident assessments of this type aren’t easy to make. Recall the complexity of\nthe thought process, highlighted earlier, that Forrest Pritchard had to slog through to\nmake a decision on his hay baler: For many knowledge workers, and many of the tools\nin their lives, these decisions will be equally complex. The goal of this strategy,\ntherefore, is to offer some structure to this thought process—a way to reduce some of\nthe complexity of deciding which tools really matter to you.\nThe first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your\nprofessional and your personal life. If you have a family, for example, then your\npersonal goals might involve parenting well and running an organized household. In\nthe professional sphere, the details of these goals depend on what you do for a living.\nIn my own work as a professor, for example, I pursue two important goals, one\ncentered on being an effective teacher in the classroom and effective mentor to my\ngraduate students, and another centered on being an effective researcher. While your\ngoals will \nlikely differ, the key is to keep the list limited to what’s most important and\nto keep the descriptions suitably high-level. (If your goal includes a specific target\n—“to reach a million dollars in sales” or “to publish a half dozen papers in a single\nyear”—then it’s too specific for our purposes here.) When you’re done you should\nhave a small number of goals for both the personal and professional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important\nactivities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be specific enough to\nallow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other hand, they should be general\nenough that they’re not tied to a onetime outcome. For example, “do better research” is\n\f\ntoo general (what does it look like to be “doing better research”?), while “finish paper\non broadcast lower bounds in time for upcoming conference submission” is too\nspecific (it’s a onetime outcome). A good activity in this context would be something\nlike: “regularly read and understand the cutting-edge results in my field.”\nThe next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use. For\neach such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of\nthe tool has a \nsubstantially positive impact\n, a \nsubstantially negative impact\n, or \nlittle\nimpact\n on your regular and successful participation in the activity. Now comes the\nimportant decision: Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial\npositive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.\nTo help illustrate this strategy in action, let’s consider a case study. For the\npurposes of this example, assume that \nMichael Lewis, if asked, would have produced\nthe following goal and corresponding important activities for his writing career.\nProfessional Goal\n: To craft well-written, narrative-driven stories that change the\nway people understand the world.\n \nKey Activities Supporting This Goal\n:\n• Research patiently and deeply.\n• Write carefully and with purpose.\nNow imagine that Lewis was using this goal to determine whether or not to use\nTwitter. Our strategy requires him to investigate Twitter’s impact on the key activities\nhe listed that support his goal. There’s no convincing way to argue that Twitter would\nmake Lewis substantially better at either of these activities. Deep research for Lewis,\nI assume, requires him to spend weeks and months getting to know a small number of\nsources (he’s a master of the long-form journalism skill of drawing out a source’s\nstory over many sessions), and careful writing, of course, requires freedom from\ndistraction. In both cases, Twitter at best has no real impact, and at worst could be\nsubstantially negative, depending on Lewis’s susceptibility to the service’s addictive\nattributes. The conclusion would therefore be that Lewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that confining our example to this single goal is\nartificial, as it ignores the areas where a service like Twitter has its best chance of\ncontributing. For writers, in particular, Twitter is often presented as a tool to \nestablish\nconnections with your audience that ultimately lead to more sales. For a writer like\nMichael Lewis, however, marketing doesn’t likely merit its own goal when he\n\f\nassesses what’s important in his professional life. This follows because his reputation\nguarantees that he will receive massive coverage in massively influential media\nchannels, \nif\n the book is really good. His focus, therefore, is much more productively\napplied to the goal of writing the best possible book than instead trying to squeeze out\na few extra sales through inefficient author-driven means. In other words, the question\nis not whether Twitter has some conceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s instead whether\nTwitter use significantly and positively affects the most important activities in his\nprofessional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer? In this case, book marketing might play a more\nprimary role in his or her goals. But when forced to identify the two or three most\nimportant activities supporting this goal, it’s unlikely that the type of lightweight one-\non-one contact enabled by Twitter would make the list. This is the result of simple\nmath. Imagine that our hypothetical author diligently sends ten individualized tweets a\nday, five days a week—each of which connects one-on-one with a new potential\nreader. Now imagine that 50 percent of the people contacted in this manner become\nloyal fans who will definitely buy the author’s next book. Over the two-year period it\nmight take to write this book, this yields two thousand sales—a modest boost at best in\na marketplace where bestseller status requires two or three times more sales \nper\nweek\n. The question once again is not whether Twitter offers \nsome\n benefits, but instead\nwhether it offers \nenough\n benefits to offset its drag on your time and attention (two\nresources that are especially valuable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this approach applied to a professional context, let’s\nnext consider the potentially more disruptive setting of personal goals. In particular,\nlet’s apply this approach to one of our culture’s most ubiquitous and fiercely defended\ntools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook (or similar social networks), most people cite\nits importance to their social lives. With this in mind, let’s apply our strategy to\nunderstand whether Facebook makes the cut due to its positive impact on this aspect of\nour personal goals. To do so, we’ll once again work with a hypothetical goal and key\nsupporting activities.\nPersonal Goal\n: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a group of\npeople who are important to me.\n \nKey Activities Supporting This Goal\n:\n1. Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who are most\n\f\nimportant to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity).\n2. Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making nontrivial\nsacrifices that improve their lives).\nNot everyone will share this exact goal or supporting activities, but hopefully\nyou’ll stipulate that they apply to \nmany people. Let’s now step back and apply our\nstrategy’s filtering logic to the example of Facebook in the context of this personal\ngoal. This service, of course, offers any number of benefits to your social life. To\nname a few that are often mentioned: It allows you to catch up with people you haven’t\nseen in a while, it allows you to maintain lightweight contact with people you know\nbut don’t run into regularly, it allows you to more easily monitor important events in\npeople’s lives (such as whether or not they’re married or what their new baby looks\nlike), and it allows you to stumble onto online communities or groups that match your\ninterests.\nThese are real benefits that Facebook undeniably offers, but none of these benefits\nprovide a significant positive impact to the two key activities we listed, both of which\nare offline and effort intensive. Our strategy, therefore, would return a perhaps\nsurprising but clear conclusion: \nOf course Facebook offers benefits to your social\nlife, but none are important enough to what really matters to you in this area to\njustify giving it access to your time and attention\n.\n*\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that everyone should stop using Facebook. I’m instead\nshowing that for this specific (representative) case study, the strategy proposed here\nwould suggest dropping this service. I can imagine, however, other plausible\nscenarios that would lead to the opposite \nconclusion. Consider, for example, a college\nfreshman. For someone in this situation, it might be more important to establish new\nfriendships than to support existing relationships. The activities this student identifies\nfor supporting his goal of a thriving social life, therefore, might include something\nlike, “attend lots of events and socialize with lots of different people.” If this is a key\nactivity, and you’re on a college campus, then a tool like Facebook would have a\nsubstantially positive impact and \nshould be used\n.\nTo give another example, consider someone in the military who’s deployed\noverseas. For this hypothetical soldier, keeping in frequent lightweight touch with\nfriends and family left back home is a plausible priority, and one that might once again\nbe best supported through social networks.\nWhat should be clear from these examples is that this strategy, if applied as\ndescribed, will lead many people who currently use tools like Facebook or Twitter to\n\f\nabandon them—but not everyone. You might, at this point, complain about the\narbitrariness of allowing only a small number of activities to dominate your decisions\nabout such tools. As we established previously, for example, Facebook has many\nbenefits to your social life; why would one abandon it just because it doesn’t happen\nto help the small number of activities that we judged most important? What’s key to\nunderstand here, however, is that this radical reduction of priorities is not arbitrary,\nbut is instead motivated by an idea that has arisen repeatedly in any number of\ndifferent fields, from client profitability to social equality to prevention of crashes in\ncomputer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few\n*\n:\n In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the\npossible causes.\nFor example, it might be the case that 80 percent of a business’s profits come from\njust 20 percent of its clients, 80 percent of a nation’s wealth is held by its richest 20\npercent of citizens, or 80 percent of computer software crashes come from just 20\npercent of the identified bugs. There’s a formal mathematical underpinning to this\nphenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly what you would expect when describing a\npower law\n distribution over impact—a type of distribution that shows up often when\nmeasuring quantities in the real world), but it’s probably most useful when applied\nheuristically as a reminder that, in many cases, contributions to an outcome are not\nevenly distributed.\nMoving forward, let’s assume that this law holds for the important goals in your\nlife. As we noted, many different activities can contribute to your achieving these\ngoals. The law of the vital few, however, reminds us that the most important 20\npercent or so of these activities provide the bulk of the benefit. Assuming that you\ncould probably list somewhere between ten and fifteen distinct and potentially\nbeneficial activities for each of your life goals, this law says that it’s the top two or\nthree such activities—the number \nthat this strategy asks you to focus on—that make\nmost of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal.\nEven if you accept this result, however, you still might argue that you shouldn’t\nignore the other 80 percent of possible beneficial activities. It’s true that these less\nimportant activities don’t contribute nearly as much to your goal as your top one or\ntwo, but they can provide \nsome\n benefit, so why not keep them in the mix? As long as\nyou don’t ignore the more important activities, it seems like it can’t hurt to also\nsupport some of the less important alternatives.\nThis argument, however, misses the key point that all activities, regardless of their\nimportance, consume your same limited store of time and attention. If you service low-\n\f\nimpact activities, therefore, you’re taking away time you could be spending on higher-\nimpact activities. It’s a zero-sum game. And because your time returns substantially\nmore rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-\nimpact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit.\nThe business world understands this math. This is why it’s not uncommon to see a\ncompany \nfire\n unproductive clients. If 80 percent of their profits come from 20 percent\nof their clients, then they make more money by redirecting the energy from low-\nrevenue clients to better service the small number of lucrative contracts—each hour\nspent on the latter returns more revenue than each hour spent on the former. The same\nholds true for your professional and personal goals. By taking the time consumed by\nlow-impact activities—like finding old friends on Facebook—and reinvesting in \nhigh-\nimpact activities—like taking a good friend out to lunch—you end up more successful\nin your goal. To abandon a network tool using this logic, therefore, is not to miss out\non its potential small benefits, but is instead to get more out of the activities you\nalready know to yield large benefits.\nTo return to where we started, for Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and George\nPacker, Twitter doesn’t support the 20 percent of activities that generate the bulk of\nthe success in their writing careers. Even though in isolation this service might return\nsome minor benefits, when their careers are viewed as a whole, they’re likely more\nsuccessful not using Twitter, and redirecting that time to more fruitful activities, than if\nthey added it into their schedule as one more thing to manage. You should take this\nsame care in deciding which tools you allow to claim your own limited time and\nattention.\nQuit Social Media\nWhen Ryan Nicodemus decided to simplify his life, one of his first targets was his\npossessions. At the time, Ryan lived alone in a spacious three-bedroom condo. For\nyears, driven by a consumerist impulse, he had been trying his best to fill this ample\nspace. Now it was time to reclaim his life from his stuff. The strategy he deployed\nwas simple to describe but radical in concept. He spent an afternoon packing\neverything he owned into cardboard boxes as if he was about to move. In order to\ntransform what he described as a “difficult undertaking” into something less onerous,\nhe called it \na “packing party,” explaining: “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a\nparty, right?”\nOnce the packing was done, Nicodemus then spent the next week going through his\n\f\nnormal routine. If he needed something that was packed, he would unpack it and put it\nback where it used to go. At the end of the week, he noticed that the vast majority of\nhis stuff remained untouched in its boxes.\nSo he got rid of it.\nStuff accumulates in people’s lives, in part, because when faced with a specific act\nof elimination it’s easy to worry, “What if I need this one day?,” and then use this\nworry as an excuse to keep the item in question sitting around. Nicodemus’s packing\nparty provided him with definitive evidence that most of his stuff \nwas not\n something\nhe needed, and it therefore supported his quest to simplify.\nThe last strategy provided a systematic method to help you begin sorting through the\nnetwork tools that currently lay claim to your time and attention. This strategy offers\nyou a different but complementary approach to these same issues, and it’s inspired by\nRyan Nicodemus’s approach to getting rid of his useless stuff.\nIn more detail, this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party\non the social media services that you currently use. Instead of “packing,” however,\nyou’ll instead ban yourself from using them for \nthirty days\n. All of them: Facebook,\nInstagram, Google+, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine—or whatever other services have risen\nto popularity \nsince I first wrote these words. Don’t formally deactivate these services,\nand (this is important) don’t mention online that you’ll be signing off: Just stop using\nthem, cold turkey. If someone reaches out to you by other means and asks why your\nactivity on a particular service has fallen off, you can explain, but don’t go out of your\nway to tell people.\nAfter thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following\ntwo questions about each of the services you temporarily quit:\n1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use\nthis service?\n2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?\nIf your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. If your\nanswer was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service. If your answers are\nqualified or ambiguous, it’s up to you whether you return to the service, though I\nwould encourage you to lean toward quitting. (You can always rejoin later.)\nThis strategy picks specifically on social media because among the different\nnetwork tools that can claim your time and attention, these services, if used without\nlimit, can be particularly devastating to your quest to work deeper. They offer\n\f\npersonalized information arriving on an unpredictable intermittent schedule—making\nthem massively addictive and therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to\nschedule and succeed with any act of concentration. Given these dangers, you might\nexpect that more knowledge \nworkers would avoid these tools altogether—especially\nthose like computer programmers or writers whose livelihood explicitly depends on\nthe outcome of deep work. But part of what makes social media insidious is that the\ncompanies that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing\ncoup: convincing our culture that if you don’t use their products you might \nmiss out\n.\nThis fear that you might miss out has obvious parallels to Nicodemus’s fear that the\nvoluminous stuff in his closets might one day prove useful, which is why I’m\nsuggesting a corrective strategy that parallels his packing party. By spending a month\nwithout these services, you can replace your fear that you might miss out—on events,\non conversations, on shared cultural experience—with a dose of reality. For most\npeople this reality will confirm something that seems obvious only once you’ve done\nthe hard work of freeing yourself from the marketing messages surrounding these tools:\nThey’re not really all that important in your life.\nThe reason why I ask you to not announce your thirty-day experiment is because for\nsome people another part of the delusion that binds them to social media is the idea\nthat people \nwant to hear what you have to say\n, and that they might be disappointed if\nyou suddenly leave them bereft of your commentary. I’m being somewhat facetious\nhere in my wording, but this underlying sentiment is nonetheless common and\nimportant to tackle. As of this writing, for example, the average number of followers\nfor a Twitter user is 208. When you know that more than two hundred people\nvolunteered\n to hear what you have to say, it’s easy to begin to \nbelieve that your\nactivities on these services are important. Speaking from experience as someone who\nmakes a living trying to sell my ideas to people: This is a powerfully addictive\nfeeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in a social media era. Before these services\nexisted, building an audience of any size beyond your immediate friends and family\nrequired hard, competitive work. In the early 2000s, for example, anyone could start a\nblog, but to gain even just a handful of unique visitors per month required that you\nactually put in the work to deliver information that’s valuable enough to capture\nsomeone’s attention. I know this difficulty well. My first blog was started in the fall of\n2003. It was called, cleverly enough, \nInspiring Moniker\n. I used it to muse on my life\nas a twenty-one-year-old college student. There were, I’m embarrassed to admit, long\nstretches where \nno one\n read it (a term I’m using literally). As I learned in the decade\nthat followed, a period in which I patiently and painstakingly built an audience for my\n\f\ncurrent blog, \nStudy Hacks\n, from a handful of readers to hundreds of thousands per\nmonth, is that earning people’s attention online is hard, hard work.\nExcept now it’s not.\nPart of what fueled social media’s rapid assent, I contend, is its ability to short-\ncircuit this connection between the hard work of producing real value and the positive\nreward of having people pay attention to you. It has instead replaced this timeless\ncapitalist exchange with a shallow collectivist alternative: \nI’ll pay attention to what\nyou say if you pay attention to what I say—regardless of its value.\n A blog or\nmagazine or television program that contained the content that typically populates a\nFacebook wall or Twitter feed, for example, would attract, on average, \nno\n audience.\nBut when captured within the social conventions of these services, that same content\nwill attract attention in the form of likes and comments. The implicit agreement\nmotivating this behavior is that in return for receiving (for the most part, undeserved)\nattention from your friends and followers, you’ll return the favor by lavishing\n(similarly undeserved) attention on them. \nYou “like” my status update and I’ll “like”\nyours.\n This agreement gives everyone a simulacrum of importance without requiring\nmuch effort in return.\nBy dropping off these services without notice you can test the reality of your status\nas a content producer. For most people and most services, the news might be sobering\n—no one outside your closest friends and family will likely even notice you’ve signed\noff. I recognize that I come across as curmudgeonly when talking about this issue—is\nthere any other way to tackle it?—but it’s important to discuss because this quest for\nself-importance plays an important role in convincing people to continue to\nthoughtlessly fragment their time and attention.\nFor some people, of course, this thirty-day experiment will be difficult and\ngenerate lots of issues. If you’re a college student or online personality, for example,\nthe abstention will complicate your life and will be noted. But for most, I suspect, the\nnet result of this experiment, if not a massive overhaul in your Internet habits, will be a\nmore grounded view of the role social media plays in your daily existence. \nThese\nservices aren’t necessarily, as advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected\nworld. They’re just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly,\nmarketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal\ninformation and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the scheme of your life\nand what you want to accomplish, they’re a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant\ndistraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper. Or maybe\nsocial media tools are at the core of your existence. You won’t know either way until\n\f\nyou sample life without them.\nDon’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself\nArnold Bennett was an English writer born near the turn of the twentieth century—a\ntumultuous time for his home country’s economy. The industrial revolution, which had\nbeen roaring for decades by this point, had wrenched enough surplus capital from the\nempire’s resources to generate a new class: the white-collar worker. It was now\npossible to have a job in which you spent a set number of hours a week in an office,\nand in exchange received a steady salary sufficient to support a household. Such a\nlifestyle is blandly familiar in our current age, but to Bennett and his contemporaries it\nwas novel and in many ways distressing. Chief among Bennett’s concerns was that\nmembers of this new class were missing out on the opportunities it presented to live a\nfull life.\n“Take the case of a Londoner who works in an office, whose office hours are from\nten to six, and who spends fifty \nminutes morning and night in travelling between his\nhouse door and his office door,” Bennett writes in his 1910 self-help classic, \nHow to\nLive on 24 Hours a Day\n. This hypothetical London salaryman, he notes, has a little\nmore than sixteen hours left in the day beyond these work-related hours. To Bennett,\nthis is a lot of time, but most people in this situation tragically don’t realize its\npotential. The “great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to\nhis day,” he elaborates, is that even though he doesn’t particularly enjoy his work\n(seeing it as something to “get through”), “he persists in looking upon those hours from\nten to six as ‘the day,’ to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours\nfollowing them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue.” This is an attitude that\nBennett condemns as “utterly illogical and unhealthy.”\nWhat’s the alternative to this state of affairs? Bennett suggests that his typical man\nsee his sixteen free hours as a “day within a day,” explaining, “during those sixteen\nhours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares;\nhe is just as good as a man with a private income.” Accordingly, the typical man\nshould instead use this time as an aristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-\nimprovement—a task that, according to Bennett, involves, primarily, reading great\nliterature and poetry.\nBennett wrote about these issues more than a century ago. You might expect that in\nthe intervening decades, a period in which this middle class exploded in size\nworldwide, our thinking about leisure time would have evolved. But it has not. If"

    "raw_text": "anything, with the rise of the Internet and \nthe low-brow attention economy it supports,\nthe average forty-hour-a-week employee—especially those in my tech-savvy\nMillennial generation—has seen the quality of his or her leisure time remain\ndegraded, consisting primarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-\ndenominator digital entertainment. If Bennett were brought back to life today, he’d\nlikely fall into despair at the lack of progress in this area of human development.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the moral underpinnings behind Bennett’s\nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the souls and minds of the middle class by reading\npoetry and great books feels somewhat antiquated and classist. But the logical\nfoundation of his proposal, that you both \nshould\n and \ncan\n make deliberate use of your\ntime outside work, remains relevant today—especially with respect to the goal of this\nrule, which is to reduce the impact of network tools on your ability to perform deep\nwork.\nIn more detail, in the strategies discussed so far in this rule, we haven’t spent much\ntime yet on a class of network tools that are particularly relevant to the fight for depth:\nentertainment-focused websites designed to capture and hold your attention for as long\nas possible. At the time of this writing, the most popular examples of such sites\ninclude the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. This list will\nundoubtedly continue to evolve, but what this general category of sites shares is the\nuse of carefully crafted titles and easily digestible content, often honed by algorithms\nto be maximally attention catching.\nOnce you’ve landed on one article in one of these sites, \nlinks on the side or bottom\nof the page beckon you to click on another, then another. Every available trick of\nhuman psychology, from listing titles as “popular” or “trending,” to the use of arresting\nphotos, is used to keep you engaged. At this particular moment, for example, some of\nthe most popular articles on BuzzFeed include, “17 Words That Mean Something\nTotally Different When Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs Winning at Everything.”\nThese sites are especially harmful after the workday is over, where the freedom in\nyour schedule enables them to become central to your leisure time. If you’re waiting in\nline, or waiting for the plot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting to finish eating a meal,\nthey provide a cognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate any chance of boredom. As I\nargued in Rule #2, however, such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind’s\ngeneral ability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really\nwant to concentrate. To make matters worse, these network tools are not something\nyou join and therefore they’re not something you can remove from your life by quitting\n(rendering the previous two strategies irrelevant). They’re always available, just a\n\f\nquick click away.\nFortunately, Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a hundred years\nearlier: \nPut more thought into your leisure time\n. In other words, this strategy\nsuggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t default to whatever catches your\nattention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of\nhow you want to spend your “day within a day.” Addictive websites of the \ntype\nmentioned previously thrive in a vacuum: If you haven’t given yourself something to\ndo in a given moment, they’ll always beckon as an appealing option. If you instead fill\nthis free time with something of more quality, their grip on your attention will loosen.\nIt’s crucial, therefore, that you figure out in advance what you’re going to do with\nyour evenings and weekends before they begin. Structured hobbies provide good\nfodder for these hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your\ntime. A set program of reading, à la Bennett, where you spend regular time each night\nmaking progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is,\nof course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.\nIn my own life, for example, I manage to read a surprising number of books in a\ntypical year, given the demands on my time as a professor, writer, and father (on\naverage, I’m typically reading three to five books at a time). This is possible because\none of my favorite preplanned leisure activities after my kids’ bedtime is to read an\ninteresting book. As a result, my smartphone and computer, and the distractions they\ncan offer, typically remain neglected between the end of the workday and the next\nmorning.\nAt this point you might worry that adding such structure to your relaxation will\ndefeat the purpose of relaxing, which many believe requires complete freedom from\nplans or obligations. Won’t a structured evening leave you exhausted—not refreshed\n—the next day at work? Bennett, to his credit, anticipated this complaint. As he\nargues, such worries misunderstand what energizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the\nvalue of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly\nincrease the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my\ntypical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a\ncontinuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want\nis change—not rest, except in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is spot-on. If you give your mind something\nmeaningful to do throughout \nall\n your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled,\nand begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for\n\f\nhours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on\nyour time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative. Not only will this\npreserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate, but you might even fulfill\nArnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of experiencing, perhaps for the first time, what it\nmeans to live, and not just exist."

    "raw_text": "Rule #4\nDrain the Shallows\nIn the summer of 2007, the software company 37signals (now called Basecamp)\nlaunched an experiment: They shortened their workweek from five days to four. Their\nemployees seemed to accomplish the same amount of work with one less day, so they\nmade this change permanent: Every year, from May through October, 37signals\nemployees work only Monday to Thursday (with the exception of customer support,\nwhich still operates the full week). As company cofounder Jason Fried quipped in a\nblog post about the decision: “People should enjoy the weather in the summer.”\nIt didn’t take long before the grumbles began in the business press. A few months\nafter Fried announced his company’s decision to make four-day weeks permanent,\njournalist Tara Weiss wrote a critical piece for \nForbes\n titled “Why a Four-Day Work\nWeek Doesn’t Work.” She summarized her problem with this strategy as follows:\nPacking 40 hours into four days isn’t necessarily an efficient way to work.\nMany people find that eight hours \nare tough enough; requiring them to stay\nfor an extra two could cause morale and productivity to decrease.\nFried was quick to respond. In a blog post titled “Forbes Misses the Point of the 4-\nDay Work Week,” he begins by agreeing with Weiss’s premise that it \nwould\n be\nstressful for employees to cram forty hours of effort into four days. But, as he clarifies,\nthat’s not what he’s suggesting. “The point of the 4-day work week is about \ndoing less\nwork\n,” he writes. “It’s not about four 10-hour days… it’s about four normalish 8-hour\ndays.”\nThis might seem confusing at first. Fried earlier claimed that his employees get just\nas much done in four days as in five days. Now, however, he’s claiming that his\nemployees are working fewer hours. How can both be true? The difference, it turns\nout, concerns the role of shallow work. As Fried expands:\nVery few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a few good\nhours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics,\nand personal business that permeate the typical workday.\n\f\nFewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical\nworkweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect\nthat time even more. People become stingy with their time and that’s a good\nthing. They don’t waste it on things that just don’t matter. When you have\nfewer hours you usually spend them more wisely.\nIn other words, the reduction in the 37signals workweek disproportionately\neliminated shallow as compared to deep work, and because the latter was left largely\nuntouched, the important stuff continued to get done. The shallow stuff that can seem so\nurgent in the moment turned out to be unexpectedly dispensable.\nA natural reaction to this experiment is to wonder what would happen if 37signals\nhad gone one step further. If eliminating hours of shallow work had little impact on the\nresults produced, what would happen if they not only eliminated shallow work, but\nthen replaced this newly recovered time with more deep work? Fortunately for our\ncuriosity, the company soon put this bolder idea to the test as well.\nFried had always been interested in the policies of technology companies like\nGoogle that gave their employees 20 percent of their time to work on self-directed\nprojects. While he liked this idea, he felt that carving one day out of an otherwise busy\nweek was not enough to support the type of unbroken deep work that generates true\nbreakthroughs. “I’d take 5 days in a row over 5 days spread out over 5 weeks,” he\nexplained. “So our theory is that we’ll see better results when people have a long\nstretch of uninterrupted time.”\nTo test this theory, 37signals implemented something radical: The company gave\nits employees the \nentire month of June\n off to work deeply on their own projects. This\nmonth would be a period free of any shallow work obligations—no status meetings,\nno memos, and, blessedly, no PowerPoint. At the end of the month, the company held a\n“pitch day” in which employees pitched the ideas they’d been working \non.\nSummarizing the experiment in an \nInc.\n magazine article, Fried dubbed it a success.\nThe pitch day produced two projects that were soon put into production: a better suite\nof tools for handling customer support and a data visualization system that helps the\ncompany understand how their customers use their products. These projects are\npredicted to bring substantial value to the company, but they almost certainly would\nnot\n have been produced in the absence of the unobstructed deep work time provided\nto the employees. To tease out their potential required dozens of hours of unimpeded\neffort.\n“How can we afford to put our business on hold for a month to ‘mess around’ with\nnew ideas?” Fried asked rhetorically. “How can we afford not to?”\n\f\n37signals’ experiments highlight an important reality: The shallow work that\nincreasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than\nit often seems in the moment. For most businesses, if you eliminated significant\namounts of this shallowness, their bottom line would likely remain unaffected. And as\nJason Fried discovered, if you not only eliminate shallow work, but also replace this\nrecovered time with more of the deep alternative, not only will the business continue\nto function; it can become \nmore\n successful.\nThis rule asks you to apply these insights to your personal work life. The strategies\nthat follow are designed to help you ruthlessly identify the shallowness in your current\nschedule, then cull it down to minimum levels—leaving more time for the deep efforts\nthat ultimately matter most.\nBefore diving into the details of these strategies, however, we should first confront\nthe reality that there’s a limit to this anti-shallow thinking. The value of deep work\nvastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn’t mean that you must quixotically\npursue a schedule in which \nall\n of your time is invested in depth. For one thing, a\nnontrivial amount of shallow work is needed to maintain most knowledge work jobs.\nYou might be able to avoid checking your e-mail every ten minutes, but you won’t\nlikely last long if you \nnever\n respond to important messages. In this sense, we should\nsee the goal of this rule as taming shallow work’s footprint in your schedule, not\neliminating it.\nThen there’s the issue of cognitive capacity. Deep work is exhausting because it\npushes you toward the limit of your abilities. Performance psychologists have\nextensively studied how much such efforts can be sustained by an individual in a given\nday.\n*\n In their seminal paper on deliberate practice, Anders Ericsson and his\ncollaborators survey these studies. They note that for someone new to such practice\n(citing, in particular, a child in the early stages of developing an expert-level skill), an\nhour a day is a reasonable limit. For those \nfamiliar with the rigors of such activities,\nthe limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.\nThe implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll\nexperience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore,\ndoesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your\nbounded deep efforts for the day. At first, this caveat might seem optimistic. The\ntypical workday is eight hours. The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than\nfour of these hours in a state of true depth. It follows that you can safely spend half the\nday wallowing in the shallows without adverse effect. The danger missed by this\nanalysis is how \neasily\n this amount of time can be consumed, especially once you\n\f\nconsider the impact of meetings, appointments, calls, and other scheduled events. For\nmany jobs, these time drains can leave you with surprisingly little time left for solo\nwork.\nMy job as a professor, for example, is traditionally less plagued by such\ncommitments, but even so, they often take large chunks out of my time, especially\nduring the academic year. Turning to a random day in my calendar from the previous\nsemester (I’m writing this during a quiet summer month), for example, I see I had a\nmeeting from eleven to twelve, another from one to two thirty, and a class to teach\nfrom three to five. My eight-hour workday in this example is already reduced by four\nhours. Even if I squeezed all remaining shallow work (e-mails, tasks) into a single\nhalf hour, I’d still fall short of the goal of four hours of daily deep work. Put another\nway, even though we’re not capable of spending \na full day in a state of blissful depth,\nthis reality shouldn’t reduce the urgency of reducing shallow work, as the typical\nknowledge workday is more easily fragmented than many suspect.\nTo summarize, I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion because its\ndamage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. This\ntype of work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t\nimpede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately\ndetermine your impact. The strategies that follow will help you act on this reality.\nSchedule Every Minute of Your Day\nIf you’re between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four years old and live in Britain,\nyou likely watch more television than you realize. In 2013, the British TV licensing\nauthority surveyed television watchers about their habits. The twenty-five-to thirty-\nfour-year-olds taking the survey estimated that they spend somewhere between fifteen\nand sixteen hours per week watching TV. This sounds like a lot, but it’s actually a\nsignificant underestimate. We know this because when it comes to television-watching\nhabits, we have access to the ground truth. The Broadcasters’ Audience Research\nBoard (the British equivalent of the American Nielsen Company) places meters in a\nrepresentative sample of households. These meters record, without bias or wishful\nthinking, exactly how much people \nactually\n watch. The twenty-five-to thirty-four-\nyear-olds who thought they \nwatched fifteen hours a week, it turns out, watch more like\ntwenty-eight hours.\nThis bad estimate of time usage is not unique to British television watching. When\nyou consider different groups self-estimating different behaviors, similar gaps\n\f\nstubbornly remain. In a \nWall Street Journal\n article on the topic, business writer Laura\nVanderkam pointed out several more such examples. A survey by the National Sleep\nFoundation revealed that Americans think they’re sleeping, on average, somewhere\naround seven hours a night. The American Time Use Survey, which has people\nactually measure their sleep, corrected this number to 8.6 hours. Another study found\nthat people who claimed to work sixty to sixty-four hours per week were actually\naveraging more like forty-four hours per week, while those claiming to work more\nthan seventy-five hours were actually working less than fifty-five.\nThese examples underscore an important point: We spend much of our day on\nautopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our time. \nThis is a\nproblem\n. It’s difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your\nschedule if you don’t face, without flinching, your current balance between deep and\nshallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, “What\nmakes the most sense right now?” The strategy described in the following paragraphs\nis designed to force you into these behaviors. It’s an idea that might seem extreme at\nfirst but will soon prove indispensable in your quest to take full advantage of the value\nof deep work: \nSchedule every minute of your day\n.\nHere’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined\npaper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page,\nmark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you\ntypically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into\nblocks\n and assign activities to the blocks. For example, you might block off nine a.m.\nto eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. To do so, actually draw a box that\ncovers the lines corresponding to these hours, then write “press release” inside the\nbox. Not every block need be dedicated to a work task. There might be time blocks for\nlunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a\nblock should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). This means, for example,\nthat instead of having a unique small box for each small task on your plate for the day\n—\nrespond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report\n—\nyou can batch similar things into more generic \ntask blocks\n. You might find it useful, in\nthis case, to draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page\nwhere you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in that block.\nWhen you’re done scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a block.\nYou have, in effect, given every minute of your workday a job. Now as you go through\nyour day, use this schedule to guide you.\nIt’s here, of course, that most people will begin to run into trouble. Two things can\n\f\n(and likely will) go wrong with \nyour schedule once the day progresses. The first is\nthat your estimates will prove wrong. You might put aside two hours for writing a\npress release, for example, and in reality it takes two and a half hours. The second\nproblem is that you’ll be interrupted and new obligations will unexpectedly appear on\nyour plate. These events will also break your schedule.\nThis is okay. If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available\nmoment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in\nthe day. You can turn to a new page. You can erase and redraw blocks. Or do as I do:\nCross out the blocks for the remainder of the day and create new blocks to the right of\nthe old ones on the page (I draw my blocks skinny so I have room for several\nrevisions). On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t\ndespair if this happens. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s\ninstead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time\ngoing forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day\nunfolds.\nIf you find that schedule revisions become overwhelming in their frequency, there\nare a few tactics that can inject some more stability. First, you should recognize that\nalmost definitely\n you’re going to underestimate at first how much time you require for\nmost things. When people are new to this habit, they tend to use their schedule as an\nincarnation of wishful thinking—a best-case scenario for their day. Over time, you\nshould make an effort to accurately (if not somewhat conservatively) predict the time\ntasks will require.\nThe second tactic that helps is the use of \noverflow conditional\n blocks. If you’re not\nsure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this\nwith an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the\npreceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it. If you finish the\nactivity on time, however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block\n(for example, some nonurgent tasks). This allows unpredictability in your day without\nrequiring you to keep changing your schedule on paper. For example, returning to our\npress release example, you might schedule two hours for writing the press release, but\nthen follow it by an additional hour block that you can use to keep writing the release,\nif needed, but otherwise assign to catching up with e-mail.\nThe third tactic I suggest is to be liberal with your use of task blocks. Deploy many\nthroughout your day and make them longer than required to handle the tasks you plan in\nthe morning. Lots of things come up during the typical knowledge worker’s day:\nHaving regularly occurring blocks of time to address these surprises keeps things\n\f\nrunning smoothly.\nBefore leaving you to put this strategy in practice, I should address a common\nobjection. In my experience pitching the values of daily schedules, I’ve found that\nmany people worry that this level of planning will become burdensomely restrictive.\nHere, for example, is part of a comment from a reader named Joseph on a blog post I\nwrote on this topic:\nI think you far understate the role of uncertainty… I [worry about] readers\napplying these observations too seriously, to the point of an obsessive (and\nunhealthy) relationship with one’s schedule that seems to exaggerate the\nimportance of minute-counting over getting-lost-in-activities, which if we’re\ntalking about artists is often the only really sensible course of action.\nI understand these concerns, and Joseph is certainly not the first to raise them.\nFortunately, however, they’re also easily addressed. In my own daily scheduling\ndiscipline, in addition to regularly scheduling significant blocks of time for\nspeculative thinking and discussion, I maintain a rule that if I stumble onto an\nimportant insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule\nfor the day (with the exception, of course, of things that cannot be skipped). I can then\nstick with this unexpected insight until it loses steam. At this point, I’ll step back and\nrebuild my schedule for any time that remains in the day.\nIn other words, I not only allow spontaneity in my schedule; I encourage it.\nJoseph’s critique is driven by the mistaken idea that the goal of a schedule is to force\nyour behavior into a rigid plan. This type of scheduling, however, isn’t about\nconstraint—it’s instead about thoughtfulness. It’s a simple habit that forces you to\ncontinually take a moment throughout your day and ask: “What makes sense for me to\ndo with the time that remains?” It’s the habit of asking that returns results, not your\nunyielding fidelity to the answer.\nI would go so far as to argue that someone following this \ncombination of\ncomprehensive scheduling and a willingness to adapt or modify the plan as needed\nwill likely experience \nmore\n creative insights than someone who adopts a more\ntraditionally “spontaneous” approach where the day is left open and unstructured.\nWithout structure, it’s easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow—e-mail,\nsocial media, Web surfing. This type of shallow behavior, though satisfying in the\nmoment, is not conducive to creativity. With structure, on the other hand, you can\nensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply\non something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period—the type of commitment\nmore likely to instigate innovation. (Recall, for example, the discussion in Rule #1\n\f\nabout the rigid rituals followed by many great creative thinkers.) And because you’re\nwilling to abandon your plan when an innovative idea arises, you’re just as well\nsuited as the distracted creative to follow up when the muse strikes.\nTo summarize, the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit\nrequires you to treat your time with respect. A good first step toward this respectful\nhandling is the advice outlined here: Decide in advance what you’re going to do with\nevery minute of your workday. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s\nundoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external\nrequests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you\nwant to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.\nQuantify the Depth of Every Activity\nAn advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re\nactually spending in shallow activities. Extracting this insight from your schedules,\nhowever, can become tricky in practice, as it’s not always clear exactly how shallow\nyou should consider a given task. To expand on this challenge, let’s start by reminding\nourselves of the formal definition of shallow work that I introduced in the\nintroduction:\nShallow Work:\n Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These\nefforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.\nSome activities clearly satisfy this definition. Checking e-mail, for example, or\nscheduling a conference call, is unquestionably shallow in nature. But the\nclassification of other activities can be more ambiguous. Consider the following tasks:\n• \nExample #1\n: Editing a draft of an academic article that you and a collaborator\nwill soon submit to a journal.\n• \nExample #2\n: Building a PowerPoint presentation about this quarter’s sales\nfigures.\n• \nExample #3\n: Attending a meeting to discuss the current status of an important\nproject and to agree on the next steps.\nIt’s not obvious at first how to categorize these examples. The first two describe\ntasks that can be quite demanding, and the final example seems important to advance a\nkey work objective. The purpose of this strategy is to give you an accurate metric for\nresolving such ambiguity—providing you with a way to make clear and consistent\n\f\ndecisions about where given work tasks fall on the shallow-to-deep scale. To do so, it\nasks that you evaluate activities by asking a simple (but surprisingly illuminating)\nquestion:\nHow long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized\ntraining in my field to complete this task?\nTo illustrate this approach, let’s apply this question to our examples of ambiguous\ntasks.\n• \nAnalyzing Example #1\n: To properly edit an academic paper requires that you\nunderstand the nuances of the work (so you can make sure it’s being described\nprecisely) and the nuances of the broader literature (so you can make sure it’s being\ncited properly). These requirements require cutting-edge knowledge of an academic\nfield—a task that in the age of specialization takes years of diligent study at the\ngraduate level and beyond. When it comes to this example, the answer to our question\nwould therefore be quite large, perhaps on the scale of fifty to seventy-five months.\n• \nAnalyzing Example #2\n: The second example doesn’t fare so well by this\nanalysis. To create a PowerPoint presentation that describes your quarterly sales\nrequires three things: first, knowledge of how to make a PowerPoint presentation;\nsecond, an understanding of the standard format of these quarterly performance\npresentations within your organization; and third, an understanding of what sales\nmetrics your organization tracks and how to convert them into the right graphs. The\nhypothetical college graduate imagined by our question, we can assume, would\nalready know how to use PowerPoint, and learning the standard format for your\norganization’s presentations shouldn’t require more than a week. The real question,\ntherefore, is how long it takes a bright college graduate to understand the metrics you\ntrack, where to find the results, and how to clean those up and translate them into\ngraphs and charts that are appropriate for a slide presentation. This isn’t a trivial task,\nbut for a bright college grad it wouldn’t require more than an additional month or so of\ntraining—so we can use two months as our conservative answer.\n• \nAnalyzing Example #3\n: Meetings can be tricky to analyze. They can seem\ntedious at times but they’re often also presented as playing a key role in your\norganization’s most important activities. The method presented here helps cut through\nthis veneer. How long would it take to train a bright recent college graduate to take\nyour place in a planning meeting? He or she would have to understand the project well\nenough to know its milestones and the skills of its \nparticipants. Our hypothetical grad\n\f\nmight also need some insight into the interpersonal dynamics and the reality of how\nsuch projects are executed at the organization. At this point, you might wonder if this\ncollege grad would also need a deep expertise in the topic tackled by the project. For\na planning meeting—probably not. Such meetings rarely dive into substantive content\nand tend to feature a lot of small talk and posturing in which participants try to make it\nseem like they’re committing to a lot without actually having to commit. Give a bright\nrecent graduate three months to learn the ropes and he or she could take your place\nwithout issue in such a gabfest. So we’ll use three months as our answer.\nThis question is meant as a thought experiment (I’m not going to ask you to actually\nhire\n a recent college graduate to take over tasks that score low). But the answers it\nprovides will help you objectively quantify the shallowness or depth of various\nactivities. If our hypothetical college graduate requires many months of training to\nreplicate a task, then this indicates that the task leverages hard-won expertise. As\nargued earlier, tasks that leverage your expertise tend to be deep tasks and they can\ntherefore provide a double benefit: They return more value per time spent, and they\nstretch your abilities, leading to improvement. On the other hand, a task that our\nhypothetical college graduate can pick up quickly is one that does not leverage\nexpertise, and therefore it can be understood as shallow.\nWhat should you do with this strategy? Once you know where your activities fall\non the deep-to-shallow scale, bias \nyour time toward the former. When we reconsider\nour case studies, for example, we see that the first task is something that you would\nwant to prioritize as a good use of time, while the second and third are activities of a\ntype that should be minimized—they might feel productive, but their return on (time)\ninvestment is measly.\nOf course, how one biases away from shallow and toward depth is not always\nobvious—even after you know how to accurately label your commitments. This brings\nus to the strategies that follow, which will provide specific guidance on how to\naccomplish this tricky goal.\nAsk Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget\nHere’s an important question that’s rarely asked: \nWhat percentage of my time should\nbe spent on shallow work?\n This strategy suggests that you ask it. If you have a boss, in\nother words, have a conversation about this question. (You’ll probably have to first\ndefine for him or her what “shallow” and “deep” work means.) If you work for\nyourself, ask \nyourself\n this question. In both cases, settle on a specific answer. Then—\n\f\nand this is the important part—try to stick to this budget. (The strategies that precede\nand follow this one will help you achieve this goal.)\nFor most people in most non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the answer to the\nquestion will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range (there’s a psychological\ndistaste surrounding the idea of spending the \nmajority\n of your time on unskilled tasks,\nso 50 percent is a natural upper limit, \nwhile at the same time most bosses will begin to\nworry that if this percentage gets too much lower than 30 percent you’ll be reduced to\na knowledge work hermit who thinks big thoughts but never responds to e-mails).\nObeying this budget will likely require changes to your behavior. You’ll almost\ncertainly end up forced into saying no to projects that seem infused with shallowness\nwhile also more aggressively reducing the amount of shallowness in your existing\nprojects. This budget might lead you to drop the need for a weekly status meeting in\npreference for results-driven reporting (“let me know when you’ve made significant\nprogress; then we’ll talk”). It might also lead you to start spending more mornings in\ncommunication isolation or decide it’s not as important as you once thought to respond\nquickly and in detail to every cc’d e-mail that crosses your inbox.\nThese changes are all positive for your quest to make deep work central to your\nworking life. On the one hand, they don’t ask you to abandon your core shallow\nobligations—a move that would cause problems and resentment—as you’re still\nspending a lot of time on such efforts. On the other hand, they do force you to place a\nhard limit on the amount of less urgent obligations you allow to slip insidiously into\nyour schedule. This limit frees up space for significant amounts of deep effort on a\nconsistent basis.\nThe reason why these decisions should start with a conversation with your boss is\nthat this agreement establishes implicit support from your workplace. If you work for\nsomeone else, this strategy provides cover when you turn down an \nobligation or\nrestructure a project to minimize shallowness. You can justify the move because it’s\nnecessary for you to hit your prescribed target mix of work types. As I discussed in\nChapter 2, part of the reason shallow work persists in large quantities in knowledge\nwork is that we rarely see the total impact of such efforts on our schedules. We instead\ntend to evaluate these behaviors one by one in the moment—a perspective from which\neach task can seem quite reasonable and convenient. The tools from earlier in this\nrule, however, allow you to make this impact explicit. You can now confidently say to\nyour boss, “This is the exact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,”\nand force him or her to give explicit approval for that ratio. Faced with these numbers,\nand the economic reality they clarify (it’s incredibly wasteful, for example, to pay a"

    "raw_text": "highly trained professional to send e-mail messages and attend meetings for thirty\nhours a week), a boss will be led to the natural conclusion that you \nneed\n to say no to\nsome things and to streamline others—even if this makes life less convenient for the\nboss, or for you, or for your coworkers. Because, of course, in the end, a business’s\ngoal is to generate value, not to make sure its employees’ lives are as easy as\npossible.\nIf you work for yourself, this exercise will force you to confront the reality of how\nlittle time in your “busy” schedule you’re actually producing value. These hard\nnumbers will provide you the confidence needed to start scaling back on the shallow\nactivities that are sapping your time. Without these numbers, it’s difficult for an\nentrepreneur to say no to \nany opportunity that \nmight\n generate some positive return. “I\nhave to be on Twitter!,” “I have to maintain an active Facebook presence!,” “I have to\ntweak the widgets on my blog!,” you tell yourself, because when considered in\nisolation, to say no to any one of these activities seems like you’re being lazy. By\ninstead picking and sticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-\ndriven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of trying to get the most\nout of the time you put aside for shallow work (therefore still exposing yourself to\nmany opportunities), but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of\nyour time and attention to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business\nforward.\nOf course, there’s always the possibility that when you ask this question the answer\nis stark. No boss will explicitly answer, “One hundred percent of your time should be\nshallow!” (unless you’re entry level, at which point you need to delay this exercise\nuntil you’ve built enough skills to add deep efforts to your official work\nresponsibilities), but a boss might reply, in so many words, “as much shallow work as\nis needed for you to promptly do whatever we need from you at the moment.” In this\ncase, the answer is still useful, as it tells you that this isn’t a job that supports deep\nwork, and a job that doesn’t support deep work is not a job that can help you succeed\nin our current information economy. You should, in this case, thank the boss for the\nfeedback, and then promptly start planning how you can transition into a new position\nthat values depth.\nFinish Your Work by Five Thirty\nIn the seven days preceding my first writing these words, I participated in sixty-five\ndifferent e-mail conversations. Among these sixty-five conversations, I sent exactly\nfive e-mails after five thirty p.m. The immediate story told by these statistics is that,\n\f\nwith few exceptions, I don’t send e-mails after five thirty. But given how intertwined\ne-mail has become with work in general, there’s a more surprising reality hinted by\nthis behavior: I don’t \nwork\n after five thirty p.m.\nI call this commitment \nfixed-schedule productivity\n, as I fix the firm goal of not\nworking past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that\nallow me to satisfy this declaration. I’ve practiced fixed-schedule productivity\nhappily for more than half a decade now, and it’s been crucial to my efforts to build a\nproductive professional life centered on deep work. In the pages ahead, I will try to\nconvince you to adopt this strategy as well.\nLet me start my pitch for fixed-schedule productivity by first noting that, according to\nconventional wisdom, in the academic world I inhabit this tactic should fail.\nProfessors—especially junior professors—are notorious for adopting grueling\nschedules that extend into the night and through weekends. Consider, for example, a\nblog post published by a young computer science professor whom I’ll call “Tom.” In\nthis post, which Tom wrote in the winter of 2014, he replicates his schedule for a\nrecent day in which he spent \ntwelve hours at his office. This schedule includes five\ndifferent meetings and three hours of “administrative” tasks, which he describes as\n“tending to bushels of e-mails, filling out bureaucratic forms, organizing meeting\nnotes, planning future meetings.” By his estimation, he spent only \none and a half\n out of\nthe twelve total hours sitting in his office tackling “real” work, which he defines as\nefforts that make progress toward a “research deliverable.” It’s no wonder that Tom\nfeels coerced into working well beyond the standard workday. “I’ve already accepted\nthe reality that I’ll be working on weekends,” he concludes in another post. “Very few\njunior faculty can avoid such a fate.”\nAnd yet, \nI have\n. Even though I don’t work at night and rarely work on weekends,\nbetween arriving at Georgetown in the fall of 2011 and beginning work on this chapter\nin the fall of 2014, I’ve published somewhere around twenty peer-reviewed articles. I\nalso won two competitive grants, published one (nonacademic) book, and have almost\nfinished writing another (which you’re reading at the moment). All while avoiding the\ngrueling schedules deemed necessary by the Toms of the world.\nWhat explains this paradox? We can find a compelling answer in a widely\ndisseminated article published in 2013 by an academic further along in her career, and\nfar more accomplished than I: Radhika Nagpal, the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer\nScience at Harvard University. Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the\nstress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed. “Scary myths and scary\ndata abound about life as a tenure-track faculty at an \n‘R1’ [research-focused]\n\f\nuniversity,” she begins, before continuing to explain how she finally decided to\ndisregard the conventional wisdom and instead “deliberately… do specific things to\npreserve my happiness.” This deliberate effort led Nagpal to enjoy her pre-tenure time\n“tremendously.”\nNagpal goes on to detail several examples of these efforts, but there’s one tactic in\nparticular that should sound familiar. As Nagpal admits, early in her academic career\nshe found herself trying to cram work into every free hour between seven a.m. and\nmidnight (because she has kids, this time, especially in the evening, was often severely\nfractured). It didn’t take long before she decided this strategy was unsustainable, so\nshe set a limit of fifty hours a week and worked backward to determine what rules and\nhabits were needed to satisfy this constraint. Nagpal, in other words, deployed fixed-\nschedule productivity.\nWe know this strategy didn’t hurt her academic career, as she ended up earning\ntenure on schedule and then jumping to the full professor level after only three\nadditional years (an impressive ascent). How did she pull this off? According to her\narticle, one of the main techniques for respecting her hour limit was to set drastic\nquotas on the major sources of \nshallow\n endeavors in her academic life. For example,\nshe decided she would travel only five times per year for any purpose, as trips can\ngenerate a surprisingly large load of urgent shallow obligations (from making lodging\narrangements to writing talks). Five trips a year may still sound like a lot, but for an\nacademic it’s light. To emphasize this point, note that Matt Welsh, a former colleague\nof Nagpal in the Harvard \ncomputer science department (he now works for Google)\nonce wrote a blog post in which he claimed it was typical for junior faculty to travel\ntwelve to twenty-four times a year. (Imagine the shallow efforts Nagpal avoided in\nsidestepping an extra ten to fifteen trips!) The travel quota is just one of several tactics\nthat Nagpal used to control her workday (she also, for example, placed limits on the\nnumber of papers she would review per year), but what all her tactics shared was a\ncommitment to ruthlessly capping the shallow while protecting the deep efforts—that\nis, original research—that ultimately determined her professional fate.\nReturning to my own example, it’s a similar commitment that enables me to\nsucceed with fixed scheduling. I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most\ndangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes a lot to convince me\nto agree to something that yields shallow work. If you ask for my involvement in\nuniversity business that’s not absolutely necessary, I might respond with a defense I\nlearned from the department chair who hired me: “Talk to me after tenure.” Another\ntactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my\nexplanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the\n\f\nexcuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I turn down a\ntime-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I have other trips scheduled\nfor around the same time, I don’t provide details—which might leave the requester the\nability to suggest a way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations—but instead\njust say, “Sounds interesting, but \nI can’t make it due to schedule conflicts.” In turning\ndown obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up\ndevouring almost as much of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but\nI’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they come together and offer my\nthoughts”). A clean break is best.\nIn addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly conscientious about\nmanaging my time. Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to allow a\nlarge deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial,\nbecause I didn’t take a moment to craft a smart plan. The Damoclean cap on the\nworkday enforced by fixed-schedule productivity has a way of keeping my\norganization efforts sharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d likely end up more lax in\nmy habits.\nTo summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in academia\nwithout Tom-style overload due to two reasons. First, we’re asymmetric in the culling\nforced by our fixed-schedule commitment. By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while\npreserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of\nnew value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in\nshallow frees up \nmore\n energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more\nthan if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the limits to our\ntime necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits, also leading to\nmore value produced as compared to longer but less organized schedules.\nThe key claim of this strategy is that these same benefits \nhold for most knowledge\nwork fields. That is, even if you’re not a professor, fixed-schedule productivity can\nyield powerful benefits. In most knowledge work jobs, it can be difficult in the\nmoment to turn down a shallow commitment that seems harmless in isolation—be it\naccepting an invitation to get coffee or agreeing to “jump on a call.” A commitment to\nfixed-schedule productivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly\nany obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially\ndisruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to your time\nand attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the efforts that pass these\nobstacles with a ruthless efficiency. It might also lead you to test assumptions about\nyour company’s work culture that you thought were ironclad but turn out to be\nmalleable. It’s common, for example, to receive e-mails from your boss after hours."

Many suspect that this would cause problems, as such responses are\nexpected\n, but in many cases, the fact that your boss happens to be clearing her inbox at\nnight doesn’t mean that she expects an immediate response—a lesson this strategy\nwould soon help you discover.\nFixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a \nmeta-habit\n that’s simple to adopt\nbut broad in its impact. If you have to choose just one behavior that reorients your\nfocus toward the deep, this one should be high on your list of possibilities. If you’re\nstill not sure, however, about the idea that artificial limits on your workday can make\nyou more successful, I urge you to once again turn your attention to \nthe career of fixed-\nschedule advocate Radhika Nagpal. In a satisfying coincidence, at almost the exact\nsame time that Tom was lamenting online about his unavoidably intense workload as a\nyoung professor, Nagpal was celebrating the latest of the many professional triumphs\nshe has experienced despite her fixed schedule: Her research was featured on the\ncover of the journal \nScience\n.\nBecome Hard to Reach\nNo discussion of shallow work is complete without considering e-mail. This\nquintessential shallow activity is particularly insidious in its grip on most knowledge\nworkers’ attention, as it delivers a steady stream of distractions \naddressed\nspecifically to you\n. Ubiquitous e-mail access has become so ingrained in our\nprofessional habits that we’re beginning to lose the sense that we have any say in its\nrole in our life. As John Freeman warns in his 2009 book, \nThe Tyranny of E-mail\n,\nwith the rise of this technology “we are slowly eroding our ability to explain—in a\ncareful, complex way—why it is so wrong for us to complain, resist, or redesign our\nworkdays so that they are manageable.” E-mail seems a fait accompli. Resistance is\nfutile.\nThis strategy pushes back at this fatalism. Just because you cannot avoid this tool\naltogether doesn’t mean you have to cede all authority over its role in your mental\nlandscape. In the following sections I describe three tips that will help you regain\nauthority over how this technology accesses your time and attention, and arrest the\nerosion of autonomy identified \nby Freeman.

    "raw_text": "Most nonfiction authors are easy to reach. They include an e-mail address on their\nauthor websites along with an open invitation to send them any request or suggestion\nthat comes to mind. Many even encourage this feedback as a necessary commitment to\nthe elusive but much-touted importance of “community building” among their readers.\nBut here’s the thing: \nI don’t buy it.\nIf you visit the contact page on my author website, there’s no general-purpose e-\nmail address. Instead, I list different individuals you can contact for specific purposes:\nmy literary agent for rights requests, for example, or my speaking agent for speaking\nrequests. If you want to reach me, I offer only a special-purpose e-mail address that\ncomes with conditions and a lowered expectation that I’ll respond:\nIf you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my life\nmore interesting, e-mail me at \ninteresting [at] calnewport.com\n. For the\nreasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good\nmatch for my schedule and interests.\nI call this approach a \nsender filter\n, as I’m asking my correspondents to filter\nthemselves before attempting to contact \nme. This filter has significantly reduced the\ntime I spend in my inbox. Before I began using a sender filter, I had a standard\ngeneral-purpose e-mail address listed on my website. Not surprisingly, I used to\nreceive a large volume of long e-mails asking for advice on specific (and often quite\ncomplicated) student or career questions. I like to help individuals, but these requests\nbecame overwhelming—they didn’t take the senders long to craft but they would\nrequire a lot of explanation and writing on my part to respond. My sender filter has\neliminated most such communication, and in doing so, has drastically reduced the\nnumber of messages I encounter in my writing inbox. As for my own interest in helping\nmy readers, I now redirect this energy toward settings I carefully choose to maximize\nimpact. Instead of allowing any student in the world to send me a question, for\nexample, I now work closely with a small number of student groups where I’m quite\naccessible and can offer more substantial and effective mentoring.\nAnother benefit of a sender filter is that it resets expectations. The most crucial line\nin my description is the following: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a\ngood match for my schedule and interests.” This seems minor, but it makes a\nsubstantial difference in how my correspondents think about their messages to me. The\ndefault social convention surrounding e-mail is that unless you’re famous, if someone\nsends you something, you owe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full\nof messages generates a major sense of obligation.\nBy instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations \nto the reality that you’ll\n\f\nprobably \nnot\n respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is now a collection of\nopportunities that you can glance at when you have the free time—seeking out those\nthat make sense for you to engage. But the pile of unread messages no longer generates\na sense of obligation. You could, if you wanted to, ignore them all, and nothing bad\nwould happen. Psychologically, this can be freeing.\nI worried when I first began using a sender filter that it would seem pretentious—\nas if my time was more valuable than that of my readers—and that it would upset\npeople. But this fear wasn’t realized. Most people easily accept the idea that you have\na right to control \nyour own\n incoming communication, as they would like to enjoy this\nsame right. More important, people appreciate clarity. Most are okay to not receive a\nresponse if they don’t expect one (in general, those with a minor public presence, such\nas authors, overestimate how much people really care about their replies to their\nmessages).\nIn some cases, this expectation reset might even earn you \nmore\n credit when you do\nrespond. For example, an editor of an online publication once sent me a guest post\nopportunity with the assumption, set by my filter, that I would likely not respond.\nWhen I did, it proved a happy surprise. Here’s her summary of the interaction:\nSo, when I emailed Cal to ask if he wanted to contribute to [the publication],\nmy expectations were set. He didn’t have anything on his [sender filter]\nabout wanting to guest blog, so there wouldn’t have been any hard \nfeelings if\nI’d never heard a peep. Then, when he did respond, I was thrilled.\nMy particular sender filter is just one example of this general strategy. Consider\nconsultant Clay Herbert, who is an expert in running crowd-funding campaigns for\ntechnology start-ups: a specialty that attracts a lot of correspondents hoping to glean\nsome helpful advice. As a Forbes.com article on sender filters reports, “At some\npoint, the number of people reaching out exceeded [Herbert’s] capacity, so he created\nfilters that put the onus on the person asking for help.”\nThough he started from a similar motivation as me, Herbert’s filters ended up\ntaking a different form. To contact him, you must first consult an FAQ to make sure\nyour question has not already been answered (which was the case for a lot of the\nmessages Herbert was processing before his filters were in place). If you make it\nthrough this FAQ sieve, he then asks you to fill out a survey that allows him to further\nscreen for connections that seem particularly relevant to his expertise. For those who\nmake it past this step, Herbert enforces a small fee you must pay before\ncommunicating with him. This fee is not about making extra money, but is instead\nabout selecting for individuals who are serious about receiving and acting on advice.\n\f\nHerbert’s filters still enable him to help people and encounter interesting\nopportunities. But at the same time, they have reduced his incoming communication to\na level he can easily handle.\nTo give another example, consider Antonio Centeno, who runs the popular \nReal\nMan Style\n blog. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step process. If you have a\nquestion, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to\nanswer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations. If you\nmake it past this step, he then makes you commit to, by clicking check boxes, the\nfollowing three promises:\n I am not asking Antonio a style question I could find searching Google for 10\nminutes.\n I am not SPAMMING Antonio with a cut-and-pasting generic request to\npromote my unrelated business.\n I will do a good deed for some random stranger if Antonio responds within 23\nhours.\nThe message box in which you can type your message doesn’t appear on the contact\npage until after you’ve clicked the box by all three promises.\nTo summarize, the technologies underlying e-mail are transformative, but the\ncurrent social conventions guiding how we apply this technology are underdeveloped.\nThe notion that all messages, regardless of purpose or sender, arrive in the same\nundifferentiated inbox, and that there’s an expectation that every message deserves a\n(timely) response, is absurdly unproductive. The sender filter is a small but useful step\ntoward a better state of affairs, and is an idea whose \ntime has come—at least for the\nincreasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming\ncommunication and have the ability to dictate their accessibility. (I’d also love to see\nsimilar rules become ubiquitous for intra-office communication in large organizations,\nbut for the reasons argued in Chapter 2, we’re probably a long way from that reality.)\nIf you’re in a position to do so, consider sender filters as a way of reclaiming some\ncontrol over your time and attention.\nTip #2\n: Do More Work When\n You \nSend or Reply to E-mails\nConsider the following standard e-mails:\nE-mail #1\n: “It was great to meet you last week. I’d love to follow up on some of those\n\f\nissues we discussed. Do you want to grab coffee?”\nE-mail #2\n: “We should get back to the research problem we discussed during my last\nvisit. Remind me where we are with that?”\nE-mail #3\n: “I took a stab at that article we discussed. It’s attached. Thoughts?”\nThese three examples should be familiar to most knowledge workers, as they’re\nrepresentative of many of the messages that fill their inboxes. They’re also potential\nproductivity land mines: How you respond to them will have a significant impact on\nhow much time and attention the resulting conversation ultimately consumes.\nIn particular, interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct to dash off\nthe quickest possible response that will clear the message—temporarily—out of your\ninbox. A quick response will, in the short term, provide you with some minor relief\nbecause you’re bouncing the responsibility implied by the message off your court and\nback onto the sender’s. This relief, however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will\ncontinue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. I\nsuggest, therefore, that the right strategy when faced with a question of this type is to\npause a moment before replying and take the time to answer the following key prompt:\nWhat is the\n project \nrepresented by this message, and what is the most\nefficient (in terms of messages generated)\n process \nfor bringing this project to\na successful conclusion?\nOnce you’ve answered this question for yourself, replace a quick response with\none that takes the time to describe the process you identified, points out the current\nstep, and emphasizes the step that comes next. I call this the \nprocess-centric approach\nto e-mail, and it’s designed to minimize both the number of e-mails you receive and\nthe amount of mental clutter they generate.\nTo better explain this process and why it works consider the following process-\ncentric responses to the sample e-mails from earlier:\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #1\n: “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s meet at the\nStarbucks on campus. Below I listed two days next week when I’m free. For each day,\nI listed three times. If any of those day and time combinations work for you, let me\nknow. I’ll consider your reply confirmation for the meeting. If none of those date and\ntime combinations work, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash out a time\nthat works. Looking forward to it.”\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #2\n: “I agree that we should return to this\nproblem. Here’s what I suggest…\n\f\n“Sometime in the next week e-mail me everything you remember about our\ndiscussion on the problem. Once I receive that message, I’ll start a shared directory\nfor the project and add to it a document that summarizes what you sent me, combined\nwith my own memory of our past discussion. In the document, I’ll highlight the two or\nthree most promising next steps.\n“We can then take a crack at those next steps for a few weeks and check back in. I\nsuggest we schedule a phone call for a month from now for this purpose. Below I\nlisted some dates and times when I’m available for a call. When you respond with\nyour notes, indicate the date and time combination that works best for you and we’ll\nconsider that reply \nconfirmation for the call. I look forward to digging into this\nproblem.”\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail #3\n: “Thanks for getting back to me. I’m going to\nread this draft of the article and send you back an edited version annotated with\ncomments on Friday (the 10th). In this version I send back, I’ll edit what I can do\nmyself, and add comments to draw your attention to places where I think you’re better\nsuited to make the improvement. At that point, you should have what you need to\npolish and submit the final draft, so I’ll leave you to do that—no need to reply to this\nmessage or to follow up with me after I return the edits—unless, of course, there’s an\nissue.”\nIn crafting these sample responses, I started by identifying the project implied by\nthe message. Notice, the word “project” is used loosely here. It can cover things that\nare large and obviously projects, such as making progress on a research problem\n(Example #2), but it applies just as easily to small logistical challenges like setting up\na coffee meeting (Example #1). I then took a minute or two to think through a process\nthat gets us from the current state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages\nrequired. The final step was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and\nwhere we stand. These examples centered on an e-mail reply, but it should be clear\nthat a similar approach also works when writing an e-mail message from scratch.\nThe process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the impact of this\ntechnology on your time and attention. There are two reasons for this effect. First, it\nreduces the number of e-mails in your inbox—sometimes significantly (something as\nsimple as scheduling a coffee meeting can easily spiral into half a dozen or more\nmessages over a period of many days, if you’re not careful about your replies). This,\nin turn, reduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you must\nexpend when you do.\nSecond, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric message\n\f\nimmediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand. When a project is\ninitiated by an e-mail that you send or receive, it squats in your mental landscape—\nbecoming something that’s “on your plate” in the sense that it has been brought to your\nattention and eventually needs to be addressed. This method closes this open loop as\nsoon as it forms. By working through the whole process, adding to your task lists and\ncalendar any relevant commitments on your part, and bringing the other party up to\nspeed, your mind can reclaim the mental real estate the project once demanded. Less\nmental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking.\nProcess-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require\nthat you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In\nthe moment, this might seem like you’re spending \nmore\n time on e-mail. But the\nimportant point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this\npoint will save you \nmany more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra\nmessages later.\nThe other issue is that process-centric messages can seem stilted and overly\ntechnical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail promote a conversational\ntone that clashes with the more systematic schedules or decision trees commonly used\nin process-centric communication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer\nconversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the process-centric\nportion of the message from the conversational opening with a divider line, or label it\n“Proposed Next Steps,” so that its technical tone seems more appropriate in context.\nIn the end, these minor hassles are worth it. By putting more thought up front into\nwhat’s really being proposed by the e-mail messages that flit in and out of your inbox,\nyou’ll greatly reduce the negative impact of this technology on your ability to do work\nthat actually matters.\nTip #3\n: Don’t Respond\nAs a graduate student at MIT, I had the opportunity to interact with famous academics.\nIn doing so, I noticed that many shared a fascinating and somewhat rare approach to e-\nmail: Their default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to \nnot\n respond.\nOver time, I learned the philosophy driving this behavior: When it comes to e-mail,\nthey believed, it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is\nworthwhile. If you didn’t make a convincing case \nand\n sufficiently \nminimize the effort\nrequired by the professor to respond, you didn’t get a response.\nFor example, the following e-mail would likely not generate a reply with many of\n\f\nthe famous names at the Institute:\nHi professor. I’d love to stop by sometime to talk about <topic X>. Are you\navailable?\nResponding to this message requires too much work (“Are you available?” is too\nvague to be answered quickly). Also, there’s no attempt to argue that this chat is worth\nthe professor’s time. With these critiques in mind, here’s a version of the same\nmessage that would be more likely to generate a reply:\nHi professor. I’m working on a project similar to <topic X> with my advisor,\n<professor Y>. Is it okay if I stop by in the last fifteen minutes of your office\nhours on Thursday to explain what we’re up to in more detail and see if it\nmight complement your current project?\nUnlike the first message, this one makes a clear case for why this meeting makes\nsense and minimizes the effort needed from the receiver to respond.\nThis tip asks that you replicate, to the extent feasible in your professional context,\nthis professorial ambivalence to e-mail. To help you in this effort, try applying the\nfollowing three rules to sort through which messages require a response and which do\nnot.\nProfessorial E-mail Sorting\n: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the\nfollowing applies:\n• It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable\nresponse.\n• It’s not a question or proposal that interests you.\n• Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad\nwould happen if you didn’t.\nIn all cases, there are many obvious exceptions. If an ambiguous message about a\nproject you don’t care about comes from your company’s CEO, for example, you’ll\nrespond. But looking beyond these exceptions, this professorial approach asks you to\nbecome way more ruthless when deciding whether or not to click “reply.”\nThis tip can be uncomfortable at first because it will cause you to break a key\nconvention currently surrounding e-mail: Replies are assumed, regardless of the\nrelevance or appropriateness of the message. There’s also no way to avoid that some\nbad things will happen if you take this approach. At the minimum, some people might\nget confused or upset—especially if they’ve never seen standard e-mail conventions\n\f\nquestioned or ignored. Here’s the thing: This is okay. As the author Tim Ferriss once\nwrote: “Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never\nfind time for the life-changing big things.” It should comfort you to realize that, as the\nprofessors at MIT discovered, people are quick to adjust their expectations to the\nspecifics of your communication habits. The fact you didn’t \nrespond to their hastily\nscribed messages is probably not a central event in their lives.\nOnce you get past the discomfort of this approach, you’ll begin to experience its\nrewards. There are two common tropes bandied around when people discuss solutions\nto e-mail overload. One says that sending e-mails generates more e-mails, while the\nother says that wrestling with ambiguous or irrelevant e-mails is a major source of\ninbox-related stress. The approach suggested here responds aggressively to both\nissues—you send fewer e-mails and ignore those that aren’t easy to process—and by\ndoing so will significantly weaken the grip your inbox maintains over your time and\nattention."

    "raw_text": "Conclusion\nThe story of Microsoft’s founding has been told so many times that it’s entered the\nrealm of legend. In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates sees\nthe Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the cover of \nPopular Electronics\n.\nGates realizes that there’s an opportunity to design software for the machine, so he\ndrops everything and with the help of Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff spends the next\neight weeks hacking together a version of the BASIC programming language for the\nAltair. This story is often cited as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but\nrecent interviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s\nhappy ending: Gates’s preternatural deep work ability.\nAs Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article on the topic for the \nHarvard\nGazette\n, Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during this two-month\nstretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his keyboard in the middle of writing\na line of code. He would then sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and pick up right\nwhere he left off—an ability that a still-impressed Paul Allen describes \nas “a\nprodigious feat of concentration.” In his book \nThe Innovators\n, Isaacson later\nsummarized Gates’s unique tendency toward depth as follows: “The one trait that\ndifferentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen’s mind would flit between many\nideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor.”\nIt’s here, in this story of Gates’s obsessive focus, that we encounter the strongest\nform of my argument for deep work. It’s easy, amid the turbulence of a rapidly\nevolving information age, to default to dialectical grumbling. The curmudgeons among\nus are vaguely uneasy about the attention people pay to their phones, and pine for the\ndays of unhurried concentration, while the digital hipsters equate such nostalgia with\nLuddism and boredom, and believe that increased connection is the foundation for a\nutopian future. Marshall McLuhan declared that “the medium is the message,” but our\ncurrent conversation on these topics seems to imply that “the medium is morality”—\neither you’re on board with the Facebook future or see it as our downfall.\nAs I emphasized in this book’s introduction, I have no interest in this debate. A\ncommitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement\n—it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that \ngets\nvaluable things done\n. Deep work is important, in other words, not because distraction\nis evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a"

    "raw_text": "semester.\nThis is also a lesson, as it turns out, that I’ve personally relearned again and again\nin my own career. I’ve been a depth \ndevotee for more than a decade, but even I am\nstill regularly surprised by its power. When I was in graduate school, the period when\nI first encountered and started prioritizing this skill, I found that deep work allowed\nme to write a pair of quality peer-reviewed papers each year (a respectable rate for a\nstudent), while rarely having to work past five on weekdays or work at all on\nweekends (a rarity among my peers).\nAs I neared my transition to professorship, however, I began to worry. As a student\nand a postdoc my time commitments were minimal—leaving me most of my day to\nshape as I desired. I knew I would lose this luxury in the next phase of my career, and\nI wasn’t confident in my ability to integrate enough deep work into this more\ndemanding schedule to maintain my productivity. Instead of just stewing in my anxiety,\nI decided to do something about it: I created a plan to bolster my deep work muscles.\nThese training efforts were deployed during my last two years at MIT, while I was\na postdoc starting to look for professor positions. My main tactic was to introduce\nartificial constraints on my schedule, so as to better approximate the more limited free\ntime I expected as a professor. In addition to my rule about not working at night, I\nstarted to take extended lunch breaks in the middle of the day to go for a run and then\neat lunch back at my apartment. I also signed a deal to write my fourth book, \nSo Good\nThey Can’t Ignore You\n, during this period—a project, of course, that soon levied its\nown intense demands on my time.\nTo compensate for these new constraints, I refined my ability to work deeply.\nAmong other methods, I began to \nmore carefully block out deep work hours and\npreserve them against incursion. I also developed an ability to carefully work through\nthoughts during the many hours I spent on foot each week (a boon to my productivity),\nand became obsessive about finding disconnected locations conducive to focus.\nDuring the summer, for example, I would often work under the dome in Barker\nEngineering library—a pleasingly cavernous location that becomes too crowded when\nclass is in session, and during the winter, I sought more obscure locations for some\nsilence, eventually developing a preference for the small but well-appointed Lewis\nMusic Library. At some point, I even bought a $50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook to\nwork on mathematical proofs, believing that its expense would induce more care in my\nthinking.\nI ended up surprised by how well this recommitment to depth ended up working.\nAfter I’d taken a job as a computer science professor at Georgetown University in the\n\f\nfall of 2011, my obligations did in fact drastically increase. But I had been training for\nthis moment. Not only did I preserve my research productivity; it actually \nimproved\n.\nMy previous rate of two good papers a year, which I maintained as an unencumbered\ngraduate student, leapt to four good papers a year, on average, once I became a much\nmore encumbered professor.\nImpressive as this was to me, however, I was soon to learn that I had not yet\nreached the limits of what deep work could produce. This lesson would come during\nmy third year as a professor. During my third year at Georgetown, which spanned the\nfall of 2013 through the summer of \n2014, I turned my attention back to my deep work\nhabits, searching for more opportunities to improve. A big reason for this\nrecommitment to depth is the book you’re currently reading—most of which was\nwritten during this period. Writing a seventy-thousand-word book manuscript, of\ncourse, placed a sudden new constraint on my already busy schedule, and I wanted to\nmake sure my academic productivity didn’t take a corresponding hit. Another reason I\nturned back to depth was the looming tenure process. I had a year or two of\npublications left before my tenure case was submitted. \nThis\n was the time, in other\nwords, to make a statement about my abilities (especially given that my wife and I\nwere planning on growing our family with a second child in the final year before\ntenure). The final reason I turned back to depth was more personal and (admittedly) a\ntouch petulant. I had applied and been rejected for a well-respected grant that many of\nmy colleagues were receiving. I was upset and embarrassed, so I decided that instead\nof just complaining or wallowing in self-doubt, I would compensate for losing the\ngrant by increasing the rate and impressiveness of my publications—allowing them to\ndeclare on my behalf that I actually \ndid\n know what I was doing, even if this one\nparticular grant application didn’t go my way.\nI was already an adept deep worker, but these three forces drove me to push this\nhabit to an extreme. I became ruthless in turning down time-consuming commitments\nand began to work more in isolated locations outside my office. I placed a tally of my\ndeep work hours in a prominent position near my desk and got upset when it failed to\ngrow at a fast enough \nrate. Perhaps most impactful, I returned to my MIT habit of\nworking on problems in my head whenever a good time presented itself—be it\nwalking the dog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I tended to increase my deep work\nonly as a deadline approached, this year I was relentless—most every day of most\nevery week I was pushing my mind to grapple with results of consequence, regardless\nof whether or not a specific deadline was near. I solved proofs on subway rides and\nwhile shoveling snow. When my son napped on the weekend, I would pace the yard\nthinking, and when stuck in traffic I would methodically work through problems that\n\f\nwere stymieing me.\nAs this year progressed, I became a deep work machine—and the result of this\ntransformation caught me off guard. During the same year that I wrote a book and my\noldest son entered the terrible twos, I managed to more than double my average\nacademic productivity, publishing \nnine\n peer-reviewed papers—all the while\nmaintaining my prohibition on work in the evenings.\nI’m the first to admit that my year of extreme depth was perhaps a bit too extreme: It\nproved cognitively exhausting, and going forward I’ll likely moderate this intensity.\nBut this experience reinforces the point that opened this conclusion: Deep work is \nway\nmore\n powerful than most people understand. It’s a commitment to this skill that\nallowed Bill Gates to make the most of an unexpected opportunity to create a new\nindustry, and that allowed me to double my academic productivity the same year I\ndecided to concurrently write a \nbook. To leave the distracted masses to join the\nfocused few, I’m arguing, is a transformative experience.\nThe deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic\nchanges to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid\ne-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you\nleave much of that behind. There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to\nproduce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the\npossibility that your best is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture\nthan to step into the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better.\nBut if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to\ndeploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll\ndiscover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity\nand meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the\nfocused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And\nhopefully now that you’ve finished this book, you agree too."

A small number of Twitter users have such a large following that the average\nskews high. Presumably the median would be much lower. But then again, both statistics include users who\nsigned up just to try out the service or read tweets, and who made no serious attempt to ever gain followers or\nwrite tweets.

The quote came from 9:55 into Chapter 6 of Part 2 in the unabridged\nAudible.com audio version of the book.\nThe details of the Bill Gates story came mainly from Isaacson, “Dawn of a Revolution,” article, which Walter\nIsaacson excerpted (with modification) from his \nInnovators\n. I also pulled some background details, however,\nfrom Stephen Manes’s excellent 1994 business biography. Manes, Stephen. \nGates: How Microsoft’s Mogul\nReinvented an Industry—and Made Himself the Richest Man in America\n. New York: Doubleday, 1992.\nNewport, Cal. \nSo Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skill Trumps Passion in the Quest for Work You Love\n.\nNew York: Business Plus, 2012.\nYou can find a list of my computer science publications, organized by year, at my academic website:\nhttp://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~cnewport. The publications from my year of living deeply are listed under\n2014. Notice that theoretical computer scientists, like myself, publish mainly in competitive conferences, not\njournals, and that we tend to list authors alphabetically, not in order of contribution.\n“I’ll live the focused life”\n: from page 14 of Gallagher, \nRapt\n.\n\f\n*\n The complex reality of the technologies that real companies leverage to get ahead emphasizes the absurdity of the\nnow common idea that exposure to simplistic, consumer-facing products—especially in schools—somehow prepares\npeople to succeed in a high-tech economy. Giving students iPads or allowing them to film homework assignments on\nYouTube prepares them for a high-tech economy about as much as playing with Hot Wheels would prepare them to\nthrive as auto mechanics.\n\f\n*\n After Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea of deliberate practice in his 2008 bestseller, \nOutliers: The Story of\nSuccess\n, it became fashionable within psychology circles (a group suspicious, generally speaking, of all things\nGladwellian) to poke holes in the deliberate practice hypothesis. For the most part, however, these studies did not\ninvalidate the necessity of deliberate practice, but instead attempted to identify other components also playing a role\nin expert performance. In a 2013 journal article, titled “Why Expert Performance Is Special and Cannot Be\nExtrapolated from Studies of Performance in the General Population: A Response to Criticisms,” and published in\nthe journal \nIntelligence\n 45 (2014): 81–103, Ericsson pushed back on many of these studies. In this article, Ericsson\nargues, among other things, that the experimental designs of these critical papers are often flawed because they\nassume you can extrapolate the difference between average and above average in a given field to the difference\nbetween expert and non-expert.\n\f\n*\n In the United States, there are three ranks of professors: assistant, associate, and full. You’re typically hired as an\nassistant professor and promoted to associate professor when you receive tenure. Full professorship is something\nthat usually requires many years to achieve after tenure, if you achieve it at all.\n\f\n*\n Lexical decision games flash strings of letters on the screen; some form real words, and some do not. The player\nhas to decide as quickly as possible if the word is real or not, pressing one key to indicate “real” and another to\nindicate “not real.” These tests allow you to quantify how much certain keywords are “activated” in the player’s\nmind, because more activation leads the player to hit the “real word” quicker when they see it flash on the screen.\n\f\n*\n In Part 2, I go into more detail about why this claim is not necessarily true.\n\f\n*\n I’m being somewhat loose in my use of the word “individualized” here. The monastic philosophy does not apply\nonly\n to those who work by themselves. There are examples of deep endeavors where the work is done among a\nsmall group. Think, for example, of songwriting teams like Rodgers and Hammerstein, or invention teams like the\nWright brothers. What I really mean to indicate with my use of the term is that this philosophy applies well to those\nwho can work toward clear goals without the other obligations that come along with being a member of a larger\norganization.\n\f\n*\n Supporters of open office plans might claim that they’re approximating this mix of depth and interaction by making\navailable conference rooms that people can use as needed to dive deeper into an idea. This conceit, however,\ntrivializes the role of deep work in innovation. These efforts are not an occasional accompaniment to inspirational\nchance encounters; they instead represent the bulk of the effort involved in most real breakthroughs.\n\f\n*\n You can see a snapshot of my “hour tally” online: “Deep Habits: Should You Track Hours or Milestones?” March\n23, 2014, http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/03/23/deep-habits-should-you-track-hours-or-milestones/.\n\f\n*\n There is some debate in the literature as to whether these are the exact same quantity. For our purposes, however,\nthis doesn’t matter. The key observation is that there is a limited resource, necessary to attention, that must be\nconserved.\n\f\n*\n The specific article by White from which I draw the steps presented here can be found online: Ron White, “How\nto Memorize a Deck of Cards with Superhuman Speed,” guest post, \nThe Art of Manliness\n, June 1, 2012,\nhttp://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/06/01/how-to-memorize-a-deck-of-cards/.\n\f\n*\n Notice, the \nInternet sabbatical\n is not the same as the \nInternet Sabbath\n mentioned in Rule #2. The latter asks\nthat you regularly take small breaks from the Internet (usually a single weekend day), while the former describes a\nsubstantial and long break from an online life, lasting many weeks—and sometimes more.\n\f\n*\n It was exactly this type of analysis that supports my own lack of presence on Facebook. I’ve never been a\nmember and I’ve undoubtedly missed out on many minor benefits of the type summarized above, but this hasn’t\naffected my quest to maintain a thriving and rewarding social life to any noticeable degree.\n\f\n*\n This idea has many different forms and names, including the 80/20 rule, Pareto’s principle, and, if you’re feeling\nparticularly pretentious, the principle of factor sparsity.\n\f\n*\n The studies I cite are looking at the activity of deliberate practice—which substantially (but not completely)\noverlaps our definition of deep work. For our purposes here, deliberate practice is a good specific stand.in for the\ngeneral category of cognitively demanding tasks to which deep work belongs.\n\f\nThank you for buying this ebook, published by Hachette Digital.\nTo receive special offers, bonus content, and news about our latest ebooks and apps,\nsign up for our newsletters.\nSign Up\nOr visit us at \nhachettebookgroup.com/newsletters"
