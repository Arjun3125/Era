    "raw_text": "Foreword\nla  The Technological Society, Jacques Ellul formulates a compre­\nhensive and forceful social philosophy of our technical civilization. \nLess penetrating than Thorstein Veblen’s The Engineers and the \nPrice System, it nevertheless widens the scope of inquiry into the \nconsequences of having a society pervaded by technicians. Ellul’s \nbook is more colorful and incisive than Oswald Spengler’s Man and \nTechnics— which by contrast seems faded and unperceptive— and \nit is more analytical than Lewis Mumford’s trilogy— although Ellul \nhandles the historical evidence much more sparingly and with less \nassurance than Mumford. And it is more far-ranging and system­\natic than Siegfried Giedion’s Mechanization Takes Command, \nwhich, of all the books overlapping Ellul’s subject, comes close to \ngiving the reader a sense of what the dominance of technique \nmight mean for the present and the future of man. In short, what­\never its occasional deficiencies, The Technological Society requires \nus to examine anew what the author describes as the essential \ntragedy of a civilization increasingly dominated by technique.\nDespite Ellul’s forceful emphasis upon the erosion of moral \nvalues brought about by technicism, he has written neither a latter- \nday Luddite tract nor a sociological apocalypse. He shows that he \nis thoroughly familiar with the cant perpetuated by technophobes\n\f\nVi)\nand for the most part manages to avoid their cliches. Indeed, he \ntakes these apart with masterly skill to show them for the empty \nassertions they typically are. Neither does he merely substitute a \nhigh moral tone or noisy complaints for tough-minded analysis. \nHis contribution is far more substantial. He examines the role of \ntechnique in modem society and offers a system of thought that, \nwith some critical modification, can help us understand the forces \nbehind the development of the technical civilization that is \ndistinctively ours.\nEnough of Ellul’s idiosyncratic vocabulary has survived the \nhazards of transoceanic migration to require us to note the special \nmeanings he assigns to basic terms. By technique, for example, he \nmeans far more than machine technology. Technique refers to any \ncomplex of standardized means for attaining a predetermined \nresult. Thus, it converts spontaneous and unreflective behavior into \nbehavior that is deliberate and rationalized. The Technical Man is \nfascinated by results, by the immediate consequences of setting \nstandardized devices into motion. He cannot help admiring the \nspectacular effectiveness of nuclear weapons of war. Above all, he \nis committed to the never-ending search for \"the one best way” to \nachieve any designated objective.\nOurs is a progressively technical civilization: by this Ellul means \nthat the ever-expanding and irreversible rule of technique is ex­\ntended to all domains of life. It is a civilization committed to the \nquest for continually improved means to carelessly examined ends. \nIndeed, technique transforms ends into means. What was once \nprized in its own right now becomes worthwhile only if it helps \nachieve something else. And, conversely, technique turns means \ninto ends. “Know how” takes on an ultimate value.\nThe vital influence of technique is of course most evident in the \neconomy. It produces a growing concentration of capital (as was \npresciently observed by Marx). Vast concentrations of capital re­\nquire increasing control by the state. Once largely confined within \nthe business firm, planning now becomes the order of the day for \nthe economy as a whole. The dominance of technique imposes \ncentralism upon the economy ( despite comparatively inconsequen­\ntial efforts to decentralize individual industrial firms), for once \ntechnique develops beyond a given degree, there is no effective"

But this inevitable process is impersonal.\nOnly the naive can really believe that the world-wide movement \ntoward centralism results from the machinations of evil statesmen.\nThe intellectual discipline of economics itself becomes techni- \ncized. Technical economic analysis is substituted for the older po­\nlitical economy included in which was a major concern with the \nmoral structure of economic activity. Thus doctrine is converted \ninto procedure. In this sphere as in others, the technicians form a \nclosed fraternity with their own esoteric vocabulary. Moreover, \nthey are concerned only with what is, as distinct from what ought \nto be.\nPolitics in turn becomes an arena for contention among rival \ntechniques. The technician sees the nation quite differently from \nthe political man: to the technician, the nation is nothing more \nthan another sphere in which to apply the instruments he has de­\nveloped. To him, the state is not the expression of the will of the \npeople nor a divine creation nor a creature of class conflict. It is an \nenterprise providing services that must be made to function effi­\nciently. He judges states in terms of their capacity to utilize tech­\nniques effectively, not in terms of their relative justice. Political \ndoctrine revolves around what is useful rather than what is good. \nPurposes drop out of sight and efficiency becomes the central con­\ncern. As the political form best suited to the massive and un­\nprincipled use of technique, dictatorship gains in power. And this \nin turn narrows the range of choice for the democracies: either they \ntoo use some version of effective technique— centralized control \nand propaganda— or they will fall behind.\nRestraints on the rule of technique become increasingly tenuous. \nPublic opinion provides no control because it too is largely oriented \ntoward “performance” and technique is regarded as the prime in­\nstrument of performance, whether in the economy or in politics, in \nart or in sports.\nNot understanding what the rule of technique is doing to him \nand to his world, modem man is beset by anxiety and a feeling of \ninsecurity. He tries to adapt to changes he cannot comprehend. \nThe conflict of propaganda takes the place of the debate of ideas. \nTechnique smothers the ideas that put its rule in question and filters \nout for public discussion Only those ideas that are in substantial\n\f\nvlii)\naccord with the values created by a technical civilization. Social \ncriticism is negated because there is only slight access to the techni­\ncal means required to reach large numbers of people.\nIn Ellul’s conception, then, life is not happy in a civilization domi­\nnated by technique. Even the outward show of happiness is bought \nat the price of total acquiescence. The technological society requires \nmen to be content with what they are required to like; for those \nwho are not content, it provides distractions— escape into absorp­\ntion with technically dominated media of popular culture and \ncommunication. And the process is a natural one: every part of a \ntechnical civilization responds to the social needs generated by \ntechnique itself. Progress then consists in progressive de-humani­\nzation— a busy, pointless, and, in the end, suicidal submission to \ntechnique.\nThe essential point, according to Ellul, is that technique pro­\nduces all this without plan; no one wills it or arranges that it be so. \nOur technical civilization does not result from a Machiavellian \nscheme. It is a response to the \"laws of development\" of technique.\nIn proposing and expanding this thesis, Ellul reopens the great \ndebate over the social, political, economic, and philosophical mean­\ning of technique in the modem age. We need not agree with Ellul \nto learn from him. He has given us a provocative book, in the \nsense that he has provoked us to re-examine our assumptions and \nto search out the flaws in his own gloomy forecasts. By doing so, \nhe helps us to see beyond the banal assertion that ours has become \na mass society, and he leads us to a greater understanding of that \nsociety.\nRobert K. Merton\nColumbia University \nJanuary 1964"

    "raw_text": "Translator's Introduction\nJacques EUul\nas the Philosopher of the Technological Society\nErnst Jiinger once wrote that technology is the real metaphysics of \nthe twentieth century. The irreversible collectivist tendencies of \ntechnology, whether it calls itself democratic or authoritarian, were \nalready apparent to him, at the end of World War I. It is this so­\nciety, in all its forms, which Jacques Ellul, of the Faculty of Law \nof Bordeaux, seeks to analyze.\nProfessor Ellul, unlike most of the other surviving leaders of the \nFrench Resistance, still functions as a voice of conscience for a \nFrance which seems to feel itself in danger of being overwhelmed \nfrom literally every point of the compass by the materialistic values \nof the cold war— consumer society. Greater influence is enjoyed \nby others such as Malraux and Sartre; but Malraux is in the service \nof the welfare state (albeit one with Gallic flourishes) and Sartre \nis growing rich by dispensing absinthe morality in the cellars of \nthe Left Bank. “I sometimes wonder,\" says Ellul in a related con­\nnection, 'about the revolutionary value of acts accompanied by \nsuch a merry jingle of the cash register.\"\n\f\n* )\nEllul’s principal work, this book, appeared under the title La \nTechnique and the subtitle L'enjeu du siicle, The subtitle, which \nmeans literally \"the stake of the century,” is a characteristically dark \nand difficult Ellulian phrase which may or may not refer to a kind \nof \"Pascal wager” put on technology by twentieth-century man. \nThe Technique of the title, however, lends itself more easily to in­\nterpretation, although, characteristically, it too is used in a sense \nit does not usually enjoy. Technique, the reader discovers more or \nless quickly, must be distinguished from the several techniques \nwhich are its elements. It is more even than a generalized mechani­\ncal technique; it is, in fact, nothing less than the organized ensemble \nof all individual techniques which have been used to secure any \nend whatsoever. Harold Lasswell’s definition comes closest to \nEllul’s conception: “The ensemble of practices by which one uses \navailable resources to achieve values.” This definition has the merit \nof emphasizing the scope of technique; but Ellul’s further account \nmakes it clear that it does not go far enough, since technique has \nbecome indifferent to all the traditional human ends and values by \nbecoming an end-in-itself. Our erstwhile means have all become an \nend, an end, furthermore, which has nothing human in it and to \nwhich we must accommodate ourselves as best we may. We cannot \neven any longer pretend to act as though the ends justified the \nmeans, which would still be recognizably human, if not particularly \nvirtuous. Technique, as the universal and autonomous technical \nfact, is revealed as the technological society itself in which man is \nbut a single tightly integrated and articulated component. The \nTechnological Society is a description of the way in which an \nautonomous technology is in process of taking over the traditional \nvalues of every society witliCut exception, subvcitmg and sup~ \npressing these values to produce at last a monolithic world culture \nin which all nontechnological difference and variety is mere ap­\npearance.\nThe technical malaise so deeply felt in non-Communist Europe \nat the imminent takeover has brought forth in recent years an as­\ntonishingly large number of literary, philosophic, and sociological \nanalyses of the technical phenomenon. One of the great merits of \nEllul’s book arises from the fact that he alone has pushed such \nanalysis to the limit in all spheres of human activity and in the \ntotality of their interrelatedness. It may be added that what some\n\f\nTranslator's Introduction(xi\nauthors feel to be the book’s demerits arise from the same source; \nthey maintain that society more often than not refuses to be pushed \nto that reductio ad absurdum which is the inevitable end point of \nevery thoroughgoing analysis. The books of such authors generally \nend on a note of optimism. A final chapter always asks: \"What is to \nbe done?” Unfortunately, their answers to the question are either \ninefficacious myths which confront reality with slogans, or only too \nefficacious technical solutions to technical problems which end \nonly in subjecting man the more thoroughly to technology. The \nformer are exemplified by most modem religions, philosophical \nsystems, and political doctrines; the latter by schemes for mass \neducation or mass cultivation of leisure, which, in Ellul’s analysis, \nare themselves highly impersonal and technicized structures Hav­\ning much more in common with the assembly line than with what \nmankind has traditionally designated by these names.\nThe technological malaise seems to Have been much less acutely \nfelt in the United States. Individuals such as Aldous Huxley, Paul \nTillich, and Erich Fromm, who have raised their voices in protest, \nare of European origin and received their education in Europe. \nTechnolaters such as Professors B. F. Skinner of Harvard and most \nother American professors represent the familiar type of the Ameri­\ncan intellectual caught in an ecstatic technical vertigo and seldom \nproceeding beyond certain vague meditations on isolated problem \nareas such as the “population explosion,” if indeed he considers \nthe real problems posed by technology at all. Ellul holds the Ameri­\ncans to be the most conformist people in the world, but in fairness \nit must be objected that, in his own analysis, the Soviets seem \nbetter to deserve this dubious honor since they have made even \npolitics into a technique. The Americans, apart from technicizing \nthe electoral process, have left at least the sphere of politics to the \noperations of amateurish bunglers and have thereby preserved a \nmodicum of humanity. It may be added that France, too, has been \ntaken into the technological orbit with a speed which must have \nastonished Ellul. De Gaulle’s plans for his new France contem­\nplate the complete technicization of French society in nine years \ninstead of the quarter century of grace which Ellul predicts in his \nbook.\nSince the religious object is that which is uncritically wor­\nshipped, technology tends more and more to become the new god.\n\f\nxtt)\nThis is true for all modern societies, but especially so for Com­\nmunist societies, since Marxism, in Ellul’s analysis of it, consciously \nidentifies the material infrastructure, upon which the social super­\nstructure is raised, with technology.* The expression of technologi­\ncal malaise in the Soviet Union or in Red China, where technolatry \nhas become the new Establishment, would be blasphemy in the \nstrictest sense of the word.\nIn composition and style, Ellul’s book is certain to be an enigma, \nand even a scandal, to many. It is not sociology, political economy, \nhistory, or any other academic discipline, at least as these terms are \nusually understood. It will not even appear to be philosophy to a \ngeneration whose philosophic preoccupations are almost exclu­\nsively analytic. Ellul himself is in doubt about the value of the \ndesignation philosopher. But, if we think back to the dialectical \nphilosophies of the whole of thinkers such as Plato and Hegel, \nEllul's book is philosophy. If an American specialist, say, in eco­\nnomics, with his ’’terribly linear” logic and his apparently un­\nshakable conviction that his arbitrarily delimited systems can and \nshould be studied in isolation from all others, were to flip open \nEllul’s book to those sections which treat of matters economic, it is \nconceivable that he would be repelled by what he found. But if this \nsame specialist could somehow or other implausibly be persuaded \nto persevere in the attempt to see with Ellul economics in the light \nof the whole of modem technical culture, it is likewise conceivable \nthat he would gain important insights, not perhaps into the fine- \nstructure of academic economic problems, but in the border region \nwhere his subject abuts on other disciplines, in that area where \nbasic discoveries in economics (and everything else) are always \nmade by gifted amateurs, who faute de mieux must be called \nphilosophers.\nEllul’s admittedly difficult style is not to be referred to that \nstyle heurte affected by so many postwar French existentialists. \nAn element of this is doubtless present, but it would be much more \naccurate to say that, in an essentially dramatic work such as the \npresent book must be deemed to be, the transitions and turns of \nthought must have a character entirely different from those to be\n1 Ellul once again showed much prescience. Marxist publications of the last few \nyears have come to speak of the '‘technical-material infrastructure* instead of the \n^material infrastructure.*\n\f\nTranslator^s Introduction(xiii\nencountered in the ultra-respectable academic texts which have \ntaken over from mathematics certain linear and deductive modes \nof presentation; modes, which, whatever their pedagogic value may \nbe, serve, even in mathematics, only to obscure the way in which \ntruth comes into being. To its dramatic presentation of what are, \nafter all, well-known facts, Ellul’s book owes its high persuasive \nquality.\nThis dramatic character would have been clearly evident if the \nbook had been written as a dialogue. Indeed, a reader could easily \ncast it into this form by representing to himself the various thinkers \nwho are introduced by name as the dramatis personae, and by \ntreating the nameless “On the one hands” and \"On the other \nhands” in the same way. In this way the \"successive recantations” \nof some positions and the development of others in the light of a \nguiding concept of the whole become clear, and the book’s essen­\ntial affinity to a Platonic dialogue like the Republic is evident. (No­\nwhere is this successive recantation more evident than in the \nfirst chapter’s search for definitions.) Even clearer is the similarity \nof the book to Hegel’s Phanomenologie des Geistes, the last work of \nWestern philosophy with which, in the translator’s opinion, the \npresent work bears comparison. The Technological Society is not a \n“phenomenology of mind” but rather a \"phenomenology of the \ntechnical state of mind.” Like Hegel’s book, it is intensely his­\ntrionic; and like it, it shows, without offering causal mechanisms, \nhow its subject in its lowest stage (technique as machine tech­\nnique) develops dialectically through the various higher stages \nto become at last the fully evolved phenomenon (the technical \nphenomenon identical with the technical society). Again, as with \nHegel, what the philosopher J. Loewenberg has called the “his­\ntrionic irony” of statement must drive the literal-minded reader \nmad.\nThe Danish historian of philosophy, Harald Hoeffding, says of \nHegel’s Phenomenology:\nThe course of development described in this unique work is at \nonce that of the individual and of the race; it gives at the same \ntime a psychology and a history of culture— and in the exposition \nthe two are so interwoven that it is often impossible to tell which of \nthe two is intended."

Yet, in another sense, and especially for a translator, it is impera­tive to do so. Although, after the time of Descartes, French savants in general were preoccupied with clarifying problems of method, it has been almost impossible in the twentieth century to extort from French writers on sociology and economics an adequate ac­count of their procedures. Some of them have doubtless been over­sensitive to Poincare s famous jibe concerning the sciences “with the most methods and the fewest results.” In Ellul’s case, however, disinclination to discuss methodology specifically is almost cer­tainly due in large part to his pervasive distrust of anything at all resembling a fixed doctrine. Nevertheless, throughout the book are scattered a large number of references to method, and it is possible and necessary to reconstruct from them a satisfactory account of the author’s methodology.Ellul first “situates” the “facts” of experience in a general context, and then proceeds to “focus” them.

    "raw_text": "Translators Introduction(xv\nfor a moment unaware where the authors own sympathies lie. \nNonetheless, on balance, it seems clear that he has not allowed his \nown value judgments to intrude in any illegitimate way on ques­\ntions of fact. “Fact” is very important to Ellul, but only as ex­\nperienced in the context of the whole. Facts as they figure in un­\ninterpreted statistical analyses of a given domain, or as they may \nbe revealed by opinion polls and in newspapers, are anathema to \nhim; and he permits himself many diatribes against this kind of \n“abstract,” disembodied fact which is so dear to the hearts of \nAmericans, at least as Ellul imagines them to be. With this proviso, \nEllul can echo the dictum of Hegel’s Phenomenology that the only \nimaginable point of departure of philosophy is experience.\nThe insistence on rendering a purely phenomenological account \nof fact, without causal explanation of the interrelation of the sub­\nordinate facts, may seem distasteful to some readers. Since Aristotle \nit has been a common conception of science that we have knowl­\nedge only when we know the Why. Admittedly, whenever causal \nknowledge is available, it is indeed valuable. But it ought not to be \nforgotten that such knowledge is increasingly hard to come by, and, \nin fact, hardly makes its appearance at all in modem physics, say, \nwhere one must, for the most part, be content with purely func­\ntional (that is, phenomenological) equations, which dispense with \nany appeal to mechanism but which are nonetheless adequate for \nprediction and explanation, and which have the enormous addi­\ntional advantage of containing no hidden concepts unconfront- \nable by experience. The important questions concerning the techno­\nlogical society rarely turn for Ellul on how or why things came to \nbe so, but rather on whether his description of them is a true one.\nEllul’s methodology is fundamentally dominated by the prin­\nciple which has come to be called Engel’s law, that is, the law \nasserting the passage of quantity into quality. To give a common­\nplace example, the city, after it reaches a certain threshold of \npopulation, is supposed to pass over into a qualitatively different \ntype of urban organization. Unfortunately, both the popular and \nthe usual philosophical accounts of Engel’s law are incomplete, to \nuse no worse word.\nFirst, it is incorrect to speak at all of a “threshold” of quantity \nwhich, having been transcended, gives rise to a change of quality \nand to a new set of laws and explanatory principles. In dialectical\n\f\n*»<)\nlogic, every change of quantity is simultaneously a change of \nquality; and the discernment of a 'threshold'* quantity is partly a \npsychological fact of awareness, and partly an illicit attempt to try \nto import back into a dialectical logic some of the unequivocalness \nof the ordinary either/or logic. Now, Ellul's explanation of the \ntechnical takeover is based fundamentally on the fact that the ma­\nterial (that is, technical) substratum of human existence, which \nwas traditionally not allowed to be a legitimate end of human ac­\ntion, has become so “enormous,” so “immense,\" that men are no \nlonger able to cope with it as means, so that it has become an \nend-in-itself, to which men must adapt themselves. But, with a \nbetter understanding of the illusory nature of the “threshold quan­\ntity,\" we are able to turn aside the objections which are always \nraised by those who rightly but extraneously urge that historical \nsocieties have always had to struggle with the possibility of a ma­\nterial takeover and that the present state of affairs is therefore not \nsomething new. The answer, of course, is that the objection is ir­\nrelevant. Ellul could not mean to assert that men in the past have \nnot had to contend with material means which threatened to ex­\nceed their capacity to make good use of them, but that men in the \npast were not confronted with technical means of production and \norganization which in their sheer numerical proliferation and ve­\nlocity unavoidably surpassed man’s relatively unchanging biologi­\ncal and spiritual capacities to exploit them as means to human \nends.\nSecond, Engel’s law must never be taken to imply a one-way \ntransition of quantity into quality. In dialectical logic the trans­\nformation of quality into quantity is a necessary concomitant \nof the reversible tn*ns£orm?.Hoii into nnalitv. It is in\nfact, the essence of technique to compel the qualitative to become \nquantitative, and in this way to force every stage of human activity \nand man himself to submit to its mathematical calculations. Ellul \ngives examples of this at every level. Thus, technique forces all \nsociological phenomena to submit to the clock, for Ellul the most \ncharacteristic of all modem technical instruments. The substitution \nof the tempos mortuum of the mechanical clock for the biological \nand psychological time “natural” to man is in itself sufficient to \nsuppress all the traditional rhythms of human life in favor of the \nmechanical. Again, genuine human communities are suppressed by\n\f\nTranslators Introduction(xoii\nthe technological society to form collectivities of 'mass men* in* \ncapable of obeying any other law than the statistical \"law of large \nnumbers.* All the technical devices of education, propaganda, \namusement, sport, and religion are mobilized to persuade the hu­\nman being to be satisfied with his condition of mechanical, mind­\nless \"mass man,* and ruthlessly to exterminate the deviant and the \nidiosyncratic.\nThe reduction of everything to quantity is partly a cause, and \npartly an effect, of the modem omnipresence of computing ma­\nchines and cybernated factories.\nIt should not be imagined, however, that the universal concentra­\ntion camp which Ellul thinks is coming into being in all technical \nsocieties without exception will be felt as harsh or restrictive by its \ninmates. Hitler’s concentration camps of hobnailed boots were \nsymptoms of a deficient political technique. The denizen of the \ntechnological state of the future will have everything his heart ever \ndesired, except, of course, his freedom. Admittedly, modem man, \nforced by technique to become in reality and without residue the \nimaginary producer-consumer of the classical economists, shows \ndisconcertingly little regard for his lost freedom; but, according to \nEllul, there are ominous signs that human spontaneity, which in \nthe rational and ordered technical society has no expression except \nmadness, is only too capable of outbreaks of irrational suicidal de­\nstructiveness.\nThe escape valves of modem literature and art, which technique \nhas contrived, may or may not turn out to be adequate to the harm­\nless release of the pent-up “ecstatic” energies of the human bang. \nTechnique, which can in principle only oppose technical and quan­\ntitative solutions to technical problems, must, in such a case, seek \nout other technical safety valves. It could, for example, convince \nmen that they were happy and contented by means of drugs, even \nthough they were visibly suffering from the worst kind of spiritual \nand material privation. It is obvious that off such ultimate technical \nmeasures must cause the last meager “idealistic* motifs of the whole \ntechnical enterprise to disappear. Ellul does not specifically say \nso, but it seems that he must hold that the technological society, \nlike everything else, bears within itself the seeds of its own destruc­\ntion.\nIt must not be imagined that the autonomous technique en-\n\f\nxviii)\nvisioned by Ellul is a kind of \"technological determinism,” to use a \nphrase of Veblen. It may sometimes seem so, but only because all \nhuman institutions, like the motions of all physical bodies, have a \ncertain permanence, or vis inertiae, which makes it highly probable \nthat the near future of statistical aggregations will see them con­\ntinue more or less in the path of the immediate past. Things could \nhave eventuated in the technological society otherwise than as they \nhave.\nTechnique, to Ellul, is a “blind\" force, but one which unfortu­\nnately seems to be more perspicacious than the best discernible \nhuman intelligences. There are other ways out, Ellul maintains, but \nnobody wants any part of them.\nEllul’s insistence that the technical phenomenon is not a de­\nterminism is not weakened by the enumeration (in the second \nchapter) of five conditions which are said to be “necessary and \nsufficient” for its outburst in the recent past, since the sufficient con­\nditions for the conditions (for example, the causes of the popula­\ntion explosion) are not ascertainable.\nThe inertia of the technical phenomenon guarantees not only the \ncontinued refinement and production of relatively beneficial arti­\ncles such as flush toilets and wonder drugs, but also the emergence \nof those unpredictable secondary effects which are always the re­\nsult of ecological meddling and which today are of such magnitude \nand acceleration that they can scarcely be reconciled with even \nsemistable equilibrium conditions of society. Nuclear explosions \nand population explosions capture the public’s imagination; but I \nhave argued that Ellul’s analysis demands that all indices of mod­\nem technological culture are exploding, too, and are potentially \njusi as dangerous to the cuuuiiucd wcii-bcing of society, if by well­\nbeing we understand social equilibrium.\nReference to the vis inertiae of technique should not obscure the \nfact that technique has become the only fully spontaneous activity \nof the modem world. Art and science are mentioned as other hu­\nman activities by Ellul. But art, though it is concrete, is subjective; \nand science, though objective in its description of reality, is ab­\nstract. Only technique is at once both concrete and objective in \nthat it creates the reality it describes. Ellul must conclude that \nfrom among the data of science technique legislates those which it \ndeems most efficient and rejects the rest Economic and social\n\f\nTranslator’s Introduction ( xix\n\"model builders,” those assiduous technocratic apes, may seek to \nsoften the violence of this description by pointing out that all \nsciences “specify a universe of discourse.” It remains unfortunately \ntrue, however, that such “specification” proceeds by way of elimina­\ntion of the human;\nEllul is no machinoclast like the partisans of the weak-minded \nLudd seeking to wreck the stocking frames. He has no doctrinal de­\nlusions at all, a fortiori none like those of Rousseau and certain of \nhis disciples, who imagined that man would be happy in a state \nof nature.\nIn view of the fact that Ellul continually apostrophizes technique \nas “unnatural” (except when he calls it the “new nature” ), it might \nbe thought surprising that he has no fixed conception of nature \nor of the natural. The best answer seems to be that he considers \n“natural” (in the good sense) any environment able to satisfy man's \nmaterial needs, if it leaves him free to use it as means to achieve \nhis individual, internally generated ends. The necessary and suffi­\ncient condition for this state of affairs is that man’s means should \nbe (qualitatively and quantitatively) “at the level” of man’s ca­\npacities. Under these dubiously realizable circumstances, Ellul \napparently thinks of techniques as so many blessings.\nSince men are unwilling to acknowledge their demotion to die \nstatus of joyous robots, and since they demand justification for their \nindividual and collective acts as never before in history, it is easy \nto understand why the modern intellectuals (and their forcing- \nhouse, the university) have become veritable machines for the in­\nvention of new myths and the propagation of old ones. It would \nbe easy to compile a list of all the things which Ellul must deem \n“myth.” Such a list would quite simply contain all philosophical, \nhistorical, religious, and political doctrines known to man, except \ninsofar as such doctrines have technological components. The \nWestern democracies, for example, are out after money and the \nEastern Communists are out after power; otherwise they share an \nidentical view of life, and the epiphenomenal variant ideologies \nwhich accompany identical acts can only be described as a cruel \nhoax.\nIt is disconcerting in the extreme to contemplate the possibility \nthat cherished democratic institutions have become empty forms \nwhich have no visible connection with the acts of democratic na"

The whole first chapter is devoted \nto making clear what constitutes technique in the present-day \nworld, but as a preliminary there must be a simple idea, a defini­\ntion.\nThe term technique, as I use it, does not mean machines, tech­\nnology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end. In our \ntechnological society, technique is the totality of methods rationally \narrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of de­\nvelopment ) in every field of human activity. Its characteristics are \nnew; the technique of the present has no common measure with \nthat of the past.\nThis definition is not a theoretical construct. It is arrived at by \nexamining each activity and observing the facts of what modern \nman calls technique in general, as well as by investigating the dif­\nferent areas in which specialists declare they have a technique.\nIn the course of this work, the word technique will be used with \nvarying emphasis on one or another aspect of this definition. At one \npoint, the emphasis may be on rationality, at another on efficiency \nor procedure, but the over-all definition will remain the same.\nFinally, we shall be looking at technique in its sociological aspect;\n\f\nxxoi)\nthat is, we shall consider the effect of technique on social relation­\nships, political structures, economic phenomena. Technique is not \nan isolated fact in society (as the term technology would lead us \nto believe) but is related to every factor in the life of modern man; \nit affects social facts as well as all others. Thus technique itself is a \nsociological phenomenon, and it is in this light that we shall study \nit.\nJune\nJacques Ellul\n\f\nAuthor s Foreword to the \nRevised American Edition\nAt the beginning I must try to make clear the direction and aim \nof this book. Although descriptive, it is not without purpose. I do \nnot limit myself to describing my findings with cold objectivity in \nthe manner qf a research worker reporting what he sees under a \nmicroscope. I am keenly aware that I am myself involved in \ntechnological civilization, and that its history is also my own. I may \nbe compared rather with a physician or physicist who is describing \na group situation in which he is himself involved. The physician \nin an epidemic, the physicist exposed to radioactivity: in such \nsituations the mind may remain cold and lucid, and the method \nobjective, but there is inevitably a profound tension of the whole \nbeing.\nAlthough I have deliberately not gone beyond description, the \nreader may perhaps receive an impression of pessimism. I am \nneither by nature, nor doctrinally, a pessimist, nor have I pessimis­\ntic prejudices. I am concerned only with knowing whether things \nare so or not. The reader tempted to brand me a pessimist should \nbegin to examine his own conscience, and ask himself what causes \nhim to make such a judgment. For behind this judgment, I believe, \nwill always be found previous metaphysical value judgments, such\n\f\nxxvHi')\nas: “Man is free”; \"Man is lord of creation”; “Man has always over­\ncome challenges” (so why not this one too?); “Man is good.” Or \nagain: “Progress is always positive”; “Man has an eternal soul, and \nso cannot be put in jeopardy.” Those who hold such convictions \nwill say that my description of technological civilization is in­\ncorrect and pessimistic. I ask only that the reader place himself on \nthe factual level and address himself to these questions: “Are the \nfacts analyzed here false?” “Is the analysis inaccurate?” “Are the \nconclusions unwarranted?\" “Are there substantial gaps and omis­\nsions?” It will not do for him to challenge factual analysis on \nthe basis of his own ethical or metaphysical presuppositions.\nThe reader deserves and has my assurance that I have not set out \nto prove anything. I do not seek to show, say, that man is deter­\nmined, or that technique is bad, or anything else of the kind.\nTwo other factors may lead the reader to the feeling of pessi­\nmism. It may be that he feels a rigorous determinism is here de­\nscribed that leaves no room for effective individual action, or that \nhe cannot find any solution for the problems raised in the book. \nThese two factors must now engage our attention.\nAs to the rigorous determinism, I should explain that I have tried \nto perform a work of sociological reflection, involving analysis of \nlarge groups of people and of major trends, but not of individual \nactions. I do not deny the existence of individual action or of some \ninner sphere of freedom. I merely hold that these are not discerni­\nble at the most general level of analysis, and that the individual’s \nacts or ideas do not here and now exert any influence on social, \npolitical, or economic mechanisms. By making this statement, I \nexplicitly take a partisan position in a dispute between schools of \nsociology. To me the sociological does not consist of the addition \nand combination of individual actions. I believe that there is a col­\nlective sociological reality, which is independent of the individual. \nAs I see it, individual decisions are always made within the frame­\nwork of this sociological reality, itself pre-existent and more or less \ndeterminative. I have simply endeavored to describe technique as \na sociological reality. We are dealing with collective mechanisms, \nwith relationships among collective movements, and with modifi­\ncations of political or economic structures. It should not be sur­\nprising, therefore, that no reference is made to the separate, inde-\n\f\nAuthors Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxix\npendent initiative o f individuals. It is not possible for me to treat \nthe individual sphere. But I do not deny that it exists. I do not \nmaintain that the individual is more determined today than he has \nbeen in the past; rather, that he is differently determined. Primi­\ntive man, hemmed in by prohibitions, taboos, and rites, was, of \ncourse, socially determined. But it is an illusion— unfortunately \nvery widespread— to think that because we have broken through \nthe prohibitions, taboos, and rites that bound primitive man, we \nhave become free. We are conditioned by something new: techno­\nlogical civilization. I make no reference to a past period of history \nin which men were allegedly free, happy, and independent. The \ndeterminisms of the past no longer concern us; they are finished \nand done with. If I do refer to the past, it is only to emphasize that \npresent determinants did not exist in the past, and men did not \nhave to grapple with them then. The men of classical antiquity \ncould not have found a solution to our present determinisms, and it \nis useless to look into the works of Plato or Aristotle for an answer \nto the problem of freedom.\nKeeping in mind that sociological mechanisms are always sig­\nnificant determinants— of more or less significance— for the indi­\nvidual, I would maintain that we have moved from one set of \ndeterminants to another. The pressure of these mechanisms is \ntoday very great; they operate in increasingly wide areas and pene­\ntrate more and more deeply into human existence. Therein lies the \nspecifically modern problem.\nThis determinism has, however, another aspect. There will be a  \ntemptation to use the word fatalism in connection with the phe­\nnomena described in this book. The reader may be inclined to say \nthat, if everything happens as stated in the book, man is entirely \nhelpless— helpless either to preserve his personal freedom or to \nchange the course of events. Once again, I think the question is \nbadly put. I would reverse the terms and say: if man— if each one \nof us— abdicates his responsibilities with regard to values; if each \nof us limits himself to leading a  trivial existence in a  technological \ncivilization, with greater adaptation and increasing success as his \nsole objectives; if we do not even consider the possibility of making \na  stand against these determinants, then everything will happen as \nI have described it, and the determinants teiU  be transformed into \ninevitabilities. But, in describing sociological currents, I obviously\n\f\nXXX )\ncannot take into account the contingent decisions of this or that \nindividual, even if these decisions could modify the course of social \ndevelopment. For these decisions are not visible, and if they are \ntruly personal, they cannot be foreseen. I have tried to describe the \ntechnical phenomenon as it exists at present and to indicate its \nprobable evolution. Fatalism is not involved; it is rather a question \nof probability, and I have indicated what I think to be its most \nlikely development.\nWhat is the basis for this most likely eventuality? I would say \nthat it lies in social, economic, and political phenomena, and in \ncertain chains of events and sequences. If we may not speak of \nlaws, we may, at any rate, speak of repetitions. If we may not \nspeak of mechanisms in the strict sense of the word, we may speak \nof interdependencies. There is a certain logic (though not a formal \nlogic) in economic phenomena which makes certain forecasts pos­\nsible. This is true of sociology and, to a lesser degree, of politics. \nThere is a certain logic in the evolution of institutions which is \neasily discernible. It is possible, without resorting to imagination \nor science fiction, to describe the path that a social body or institu­\ntional complex will follow. An extrapolation is perfectly proper \nand scientific when it is made with care. Such an extrapolation is \nwhat we have attempted. But it never represents more than a \nprobability, and may be proved false by events.\nExternal factors could change the course of history. The probable \ndevelopment I describe might be forestalled by the emergence of \nnew phenomena. I give three examples— widely different, and de­\nliberately so— of possible disturbing phenomena:\n1) If a general war breaks out, and if there are any survivors, \nthe destruction will be sc enormous, and the conditions of survival\nso different, that a technological society will no longer exist.\na) If an increasing number of people become fully aware of the \nthreat the technological world poses to man’s personal and spiritual \nlife, and if they determine to assert their freedom by upsetting the \ncourse of this evolution, my forecast will be invalidated.\n3) If God decides to intervene, man’s freedom may be saved by \na change in the direction of history or in the nature of man.\nBut in sociological analysis these possibilities cannot be con­\nsidered. The last two lie outside the field of sociology, and confront \nus with an upheaval so vast that its consequences cannot be as-\n\f\nAuthors Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxxi\nsessed. But sociological analysis does not permit consideration o( \nthese possibilities. In addition, the first two possibilities offer no \nanalyzable fact on which to base any attempt at projection. They \nhave no place in an inquiry into facts; I cannot deny that they may \noccur, but I cannot take them rationally into account. I am in the \nposition of a physician who must diagnose a disease and guess its \nprobable course, but who recognizes that God may work a miracle, \nthat the patient may have an unexpected constitutional reaction, or \nthat the patient— suffering from tuberculosis— may die unex­\npectedly of a heart attack. The reader must always keep in mind \nthe implicit presupposition that if man does not pull himself to­\ngether and assert himself (or if some other unpredictable but \ndecisive phenomenon does not intervene), then things will go the \nway I describe.\nThe reader may be pessimistic on yet another score. In this study \nno solution is put forward to the problems raised. Questions are \nasked, but not answered. I have indeed deliberately refrained \nfrom providing solutions. One reason is that the solutions would \nnecessarily be theoretical and abstract, since they are nowhere ap­\nparent in existing facts. I do not say that no solutions will be \nfound; I merely aver that in the present social situation there is \nnot even a beginning of a solution, no breach in the system of tech­\nnical necessity. Any solutions I might propose would be idealistic \nand fanciful. In a sense, it would even be dishonest to suggest solu­\ntions: the reader might think them real rather than merely literary. \nI am acquainted with the “solutions” offered by Emmanuel Mou­\nrner, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Ragnor Frisch, Jean Fourasti^, \nGeorges Friedmann, and others. Unfortunately, all these belong to \nthe realm of fancy and have no bearing on reality. I cannot ration­\nally consider them in analyzing the present situation.\nHowever, I will not make a final judgment on tomorrow before it \narrives. I do not presume to put chains around man. But I do \ninsist that a distinction be made between diagnosis and treat­\nment. Before a remedy can be found, it is first necessary to make a \ndetailed study of the disease and the patient, to do laboratory re­\nsearch, and to isolate the virus. It is necessary to establish criteria \nthat will make it possible to recognize the disease when it occurs, \nand to describe the patient’s symptoms at each stage of his illness.\n\f\nxxxii)\nThis preliminary work is indispensable for eventual discovery and \napplication of a remedy.\nBy this comparison I do not mean to suggest that technique is a \ndisease of the body social, but rather to indicate a working proce­\ndure. Technique presents man with multiple problems. As long as \nthe first stage of analysis is incomplete, as long as the problems are \nnot correctly stated, it is useless to proffer solutions. And, before \nwe can pose the problems correctly, we must have an exact descrip­\ntion of the phenomena involved. As far as I know, there is no \nover-all and exact description of the facts which would make it \npossible to formulate the problems correctly.\nThe existing works on the subject either are limited to a single \naspect of the problem— the effect of motion pictures on the nerv­\nous system, for example— or else propose solutions without the req­\nuisite preliminary study. I offer these pages as a first effort in lay­\ning the necessary ground; much more work will have to follow \nbefore we can see what man’s true response is to the challenge be­\nfore him.\nBut this must not lead the reader to say to himself: 'A ll right, \nhere is some information on the problem, and other sociologists, \neconomists, philosophers, and theologians will carry on the work, so \nI have simply got to w a it' This will not do, for the challenge is not \nto scholars and university professors, but to all of us. At stake is our \nvery life, and we shall need all the energy, inventiveness, imagina­\ntion, goodness, and strength we can muster to triumph in our pre­\ndicament While waiting for the specialists to get on with their \nwork on behalf of society, each of us, in his own life, must seek \nways of resisting and transcending technological determinants. \nEach man must make this effort in every area of life, in his profes­\nsion and in his social, religious, and family relationships.\nIn my conception, freedom is not an immutable fact graven in \nnature and on the heart of man. It is not inherent in man or in so­\nciety, and it is meaningless to write it into law. The mathematical, \nphysical, biological, sociological, and psychological sciences reveal \nnothing but necessities and determinisms on all sides. As a matter \nof fact, reality is itself a combination of determinisms, and freedom \nconsists in overcoming and transcending these determinisms. Free­\ndom is completely without meaning unless it is related to necessity, \nunless it represents victory over necessity. To say that freedom\n\f\nAuthor t Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxxiii\nis graven in the nature of man, is t o say that man is free because he \nobeys his nature, or, to put it another way, because he is condi­\ntioned by his nature. This is nonsense. We must not think of the \nproblem in terms of a choice between being determined and be­\ning free. We must look at it dialectically, and say that man is in­\ndeed determined, but that it is open to him to overcome necessity, \nand that this act is freedom. Freedom is not static but dynamic; \nnot a vested interest, but a prize continually to be won. Tie mo­\nment man stops and resigns himself, he becomes subject to deter­\nminism. He is most enslaved when he thinks he is comfortably \nsettled in freedom.\nIn the modem world, the most dangerous form of determinism \nis the technological phenomenon. It is not a question of getting rid \nof it, but, by an act of freedom, of transcending it How is this to \nbe done? I do not yet know. That is why this book is an appeal to \nthe individual’s sense of responsibility. The first step in th* quest, \nthe first act of freedom, is to become aware of the necessity. The \nvery fact that man can see, measure, and analyze the determinisms \nthat press on him means that he can face them and, by so doing, \nact as a free man. If man were to say \"These are not necessities; I \nam free because of technique, or despite technique,\" this would \nprove that he is totally determined. However, by grasping the real \nnature of the technological phenomenon, and the extent to which \nit is robbing him of freedom, he confronts the blind mechanisms as \na conscious being.\nAt the beginning of this foreword I stated that this book has a \npurpose. That purpose is to arouse the reader to an awareness of \ntechnological necessity and what it means. It is a call to the sleeper \nto awake.\nJacxjuxs Ellul\nL a Marierrr, Feuae, Gironde, France \nJanuary 1364"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER\nC O\nTECHNIQUES\nNo social, human, or spiritual fact is so important as the fact of tech­\nnique in the modem world. And yet no subject is so little under­\nstood. Let us try to set up some guideposts to situate the technical \nphenomenon.\nSituating the Technical Phenomenon\nMachines and Technique. Whenever we see the word technology \nor technique, we automatically think of machines. Indeed, we \ncommonly think of our world as a world of machines. This notion—  \nwhich is in fact an error— is found, for example, in the works of \nOldham and Pierre Ducassd. It arises from the fact that the ma­\nchine is the most obvious, massive, and impressive example of tech­\nnique, and historically the first What is called the history of tech­\nnique usually amounts to no more than a history of the machine; \nthis very formulation is an example of the habit of intellectuals of \nregarding forms of the present as identical with those of the past \nTechnique certainly began with the machine. It is quite true \nthat all the rest developed out of mechanics; it is quite true also that \nwithout the machine the world of technique would not exist But\n\f\n4 ) TECHNIQUES\nto explain the situation in this way does not at all legitimatize it. It \nis a mistake to continue with this confusion of terms, the more so \nbecause it leads to the idea that, because the machine is at the \norigin and center of the technical problem, one is dealing with the \nwhole problem when one deals with the machine. And that is a \ngreater mistake still. Technique has now become almost com­\npletely independent of the machine, which has lagged far behind \nits offspring.\nIt must be emphasized that, at present, technique is applied out­\nside industrial life. The growth of its power today has no relation \nto the growing use of the machine. The balance seems rather to \nhave shifted to the other side. It is the machine which is now en­\ntirely dependent upon technique, and the machine represents only \na small part of technique. If we were to characterize the relations \nbetween technique and the machine today, we could say not only \nthat the machine is the result of a certain technique, but also that \nits social and economic applications are made possible by other \ntechnical advances. The machine is now not even the most impor­\ntant aspect of technique (though it is perhaps the most spectac­\nular); technique has taken over all of man’s activities, not just his \nproductive activity.\nFrom another point of view, however, the machine is deeply \nsymptomatic: it represents the ideal toward which technique \nstrives. The machine is solely, exclusively, technique; it is pure \ntechnique, one might say. For, wherever a technical factor exists, it \nresults, almost inevitably, in mechanization: technique transforms \neverything it touches into a machine.\nAnother relationship exists between technique and the machine, \nand this relationship penetrates to the very core of the problem of \nour civilization. It is said (and everyone agrees) that the machine \nhas created an inhuman atmosphere. The machine, so characteris­\ntic of the nineteenth century, made an abrupt entrance into a soci­\nety which, from the political, institutional, and human points of \nview, was not made to receive it; and man has had to put up with it \nas best he can. Men now live in conditions that are less than human. \nConsider the concentration of our great cities, the slums, the lack \nof space, of air, of time, the gloomy streets and the sallow lights \nthat confuse night and day. Think of our dehumanized factories, \nour unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 5\nnature. Life in such an environment has no meaning. Consider our \npublic transportation, in which man is less important than a parcel; \nour hospitals, in which he is only a number. Yet we call this prog* \nress. . . . And the noise, that monster boring into us at every hour \nof the night without respite.\nIt is useless to rail against capitalism. Capitalism did not create \nour world; the machine did. Painstaking studies designed to prove \nthe contrary have buried the obvious beneath tons of print. And, \nif we do not wish to play the demagogue, we must point out the \nguilty party. “The machine is antisocial,” says Lewis Mumford. \"It \ntends, by reason of its progressive character, to the most acute \nforms of human exploitation.” The machine took its place in a social \nmilieu that was not made for it, and for that reason created the in­\nhuman society in which we live. Capitalism was therefore only one \naspect of the deep disorder of the nineteenth century. To restore \norder, it was necessary to question all the bases of that society—  \nits social and political structures, its art and its way of life, its com­\nmercial system.\nBut let the machine have its head, and it topples everything that \ncannot support its enormous weight. Thus everything had to be re­\nconsidered in terms of the machine. And that is precisely the role \ntechnique plays. In all fields it made an inventory of what it could \nuse, of everything that could be brought into line with the ma­\nchine. The machine could not integrate itself into nineteenth- \ncentury society; technique integrated it. Old houses that were not \nsuited to the workers were tom down; and the new world tech­\nnique required was built in their place. Technique has enough of \nthe mechanical in its nature to enable it to cope with the machine, \nbut it surpasses and transcends the machine because it remains in \nclose touch with the human order. The metal monster could not \ngo on forever torturing mankind. It found in technique a rule as \nhard and inflexible as itself.\nTechnique integrates the machine into society. It constructs the \nkind of world the machine needs and introduces order where the in­\ncoherent banging of machinery heaped up ruins. It clarifies, ar­\nranges, and rationalizes; it does in the domain of the abstract what \nthe machine did in the domain of labor. It is efficient and brings \nefficiency to everything. Moreover, technique is sparing in the usa \nof the machine, which has traditionally been exploited to conceal\n\f\ntech niques6 )\ndefects of organization. \"Machines sanctioned social inefficiency,\" \nsays Mumford. Technique, on the other hand, leads to a more \nrational and less indiscriminate use of machines. It places ma­\nchines exactly where they ought to be and requires of them just \nwhat they ought to do\nThis brings us to two contrasting forms of social growth. Henri \nGuitton says: “Social growth was formerly reflexive or instinctive, \nthat is to say, unconscious. But new circumstances (the machine) \nnow compel us to recognize a kind of social development that is ra­\ntional, intelligent, and conscious. We may ask ourselves whether \nthis is the beginning not only of the era of a spatially finite world but \nalso of the era of a conscious world.” All-embracing technique is \nin fact the consciousness of the mechanized world.\nTechnique integrates everything. It avoids shock and sensational \nevents. Man is not adapted to a world of steel; technique adapts him \nto it. It changes the arrangement of this blind world so that man \ncan be a part of it without colliding with its rough edges, without \nthe anguish of being delivered up to the inhuman. Technique thus \nprovides a model; it specifies attitudes that are valid once and for \nall The anxiety aroused in man by the turbulence of the machine is \nsoothed by the consoling hum of a unified society.\nAs long as technique was represented exclusively by the ma­\nchine, it was possible to speak of “man and the machine.” The ma­\nchine remained an external object, and man (though significantly \ninfluenced by it in his professional, private, and psychic life) re­\nmained none the less independent He was in a position to assert \nhimself apart from the machine; he was able to adopt a position \nwith respect to it.\nBut when technique enters into every area of life, including the \nhuman, it ceases to be external to man and becomes his very sub­\nstance. It is no longer face to face with man but is integrated with \nhim, and it progressively absorbs him. In this respect, technique is \nradically different from the machine. This transformation, so obvi­\nous in modem society, is the result of the fact that technique has \nbecome autonomous.\nWhen I state that technique leads to mechanization, I am not \nrefecting to the simple fact of human adaptation to the machine. Of \ncourse, such a process of adaptation exists, but it is caused by the ac-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 7\ntion of the machine. What we are concerned with here, however, is \na kind of mechanization in itself. If we may ascribe to the machine \na superior form of \"know-how,’*  the mechanization which results \nfrom technique is the application of this higher form to all domains \nhitherto foreign to the machine; we can even say that technique is \ncharacteristic of precisely that realm in which the machine itself \ncan play no role. It is a radical error to think of technique and ma­\nchine as interchangeable; from the very beginning we must be on \nguard against this misconception.\nScience and Technique. Almost immediately we come up against \na second problem. It is true that it is another pons asinorum; one \nhesitates even to mention it since the question has been so often \ndiscussed. The relation between science and technique is a stand­\nard subject for graduate theses— in all the trappings of nineteenth- \ncentury experimental science. Everyone has been taught that tech­\nnique is an application of science; more particularly (science being \npure speculation), technique figures as the point of contact between \nmaterial reality and the scientific formula. But it also appears as \nthe practical product, the application of the formulas to practical \nlife.\nThis traditional view is radically false. It takes into account only \na single category of science and only a short period of time: it is \ntrue only for the physical sciences and for the nineteenth century. It \nis not possible therefore to base a general study on it nor, as we are \nattempting to do here, an up-to-date review of the situation.\nA few simple remarks suffice to destroy our confidence in these \nviews. Historically, technique preceded science; even primitive man \nwas acquainted with certain techniques. The first techniques of \nHellenistic civilization were Oriental; they were not derived from \nGreek science. Thus, historically speaking, the relationship between \nscience and technique ought to be reversed.\nHowever, technique began to develop and extend itself only after \nscience appeared; to progress, technique had to wait for science. \nBertrand Gille has rightly said, in this historical perspective: \"Tech­\nnique, by means of repeated experiments, posed the problems, \nderived general notions and the four primary elements; but it had \nto wait for the solutions\"— which science provided.\nIn the present era, the most casual inspection reveals an entirely\n\f\nTECHNIQUES«>\ndifferent relationship. In every instance, it is clear that the border \nbetween technical activity and scientific activity is not at all sharply \ndefined.\nWhen we speak oi technique in historical science, we mean a cer­\ntain kind of preparatory work: textual research, reading, collation, \nstudy of monuments, criticism, and exegesis. These represent an \nensemble of technical operations which aim first at interpretation \nand then at historical synthesis, the true work of science. Here, \nagain, technique comes first.\nEven in physics, in certain instances, technique precedes science. \nThe best-known example is the steam engine, a pure achievement of \nexperimental genius. The sequence of inventions and improvements \nof Solomon De Caus, Christian Huygens, Denes Papin, Thomas \nSavery, and so on, rest on practical trial and error. The scientific \nexplanation of the various phenomena involved was to come much \nlater, after a lapse of two centuries, and even then it was not easy to \nformulate. There is still no automatic link between science and \ntechnique. The relation is not that simple; there is more and more \ninteraction between them. Today all scientific research presupposes \nenormous technical preparation (as, for example, in atomic re­\nsearch). And very often it is some simple technical modification \nwhich allows further scientific progress.\nWhen the technical means do not exist, science does not advance. \nMichael Faraday was aware of the most recent discoveries concern­\ning the constitution of matter, but was unable to formulate precise \ntheories because techniques for the production of vacua did not yet \nexist. Scientific results had to await high-vacuum techniques. The \nmedical value of penicillin was discovered in 1912 by a French \nphysician, but he had no technical means of producing and con. \nserving penicillin; misgivings therefore arose about the discovery \nand led to its even tual abandonment.\nThe majority of investigators in a laboratory are technicians who \nperform tasks far removed from what is commonly imagined to be \nscientific work. The research worker is no longer a solitary genius. \nAs Robert Jungk says: “He works as a member of a team and is will­\ning to give up his freedom of research as well as personal recognition \nin exchange for the assistance and equipment a great laboratory \noffers him. These two tilings are the indispensable conditions with­\nout which he cannot even dream of realizing his projects. . . .*\n\f\nThe Technological Society (9\nPure science seems to be yielding its place to an applied science \nwhich now and again reaches a brilliant peak from which new \ntechnical research becomes possible. Conversely, certain technical \nmodifications— in airplanes, for instance— which may seem simple \nand mechanical, presuppose complex scientific work. The problem \nof reaching supersonic velocities is one. The considered opinion of \nNorbert Wiener is that the younger generation of research workers \nin the United States consists primarily of technicians who are un­\nable to do research at all without the help of machines, large teams \nof men, and enormous amounts of money.\nThe relation between science and technique becomes even less \nclear when we consider the newer fields, which have no boundaries. \nWhere does biological technique begin and where does it end? In \nmodern psychology and sociology, what can we call technique, \nsince in the application of these sciences everything is technique?\nBut it is not application which characterizes technique, for, with­\nout technique (previous or concomitant), science has no way of \nexisting. If we disown technique, we abandon the domain of science \nand enter into that of hypothesis and theory. In political economy \n(despite the recent efforts of economists to distinguish the bounda­\nries between science and economic technique), we shall demon­\nstrate that it is economic technique which forms the very substance \nof economic thought.\nThe established foundations have indeed been shaken. But the \nproblem of these relations, in view of the enormity of the technical \nworld and the reduction of the scientific, would seem to be an aca­\ndemic problem of interest only to philosophers— speculation with­\nout content. Today it is no longer the frontiers of science which are \nat issue, but the frontiers of man; and the technical phenomenon is \nmuch more significant with regard to the human situation than \nwith regard to the scientific. It is no longer in reference to science \nthat technique must be defined. We need not pursue philosophy of \nscience here, or establish, ideally or intellectually, what may be the \nrelations between action and science. What we must do is look about \nus and note certain obvious things which seem to escape the all too \nintelligent philosophers.\nIt is not a question of minimizing the importance of scientific ac­\ntivity, but of recognizing that in fact scientific activity has been \nsuperseded by technical activity to such a degree that we can no\n\f\nTECHNIQUES10 )\nlonger conceive of science without its technical outcome As Charles \nCamichel has observed, the two are closer than ever before. The \nvery fact that techniques advance with great rapidity demands a \ncorresponding scientific advance, and sets off a general accelera­\ntion.\nMoreover, techniques are always put to immediate use The in­\nterval which traditionally separates a scientific discovery and its \napplication in everyday life has been progressively shortened As \nsoon as a discovery is made, a concrete application is sought Capi­\ntal becomes interested, or the state, and the discovery enters the \npublic domain before anyone has had a chance to reckon all the \nconsequences or to recognize its full import. The scientist might act \nmore prudently; he might even be afraid to launch his carefully cal­\nculated laboratory findings into the world. But how can he resist \nthe pressure of the facts? How can he resist the pressure of money? \nHow is he to resist success, publicity, public acclaim? Or the gen­\neral state of mind which makes technical application the last word? \nHow is he to resist the desire to pursue his research? Such is the \ndilemma of the researcher today. Either he allows his findings to be \ntechnologically applied or he is forced to break off his research. \nSuch is the drama of the atomic physicists who saw that only the \nlaboratories at Los Alamos could provide them with the technical \ninstruments necessary to the continuation of their work. The state, \nthen, exercises a very real monopoly, and the scientist is obliged to \naccept its conditions. As one of the atomic- scientists put it: “What \nkeeps me here is the possibility of using for my work a special mi­\ncroscope which exists nowhere else” (Jungk). The scientist is no \nlonger able to hold out: “Even science, especially the magnificent \nscience cf our o **vn  day, has hcuinc an nuiut-m ci lecimique, a \nmere means” (Mauss). There we have, indeed, the final word: \nscience has become an instrument of technique.\nLater, we shall consider how it has come about that scientific \nutilitarianism has gained such momentum from technique that a \ndisinterested piece of research is no longer possible. It has always \nbeen necessary to have a scientific substructure, but today it is \nscarcely possible to effect a separation between scientific and techni­\ncal research. Indeed, our omnivorous technique (and this repre­\nsents in part Einstein’s thought) may in the end make science \nsterile."

    "raw_text": "The Technological Society (11\nI shall often use the term technique in place of the more com­\nmonly used term science, and designate as techniques work that is \nusually termed scientific. This is due to the close association of \ntechnique and science which I have pointed out and which I shall \ndiscuss more fully later on.\nOrganization and Technique. A third element will help us formu­\nlate our problem more clearly. I have already pointed out that we \nmust understand the term technique in a broader sense. But some \nauthors, not wishing to deviate from traditional linguistic usage, \nprefer to keep to its current meaning and seek another term to \ndesignate the phenomena we are describing here.\nAccording to Arnold Toynbee, history is divided into three pe­\nriods, and it is on the point of passing from the technical period \ninto the period of organization. I agree with Toynbee that mechani­\ncal technique no longer characterizes our times. However important \nand impressive mechanical technique remains, it is only accessory \nto other factors which are much more decisive, if less spectacular. \nI have in mind the vast amount of organization in every field, the \nrecognition of which led James Burnham to write The Managerial \nRevolution.\nBut I cannot agree with Toynbee in his choice of terms or in the \nline he draws between the technical period and the period of or­\nganization. In his sketchy conception of technique, for which he \nhas been severely criticized, the confusion between machine and \ntechnique remains. He has limited the realm of technique to what \nit was in the past, without considering what it is now.\nIn reality, what Toynbee calls organization, and Burnham calls \nmanagerial action, is technique applied to social, economic, or ad­\nministrative life. What but technique is the “organization” defined \nin the following? “Organization is the process which consists in \nassigning appropriate tasks to individuals or to groups so as to at­\ntain, in an efficient and economic way, and by the coordination \nand combination of all their activities, the objectives agreed upon” \n(Sheldon). This leads to the standardization and the rationaliza­\ntion of economic and administrative life, as Antoine Mas has well \nshown. “Standardization means resolving in advance all the prob­\nlems that might possibly impede the functioning of an organization. \nIt is not a matter of leaving it to inspiration, ingenuity, nor even \nintelligence to find a solution at the moment some difficulty arises;\n\f\nTECHNIQUES1 3 )\nit is rather in some way to anticipate both the difficulty and its \nresolution. From then on, standardization creates impersonality, in \nthe sense that organization relies more on methods and instructions \nthan on individuals.” We thus have all the marks of a technique. \nOrganization is a technique— and Andre L. A. Vincent had good \nreason to write: \"To approach the optimum combination of factors, \nor the optimum dimension is . . .  to accomplish technical prog­\nress in the form of a better organization.”\nIt will no doubt be asked: What is the point of discussing these \nterms, since, at bottom, you are in agreement with Toynbee? But \nthese discussions are important: Toynbee separates centuries and \nphenomena which ought to remain united. He would have us be­\nlieve that organization is something other than technique, that man \nhas in a way discovered a new field of action and new methods, \nand that we must study organization as a new phenomenon, when \nit is nothing of the sort. I, on the other hand, insist on the con­\ntinuity of the technical process. It is this process which is taking on \na new aspect (I would say, its true aspect) and is developing on a \nworld-wide scale.\nWhat are the consequences? The first is that the problems cre­\nated by mechanical technique will be heightened to a degree as \nyet incalculable, as a result of the application of technique to ad­\nministration and to all spheres of life. Toynbee believes that this \norganization which is succeeding technique is in some way a coun­\nterbalance to it, and a remedy (and that is a comforting view of \nhistory). But it seems to me that the exact opposite is true, that this \ndevelopment adds to the technical problems by offering a partial \nsolution to old problems, itself based on the very methods that \ncreated the problems in the first place. This is the age-old proce­\ndure of digging a new hole to fill up an old one.\nA second consequence: If what we are witnessing is only an ex­\ntension of the domain of technique, what was said above about \nmechanization is understandable. Toynbee writes of organization \nas a phenomenon whose effects cannot yet be seen. However, we \ncan be confident that the final result will be that technique will \nassimilate everything to the machine; the ideal for which technique \nstrives is the mechanization of everything it encounters. It is clear, \ntherefore, that my opposition to Toynbee, even if it appears to be \nmerely verbal, is significant. The technical age continues to ad*\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 3\nvance and we cannot even say that we are at the peak of its ex­\npansion. In fact, some decisive conquests remain to be made—  \nman, among others— and it is hard to see what is to prevent \ntechnique from making them. Thus, even if this is not a question \nof a new factor, it is at least clear now what the phenomenon in­\nvolves and what it signifies.\nDefinitions. Once we stop identifying technique and machine, the \ndefinitions of technique we find are inadequate to the established \nfacts. Marcel Mauss, the sociologist, understands the problem ad­\nmirably, and has given various definitions of technique, some of \nwhich are excellent. Let us take one that is open to criticism and, \nby criticizing it, state our ideas more precisely: “Technique is a \ngroup of movements, of actions generally and mostly manual, or­\nganized, and traditional, all of which unite to reach a known end, \nfor example, physical, chemical or organic.”\nThis definition is perfectly valid for the sociologist who deals \nwith the primitive. It offers, as Mauss shows, numerous advantages. \nFor example, it eliminates from the realm of techniques questions \nof religion or art (magic, however, ought to be classified among \ntechniques, as we shall see later). But these advantages apply only \nin a historical perspective. In the modem perspective, this defini­\ntion is insufficient.\nCan it be said that the technique of elaboration of an economic \nplan ( purely a technical operation) is the result of such movements \nas Mauss describes? No particular motion or physical act is in­\nvolved. An economic plan is purely an intellectual operation, \nwhich nevertheless is a technique.\nWhen we consider Mauss’s statement that technique is restricted \nto manual activity, the inadequacy of his definition is even more \napparent. Today most technical operations are not manual. \nWhether machines are substituted for men, or technique becomes \nintellectual, the most important sphere in the world today (because \nin it lie the seeds of future development) is scarcely that of manual \nlabor. True, manual labor is still die basis of mechanical operation, \nand we would do well to recall Jungers principal argument \nagainst the illusion of technical progress. He holds that the more \ntechnique is perfected, the more it requires secondary manual \nlabor; and, furthermore, that the volume of manual operations \nincreases faster than the volume of mechanical operations. This\n\f\nTECHNIQUES14)\nmay be so, but the most important feature of techniques today is \nthat they do not depend on manual labor but on organization and \non the arrangement of machines.\nI am willing to accept the term organized, as Mauss uses it in \nhis definition, but I must part company with him in respect to his \nuse of the term traditional. And this differentiates the technique of \ntoday from that of previous civilizations. It is true that in all civiliza­\ntions technique has existed as tradition, that is, by the transmission \nof inherited processes that slowly ripen and are even more slowly \nmodified; that evolve under the pressure of circumstances along \nwith the body social; that create automatisms which become \nhereditary and are integrated into each new form of technique.\nBut how can anyone fail to see that none of this holds true today? \nTechnique has become autonomous; it has fashioned an omnivo­\nrous world which obeys its own laws and which has renounced all \ntradition. Technique no longer rests on tradition, but rather on \nprevious technical procedures; and its evolution is too rapid, too \nupsetting, to integrate the older traditions. This fact, which we \nshall study at some length later on, also explains why it is not \nquite true that a technique assures a result known in advance. It \nis true if one considers only the user: the driver of an automobile \nknows that he can expect to go faster when he steps on the ac­\ncelerator. But even in the field of the mechanical, with the advent \nof the technique of servo-mechanisms,1  this axiom does not hold \ntrue. In these cases the machine itself adapts as it operates: this \nvery fact makes it difficult to predict the final result of its activity. \nThis becomes clear when one considers not use but technical \nprogress— although, at the present time, the two are closely asso­\nciated. It is less and less exact to maintain that the user remains \nfor very long in possession of a technique the results of which he \ncan predict; constant invention ceaselessly upsets his habits.\nFinally, Mauss appears to think that the goal attained is of a \nchemical or a physical order. But today we recognize that tech­\nniques go further. Psychoanalysis and sociology have passed into \nthe sphere of technical application; one example of this is propa-\n1 M echanism s which involve so-called “feedback,” in which inform ation m easuring \nthe degree to which an effector (e.g., an oil furance) is in error with respect to \nproducing a desired value (e.g., a fixed room  temperature) is \"fed back” to the \neffector by a m onitor (e.g., a thermostat). (Trans.)\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2 5\nganda. Here the operation is of a moral, psychic, and spiritual \ncharacter. However, that does not prevent it from being a tech­\nnique. But what we are talking about is a world once given over \nto the pragmatic approach and now being taken over by method. \nWe can say, therefore, that Mauss’s definition, which was valid for \ntechnique until the eighteenth century, is not applicable to our \ntimes. In this respect Mauss has been the victim of his own socio­\nlogical studies of primitive people, as his classification of tech­\nniques (food gathering, the making of garments, transport, etc.) \nclearly shows.\nFurther examples of inadequate definition are those supplied by \nJean Fourastie and others who pursue the same line of research as \nhe. For Fourastie, technical progress is “the growth of the volume \nof production obtained through a fixed quantity of raw material or \nhuman labor”— that is, technique is uniquely that which promotes \nthis increase in yield. He then goes on to say that it is possible to \nanalyze this theorem under three aspects. In yield in kind, tech­\nnique is that which enables raw materials to be managed in order \nto obtain some predetermined product; in financial yield, tech­\nnique is that which enables the increase in production to take place \nthrough the increase of capital investment; in yield of human labor, \ntechnique is that which increases the quantity of work produced \nby a fixed unit, of human labor. In this connection we must thank \nFourastie for correcting Jiinger’s error—Jiinger opposes technical \nprogress to economic progress because they would be, in his opin­\nion, contradictory; Fourastie shows that, on the contrary, the two \ncoincide. However, we must nevertheless challenge his definition \nof technique on the ground that it is completely arbitrary.\nIt is arbitrary, first of all, because it is purely economic and \ncontemplates only economic yield. There are innumerable tradi­\ntional techniques which are not based on a quest for economic \nyield and which have no economic character. It is precisely these \nwhich Mauss alludes to in his definition; and they still exist. \nAmong the myriad modern techniques, there are many which have \nnothing to do with economic life. Take, for example, a technique of \nmastication based on the science of nutrition, or techniques of \nsport, as in the Boy Scout movement— in these cases we can see a \nkind of yield, but this yield has little to do with economics.\nIn other cases, there are economic results, but these results are\n\f\nI  6  ) TECHNIQUES\nsecondary and cannot be said to be characteristic. Take, for ex­\nample, the modem calculating machine. The solving of equations \nin seventy variables, required in certain econometric research, is \nimpossible except with an electronic calculating machine. How­\never, it is not the economic productivity which results from the \nutilization of this machine by which its importance is measured.\nA second criticism of Fourasti6’s definition is that he assigns an \nexclusively productive character to technique. The growth of the \nvolume of production is an even narrower concept than yield. The \ntechniques which have shown the greatest development are not \ntechniques of production at all. For example, techniques in the care \nof human beings (surgery, psychology, and so on) have nothing \nto do with productivity. The most modern techniques of destruc­\ntion have even less to do with productivity; the atomic and hydro­\ngen bombs and the Germans’ V i and V2 weapons are all examples \nof the most powerful technical creations of man’s mind. Human \ningenuity and mechanical skill are today being exploited along \nlines which have little reference to productivity.\nNothing equals the perfection of our war machines. Warships and \nwarplanes are vastly more perfect than their counterparts in ci­\nvilian life. The organization of the army— its transport, supplies, \nadministration— is much more precise than any civilian organiza­\ntion. The smallest error in the realm of war would cost countless \nlives and would be measured in terms of victory or defeat\nWhat is the yield there? Very poor, on the whole. Where is the \nproductivity? There is none.\nVincent, in his definition, likewise refers to productivity: “Tech­\nnical progress is the relative variation in world production in a \ngiven sphere between two given periods.” This definition, useful of \ncourse irom the economic point of view, leads him at once into a \ndilemma. He is obliged to distinguish technical progress from \nprogress of technique (which corresponds to the progression of \ntechniques in all fields) and to distinguish these two from “techni­\ncal progress, properly speaking,” which concerns variations in \nproductivity. This is an inference made from natural phenomena, \nfor, in his definition, Vincent is obliged to recognize that technical \nprogress includes natural phenomena (the greater or lesser richness \nof an ore, of the soil, etc.) by definition the very contrary of tech­\nniqueI\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 7\nThese linguistic acrobatics and hairsplittings suffice to prove the \ninanity of such a definition, which aims at a single aspect of techni­\ncal progress and includes elements which do not belong to tech­\nnique. From this definition, Vincent infers that technical progress \nis slow. But what is true of economic productivity is not true of \ntechnical progress in general. If one considers technique shorn of \none whole part, and that its most progressive, one can indeed assert \nthat it is slow in its progress. This abstraction is even more illusory \nwhen one claims to measure technical progress. The definition \nproposed by Fourastie is inexact because it excludes everything \nwhich does not refer to production, and all effects which are not \neconomic.\nThis tendency to reduce the technical problem to the dimensions \nof the technique of production is also present in the works of so \nenlightened a scholar as Georges Friedmann. In his introduction to \nthe UNESCO Colloquium on technique, he appears to start out \nwith a very broad definition. But in the second paragraph, without \nwarning, he begins to reduce everything to the level of economic \nproduction.\nWhat gives rise to this limitation of the problem? One factor \nmight be a tacit optimism, a need to hold that technical progress \nis unconditionally valid— which leads to the selection of the most \npositive aspect of technical progress, as though it were its only one.\nThis may have guided Fourastie, but it does not seem to hold \ntrue in Friedmann’s case. I believe that the reasoning behind Fried­\nmann’s way of thinking is to be found in the turn of the scientific \nmind. All aspects— mechanical, economic, psychological, socio­\nlogical— of the techniques of production have been subjected to \ninnumerable specialized studies; as a result, we are beginning to \nlearn in a more precise and scientific way about the relationships \nbetween man and the industrial machine. Since the scientist must \nuse the materials he has at hand; and since almost nothing is known \nabout the relationship of man to the automobile, the telephone, or \nthe radio, and absolutely nothing about the relationship of man to \nthe Apparat or about the sociological effects of other aspects of \ntechnique, the scientist moves unconsciously toward the sphere of \nwhat is known scientifically, and tries to limit the whole question \nto that.\nThere is another element in this scientific attitude: only that is\n\f\nTECHNIQUES18)\nknowable which is expressed (or, at least, can be expressed) in \nnumbers. To get away from the so-called “arbitrary and subjec­\ntive,” to escape ethical or literary judgments (which, as everyone \nknows, are trivial and unfounded), the scientist must get back to \nnumbers. What, after all, can one hope to deduce from the purely \nqualitative statement that the worker is fatigued? But when bio­\nchemistry makes it possible to measure fatigability numerically, it \nis at last possible to take account of the worker’s fatigue. Then \nthere is hope of finding a solution. However, an entire realm of \neffects of technique— indeed, the largest— is not reducible to num­\nbers; and it is precisely that realm which we are investigating in \nthis work. Yet, since what can be said about it is apparently not \nto be taken seriously, it is better for the scientist to shut his eyes \nand regard it as a realm of pseudo-problems, or simply as non­\nexistent. The “scientific” position frequently consists of denying \nthe existence of whatever does not belong to current scientific \nmethod. The problem of the industrial machine, however, is a \nnumerical one in nearly all its aspects. Hence, all of technique is \nunintentionally reduced to a numerical question. In the case of \nVincent, this is intentional, as his definition shows; “We embrace in \ntechnical progress all kinds of progress . . . provided that they \nare treatable numerically in a reliable way.”\nH. D. Lasswell’s definition of technique as “the ensemble of prac­\ntices by which one uses available resources in order to achieve \ncertain valued ends” also seems to follow the conventions cited \nabove, and to embrace only industrial technique. Here it might be \ncontested whether technique does indeed permit the realization \nof values. However, to judge from Lasswell’s examples, he con­\nceives the terms of his definition in an extremely broad manner. \nHe gives a list of values and the corresponding techniques. As \nvalues, for example, he lists riches, power, well-beihg, affection; \nand as techniques, the techniques of government, production, \nmedicine, the family, and so on. Lasswell’s conception of value \nmay seem somewhat strange; the term is obviously not apt. But \nwhat he has to say indicates that he gives techniques their full \nscope. Moreover, he makes it quite clear that it is necessary to \nshow the effects of technique not only on inanimate objects but \nalso on people. I am, therefore, in substantial agreement with this \nconception."

    "raw_text": "The Technological Society ( 1 9\nTechnical Operation and Technical Phenomenon. With the use \nof these few guideposts, we can now try to formulate, if not a full \ndefinition, at least an approximate definition of technique. But we \nmust keep this in mind: we are not concerned with the different in­\ndividual techniques. Everyone practices a particular technique, \nand it is difficult to come to know them all. Yet in this great di­\nversity we can find certain points in common, certain tendencies \nand principles shared by them all. It is clumsy to call these common \nfeatures Technique with a capital T; no one would recognize his \nparticular technique behind this terminology. Nevertheless, it takes \naccount of a reality— the technical phenomenon— which is world­\nwide today.\nIf we recognize that the method each person employs to attain \na result is in fact, his particular technique, the problem of means \nis raised. In fact, technique is nothing more than means and the \nensemble of means. This, of course, does not lessen the importance \nof the problem. Our civilization is first and foremost a civilization \nof means; in the reality of modern life, the means, it would seem, \nare more important than the ends. Any other assessment of the \nsituation is mere idealism.\nTechniques considered as methods of operation present certain \ncommon characteristics and certain general tendencies, but we \ncannot devote ourselves exclusively to them. To do this would lead \nto a more specialized study than I have in mind. The technical \nphenomenon is much more complex than any synthesis of char­\nacteristics common to individual techniques. If we desire to come \ncloser to a definition of technique, we must in fact differentiate \nbetween the technical operation and the technical phenomenon.\nThe technical operation includes every operation carried out in \naccordance with a certain method in order to attaiii a particular \nend. It can be as rudimentary as splintering a flint or as compli­\ncated as programming an electronic brain. In every case, it is the \nmethod which characterizes the operation. It may be more or less \neffective or more or less complex, but its nature is always the same. \nIt is this which leads us to think that there is a continuity in techni­\ncal operations and that only the great refinement resulting from \nscientific progress differentiates the modern technical operation \nfrom the primitive one.\nEvery operation obviously entails a certain technique, even the\n\f\nTECHNIQUES2 0 )\ngathering of fruit among primitive peoples— climbing the tree, \npicking the fruit as quickly and with as little effort as possible, dis­\ntinguishing between the ripe and the unripe fruit, and so on. How­\never, what characterizes technical action within a particular ac­\ntivity is the search for greater efficiency. Completely natural and \nspontaneous effort is replaced by a complex of acts designed to im­\nprove, say, the yield. It is this which prompts the creation of tech­\nnical forms, starting from simple forms of activity. These technical \nforms are not necessarily more complicated than the spontaneous \nones, but they are more efficient and better adapted.\nThus, technique creates means, but the technical operation still- \noccurs on the same level as that of the worker who does the work. \nThe skilled work'er, like the primitive huntsman, remains a techni­\ncal operator; their attitudes differ only to a small degree.\nBut two factors enter into the extensive field of technical opera­\ntion: consciousness and judgment. This double intervention pro­\nduces what I call the technical phenomenon. What characterizes \nthis double intervention? Essentially, it takes what was previously \ntentative, unconscious, and spontaneous and brings it into the \nrealm of clear, voluntary, and reasoned concepts.\nWhen Andre Leroi-Gourhan tabulates the efficiency of Zulu \nswords and arrows in terms of the most up-to-date knowledge of \nweaponry, he is doing work that is obviously different from that of \nthe swordsmith of Bechuanaland who created the form of the \nsword. The swordsmith’s choice of form was unconscious and \nspontaneous; although it can now be justified by numerical calcu­\nlations, such calculations had no place whatever in the technical \noperation he performed. But reason did, inevitably, enter into the \nprocess because man spontaneously imitates nature in his activi­\nties. Accomplishments that merely copy nature, however, have no \nfuture (for instance, the imitation of birds’ wings from Icarus to \nAder). Reason makes it possible to produce objects in terms of \ncertain features, certain abstract requirements; and this in turn \nleads, not to the imitation of nature, but to the ways of technique.\nThe intervention of rational judgment in the technical operation \nhas important consequences. Man becomes aware that it is possible \nto find new and different means. Reason upsets pragmatic tradi­\ntions and creates new operational methods and new tools; it \nexamines rationally the possibilities of more extensive and less rigid\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( s i\nexperimentation. Reason in these ways multiplies technical opera­\ntions to a high degree of diversity. But it also operates in the op­\nposite direction: it considers results and takes account of the fixed \nend of technique— efficiency. It notes what every means devised \nis capable of accomplishing and selects from the various means at \nits disposal with a view to securing the ones that are the most \nefficient, the best adapted to the desired end. Thus the multiplicity \nof means is reduced to one: the most efficient And here reason \nappears clearly in the guise of technique.\nIn addition, there is the intervention of consciousness. Conscious­\nness shows clearly, and to everybody, the advantages of technique \nand what it can accomplish. The technician takes stock of alterna­\ntive possibilities. The immediate result is that he seeks to apply \nthe new methods in fields which traditionally had been left to \nchance, pragmatism, and instinct. The intervention of conscious­\nness causes a rapid and far-flung extension of technique.\nThe twofold intervention of reason and consciousness in the \ntechnical world, which produces the technical phenomenon, can \nbe described as the quest of the one best means in every field. And \nthis “one best means’*  is, in fact, the technical means. It is the \naggregate of these means that produces technical civilization.\nThe technical phenomenon is the main preoccupation of our \ntime; in every field men seek to find the most efficient method. But \nour investigations have reached a limit. It is no longer the best \nrelative means which counts, as compared to other means also in \nuse. The choice is less and less a subjective one among several \nmeans which are potentially applicable. It is really a question of \nfinding the best means in the absolute sense, on the basis of nu­\nmerical calculation.\nIt is, then, the specialist who chooses the means; he is able to \ncarry out the calculations that demonstrate the superiority of the \nmeans chosen over all others. Thus a science of means comes into \nbeing— a science of techniques, progressively elaborated.\nThis science extends to greatly diverse areas; it ranges from the act \nof shaving to the act of organizing the landing in Normandy, or to \ncremating thousands of deportees. Today no human activity es­\ncapes this technical imperative. There is a technique of organiza- \nticsi (the great fact of organization described by Toynbee fits very \nwell into this conception of the technical phenomenon), just as\n\f\n22  ) TECHNIQUES\nthere is a technique of friendship and a technique of swimming. \nUnder the circumstances, it is easy to see how far we are from \nconfusing technique and machine. And, if we examine the broader \nareas where this search for means is taking place, we find three \nprincipal subdivisions of modem technique, in addition to the \nmechanical (which is the most conspicuous but which I shall \nnot discuss because it is so well known) and to the forms of in­\ntellectual technique (card indices, libraries, and so on).\nl)  Economic technique is almost entirely subordinated to pro­\nduction, and ranges from the organization of labor to economic \nplanning. This technique differs from the others in its object and \ngoal But its problems are the same as those of all other technical \nactivities.\nz) The technique of organization concerns the great masses and \napplies not only to commercial or industrial affairs of magnitude \n(coming, consequently, under the jurisdiction of the economic) but \nabo to states and to administration and police power. This organi­\nzational technique is also applied to warfare and insures the power \nof an army at least as much as its weapons. Everything in the \nlegal field also depends on organizational technique.\n3 ) Human technique takes various forms, ranging all the way \nfrom medicine and genetics to propaganda (pedagogical tech­\nniques, vocational guidance, publicity, etc.). Here man himself be­\ncomes the object of technique.\nWe observe, in the case of each of these subdivisions, that the \nsubordinate techniques may be very different in kind and not \nnecessarily similar one to another as techniques. They have the \nsame goal and preoccupation, however, and are thus related. The \nthree subdivisions show the wide extent of the technical phenome \nnon. In fact, nothing at all escapes technique today. There is no \nfield where technique is not dominant— this is easy to say and is \nscarcely surprising. We are so habituated to machines that there \nseems to be nothing left to discover.\nHas the fact of technique no intrinsic importance? Does it spring \nmerely from the march of time? Or does it represent a problem pe­\nculiar to our times? Our discussion of the biology of technique will \nbring us face to face with this question. But first we must survey in \ndetail the vast field which the technical phenomenon covers, in \norder to become fully cognizant of what it signifies."

    "raw_text": "The Technological Society( S3\nHistorical Development\nPrimitive Technique. It is scarcely possible to give here a his­\ntory of technique in its universal aspect, as we have just defined it \nWe are only now beginning to know a little of the history of me­\nchanical technique. It is enough to recall the works of Andre \nLeroi-Gourhan, Richard Lefebvre des Noettes, Marc Bloch, and \nothers. But the full history of technique has yet to be written. My \nbook is not a history. I shall speak in a historical vein only when it is \nnecessary to the understanding of the technical problem in soci­\nety today.\nTechnical activity is the most primitive activity of man. There is \nthe technique of hunting, of fishing, of food gathering; and later of \nweapons, clothing, and building. And here we face a mystery. \nWhat is the origin of this activity? It is a phenomenon which ad­\nmits of no complete explanation. By patient research, one finds \nareas of imitation, transitions from one technical form to another, \nexamples of penetration. But at the core there is a closed area—  \nthe phenomenon of invention.\nIt can be shown that technique is absorbed into man’s psychol­\nogy and depends upon that psychology and upon what has been \ncalled technical motivation. But we have no explanation of how an \nactivity which once did not exist came to be.\nHow did man come to domesticate animals, to choose certain \nplants to cultivate? The motivating force, we are told, was \nreligious,2  and the first plants were cultivated with some magical \nend in mind. This is likely, but how was the selection made? And \nhow did it happen that the majority of these plants were edible? \nHow did man come to refine metals and make bronze? Was it \nchance, as the legend of the discovery of Phoenician glass has it? \nThis is obviously not the answer.\nOne is left with an enigma; and there is some point in emphasiz­\ning that there is here the same mysterious quality as in the appear­\nance of life itself. Each primitive operation of man implies the \nbridging of such an enormous gulf between instinct and the techni-\n7 See, for exam ple, Pierre Deffootaines'i Geographic dct religiont.\n\f\nTECHNIQUES* 4 )\ncal act that a mystic aura hovers about all subsequent develop­\nment. Our modern worship of technique derives from man’s \nancestral worship of the mysterious and marvelous character of \nhis own handiwork.\nIt has not been sufficiently emphasized that technique has \nevolved along two distinct paths. There is the concrete \ntechnique of homo faber— man the maker— to which we are \naccustomed, and which poses the problems we have normally \nstudied. There is also the technique, of a more or less spiritual \norder, which we call magic.\nIt may seem questionable; nevertheless, magic is a technique \nin the strictest sense of the word, as has been clearly demonstrated \nby Marcel Mauss. Magic developed along with other techniques as \nan expression of man’s will to obtain certain results of a spiritual \norder. To attain them, man made use of an aggregate of rites, \nformulas, and procedures which, once established, do not vary. \nStrict adherence to form is one of the characteristics of magic: \nforms and rituals, masks which never vary, the same kind of prayer \nwheels, the same ingredients for mystical drugs, for formulae for \ndivination, and so on. All these became set and were passed on: \nthe slightest variation in word or gesture would alter the magical \nequilibrium.\nThere is a relationship between the ready-made formula and a \nprecise result. The gods being propitiated obey such an invocation \nout of necessity; all the more reason that they be given no oppor­\ntunity to escape compliance because the invocation is not correctly \nformulated. This fixity is a manifestation of the technical character \nof magic: when the best possible means of obtaining the desired \nresult has been found, why change it? Every magical means, in \nthe eyes of the person who uses it, is the most efficient one.\nIn the spiritual realm, magic displays all the characteristics \nof a technique. It is a mediator between man and ‘ the higher \npowers,” just as other techniques mediate between man and matter. \nIt leads to efficacy because it subordinates the power of the gods \nto men, and it secures a predetermined result. It affirms human \npower in that it seeks to subordinate the gods to men, just as tech­\nnique serves to cause nature to obey.\nMagic clearly displays the characteristics of primitive technique, \nas Leroi-Gourhan indicates when he says that technique is a\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 5\ncloak for man, a kind of cosmic vestment. In his conflict with mat­\nter, in his struggle to survive, man interposes an intermediary \nagency between himself and his environment, and this agency has \na twofold function. It is a means of protection and defense: alone \nman is too weak to defend himself. It is also a means of assimilation: \nthrough technique, man is able to utilize to his profit powers \nthat are alien or hostile. He is able to manipulate his surroundings \nso that they are no longer merely his surroundings but become a \nfactor of equilibr-ktm'and of profit to him. Thus, as a result of tech­\nnique' man transforms his adversaries into allies.\nThese characteristics of material technique correspond perfectly \nto the characteristics of magical technique. There, also, man is in \nconflict with external forces, with the world of mystery, spiritual \npowers, and mystical currents. But there, too, man erects a \nbarrier around himself, for he would not know how to defend him­\nself by his own unaided intellect He uses any means that will \nserve him both for defense and for adjustment. He turns to his \nown profit the hostile powers, which are obliged to obey him by \nvirtue of his magical formulas. Masson-Oursel, in a recent study, \nconfirms this. He shows that magic is basically a “scholasticism of \nefficiency” which man employs as an instrument against his en­\nvironment; that magic is pragmatic, yet has a precision that must \nbe called objective; and that its efficiency is demonstrated only in \ncertain “consecrations or disqualifications.” Masson-Oursel rightly \nbelieves that magic preceded technique— in fact, that magic is the \nfirst expression of technique.\nPlainly, we have had two streams of technique from the very be­\nginning. How does it happen that we never take cognizance of the \nsecond? There are a number of reasons. We can leave aside the \ncauses that come from modem psychology. Because we are ob­\nsessed with materialism and do not take magic seriously, it has \nlittle interest for us, and we are unaware even today, as we study \ntechnique— the techniques that relate to men— that we are draw­\ning on the great stream of magical techniques.\nBut this neglect is due as well to objective causes: in relation to \npurely material factors, it has been demonstrated that every milieu \nresists imitating the techniques of another social or ethnic group. \nSurely, this resistance was much stronger in the realm of magical \ntechniques. Here were all the taboos and prohibitions, the im-"

Then, too, whereas ma­\nterial techniques are relatively distinct and independent of one \nanother, magical techniques are rapidly elaborated into a rigid \nsystem. Everything is of a piece, everything is dependent upon \neverything else; consequently, nothing can be meddled with, noth­\ning modified without threat to the whole structure of beliefs and \nactivities. Hence, their weak expansive power and their strong \npower of defense against alien magical techniques.\nThe realm of magical practice is limited, and there is little or no \ndiffusion. Propagation begins with “spiritualist” religions which are \nnot bound to special magical rites. There is, then, no possibility of \nchoice between different rival magical techniques; yet expansion \nand choice are decisive factors in technical progress. There is no \nreal progress in the realm of magic; here lies its fundamental dif­\nference. There is no progress in space, no progress in time; indeed, \nthe tendency of magic is to regress. And because magical technique \nis tied to one ethnic group, to one given form of civilization, it dis­\nappears completely when that group or civilization disappears.\nWhen a civilization dies, it transmits to its heirs its material but \nnot its spiritual apparatus. Tools, houses, and methods of manu­\nfacture live on and, more or less reincarnated, are to be met with \nagain. There may be a temporary material regression in periods of \ngreat destruction, but the lost ground is recovered, as if a collective \nhistorical memory made possible the recovery of what had been \nlost several generations before.

Since every technique is subordinate to its immediate result, \nit is only a question of choosing the one that produces the most \nsatisfactory result; and, in the material domain, that result can \nreadily be seen. That one form of axe is superior to another is a \njudgment not beyond a normal man (in spite of the extreme diffi­\nculty primitive man experienced when faced with such a choice). \nBut with magical techniques the same certainty or force of evi­\ndence does not exist. Who can judge their relative efficiency? \nMagical efficiency is not always to be measured by a clear material \nresult such as making rain fall, but may have to do with some \npurely spiritual phenomena or even with material phenomena \nover a long period of time. Here matters are not clear nor the choice \neasy; the difficulty becomes even more acute when we think about \nthe uncertainty of the reasons for failure. Was the magical tech­\nnique really inefficient? Or was the one who used it incompetent? \nThe common reaction is to blame the magician rather than the \ntechnique, and here again we see an element of immobility in \nmagic.\nThe two great streams of technique which we have traced from \ntheir beginnings evolved in completely different ways. In manual \ntechnique we observe an increase and later a multiplication of dis­\ncoveries, each based on the other. In magic we see only endless \nnew beginnings, as the fortunes of history and its own inefficiency \ncall its procedures into question.\nExplanation becomes even more difficult when we note that in \nthe magical domain too our own era has achieved an overwhelming \nsuperiority; our magical techniques have become really effective. \nThese techniques obviously must not be confused with religious \nlife or anything of that kind. This is purely a social phenomenon, \nboth in aim and in form. However, the two aspects of technique, \nalthough both are social, are sharply separated, and would seem \nto have interacted very little anywhere.\nGreece. Technique is essentially Oriental: it was principally in the \nNear East that technique first developed, and it had very little \nin the way of scientific foundation. It was entirely directed toward \npractical application and was not concerned with general theories, \nwhich alone can give rise to scientific movements. This predomi­\nnance of technique in the East points up an error which is found \nthroughout Western thought: that the Oriental mind is turned\n\f\n* 8 )  TECHNIQUES\ntoward the mystical and has no interest in concrete action, whereas \nthe Western mind is oriented toward \"know-how' and action, and \nhence toward technique. In fact, the East was the cradle of all \naction, of all past and primitive technique in the present sense of \nthe word, and later of spiritual and magical technique as well.\nThe Greeks, however, were the first to have a coherent scientific \nactivity and to liberate scientific thought. But then a phenomenon \noccurred which still astonishes historians: the almost total separa­\ntion of science and technique. Doubtless, this separation was less \nabsolute than the example of Archimedes has led historians to \nbelieve. But it is certain that material needs were treated with con­\ntempt, that technical research was considered unworthy of the in­\ntellect, and that the goal of science was not application but con­\ntemplation. Plato shunned any compromise with application, even \nin order to forward scientific research. For him, only the most ab­\nstract possible exercise of reason was important. Archimedes went \neven further. True, he rationalized practice and even made “appli­\ncations' to a certain degree; but his machine was to be destroyed \nafter it had demonstrated the exactness of his numerical reckon­\nings.\nWhy did the Greeks adopt this Malthusian attitude toward ac­\ntivity? There are two possible answers: either they were not willing \nor they were not able. And it is likely that both are true. Abel Rey \nhas devoted the fifth volume of his Science Technique to the \nGreeks. According to him, Greece in her decline became “in­\ncapable of sustaining the ideal of hard, disinterested labor (the \nideal of an essentially contemplative intelligence disdainful of all \nutility). She then fell back on the techniques of the East She \nwas involved in them by her own techniques, for she had none the \nless sought to satisfy men’s vital needs, in spite of the contempt in \nwhich she held them.” Confronted with technical necessity, Greece \nlost her inventive genius and turned to Eastern technique. She did \nnot know, says Abel Rey, how to find the bridge between “know­\nhow” and “know-why.”\nThis is true for the period of decadence, the second and first \ncenturies b.c., but it does not seem to be the case in the preceding \nperiod; in the fifth century B .C ., Greece experienced rapid technical \ndevelopment, although later it came to an abrupt halt.\nIn their golden age of science, the Greeks could have deduced\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( s$\nthe technical consequences of their scientific activity. But they did \nnot wish to. Walter asks: “Did the Creeks, obsessed with harmony, \ncheck themselves at the very point at which inquiry ran the risk of \ngoing to excess and threatened to introduce a monstrosity into their \ncivilization?\"\nThis was the result of a variety of factors, most of which were of \na philosophic nature. For one thing, theirs was a conception of life \nwhich scorned material needs and the improvement of practical \nlife, discredited manual labor (because of the practice of slavery), \nheld contemplation to be the goal of intellectual activity, refused \nthe use of power, respected natural things. The Greeks were \nsuspicious of technical activity because it represented an aspect of \nbrute force and implied a want of moderation. Man, however \nhumble his technical equipment, has from the very beginning \nplayed the role of sorcerer’s apprentice in relation to the machine. \nThis feeling on the part of the Greeks was not a reflection of a \nprimitive man’s fear in the face of something he does not under* \nstand (the explanation given today when certain persons take fright \nat our techniques). Rather, it was the result, perfectly mastered \nand perfectly measured, of a certain conception of life. It repre* \nsented an apex of civilization and intelligence.\nHere we find the supreme Greek virtue, iyp&r<t* (self-control). \nThe rejection of technique was a deliberate, positive activity in­\nvolving self-mastery, recognition of destiny, and the application of \na given conception of life. Only the most modest techniques were \npermitted— those which would respond directly to material needs \nin such a way that these needs did not get the upper hand.\nIn Greece a conscious effort was made to economize on means \nand to reduce the sphere of influence of technique. No one sought \nto apply scientific thought technically, because scientific thought \ncorresponded to a conception of life, to wisdom. The great pie- \noccupation of the Greeks was balance, harmony and moderation; \nhence, they fiercely resisted the unrestrained force inherent in \ntechnique, and rejected it because of its potentialities. For these \nsame reasons, magic had relatively little importance in Greece. \nRome. Social technique was still in its infancy. Doubtless, there \nhad been some attempts at social organization— those of certain \nPharaohs, and those of the Persian empire, were not neglibible. \nBut such organizations could be maintained only by police power.\n\f\nTECHNIQUES3 ° )\nwhereas the exact opposite is true of genuine social organization. \nBy the very fact of its existence, coercion demonstrates the ab­\nsence of political, administrative, and juridical technique; for this \nreason the great empires of the past are of little importance to our \nstudy. Correlatively, an army (even the army of the Chaldeans, \nwho advanced the art of war furthest) was a fairly inorganic crew \nwhose aim was pillage and which applied no social technique. The \narmy of Alexander made use of genuine strategy, but this was al­\nmost exclusively military and had no sociological foundations or \nattributes. It was the expression not of a people but of a state— and \ntherefore lacked the substance necessary to technique.\nIn Rome, however, we pass on, at one step, to the perfection of \nsocial technique, both civil and military. Everything in Roman so­\nciety was related to Roman law in its multiple forms, both public \nand private.\nTo characterize the technique of this law in the period during \nwhich it flourished (from the second century b.c. to the second \ncentury a.d.), we can say first of all that it was not the fruit of ab­\nstract thought, but rather of an exact view of the concrete situation, \nwhich the Romans attempted to turn to account with the fewest \npossible means. This realism respected justice and acknowledged \nhistory and necessity. From this concrete, experimental view, \nwhich the Romans held consciously, their administrative and judi­\ncial technique developed. And a kind of discipline appeared: the \nuse of a minimum of means. This discipline, which probably had \nits foundations in religion, is one of the secrets of the whole de­\nvelopment To the degree that the Roman had to respond to neces­\nsity, and at the same time not permit himself excessive luxury, it \nwas necessary to refinp every means, to bring it to perfection, to \nexploit it in every possible way, and to give it free rein, without \nshackling it with exceptions and secondary rules. No social situa­\ntion developed which did not immediately find its response in or­\nganization. Nor could this response be the creation of a new means, \nbut rather the perfection of an old means. Indeed, the proliferation \nof means is thought even today to denote technological weakness.\nA second element in the Roman development of organization \nwas the search for an equilibrium between the purely technical \nfactor and the human factor. Judicial technique did not begin as a \nsubstitute for man. In Roman judicial technique there was no\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 1\nquestion of eliminating initiative and responsibility, but rather of \nallowing them to operate and to assert themselves. It was not until \nthe third century a.d. that judicial technique attempted to deal \nwith the details of life, to regulate everything, to foresee everything, \nthereby leaving the individual in a state of complete inertia. But \nthe great judicial era of Rome was one of equilibrium: the law \nlaid down the framework and supplied the means that men could \nuse in following their own initiative. Of course, this presupposed \na civic sense corresponding to the technical conception. The \nequilibrium between the two was evident in the system of pro­\ncedure we call bureaucracy; in it is found, with an almost dis­\nconcerting simplicity, the perfect type of procedure. And there we \nfind that one of the conditions of technique is respect for the in- \ndividual, who is not yet considered apart from society.\nA third characteristic of Roman technique was that it was di­\nrected toward a precise end: the internal coherence of society. This \ntechnique was not self-justifying, it did not have as its raison d’etre \nits own self-development, and it was not imposed from the out­\nside. It was not a kind of scaffolding which held independent ele­\nments together; it sought rather to promote cohesion. The founda­\ntion of society was not the police; it was an organization which \nenabled society to make the least possible use of the police. A \nwide variety of techniques— religious, administrative, and finan­\ncial— were obviously needed to execute this design, but in no case \nwas there recourse to force. When it appeared that the state \nwould be compelled to use force, the organizational sense of the \nRomans led them to abandon a given project rather than attempt \nto maintain it by force. Force is never economical, and Rome was \neconomical in all things.\nThis social coherence was the first judicial technique the world \nhad knowa It was also the basis for the Roman military system, \nwhich was a direct expression of civil society in that it had the same \nrespect for efficiency and economy. From it came the development \nof organs of transport, food supply, and so on; and the Roman con­\nception of mass strategy and their refusal to create heroes: combat \nwas thus reduced to its most utilitarian level.\nA fourth element was continuity. The judicial technique of the \nRomans was constantly being readapted in accordance with a his­\ntorical plan. It involved a policy of watchful waiting while circum-\n\f\n3 * )  TECHNIQUES\nstances were not propitious, at the same time making preparations \nfor the right moment, and when that moment came, carrying out \nthe plan decisively.\nAs regards material techniques, the Romans did not develop \nthem as brilliantly. From the fourth to the first century b.c., and \nafter the second century a.d., there was almost total stagnation—  \ntools and armaments no longer evolved. But from the first century \nb.c. to the first century a.d., a technical revival took place. Practical \nnecessity (on the economic and military levels and with regard to \ntransport) was met by the production of animal-powered ma­\nchines (forges, water wheels, pumps, plows, the screw press, \ncord-operated ballistic engines, etc.).\nThe Romans possessed a remarkable understanding of applica­\nbility. Their judicial system could be applied always and every­\nwhere (in the Empire); it was adapted to an unfailing continuity. \nAnd these were totally new phenomena which Rome introduced. \nLater, Rome was allowed to drift into a technical vertigo; the end \nwas near.\nChristianity and Technique. The East: passive, fatalist, contemptu­\nous of life and action; the West: active, conquering, turning nature \nto profit. These contrasts, so dear to popular sociology, are said \nto result from a difference in religion: Buddhism and Islam on the \none hand; on the other, Christianity, which is credited with having \nforged the practical soul of the West.\nThese ideas are hardly beyond the level of the rote repetitions \nfound even in the works of serious historians. It is not for me to \nexamine religious doctrines in themselves or as absolute if unreal­\nized dogma, but rather to interpret them sociologically. After all, I \nam not writing theology; I am writing history. And there is a world \nof difference between dogma and its sociological application. (I \nshall not touch upon the personal interpretation of religion, which \nconcerns the relationship between the individual and God.)\nThis being the case, it is obvious that certain statements call for \nmodification. For example, the assertion that as a consequence of \nthe teachings of Mohammed, the Islamic conquests of the seventh \ncentury are evidence of passivism. This might also be said of the \ndetermined Islamic resistance to Western encroachments during \nthe last two centuries. We attribute to Buddhist indifferentism the \nremarkable artistic, political, and military development in India\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 3\nfrom the second to the fifth century. In fact, however, these civili­\nzations were little advanced technically, though they had de­\nveloped in many other areas.\nChristianity in Russia, on the other hand, gave rise to a mystical \ncivilization which was indifferent to material life and had no \ntechnical drive and no interest in economic exploitation. “Ah, yesl” \nis the reply. “But Christianity in Russia had Eastern overtones . . .” \nHere, then, indifference to technique would appear to be a ques­\ntion of temperament and not of religion.\nAnother embarrassing fact: when in her decline Greece applied \nherself to technical inquiry and the development of industry, she \nlooked to the East for methods. And in the first century, when \nRome— the perfect example of the technical spirit in antiquity—  \ntook up industry, she too turned to the East for industrial tech­\nniques— the refining of silver and gold, glassmaking, the tempering \nof weapons, pottery, ship construction, and so on. All these tech­\nniques came to Rome from the East, either early, through the \nEtruscans, or much later, after the conquests. We are far indeed \nfrom being able to support this traditional cleavage between East \nand West. In fact, during classical antiquity it was the East which \npossessed the concrete, inventive mind that gTasps the truth and \nexploits i t\nThe West is making a prodigious advance in technique at the \npresent, and the West is traditionally Christian. Nor can it be main­\ntained that Christianity is a negligible factor in that advance. How­\never, there were several distinct historical periods in the West The \nWest was officially Christian until the fourteenth century; there­\nafter, Christianity became controversial and was breached by other \ninfluences. What do we find, from a technical standpoint, in the \nso-called Christian era, the period from the fourth to the fourteenth \ncenturies, the “sociological moment”? First, we observe the break­\ndown of Roman technique in every area— on the level of organiza­\ntion as well as in the construction of cities, in industry, and in \ntransport From the fourth to the tenth centuries, in fact, there was \na complete obliteration of technique, a condition so deplored that \nit became a focus of anti-Christian polemic, and rightly so. It was \nbecause the Christians held judicial and other technical activity in \nsuch contempt that they were considered the “enemies of the hu­\nman race”— and not only because they opposed Caesar. The re-\n\f\nTECHNIQUES3 4 )\nproach of Celsus was not without truth. After the Christian triumph \nin Rome, there was not one great jurist left who could guarantee \nthe life and the value of the Roman organization. Decadence? No \n— complete disinterest in such activity. Saint Augustine devoted \nmuch of his De Civitate Dei to justifying the Christians in this \nrespect, and to denying that their influence was detrimental. \"They \nare good citizens,\" he proclaimed. That may have been so, but \ntheir focus of interest was nevertheless on something other than \nthe state and practical activity. I shall show later on that the \ntechnical state of mind is one of the principal causes of technical \nprogress.\nIt is not a coincidence that Rome declined as Christianity tri­\numphed. The Emperor Julian was certainly justified in accusing \nthe Christians of ruining the industry of the Empire.\nAfter this period of decadence (for which, of course, Christianity \nwas not solely responsible), what does the historian find? The res­\ntoration, under Christian influence, of an active civilization—  \nmethodical, exploiting the riches of the world as a gift given by \nGod to be put to good use? Not at alL The society which developed \nfrom the tenth to the fourteenth century was vital, coherent, and \nunanimous; but it was characterized by a total absence of the tech­\nnical will. It was “a-capitalistic” as well as “a-technical.”\nFrom the point of view of organization, it was an anarchy in the \netymological sense of the word— and it was completely nontechni­\ncal. Its law was principally based on custom. It had no social or \npolitical organization based on reasoned, elaborated rules. In all \nother areas— for example, in agriculture and industry— there was \nthe same nearly total absence of technique. This was also true with \nregard to the military,, the principal activity of the time. Combat \nwas reduced to its most elementary— to charging in a straight line \nand to hand-to-hand engagement. Only architectural technique \ndeveloped and asserted itself; but this was prompted not by a \ntechnical state of mind but by religious impulse.\nLittle effort was made to improve agricultural or industrial prac­\ntices. There was no effort at useful creation— evidence of the re­\nmarkable practical genius of the Christian religion! And when at \nthe beginning of the twelfth century, at first very feebly a technical \nmovement began to take form, it developed under the influence of \nthe East.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3  5\nThe technical impetus of our civilization came from the East, at \nfirst through the intermediacy of the Judaei’ and the Venetians, \nand later through the Crusades. But even so, it limited itself to \nimitating what it had seen— except in art Certain autonomous dis­\ncoveries did take place, especially as a result of commercial neces­\nsity; but this development was no more intense than it had been \nunder the Roman Empire.\nIn fact, the Middle Ages created only one new, complete tech­\nnique, an intellectual technique, a mode of reasoning: scholasti­\ncism. The very name evokes its mediocrity. With its gigantic ap­\nparatus, it was in the end nothing but an extremely cumbersome \nformalism; it wandered for centuries in intellectual blind alleys, \nnotwithstanding the prodigious intellects of the men who used it \nand were deformed by i t  The halance sheet shows no triumphs, \neven on the historical plane.\nThe technical movement of the West developed in a world which \nhad already withdrawn from the dominant influence of Christian­\nity. A point can doubtless be made of the effects of the Reformation, \nbut the economic consequences of this movement have been singu­\nlarly exaggerated. In any case, this is not the place to take up this \nquestion.\nAlthough, practically speaking, it seems clear that Christianity \nwas scarcely an important cause of technical progress (not to men­\ntion regression), it is nevertheless customary to hold that Chris­\ntianity, from the theological point of view, paved the way for \ntechnical development.\nLet us consider the two arguments advanced for this point of \nview. First, and most important, it is held that Christianity sup­\npressed slavery, the great obstacle to technical development. The \nmoment men are free, they supposedly tum toward technique to be \ndelivered from the misery of labor. Slavery was thus a hindrance \nto technique because no attempt was made either to relieve the \nmiserable condition of the slave or to replace him by some other \nmotive force. The second argument is more intelligent: that an­\ntiquity was possessed of a holy fear of nature, and dared not lay \nhand on the secrets which to the ancients were gods. They dared \nnot make use of natural forces, which for them were supernatural.\nA  particular kind o f trader. (Trans.)\n\f\nTECHNIQUES36)\nChristianity secularized nature: with Christianity nature once \nagain became simply nature and no one scrupled to exploit it. \nUnfortunately, however, neither of these arguments is quite ac- \ncurate.\nThere was in fact greater technical progress in civilizations where \nslavery was prevalent ( for example, Egypt) than in others where \nthat institution was practically unknown (for example, Israel). \nThere was greater technical progress in the slaveholding period of \nRoman history than in the period when slaves were freed whole­\nsale. And the liberation of the slaves during the era of the barbarian \ninvasions produced no technical improvement, even at long term; \nalmost seven centuries elapsed between the suppression of slavery \nand the beginning of even a feeble technical advance. The rela­\ntion between technique and the absence of slavery is in no sense \nabsolute; as Bertrand Cille has rightly pointed out, human trans­\nport by means of slaves was not known in Roman antiquity; yet \nthe harnessing of animals had not been developed.\nWe have here one of those facile, impressive, and altogether \nantihistorical explanations which theorists are so fond of. The \nslave, in fact, represented capital which it was not in the owner’s \ninterest to lose or to use haphazardly. And, as the elder Cato indi­\ncates, had it been possible to make the slave’s labor more efficient \nand less fatiguing, his master had every interest in doing so. More­\nover, it did not cost anything to make use of the free men who lived \non the vast domains of the public treasury or the limes or the \nMarches,* and later, on the ecclesiastical and seignorial lands. \nCertainly, it was not respect for human life which prompted the \nRomans to spare these people. And the people themselves scarcely \npossessed the freedom of mind or the material possibilities to im­\nprove their techniques. Cille has shown admirably that in Athens \nthe Greek slaves may have had greater value than the free work­\nmen.\nThe second argument is no more applicable. It is true that Chris­\ntianity secularized nature. But did this benefit technique? We \nhave noted, in passing, the religious origin of many forms of tech­\nnique; indeed, nature, as the theater of spiritual forces, gives rise \nto one particular teclinique already mentioned: magic.

The \nrepresentation of nature as inhabited by the gods was itself a \npotent act, and favorable, if not to all applications, certainly to \ntechnique itself. Taboos applied only to certain concrete applica­\ntions which were determined by ideas of right and wrong. Man \nthus felt that his actions were justified by the help given him by \nthe gods of nature. Christianity, however, deprived him of this \njustification.\nWhat was the doctrinal position of early Christianity regarding \npractical activity, from the very beginning? On the moral plane, \nChristianity condemned luxury and money— in short, everything \nthat represented the earthly city, which was consecrated to Satan \nand opposed to the City of God. This was the era of the anchorite, \nof the renunciation of city life, of cenobitism presented as an ideal. \nThe tendency was toward the restriction of economic life. On the \ntheological plane, there was the conviction that the world was ap­\nproaching its end, that it was useless to strive to develop or cultivate \nit, for the Lord was soon to return. It was wiser to be concerned \nwith eschatology than with worldly affairs.\nAt the beginning of the medieval period, these doctrines lost \nsome of their hold (although they persisted under other guises—  \nthe feeling about death, for instance). But another element of \nChristianity remained which was opposed to technical develop­\nment: the moral judgment which Christians passed an all human \nactivities.\nTechnical activity did not escape Christian moral judgment The \nquestion “Is it righteous?” was asked of every attempt to change \nmodes of production or of organization. That something might be \nuseful or profitable to men did not make it right and just. It had to \nfit a precise conception of justice before Cod. When an element \nof technique appeared to be righteous from every point of view, \nit was adopted, but even then with excessive caution. Only inven­\ntions (representing a choice among techniques made by individ­\nuals versed in Greek or Latin) judged worthy were applied or \neven allowed to become known. It was within this narrow compass \nthat certain monks propagated and improved technical instru­\nments. The spread of the hydraulic mill by the Cistercians is well \nknown; likewise the many specialized mills to be found at the\n\f\nTECHNIQUES38 )\nAbbey of Royaumont (the smith’s mill, the fuller's mill, etc.). But \nthese exceptions were few.\nThe search for justice before God, the measuring of technique \nby other criteria than those of technique itself— these were the \ngreat obstacles that Christianity opposed to technical progress. \nThey operated in the Middle Ages in all areas of life, and made \nhistory coincide with theology.\nThe age of the Reformation, in its effort to return to the most \nprimitive conception of Christianity, broke down many barriers. \nBut, even then, it was not so much from the influence of the new \ntheology as from the shock of the Renaissance, from humanism \nand the authoritarian state, that technique received a decisive im­\npetus.\nThe Sixteenth Century. In the period from the sixteenth to the \neighteenth century the absence of technique in all areas but the \nmechanical is striking. There was an absence of human reasoning \nconcerning action, of efforts directed toward simplification and \nsystematization, and of concern for efficiency. Certain important \ntechnical achievements were made— for example, guns and gun \nfactories— and there was some agricultural research. But it is sig­\nnificant that histories of technique (Pierre Ducasse’s, for ex­\nample) leap from the Middle Ages to the end of the eighteenth \ncentury. Indeed, the period which followed the Renaissance and \nthe Reformation was much less fertile in invention than the period \nwhichhad preceded them.\nPrinting, the nautical compass, gunpowder (also copied from \nthe East), all date from the fifteenth century. It would not do to \nminimize the importance of these inventions. For Norbert Wiener, \nthey “constitute the locus of an industrial revolution which pre­\nceded the principal industrial revolution.” Wiener, in a remarkable \nway, relates the principal inventions of this period to navigation, \nwhich, he proposes, was the propulsive force behind research. \nAlongside these major inventions, this period also saw a multitude \nof discoveries and new applications in banking, armaments, ma­\nchinery, architecture (for example, the discovery of a new system \nfor constructing the dome, as applied to Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs), \nand in agriculture and the making of furniture.\nThe fifteenth century, in addition, is notable for a number of \ntechnical manuals from southern Germany and northern Italy\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 3 9\n( written at the beginning of the century and printed and circulated \nat the end of it). These show a general interest in these problems, a \ntechnical preoccupation on the part of the men of the times. The \ngreat voyages were probably a consequence rather than a cause of \nthis technical progress.\nBut this technical drive slackened during the sixteenth century, \nwhich became poorer and poorer in technique, and technical weak­\nness persisted through the seventeenth century and into the be­\nginning of the eighteenth. This poverty of technical achievement, \nwhich lasted two centuries, leads us once more to question the \ninfluence of the Reformation. What caused this slowdown of tech­\nnical progress after the fifteenth century, which had been so rich \nin discoveries of all kinds?\nAn uninitiated reader who opens a scientific treatise on law, econ­\nomy, medicine, or history published between the sixteenth and the \neighteenth centuries is struck most forcibly by the complete ab­\nsence of logical order. The materials are treated successively with­\nout any connection, progression of thought, development, or show \nof proof. The reader is apparently to be guided only by the au­\nthor’s fancy. Every chapter in a scientific work, say, of the sixteenth \ncentury, is a self-contained unit which justifies and proves itself. \nA mere affirmation by the author generally serves as proof. And he \nlets himself go in a free association of ideas which are in no way \npertinent to the subject; his thoughts often wend off to matters \ncompletely unconnected with the subject of the book.\nPurely personal reflection and private experience form the foun­\ndations of these books; in no sense do they represent an effort at \ncommon inquiry, reciprocal control, or search for the best method, \nall of which are indispensable for technique. The plan of a book \nwas not laid out with the reader in mind; it was not based on \nsubject matter, but rather on the personal fancy of the author, or \non more obscure reasonings. Even men of powerful intellect such \nas Jean Bodin did not escape these failings.\nA second characteristic of this scientific literature is that it at­\ntempts to set down in one book the whole realm of knowledge. It \nis not rare to find, in works on law in the sixteenth or seventeenth \ncenturies, extended treatments of archaeology, theology, psy­\nchology, and linguistics, not to mention history and literature. En­\ntire chapters concerned with magical practices or Peruvian soci-\n\f\nTECHNIQUES40)\nology may interrupt the course of a book devoted to revenues or to \nthe jurisprudence of the Parliament of Bordeaux.\nThis amalgam of reflections and miscellaneous bits of knowledge \nis found in the works of the best authors; it demonstrates the ab­\nsence of intellectual specialization. The intellectual ideal was uni­\nversality, and it was a rare thing for a judge, say, to be ignorant \nof alchemy, or a historian, of medicine. This was, in effect, an \nextension by humanism of the universalism to which medieval \ntheology aspired.\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries every intellectual had \nperforce to be a universalist. He had to have complete knowledge, \nand when he wrote on a given subject he felt constrained to put \ninto the work everything he knew, pertinent or not. This was by \nno means a sign of muddleheadedness but rather of the prevailing \nsearch for a synthesized, universal system of knowledge. Every \nauthor sought to put his whole self into his work, even in the case \nof a technical book. Not the subject but the author dominated the \nwork: this tendency itself is contrary to technical inquiry. The \nsearch was not for practical knowledge but for a comprehensive \nexplication of phenomena. Thus Descartes, after having established \nan impeccable method of reasoning, gives himself over to the out­\npourings of his imagination in order to explain— to take a single \nexample— the movements of the tides.\nThis explains another characteristic of the hooks written after \nthe century of humanism: their lack of convenience. We find few \ntables of contents, no references, no division into sections, no \nindices, no chronology, sometimes not even pagination. The ap­\nparatus standard for scientific works today is not found even rudi- \nmentarily in the most perfect works of the period; and its absence \nis characteristic of the absence of intellectual technique. The books \nof the time were not written to be used, along with hundreds of \nothers, to locate a piece of information accurately and quickly, or \nto validate or invalidate an experiment, or to furnish a formula. \nThey were not written to be consulted. They were written to be \nread patiently in their entirety and to be meditated upon. Again, \nthis goes back to the ideal of universality.\nThe presentation of a book as an author’s entire self, as a per­\nsonal expression of his very being, supposes that the reader sought \nin it not the solution of a given difficulty or the answer to a given\n\f\nThe Technological Society (41\nproblem, but rather to make personal contact with the author. It \nwas more a question of a personal exchange than of taking an ob­\njective position. ‘\nThis applies to every other field of endeavor until the eighteenth \ncentury. Thus, in the simpjest technical form, the mechanical, no \ndecisive progress was made during this time ( unless Pascal were to \nbe considered the sole exception; but even Pascal merely extended \nalready known techniques). The same holds true for financial, ad­\nministrative, and military techniques, in spite of what Vauban says \nto the contrary.\nThen an intermediate situation developed. But despite the efforts \nat co-ordination and systematization made by such great techni­\ncians as Richelieu and Colbert, the only result was a greater com­\nplication of tire system, without much gain in efficiency. On the ad­\nministrative and political level, all the new organs (each valuable \nin itself and without doubt efficient, but representing only an addi­\ntion to what already existed) had to take into consideration every \nother organ already functioning in the same field. New complicated \ndepartments, jurisdictions, and hierarchies unceasingly weighed \ndown the machinery. On the financial plane, the same monstrous \ngrowth occurred— for valid reasons— but it resulted in enfeeble- \nment beneath a seeming efficiency. There was no change in finan­\ncial technique, in spite of all the efforts of Colbert, who saw what \nshould be done. There was no change in the technique of recruit­\nment, supply, and administration of the army, in spite of the efforts \nof Louvois, who saw just as clearly what had to be done. Louis XIV \nwas an impotent monarch, despite his authority, because of the \nabsence of technical means.\nSociety was at a crossroads. More and more the need was felt to \ncreate new means; even the structure these must take was clearly \nperceived. But the framework of society, the ideas in currency, the \nintellectual positions of the day were not favorable to their realiza­\ntion. It was necessary to employ technical means in a framework \nforeign to them; these techniques were powerless to force a deci­\nsion or to eliminate outmoded means. They ran up against the \nprofound humanism, issue of Renaissance humanism, which still \nhaunted the seventeenth century— it believed not only in knowl­\nedge and respect for the human being but in the genuine su­\npremacy of man over means. This humanism, bound up with the\n\f\n42) TECHNIQUES\nidea of universalism, did not allow techniques to grow. Men re­\nfused to conform to any uniform law, even when it operated for \ntheir own good. This refusal was found in all strata of society: in \nthe most complex way when finance directors and parliamentary \ncounselors refused to utilize new and precise techniques of ac­\ncounting and legislative supremacy; in the most summary way \nwhen the peasants rejected new and rational methods of recruit­\nment proposed for the army.\nThe world had to wait for the eighteenth century to see techni­\ncal progress suddenly explode in every country and in every area \nof human endeavor.\nThe Industrial Revolution. The term industrial revolution is ap­\nplied exclusively to the development of machinery, but that is to \nsee only one side of it. In actual fact, the industrial revolution was \nmerely one aspect of the technical revolution. It is preposterous \nthat a specialist such as Lewis Mumford can write that he has found \nin the various modes of exploiting energy the key to the evolution \nof technique and the moving force behind its transformations. In \nhis view, a first period, which lasted until about 1750, knew only \nhydraulic energy; a second period, from 1750 to 1880, is the age \nof coal; and a third, that of electricity. (The use of nuclear energy \nhas only recently appeared; it is perhaps to be reckoned as part \nof the age of electricity.)\nMumford’s thesis is incomprehensible unless technique is re­\nstricted to the machine; Mumford actually makes this identifica­\ntion. His distinction is then valid as a plan for the historical study \nof machines, but it is totally invalid for the study of technical \ncivilization. When technical civilization is considered as a whole, \nthis classification and explanation are shockingly surr.rr.a ry and \nsuperficial. Norbert Wiener likewise rejects tbe classification \nfounded on the different sources of energy. For him there has been \nonly one industrial revolution, and that consisted in the replace­\nment of human muscle as a source of energy. And, he adds, there \nis a second revolution in the making whose object is the replace­\nment of the human brain. Of this last we have as yet only prepara­\ntions and indications. W e are not yet there. What we are witnessing \nat the moment is a rearrangement of the world in an intermediate \nstage; the change is not in the use of a natural force but in the \napplication of technique to all spheres of life.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (43\nThe technical revolution meant the emergence of a state that was \ntruly conscious of itself and was autonomous in relation to anything \nthat did not serve its interests— a product of the French Revolu­\ntion, It entailed the creation of a precise military technique ( Fred­\nerick the Great and Napoleon) in the field of strategy and in the \nfields of organization, logistics, and recruitment; the beginning of \neconomic technique with the physiocrats, and later the liberals. In \nadministration and police power, it was the period of rationalized \nsystems, unified hierarchies, card indices, and regular reports. \nW ith Napoleon particularly, there was a tendency toward mecha­\nnization which resulted from the application of technique to more \nor less human spheres of action.\nThe revolution also entailed the exertion and the regrouping of \nall the national energies. There were to be no more loafers (under \nthe French Revolution, they were imprisoned), no more privileged \npersons, no special interests. Everyone must serve in accordance \nwith the strictures of technique.\nFrom the judicial point of view, the technical revolution entailed \nthe great systematization of law in the Napoleonic codes and the \ndefinitive suppression of spontaneous sources of law; for example, \ncustom. It involved the unification of legal institutions under the \niron rule of the state and the submission of law to policy. And \nthroughout Europe, except in Great Britain, the nations, amazed \nby such an efficient operation, abandoned their traditional judicial \nsystems in favor of the state.\nThis systematization, unification, and clarification was applied \nto everything— it resulted not only in the establishment of budget­\nary rules and in fiscal organization, but in the systematization of \nweights and measures and the planning of roads. All this repre­\nsented technique at work. From this point of view, it might be said \nthat technique is the translation into action of man s concern to \nmaster things by means of reason, to account for what is subcon­\nscious, make quantitative what is qualitative, make clear and pre­\ncise the outlines of nature, take hold of chaos and put order into it.\nIn intellectual activity the same effort was evident, particularly in \nthe creation of an intellectual technique for history and biology. \nThe principles established by Descartes were applied and resulted \nnot only in a philosophy but in an intellectual technique.\nThese phenomena are so far from being sources of energy that it\n\f\n44) TECHNIQUES\ncan scarcely be maintained that mechanical transformation \nbrought about all the rest. In fact, the widespread mechanical de­\nvelopment, spurred by the exploitation of energy, came after most \nof these other techniques. It would almost seem that the order was \nreversed, that the appearance of these other techniques was nec­\nessary to the evolution of the machine— which certainly had no \ngreater influence on society than, say, the organization of the \npolice.\nThe revolution resulted not from the exploitation of coal but \nrather from a change of attitude on the part of the whole civiliza­\ntion. Here we are faced with a most difficult question: Why, after \nsuch slow progress for centuries, did such an eruption of technical \nprogress take place in a century and a half? Why, at a certain \nmoment in history, did something become possible which had not \nseemed possible before? We must confess that the ultimate reason \nescapes us. Why did inventions suddenly burst forth in the second \nhalf of the eighteenth century? We cannot say. Here we are at the \ncenter of the mystery of invention, which strangely came to life for \nthis brief moment.\nThe inventions of the nineteenth century are much more easily \nexplained. A kind of chain reaction was set up: the discoveries \nmade at the beginning of the century generated those that followed. \nThere was a logical and foreseeable succession of events, once the \nfirst steps had been taken.\nBut why were the first steps taken? We will never know, and, in \nany case, that is not the purpose of this investigation. We ask \nrather why technical inventions have proliferated so radically and \ndeveloped to the point where they threaten to engulf society. Why \ndid the limitless applicability of the sciences become a reality \nwhen hitherto it had been restrained and equivocal? The Greeks \nknew that machines could be utilized; why did it devolve upon the \nnineteenth century to utilize them? The question, indeed, is why \nthe nineteenth century not only made applications but did so on \nsuch a grand scale. Leonardo da Vinci' invented a prodigious num­\nber of useful devices (the alarm clock, the silk-winder, a machine \nfor carding textile fabrics, and so on), and proposed many technical \nimprovements (double-hulled ships, the universal joint, conical \ngears, etc.). Why did none of his inventions and improvements \nfind practical application?\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 4 5\nThere are a number of general answers. One can relate everything \nto scientific progress, for example. The eighteenth and nineteenth \ncenturies saw advances in application, not in pure knowledge or in \nspeculation. It is useless to recount the scientific evolution of this \nperiod or to enumerate the sensational series of principles and laws \nformulated and applied at this time. Parenthetically, it might be \nnoted that the scientific revolution began as early as the first half \nof the seventeenth century. Experiments were then performed to \nprove the exactness of quantitative hypotheses. Moreover, a psy­\nchological transformation occurred which led to the consideration \nof phenomena as worthy of study in themselves. This prepared the \nway for technical progress, but it cannot explain it. These scientific \ndiscoveries represent necessary conditions— but not imperatives. \nIt is evident that applications are impossible without principles, but, \nonce principles have been established, applications do not neces­\nsarily follow. Applications may be made out of simple curiosity, as \namong the Creeks or among the makers of automatons in the \neighteenth century. (These automatons were not without experi­\nmental value. Research in cybernetics today likewise ends in the \nmaking of automatons.)\nThe close link between scientific research and technical inven­\ntion appears to be a new factor in the nineteenth century. Accord­\ning to Mumford, “the principal initiatives came, not from the \ninventor-engineer, but from the scientist who established the gen­\neral law.\" The scientist took cognizance both of the new raw ma­\nterials which were available and of the new human needs which \nhad to be met Then he deliberately oriented his research toward a \nscientific discovery that could be applied technically. And he did \nthis either out of simple curiosity or because of definite commercial \nand industrial demands. Pasteur, for instance, was encouraged in \nhis bacteriological research by wine producers and silkworm grow­\ners.\nIn the twentieth century, this relationship between scientific re­\nsearch and technical invention resulted in the enslavement of \nscience to technique. In the nineteenth century, however, science \nwas still the determining cause of technical progress. The society of \nthe eighteenth century was not yet mature enough to allow the sys­\ntematic development of inventions. As Siegfried Giedion says, the \nFrance of that period was a testing ground. Ideas proliferated but\n\f\n46) TECHNIQUES\ncould take no final form until society had undergone a transforma­\ntion.\nWhat distinguishes the eighteenth century is that applications \nwere made for reasons of utility; soon the only justification of science \nwas applicability. Most historians of technique content themselves \nwith invoking philosophy to explain this.\nThe philosophy of the eighteenth century did indeed favor tech­\nnical applications. It was naturalistic and sought not only to know \nbut also to exploit nature. It was utilitarian and pragmatic. It con­\ncerned itself with easing human life, with bringing more pleasure \ninto it and simplifying its labor. For the eighteenth century, man’s \nlife was narrowly confined to the material; it seemed evident that \nthe problem of life would be resolved when men were able to work \nless while consuming more. The goal of science thus appeared to \nbe fixed by philosophy.\nThis philosophy was concrete; it was bound up with material re­\nsults. What cannot be seen cannot be judged, and this explains this \ncentury’s judgment of history: that tbe foundation of civilizations \nis technique, not philosophy or religion.\nFor these admirable philosophers, technique had the enormous \nsuperiority of manifesting itself in a concrete way and of leaving its \ntracks for all to read. Voltaire and Diderot were its principal ex­\nponents. But I am unable to give this philosophy the highest place \nin the history of the development of techniques. It played a role, \nbut it was not the prime force behind the technical movement. \nTo say it was would be to exaggerate the force of these philosophic \nideas and systems, which affected only a small minority of French­\nmen and a minute elite abroad. The technical movement was a \nEurovean movement; the ideas of these philosophic minorities \ncould scarcely have penetrated Europe in such a way as to make \nevident to everyone the excellence of technical progress. We have \nonly to recall popular reactions to machinery— for example, to \nVaucanson’s loom, to the first steamboat, and to the first blast fur­\nnaces. These philosophic ideas scarcely suffice to explain the re­\nmarkable mobilization of all human forces in the nineteenth cen­\ntury.\nIt is even questionable whether this philosophy was universally \naccepted. At other times there have been utilitarian currents in \nphilosophy, but they represented only one branch of philosophy\n\f\nThe Technological Society (4 7\namong several and did not lead to such a radical transformation of \nsociety.\nThe optimistic atmosphere of the eighteenth century, more than \nthis philosophy, created a climate favorable to the rise of technical \napplications. The fear of evil diminished. There was an improve­\nment in manners; a softening of the conditions of war; an increasing \nsense of man’s responsibility for his fellows; a certain delight in \nlife, which was greatly increased by the improvement of living \nconditions in nearly all classes except the artisan; the building of \nfine houses in great numbers. All these helped persuade Europeans \nthat progress could only be achieved by the exploitation of natural \nresources and the application of scientific discoveries.\nThis state of mind created, in the second half of the eighteenth \ncentury, a land of good conscience on the part of scientists who de­\nvoted their research to practical objectives. They believed that hap­\npiness and justice would result from their investigations; and it is \nhere that the myth of progress had its beginning.\nIt is clear that this atmosphere was favorable to technical de­\nvelopment. But, in itself, it was not enough. How, then, are we to \nexplain the sudden blossoming of technique in the nineteenth cen­\ntury? (The eighteenth century was only the preliminary phase of \ntechnical application; the nineteenth century is the really interest­\ning period.) I feel that this transformation of civilization can be \nexplained by the conjunction in time of five phenomena: the frui­\ntion of a long technical experience; population expansion; the suit­\nability of the economic environment; the plasticity of the social \nmilieu; and the appearance of a clear technical intention.\nThe first of these factors must not be neglected: every modem \ntechnical application had ancestors. Arthur Vierendeel and Lewis \nMumford have analyzed these preparations. Every invention has \nits roots in a preceding technical period, and every period bears in \nitself “not only the trivial residue but also the valuable survivals of \npast technologies, and the nuclei of new ones.” What appears to be \ngenuinely new is the formation of a “technical complex,” which, ac­\ncording to Mumford, consists of a series of partial inventions that \ncombine into an ensemble. This unit begins to function when the \ngreatest number of its constituents have been assembled, and its \ntrend is toward continuous self-perfection. From 1000 -to about \n1750, there had been a slow fermentation which had no immediate\n\f\nTECHNIQUES4 « )\nconsequences but which had amassed materials in every area of \nlife. They had only to be drawn on for the technical miracle to take \nplace. This continuity has been analyzed by Vierendeel in particu­\nlar; and Wiener emphasizes it when he writes; “It is interesting to \nreflect on the fact that every tool possesses a genealogy and is the \nresult of the took which served to make it.” This enormous sum of \nexperiments, of apparatus, of inquiries was put to use abruptly at \nthe end of an evolutionary period which had lasted for nearly ten \ncenturies without social catastrophe. Continuity of this kind was \nimportant because it made unnecessary the transmission of the \ntechnical legacy from one civilization to another, an operation \nwhich inevitably involves the loss of a part of it, especially a part \nof the social forces that apply to nontechnical areas. This continuity \nis found in all fields of technique, from finance to transport If \ntechnical progress does not appear at a given moment, it is only \nbecause the social milieu is not completely favorable. But it is \nripening underground; it k  self-perpetuating even while it k  dor­\nmant, as in the seventeenth century. This long preparation was \nnecessary as support and foundation for the structure the nine­\nteenth century was to build; it represented what Charles Moraz6 \nin his Essai sur la civilisation dOccident calk “collective incuba­\ntion,” This incubation, consisting of millions of accumulated ex­\nperiments, was the preparation for the moment of formulation, of \nexpression.\nA second factor was equally necessary: the population expansion. \nHere again we find ourselves face to face with a familiar problem. \nFor two decades population studies in relation to the development \nof civilization have demonstrated that there is a close link between \ntechnique and population: the growth of population entails a \ngrowth of needs which cannot be satisfied except by technical de­\nvelopment. From another viewpoint, a population expansion offers \nfavorable grounds for research and technical growth by furnishing \nnot only the necessary market but also the requisite human ma­\nterial.\nThe third condition has been analyzed by Vincent. If technical \nprogress is to take place, the economic milieu must combine two \napparently contradictory traits: it must be at once stable and in \nflux. The foundations of economic life must be stable so that \nprimary technical research can be devoted to well-defined objects\n\f\nThe Technological Society (49\nand situations. But at the same time this milieu must be capable of \ngreat change, so that technical inventions can be absorbed into the \neconomy, and research stimulated. A rigid economy brings with it \nfixed customs which stifle the inventive faculty. Studies of the eco­\nnomic situation in the second half of the eighteenth century show \nthat it had precisely these two opposed characteristics. But this is \nwell known. I shall do no more than point it out and shall devote \ngreater space to the last two conditions, which are usually neg­\nlected.\nThe fourth condition is possibly the most decisive. It is the \nplasticity of the social milieu, which involves two factors: the dis­\nappearance of social taboos and the disappearance of natural social \ngroups.\nThe first of these appears in various forms, depending on the \nsociety involved. In the Western civilization of the eighteenth cen­\ntury there are two large categories: the taboos resulting from \nChristianity, and sociological taboos. The first category takes in all \nreligious and moral ideas, judgments concerning action, the prevail­\ning conception of man, and the ends proposed for human life. \nThese were, theoretically and factually, opposed to technical de­\nvelopment. When faith had been translated into prejudice and \nideology, and personal religious experience incorporated into a so­\ncial institution, a hardening of moral positions took place which \ncorresponded to the creation of genuine taboos. The natural order \nmust not be tampered with and anything new must be submitted \nto a moral judgment— which meant an unfavorable prejudgment. \nThis was the popular mentality created by Christianity, particu­\nlarly during the seventeenth century. Closely related to these were \nsociological taboos, in particular the conviction that a natural \nhierarchy exists which nothing can modify. The position of the \nnobility and the clergy, and above all of the king, could not be \nquestioned. When in the middle of the eighteenth century these be­\ngan to be questioned, the reaction of the people was that sacrilege \nwas being committed; the stupor that accompanied the execution \nof Louis XVI was a religious stupor. In fact, regicide was seen as \ndeicide. This constitution of society, which everyone relied on and \nrecognized as the only one possible, was an obstacle to technique \nwithin it; technique was held to be fundamentally sacrilegious. \nThe natural hierarchy operated against the practice of the mechani-\n\f\nTECHNIQUESS o )\ncal arts, which would only bring conveniences to the lower \nclasses. And since the lower classes too believed in the natural \nhierarchy, they could only be submissive and passive; they did not \ntry to better their lot. The important point here was not the reality \nof the facts or the existence of the hierarchy; it was belief in its \nnatural and sacred character which stood in the way of technique.\nThe very structure of society— based on natural groups— was \nalso an obstacle. Families were closely organized. The guilds and \nthe groups formed by collective interests (for example, the Uni­\nversity, the Parliament, the Confraternities and Hospitals) were \ndistinct and independent. The individual found livelihood, patron­\nage, security, and intellectual and moral satisfactions in collectives \nthat were strong enough to answer all his needs but limited enough \nnot to make him feel submerged or lost. They sufficed to satisfy \nthe average man who does not try to gratify imaginary needs if \nhis position is fairly stable, who opposes innovation if he lives in a \nbalanced milieu, even though he is poor. This fact, which is so \nsalient in the three millennia of history we know, is misunderstood \nby modern man, who does not know what a balanced social en­\nvironment is and the good he could derive from it.\nMan himself may feel less need to improve his condition. In ad­\ndition, the very existence of natural groups is an obstacle to the \npropagation of technical invention. For primitive peoples, inven­\ntion spreads in certain geographical areas within certain groups \naccording to existing social bonds. Exterior diffusion, however, the \ncrossing of a sociological frontier, is extremely difficult. This phe­\nnomenon exists in every society. Division into closely constituted \ngroups is an obstacle to the propagation of inventions. The same \nholds for guilds. Guilds act not only spontaneously and as socio­\nlogical units, but also voluntarily and according to the lawful con­\nstitution of each. This is also true of religious groups. Consider, for \nexample, the manufacturing secrets jealously guarded by the \nFrench Protestants in the seventeenth century. The diffusion of \nevery technique tends to be checked by these social divisions.\nThese obstacles disappeared at the time of the French Revolu­\ntion, in 1789. With the disappearance of religious and social taboos \ncame the creation of new religions, the affirmation of philosophic \nmaterialism, the suppression of the various hierarchies, regicide, \nand the struggle against the clergy. These factors acted powerfully\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 5 1\nupon the popular consciousness and contributed to the collapse of \nthe belief in these taboos.\nAt the same time (and this is the second factor which made for \nthe plasticity of the social milieu) a systematic campaign was \nwaged against all natural groups, under the guise of a defense of \nthe rights of the individual; for example, the guilds, the com­\nmunes, and federalism were attacked, this last by the Girondists. \nThere were movements against the religious orders and against the \nprivileges of Parliament, the Universities, and the Hospitalers. \nThere was to be no liberty of groups, only that of the individual. \nThere was likewise a struggle to undermine the family. Revolu­\ntionary legislation promoted its disintegration; it had already been \nshaken by the philosophy and the fervors of the eighteenth century. \nRevolutionary laws governing divorce, inheritance, and paternal \nauthority were disastrous for the family unit, to the benefit of the \nindividual. And these effects were permanent, in spite of temporary \nsetbacks. Society was already atomized and would be atomized \nmore and more. The individual remained the sole sociological unit, \nbut, far from assuring him freedom, this fact provoked the worst \nkind of slavery.\nThe atomization we have been discussing conferred on society \nthe greatest possible plasticity— a decisive condition for technique. \nThe breakup of social groups engendered the enormous displace­\nment of people at the beginning of the nineteenth century and \nresulted in the concentration of population demanded by modem \ntechnique. To uproot men from their surroundings, from the rural \ndistricts and from family and friends, in order to crowd them into \ncities still too small for them; to squeeze thousands into unfit lodg­\nings and unhealthy places of work; to create a whole new environ­\nment within the framework of a new human condition (it is too \noften overlooked that the proletariat is the creation of the indus­\ntrial machine)— all this was possible only when the individual was \ncompletely isolated. It was conceivable only when he literally had \nno environment, no family, and was not part of a group able to \nresist economic pressure; when he had almost no way of life left.\nSuch is the influence of social plasticity. Without it, no technical \nevolution is possible. For the individual in an atomized society, only \nthe state was left: the state was the highest authority and it became \nomnipotent as well. The society produced was perfectly malleable\n\f\n5 * )  TECHNIQUES\nand remarkably flexible from both the intellectual and the material \npoints of view. The technical phenomenon had its most favorable \nenvironment since the beginning of history.\nAt the same time, by a historical coincidence (whether fortuitous \nor not, I shall not undertake to say), what I have called a clear \ntechnical intention came into being. In all other civilizations there \nhad been a technical movement— more or less extensive work of \nthis kind— but not a mass intention, clearly understood and de­\nliberately guiding the whole society in a technical direction.\nCiedion says of the period from 1750 to 1850: \"Invention was a \npart of the normal course of life. Everyone invented. Every entre­\npreneur dreamed of more rapid and economical means of fabrica­\ntion. The work was done unconsciously and anonymously. No­\nwhere else and never before was the number of inventions per \ncapita as great as in America in the 6o‘s of that century.”\nIt is possible that a similar phenomenon took place in prehistoric \ntimes when technique appeared out of sheer necessity. Pressed on \nall sides, man reacted by creating technique. In historical times the \nsituation changed, however. Homo sapiens had by then established \nhis supremacy over the other mammals with respect to natural \nforces. Some technical efforts had been pursued, now in one field, \nnow in another; for example, in the military art of the Assyrians or \nin the art of construction of the Egyptians. There were always in­\ndividuals who possessed a clear vision of technical supremacy; say, \nArchimedes in mechanics, or Loyola in spiritual technique. But wc \nalmost never find the distinctive characteristic of our time— a precise \nview of technical possibilities, the will to attain certain ends, ap­\nplication in all areas, and adherence of the whole of society to a \nconspicuous technical objective. All these, taken together, con­\nstitute what I have termed a clear technical intention.\nWhence arose this intention? Many causes conspired to produce \nit, among them the influence of the philosophy of the eighteenth \ncentury, reinforced by the philosophy of Hegel and later that of \nMarx. But there were other factors which were as important. What \nreally produced the general movement in favor of technique was \nspecial interest.\nThis technical movement has been studied by men as different \nas Descartes and Mare. But it was only when industrial self-inter-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (5 3\nest, for the sake of efficiency, demanded a search for the “one best \nway to do work” that research was begun by Gilbreth in the field of \ntechnique, with the amazing results we see today.\nSpecial interest was and is the great motive force behind the de­\nvelopment of technical consciousness— but not necessarily any par­\nticular interest; say, the capitalistic interest or the moneyed inter­\nest. The state interest was the first to become conscious in France, \nat the time of the Revolution. The state developed political and in­\ndustrial technique, and later, with Napoleon, military and judicial \ntechnique, because it found them to be potent forces against its \nenemies within and without The state protected “the arts and the \nsciences” (in reality, techniques) not out of greatness of spirit or \nconcern for civilization, but out of the instinct for power. After the \nstate, it was the bourgeoisie who discovered how much profit could \nbe extracted from a consciously developed technique. In fact, the \nbourgeoisie has always been more or less involved with technique. \nThey were the initiators of the first financial techniques and, later \non, of the modern state. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, \nthey saw the possibilities of drawing huge profits from this system, \nespecially as they were favored by the crumbling “of morals and \nreligion” and felt themselves free, in spite of the idealistic smoke \nscreen they raised, to exploit individuals. This class put the interests \nof technique before the interests of individuals, who had to be \nsacrificed in order that technique might progress. It is solely be­\ncause the bourgeoisie made money, thanks to technique, that tech­\nnique became one of their objectives.\nThis alliance is well known and we need recall but a few facts. \nJames Watt, his steam engine perfected, was ruined and at a \ndead end. It was a bourgeois, Matthew Boulton, who grasped the \nindustrial and financial possibilities of Watt’s invention and de­\ncided to apply it. Two further facts are pertinent: commercial \ncapitalism preceded industrial capitalism; industry owed its rise to \nthe accumulation of capital originating from commerce. And where \ndid industrialization first occur and become most widespread? In \nEngland, because capitalism was more highly developed there and \nthe bourgeoisie more at liberty to act than anywhere else. This is \nwell known. The union between the bourgeoisie and technique \nwas expressed not only in the development of factories, but much\n\f\n5 4  ) TECHNIQUES\nmore subtly in the fact that the majority of technicians came from \nthis class. It was the bourgeoisie which promoted the advance of \nscience.\nMoreover, the bourgeoisie were so well aware of the relation be­\ntween economic success and the scientific foundations of that suc­\ncess that they kept in their own hands, almost as a monopoly, the \ninstruction which was the only means of access to the great schools \nand faculties that trained the technicians of science and the tech­\nnicians of society.5\nTechnical progress is a function of bourgeois money. Yet today \nthe Marxists claim that the bourgoisie either have attempted to \nrestrain technical progress or make it serve the purposes of war. \nTheir claim, however, does not prevent history from contradicting \ntheir theories. Marx himself would never have made such state- \nments, what is true today was not true in his time.\nHowever, this self-interest of the bourgeoisie was not enough to \ncarry the whole of society along with it— witness the popular re­\nactions against technical progress. As late as 1848, one of the de­\nmands of the workers was the suppression of machinery. This is \neasily understood. The standard of living had not risen, men still \nsuffered from the loss of equilibrium in their lives brought about by \na too rapid injection of technique, and they had not yet felt the in­\ntoxication of the results. The peasants and the workers bore all the \nhardships of technical advance without sharing in the triumphs. \nFor this reason, there was a reaction against technique, and so­\nciety was split. The power of the state, the money of the bour­\ngeoisie were for it; the masses were against.\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century the situation changed. \nKarl Marx rehabilitated technique in the eyes of the workers. He \npreached that technique can be liberating. Those who exploited it \nenslaved the workers, but that was the fault of the masters and not \nof technique itself.\nMarx was perhaps not the first to have said this, but he was the \nfirst to convince the masses of it. The working class would not be \nliberated by a struggle against technique but, on the contrary, by \ntechnical progress itself, which would automatically bring about \nthe collapse of the bourgeoisie and of capitalism. This reconcilia-\n* The author includes here not only faculties such as the Ecole Polytechnique, but \nalso adm inistrative tribunals such as the Conseil d'fitat (Trans.)\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 5 5\ntion of the masses to techniques was decisive. But it would not \nhave been sufficient to result in a clear consciousness of the tech­\nnical objective, the new consensus omnium, had it not appeared \nsimultaneously with a second historical fact, namely, the diffusion \nof the so-called benefits of techniques among the masses. These \nbenefits included, for example, the conveniences of daily life, the \nprogressive shortening of the work day, facilities for public trans­\nportation and medicine, new possibilities of making one’s fortune \n(in the United States and in the colonies), housing improvements, \nand so forth. A prodigious upheaval took place between 1850 and \n1914 which convinced everyone of the excellence of a technical \nmovement that could produce such marvels and alter human life. \nAll this, Marx explained, presaged even better things and pointed \nto the road to follow. Fact and theory were for once in agreement. \nHow could public opinion resist?\nDrawn by self-interest (the ideal of comfort, for instance), the \nmasses went over to the side of technique; society was converted. \nA common will developed to exploit the possibilities of technique \nto the maximum, and groups of the most conflicting interests \n(state and individual, bourgeoisie and working class) united to \nhymn its praises. Literally everyone was agreed on its excellence. \nTrue, after 1914, certain criticisms came from the intellectuals, but \nthese were ineffective because they were usually beside the point \n— manifestations of vague idealism or of sentimental humanitar- \nianism.\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, when technique had \nhardly begun to develop, another voice was raised in prophetic \nwarning against it. The voice was Kierkegaard s. But his warnings, \nsolidly thought out though they were, and in the strongest sense of \nthe word prophetic, were not heeded— for very different reasons. \nThey were too close to the truth.\nThis analysis applies chiefly to the countries where the technical \nmovement first developed— England and France. In England \nevents took a somewhat different course than in France, but they \nhad the same scope and profound significance. The historical se­\nquence varied, but the orientation in both countries was toward \ntechnical development. Social plasticity developed in England by \ndifferent paths and at a different time than in France. Sociological \ntaboos were broken at an early date. The regicide of Charles I by\n\f\nTECHNIQUES5 6 )\nCromwell gave the initial and primary impulse to social plasticity; \nas all writers agree, after this date a rigid social hierarchy no longer \nexisted in England. The supreme value was productive and efficient \nlabor which permitted the industrious to rise high on the social \nladder (William Pitt is a good example). The king no longer rep­\nresented divine authority, nor was he able to resist the nation. No \nlonger was there sociological rigidity based on the royal person or \non the power of money. It would be an error to interpret sociologi­\ncally the England of the eighteenth century in accordance with \nthe stability which is discernible in the nineteenth, and which was \nachieved after the technical revolution, when society had entered \nnew paths. In the eighteenth century, England was essentially \nmobile and unstable in all its structures. Christianity itself was not \nthe conservative force it proved to be on the Continent. Two great \ncurrents divided English society before the advent of Methodism: \nthe Church of England and the Puritans. The Puritans, even after \ntheir political failure, were the predominant influence. In keeping \nwith the trend the Reformation set, they exploded all prevailing \nreligious taboos and developed a practical and utilitarian mental­\nity that emphasized the use and even the exploitation of the good \nthings of this world given by Cod to men. The relationship of this \ntrend to the development of capitalism is well known. The Church \nof England had favored tolerance since the end of the eighteenth \ncentury and had adopted as its leading principle Bishop War- \nburton’s idea of social utility. Here, too, there was a kind of secular­\nization of religion. Religion is no longer the framework of society; \nit can no longer impose its taboos or forms upon it. Rather, it inte­\ngrates itself into society, adjusts to it, and adopts the notion of social \nutility as criterion and justification. At the same time the disintegra­\ntion and atomization of English social groups occurred— brought \nabout not so much by the influence of the state (as in France) as \nby the destruction of peasant society which began in the early \neighteenth century and of which Defoe and Swift were such elo­\nquent witnesses.\nThe peasant commune and the peasant family were slowly \nmined in the eighteenth century. The historian notes the collapse, \nrelentless and more rapid than in France, of a whole society which \nhad been in equilibrium until then. The struggle between the \nlanded and the moneyed interests ended with the victory of the\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 5 7\nmoneyed interests. It is not important here to detail the ways a new \npeasant society, based on the moneyed interest, came into being. \nNewly rich entrepreneurs bought up the great estates and took the \nplace of the old gentry, but that is not our concern. Our concern is \nthe merchants whose influence changed the organic structure of \nthe traditional world. The small landowners and the yeomen were \neliminated or reduced to an agricultural proletariat, or they were \nforced to migrate to the city. The rural corporations were ruined, \nthe communes passed almost completely into the hands of the new \nlandlords and ceased to constitute coherent sociological units. The \nmovement was accelerated by the application of new agricultural \nmethods, which were accepted much more rapidly than in France. \nThe enclosure of the commons, which in France took place chiefly \nafter 1780, began in England in 1730. The new agricultural tech­\nniques were plainly so superior that it was not possible to preserve \nthe old “open field” system— the commons, the pastures, and the \nforests; thus the final blow was dealt to the old, organic, peasant \nsociety. The peasant could not survive as such, and with him, the \nwhole of society entered into a state of flux. The plasticity we refer \nto came about in England as a result of this evolution in the use of \nland, which furnished the technical movement with the necessary \nmanpower: apathetic, vacant, and uprooted. Not only was this \nmanpower necessary for the development of industry; the masses \nthus created were indispensable to faith in techniques and the \nspread of techniques.\nTo summarize: social plasticity came about earlier in England \nthan in France, and the technical movement developed along with \nit. Moreover, the state, which was dominant in French society, did \nnot have the same influence in Creat Britain.\nThis applies too to the development of a clear technical con­\nsciousness. In Creat Britain this consciousness appeared as a bour­\ngeois interest. The spirit behind the introduction of new techniques \nin the rural districts was very different from that which character­\nized France a short time later. The technical movement in France \nwas launched by the monarchy and took a scientific form: the \nacademies and the research institutes propagated the new tech­\nniques throughout the country; and the nobles applied them, very \noften disinterestedly. In England, profit was from the very begin­\nning the prime motive. And empiricism was the dominant factor\n\f\nTECHNIQUES5« )\nbecause technique was more efficient Techniques were developed \nbecause it paid to develop them; commercial activity found them \nadvantageous. This was true in agriculture as well as in industry.\nThe English technical movement was marked by the fact that all \nthe different financial systems (banks, stock exchanges, insurance \ncompanies) were perfected. The clear consciousness of the value \nof technique expressed itself primarily in terms of money, and was \nlocated at the center of the systems of distribution. And the accel­\neration of invention in this area influenced all other techniques. \nThe British state attained this clear technical consciousness at a \ncomparatively last date, and then only when it saw that techniques \nwere to its immediate interest.\nThis phenomenon of technical clarity sometimes came about \nthrough an association of the interests of the state and the interests \nof private individuals. In steelmaking, for example, the fact that \nHenry Cort was supplier to the Admiralty was decisive, in 1780, for \nthe application and development of steel puddling. The state \nfound in this procedure an excellent means of improving its naval \nvessels. However, it was competition with the Napoleonic empire \nthat started His Majesty’s government down the road of tech­\nnique.\nThereafter, both governments understood that only technical \nefficiency in all governmental relations and enterprises could com­\nmand the paths of peace as well as the affairs of war. The English \nstate henceforth had the same influence on the development of \ntechniques as the French revolutionary state had exerted through \nthe establishment of a clear technical consciousness. The way had \nalready been paved in England by the emergence of the British \nbourgeoisie. Whatever the differences in its development in Eng­\nland and France, however, the technical consciousness that ap­\npeared was identical in both countries.\nIn the United States this took place at the beginning of the nine­\nteenth century. Until then, the society of this country was inor­\nganic. But at that time the American social milieu was favorable; \nmoreover, the Americans profited from the technical conscious­\nness evolved in Europe, and so they arrived immediately at a \nmodel for technique. Giedion has noted that the Americans began \nby mechanizing complex operations, which produced the assembly \nline, whereas the Europeans tended to mechanize simple opera-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (5  9\ntions, such as spinning. This American accomplishment was the \nresult of the exceptional flexibility of the American milieu.\nThese conditions were not found in the other European coun­\ntries: Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia. In these nations the \nsocial structures remained as they were and the social hierarchy \nwas not attacked. The taboos of religion were fanatically respected, \nand those of society were not questioned. The Inquisition and the \nTribunal of the Empire jealously guarded the spiritual and socio­\nlogical divisions of society. This world was already undermined, \nruined, and emptied of content, but its rigid forms were univer­\nsally accepted as good. There were few changes in the cities and \nnone at all in the rural areas. The traditional organism remained \nintact And when enlightened despotism began to create some ex­\ncitement, this world was so little prepared that it exhausted itself \nin the struggle against the old social structures. Consider, for ex­\nample, the fate of Peter the Great, Joseph II, and the melancholy \nand celebrated Marquis de Pombal.\nGreat inventions may have been made in Germany and Russia \nduring this period. Everyone is familiar with the claims of Hitler, \nand later of Stalin, that all important discoveries were made in \ntheir respective countries. Allowing for exaggeration, there is per­\nhaps some truth in these claims. But the discoveries were not \napplied, and only application counts in the rise of technique. \nApplication did not take place because the felicitous combination \nof factors we have discussed was lacking. The social milieu of these \ncountries, their spiritual tendencies, group psychology, sociological \nstructures, and past history were all unfavorable to the rise of tech­\nnique. The state in some countries, principally Prussia, was fav­\norable to it; but a clear technical consciousness on the part of the \nstate alone was obviously insufficient to open the door to the great \nmobilization of men and things necessary for this multiform prog­\nress.\nThe joint occurrence of the five factors we have briefly analyzed \nexplains the exceptional growth of technique. Never before had \nthese factors coincided. They are, to summarize: (1) a very long \ntechnical maturation or incubation without decisive checks before \nthe final flowering; (2) population growth; (3) a suitable eco­\nnomic milieu; (4) the almost complete plasticity of a society mal-\n\f\nTECHNIQUES6o)\nleable and open to the propagation of technique; (5) a clear tech­\nnical intention, which combines the other factors and directs them \ntoward the pursuit of the technical objective. Some of these condi­\ntions had existed in other societies; for example, the necessary tech­\nnical preparation and the destruction of taboos in the Roman Em­\npire in the third century. But the unique phenomenon was the \nsimultaneous existence of all five— all of them necessary to bring \nabout individual technical invention, the mainspring of everything \neke.\nWhat else can history teach us? Only the vanity of believing we \ncan impose our theories on history. Any philosophy which asserts \nthat human experience repeats itself is ineffectual."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER\nOO\nTHE\nCHARACTEROLOGY \nOF TECHNIQUE\nIn discussing technique today it is impossible not to take a position. \nAnd the position we take is determined by a historical choice, con­\nscious or unconscious.\nAcknowledging that the technical phenomenon is a constant of \nhuman history, is there anything new about its present aspect? \nThere are two distinct positions on this question. The first main­\ntains that there is no more real technical innovation in the modern \nworld than there was in the Stone Age. Jean Fourastie asks hu­\nmorously whether prehistoric man, the first time he saw a bronze \nsword used, did not feel as menaced by it as we feel by the atom \nbomb. It would seem, then, that technical innovations have al­\nways had the same surprising and unwelcome character for men. \n(This is an inexhaustible source of jokes for motion pictures and \ncartoons.) If we become frightened, we are merely obeying ances­\ntral instincts. There is no more real reason to be frightened by the\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE62)\natomic bomb than by any invention thousands of years old— which, \nas we see, has not destroyed the human race. The technique of to­\nday has the same characteristics as all preceding techniques. This \nnormal development, however rapid and surprising, cannot be of \ndanger to us.\nIn opposition to this resolutely optimistic position, there is an­\nother which maintains that we are confronted with a genuinely new \nphenomenon. There is nothing in common between the modern \ntechnical complex and the fragments of it which are laboriously \nsought out in the course of history to demonstrate that there has al­\nways been technique.For those who hold this viewpoint, the techni­\ncal phenomenon represents a complete change, not only of degree, \nbut of kind. Modern society is confronted with a transition (her­\nalded by Marx and particularly by Engels) which involves change \nof quality as a consequence of change of quantity. This postulate, \nwhich Engels applied to physical phenomena, holds true for so­\nciological phenomena as well Beyond a certain quantity, the phe­\nnomenon, even though in a sense it remains the same, does not \nhave the same quality, is not of the same nature.\nOne cannot choose between these two theses in a subjective \nand a priori manner. It is necessary to examine the objective char­\nacteristics of technique to determine whether there has really been \na change. But what characteristics shall we examine? Not the in­\ntrinsic ones; these do not change. If we consider intrinsic charac­\nteristics, the first position is right. The mental operation by means \nof which Archimedes constructed certain engines of war is iden­\ntical with that of any modem engineer who improves a motor. And \nthe same instinct impels a man to catapult stones and to construct \na machine gun. Likewise, the same laws of propagation of ieulmi- \ncal invention operate, no matter what the stage of technical evolu­\ntion. However, these identities are not at all convincing.\nMany men who have studied the problems posed by different \ntechniques admit that there is a radical difference between the tra­\nditional situation and the situation we face today. On the basis of \nintrinsic characteristics, these men have established a distinction be­\ntween (a) the fundamental techniques which, as Ducasse says, \n\"sum up all man’s relations with his environment,” and (b) the \ntechniques which are the results of applied science. The first group \nis composed of techniques which, although seldom identical in\n\f\nThe Technological Society (63\nmethod and form, are identical in intrinsic characteristics. They \nconstitute the complex of fundamental techniques which sociolo­\ngists such as LeRoi-Gourhan usually study and on the basis of \nwhich they elucidate the laws of technique. Primitive techniques \nhave no reality in themselves; they are merely the intermediary be­\ntween man and his environment.\nThe techniques which result from applied science date from the \neighteenth century and characterize our own civilization. The new \nfactor is that the multiplicity of these techniques has caused them \nliterally to change their character. Certainly, they derive from old \nprinciples and appear to be the fruit of normal and logical evolu­\ntion. However, they no longer represent the Same phenomenon. In \nfact, technique has taken substance, has become a reality in itself. \nIt is no longer merely a means and an intermediary. It is an object \nin itself, an independent reality with which we must reckon.\nHowever, this often admitted difference does not seem to me to \ncharacterize conclusively the singularity of the technical situation \ntoday. The characterization can be challenged because it does not \nrest upon deep historical experience. It is not enough simply to de­\nclare, by drawing on everyone’s experience of the disparity be­\ntween our technique and the limited needs of our bodies, that \ntechnique is a reality in itself. We may keep this in mind, but we \nmust also recognize that it is incomplete and not altogether con­\nvincing.\nIt is not, then, the intrinsic characteristics of techniques which \nreveal whether there have been real changes, but the characteristics \nof the relation between the technical phenomenon and society. Let \nus take a very simple comparison. A  shell explodes and the explo­\nsion is normally always the same. Any fifty shells of the same cali­\nber when exploded display approximately the same objective char­\nacteristics from a physical or chemical point of view. The sound, \nlight, and projection of fragments remain nearly identical. The in­\ntrinsic characteristics of the fifty explosions are the same. But if \nforty-nine shells go off in some remote place and the fiftieth goes off \nin the midst of a platoon of soldiers, it cannot be maintained that \nthe results are identical. A relation has been established which en­\ntails a change. To assess this change, it is not the intrinsic character \nof the explosion which must be examined, but rather its relation to \nthe environment In the same way, to learn if there has been, for\n\f\nT H E  C H A M C R M H a C T  O F  TE C H N IQ U E6 4 )\nman, a change in modem technqiue in relation to the old, we mutt \nassess, not the internal characteristics of the technique, but the ac­\ntual situation of technique in human society.\nTo go beyond this and to imagine, for example, what might flave \nbeen the psychological reaction of primitive men when faced with \ntechnical invention is pure fantasy. The question put by Jean \nFourastie, strictly speaking, has no meaning. The working of the \nmind varies according to place and time, and we cannot project our­\nselves with any assurance into the mind of primitive man. In \norder to remain within the limits of what can be known, \nwe must be content to study the relation between technique and \nsociety, a relation which has the advantage of being meaningful.\nTechnique in Civilisation\nTraditional Techniques and Society. What was the position of \ntechnique in the different societies which have preceded ours? \nMost of these societies resembled one another in their technical \naspects. But it is not enough to say that technique was restricted. \nWe must determine the precise characteristics of the limitations, \nwhich are four in number.\nFirst, technique was applied only in certain narrow, limited areas. \nWhen we attempt to classify techniques throughout history, we find \nprincipally techniques of production, of war and hunting, of con­\nsumption (clothing, houses, etc.), and, as we have said, magic. This \ncomplex of techniques would seem to modern man to represent a \nrather considerable domain and, indeed, to correspond to the \nwhole of life. What more could there be than producing, consum­\ning, fighting, and practicing magic? But we must look at these \nthings in perspective.\nIn so-called primitive societies, the whole of life was indeed en­\nclosed in a network of magical techniques. It is their multiplicity \nthat lends them the qualities of rigidity and mechanization. Magic, \nas we have seen, may even be the origin of techniques; but the pri­\nmary characteristic of these societies was not a technical but a reli­\ngious preoccupation. In spite of this totalitarianism of magic, it \nis not possible to speak of a technical universe. Moreover, the im­\nportance of techniques gradually diminishes as we reach historical\n\f\nThe Technological Society (6 5\nsocieties. la  these societies, the life o f the group was essentially \nnontechnical. And although certain productive techniques still ex­\nisted, the magical forms which had given a technique to social rela­\ntions, to political acts, and to military and judicial life tended to \ndisappear. These areas ceased to respond to techniques and became \nsubject instead to social spontaneities. The law, which had tradi­\ntionally expressed itself in certain customs, no longer had any char­\nacter of technical rigor; even the state was nothing but a force \nwhich simply manifested itself. These activities depended more on \nprivate initiative, short-lived manifestations or ephemeral tradi­\ntions, than on a persevering technical will and rational improve­\nments.\nEven in activities we consider technical, it was not always that \naspect which was uppermost. In the achievement of a small eco­\nnomic goal, for example, the technical effort became secondary to \nthe pleasure of gathering together. “Formerly, when a New Eng­\nland family convoked a ‘bee’ (that is, a meeting for working in \ncommon), it was for all concerned one of the most pleasurable \ntimes of the year. The work was scarcely more than a pretext for \ncoming together.” 1 The activity of sustaining social relations and \nhuman contacts predominated over the technical scheme of things \nand the obligation to work, which were secondary causes.\nSociety was free of technique. And even on the level of the indi­\nvidual, technique occupied a place much more circumscribed than \nwe generally believe. Because we judge in modern terms, we be­\nlieve that production and consumption coincided with the whole \no f life.\nFor primitive man, and for historical man until a comparatively \nlate date, work was a punishment, not a virtue. It was better not \nto consume than to have to work hard; the rule was to work only \nas much as absolutely necessary in order to survive. Man worked \nas little as possible and was content with a restricted consumption \nof goods (as, for example, among the Negroes and the Hindus)—  \na prevalent attitude, which limits both techniques of production \nand techniques of consumption. Sometimes slavery was the answer: \nan entire segment of the population did not work at all and de­\npended on the labor of a minority of slaves. In general, the slaves\n1 George C Hom ans, quoted by Jerome Scott and R. P. Lyatom .\n\f\n6 6 ) THE CHARACTEROLOCV OF TECHNIQUE\ndid constitute a minority. We must not be misled by Imperial \nRome, Greece under Pericles, or the Antilles in the eighteenth \ncentury. In most slaveholding nations, slaves were in a minority.\nThe time given to the use of techniques was short, compared \nwith the leisure time devoted to sleep, conversation, games, or, best \nof all, to meditation. As a corollary, technical activities had little \nplace in these societies. Technique functioned only at certain pre­\ncise and well-defined times; this was the case in all societies before \nour own. Technique was not part of man’s occupation nor a subject \nfor preoccupation.\nThis limitation of technique is attested to by the fact that in \nthe past technique was not considered nearly as important as it is \ntoday. Heretofore, mankind did not bind up its fate with technical \nprogress. Man regarded technical progress more as a relative in­\nstrument than as a god. He did not hope for very much from it. \nLet us take an example from Giedion’s admirable book, in which \nhe elucidates the small importance technique had traditionally.\nIn our day, we are unable to envisage comfort except as part of \nthe technical order of things. Comfort for us means bathrooms, easy \nchairs, foam-rubber mattresses, air conditioning, washing ma­\nchines, and so forth. The chief concern is to avoid effort and pro­\nmote rest and physical euphoria. For us, comfort is closely asso­\nciated with the material life; it manifests itself in the perfection of \npersonal goods and machines. According to Giedion, the men of \nthe Middle Ages also were concerned with comfort, but for them \ncomfort had an entirely different form and content. It represented \na feeling of moral and aesthetic order. Space was the primary ele­\nment in comfort. Man sought open spaces, large rooms, the possi­\nbility of moving about, of seeing beyond his nose, of not con­\nstantly colliding with other people. These preoccupations are alto­\ngether foreign to us.\nMoreover, comfort consisted of a certain arrangement of space. \nIn the Middle Ages, a room could be completely \"finished,\" even \nthough it might contain no furniture. Everything depended on pro­\nportions, material, form. The goal was not convenience, but rather \na certain atmosphere. Comfort was the mark of the man’s personal­\nity on the place where he lived. This, at least in part, explains the \nextreme diversity of architectural interiors in the houses of the pe­\nriod. Nor was this the result of mere whim; it represented an\n\f\nThe Technological Society (6 7\nadaptation to character; and when it had been realized, the man of \nthe Middle Ages did not care if his rooms were not well heated \nor his chairs hard.\nThis concept of comfort, closely bound up with the person, \nclearly takes death for granted, as did man himself; man’s aware­\nness of death likewise profoundly influences his search for an ade­\nquate milieu. Giedion’s study is convincing. Medieval man did not \ndream for an instant that technique had any influence at all, even \non objects which today we consider completely material and con­\nsequently of a technical order.\nThis limitation of the sphere of action of technique was in­\ncreased even more by the limitation of the technical means em­\nployed in these fields. There was no great variety of means for \nattaining a desired result, and there was almost no attempt to per­\nfect the means which did exist It seems, on the contrary, that a \nconscious Malthusian tendency prevailed. It was expressed, for \nexample, in the regulations of the guilds concerning tools, and in \nRoman law, by the principle of the economy of forms. Man tended \nto exploit to the limit such means as he possessed, and took care \nnot to replace them or create other means as long as the old ones \nwere effective. From the judicial point of view, the principle of \nthe economy of forms led to the creation of the fewest possible legal \ninstruments. Laws were few, and so were institutions. Man used \nthe utmost ingenuity to obtain a maximum of results from a mini­\nmum of means at the price of fictions, transpositions, applications \na pari and a contrario, and so on. This was also true industrially. \nSociety was not oriented toward the creation of a new instrument \nin response to a new need. The emphasis was rather on the applica­\ntion of old means, which were constantly extended, refined, and \nperfected.\nThe deficiency of the tool was to be compensated for by the \nskill of the worker. Professional know-how, the expert eye were \nwhat counted: man’s talents could make his crude tools yield the \nmaximum efficiency. This was a kind of technique, but it had none \nof the characteristics of instrumental technique. Everything varied \nfrom man to man according to his gifts, whereas technique in the \nmodem sense seeks to eliminate such variability. It is understand­\nable that technique in itself played a very feeble role. Everything \nwas done by men who employed the most rudimentary means. The\n\f\n65 )  THE CHARACTEROLOCY O F TECHNIQUE\nsearch for the ’’finished,” for perfection in use, for ingenuity of ap­\nplication, took the place of a search for new tools which would \nhave permitted men to simplify their work, but also would have \ninvolved giving up the pursuit of real skill.\nHere we have two antithetical orders of inquiry. When there is \nan abundance of instruments that answer all needs, it is impossible \nfor one man to have a perfect knowledge of each or the skill to use \neach. This knowledge would be useless in any case; the perfection \nof tlie instrument is what is required, and not the perfection of the \nhuman being. But, until the eighteenth century, all societies were \nprimarily oriented toward improvement in the use of tools and \nwere little concerned with the tools themselves. No clean-cut divi­\nsion can be made between the two orientations. Human skill, hav­\ning attained a certain degree of perfection in practice, necessarily \nentails improvement of the tool itself. The question is one of tran­\nscending the stage of total utilization of the tool by improving it  \nThere is, therefore, no doubt that the two phenomena do inter­\npenetrate. But traditionally the accent was on the human being \nwho used the tool and not on the tool he used.\nThe improvement of tools, essentially the result of the prac­\ntice of a personal art, came about in a completely pragmatic way. \nFor this reason, we can put in the first category all the techniques \nwe have classified with regard to intrinsic characteristics. A small \nnumber of techniques, not very efficient; this was the situation in \nEastern and Western society from the tenth century b.c. to the \ntenth century a.d.\nThe world of technique had still a third characteristic prior to \nthe eighteenth century; it was local. Social groups were very strong \nand closed to outsiders. There was little communication, materially \nspeaking, and even less from the spiritual point of view. Technique \nspread slowly. Certain examples of technical propagation are al­\nways cited; the introduction of the wheel into Egypt by the Hyksos; \nthe Crusades; and so on. But such events took millennia and were \naccidental. In the majority of cases, there was little transmission. \nImitation took place very slowly and mankind passed from one tech­\nnical stage to the next with great difficulty. This is true of material \ntechniques, and even more so of non-material techniques.\nCreek art remained Creek in industrial projects such as pottery­\nmaking, even when imitated by the Romans. Roman law did not\n\f\nThe Technological Society (69\nextend beyond the Roman borders, whereas the Napoleonic code \nwas adopted by Turkey and Japan. As for magic, that technique re­\nmained completely secret\nEvery technical phenomenon was isolated from similar move­\nments elsewhere. There was no transmission, only fruitless grop- \nings. Geographically, we can trace the compass of a given tech­\nnique, follow the zones of its influence, imitation, and extension; in \nalmost every case we find how small was the extent of its radiation.\nWhy was this so? The explanation is simple: technique was an \nintrinsic part of civilization And civilization consisted of numerous \nand diversified elements— natural elements such as temperament \nand flora, climate and population; and artificial elements such as \nart, technique, the political regime, etc. Among all these factors, \nwhich mingled with one another, technique was only one. It was \ninexorably linked with them and depended on them, as they de­\npended on it  It was part of a whole, part of the determinate so­\nciety, and it developed as a function of the whole and shared its \nfate.\nJust as one society is not interchangeable with another, so tech­\nnique remained enclosed in its proper framework; no more would \nit become universal than the society in which it was embedded. \nGeographically there could be no technical transmission because \ntechnique was not some anonymous piece of merchandise but \nrather bore the stamp of the whole culture. This entails much more \nthan the existence of a simple barrier between social groups. \nTechnique was unable to spread from one social group to another \nexcept when the two were in the same stage of evolution and ex­\ncept when civilizations were of the same type. In the past, in other \nwords, technique was not objective, but subjective in relation to \nits own culture.\nIt is understandable, therefore, that technique, incorporated in \nits proper framework, did not evolve autonomously. On the con­\ntrary, it depended on a whole ensemble of factors which had to \nvary with it. It is not accurate to conceive the movement in the \noversimplified manner of Marxism, as first the evolution of tech­\nnique, and subsequently the alignment of the other factors. This \nveiw is accurate for the nineteenth century but it is false for history \nas a whole. Certain important covariations traditionally existed, \nand these factors, covariant with technique, changed according\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE70)\nto the type of civilization. There was, for example, the association \nof technique and the state among the Egyptians and the Incas; of \ntechnique and philosophy in Greece and China. Francastel has \nshown how technique could be “absorbed and directed by the \narts,” as happened, say, in the fifteenth century, when it was sub­\nordinated to a plastic vision of the world, which imposed on it \nlimits and demands. At that time, there existed a whole “civiliza­\ntion well provided with technical inventions, but which deliber­\nately undertook to use them only to the degree in which these in­\nventions would allow it to realize an imaginative construction.” \nThereafter, we find a complicated “art technique” and, as else­\nwhere, we almost never find technique in a pure state.\nThe consequence was an extreme local diversity of techniques \nfor attaining the same result. No comparison or competition existed \nyet between these different systems; the formulation: \"The one best \nway in the world\" had not yet been made. It was a question of the \n\"best way” in a given locality. Because of this, arms and tools took \nvery different forms, and social organizations were extremely di­\nverse.\nIt is impossible to speak of slavery as all of a piece. Roman slav­\nery, for example, had nothing to do with Teutonic slavery, or Teu­\ntonic slavery with Chaldean. We habitually use one term to cover \nvery different realities. This extreme diversity divested technique \nof its most crucial characteristic. There was no single means \nwhich was judged best and able to eliminate all others by virtue of \nits efficiency. This diversity has made us believe that there was an \nepoch of experimentation, when man was groping to find his way. \nThis is a false notion; it springs from our modem prejudice that the \nstage we find ourselves in today represents the highest level of \nhumanity. In reality, diversity resulted not from various experimen­\ntal attempts on the part of various peoples, but from the fact that \ntechnique was always embedded in a particular culture.\nAlongside this spatial limitation of technique, we find a time \nlimitation. Until the eighteenth century, techniques evolved very \nslowly. Technical work was purely pragmatic, inquiry was empiri­\ncal, and transmission slow and feeble. Centuries were required \nfor: (a) utilization of an invention (for example, the water mill); \n(b) transition from a plaything to a useful object (gunpowder, \nautomatons); (c) transition from a magical to an economic opera-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 71\ntion (breeding of animals); (d) simple perfecting v u  instru­\nment (the horse yoke and the transition from the simple stick plow \nto the train plow). This was even more true for abstract techniques. \nAbstract techniques, I maintain, are almost nontransmissible in \ntime from a given civilization to its successor. We must be some­\nwhat skeptical, and in any case prudent, when thr evolution of \ntechniques is presented as an evolution of inventions; actually this \ndevelopment was never more than potential. There is nothing to \nprove that true technique existed heretofore, that is, in the sense of \ngeneralized application. It is possible to compile a fine catalogue of \nseventeenth-century inventions, and to deduce from it that a great \ntechnical movement was in force at that time. Many writeis have \nfallen into this error— among them, Jean Laloup and Jean Nelis. It \nis not because Pascal invented a calculating machine and Papin \na steam engine that there was a technical evolution; nor was it \nbecause a “prototype” of a power loom was built; nor because the \nprocess of the dry distillation of coal was discovered. As Cille has \nvery judiciously noted: \"The best-described machines in the eight­\neenth century Encyclopedic are possibly better conceived than \nthose of the fifteenth century, but scarcely constitute a revolution.\" \nThe initial problem was to construct the machine, to make the in­\nvented technique actually work. The second consisted in the diffu­\nsion of the machine throughout the society; and this second step \nproceeded very slowly.\nThis divergence between invention and technique, which is the \ncause of the time lag we have spoken of, is correctly interpreted \nby Gille in these words: \"There was a discontinuity of technical \nprogress but there was probably a continuity of research.” Gille \nshows clearly that technical progress develops according to a dis­\ncontinuous rhythm: “It is tied up with demographic or economic \nrhythms and with certain internal contradictions.\" This discontinu­\nity still contributes to evolutionary lag today.\nSlowness in the evolution of techniques is evident throughout \nhistory. Very few variations seem to have occurred in this constant. \nBut it cannot be maintained that this slowness was completely uni­\nform. Yet, even in periods that appear rather fertile, it is clear that \nevolution was slow. For example, Roman law, which was particu­\nlarly rich in the classical period, took two centuries to find a perfect \nform. Moreover, the number of applied inventions was sharply re-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE7*)\nstricted. The fifteenth century, in spite of its importance, produced \nno more than four or five important technical applications. The \nnatural consequence of this evolutionary slowness was that tech­\nnique could be adapted to men. Almost unconsciously, men kept \nabreast of techniques and controlled their use and influence. This \nresulted not from an adaptation of men to techniques ( as in mod­\nem times), but rather from the subordination of techniques to men. \nTechnique did not pose the problem of adaptation because it was \nfirmly enmeshed in the framework of life and culture. It developed \nso slowly that it did not outstrip the slow evolution of man himself. \nThe progress of the two was so evenly matched that man was able \nto keep pace with his techniques. From the physical point of view, \ntechniques did not intrude into his life; neither his moral evolu­\ntion nor his psychic life were influenced by them. Techniques en­\nabled man to make individual progress and facilitated certain \ndevelopments, but they did not influence him directly. Social \nequilibrium corresponded to the slowness of general evolution.\nThis evolutionary slowness was accompanied by a great irra­\ntional diversification of designs. The evolution of techniques was \nproduced by individual efforts accompanied by a multitude of scat­\ntered experiments. Men made incoherent modifications on instru­\nments and institutions which already existed; but these modifica­\ntions did not constitute adaptations. We are amazed when we \ninspect, say, a museum of arms or tools, and note the extreme di­\nversity of form of a single instrument in the same place and time. \nThe great sword used by Swiss soldiers in the sixteenth century had \nat least nine different forms (hooked, racked, double-handed, hex­\nagonal blades, blades shaped like a fleur-de-lis, grooved, etc.). This \ndiversity was evidently due to various modes of fabrication peculiar \nto the smiths; it cannot be explained as a manifestation of a techni­\ncal inquiry. The modifications of a given type were not the out­\ncome of calculation or of an exclusively technical w ill They re­\nsulted from aesthetic considerations. It is important to emphasize \nthat technical operations, like the instruments themselves, almost \nalways depended on aesthetic preoccupations. It was impossible to \nconceive of a tool that was not beautiful. As for the idea, fre­\nquently accepted since the triumph of efficiency, that the beautiful \nis that which is well adapted to use— assuredly no such notion \nguided the aesthetic searchings of the past No such conception of\n\f\n' The Technological Society (73\nbeauty (however true) moved the artisan who carved a Toledo \nblade or fabricated a harness. On the contrary, aesthetic considera­\ntions are gratuitous and permit the introduction of uselessness into \nan eminently useful and efficient apparatus.\nThis diversity of forms was manifestly conditioned by vainglory \nand pleasure— the vainglory of the user, the pleasure of the artisan. \nBoth caused changes in the classic type. And why not include as \nwell that pure fantasy which runs through all the creations of \nGreece and the Middle Ages?\nAll this led to a modification of the given type. The search for \ngreater efficiency likewise played a role, but it was one factor \namong several. The different forms were subject to trial and error, \nand certain forms were progressively stabilized and imitated, either \nbecause of their plastic perfection or because of their usefulness. \nThe final result was the establishment of a new type derived from \nits predecessor.\nIbis diversity of influences, which operated on all technical \nmechanisms, explains in part the slow tempo of progress in these \nareas. To obey a multiplicity of motives and not reason alone seems \nto be an important keynote of man. When, in the nineteenth cen­\ntury, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique \nwhich acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt \nthat not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind \nhad been violated. Men sought to reintroduce indispensable factors \nof aesthetics and morals. Out of this effort came the unprecedented \ncreation of certain aspects of style in the 1880’s: the tool with ma­\nchine-made embellishments. Sewing machines were decorated \nwith cast-iron flowers, and the first tractors bore engraved bulls’ \nheads. That it was wasteful to supply such embellishments soon \nbecame evident; their ugliness doubtless contributed to the realiza­\ntion. Moreover, these flourishes represented a wrong road, techni­\ncally speaking. The machine can become precise only to the degree \nthat its design is elaborated with mathematical rigor in accordance \nwith use. And an embellishment could increase air resistance, \nthrow a wheel out of balance, alter velocity or precision. There \nwas no room in practical activity for gratuitous aesthetic preoccu­\npations. The two had to be separated. A style then developed based \non the idea that the line best adapted to use is the most beautiful.\nAbstract techniques and their relation to morals underwent the"

    "raw_text": "7 4  ) THE characterolocy of technique\nsame evolution. Earlier, economic or political inquiries were inex­\ntricably bound with ethical inquiry, and men attempted to main­\ntain this union artificially even after they had recognized the inde­\npendence of economic technique. Modern society is, in fact, con­\nducted on the basis of purely technical considerations. But when \nmen found themselves going counter to the human factor, they re­\nintroduced— and in an absurd way— all manner of moral theories \nrelated to the rights of man, the League of Nations, liberty, jus­\ntice. None of that has any more importance than the ruffled sun­\nshade of McCormick’s first reaper. When these moral flourishes \noverly encumber technical progress, they are discarded— more or \nless speedily, with more or less ceremony, but with determination \nnonetheless. This is the state we are in today.\nThe elimination of these evolutionary factors and of technical \ndiversification has brought about a transformation of the basic \nprocess of this evolution. Technical progress today is no longer \nconditioned by anything other than its own calculus of efficiency. \nThe search is no longer personal, experimental, workmanlike; it is \nabstract, mathematical, and industrial. This does not mean that the \nindividual no longer participates. On the contrary, progress is made \nonly after innumerable individual experiments. But the individual \nparticipates only to the degree that he is subordinate to the search \nfor efficiency, to the degree that he resists all the currents today \nconsidered secondary, such as aesthetics, ethics, fantasy. Insofar \nas the individual represents this abstract tendency, he is permitted \nto participate in technical creation, which is increasingly independ­\nent of him and increasingly linked to its own mathematical law.\nIt was long believed that rational systematization would act to \nreduce the number of technical types: in the measure iliac the fac­\ntors of diversification were eliminated, the result would be fewer \nand more simple and precise types. Thus, during the latter part of \nthe nineteenth century— in the mechanical, medical, and adminis­\ntrative spheres— exact instruments were available from which fan­\ntasy and irrationality had been totally eliminated. The result was \nfewer instruments. As further progress was made, however, a new \nelement of diversification came into play: in order that an instru­\nment be perfectly efficient, it had to be perfectly adapted. But the \nmost rational instrument possible takes no account of the extreme \ndiversity of the operational environment. This represents an essen^\n\f\nThe T echnological Society ( 7  5\ntial characteristic of technique. Every procedure implies a single, \nspecific result. As Porter Gale Perrin puts it “Just as a word evokes \nan idea which exactly corresponds to no other word,” so a fixed \ntechnical procedure generates a fixed result. Technical methods are \nnot multipurposive, or adaptable, or interchangeable. Perrin has \ndemonstrated this in detail with reference to judicial technique, but \nit also holds for everything else. Take the well-known example, \ncited by Pierre de Latil, of a machine, brought to the highest possi­\nble pitch of perfection, the purpose of which was to produce from \ncast iron, at a single stroke, cylinder heads,for aircraft engines. \nThe machine was 28 meters long and cost $100,000. But the mo­\nment the required type of cylinder head was changed, the machine \nbecame good for nothing; it was unadaptable to any new operation. \nA  judicial system may function perfectly adequately in France but \nnot in Turkey. For true efficiency, not only must the rational aspect \nof the machine be taken into account, but also its adaptation to \nthe environment. A military tank will have a different form de­\npending on whether it is to be used in mountainous terrain or in \nrice paddies. The more an instrument is designed to execute a sin­\ngle operation efficiently and with utmost precision, the less can it be \nmultipurposive. A new diversification of technical apparatus thus \nappears: today instruments are differentiated as a result of the con­\ntinually more specialized usage demanded of them.\nThe field of aviation gives us one of the best examples of this. \nAircraft are described by the use to which they are put We have, \ncorrespondingly, extremely precise and more and more diversified \ntypes. The list of French military aircraft, consisting at the present \nof five great categories, is as follows: (1) strategic bombers, \n(2) tactical bombers, (3) pursuit planes, (4) reconnaissance \nplanes, and (5) transport planes. These five categories are sub­\ndivided further; there are altogether thirteen different subtypes, \nnone of which are interchangeable with one another. Each has very \ndifferent characteristics resulting from more and more refined tech­\nnical adaptations.\nThe same extensive differentiation is found in much less impor­\ntant areas. A recent brochure of the world's largest refiner of lubri­\ncating oils fists fifteen different kinds of lubricants designed exclu­\nsively for automobiles. Each type corresponds to a definite use, each \npossessing specific qualities, and all equally necessary.\n\f\n7 6) the chabacterolocy or technique\nA fourth characteristic of technique, which results from the \ncharacteristics just enumerated, is the possibility, reserved to the \nhuman being, of choice. Inasmuch as all techniques were geo­\ngraphically and historically limited, societies of many different \ntypes were able to exist. For the most part, there was an equilib­\nrium between two major types of civilization— the active and the \npassive. This distinction is well known. Some societies are oriented \ntoward the exploitation of the earth, toward war, conquest, and ex­\npansion in all its forms. Other societies are inwardly oriented; they \nlabor just enough to support themselves, concentrate on them­\nselves, are not concerned with material expansion, and erect solid \nbarriers against anything from without. From the spiritual point of \nview, these societies are characterized by a mystical attitude, by a \ndesire for self-dissolution and absorption into the divine.\nHuman societies are variable, however. A group which has \nhitherto been active might become passive. The Tibetans, for in­\nstance, were conquerors and believers in magic until their conver­\nsion to Buddhism. Thereafter they became the world s most pas­\nsive and mystical people. The reverse can also take place.\nThe two types of society coexisted throughout history; indeed, \nthis seemed necessary to the equilibrium of world and man. Until \nthe nineteenth century, technique had not yet excluded one of them. \nMoreover, man could isolate himself from the influence of tech­\nnique by attaching himself to a given group and exerting influence \non this group. Of course, other constraints acted on him; the indi­\nvidual was never completely free with respect to his group, but \nthese constraints were not completely decisive or imperative in \ncharacter.\nWhether we are considering unconscious sociological cohesion \nor the power of the state, we find these forces always necessarily \ncounterbalanced by the existence of other neighboring groups and \nother loyalties. There was no irrefutable constraint on man, because \nnothing absolutely good in respect to everything else had been dis­\ncovered. We have noted the diversity of technical form and the \nslowness of imitation. But it was always human action which was \ndecisive. When several technical forms came into contact, the indi­\nvidual made his choice on the basis of numerous reasons. Efficiency \nwas only one of them, as Pierre Deffontaines has demonstrated in \nhis work on religious geography."

The constraints to which he \nwas subject did not function decisively because they were of a non­\ntechnical nature and could be broken through. In an active civili­\nzation, even one with a fairly good technical development, the in­\ndividual could always break away and lead, say, a mystical and \ncontemplative life. The fact that techniques and man were more or \nless on the same level permitted the individual to repudiate tech­\nniques and get along without them. Choice was a real possibility \nfor him, not only with regard to his inner life, but with regard to \nthe outer form of his life as well. The essential elements of life were \nsafeguarded and provided for, more or less liberally, by the very \ncivilization whose forms he rejected. In the Roman Empire (a \ntechnical civilization in a good many respects), it was possible for \na man to withdraw and live as a hermit or in the country, apart \nfrom the evolution and the principal technical power of the Em­\npire. Roman law was powerless in the face of an individual’s deci­\nsion to evade military service or, to a very great degree, imperial \ntaxes and jurisdiction. Even greater was the possibility of the indi­\nvidual’s freedom with respect to material techniques.\nThere was reserved for the individual an area of free choice at \nthe cost of minimal effort. The choice involved a conscious decision \nand was possible only because the material burden of technique \nhad not yet become more than a man could shoulder. The existence \nof choice, a result of characteristics we have already discussed, ap­\npears to have been one of the most important historical factors gov­\nerning technical evolution and revolution. Evolution was not, then, \na logic of discovery or an inevitable progression of techniques. It \nwas an interaction of technical effectiveness and effective human \ndecision. Whenever either one of these elements disappeared, \nsocial and human stagnation necessarily followed. Such was the \ncase, for example, when effective technique was (or became) rudi­\nmentary and inefficacious among the Negroes of Africa.

    "raw_text": "THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE78 )\nwere, I believe, common to all civilizations up to the eighteenth \ncentury. Historically, their existence admits of little discussion. \nToday, however, the most cursory review enables us to conclude \nthat all these characteristics have disappeared. The relation is not \nthe same; it does not present any of the constants recognizable \nuntil now. But that is not sufficient to characterize the technical \nphenomenon of our own day. This description would situate it in a \npurely negative perspective, whereas the technical phenomemon is \na positive thing; it presents positive characteristics which are pe­\nculiar to it. The old characteristics of technique have indeed dis­\nappeared; but new ones have taken their place. Today’s technical \nphenomenon, consequently, has almost nothing in common with \nthe technical phenomenon of the past. I shall not insist on demon­\nstrating the negative aspect of the case, the disappearance of the \ntraditional characteristics. To do so would be artificial, didactic, \nand difficult to defend. I shall point out, then, in a summary fash­\nion, that in our civilization technique is in no way limited. It has \nbeen extended to all spheres and encompasses every activity, in­\ncluding human activities. It has led to a multiplication of means \nwithout limit. It has perfected indefinitely the instruments available \nto man, and put at his disposal an almost limitless variety of inter­\nmediaries and auxiliaries. Technique has been extended geo­\ngraphically so that it covers the whole earth. It is evolving with a \nrapidity disconcerting not only to the man in the street but to the \ntechnician himself. It poses problems which recur endlessly and \nevery more acutely in human social groups. Moreover, technique \nhas become objective and is transmitted like a physical thing; it \nleads thereby to a certain unity of civilization, regardless of the en­\nvironment or the country in which it operates. We are faced with \nthe exact opposite of the traits previously in force. We must, there­\nfore, examine carefully the positive characteristics of the technique \nof the present.\nThere are two essential characteristics of today’s technical phe­\nnomenon which I shall not belabor because of their obviousness. \nThese two, incidentally, are the only ones which, in general, are \nemphasized by the “best authors.”\nThe first of these obvious characteristics is rationality. In tech­\nnique, whatever its aspect or the domain in which it is applied, a \nrational process is present which tends to bring mechanics to bear\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 7 9\non all that is spontaneous or irrationaL This rationality, best exem­\nplified in systematization, division of labor, creation of standards, \nproduction norms, and the like, involves two distinct phases: first, \nthe use of “discourse” in every operation; this excludes spontaneity \nand personal creativity. Second, there is the reduction of method \nto its logical dimension alone. Every intervention of technique is, \nin effect, a reduction of facts, forces, phenomena, means, and in­\nstruments to the schema of logic.\nThe second obvious characteristic of the technical phenomenon \nis artificiality. Technique is opposed to nature. Art, artifice, artifi­\ncial: technique as art is the creation of an artificial system. This is \nnot a matter of opinion. The means man has at his disposal as a \nfunction of technique are artificial means. For this reason, the com­\nparison proposed by Emmanuel Mounier between the machine \nand the human body is valueless. The world that is being created \nby the accumulation of technical means is an artificial world and \nhence radically different from the natural world.\nIt destroys, eliminates, or subordinates the natural world, and \ndoes not allow this world to restore itself or even to enter into a \nsymbiotic relation with it. The two worlds obey different impera­\ntives, different directives, and different laws which have nothing in \ncommon. Just as hydroelectric installations take waterfalls and lead \nthem into conduits, so the technical milieu absorbs the natural. We \nare rapidly approaching the time when there will be no longer any \nnatural environment at all. When we succeed in producing artificial \naurorae boreales, night will disappear and perpetual day will reign \nover the planet.\nI have given only brief descriptions of these two well-known \ncharacteristics. But I shall analyze the others at greater length; they \nare technical automatism, self-augmentation, monism, universalism, \nand autonomy.\nCharacteristics of Modem Technique\nAutomatism of Technical Choice. ‘The one best way”: so runs the \nformula to which our technique corresponds. When everything has \nbeen measured and calculated mathematically so that the method \nwhich has been decided upon is satisfactory from the rational point\n\f\n80  ) THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE\nof view, and when, from the practical point of view, the method if \nmanifestly the most efficient of all those hitherto employed or those \nin competition with it, then the technical movement becomes self- \ndirecting. I call the process automatism.\nThere is no personal choice, in respect to magnitude, between, \nsay, 3 and 4; 4 is greater than 3; this is a fact which has no personal \nreference. No one can change it or assert the contrary or personally \nescape it. Similarly, there is no choice between two technical meth­\nods. One of them asserts itself inescapably: its results are calculated, \nmeasured, obvious, and indisputable.\nA surgical operation which was formerly not feasible but can now \nbe performed is not an object of choice. It simply is. Here we see \nthe prime aspect of technical automatism. Technique itself, ipso \nfacto and without indulgence or possible discussion, selects among \nthe means to be employed. The human being is no longer in any \nsense the agent of choice. Let no one say that man is the agent of \ntechnical progress (a question I shall discuss later) and that it is \nhe who chooses among possible techniques. In reality, he neither \nis nor does anything of the sort. He is a device for recording effects \nand results obtained by various techniques. He does not make a \nchoice of complex and, in some way, human motives. He can decide \nonly in favor of the technique that gives the maximum efficiency. \nBut this is not choice. A machine could effect the same operation. \nMan still appears to be choosing when he abandons a given method \nthat has proved excellent from some point of view. But his action \ncomes solely from the fact that he has thoroughly analyzed the re­\nsults and determined that from another point of view the method \nin question is less efficient. A good example is furnished by the \nattemnts to deooneentrate our (Treat industrial plants after we had \nconcentrated them to the maximum possible degree. Another ex­\nample would be the decision to abandon certain systems of high \nproduction in order to obtain a more constant productivity, al­\nthough it might be less per capita. It is always a question of the \nimprovement of the method in itself.\nThe worst reproach modern society can level is the charge that \nsome person or system is impeding this technical automatism. When \na labor union leader says: “In a period of recession, productivity is \na social scourge,” his declaration stirs up a storm of protest and con­\ndemnation, because he is putting a personal judgment before the\n\f\nThe TechnologictU Society ( 81\ntechnical axiom that what can he produced must be produced. If a \nmachine can yield a given result, it must be used to capacity, and it \nis considered criminal and antisocial not to do so. Technical autom­\natism may not be judged or questioned; immediate use must be \nfound for the most recent, efficient, and technical process.\nCommunism’s fundamental criticism of capitalism is that finan­\ncial capitalism checks technical progress that produces no profits; \nor that it promotes technical progress only in order to reserve for \nitself a monopoly. In any case, as Rubinstein points out, technical \nprogress occurs under capitalism for reasons which have nothing to \ndo with technique, and it is this fact which is to be criticized. Since \nthe Communist regime is oriented toward technical progress, the \nmark of the superiority of Communism is that it adopts all technical \nprogress. Rubinstein concludes his study by remarking that this \nprogress is the goal of all efforts in the Soviet Union, where it is said \nto be possible to allow free play to technical automatism without \nchecking it in any way.\nAnother traditional analysis supplements Rubinstein’s. This seri­\nous study, carried out by Thorstein Veblen, maintains that there is \na conflict between the machine and business. Financial investment, \nwhich originally accelerated invention, now prolongs technical in­\nactivity. Capitalism does not give free play to technical activity, \nthe goal of which is that a more efficient method or a more rapidly \nacting machine should ipso facto and automatically replace the pre­\nceding method or machine. Capitalism does not give free play to \nthese factors because it inadmissibly subordinates technique to ends \nother than technique itself, and because it is incapable of absorbing \ntechnical progress. The replacement of machines at the tempo of \ntechnical invention is completely impossible for capitalist enter­\nprise because there is no time to amortize one machine before new \nones appear. Moreover, the more these machines are improved, and \nhence become more efficient, the more they cost.\nThe pursuit of technical automatism would condemn capitalist \nenterprises to failure. The reaction of capitalism is well known: \nthe patents of new machines are acquired and the machines are \nnever put into operation. Sometimes machines that are already in \noperation are acquired, as in the case of England’s largest glass fac­\ntory in 1933, and destroyed. Capitalism is no longer in a position \nto pursue technical automatism on the economic or social plane. It"

It is led inevitably to crises of overproduction. And in the \nsame way it is unable to utilize the manpower freed by every new \ntechnical improvement. Crises of unemployment ensue.\nThus we return to the old schema of Marx: it is the automatism \nof technique, with its demand that everything be brought into line \nwith it, that endangers capitalism and heralds its final disappear­\nance. This is an accurate criticism, and reveals two things. First, \nthat we are correct in speaking of automatism. If the situation of \ncapitalism is indeed as described, it is so because technical progress \nacts automatically. The choice between methods is no longer made \naccording to human measure, but occurs as a mechanical process \nwhich nothing can prevent. Capitalism, in spite of all its power, \nwill be crushed by this automatism. Second, that for the men of \nour time, this automatism is just and good. If Communism can \nmake this critique of capitalism a successful springboard for propa­\nganda, it is only because the criticism is valid. And it is valid be­\ncause everything can be called into question (God first of all), ex­\ncept technical progress. There is nothing left to do but wonder at a \nmechanism that functions so well and, apparently, so tirelessly. But, \nabove all else, no finger must be laid upon it, nor its automatism in­\nterfered with. It is in this that the headway of technical progress \nbecomes automatic; when modern man renounces control over it \nand cannot bring himself to raise his hand agaiust it so as to make \nthe choice himself.\nThis, then, is the first aspect of technical automatism. Inside the \ntechnical circle, the choice among methods, mechanism, organiza­\ntions, and formulas is carried out automatically. Man is stripped of \nhis faculty of choice and he is satisfied. He accepts the situation \nwhen he sides with technique.\nLet us examine the second aspect of automatism. When we leave \nthe technical domain proper, we find a whole ensemble of nontech­\nnical means; among them a kind of preliminary process of elimina­\ntion is taking place. The various technical systems have invaded all \nspheres to the point that they are everywhere in collision with \nmodes of life which were heretofore nontechnical. Human life as a \nwhole is not inundated by technique. It has room for activities \nthat are not rationally or systematically ordered. But the collision\n\f\nThe Technological Society (8 3\nbetween spontaneous activities and technique is catastrophic for the \nspontaneous activities.\nTechnical activity automatically eliminates every nontechnical \nactivity or transforms it into technical activity. This does not mean, \nhowever, that there is any conscious effort or directive will.\nFrom the point of view which most interests modern man, that of \nyield, every technical activity is superior to every nontechnical \nactivity. Take, for example, politics. It used to be said that politics \nwas an art, consisting of finesse, aptness, a particular kind of ability, \neven genius; in short, of personal qualities which seemed to operate \nby chance. If politics was to become a technical activity, chance \nmust be eliminated. The results to be obtained must be certain. Un­\npredictability, which all men share to a greater or lesser degree, \nmust also be eliminated. Rules had to be established for this par­\nticularly unstable game if certainty of result was to be achieved. \nThe difficulty was great, but not greater, perhaps, than the difficulty \ninvolved in harnessing atomic energy.\nIt was Lenin who established political technique. He did not suc­\nceed in formulating a complete set of principles for it, but from the \nbeginning he attained a twofold result Even a mediocre politician, \nby the application of the “method,” was able to achieve a good aver­\nage policy, to ward off catastrophes, and to assure a coherent politi­\ncal line. Moreover, the method was far superior to nontechnical \npolicy; the same result could be obtained with fewer resources and \nwith much less expense.\nOn the military plane, the technique applied by Hitler (and it \nwas a technique, not military genius as with Napoleon— although it \nis a mark of genius to develop a technique for war or for politics) \nnot only enabled him to achieve what was not necessarily a direct \nresult of his technique but, more important, it enabled him to resist \nfor three years an adversary who possessed approximately a fivefold \nsuperiority in all areas— in numbers of men and military machines, \nin economic power, and so on. This capacity to resist resulted from \nthe remarkable military technique of the Gomans and from the per­\nfectly developed relationship they worked out between nation and \narmy.\nIn the same way, the political technique of Lenin’s school made, \nand is making, possible the achievement of successes over all other \npolitical forms, even when these political forms are able to bring\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROU Of TECHNIQUE««>\ninfinitely superior resources to bear. The tide of Leninian policy \nretreats for certain periods before the superior weight of the enor- \nmous politico-economic machines of the opponents. But to such a \npolitical technique only another political technique can be opposed; \nand since the American political technique, for example, is so in­\nferior, it must deploy instead an enormous expenditure of resources. \nThe superiority of a technique to enormous but inefficiently used \nresources and machinery means that the point at which technique \ninserts itself becomes a real turning point The milieu into which a \ntechnique penetrates becomes completely, and often at a stroke, a \ntechnical milieu. If a desired result is stipulated, there is no choice \npossible between technical means and nontechnical means based on \nimagination, individual qualities, or tradition. Nothing can compete \nwith the technical means. The choice is made a priori. It is not in the \npower of the individual or of the group to decide to follow some \nmethod other than the technical The individual is in a dilemma: \neither he decides to safeguard his freedom of choice, chooses to use \ntraditional, personal, moral, or empirical means, thereby entering \ninto competition with a power against which there is no efficacious \ndefense and before which he must suffer defeat; or he decides to \naccept technical necessity, in which case he will himself be the \nvictor, but only by submitting irreparably to technical slavery. In \neffect he has no freedom of choice.\nWe are today at the stage of historical evolution in which every­\nthing that is not technique is being eliminated. The challenge to a \ncountry, an individual, or a system is solely a technical challenge. \nOnly a technical force can be opposed to a technical force. All else \nis swept away. Serge Tchakotin reminds us of this constantly. In \nthe face of the psychological outrages of propaganda, what reply \ncan there be? It is useless to appeal to culture or religion. It is use­\nless to educate the populace. Only propaganda can retort to propa­\nganda, or psychological rape to psychological rape. Hitler formu­\nlated this long before Tchakotin. He writes, in Mein Kampf: \n“Unless the enemy learns to combat poison gas with poison gas, this \ntactic, which is based on an accurate evaluation of human weak­\nnesses, must lead almost mathematically to success.”\nThe exclusive character of technique gives us one of the reasons \nfor its lightning progress. There is no place for an individual today \nunless he is a technician. No social group is able to resist the pres-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (8  5\nsures of the environment unless it utilizes technique. To be in pos­\nsession of the lightning thrust of technique is a matter of life or \ndeath for individuals and groups alike; no power on earth can with­\nstand its pressures.\nWill the technical phenomena of today be able to maintain itself, \nor must it suffer in its turn impairment or even liquidation? It is \ndifficult to see ahead, and, in any case, this is not the place to try to \ndo so. Doubtless, technique has its limits. But when it has reached \nthese limits, will anything exist outside them? Its limits are presup­\nposed by its object and its method. But is it not succeeding in under­\nmining everything which is outside it? Beyond its precise and lim­\nited compass, whatever its size, will there remain anything in exist­\nence? We shall be answering this question all through this book. \nWithin the technical circle nothing else can subsist because tech­\nnique’s proper motion, as Jiinger has shown, tends irresistibly to­\nward completeness. To the degree that this completeness is not yet \nattained, technique is advancing, eliminating every lesser force. \nAnd when it has received full satisfaction and accomplished its \nvocation, it will remain alone in the field. Technique thus reveals \nitself at once destroyer and creator, and no one wishes or is able to \nmaster it.\nSelf-augmentation. The self-augmentation of technique also has \ntwo aspects. At the present time, technique has arrived at such a \npoint in its evolution that it is being transformed and is progressing \nalmost without decisive intervention by man. Modern men are so \nenthusiastic about technique, so assured of its superiority, so im­\nmersed in the technical milieu, that without exception they are \noriented toward technical progress. They all work at it, and in every \nprofession or trade everyone seeks to introduce technical improve­\nment. Essentially, technique progresses as a result of this common \neffort Technical progress and common human effort come to the \nsame thing. Vincent analyzes with great subtlety the multitude of \nfactors which intervene, each in its small way, in technical pro­\ngress: the consumer, accumulation of capital, research bureaus and \nlaboratories, and the organization of production, which acts “in \nsome sense mechanically.’’ Technical progress appears to Vincent \nto be “the resultant' of all these factors. In one sense, technique \nindeed progresses by means of minute improvements which are the \nresult of common human efforts and are indefinitely additive until"

But it is equally true that technique sharply reduces the role \nof human invention. It is no longer the man of genius who discovers \nsomething. It is no longer the vision of a Newton which is decisive. \nWhat is decisive is this anonymous accretion of conditions for the \nleap ahead. When all the conditions concur, only minimal human \nintervention is needed to produce important advances. It might \nalmost be maintained that, at this stage of evolution of a technical \nproblem, whoever attacked the problem would find the solution.\nThe example of the steam engine and its manifold successive \nsmall alterations is well known. This example is being repeated \ntoday in all fields.\nThe accretion of manifold minute details, all tending to perfect \nthe ensemble, is much more decisive than the intervention of the \nindividual who assembles the new data, adds some element which \ntransforms the situation, and thus gives birth to a machine or to \nsome spectacular system that will bear his name.\nThis is the way progress takes place in the field of education, too. \nAfter the general direction given by initiators (like Decroly or \nMontessori), it is the findings of thousands of educators which \nceaselessly nourish the improvement of technique. In fact, educa­\ntional systems are completely transformed as a result of practice—  \nwithout any one’s being quite aware of it. In industrial plants, the \ndiscovery of details is utilized in another way: to create interest on \nthe part of the worker in his work. The worker is asked not only to \nuse the machine he operates, but also to study it to find flaws in its \noperation, then to find remedies against these faults, and in addition \nto determine how its productivity might be improved. The result is \nthe “suggestion box” by means of which workers may indicate their \nideas and plans for improvement.\nThis collective, anonymous research advances techniques almost \neverywhere in the world by a like impulse, a striking result of self­\naugmentation. It is noticeable that identical technical inventions are \nproduced simultaneously in many countries. To the degree that \nscience is taking on a more and more technical aspect, these dis­\ncoveries are made everywhere at the same time— a further indica­\ntion that scientific discoveries are, in reality, governed by technique.\nThe smashing of the atom and the atomic bomb are characteris-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (8 7\ntic of this simultaneity. In Germany, Norway, the U.S.S.R., the \nUnited States, and France, research had reached almost the same \npoint in 1939. But circumstances upset European technical evolu­\ntion and gave superiority to the United States. Among these circum­\nstances were the invasion of Norway and France, the collapse of \nGermany several months after the discovery, and the lack of means \nand raw material in the U.S.S.R. What is true of scientific inventions \nis much more true of technical inventions. Only lack of means halts \nprogress in certain countries. The more advanced a country is in the \nemployment of technique, the more material is required, whether \nin numbers of men, raw materials, or complexity of machines. A \ncountry must be wealthy to exploit techniques to a maximum. And \nwhen the country is able to do this, technique returns a hundredfold \nincrease in its wealth. This is another element in self-augmenta­\ntion.\nIt is still necessary to justify the term self-augmentation, since it \nappears to be contradicted by what I have just been saying. If \ntechnical advance is assured by the joint effort of thousands of \ntechnicians, each of whom makes his contribution, it would seem \nimpossible to speak of self-augmentation. But there is another as­\npect which must be brought to light.\nThere is an automatic growth (that is, a growth which is not \ncalculated, desired, or chosen) of everything which concerns \ntechnique. This applies even to men Statistically, the number of \nscientists and technicians has doubled every decade for a century \nand a half. Apparently this is a self-generating process: technique \nengenders itself. When a new technical form appears, it makes \npossible and conditions a number of others. To take a plain and \nelementary example: the internal-combustion engine made possible \nand conditioned the techniques of the automobile, the submarine, \nand so on. In the same way, once a technical procedure has been \ndiscovered, it is applicable in many fields other than the one for \nwhich it was primarly invented. The techniques of “operational \nresearch,” for example, were devised to help make certain military \ndecisions. But it was immediately noted that they could be ap­\nplied wherever any decision had to be made. As Barache, a special­\nist in these techniques, says: “The nature of the problems them- \n•elves was secondary . . the methods of approach and the tech-\n\f\nthe characteholocy of technique88 )\nniques employed proved to have a general scope.” The same could \nbe said for the techniques of organization. There is, therefore, a self­\naugmentation of the areas of application.\nThis does not necessarily mean an infinite or indefinite augmen­\ntation of technique. I do not wish at this point to enter the realm of \nprognosis, but predictions of the more or less rapid extinction of \ntechnical progress seem to me to be contradicted by the facts. \nWhether it be Lewis Mumford, say, declaring that the era of \nmechanical progress is almost at an end, or Colin Clark announc­\ning the transition of secondary mechanical activities to tertiary ac­\ntivities, they are exhibiting what can only be termed a dangerous \nconfidence.\nLewis Mumford shows that certain of our inventions cannot be \nimproved, that the possible domain of mechanical activity cannot \nbe extended, and that mechanical progress is limited by the nature \nof the physical world. This last is true. But we are far from knowing \nthe total possibilities of the physical world. And after Mumford had \nwritten that statement fifteen years ago, servomechanisms, radar, \nand atom smashing were discovered. It is obvious that the augmen­\ntation of machines cannot be unlimited. But, so as not to rest our \nhopes on an alleged stagnation, it will be enough for this progress \nto continue for another century.\nWhat is true of mechnical techniques is also true of economic \ntechniques. I agree fully with the remarks of Leon Hugo Dupriez \nwhen he points out the error of the “stagnationist?”— of Wolf, for \nexample, who writes: \"The law of the limit of technico-economic \ndevelopment is that past progress closes the door to future progress. \nFor future progress there remains in every case only a margin, only a \nfraction, indeed only a small fraction, of past progress.” Dupricz's \nexposure of the error of statements like this seems to me so con­\nvincing that I shall content myself with referring the reader to his \nwork.\nOn the other hand, Lewis Mumford shows (and, from another \nperspective, this is also Colin Clark’s thought) that the best organi­\nzation will tend to reduce the use of certain machines. This is \nrigorously exact. But this “best organization” is precisely technique \nitself and, moreover, it comprises a mechanical element as well. \nWhen Fourastie announces an augmentation of the tertiary, non- \nmechanized sector, the extraordinary progress of administrative\n\f\nThe Technological Society (8 9\nmechanization of the last ten years must be considered. This mecha­\nnization completely modifies the conditions of human work by \nwhat has been termed \"the replacement of the organic and the \npsychological by the mechanical.” It is certain that this fact will \nentail the same social crisis of unemployment as in the “secondary” \nsector. To take an example, the tabulator adds and prints 45,000 \nnumbers an hour (as compared with 1,500 for a trained employee). \nIt reads, calculates, analyzes, and prints 150 lines a minute. A \npunching machine, attached to it, produces the punched cards \nwhich recapitulate the results. The Gamma (a magnetic-drum \nmachine) has a “memory” with a capacity for 200,000 individual \nitems of data. A 1960-model calculating machine can handle 40,000 \noperations a second. The machine, along with organizational devel­\nopment, is now the means of reducing both the number of em­\nployees and expenses, and also of reducing, on the collective plane, \nthe tertiary sector of manpower.\nWe can hardly agree that mechanical augmentation is decelerat­\ning. We are simply in another phase of technical progress: the \nphase of assimilation, organization, and conquest of the other areas. \nHere the progress to be made seems limitless, and consists primarily \nin the efficient systematization of society and the conquest of the \nhuman being. All that can be said is that, at best, technical activity \nhas changed its field of operation; it cannot be said that it has slowed \ndown.\nMoreover, nothing argues that subsequently technical activity \nwill not again turn toward the world of machines with renewed \nvigor. On the whole, it is the principle of the combination of tech­\nniques which causes self-augmentation.\nSelf-augmentation can be formulated in two laws:\n1. In a given civilization, technical progress is irreversible.\n2. Technical progress tends to act, not according to an arith­\nmetic, but according to a geometric progression.\nThe first of these laws— and we base our conviction on the whole \nof history— makes us certain that every invention calls forth other \ntechnical inventions in other domains. There is never any question \nof an arrest of the process, and even less of a backward movement \nArrest and retreat only occur when an entire society collapses. In \nthe transition to a successor, a certain number of technical proce \ndures are lost. But, in the framework of the same civilization.\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEBOUXJY OF TECHNIQUE90 )\ntechnical progress is never in question. Later I shall examine the \nreasons for this. Technical progression is of the same nature as the \nprocess of numbering; there is no good ground for halting the pro­\ngression, because after each number we can always add 1. In tech­\nnical evolution also, it seems that limits no longer exist Improve­\nments that result from the application of technique to the matter \nat hand (whether it be physical or social) can be added uninter­\nruptedly; there is no reason for arresting the process. In arguing \nthus, the qualification must be made that this can be said only of the \nensemble of techniques, of the technical phenomenon, and not \nof any particular technique. For every technique taken by itself \nthere apparently exist barriers that act to impede further progress, \nbarriers to the addition of new inventions— but these can sometimes \nbe cleared, as the sound barrier has been for aircraft. For the tech­\nnical phenomenon in its ensemble, however, a limitless progress is \nopen. This progress, as Wiener has shown, is a necessity. Since \ntechniques, proportionally to their development, exhaust the re­\nsources of nature, it is indispensable to fill the vacuum so created \nby a more rapid technical progress. Only inventions perpetually \nmore numerous and automatically increasing can make good the \nunheard-of expenditures and the irremediable consumption of raw \nmaterials such as wood, coal, petroleum, and even water.\nWhat is it that determines this progression today? We can no \nlonger argue that it is an economic or a social condition, or educa­\ntion, or any other human factor. Essentially, the preceding tech­\nnical situation alone is determinative. When a given technical \ndiscovery occurs, it has followed almost of necessity certain other \ndiscoveries. Human intervention in this succession appears only as \nan incidental cause, and no one man can do this by himself. But \nanyone who is sufficiently up-to-date technically can make a valid \ndiscovery which rationally follows its predecessors and rationally \nheralds what is to follow.\nTwo points must be made more precise here. First, the tech­\nnical consequences of a technical improvement are not necessarily \nof a kind. Thus, a purely mechanical discovery may have repercus­\nsions in the domain of social techniques or in that of organizational \ntechniques. For example, machines that use perforated cards affect \nstatistics and the organization of certain business enterprises. Con-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (g i\nversely, some kind of social technique (for instance, full employ­\nment) may entail an improvement in the techniques of economic \nproduction.\nHere we note the interdependence of techniques which is stated \nin the second law of self-augmentation: technical progress tends to \nbe brought about according to a geometric progressioa A technical \ndiscovery has repercussions and entails progress in several branches \nof technique and not merely in one. Moreover, techniques combine \nwith one another, and the more given techniques there are to be \ncombined, the more combinations are possible. Thus, almost with­\nout deliberate will, by a simple combination of new data, incessant \ndiscoveries take place everywhere; and whole fields are opened up \nto technique because of the meeting of several currents. Material \ntechniques of communication, psychological techniques, commer­\ncial techniques, techniques of authoritarian government, all com­\nbine to produce the important phenomenon of propaganda, which \nrepresents a new technique independent of all the rest and neces­\nsarily produced as a consequence of the preceding phenomena.\nThis second law of self-augmentation explains a characteristic of \nthe technical movement which has engaged the attention of con­\ntemporary sociologists. This is the unevenness of technical develop­\nment. Enormous disparities exist not only in the various global areas \nof technical expansion but also in each field within the various sec­\ntors. Technique progresses more rapidly in one branch than in \nanother— and certain retrogressions are always possible. To Frankel \nthis unevenness of development is the key to the disturbances of \nequilibrium and the social difficulties that the technical phenom­\nenon provokes. According to Frankel, if all branches evolved in the \nsame rhythm, there would be no problem. Frankel’s view, certainly \ntoo simple, is probably not inexact. However, it explains little. In \nfact, these clashing rhythms cannot be altered because of tech­\nnical automatism.\nFourastie is right in arguing that technical progress is unpredict­\nable. It cannot be known with certainty even a short time in advance \nin what quarter the new technical invention will be produced, \nprecisely because such inventions are, for the most part, the result \nof self-augmentation. (Of course, a distinction must be made be­\ntween invention and discovery.) Short of halting progress by force"

The present \nlevel of technique brings on new advances, and these in turn add to \nexisting technical difficulties and technical problems, which de­\nmand further advances still. This is a concrete problem in town \nplanning. A large city supposes a concentration of the means of \ntransport, air control, traffic organization, and so on. Each of these \npermits the city to grow even larger and promotes new technical \nadvances. For example, to make housework easier, garbage-disposal \nunits have been put into use which allow the garbage to run off \nthrough the kitchen sinks. The result is enormous pollution of the \nrivers. It is then necessary to find some new means of purifying the \nrivers so that water can be used for drinking. A great quantity of \noxygen is required for bacteria to destroy these organic materials. \nAnd how shall we oxygenate rivers? This is an example of the way \nin which technique engenders itself.\nThe mechanization of administrative work in business offices \nraises the problem of a necessarily different kind of organization. \nIt is not merely a question of replacing human beings with machines \nor of speeding up the work (of bookkeeping, for example), but \nrather of effecting operations of a new type which must be inte­\ngrated into a new kind of organization. For example, the organiza­\ntion of the whole system of inventory analysis (with its four func­\ntions of entering, grouping, totaling, and comparing) becomes \nnecessary. An ensemble of new techniques must be elaborated with­\nout which the machine in question would be good for nothing, \nresulting only in what Mas terms “pseudo-systematization.\"\nThe implications of self-augmentation become clearer: the in­\ndividual's role is less and less important in technical evolution. \nThe more factors there are, the more readily they combine and the \nmore evident is the urgent need for each technical advance. \nAdvance for its own sake becomes proportionately greater and \nthe expression of human autonomy proportionately feebler.\nHuman beings are, indeed, always necessary.

Henceforth, men will be \nable to act only in virtue of their commonest and lowest nature, \nand not in virtue of what they possess of superiority and individ­\nuality. The qualities which technique requires for its advance are \nprecisely those characteristics of a technical order which do not \nrepresent individual intelligence. And here we enter into another \narea, the nature of the technician.\nIn this decisive evolution, the human being does not play a part. \nTechnical elements combine among themselves, and they do so \nmore and more spontaneously. In the future, man will apparently \nbe confined to the role of a recording device; he will note the effects \nof techniques upon one another, and register the results.\nA whole new kind of spontaneous action is taking place here, and \nwe know neither its laws nor its ends. In this sense it is possible to \nspeak of the “reality” of technique— with its own substance, its own \nparticular mode of being, and a life independent of our power of \ndecision. The evolution of techniques then becomes exclusively \ncausal; it loses all finality. This is what economists such as Alfred \nSauvy mean when they say that \"by a slow reversal . . . produc­\ntion is more and more determined by the wishes of individuals in \ntheir capacity as producers, than by their decisions as consumers.” \nIn reality, it is not the “wishes” of the “producers’  which control, \nbut the technical necessity of production which forces itself on the \nconsumers. Anything and everything which technique is able to \nproduce is produced and accepted by the consumer. The belief \nthat the human producer is still master of production is a dangerous \nillusion.\nTechnique is organized as a closed world. It utilizes what Hie \nmass of men do not understand. It is even based on human igno­\nrance. As Charles Camichel says: “ The worker cannot understand \nthe workings of modem industry.” The individual, in order to make \nuse of technical instruments, no longer needs to know about his \ncivilization. And no single technician dominates the whole com­\nplex any longer. The bond that unites the fragmentary actions and \ndisjointedness of individuals, co-ordinating and systematizing their \nwork, is no longer a human one, but the internal laws of technique. \nThe human hand no longer spans the complex of means, nor does \nthe human brain synthesize man’s acts. Only the intrinsic monism\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE94)\nof technique assures cohesion between human means and acts. \nTechnique reigns alone, a blind force and more clear-sighted than \nthe best human intelligence.\nThis phenomenon of self-augmentation gives technique a \nstrangely harsh aspect. It resembles nothing other than itself. What­\never the domain to which it is applied, man or Cod, technique \nsimply is; it undergoes no modifications in the movement which \nis its being and essence. It is the only locus where form and \nbeing are identical. It is only a form, but everything conforms to it. \nHere technique assumes the peculiar characteristics which make it \na thing apart. A precise and well-defined boundary surrounds it: \nthere is that which is technique, and there is everything else, which \nis not. Whoever passes this boundary and enters into technique is \nconstrained to adopt its characteristics. Technique modifies what­\never it touches, but it is itself untouchable. Nothing in nature, or in \nsocial or human life, is comparable with it. The intelligence of art or \nwar comes nowhere near that of technique, no more than does the \nindustry of ants or bees. A hybrid but not sterile being, and capable \nof self-generation, technique traces its own limits and fashions its \nown image.\nWhatever the adaptations nature or circumstances demand of it, \ntechnique remains self-identical in its characteristics and its course. \nHindrances seem to compel it to become, not something else, but \neven more itself. Everything it assimilates strengthens it in its \ntraits. There is no hope of seeing it change into a fine and gracious \nbeing: it is neither Caliban nor Ariel, but it has been able to take \nAriel and Caliban into the unconditioned circles of its universal \nmethod.\nM on ismThe technical phenomenon, embracing all the \nseparate techniques, forms a whole. This monism of technique was \nalready obvious to us when we determined, on the basis of the \nevidence, that the technical phenomenon presents, every­\nwhere and essentially, the same characteristics. It is useless to look \nfor differentiations. They do exist, but only secondarily. The \ncommon features of the technical phenomenon are so sharply\n* The French word is tmictti or InxScabiliti. I have adopted “m onism ” as the Eng­\nlish equivalent. \"Holism” might have been better. In any case, the accumulated \nphilosophical baggage of both these term s m ust be rejected and the meaning of the \nterm  understood contextually. (Trans.)\n\f\nThe Technologjlcd Society (95\ndrawn that it is easy to discern that which is the technical phenom­\nenon and that which is not The difficulties experienced in the study \nof technique arise partly from the method to be used and partly \nfrom terminology. They do not arise from the phenomenon itself, \nwhich is eminently simple to fix.\nTo analyze these common features is tricky, but it is simple to \ngrasp them. Just as there are principles common to things as dif­\nferent as a wireless set and an internal-combustion engine, so the \norganization of an office and the construction of an aircraft have \ncertain identical features. This identity is the primary mark of that \nthoroughgoing unity which makes the technical phenomenon a \nsingle essence despite the extreme diversity of its appearances.\nAs a corollary, it is impossible to analyze this or that element out \nof it— a truth which is today particularly misunderstood. The great \ntendency of all persons who study techniques is to make distinc­\ntions. They distinguish between the different elements of technique, \nmaintaining some and discarding others. They distinguish between \ntechnique and the use to which it is put. These distinctions are \ncompletely invalid and show only that he who makes them has \nunderstood nothing of the technical phenomenon. Its parts are \nontologically tied together; in it, use is inseparable from being.\nIt is common practice, for example, to deny the unity of the \ntechnical complex so as to be able to fasten one’s hopes on one or \nanother of its branches. Mumford gives a remarkable example of \nthis when he contrasts the grandeur of the printing press with the \nhorridness of the newspaper. “On the one side there is the gigantic \nprinting press, a miracle of fine articulation . . . On the other the \ncontent of the papers themselves recording the most vulgar and \nelementary emotional states . . . There the impersonal, the co­\noperative, the objective; here the limited, the subjective, the recalci­\ntrant, the ego, violent and full of hate and fear, etc. . . .” Unfortu­\nnately, it did not occur to Mumford to ask whether the content of \nour newspapers is not really necessitated by the social form imposed \non man by the machine.\nThis content is not the product of chance or of some economic \nform. It is the result of precise psychological and psychoanalytical \ntechniques. These techniques have as their goal the bringing to the \nindividual of that which is indispensable for his satisfaction in the \nconditions in which the machine has placed him, of inhibiting in\n\f\nTHE CHARACIEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE96 )\nhim the sense of revolution, of subjugating him by flattering him. \nIn other words, journalistic content is a technical complex expressly \nintended to adapt the man to the machine.\nIt is certain that a press of high intellectual tone and great moral \nelevation either would not be read ( and then one would scarcely \nsee the wherefore of these beautiful machines) or would provoke \nin the long run a violent reaction against every form of technical \nsociety, including the machine. This reaction would come about not \nbecause of the ideas such a press would disseminate, but because \nthe reader would no longer find in it the indispensable instrument \nfor releasing his repressed passions.\nIn a sound evaluation of the problem, it ought never to be said: \non the one side, technique; on the other, the abuse of it There are \ndifferent techniques which correspond to different necessities. But \nall techniques are inseparably united. Everything hangs together \nin the technical world, as it does in the mechanical; in both, the \nadvisability of the isolated means must be distinguished from the \nadvisability of the mechanical ‘‘complex.’*  The claims of the me­\nchanical “complex' must prevail when, for example, a machine too \ncostly or overrefined threatens to wreck the ensemble.\nThere is an attractive notion which would apparently resolve \nall technical problems: that it is not the technique that is wrong, but \nthe use men make of it. Consequently, if the use is changed, there \nwill no longer be any objection to the technique.\nI shall return more than once to this conception. Let us examine a \nsingle aspect of it now. First, it manifestly rests on the confusion \nbetween machine and technique. A man can use his automobile to \ntake a trip or to kill his neighbors. But the second use is not a use; it \nis a crime. The automobile was not created to kill people, so the fact \nis nut important. 1 know, of course, that killing people is not what \nthose wiho explain things in this way have in mind. They prefer to \nsay that man orients his pursuits in the direction of good and not of \nevil. They mean that technique seeks to invent rational therapies \nand not poison gases, useful sources of energy and not atomic \nbombs, commercial and not military aircraft, etc. This leads them \nstraight back to man— man who decides in what direction to orient \nhis researches. (Must it not be, then, that man is becoming better?) \nBut all this is an error. It resolutely refuses to recognize technical \nreality. It supposes, to begin with, that men orient technique in a\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 9 7\ngiven direction for moral, and consequently nontechnical, reasons. \nBut a principal characteristic of technique (which we shall \nstudy at length) is its refusal to tolerate moral judgments. It is \nabsolutely independent of them and eliminates them from its \ndomain. Technique never observes the distinction between moral \nand immoral use. It tends, on the contrary, to create a completely \nindependent technical morality.\nHere, then, is one of the elements of weakness of this point of \nview. It does not perceive technique’s rigorous autonomy with \nrespect to morals; it does not see that the infusion of some more or \nless vague sentiment of human welfare cannot alter it. Not even the \nmoral conversion of the technicians could make a difference. At \nbest, they would cease to be good technicians.\nThis attitude supposes further that technique evolves with some \nend in view, and that this end is human good. Technique, as I \nbelieve I have shown, is totally irrelevant to this notion and pursues \nno end, professed or unprofessed. It evolves in a purely causal \nway: the combination of preceding elements furnishes the new \ntechnical elements. There is no purpose or plan that is being pro­\ngressively realized. There is not even a tendency toward human \nends. We are dealing with a phenomenon blind to the future, in a \ndomain of integral causality. Hence, to pose arbitrarily some goal or \nother, to propose a direction for technique, is to deny technique and \ndivest it of its character and its strength.\nThere is a final argument against this position. It was said that \ndie use made of technique is bad. But this assertion has no meaning \nat all. As I have pointed out, a number of uses can always be made \nof the machine, but only one of them is the technical use. The use of \nthe automobile as a murder weapon does not represent the tech­\nnical use, that is, the one best way of doing something. Technique is \na means with a set of rules for die game. It is a ‘ method of being \nused” which is unique and not open to arbitrary choice; we gain no \nadvantage from the machine or from organization if it is not used as \nit ought to be. There is but one method for its use, one possibility. \nLacking this, it is not a technique. Technique is in itself a method \nof action, which is exacdy what a use means. To say of such a \ntechnical means that a bad use has been made of it is to say that no \ntechnical use has been made of it, that it has not been made to \nyield what it could have yielded and ought to have yielded. The\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OP TECHNIQUE9 &  )\ndriver who uses his automobile carelessly makes a bad use of it. \nSuch use, incidentally, has nothing to do with the use which \nmoralists wish to ascribe to technique. Technique is a use. Moralists \nwish to apply another use, with other criteria. What they wish, to be \nprecise, is that technique no longer be technique. Under the cir­\ncumstances, there are no further significant problems.\nThere is no difference at all between technique and its use. \nThe individual is faced with an exclusive choice, either to use the \ntechnique as it should be used according to the technical rules, or \nnot to use it at all It is impossible to use it otherwise than according \nto the technical rules.\nUnfortunately, men today accept this reality only with difficulty. \nThus, when Mumford makes the statement: \"The army is the \nideal form towards which a purely mechanical industrial system \nmust tend,” he is unable to restrain himself from adding: “But the \nresult is not ideal.” What is the “ideal\" doing here? The ideal is not \nthe problem. The problem is solely to know whether this mode of \norganization responds to technical criteria. Mumford is able to \nshow that it is nothing of the kind, because he limits techniques to \nmachines. But if he were to accept the role of human techniques in \nthe organization of the army he could account for the fact that the \narmy indeed remains the irreproachable model of a technical \norganization, and its value has nothing to do with an ideal. It is \ninfantile to wish to submit the machine to the criterion of the ideal.\nIt is also held that technique could be directed toward that which \nis pusilive, constructive, and enriching, omitting that which is \nnegative, destructive, and impoverishing. In demagogic formula­\ntion, techniques of peace must be developed and techniques of \nwar rejected. In a less simple-minded version, it is held that means \nought to be sought which palliate, without increasing, the draw­\nbacks of technique. Could not atomic engines and atomic power \nhave been discovered without creating the bomb? To reason thus is \nto separate technical elements with no justification. Techniques of \npeace and alongside them other and different techniques of war \nsimply do not exist, despite what good folk think to the contrary.\nThe organization of an army comes to resemble more and more \nthat of a great industrial plant. It is the technical phenomenon \npresenting a formidable unity in all its parts, which are inseparable. \nThe fact that the atomic bomb was created before the atomic\n\f\nThe Technological Society (99\nengine was not essentially the result of the perversity of technical men. Nor was it solely the attitude of the state which determined this order. The action of the state was certainly the deciding factor in atomic research (I shall take up this point later). Research was greatly accelerated by the necessities of war and consequently directed toward a bomb. If the state had not been oriented toward the ends of war, it would not have devoted so much money to atomic research. All this caused an undeniable factor of orientation to intervene. But if the state had not promoted such efforts, it would have been the whole complex of atomic research which would have been halted without distinction between the uses of war and peace.If atomic research is encouraged, it is obligatory to pass through the stage of the atomic bomb; the bomb represents by far the sim­plest utilization of atomic energy. The problems involved in the military use of atomic energy are infinitely more simple to resolve than are those involved in its industrial use. For industrial use, all the problems involved in the bomb must be solved, and in addition certain others, a fact corroborated by J. Robert Oppenheimer in his Paris lecture of 1958. The experience of Great Britain between \n1955 and i960 in producing electricity of nuclear origin is very significant in this respect.It was, then, necessary to pass through the period of research which culminated in the bomb before proceeding to its normal sequel, atomic motive power. The atomic-bomb period is a transi­tory, but unfortunately necessary, stage in the general evolution of this technique. In the interim period represented by the bomb, the possessor, finding himself with so powerful an instrument, is led to use it. Why? Because everything which is technique is necessarily used as soon as it is available, without distinction of good or evil. This is the principal law of our age. We may quote here Jacques Soustelle’s well-known remark of May, i960, in reference to the atomic bomb. It expresses the deep feeling of us all: “Since \nit was possible, it was necessary/* Really a master phrase for all technical evolution.Even an author as well disposed toward the machine as Mumford recognizes that there is a tendency to utilize all inventions whether there is need for them or not. “Our grandparents used sheet iron for walls although they knew that iron is a good conductor of"

    "raw_text": "THE CHARACTEROLOCY Or TECHNIQUE100  )\nheat . . . The introduction of anesthetics led to the performance \nof superfluous operations. ...\"  To say that it could be otherwise \nis simply to make an abstraction of man.\nAnother example is the police. The police have perfected to an \nunheard of degree technical methods both of research and of action. \nEveryone is delighted with this development because it would seem \nto guarantee an increasingly efficient protection against criminals. \nLet us put aside for the moment the problem of police corruption \nand concentrate on the technical apparatus, which, as I have \nnoted, is becoming extremely precise. Will this apparatus be ap­\nplied only to criminals? We know that this is not the case; and we \nare tempted to react by saying that it is the state which applies this \ntechnical apparatus without discrimination. But there is an error \nof perspective here. The instrument tends to be applied everywhere \nit can be applied. It functions without discrimination— because it \nexists without discrimination. The techniques of the police, which \nare developing at an extremely rapid tempo, have as their neces­\nsary end the transformation of the entire nation into a concentra­\ntion camp. This is no perverse decision on the part of some party or \ngovernment. To be sure of apprehending criminals, it is necessary \nthat everyone be supervised. It is necessary to know exactly what \nevery citizen is up to, to know his relations, his amusements, etc. \nAnd the state is increasingly in a position to know these things.\nThis does not imply a reign of terror or of arbitrary arrests. The \nbest technique is one which makes itself felt the least and which \nrepresents the least burden. But every citizen must be thoroughly \nknown to the police and must live under conditions of discreet \nsurveillance. All this results from the perfection of technical meth­\nods.\nThe police cannot attain technical perfection unless they have \ntotal control. And, as Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt has remarked, this \ntotal control has both an objective and a subjective side. Sub­\njectively, control satisfies the desire for power and certain sadistic \ntendencies. But the subjective aspect is not the dominant one. It is \nnot the major aspect, the expression of what is to come. In reality, \nthe objective aspect of control— more and more, that is to say, the \npure technique which creates a milieu, an atmosphere, an environ­\nment, and even a model of behavior in social relations— dominates \nmore and more. The police must move in the direction of anticipat-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (101\ning and forestalling crime. Eventually intervention will be useless. \nThis state of affairs can come about in two ways: first, by constant \nsurveillance, to the end that noxious intentions be known in advance \nand the police be able to act before the premeditated crime takes \nplace; second, by the climate of social conformity which we have \nmentioned. This goal presupposes the paternal surveillance of every \ncitizen and, in addition, the closest possible tie-in with all other \ntechniques— administrative, organizational, and psychological. The \ntechnique of police control has value only if the police are in close \ncontact with the trade unions and the schools. In particular, it is \nallied with propaganda. Wherever the phenomenon is observed, \nthis connection exists. Propaganda itself cannot be efficient unless \nit brings into play the whole state organization, and particularly the \npolice power. Conversely, police power is a genuine technique only \nwhen it is supplemented by propaganda, which plays a leading role \nin the psychological environment necessary to the completeness of \nthe police power. But propaganda must also teach acceptance of \nwhat the police power is and what it can do. It must make the police \npower palatable, justify its actions, and give it its psychosociological \nstructure among the masses of the people.\nAll this is equally true for dictatorial regimes in which police \nand propaganda concentrate on terror, and for democratic regimes \nin which the motion pictures, for example, show the good offices \nof the police and procure it the friendly feeling of the public. The \nvicious circle mentioned by Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt (past terror \naccentuates present propaganda, and present propaganda paves \nthe way for future terror) is as true of democratic as of dictatorial \nregimes, if the term terror is replaced by efficiency.\nThis type of police organization is not an arbitrary prospect. It is \nmaintained by every authoritarian government, where every citizen \nis regarded as a suspect ignorant of his own capabilities. It is the \ntendency in the United States, and we are beginning to see the first \nelements of it in France. The administration of the French police \nwas oriented, in 1951, toward an organization of the system “in \ndepth.” This took place, for example, at the level of the Record \nOffice. Certain elements of this are simple and well known: finger­\nprint files, records of firearms, application of statistical methods \nwhich allow the police to obtain in a minimum of time the most \nvaried kinds of information and to know from day to day the current\n\f\nTHE CHAHACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE10 2 )\nstate of criminality in all its forms. Other elements are somewhat \nmore complicated and new. For example, a punched-card mechan­\nical index system (Recherches) has been installed in the Criminal \nDivision. This system oifers four hundred possible combinations \nand permits investigations to begin with any element of the \ncrime: hour of commission, nature, objects stolen, weapons used, \netc. The combination obviously does not give the solution but a \nseries of approximations.\nThe most important item in this catalogue of police techniques is \nthe creation of the so-called “suspect files,” which show whether the \npolice ever suspected any individual for any reason or at any time \nwhatsoever, even though no legal document or procedure ever \nexisted against him ( from the press conference of M. Baylot, Pre­\nfect of Police, 1951). This means that any citizen who, once in his \nlife, had anything to do with the police, even for noncriminal rea­\nsons, is put under observation— a fact which ought to affect, speak­\ning conservatively, half the adult male population. It is obvious \nthat these lists are only a point of departure, because it will be \ntempting, as well as necessary, to complete the files with all observa­\ntions which may have been collected.\nFinally, this technical conception of the police supposes the \ninstitution of concentration camps, not in their dramatic aspects, \nbut in their administrative aspects. The Nazi’s use of concentration \ncamps has warped our perspectives. The concentration camp is \nbased on two ideas which derive directly from the technical con­\nception of the police: preventive detention (which completes pre­\nvention), and re-education. It is not because the use of these terms \nhas not corresponded to reality that we feel it necessary to refuse to \nsee in the concentration camp a very advanced form of the system. \nNor is it because the so-called methods of re-education have, on the \nwhole, been methods of destruction that we feel we must consider \nsuch a concept of “re-education” an odious joke. The further we \nadvance, the more will the police be considered responsible for the \nre-education of social misfits, a goal that is a part of the very order \nwhich they are charged with protecting.\nWe are experiencing at present the justification of this develop­\nment. It is not true that the perfection of police power is the result \nof the state’s Machiavellianism or of some transitory influence. The \nwhole structure of society implies it, of necessity. The more we mo-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (103\nbilize the forces of nature, the more must we mobilize men and the \nmore do we require order, which today represents the highest value. \nTo deny this is to deny the whole course of modem times. This \norder has nothing spontaneous in it. It is rather a patient accretion \nof a thousand technical details. And each of us derives a feeling of \nsecurity from every one of the improvements which make this \norder more efficient and the future safer. Order receives our com* \nplete approval; even when we are hostile to the police, we are, by a \nstrange contradiction, partisans of order. In the blossoming of \nmodem discoveries and of our own power, a vertigo has taken hold \nof us which makes us feel this need to an extreme degree. After all, \nit is the police who are charged, from die external point of view, \nwith insuring this order which covers organization and morals. How \nthen can we possibly deny to the police indispensable improve­\nments in their methods? •\nWe in France are still in the preparatory phase of this develop­\nment, but the organization of police power has been pushed very \nfar in Canada and New Zealand, to take two examples. Technical \nnecessity imposes the national concentration camp (which, I must \npoint out, does not involve the suffering usually associated with it).\nLet us take another example. A new machine of great productive \npower put into circulation “releases” a great quantity of work; it \nreplaces many workers. This is an inevitable consequence of tech­\nnique. In the crude order of things, these workers are simply thrown \nout of work. Capitalism is blamed for tlus state of affairs and we \nare told that technique itself is not responsible for technological \nunemployment and that the establishment of socialism would set \nthings right. The capitalist replies: “Technological unemployment \nalways dies out of itself. For example, it creates certain new activi­\nties which will in the long run create employment for qualified \nworkers.” This appears to be a dreadful prospect because it implies \na readaptation in time and a more or less lengthy period of un­\nemployment. But what does socialism propose? That the “liberated” \nworker will be used somewhere else and in some other capacity. \nIn the Soviet Union the worker is either adapted to a new skill \nby means of vocational training or he is sent to another part of the \ncountry. In the Beveridge Plan the worker is employed wherever \nthe state opens a plant of any sort. This socialist solution involves \nreadaptation in space. But this solution, too, appears to be com-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEHOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE104)\npletely alien to human nature. Man is not a mere package to be \nmoved about, an object to be molded and applied wherever there is \nneed. These two forms of readaptation, the only ones possible, \nare both inhumane. The New Work Code promulgated in the \n(East) German Democratic Republic in November, i960, shows \nthis inhumanity in operation in the socialist camp. And none of \nthese adaptations can be separated from the machine which re­\nplaces human labor. They are its necessary and inevitable conse­\nquence. Of course, idealists will speak of the reduction of the work \nweek. But this reduction can only be effected when equivalent \ntechnical improvements are produced in all fields of work. Accord­\ning to Colin Clark, it seems that this reduction, too, must “ceiling \nout” before long. But this consideration passes over into the area \nof economics.\nI could cite innumerable examples, but the ones I have given \nsuffice to show that technique in itself (and not the use made of it, \nor its non-necessary consequences) leads to a certain amount of \nsuffering and to social scourges which cannot be completely sepa­\nrated from it. This is its very mechanism.\nOf course, a technique can be abandoned when it proves to have \nevil effects which were not provided for. From then on, there will \nbe an improvement in the technique. A characteristic example is \nfurnished by J. de Castro in The Geography of Hunger. De Castro \nshows in detail, with regard to Brazil, what was already known \nsuperficially about other countries, that certain techniques of ex­\nploitation have proved disastrous. According to de Castro, certain \nregions were deforested in order to grow sugar cane. But only the \nimmediate technical productivity was considered. In a further \nwork, de Castro seeks to show that the hunger problem was created\nfine? rolonialict' In aarin tltu rfi.\nj  r r  “  v * ’ t  ■  ■  ................*  ~ j  ■ \"  o  ■\nHis reasoning, however, is correct only to a very limited extent. It \nis true that when an agriculture of diversified crops is replaced by \na single-crop economy for commercial ends (tobacco and sugar \ncane), capitalism is to blame. But most often crop diversification is \nnot disturbed. What happens is that new areas are brought under \ncultivation, producing a population increase and also a unilateral \nutilization of the labor forces. And this is less a capitalist than a \ntechnical fact. If the possibility of industrializing agriculture exists, \nwhy not use it? Any engineer, agronomist, or economist of a hun-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 10 5\ndred years ago would have agreed that bringing uncultivated \nlands under cultivation constituted a great advance. The applica­\ntion of European agricultural techniques represented an incom­\nparable forward step, when compared, for example, to Indian \nmethods. But it involved certain unforeseen consequences: the re­\nsulting deforestation modified hydrographic features, the rivers \nbecame torrents, and the drainage waters provoked catastrophic \nerosion. The topsoil was completely carried away and agriculture \nbecame impossible. The fauna, dependent on the existence of the \nforest, disappeared. In this way, the food-producing possibilities of \nvast regions vanished. The same situation is developing as a result \nof the cultivation of peanuts in Senegal, of cotton in the South of \nthe United States, and so on. None of this represents, as is com­\nmonly said, a poor application of technique— one guided by selfish \ninterest. It is simply technique. And if the situation is rectified “too \nlate\" by the abandonment of the old technique, it will only be as a \nconsequence of some new technical advance. In any case, the first \nstep was inevitable; man can never foresee the totality of conse­\nquences of a given technical action. History shows that every tech­\nnical application from its beginnings presents certain unforeseeable \nsecondary effects which are much more disastrous than the lack of \nthe technique would have been. These effects exist alongside those \neffects which were foreseen and expected and which represent \nsomething valuable and positive.\nTechnique demands the most rapid possible application; the \nproblems of our day are evolving rapidly and require immediate \nsolutions. Modern man is held by the throat by certain demands \nwhich will not be resolved simply by the passage of time. The \nquickest possible counter-thrust, often a matter of life or death, is \nnecessary. When the parry specific to the attack is found, it is used. \nIt would be foolish not to use the available means. But there is \nnever time to estimate all the repercussions. And, in any case, they \nare most often unforeseeable. The more we understand the inter­\nrelation of all disciplines and the interaction of the instruments, \nthe less time there is to measure these effects accurately.\nMoreover, technique demands the most immediate application \nbecause it is so expensive. It must “pay off,” in money, prestige, \nor force (depending on whether the regime is capitalist, Com­\nmunist, or Fascist, respectively). There is no time for precautions\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE106)\nwhen the distribution of dividends or the salvation of the prole­\ntariat is at stake. Nor can we permit ourselves to say that these \nmotives are no affair of technique. If none of them existed, there \nwould be no money for technical research and there would be no \ntechnique. Technique cannot be considered in itself, apart from its \nactual modes of existence.\nWe are brought back, then, to serious facts of this order: in \ncertain agricultural research in England, antiparasitic agents called \nsystemics were applied. An injection was made into a fruit tree, \nwhich as a consequence was infected with the agent from its \nroots to its leaves. Every parasite died. But nothing is known of the \neffects on the fruit, or of the effects on man, and in the long run of \nthe effects on the tree. All that is known is that the agent is not an \nimmediate deadly poison for the consumer. Such products are al­\nready commercially available, and it is probable that they will \nshortly be used on a large scale. What we have said about systemics \nholds for the specific insecticide, D.D.T. It was announced origi­\nnally that this insecticide was completely harmless for warm­\nblooded animals. Subsequently, D.D.T. was widely used. But it \nwas noted in 1951 that D.D.T. in fatty solution (oily or otherwise) \nis actually a poison for warm-blooded animals and causes a whole \ncomplex of disturbances and diseases, in particular, rickets. This \nfatty solution may be produced entirely by accident, as when cows \ntreated with this chemical produce milk containing D.D.T. Rickets \nhas been detected in calves nourished with such milk. And several \ninternational medical congresses since 1956 have drawn attention \nto the grave danger to children.\nBut the real question is not the question of error. Errors are \nalways possible. Two facts alone concern us: it is impossible to \nforesee all the consequences of a technical action; and technique \ndemands that everything it produces be brought into a domain that \naffects the entire public.\nThe weight of technique is such that no obstacle can stop it. And \nevery technical advance is matched by a negative reverse side. An \nexcellent study of the effect of petroleum explorations in the Sahara \n(1958) concludes with the observation that the most serious prob­\nlem is the increase in the wretchedness of the local population. The \ncauses of this growing misery, among others, are: the supplanting of \ncaravan traffic by motor vehicles; the disappearance of the date\n\f\nThe Technological Society (107\npalms (diseased through widespread chemical wastes); and the \ndisappearance of cereal grains because of nonmaintenance of the \nirrigation works. This complex seems to represent a typical example.\nThe human being is delivered helpless, in respect to life’s most \nimportant and most trivial affairs, to a power which is in no sense \nunder his control. For there can be no question today of man’s con­\ntrolling the milk he drinks or the bread he eats, any more than of his \ncontrolling his government. The same holds for the development of \ngreat industrial plants, transport systems, motion pictures, and so \non. It is only after a period of dubious experimentation that a tech­\nnique is refined and its secondary consequences are modified \nthrough a series of technical improvements. Henceforth, someone \nwill say, it will be possible to tame the monster and separate the \ngood results of a technical operation from the bad. That may be. \nBut, in the same framework, the new technical advance will in its \nturn produce further secondary and unpredictable effects which are \nno less disastrous than the preceding ones (aithough they will be of \nanother kind). De Castro declares that the new techniques of soil \ncultivation presuppose more and more powerful state control, with \nits police power, its ideology, and its propaganda machinery. This \nis the price we must pay.\nWilliam Vogt, surveying the same problem, is still more precise: \nin order to avoid famine, resulting from the systematic destruction \nof the topsoil, we must apply the latest technical methods. But con­\nservation will not be put into practice spontaneously by individuals; \nyet, these methods must be applied globally or they will not amount \nto anything. Who can do this? Vogt, like all good Americans, asserts \nthat he detests the authoritarian police state. However, he agrees \nthat only state controls can possibly produce the desired results. He \nextols the efforts made by the liberal administration of the United \nStates in this respect, but he agrees that the United States continues \n“to lose ground literally and figuratively,” simply' because the \nmethods of American agricultural administration are not authori­\ntarian enough.\nWhat measures are to be recommended? The various soils must \nbe classified as to possible ways to cultivate them without destroy­\ning them. Authoritarian methods must be applied in order (a) to \nevacuate the population and to prevent it from working the im­\nperiled soil; and (b) to grow only certain products on certain types"

This evolution is to be facilitated by centralization of the \ngreat land holdings. In Latin America there are today from 20 to 40 \nmillion ecologically displaced persons, persons occupying lands \nwhich ought not to be under cultivation.They are living on hillsides \nfrom which it is absolutely necessary to drive them if the means of \nexistence of their countries are to be saved from destruction. It will \nbe difficult and costly to relocate these people, but Latin America \nhas no choice. If she does not solve this problem, she will be re­\nduced to the most miserable standard of living.\nAll experts on agricultural questions are in fact in fundamental \nagreement. De Castro (although hostile to the ideas of Vogt) and \nDumont (critical of de Castro on certain points) come to the con­\nclusion that only strict planning on a world scale can solve the prob­\nlems of agriculture, and that only human relocation and collective \ndistribution of wealth can solve the problem of famine. This can \nonly mean that man, if he is to improve the traditional agricultural \ntechniques and be rid of their drawbacks, will be obliged to apply \nextremely rigorous administrative and police techniques. Here again \nwe have a good example of the interconnection of different elements \nand of the unpredictability of the secondary effects.\nIt was believed for a long time that the TVA was a praiseworthy \nresponse to certain problems raised by technique. Today, however, \ncertain major flaws have become apparent. For example, the correct \napplication of methods of reforestation and animal reproduction \nwere not understood. Flood control was not carried out by retention \nof the water in the soil but by submerging permanently a good part \nof the lands which have been saved to protect others. Man, we \nrepeat, is never able to foresee the totality of effects of his tech­\nnique. No one could have foreseen that regulating the Colorado \nRiver for irrigation purposes would lead the Pacific Ocean to en­\ncroach upon the coast of California, or that it would endanger \nthe valleys (which had been “regulated”) by the removal of up to \n500 tons a day of sand and rock. It is likewise impossible to foresee \nthe effect of techniques intended to control the weather, dispel \nclouds, precipitate rain or snow, and so on. In another area, \nProfessor Lemaire, in a study of narcotic drugs, shows that tech­\nnique permits the manufacture of synthetic narcotics with greater \nand greater ease and in increasing quantities. But, according to\n\f\nThe Technological Society (109\nLemaire, the control of these drugs is thereby rendered more and \nmore difficult because “we cannot predict whether they will or \nwill not be dangerous. The only proof is their habitual use by \naddicts. But to obtain this proof requires y ears of experience.*\nThere is scarcely need to recall that universal famine, the most \nserious danger known to humanity,* is caused by the advance of \ncertain medical techniques which have brought with them good and \nevil inextricably mixed. This is not a question of good or bad use. \nNo more so is the problem, posed by atomic techniques, of the dis­\nposal of atomic waste. Atomic explosions are not the real problem. \nThe real problem continues to be that of the disposal of the \nceaselessly accumulating waste materials, despite the reassuring \nbut unfortunately partisan explanations of some atomic scientists. \nThe International Agency for Atomic Energy recognized, in 1959, \nthat these wastes represent a deadly peril and that there is no sure \nway of avoiding it, except perhaps by means of the difficult process \nof \"vitrification” being undertaken in Canada. And all this involves \nthe peaceful use of the atom!\nIn every case, what can really be foreseen more or less clearly is \nthe need of state intervention to control the effects of technical \napplications. But by the time a technique is modified in the light \nof these effects, the evil has already been done. When it is proposed \nto “choose* between effects, it is always too late. It is doubtless still \npossible to modify any given element, but only at the price 0i \nsecondary repercussions. Again, it is doubtless possible to produce, \nby means of rational exploitation of natural resources, enough food \nto nourish five billion human beings. But this can be accomplished \nonly at the price of forced labor and a new kind of slavery. What­\never point we choose to examine, we always perceive this inter­\nrelation of techniques. In i960, the World Congress for the Study of \nNutrition considered the problem of how modem nutrition is viti­\nated by the use of chemical products which are themselves sig­\nnificant contributory causes of the so-called diseases of civilization \n(cancer, cardiovascular illnesses, etc.). But the Congress’s studies \nindicate that the solution can no longer be a return to a “natural* \nnutrition. On the contrary, a further step must be taken which \ninvolves completely artificial alimentation, so-called rational ali-\n•That this problem  can be solved seem s doubtful to m ost recent congresses, the Vevey Congress of i960 am ong them.\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OP TECHNIQUE1 1 0 )\nmentation. It will not be sufficient merely to control grains, meat, \nbutter, and so forth. The stage at which this would have been \nfeasible has been passed. New technical methods must be found. \nBut can we be assured that this new alimentation will in its turn \npresent no danger?\nEvery rejection of a technique judged to be bad entails the appli­\ncation of a new technique, the value of which is estimated from the \npoint of view of efficiency alone. But we are always unaware of the \nmore remote repercussions. History shows us that these are seldom \npositive, at least when we consider history as a whole instead of \ncontenting ourselves with examining disconnected phenomena such \nas the population increase, the prolongation of the average life \nspan, or the shortening of the work week. These are symptoms \nwhich perhaps would have meaning if man were merely an animal, \nbut which have no conclusive significance if man is something more \nthan a production machine.\nHowever, it is not my intention to show that technique will end in \ndisaster. On the contrary, technique has only one principle: efficient \nordering. Everything, for technique, is centered on the concept of \norder. This explains the development of moral and political doc­\ntrines at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Everything which \nrepresented an ordering principle was taken in deadly earnest. At \nthe same time the means destined to elaborate this order were \nexploited as never before. Order and peace were required for the \ndevelopment of the individual techniques (after society had \nreached the necessary stage of disintegration). Peace is indispensa­\nble to the triumph of industrialization. It will be hastily concluded \nfrom this that industrialization will promote peace. But, as always, \nlogical deductions falsify reality. J. U. Nef has shown admirably \nthat industrialization cannot act otherwise than to promote wars. \nThis is no accident, but rather an organic relation. It holds not only \nbecause of the direct influence of industrialization on the means of \ndestruction but also because of its influence on the means of ex­\nistence. Technical progress favors war, according to Nef, because \n(a) the new weapons have rendered more difficult the distinction \nbetween offense and defense; and (b) they have enormously re­\nduced the pain and anguish implied in the act of killing.\nOn another plane, the distinction between peaceful industry and \nmilitary industry is no longer possible.

It has a “mass” which \nrenders it monistic. To show this we have taken only the simplest, \nand hence the most easily debatable, examples. To enable the \nreader to grasp fully the reality of this monism, it would be neces­\nsary to present every problem with all its implications and ramifi­\ncations into other fields. The case of the police, for example, cannot \nbe considred merely within its specific confines; police technique \nis closely connected with the techniques of propaganda, adminis­\ntration, and even economics. Economics demands, in effect, an \nincreasing productivity; it is impossible to accept the nonproducers \ninto the body social— the loafers, the coupon-clippers, the social \nmisfits, and the saboteurs— none of these have any place. The police \nmust develop methods to put these useless consumers to work. The \nproblem is the same in a capitalist state (where the Communist is \nthe saboteur) and in a Communist state (where the saboteur is the \ninternationalist in the pay of capitalism).\nThe necessities and the modes of action of all these techniques \ncombine to form a whole, each part supporting and reinforcing the \nothers. They constitute a co-ordinated phenomenon, no element of \nwhich can be detached from the others. It is an illusion, a perfectly \nunderstandable one, to hope to be able to suppress the “bad” side \nof technique and preserve the “good.” This belief means that the \nessence of the technical phenomenon has not been grasped.\nThe Necessary Linking Together of Techniques. We have seen \nhow the two technical characteristics, self-augmentation and \nmonism, combine. Now we must consider the historical, necessary \nlinking up of all the different techniques. This analysis will complete \nmy discussion of these two characteristics.\nMachine technique appeared after 1750. The technical state of \nmind was first manifested in the application of the principles of \nscience. We already know how this necessity arose (it is emphasized \nin all textbooks). The flying shuttle of 1733 made a greater pro-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE1 1 1 )\nduction of yarn necessary. But production was impossible without \na suitable machine. The response to this dilemma was the invention \nof the spinning jenny by James Hargreaves. But then yarn was \nproduct*! in much greater quantities than could possibly be used \nby the weavers. To solve this new problem, Cartwright manu­\nfactured his celebrated loom. In this series of events we see in its \nsimplest form the interaction that accelerates the development of \nmachines. Each new machine disturbs the equilibrium of pro­\nduction; the restoration of equilibrium entails the creation of one \nor more additional machines in other areas of operation.\nProduction becomes more and more complex. The combination \nof machines within the same enterprise, is a notable characteristic of \nthe nineteenth century. It is impossible, in effect, to have an isolated \nmachine. There must be adjunct machines, if not preparatory ones. \nThis need, which is not clearly evident in the textile industry (a \nloom is relatively self-sufficient), is singularly well defined in the \nmetallurgical industry. Fabrication in this area consists of multiple \ninseparable operations. For each of these operations, one or more \nmachines are needed. This gives rise to a complex enterprise which \ndemands the application of the organization of production. The \nneed for organization of machines is found even in the textile \nindustry. A large number of looms must be grouped together in \norder to utilize the prime mover most effectively, since no indi­\nvidual loom consumes very much energy. To obtain maximum yield, \nmachines cannot be disposed in a haphazard way. Nor can produc­\ntion take place irregularly. A plan must be followed in all technical \ndomains. And this plan, which becomes more and more inflexible in \nproportion to increasing production, is the product of a technique \nof organization and of operation.\nOrganizational technique was still very sketchy at the beginning \nof the nineteenth century. But with the increase in the number of \nmanufactured products, new commercial methods had to be \ncreated. Capital, labor, producers, and consumers had to be found. \nThree new kinds of technique emerged: commercial, industrial, \nand transportational. Commercial techniques developed at the \nbeginning of the nineteenth century with the same velocity as \nindustrial techniques. These commercial techniques exploited all \nthe old systems which had previously existed sporadically and\n\f\nThe Technological Society (113\nwithout much vigor. Bills of exchange, banks, clearing houses, \ndouble-entry bookkeeping, and the like, were further developed.\nThe need to distribute manufactured goods thus acted to produce \na powerful commercial technique, which, however, proved to be \nincapable of assuring proper distribution. The accumulation of \ncapital (produced by the machine and also necessitated by it) be­\ncame tlie source of an international financial organization, with \nits systems of great firms, insurance, credit, and the corporation \nwith limited liabilities. The corporation was indispensable in view \nof die magnitude of the commercial traffic generated by sheer \nconcentration.\nBut the two systems, commercial and financial, were only able \nto function at full capacity if they were in a position to dispose of \ntheir merchandise at the most favorable point, as determined by \ncommercial techniques. This implied the rapid, regular, and certain \ntransport of merchandise. Hence, systems of transport had to be \nassured if financial and commercial techniques were to be able to \noperate. A new technique came into being, transport, which was \nnot a direct result of the machine. It was a separate branch; and \norganization played a greater role in it than the machine itself (in \nrailway routes and timetables, problems of eminent domain, etc.).\nAt the period this technical torrent was emerging from industrial \nenterprise, a crowd of human beings began to gather about the \nmachine. A great number of individuals were necessary to service \nit; an equally great number were required to collect about it to com- \nsume its products. The first great change consisted in forcing the \nconsumer to come to the machine, inasmuch as adequate means of \ntransportation were to come fifty years too late. With this develop­\nment came the hitherto unknown phenomenon of the big city. \nAt the beginning, the big city engendered no particular technique; \npeople were merely unhappy in it But it soon appeared that mega­\nlopolis represented a new and special kind of environment, calling \nfor special treatment. The technique of city planning made its ap­\npearance. At first, urban planning was only a clumsy kind of adap­\ntation which was little concerned, for example, with slums (despite \nthe efforts of the utopian planners of the middle of the century). \nSomewhat later, as big city life became for the most part intolera­\nble, techniques of amusement were developed. It became indis­\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEHOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE\npensable to make urban suffering acceptable by furnishing amuse­\nments, a necessity which was to assure the rise, for example, of a \nmonstrous motion-picture industry.\nThis phase of development was still dominated by the machine, \nand corresponded to what Mumford has called the paleotechnical \nperiod. During this period the instruments of the power mentality \ndeveloped. It became apparent that mechanical improvements \nalone do not suffice to yield socially valuable results. This was \nclearly a period of transition in which inventions had not yet com­\npletely overthrown the older institutions. And they had not yet \ntouched human life, except indirectly. It was a period of disorder. \nAnd the most glaring manifestation of this disorder was man’s ex­\nploitation of man. This disorder, however, led to a strenuous search \nfor order, which developed first in the economic field. For some \ntime it had been possible to believe that the increasing flow of \nmerchandise would be absorbed automatically. But the illusions \nof liberalism collapsed very quickly. Little by little, the liberal \nsystem broke down before the profusion of goods which the ma­\nchine blindly poured forth. It was inescapable that only technical \nmethods of distribution would be able to cope with the problems \ncreated by technical methods of production. There was no way \naround it. A mechanism of distribution and consumption was nec­\nessary, as precise as the mechanism of production, which itself was \nnot yet sufficiently precise, merely because it was mechanical. It \nwas imperative that the different parts of the productive mecha­\nnism be adjusted and that the goods produced correspond exactly \nto the need, in quantity as well as in quality. It was no-longer suffi­\ncient to organize enterprise. The entire production had to be \norganized in all its details. And if production were completely or­\nganized, there could be no question of allowing consumption \n(which had, in the meantime, become mechanized) to operate \nwithout its own world-wide organization. These logical interac­\ntions, which emerged first on the national level, were soon found \non the international level as well.\nThe development of this mechanism inevitably implied the most \nperfect possible economic technique. This economic technique in \nturn would permit the utilization of new machines. Reciprocally, \ncertain other instruments would facilitate the improvement of the \neconomic technique. Moreover, nothing could be left to chance,\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 115\nin this kind of organization; the labor supply in particular could not \nbe entrusted to the whim of the individual. Economic organization \npresupposes a technique of labor. ( The precise form of this tech­\nnique is of little consequence to us here. We are interested only in \nthe principle.) Labor had to be systematized; it had to become \nscientific. Thus, of necessity a new technique was added to the pre­\nceding ones. But at the same time it became mandatory to com­\npensate the workers for the fatigue generated by technical labor. \nHere we meet again the necessity for additional mass amusement \n— a necessity which the existence of the big city had already pro­\nvoked. The cycle was inevitable.\nThe whole edifice was constructed little by little, and all its indi­\nvidual techniques were improved by mutual interaction. Before \nlong, however, the need for still another instrument appeared. Who \nwas to co-ordinate this multiplicity of techniques? Who was to \nbuild the mechanism necessary to the new economic technique? \nWho was to make binding the decisions necessary to service the \nmachines? The individual is not by himself rational enough to ac­\ncept what is necessary to the machines. He rebels too easily. He \nrequires an agency to constrain him, and the state had to play this \nrole— but the state now could not be the incoherent, powerless, and \narbitrary state of tradition. It had to be an effective state, equal to \nthe functioning of the economic regime and in control of every­\nthing, to the end that machines which had developed at random \nshould become “coherent.” To this end, the state itself must be \ncoherent. Thus, the techniques of the state— military, police, ad­\nministrative, and political— made their appearance. Without them, \nall the rest would have been no more than faint hopes unable to at­\ntain maximum development. They intermingled, necessitating one \nanother, and all of them necessitated by the economy.\nIt soon became evident that such external action was insufficient. \nA  great effort was required of the individual, and this effort he \ncould not make unless he was genuinely convinced, not merely \nconstrained. He must be made to yield his heart and will, as he had \nyielded his body and brain. And so the techniques of propaganda, \neducation, and psychic manipulation came to reinforce the others. \nWithout them, man could scarcely have been equal to his organiza­\ntions and his machines. Without them, technique could not have \nbeen completely certain of its operation. To the degree that material\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUEll6)\ntechniques became more precise, intellectual and psychic tech­\nniques became more necessary. By these means man acquired the \nconviction and strength needed to make possible the maximum \nutilization of the others. So the edifice was completed.\nIt is impossible to amputate a part of the system or to modify it \nin any way without modifying the whole. The system was not built \nthrough whim or personal ambition. Its factors were all reciprocally \nengendered.\nIn this description we have constantly encountered the term \nnecessity; it is necessity which characterizes the technical uni­\nverse. Everything must accommodate itself to it with mathematical \ncertainty. Every successive technique has appeared because the \nones which preceded it rendered necessary the ones which fol­\nlowed. Otherwise they would have been inefficacious and would \nnot have been able to deliver their maximum yield.\nIt is useless to hope for modification of a system like this— so com­\nplex and precisely adjusted that no single part can be modified by \nitself. Moreover, the system perfects and completes itself unremit­\ntingly. And, except in print, I see no sign of any modification of the \ntechnical edifice, no principle of a different social organization that \nwould not be founded on technical necessity.\nTechnical Unioersalism. This characteristic of the technical phe­\nnomenon manifests itself under two aspects, the first geographic \nand the second qualitative.\nFrom the geographic point of view, it is easy to see that tech­\nnique is constantly gaining ground, country by country, and that \nits area of action is the whole world. In all countries, whatever \ntheir degree of “civilization,’*  there is a tendency to apply the same \ntechnical procedures. Even when the population of a given country \nis not completely assimilated technically, it is nevertheless able to \nuse the instruments which technique puts into its hands. The peo­\nple of these countries have no need to be Westernized. Technique, \nto be used, does not require a “civilized” man. Technique, what­\never hand uses it, produces its effect more or less totally in propor­\ntion to the individual’s more or less total absorption in it.\nVogt emphasizes this fact, for example, when he shows that in \nthe domain of agriculture the most up-to-date techniques have be­\ncome universal. Never before, says Vogt, has man destroyed his \nnatural environment “with the inexorableness of an armored divi-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (117\nsion. These ‘civilized’ forces of destruction, which have been de­\nveloped under our influence, have conquered the entire globe to \nsuch a degree that Malays, Hottentots and Ainos are spreading the \nplague.”\nIn the course of history there have always been different princi­\nples of civilization according to regions, nations, and continents. \nBut today everything tends to align itself on technical principles. \nIn the past, different civilizations took different “paths”; today all \npeoples follow the same road and the same impulse. This does not \nmean that they have all reached the same point, but they are situ­\nated at different points along the same trajectory. The United \nStates represents the type that France will represent in thirty years, \nand China in possibly eighty. All the business of life, from work \nand amusement to love and death, is seen from the technical point \nof view. The number of “technical slaves” is growing rapidly, and \nthe ideal of all governments is to push as fast as possible toward \nindustrialization and technical enslavement.\nI am well acquainted with the perfectly valid arguments which \nturn on economic necessity and the misery of the so-called “back­\nward” peoples. But the problem is not the process involved; it is \nsimply to note that different societies are adopting Western tech­\nnique. The Vevey Congress of i960 forcefully emphasized this \npoint. Although, understandably, the primary problem of the un­\nderdeveloped peoples is undernourishment, obsession with tech­\nnique has befuddled them to such a point that what they are de­\nmanding, and what we are offering, is the very industrialization \nthat will aggravate the evil. Technique is the same in all latitudes \nand hence acts to make different civilizations uniform. This tend­\nency arises directly from technique itself. The Oriental, Russian, \nand South American societies were by no means historically pre­\npared, as was ours, to favor technical development\nThe best sociologists have noted that technique involves die \nsame effects everywhere. R. P. Lynton writes: “The industrializa­\ntion of a community of Europe or America, on the one hand; or of \nSiam, Nigeria, Turkey, or Uruguay, on the other, poses the same \nproblems.” If the technical movement had had its inception in one \nof these “backward” countries, it would have aborted. But these \nsocieties are presented with a technical movement in full vigor and \nin all its expansive power. No longer is there any question as to\n\f\nTHE CHAtUCTEnOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE118)\nwhether circumstances favorable to its flowering exist. The tech­\nnical movement is strong enough to impose itself and to break down \nall barriers to its progress.\nBut why does this expansion exist at all? Until now it was gen­\nerally accepted that very similar social environments were neces­\nsary if propagation of techniques were to occur. This is no longer \ntrue. Today technique imposes itself, whatever the environment. \nThis expansive force can be explained by a whole ensemble of \nhistorical reasons (more or less superficial, though true), and by \none profound reason ( to be examined later on).\nThe historical reasons are bound up with two great currents \nwhich have occasioned the technical invasion:  commerce and war. \nColonial war opened the door to those European nations that \npossessed the whole complex of technical means. The conquering \nnations exported their machines and their organization through \ntheir armies. The vanquished peoples, in a state of mind com­\npounded of admiration and fear, adopted the machines, which \ncame to replace their gods. Not only were the machines the means \ntheir conquerors had used to subdue them, but the machines repre­\nsented the possible means for liberation from these conquerors. In \nthese colonies traffic in arms and in all the instruments of power \nbegan to flourish as a means of provoking insurrection. At first, \nrebellion was incoherent, but to the degree that these peoples be­\ncame better organized and technicized, rebellion became a national \naffair.\nWar also involved the backward peoples globally. I have in \nmind not so much the direct effects of colonial war as the effects of \nwars among so-called civilized nations. The colonies of Germany \nand France became involved in the war between these nations. \nLater on, China and Siberia came in. Yakuts rode in tanks in the \nfront line of the Red Army. War provokes the sudden and stupefy­\ning adaptation of the “savage” to machinery and discipline.\nThe second factor governing technical invasion is commerce. It \nwas mandatory for the Western powers to conquer the markets \nnecessary for Western industry and technical life. No barrier could \noppose this necessity; and primitive peoples were literally \nswamped by the products of modem technique. In 1945 the Ameri­\ncans sent tons of individual military rations to the Bulgarians, who \nhad no desire at all to adapt themselves to a new kind of butter and\n\f\nThe Technological Society (119\nto other substitutes. But their resistance necessarily yielded to tech­\nnical adaptation and, very rapidly, to plain abundance. The exces­\nsiveness of the means broke down all traditional and individual \ndesires.\nAfter consumer goods came an invasion of productive tech­\nniques. Technical invasion is a question not only of colonialism but \nalso, for the less powerful countries, of simple technical subordina­\ntion. This, and this only, explains the formation of the two blocs \ntoday. All political or economic explanations are superficial and \nridiculous. There are two great technical powers, the United States \nand the Soviet Union. Every other country must subordinate itself \nto one or the other of the two simply because of their technical \nsuperiority. Technical invasion is not exclusively colonial in­\nvasion but assumes other forms as well.\nThe phenomenon of present-day decolonialization is closely re­\nlated to the possibilities of the technical development of peoples \nwho, up to now, have lived in symbiosis with colonial powers. From \nthe very moment of \"independence,” these peoples are constrained \nto appeal for assistance to the two major powers; after all, they can­\nnot possibly be self-sufficient on the technical plane. The major \npowers then equip them in a “disinterested” way. In fact, of course, \nthe major powers have no choice if they cherish any hope at all that \nthe poverty of these new “free” nations will not make them theatres \nof endemic war (not to mention the fact that the major powers are \nthemselves in competition). Thus, the best and most moral inten­\ntions (as, for example, Harry S. Truman’s Point Four aid to colonial \nlands) lead to a rapid technicization of the world; and every polit­\nical phenomenon accelerates this technicization, which necessarily \nassumes a Western look.\nThe expensive factors are clearly favored by the elementary \ntechnical facts. Consider, for example, the speed and thoroughness \nof the means of communication, which permit technical products \nto be transported anywhere in the world soon after their appear­\nance in the country of origin. The result of this must be speedy \nunification.\nThe very means of communication presuppose such unification. \nGreat ocean-going vessels necessitate continually improved port \ninstallations everywhere. Railroads demand identical roadbeds in \nall countries. Aviation requires a whole technical substructure.\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE130 )\nwhich is becoming more important day by day and which must be­\ncome ever more uniform as tonnage and speed increase.\nThe creation of the port of Lavera, near Port-de-Bouc, is a case \nin point. To construct a harbor for oil tankers to meet the de­\nmands of the French market, it was necessary to conform exactly \nto the international requirements of petroleum shipping. These de­\nmands are wholly technical: depth of channel for modem tank­\ners of more than 30,000 tons, special docks, relay reservoirs fitted \nwith technical improvements exactly adapted to the tankers, and \nso on. It was clearly impossible to continue to do without these \nfacilities. In French home ports today, the petroleum brought in \nby the large tankers must first be discharged by small lighters to \nplants which are either floating installations or of insufficient pump­\ning capacity. This results in loss of time and excessive handling. \nEvery ton of crude oil bears an extra burden of approximately \nthree dollars. These factors are clear and are leading to the accept­\nance of the most modem procedures— which reciprocally contrib­\nutes to world-wide technical unification.\nThere is still another element in the mechanism of technical \nexpansion: the export of technicians. This is not only a question of \nGerman technicians going, for example, to the United States or to \nRussia. (This exodus, incidentally, was accompanied by a certain \ntechnical flowering which rendered German technique truly in­\nternational.) There is the same diffusion of American technique to \nunderdeveloped countries by the application of President Truman's \nPoint Four Program. Academicians are supplied who are charged \nwith blueprinting the future of underdeveloped peoples. (This \nform of technical assistance assimilates intellectually the inhabi­\ntants of the countries in question.) In addition, the United States \ndirectly supplies the necessary technicians for exploiting the natu­\nral resources of these countries. The immediate purpose is to raise \nthe standard of living of the population, beginning with a realistic \nappraisal of the possibilities of the given country, and the final ob­\njective is a perfectly humanitarian one; we can refrain from passing \njudgment on whether American imperialism is involved. Neverthe­\nless, this leads to a diffusion of techniques throughout the world in \nan accelerated tempo, and at the same time it leads to technical \nidentity in all countries.\nA certain educational unity is also involved here.

This leads to the extension of European-style \neducation, allows the colored peoples to participate actively in \nscientific progress, and provokes as a consequence a kind of a \npriori adhesion to technical diffusion. Since 1956 we have been \nwitnessing the same diffusion of technicians from the Soviet Union, \nand more recently from China, to Syria, Guinea, Ghana, and Cuba. \nWithout entertaining political suspicions of these acts, let us bear \nin mind only that these factors, among others, are an active aid to \ntechnical invasion.\nTechnical invasion does not involve the simple addition of new \nvalues to old ones. It does not put new wine into old bottles; it \ndoes not introduce new content into old forms. The old bottles are \nall being broken. The old civilizations collapse on contact with the \nnew. And the same phenomenon appears under every possible cul­\ntural form. Take, for example, religion. We have seen one religion \ndisappear under our very eyes as a result of a technical fact: Mi­\nkado worship vanished after the bomb was dropped at Hiroshima. \nWe are witnessing the collapse of Buddhism under Communist \npressure in Tibet and China. And, according to recent studies. \nBuddhism is vanishing for technical reasons, not because of the \nideological effect of Communism. The phenomenon is due, on the \none hand, to a brutal and massive infusion of industrial techniques \nand, on the other, to the use of propaganda techniques which en­\ntail the abandonment of religion by the ever growing population. \nIn a certain sense these religious people are not left without reli­\ngion. To their transcendental religion a “social” religion is opposed, \na religion which is but an expression of technical progress.\nEven the most classically oriented sociologists today recognize \nthat the impact of techniques is producing a collapse of the non- \nWestem civilizations. This involves the collapse of cultural as well \nas of economic forms, and of the traditional psychological and \nsociological structures.\nUNESCO has been greatly preoccupied with these questions, \nand both the Bulletin of the Social Sciences and the reports of Dr. \nMargaret Mead strike an alarming note. Investigators find, in effect, \nthat it is easy to transfer technical procedures, but that the elabora­\ntion of sociological and psychological methods of controlling them \nis slow, difficult, and laborious.\n\f\n1 2  2 )  THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE\nOne is always running up against the simple-minded tendency \nto say, as Charles F. Frankel puts it, that \"it is sufficient to give \ntechnical procedures and their accumulated blessings to the back­\nward peoples in order to put them on their feet, as one might give \nan injection to a sick man.” This kind of injection may conceivably \nhelp. But in giving it, we destroy the traditional ways of life. Tech­\nnique does not, of itself, carry its own equilibrium. The opposite is \nnearer the truth. We have seen in the West how technique des­\ntroyed communities and brought the relevance of the human being \ninto question, even though technique was born in the Western \nmilieu and grew only slowly. How much more formidable are its \neffects when it is suddenly implanted in a foreign environment, ap­\npearing in all its power at a single stroke. In Africa the worker is \nseparated from his family and, as S. Herbert Frankel says, “his \nsocial ego remains attached to the rural group while he himself has \nbeen transplanted into an industrial milieu. When his family comes \nto the city they are completely unprepared for urban life and are \ndestroyed in that environment morally and sociologically.” In \nAustralia we find the same collapse of the traditional way of life. \nA. P. Elkin says: “In the tribe, authority belonged to the eld­\ners . . . but it is now in process of passing to the corral boss, \nor to the ranch owner. . . . The mysterious rites, which are asso­\nciated with the succession of the seasons and with the search for \nfood, and which in the past occupied a great deal of time, are tend­\ning to lose their meaning.” It would be easy enough to give many \nmore examples.\nEvery culture must be considered as a whole. The transformation \nof a given element through the effect of technique produces shocks \nin all areas. All the peoples of the world today live in a cultural \nbreakdown provoked by the conflicts and the internal strife re­\nsulting from technique. Over and above this— as Margaret Mead \npoints out— since every human being incorporates in his own per­\nson the cultural environment in which he lives, its disagreements \nand incoherences are to be met with again in each individual \npersonality.\nMoreover, we are poorly equipped to respond to this cultural \ncollapse. We have few studies of the mentality and the needs of \nthese peoples, and even fewer studies of their psychological reac­\ntions to technique. We have no studies of the social and adminis-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (123\ntrative measures that might meet their needs, or of their changes \nin aptitudes. We never send along with our technique any civilized \nenvironment or adaptable value capable of replacing what is being \ndestroyed. This, at any rate, is the diagnosis of UNESCO, an \nagency generally characterized by optimism.\nThe situation is being studied now, but for the most part we are \ntoo late. All the instruments ought long since to have been pre­\npared, for no natural adaptation or spontaneous reorganization can \nbe counted upon. No hope of this exists. We have no instruments \nready. And while the problem is being studied, the ravages of \ntechnique are making steady inroads. We are in a veritable race, \nbut it is evident that we are beaten before we begin. The effects of \ntechnique are already too far advanced for us to begin again at \nthe beginning. There is no doubt that all the traditional cultures \nand sociological structures will be destroyed by technique before \nwe can discover or invent social, economic, and psychological \nforms of adaptation which might possibly have preserved the \nequilibrium of these peoples and societies.\nIn the political sphere the phenomenon takes the form of the \nbrutal transition from elementary forms of society to the fully \ndeveloped modem dictatorship. A major part of the world’s popu­\nlation has passed in a few years from serfdom or feudalism to the \nmost punctilious dictatorial state, by virtue and necessity of pro­\nductive and administrative techniques. The Soviet Union, Turkey, \nand Japan are well-known examples.\nThe problem of dictatorship is likewise posed by decolonializa- \ntion. Either one succeeds in organizing the country and in estab­\nlishing a centralized authoritarian state (as has occurred in \nGhana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Sudan) or anarchy reigns (as in the \nBelgian Congo, CameroonJ. Halfway liberal successes (as, for \nexample, Tunisia) are infinitely rare and fragile.\nAs to economics, it seems scarcely necessary to discuss these \nproblems. All the traditional economic structures of production and \ndistribution in Africa and Asia are exploding in the presence of the \nnew technical means. Up to the time of Western intervention, life \non the Asiatic continent was highly stable; populations and envi­\nronments were in equilibrium. O f course, things were far from be­\ning perfect; undernourishment, for example, was always a danger. \nBut certain civilizations were harmonious enough; some of them\n\f\nTH E CHARACTEROLOCT O F TECHNIQUE1 * 4 )\nendured much longer than our own. Everyone, I believe, agrees \nthat the tribulations of modem Asia stem in part from the com­\nplexity that the West has imposed on it, the complexity and density \nof structure provoked by the indispensable application of tech­\nniques.\nIn all areas, then, technique is producing the rapid collapse of \nall other civilizations. When we speak of the collapse of these civili­\nzations, we are speaking only of sociological forms. Even the weak­\nest civilizations preserve certain values which, in Roger Bastide’s \nwords, permit them to \"maintain a mental equilibrium which cul­\ntural shock might shatter. . . . The social situation allows the old \ncomplexes to remain alive which, not being fulfilled any longer \nthrough ancestral customs, create for themselves new defense \nmechanisms.\" But it is very probable that this situation is only \ntemporary; even these psychological- reserves will be attacked and \nabsorbed by technique when the so-called human techniques \n(those which have man for their object) are applied to them.\nObviously, the effect of technique on these groups will not he \nthe same everywhere. Detailed sociological studies have been \nmade of the various phenomena of assimilation, regrouping, func­\ntioning, and marasmus or progressive dissolution. According to \nthese studies, there has not been comparable and identical pro­\ngression in every case. However, behind this diversity is to be \nnoted an absolute incompatibility between the technical type of \ncivilization and all the others. Technicians have not willed this \noutcome; no one seeks consciously to destroy a civilization. This \nis simply the proverbial collision between the earthenware pot and \nthe iron pot. What happens, happens, despite the best possible \nintentions of the iron pot.\nIt might be said: \"This is not necessary. Why should the simple \nfact of bringing more well-being to India ruin the Hindu civiliza­\ntion?” I do not know if it is necessary, but nevertheless it is so. A \ncivilization which is collapsing cannot be re-created abstractly. \nIt is too late to turn back and enable these worlds to live. What \nhas been given them is not simply well-being. This well-being pre­\nsupposes a transformation of all of life: work where there had been \nonly laziness; machines and their accessories, organs of co-ordina­\ntion and rational administration, and internal adherence to the \nregime."

It can be truly \nefficient and scientific only if it absorbs an enormous number of \nphenomena and brings into play the maximum of data. In order to \nco-ordinate and exploit synthetically, technique must be brought to \nbear on the great masses in every area. But the existence of tech­\nnique in every area leads to monopoly. This is noted by Jacques \nDriencourt when he declares that the technique of propaganda is \ntotalitarian by its very nature. It is totalitarian in message, meth­\nods, field of action, and means. What more could be required?\nOne could require more. Totalitarianism extends to whatevei \ntouches it, even things which seem, at first sight, very remote from \nit. When technique has fastened upon a method, everything must \nbe subordinated to it. There are no longer any neutral objects or \nsituations. Claude Munson forcefully demonstrates that psychologi­\ncal technique, as it operates in the army or in a great industrial \nplant, entails a direct action on the family. It involves psycholog­\nical adaptation of family life to military or industrial methods, \nsupervision of family life, and training family life for military or \nindustrial service. Technique can leave nothing untouched in a \ncivilization. Everything is its concern.\nIt will be objected: \"If these transformations do take place, tech­\nnique alone is not responsible. Many other factors have contrib­\nuted; for example, the intellectual superiority of the white race, the \ncorruption of these other civilizations, and the population growth.”  \nIn fact, all these factors refer back to the problems of techniques. \nIndeed, Western intellectual superiority is only manifested in the \ntechnical domain. And the alleged corruption of the Chinese and \nIslamic civilizations depends solely on the criteria by which they \nare judged. In making the objection, we are in effect judging solely \non the basis of technical criteria.\nAgain, it will be objected: “Granting all this, is it not the case \nthat coexistence, and even synthesis, has been possible between \nthese two kinds of life? After all, when the Barbarians invaded the \nRoman Empire, a successful synthesis eventually took place.” But \nthe historical situation was clearly not the same then as it is to­\nday. In fact, it was the Roman civilization which, being technical, \nendured. The civilizations threatened today by our own can offer \nno effective resistance because they are nontechnical.\nThe decisive factor which leads me to reject the three objections"

    "raw_text": "THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE1 *6  )\njust stated is that our technique, which is destroying aO other civili­\nzations, is more than a simple mechanism: it is a whole civilization \nin itself.\nWe have analyzed the combination of circumstances that \nfavored technical development in the West and guaranteed its \neasy diffusion. Since technique has engulfed civilization, a very \nremarkable effect has been observed— in fact, a complete reversal. \nWhen technique penetrates a new milieu, it tends to reproduce in \nthis milieu the circumstances which, in a fortuitous way, it found \nfavorable to itself in the nineteenth century in France and Eng­\nland. At least, it reproduces those features which it is possible and \nnecessary to reproduce. It is of small importance for technique to \nhit upon a long cultural experience or a favorable demographic \nsituation. On the contrary, social plasticity and a clear technical \nconsciousness are the general terms which it forcibly imposes in \nevery area of the world. It dissociates the sociological forms, des­\ntroys the moral framework, desacralizes men and things, explodes \nsocial and religious taboos, and reduces the body social to a collec­\ntion of individuals. The most recent sociological studies (even \nthose made by optimists) hold that technique is the destroyer of \nsocial groups, of communities (whatever their kind), and of \nhuman relations. Technical progress causes the disappearance, as \nJerome Scott and R. P. Lynton put it, of that “amalgam of attitudes, \ncustoms and social institutions which constitute a community.” \nCommunities break up into their component parts But no new \ncommunities form. The individual in contact with technique loses \nhis social and community sense as the frameworks in which he op­\nerated disintegrate under the influence of techniques. This fact is \nestablished beyond question by the disappearance hf responsibili­\nties, functional autonomies, and social spontaneities, the absence of \ncontact between the technical and the human environment, and so \nforth. In the area of industrial labor, for example, sociologists point \nout the physical separation between the industrial plant and the \nsocial group in which the plant is situated (the city, say). In tra­\nditional societies, the social and the economic aspects of life were \ninextricably meshed into a social whole. But in a technical society \nthe two aspects are strictly separated; this in itself brings about \nthe dissolution of the entire group. Related activities such as pro­\nduction and social relations cannot be separated without ruining\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 127\nthe whole society. However, to the degree that production is tech­\nnique and social relations is not, the two are of necessity dissociated. \nThis is the conclusion reached by innumerable detailed studies of \nsocial groups at the point at which technique begins to function. \nThe conclusion is equally true of the industrialized milieus of Eu­\nrope, America, Asia, and Africa. The situation cannot be otherwise. \nThe technicians themselves are very clear on this point. For exam­\nple, an official report of 1958 on the perspectives of economic devel­\nopment in Algeria indicated that this development can only be \nbrought about by changing the Algerians’ whole way of life, in \nparticular, by putting the still seminomad masses to work. Develop­\nment involves economic planning, displacement of populations, \nmobilization of the local economy, acceptance of authoritarian po­\nlitical power, modification of local moral habits and traditional \nmentalities; in short, a New Deal of the Emotions! These are the \nconditions proposed and (and considered normal) for technical \nprogress in the ’Third World.”*  Technique makes its sociological \ncompost pile where it does not find one already made. And it pos­\nsesses sufficient power and efficiency today to succeed. Before long, \nit will produce everywhere that clear technical consciousness which \nis the easiest of its creations to bring about, and which man falls in \nwith so willingly. The world that technique creates cannot be any \nother than that which was favorable to it from the very beginning. \nIn spite of all the men of good will, all the optimists, all the doers \nof history, the civilizations of the world are being ringed about \nwith a band of steel. We in the West became familiar with this \niron constraint in the nineteenth century. Now technique is me­\nchanically reproducing it everywhere as necessary to its existence. \nWhat force could prevent technique from so acting, or make it be \notherwise than it is?\nTechnique has progressively mastered all the elements of civiliza­\ntion. We have already pointed this out with regard to man’s eco­\nnomic and intellectual activities. But man himself is overpowered \nby technique and becomes its object. The technique which takes \nman for its object thus becomes the center of society; this extraordi­\nnary event (which seems to surprise no one) is often designated \nas technical civilization. The terminology is exact and we must fully\n* Sauvy, Balaodier, et at.: Le Tiers Monde.\n\f\n1x8) th e ch aracteh olocy o f tech n iq ue\ngrasp its importance. Technical civilization means that our civili­\nzation is constructed by technique ( makes a part of civilization only \nwhat belongs to technique), for technique (in that everything in \nthis civilization must serve a technical end), and is exclusively \ntechnique (in that it excludes whatever is not technique or reduces \nit to technical form).\nW e can see that this is actually the case in certain phenomena \nconsidered essential to a civilization, for example, art and litera­\nture. These activities in modern society are tightly subordinated \nin different ways to technical necessities by the direct interference of \ntechnique. Take, for example, the motion pictures, radio, and tele­\nvision. These media require great capital investments. As a result, \nartistic expression is subordinated to a censorship of money or of \nthe state. This censorship most often takes the form of indirect in­\nfluences, which, again, may assume different guises. Personal music \nis supplanted by the radio; and painting, threatened by photogra­\nphy, is obliged to modify itself by becoming abstract so as not to \nbe a mere substitute for reproduction. Modern art and literature \nmanifest in all points their subordination to the technique which \nhas extended its power over all activity, and hence over all culture.\nHerein lies the inversion we are witnessing. Without exception in \ndie course of history, technique belonged to a civilization and was \nmerely a single element among a host of nontechnical activities. \nToday technique has taken over the whole of civilization. Certainly, \ntechnique is no longer the simple machine substitute for human la­\nbor. It has come to be the “intervention into the very substance \nnot only of the inorganic but also of the organic.”\nThis intervention into the inorganic world is represented, for ex­\nample, by the exploration of the atom and its use for purposes as \nyet unknown. But the world which is most clearly taking on a tech­\nnical form is the organic. In this realm the necessity of production \npenetrates to the very sources of life. It controls procreation, influ­\nences growth, and alters the individual and the species. Death, \nprocreation, birth, habitat; all must submit to technical efficiency \nand systematization, the end point of the industrial assembly line. \nWhat seems to be most personal in the life of man is now techni- \ncized. The manner in which he rests and relaxes becomes the object \nof techniques of relaxation. The way in which he makes a deci­\nsion is no longer the domain of the personal and voluntary; it has\n\f\nThe Technological Society (**9\nbecome the object of the techniques of \"operations research.” As \nGiedion says, all this represents experimentation at the very roots \nof being.\nHow is it possible, then, not to believe that all of civilization is \naffected and engulfed when the very substance of man is ques­\ntioned? The essence of civilization is thus absorbed.\nConcerning art, Giedion goes on to say: “What happened to art \nin this period gives us the most intimate vision possible of the pene­\ntration in depth of the human being by mechanization. Barr’s re­\nvealing selections in his Cubism and Abstract Art show us how the \nartist, who reacts like a seismograph, expresses the influence of full \nmechanization . . . Mechanization has penetrated into the sub­\nconscious of the artist. Chirico expresses it in a remarkable way in \nthe mixture he makes of man and machine . . . The anxiety, the \nsolitude of man forms a melancholy architecture of the preced­\ning epoch and its mechanical dolls, painted in the smallest details \nwith a tragic expression.”\nWe have the large-scale frescoes of L6ger which construct the \nimage of cities out of signs, traffic signals, and machine parts. Even \nthe Russians and Hungarians, who in 1920 were far from mechani­\nzation, were inspired by his creative power. In the hands of Du- \nchanu and others, the machine, marvel of efficiency, was trans­\nformed into an irrational object, charged with irony. At the same \ntime, a new aesthetic language was introduced.\nTo free themselves from a corrupt art and the prevailing taste, \nartists have recourse to objects such as machines and mechanisms \nbecause these objects contain an objective truth. What is true of \nthe plastic arts is likewise true of music. Preoccupation with “ob­\njectivity” is prevalent there, too. Igor Stravinsky writes: “My work \nis architectonic and not anecdotal; objective construction and not \ndescriptive.” These are the words of a man unconsciously steeped \nin the technical milieu. Since Stravinsky wrote this, music has been \nstill further transformed by means of techniques which were not \noriginally musical techniques, that is, neither musical methodology \nnor instrument construction. I have in mind Schaeffer’s “concrete \nmusic,” Ussachewsky’s “music for tape,” and Eimert’s electronic \nmusic, all of which make use of technical means that are not a \npriori musical. In none of these types of music is there any longer \nthe need for a performer. The ancestral musical structures disin-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE1 3 0 )\ntegrate and are atomized and we have a phenomenon that is funda­\nmentally new. We shall doubtless see ever more refined and ex­\nacting research into musical technique, and the dominant \nmusical structure and rhythm will undoubtedly correspond en­\ntirely to the technical environment.\nThe external structures imposed by technique can no longer, by \nthemselves, modify the components of a society; here the internal \ninfluence of technique on the human being becomes decisive. \nHenceforth, every component of civilization is subject to the law \nthat technique is itself civilization. Civilization no longer exists of \nitself. Every activity— intellectual, artistic, moral— is only a part of \ntechnique. This fact is so enormous and unpredictable that we \nare simply unable to foresee its consequences. Most of us, blinded \nby traditional and well-established situations, are unable to grasp \nits meaning. Henceforth, there will be no conflict between contend­\ning forces among which technique is only one. The victory of tech­\nnique has already been secured. It is too late to set limits to it \nor to put it in doubt. The fatal flaw in all systems designed to \ncounterbalance the power of technique is that they come too late.\nUnder these circumstances, it is understandable that technique, \nin all the lands it has penetrated, has exploded the local, national \ncultures. Two cultures, of which technique is one, cannot coexist. \nThis does not mean, of course, that uniformity prevails. There are \nstill great differences from region to region. But for the most part \nthese differences are due to the fact that the vestiges of a civiliza­\ntion lake a long time to disappear completely. Technique has al­\nready gained its victory over Buddhism. It is clear, however, that it \nwill take two or three generations to modify the mode of life and \nthought engendered by Buddhism. A certain diversity will per­\nsist while this inode of life is weakening. Technique does not lead \nto general uniformity. In fact, it creates a certain diversity. Its ob­\njectives are always the same, and so is its influence on man. But \nthough it is axiomatic that the one best way will prevail, this one \nbest way will vary with climate, country, and population. The more \ntechnique is refined, the more it varies its means of action. There­\nfore, we shall continue to have the appearance of different civili­\nzations in India and in Greenland. They will indeed be different in \ncertain aspects. But their essence will be identical; they will be \ntechniques. And what differences there are will result from the cold\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 3 1\ncalculation of some technician, instead of being the result of the \nprofound spiritual and material effort of generations of human be­\nings. Instead of being the expression of man’s essence, they will be \nthe accidents of what is essential: technique.\nThe differences which exist today are therefore without impor­\ntance in relation to the fact of technical identity. The differences \nto come will bear upon the most diverse activities and give the \nillusion of liberty. But they will nevertheless be no more than the \nexpression of the monism of technique. Geographically and quali­\ntatively, technique is universal in its manifestations. It is devoted, \nby nature and necessity, to the universal. It could not be otherwise. \nIt depends upon a science itself devoted to the universal, and it is \nbecoming the universal language understood by all men. We need \nnot belabor the fact, which everyone recognizes, that science is uni­\nversal. And this fact in turn leads of necessity to the technical uni- \nversalism which stems from it.\nThe second of the two elements we referred to (production and \nsocial relations) requires more explication. In his relation to the \nworld, man has always made use of multiple means, none of which \nwere universal because none were objective. Technique is a means \nof apprehending reality, of acting on the world, which allows us to \nneglect all individual differences, all subjectivity. Technique alone \nis rigorously objective. It blots out all personal opinions. It effaces \nall individual, and even all collective, modes of expression. Today \nman lives by virtue of his participation in a truth become objective. \nTechnique is no more than a neutral bridge between reality and \nthe abstract man.\nTechnique, moreover, creates a bond between men. All those \nwho follow the same technique are bound together in a tacit \nfraternity and all of them take the same attitude toward reality. \nThere is no need for them to converse together or to understand \none another. A  team of surgeons and assistants who know the tech­\nnique of a given operation have no need to address one another in \norder that the necessary motions be correctly performed at the right \nmoment.\nIndustrial labor likewise tends more and more to dispense with \norders and personal contact. This was pushed to an extreme in the \nconcentration camps, where men of different nations were mixed \ntogether so that they should have no contacts and yet be able to\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROU OF TECHNIQUB\nperform collective work. It was hasty and superficial work, to be \nsure, but a little more rigor could easily make this labor really pro­\nductive (as seems to be the case in the Soviet Union). One cannot \nspeak merely of isolation. These men work in teams, but there is \nno need for them to know or understand one another. They need \nonly understand the technique involved and know in advance what \ntheir teammate will do. It is not necessary for the crew to under­\nstand one another in order to run an aircraft The indicator panel \ncontrols the actions to be performed; and every crew member, sub­\nmitting by necessity and conscience to the automatic indications, \nobeys for the safety of all. Each man’s actions are dictated by the \nconditions of life and its preservation. This is clear in the case of \nflying an aircraft But it is equally clear in every other situation in­\nvolving technique— and this encompasses the most important areas \nof life. Men do not need to understand each other in order to cany \nout the most important endeavors of our times.\nTechnique is of necessity, and as compensation, our universal \nlanguage. It is the fruit of specialization. But this very specializa­\ntion prevents mutual understanding. Everyone today has his own \nprofessional jargon, modes of thought, and peculiar perception of \nthe world. There was a time when the distortion of overspecializa­\ntion was the butt of jokes and a subject for vaudeville. Today the \nsharp knife of specialization has passed like a razor into the living \nflesh. It has cut the umbilical cord which linked men with each \nother and with nature. The man of today is no longer able to under­\nstand his neighbor because his profession is his whole life, and the \ntechnical specialization of this life has forced him to live in a closed \nuniverse. He no longer understands the vocabulary of the others. \nNor does he comprehend the underlying motivations of the others. \nYet technique, having ruptured the relalions between man and \nman, proceeds to rebuild the bridge which links them. It bridges \nthe specializations because it produces a new type of man always \nand everywhere like his duplicate, who develops along technical \nlines. He listens to himself and speaks to himself, but he obeys \nthe slightest indications of the apparatus, confident that his neigh­\nbor will do the same. Technique has become the bond between \nmen. By its agency they communicate, whatever their languages, \nbeliefs, or race. It has become, for life or death, the universal lan­\nguage which compensates for all the deficiencies and separations it\n\f\nThe Technological Society (13 3\nhas itsel{ produced. This is the major reason for the great impetus \nof technique toward the universal.\nThe Autonomy of Technique. The primary aspect of autonomy is \nperfectly expressed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, a leading tech­\nnician. He takes, as his point of departure, the view that the in­\ndustrial plant is a whole in itself, a 'closed organism,” an end in \nitself. Ciedion adds: “What is fabricated in this plant and what is \nthe goal of its labor— these are questions outside its design.” The \ncomplete separation of the goal from the mechanism, the limita­\ntion of the problem to the means, and the refusal to interfere in \nany way with efficiency; all this is clearly expressed b y  Taylor and \nlies at the basis of technical autonomy.\nAutonomy is the essential condition for the development of tech­\nnique, as Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt’s study of the police clearly \nindicates. The police must be independent if they are to become ef­\nficient. They must form a closed, autonomous organization in or­\nder to operate by the most direct and efficient means and not be \nshackled by subsidiary considerations. And in this autonomy, they \nmust be self-confident in respect to the law. It matters little whether \npolice action is legal, if it is efficient. The rules obeyed by a techni­\ncal organization are no longer rules of justice or injustice. They are \n“laws” in a purely technical sense. As far as the police are con­\ncerned, the highest stage is reached when the legislature legalizes \ntheir independence of the legislature itself and recognizes the pri­\nmacy of technical laws. This is the opinion of Best, a leading Ger­\nman specialist in police matters.\nThe autonomy of technique must be examined in different per­\nspectives on the basis of the different spheres in relation to which \nit has this characteristic. First, technique is autonomous with re­\nspect to economics and politics. We have already seen that, at the \npresent, neither economic nor political evolution conditions tech­\nnical progress. Its progress is likewise independent of the social \nsituation. The converse is actually the case, a point I shall develop \nat length. Technique elicits and conditions social, political, and eco­\nnomic change. It is the prime mover of all the rest, in spite of any \nappearance to the contrary and in spite of human pride, which pre­\ntends that man’s philosophical theories are still determining influ­\nences and man’s political regimes decisive factors in technical \nevolution. External necessities no longer determine technique."

    "raw_text": "TOE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE134)\nTechnique’s own internal necessities are determinative. Technique \nhas become a reality in itself, self-sufficient, with its special laws \nand its own determinations.\nLet us not deceive ourselves on this point. Suppose that the \nstate, for example, intervenes in a technical domain. Either it inter­\nvenes for sentimental, theoretical, or intellectual reasons, and the \neffect of its intervention will be negative or nil; or it intervenes for \nreasons of political technique, and we have the combined effect of \ntwo techniques. There is no other possiblity. The historical experi­\nence of the last years shows this fully.\nTo go one step further, technical autonomy is apparent in respect \nto morality and spiritual values. Technique tolerates no judgment \nfrom without and accepts no limitation. It is by virtue of technique \nrather than science that the great principle has become established: \nchacun chez soi. Morality judges moral problems; as far as techni­\ncal problems are concerned, it has nothing to say. Only technical \ncriteria are relevant. Technique, in sitting in judgment on itself, is \nclearly freed from this principal obstacle to human action. \n(Whether the obstacle is valid is not the question here. For the \n.moment we merely record that it is an obstacle.) Thus, technique \ntheoretically and systematically assures to itself that liberty which \nit has been able to win practically. Since it has put itself beyond \ngood and evil, it need fear no limitation whatever. It was long \nclaimed that technique was neutral. Today this is no longer a use­\nful distinction. The power and autonomy of technique are so well \nsecured that it, in its turn, has become the judge of what is moral, \nthe creator of a new morality. Thus, it plays the role of creator of a \nnew civilization as well. This morality— internal to technique— is \nassured of not having to suffer from technique. In any case, in re­\nspect to traditional morality, technique affirms itself as an inde­\npendent power. Man alone is subject, it would seem, to moral judg­\nment. We no longer live in that primitive epoch in which things \nwere good or bad in themselves. Technique in itself is neither, and \ncan therefore do what it will. It is truly autonomous.\nHowever, technique cannot assert its autonomy in respect to \nphysical or biological laws. Instead, it puts them to work; it seeks \nto dominate them.\nGiedion, in his probing study of mechanization and the manu­\nfacture of bread, shows that “wherever mechanization encounters\n\f\nThe Technological Society (13 5\na living substance, bacterial or animal, the organic substance deter­\nmines the laws.” For this reason, the mechanization of bakeries was \na failure. More subdivisions, intervals, and precautions of various \nkinds were required in the mechanized bakery than in the non- \nmechanized bakery. The size of the machines did not save time; \nit merely gave work to larger numbers of people. Giedion shows \nhow the attempt was made to change the nature of the bread in \norder to adapt it to mechanical manipulations. In the last resort, \nthe ultimate success of mechanization turned on the transformation \nof human taste. Whenever technique collides with a natural obsta­\ncle, it tends to get around it either by replacing the living organism \nby a machine, or by modifying the organism so that it no longer \npresents any specifically organic reaction.\nThe same phenomenon is evident in yet another area in which \ntechnical autonomy asserts itself: the relations between techniques \nand man. We have already seen, in connection with technical self­\naugmentation, that technique pursues its own course more and \nmore independently of man. This means that man participates less \nand less actively in technical creation, which, by the automatic \ncombination of prior elements, becomes a kind of fate Man is re­\nduced to the level of a catalyst. Better still, he resembles a slug in­\nserted into a slot machine: he starts the operation without partici­\npating in it\nBut this autonomy with respect to man goes much further. To the \ndegree that technique must attain its result with mathematical pre­\ncision, it has for its object the elimination of all human variability \nand elasticity. It is a commonplace to say that the machine replaces \nthe human being. But it replaces him to a greater degree than has \nbeen believed.\nIndustrial technique will soon succeed in completely replacing \nthe effort of the worker, and it would do so even sooner if capital­\nism were not an obstacle. The worker, no longer needed to guide or \nmove the machine to action, will be required merely to watch it \nand to repair it when it breaks down. He will not participate in the \nwork any more than a boxer’s manager participates in a prize fight. \nThis is no dream. The automated factory has already been realized \nfor a great number of operations, and it is realizable for a far greater \nnumber. Examples multiply from day to day in all areas. Man indi­\ncates how this automation and its attendant exclusion of men op-"

The machine itself interprets the data, the ele­\nmentary bits of information fed into it. It arranges them in texts \nand distinct numbers. It adds them together and classifies the re­\nsults in groups and subgroups, and so on. We have here an ad­\nministrative circuit accomplished by a single, self-controlled ma­\nchine. It is scarcely necessary to dwell on the astounding growth of \nautomation in the last ten years. The multiple applications of the \nautomatic assembly line, of automatic control of production opera­\ntions (so-called cybernetics) are well known. Another case in point \nis the automatic pilot. Until recently the automatic pilot was used \nonly in rectilinear flight; the finer operations were carried out by \nthe living pilot.

Is the elimination of man so unavoidably necessary? \nCertainly! Freeing man from toil is in itself an ideal. Beyond \nthis, every intervention of man, however educated or used to ma­\nchinery he may be, is a source of error and unpredictability. The \ncombination of man and technique is a happy one only if man has \nno responsibility. Otherwise, he is ceaselessly tempted to make un­\npredictable choices and is susceptible to emotional motivations \nwhich invalidate the mathematical precision of the machinery. He \nis also susceptible to fatigue and discouragement. All this disturbs \nthe forward thrust of technique.\nMan must have nothing decisive to perform in the course of \ntechnical operations; after all, he is the source of error. Political \ntechnique is still troubled by certain unpredictable phenomena, in \nspite of all the precision of the apparatus and the skill of those in­\nvolved. (But this technique is still in its childhood.) In human re­\nactions, howsoever well calculated they may be; a “coefficient of \nelasticity' causes imprecision, and imprecision is intolerable to \ntechnique.

And before long— what \nwith the electronic brain— they will attain an intellectual power of \nwhich man is incapable.\nThus, the “great changing of the guard” is occurring much \nmore extensively than Jacques Duboin envisaged some decades \nago. Gaston Bouthoul, a leading sociologist of the phenomena of \nwar, concludes that war breaks out in a social group when there \nis a “plethora of young men surpassing the indispensable tasks of \nthe economy.” When for one reason or another these men are not \nemployed, they become ready for war. It is the multiplication of \nmen who are excluded from working which provokes war. W e \nought at least to bear this in mind when we boast of the continual \ndecrease in human participation in technical operations.\nHowever, there are spheres in which it is impossible to eliminate \nhuman influence. The autonomy of technique then develops in an­\nother direction. Technique is not, for example, autonomous in re­\nspect to clock time. Machines, like abstract technical laws, are \nsubject to the law of speed, and co-ordination presupposes time \nadjustment. In his description of the assembly line, Giedion writes: \n“Extremely precise time tables guide the automatic cooperation of \nthe instruments, which, like the atoms in a planetary system, consist \nof separate units but gravitate with respect to each other in obedi­\nence to their inherent laws.” This image shows in a remarkable way \nhow technique became simultaneously independent of man and \nobedient to the chronometer. Technique obeys its own specific \nlaws, as every machine obeys laws. Each element of the technical \ncomplex follows certain laws determined by its relations with the \nother elements, and these laws are internal to the system and in no \nway influenced by external factors. It is not a question of causing \nthe human being to disappear, but of making him capitulate, of in-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE\nduring him to accommodate himself to techniques and not to ex­\nperience personal feelings and reactions.\nNo technique is possible when men are free. When technique \nenters into the realm of social life, it collides ceaselessly with the \nhuman being to the degree that the combination of man and tech­\nnique is unavoidable, and that technical action necessarily results \nin a determined result. Technique requires predictability and, \nno less, exactness of prediction. It is necessary, then, that technique \nprevail over the human being. For technique, this is a matter of life \nor death. Technique must reduce man to a technical animal, the \nking of the slaves of technique. Human caprice crumbles before \nthis necessity; there can be no human autonomy in the face of tech­\nnical autonomy. The individual must be fashioned by techniques, \neither negatively (by the techniques of understanding man) or \npositively (by the adaptation of man to the technical framework), \nin order to wipe out the blots his personal determination introduces \ninto the perfect design of the organization.\nBut it is requisite that man have certain precise inner charac­\nteristics. An extreme example is the atomic worker or the jet pilot. \nHe must be of calm temperament, and even temper, he must be \nphlegmatic, he must not have too much initiative, and he must be \ndevoid of egotism. The ideal jet pilot is already along in years \n(perhaps thirty-five) and has a settled direction in life. He flies \nhis jet in the way a good civil servant goes to his office. Human \njoys and sorrows are fetters on technical aptitude. Jungk cites the \ncase of a test pilot who had to abandon his profession because \n\"his wife behaved in such a way as to lessen his capacity to fly. \nEvery day, when he returned home, he found her shedding tears of \njoy. Having become in this way accident conscious, he dreaded \ncatastrophe when he had to face a delicate situation.\" The individ­\nual who is a servant of technique must be completely unconscious \nof himself. Without this quality, his reflexes and his inclinations are \nnot properly adapted to technique.\nMoreover, the physiological condition of the individual must an­\nswer to technical demands. Jungk gives an impressive picture of \nthe experiments in training and control that jet pilots have to \nundergo. The pilot is whilred on centrifuges until he “blacks out” \n(in order to measure his toleration of acceleration). There are cata­\npults, ultrasonic chambers, etc., in which the candidate is forced\n\f\nThe Technological Society (139\nto undergo unheard-of tortures in order to determine whether he \nhas adequate resistance and whether he is capable of piloting the \nnew machines. That the human organism is, technically speaking, \nan imperfect one is demonstrated by the experiments. The suffer­\nings the individual endures in these “laboratories” are considered \nto be due to “biological weaknesses,” which must be eliminated. \nNew experiments have pushed even further to determine the re­\nactions of “space pilots” and to prepare these heroes for their roles \nof tomorrow. This has given birth to new sciences, biometry for \nexample; their one aim is to create the new man, the man adapted \nto technical functions.\nIt will be objected that these examples are extreme. This is cer­\ntainly the case, but to a greater or lesser degree the same prob­\nlem exists everywhere. And the more technique evolves, the more \nextreme its character becomes. The object of all the modem “hu­\nman sciences” (which I will examine later on) is to find answers \nto these problems.\nThe enormous effort required to put this technical civilization \ninto motion supposes that all individual effort is directed toward \nthis goal alone and that all social forces are mobilized to attain the \nmathematically perfect structure of the edifice. (“Mathematically” \ndoes not mean “rigidly.” The perfect technique is the most adapta­\nble and, consequently, the most plastic one. True technique will \nknow how to maintain the illusion of liberty, choice, and individ­\nuality; but these will have been carefully calculated so that they \nwill be integrated into the mathematical reality merely as appear­\nances!) Henceforth it will be wrong for a man to escape this \nuniversal effort. It will be inadmissible for any part of the individ­\nual not to be integrated in the drive toward technicization; it will be \ninadmissible that any man even aspire to escape this necessity of \nthe whole society. The individual will no longer be able, materially \nor spiritually, to disengage himself from society. Materially, he will \nnot be able to release himself because the technical means are so \nnumerous that they invade his whole life and make it impossible \nfor him to escape the collective phenomena. There is no longer an \nuninhabited place, or any other geographical locale, for the \nwould-be solitary. It is no longer possible to refuse entrance into \na community to a highway, a high-tension line, or a dam. It is vain \nto aspire to live alone when one is obliged to participate in all col-\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCT OF TECHNIQUE140)\nlective phenomena and to use all the collective’s tools, without \nwhich it is impossible to earn a bare subsistence. Nothing is gratis \nany longer in our society; and to live on charity is less and less \npossible. ‘‘Social advantages” are for the workers alone, not for “use­\nless mouths.” The solitary is a useless mouth and will have no ration \ncard— up to the day he is transported to a penal colony. (An at­\ntempt was made to institute this procedure during the French Rev­\nolution, with deportations to Cayenne.)\nSpiritually, it will be impossible for the individual to disassociate \nhimself from society. This is due not to the existence of spiritual \ntechniques which have increasing force in our society, but rather to \nour situation. We are constrained to be “engaged,” as the existen­\ntialists say, with technique. Positively or negatively, our spiritual \nattitude is constantly urged, if not determined, by this situation. \nOnly bestiality, because it is unconscious, would seem to escape \nthis situation, and it is itself only a product of the machine.\nEvery conscious being today is walking the narrow ridge of a \ndecision with regard to technique. He who maintains that he can \nescape it is either a hypocrite or unconscious. The autonomy of \ntechnique forbids the man of today to choose his destiny. Doubt­\nless, someone will ask if it has not always been the case that social \nconditions, environment, manorial oppression, and the family con­\nditioned man’s fate. The answer is, of course, yes. But there is no \ncommon denominator between the suppression of ration cards in \nan authoritarian state and the family pressure of two centuries ago. \nIn the past, when an individual entered into conflict with society, \nhe led a harsh and miserable life that required a vigor which ei­\nther hardened or broke him. Today the concentration camp and \ndeath await him; technique cannot tolerate aberrant activities.\nBecause of the autonomy of technique, modern man cannot \nchoose his means any more than his ends. In spite of variability and \nflexibility according to place and circumstance (which are charac­\nteristic of technique) there is still only a single employable tech­\nnique in the given place and time in which an individual is situ­\nated. We have already examined the reasons for this.\nAt this point, we must consider the major consequences of the \nautonomy of technique. This will bring us to the climax of this \nanalysis.\nTechnical autonomy explains the “specific weight” with which\n\f\nThe Techndogical Society (141\ntechnique is endowed. It is not a kind of neutral matter, with no \ndirection, quality, or structure. It is a power endowed with its own \npeculiar force. It refracts in its own specific sense the wills which \nmake use of it and the ends porposed for it. Indeed, independently \nof the objectives that man pretends to assign to any given technical \nmeans, that means always conceals in itself a finality which cannot \nbe evaded. And if there is a competition between this intrinsic final­\nity and an extrinsic end proposed by man, it is always the intrinsic \nfinality which carries the day. If the technique in question is not \nexactly adapted to a proposed human end, and if an individual pre­\ntends that he is adapting the technique to this end, it is generally \nquickly evident that it is the end which is being modified, not the \ntechnique. Of course, this statement must be qualified by what has \nalready been said concerning the endless refinement of techniques \nand their adaptation. But this adaptation is effected with reference \nto the techniques concerned and to the conditions of their applica­\nbility. It does not depend on external ends. Perrot has demon­\nstrated this in the case of judicial techniques, and Giedion in the \ncase of mechanical techniques. Concerning the over-all problem of \nthe relation between the ends and the means, I take the liberty \nof referring to my own work, Presence au monde modeme.\nOnce again we are faced with a choice of 'all or nothing.' If \nwe make use of technique, we must accept the specificity and \nautonomy of its ends, and the totality of its rules. Our own desires \nand aspirations can change nothing.\nThe second consequence of technical autonomy is that it renders \ntechnique at once sacrilegious and sacred. (Sacrilegious is not used \nhere in the theological but in the sociological sense.) Sociologists \nhave recognized that the world in which man lives is for him not \nonly a material but also a spiritual world; that forces act in it which \nare unknown and perhaps unknowable; that there are phenomena \nin it which man interprets as magical; that there are relations and \ncorrespondences between things and beings in which material con­\nnections are of little consequence. This whole area is mysterious. \nMystery (but not in the Catholic sense) is an element of man’s life. \nJung has shown that it is catastrophic to make superficially clear \nwhat is hidden in man’s innermost depths. Man must make allow­\nance for a background, a great deep above which lie his reason and \nhis clear consciousness. The mystery of man perhaps creates the\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUEI4 S )\nmystery of the world he inhabits. Or perhaps this mystery is a real­\nity in itself. There is no way to decide between these two alterna­\ntives. But, one way or the other, mystery is a necessity of human \nlife.\nMan cannot live without a sense of the secret The psychoana­\nlysts agree on this point. But the invasion of technique desacralizes \nthe world in which man is called upon to live. For technique noth­\ning is sacred, there is no mystery, no taboo. Autonomy makes this so. \nTechnique does not accept the existence of rules outside itself, or \nof any norm. Still less will it accept any judgment upon it. As a \nconsequence, no matter where it penetrates, what it does is per­\nmitted, lawful, justified.\nTo a great extent, mystery is desired by man. It is not that he \ncannot understand, or enter into, or grasp mystery, but that he does \nnot desire to do so. The sacred is what man decides unconsciously \nto respect. The taboo becomes compelling from a social standpoint, \nbut there is always a factor of adoration and respect which does not \nderive from compulsion and fear.\nTechnique worships nothing, respects nothing. It has a single \nrole: to strip off externals, to bring everything to light, and by ra­\ntional use to transform everything into means. More than science, \nwhich limits itself to explaining the “how,” technique desacralizes \nbecause it demonstrates (by evidence and not by reason, through \nuse and not through books) that mystery does not exist. Science \nbrings to the light of day everything man had believed sacred. \nTechnique takes possession of it and enslaves it. The sacred cannot \nresist. Science penetrates to the great depths of the sea to photo­\ngraph the unknown fish of the deep. Technique captures them, \nhauls them up to see if they are edible— but before they arrive on \ndeck they burst. And why should technique not act thus? It is au­\ntonomous and recognizes as barriers only the temporary limits of its \naction. In its eyes, this terrain, which is for the moment unknown \nbut not mysterious, must be attacked. Far from being restrained by \nany scruples before the sacred, technique constantly assails it. \nEverything which is not yet technique becomes so. It is driven on­\nward by itself, by its character of self-augmentation. Technique \ndenies mystery a priori. The mysterious is merely that which has \nnot yet been technicized.\nTechnique advocates the entire remaking of life and its frame-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (14 3\nwork because they have been badly made. Since heredity is full of \nchance, technique proposes to suppress it so as to engender the kind \nof men necessary for its ideal of service. The creation of the ideal \nman will soon be a simple technical operation. It is no longer neces­\nsary to rely on the chances of the family or on the personal vigor \nwhich is called virtue. Applied biogenetics is an obvious point at \nwhich technique desacralizes;5  but we must not forget psycho­\nanalysis, which holds that dreams, visions, and the psychic life in \ngeneral are nothing more than objects. Nor must we forget the pene­\ntration and exploitation of the earth’s secrets. Crash programs, par­\nticularly in the United States, are attempting to reconstruct the soil \nwhich massive exploitation and the use of chemical fertilizers have \nimpaired. We shall soon discover the functions of chlorophyll and \nthus entirely transform the conditions of life. Recent investigations \nin electronic techniques applied to biology have emphasized the \nimportance of DNA and will possibly result in the discovery of the \nlinkbetween the living and the nonliving.\nNothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the super­\nnatural. The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very \nwell that there is nothing spiritual anywhere. But man cannot live \nwithout the sacred. He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred \nto the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to tech­\nnique itself. In the world in which we live, technique has become \nthe essential mystery, taking widely diverse forms according to \nplace and race. Those who have preserved some of the notions of \nmagic both admire and fear technique. Radio presents an inex­\nplicable mystery, an obvious and recurrent miracle. It is no less \nastonishing than the highest manifestations of magic once were, \nand it is worshipped as an idol would have been worshipped, with \nthe same simplicity and fear.\nBut custom and the recurrence of the miracle eventually wear \nout this primitive adoration. It is scarcely found today in European \ncountries; the proletariat, workers and peasants alike, with their \nmotorcycles, radios, and electrical appliances, have an attitude of \ncondescending pride toward the jinn who is their slave. Their ideal \nis incarnated in certain things which serve them. Yet they retain \nsome feeling of the sacred, in the sense that life is not worth the\n8 See, in this connection, the previous note.\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUEM 4 )\ntrouble of living unless a man has these jinns in his home. This \nattitude goes much further in the case of the conscious segment of \nthe proletariat, among whom technique is seen as a whole and not \nmerely in its occasional aspects. For them, technique is the instru­\nment of liberation for the proletariat. All that is needed is for tech­\nnique to make a little more headway, and they will be freed pro­\nportionately from their chains. Stalin pointed to industrialization \nas the sole condition for the realization of Communism. Every \ngain made by technique is a gain for the proletariat. This represents \nindeed a belief in the sacred. Technique is the god which brings \nsalvation. It is good in its essence. Capitalism is an abomination \nbecause on occasion it opposes technique. Technique is the hope \nof the proletarians; they can have faith in it because its miracles are \nvisible and progressive. A great part of their sense of the mysterious \nremains attached to it. Karl Marx may have been able to explain \nrationally how technique would free the proletariat, but the prole­\ntariat itself is scarcely equal to a full understanding of this “how.” \nIt remains mysterious for them. They retain merely the formula \nof faith. But their faith addresses itself with enthusiasm to the \nmysterious agent of their liberation.\nThe nonintellectual classes of the bourgeoisie are perhaps less \ncaught up in this worship of technique. But the technicians of the \nbourgeoisie are without doubt the ones most powerfully taken with \nit. For them, technique is sacred, since they have no reason to \nfeel a passion for it. Technical men are always disconcerted when \none asks them the motives for their faith. No, they do not expect to \nbe liberated; they expect nothing, yet they sacrifice themselves \nand devote their lives with frenzy to the development of industrial \nplants and the organization of banks. The happiness of the human \nrace and suchlike nonsense are the commonplaces they allege. But \nthese are no longer of any service even as justifications, and they \ncertainly have nothing at all to do with man’s passion for technique.\nThe technician uses technique perhaps because it is his profes­\nsion, but he does so with adoration because for him technique is \nthe locus of the sacred. There is neither reason nor explanation in \nhis attitude. The power of technique, mysterious though scientific, \nwhich covers the whole earth with its networks of waves, wires, \nand paper, is to the technician an abstract idol which gives him a\n\f\nThe Technological Society (145\nreason for living and even for joy. One sign, among many, of the \nfeeling of the sacred that man experiences in the face of technique \nis the care he takes to treat it with familiarity. Laughter and humor \nare common human reactions in the presence of the sacred. This is \ntrue for primitive peoples; and for the same reason the first atomic \nbomb was called “Gilda,\" the giant cyclotron of Los Alamos \n“Clementine,” the atomic piles “water pots,” and radioactive con­\ntamination “scalding.” The technicians of Los Alamos have banned \nthe word atom from their vocabulary. These things are significant.\nIn view of the very different forms of technique, there is no \nquestion of a technical religion. But there is associated with it the \nfeeling of the sacred, which expresses itself in different ways. The \nway differs from man to man, but for all men the feeling of the \nsacred is expressed in this marvelous instrument of the power in­\nstinct which is always joined to mystery and magic. The worker \nbrags about his job because it offers him joyous confirmation of his \nsuperiority. The young snob speeds along at 100 m.p.h. in his \nPorsche. The technician contemplates with satisfaction the gradi­\nents of his charts, no matter what their reference is. For these men, \ntechnique is in every way sacred; it is the common expression of \nhuman power without which they would find themselves poor, \nalone, naked, and stripped of all pretentions. They would no longer \nbe the heroes, geniuses, or archangels which a motor permits them \nto be at little expense.\nWhat shall we say of the outburst of frenzy when the Sputnik \nwent into orbit? What of the poems of the Soviets, the metaphysical \naffirmations of the French, the speculations on the conquest of the \nuniverse? What of the identification of this artificial satellite with \nthe sun, or of its invention with the creation of the earth? And, on \nthe other side of the Atlantic, what was the real meaning of the ex­\ncessive consternation of the Americans? All these bore witness to a  \nmarked social attitude with regard to a simple technical fact.\nEven people put out of work or ruined by technique, even those \nwho criticize or attack it (without daring to go so far as to turn \nworshippers against them) have the bad conscience of all icono­\nclasts. They find neither within nor without themselves a compen­\nsating force for the one they call into question. They do not even \nlive in despair, which would be a sign of their freedom. This bad\n\f\nTHE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE146  )\nconscience appears to me to be perhaps the most revealing fact \nabout the new sacralization of modern technique.\nThe characteristics we have examined permit me to assert with \nconfidence that there is no common denominator between the tech­\nnique of today and that of yesterday. Today we are dealing with an \nutterly different phenomenon. Those who claim to deduce from \nman’s technical situation in past centuries his situation in this one \nshow that they have grasped nothing of the technical phenomenon. \nThese deductions prove that all their reasonings are without \nfoundation and all their analogies are astigmatic.\nThe celebrated formula of Alain has been invalidated: \"Tools, \ninstruments of necessity, instruments that neither lie nor cheat, tools \nwith which necessity can be subjugated by obeying her, without the \nhelp of false laws; tools that make it possible to conquer by obey­\ning.” This formula is true of the tool which puts man squarely in \ncontact with a reality that will bear no excuses, in contact with mat­\nter to be mastered, and the only way to use it is to obey it. Obedi­\nence to the plow and the plane was indeed the only means of domi­\nnating earth and wood. But the formula is not true for our \ntechniques. He who serves these techniques enters another realm \nof necessity. This new necessity is not natural necessity; natural \nnecessity, in fact, no longer exists. It is technique’s necessity, which \nbecomes the more constraining the more nature’s necessity fades \nand disappears. It cannot be escaped or mastered. The tool was \nnot false. But technique causes us to penetrate into the innermost \nrealm of falsehood, showing us all the while the noble face of ob­\njectivity of result. In this innermost recess, man is no longer able to \nrecognize himself because of the instruments he employs.\nThe tool enables man to conquer. But, man, dost thou not know \nthere is no more victory which is thy victory? The victory of our \ndays belongs to the tool. The tool alone has the power and carries \noff the victory. Man bestows on himself the laurel crown, after the \nexample of Napoleon III, who stayed in Paris to plan the strategy \nof the Crimean War and claimed the bay leaves of the victor.\nBut this delusion cannot last much longer. The individual obeys \nand no longer has victory which is his own. He cannot have ac­\ncess even to his apparent triumphs except by becoming himself the \nobject of technique and the offspring of the mating of man and"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER\n0 0\nTECHNIQUE \nAND ECONOMY\nThere is a certain nai'vet6 in wishing to treat the problem of eco­\nnomic technique in a few pages, and it seems completely useless \nto take up once again a question so frequently studied. But, as in \nthe book as a whole, I do not mean to address myself exclusively to \nthose aspects of the problem which are traditionally considered, \nthat is, to the facts. The facts, figures, statistics (well or little \nknown) form the background and foundation of my inquiry. It \nseems unnecessary to reiterate them. They can be found in many \nbooks, so I shall continue with the “cursive” method I have hitherto \nemployed. By encircling the facts, I shall emphasize their impor­\ntance; and on the basis of the data given, I shall seek to derive \nnew aspects and “lines of force” for new studies. It might be asked \nwhether, this has not already been done and is hence unnecesary. \nBut this inquiry presupposes that we have escaped not only from \nsole preoccupation with brute facts but from formal logic as well \nNeither gives an account of reality. The point is to let oneself be \nguided by a kind of logic internal to facts and things. It is useless \nto speak of “laws.” I am opposed to the attitude, represented for ex-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (14 9\nample by the works of Fourasti6, which combines elements on the \nbasis of pure logic, yielding a terribly linear and inhuman result. \nI am likewise opposed to the attitude, characteristic of the majority \nof Western intellectuals, which, having taken account of the facts, \ndenies them forthwith by avowals of hope and assertions of the cer­\ntainty of human freedom— which is anything but scientific. This \nattitude can be reduced to the conviction that the reality of things \nis simply too frightful to behold. Instead of guiding themselves by \nreality, most investigators of the problem adopt an attitude flatly \ncontradicted by all the events of modern times. This attitude might \nbe summarized as follows: “The facts are the elements of a game \nof patience which is amorphous and has no form of its own. The \nindividual is perfectly at liberty among these facts to arrange the \npieces of the game as he will and to elaborate a voluntary and hu­\nmane economy.”\nI take an extreme view but one that I believe is closer to reality. \nI see that the facts have their form and their specific weight. They \nrespect neither freedom of the individual nor formal logic. I am \nstriving in this essay to find their special consistency and their com­\nmon tendencies, and to discover whether man still has a place in \nthis tangle; whether he still has any authority among these colossal \nmasses in movement; whether he still can exert any force whatever \non the statistics which are slipping from his hands into the abstract \nand the unreal. Can he have a place, authority, and the pos­\nsibility of action on. a better basis than ill-founded declarations of \nhope or blind acts of unreasonable faith?\nThe Best and the Worst\nThe Influence of Technique on the Economy. Let us consider first \nthe aspect of the relation between technique and economy which \nis traditionally studied, particularly by Marx. Technique, or rather \ntechniques, appears as the motive force and the foundation of the \neconomy. Without them, there is no economy. For this reason, a \ndistinction can be made in economics between dynamic force, \nwhich is technical invention, and static force, the organization of \nthe economy. Marx distinguishes between the system of production \nand the system of distribution: the former revolutionary, the latter\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY*5°)\nnecessarily conservative. It is self-deception to put economics at the \nbase of the Marxist system. It is technique upon which all the rest \ndepends. But the distinction made by Marx must be revised, for \nit is no longer true that technique plays its role in the realm of pro­\nduction alone. Distribution, too, is to a great degree modified by \ntechniques. Indeed, no area of economic life is today independent \nof technical development. It is to Fourastie’s credit that he pointed \nout that technical development controls all contemporary economic \nevolution, from production operations to demography. (There is no \ndoubt that world population growth is related to the increase in \nconsumption.) Even more abstract spheres are shown by Four- \nastie to be dominated by technical progress; for example, the price \nmechanism, capital evolution, foreign trade, population displace­\nment, unemployment, and so on.\nThis invasion of all economic activity by technique seems today \nindisputable. O f course the problem had been raised by economists \nbefore Fourastie, if not in full, at least to a certain degree. In an ef­\nfort to explain crises, Gottfried Haberler, in Prosperity and De­\npression, ascribed their existence to inequality of technical develop­\nment in different branches of economic activity. The success of a \ntechnique leads to its full development; technique will tend to reach \nthe limits of its possible development in a given area. The result is, \nfirst, an inequality of power in the various areas of the economy, \nwhich provokes an unblancing of the whole system; and second, \na diminution of plasticity of the economic milieu. Technical prog­\nress entails stasis in one part or other of the system; the economy \nis strained to the full and loses all possibility of adaptation, bar­\nring, of course, a complete breakdown. The crisis then results from \nthe fact that the system cannot progress, economically, at the same \ntempo in all its parts.\nHenri Guitton returns to this idea when he notes that the adap­\ntive mechanisms which were active during the nineteenth century \nhave become more and more hampered. This disturbance seems to \nbe attributable to the loss of structural elasticity. A structure suita­\nble to simplified mechanisms, lighter, so to speak (the old world had \nnot accumulated as many innovations as the new), is no longer \nadapted to the exigencies of growth of a world no longer young.\nIn an altogether different field, John Maynard Keynes has also \nshown in his work, General Theory, that technical progress is an\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 5 1\nindispensable factor in the economy. The economic world cannot \nremain stationary. It is unceasingly called on to evolve. In particu­\nlar, the importance of technical progress is central to the theory of \ninvestment. All the possibilities of labor must be utilized at any \nprice. It is necessary constantly to uncover new possibilities of in­\nvestment. For, says Keynes, the more numerous the consumers’ \ngoods— the production of which has been provided for in advance \n— the more difficult it is to find corresponding new needs— which \nmust likewise be anticipated and which call for new investments. \nWhat Keynes in fact fears is that there will not be sufficient new \npossibilities of investment. There is only one way to ensure limit­\nless possibilities. These possibilities have nothing to do with spon­\ntaneous human needs, but involve technical discovery and applica­\ntion, which create new products to replace the old, and also stimu­\nlate the need for these products. Technical progress is therefore a \ndecisive factor in the progression of investment. The epicentric po­\nsition of the theory of investment in Keynes’s system is well known. \nIf a Byzantine phase of technical arrest were to occur in the eco­\nnomic realm, it would represent not only an arrest of economic \nevolution but a regression as well, with a resultant series of deep \ncrises.\nIn a closely related sense, a great importance is attached to tech­\nnique both by those who hold and by those who reject the theory \nof economic maturity. According to this theory, only ceaseless tech­\nnical progress can compensate for the causes of depression which \nbecome manifest in an economy that has arrived at maturity. \nThese causes of depression are decline in the rate of population \ngrowth and limitation of geographic expansion— two factors which \nentail a decrease in the rate of investment. Technical progress could \nremedy this but, according to the initiator of the theory, technique \nshares in the decrease, not absolutely, but relatively. Technical \nprogress no longer occurs rapidly enough to compensate for the \nother factors. Not even the opponents of this theory repudiate the \nimportance of the technical factor, and that is what interests 11s \nhere.\nYet another element of economic life ought not to be neglected: \nagricultural production. In this case, too, the upheaval brought \nabout by techniques is a radical one. We have already noted the \ndanger to the earth itself. As to the benefits and the penetration of\n\f\nis*) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY\ntechnique into farm labor, it suffices to refer the interested reader to \nGiedion s work. But I must insist on one point: as a result of the \ninfluence of techniques, the modern world is faced with a kind of \n“unblocking of peasant life and mentality.\" For a long time peasant \ntradition resisted innovation, and the old agricultural systems pre­\nserved their stability. Today technical transformation is an estab­\nlished fact; the peasant revolution is in process or already com­\npleted, and everywhere in the same direction The actual extent of \nthe progress of this revolution is of small importance; what counts \nis the first step, which permits the barriers of tradition to be hur­\ndled. The peasant becomes conscious of the inferiority of his tradi­\ntions; the usual justifications are held in contempt and the peasant \nworld passes from the irrational to the rational. Once again we en­\ncounter the notion that technique destroys traditional forms of civi­\nlization and introduces instead a global unity. What does this un­\nblocking mean for the future? In the years to come we shall witness \nan acceleration of technical progress in rural life, and an accelera­\ntion of already perceptible phenomena: peasant emigration, agri­\ncultural specialization, deforestation, and the growth of agricultu­\nral production in general. These events are of major importance in \nview of the fact that agricultural production still remains the basis \nof economic life; and that the countries of the world most depend­\nent on industry, Great Britain and Japan, have not reached as high \na standard of living as the United States because of the lack of suf­\nficient cultivable lands. The economic repercussions of this type of \ntechnical progress are easily grasped.\nThese examples, chosen arbitrarily from different social areas, \nshow that the influence of technique on economic life is much more \nwidespread and profound than classical manuals of economics \nwould have us believe.\nMoreover, all this is implied in the elementary observation that \nthe progress of production closely depends on technical progress. \nIt is at the present a truism to say that a new, general economic \norganization corresponds to certain new forms of production.\nThis dependence of the economy on techniques and primarily \non machines has come about in an irrational way. It is not the ac­\ntion of clear and certain causes which have produced this interde­\npendence. Veblen asks whether machines do not squander more\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( i S3\neffort and material than they save; whether they do not cause grave \neconomic losses by the developments they bring about in means of \ntransport, etc. The same questions are put by Bertrand Bussell and \nstill more emphatically by Gaston Bardet, who points to the enor­\nmous waste of human forces, of time, work, and capital, occa­\nsioned by the social structures conditioned by the machine. These \nare indeed simple questions, but important ones.\nWe see, then, that the influence of technique on the economy \ndoes not arise from an indisputable economic superiority of the ma­\nchine. Ideas and theories no longer dominate, but rather the power \nof production. The industrial revolution of the nineteenth century \nresulted immediately from the technical advances of that time; this \nrelation has not changed. Marx was unquestionably right with re­\nspect to the period from about 1830 to the present; the motive force \nof all economic evolution has indeed been technical development. \nHowever, Marx was not necessarily right with respect to other pe­\nriods of history. Technical progress has not always been the basic \nprinciple. We have already shown the contrary. Moreover, this does \nnot mean that the consequences Marx draws from his contention \nare true. All we need do is note that Marx’s observation is correct: \nthe more we advance into the new world, the more is economic life \ndependent on technical development.\nEconomic Consequences. As Jean Marchal says, “the accumula­\ntion of machines transforms the economy.” We know that technique \nis not equivalent to the machine, and Marchal’s statement is even \ntruer when technique is considered in my more general sense. \nFurthermore, his formula, which historically is more or less exact, \ntends to appear all the more exact in view of the economic dis­\nturbances caused, for example, by automation. A simplistic view of \nthe automated economy proclaims ease and abundance for all \nmen, thanks to technique. But, unfortunately, this is not so sim­\nple. We are, in fact, confronted with a phenomenon which will \nproduce a veritable economic mutation. None of the economic \nmodalities (salaries, distribution, reduction of the work week, trans­\nfer of the labor force from one area to another, disturbance of the \nbalance of production in the various areas) seems capable of reso­\nlution in the present state of affairs. Even the socialist economic \nstructure is not adapted to receive the massive effects of automa-\n\f\n1 5 4) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY\ntion. This has been avowed by the Soviet economists themselves in \ntheir research into the effects of automation in the light of Marxism.\nReturning to Marchal’s formula, we might ask in what direction \nthis transformation acts. If we consider certain traits of technical \nprogress of concern to the economy, we note that they all move in \nthe same direction. Let us recall that technical means are becom­\ning more and more enormous and costly. Consider, for example, \n(a) the ever more numerous machines that are necessary to pro­\nduction, which act more rapidly, are always being improved upon, \nand are subject to frequent replacement because of constant inven­\ntive progress; (b) the organization of labor, which implies more \nand more numerous and costly personnel, which, although indis­\npensable, is not always immediately forthcoming; (c) publicity \ntechniques. In all these economic means the same fact is to be \nnoted, the investment of enormous amounts of nonproductive capi­\ntal. Capital in such amounts can no longer be owned by a single per­\nson and economic activity is beyond the range of individual possi­\nbilities. But technical progress cannot do without the concentration \nof capital. An economy based on individual enterprise is not con­\nceivable, barring an extraordinary technical regression. The neces­\nsary concentration of capital thus gives rise either to an economy of \ncorporations or to a state economy.\nA concentration of enterprise corresponds to this concentration \nof capital. This fact can hardly be denied today, especially in view \nof the power of these enterprises. Two examples from the United \nStates: In 1939, 52 per cent of all industrial capital was held by \n0.1 per cent of the total number of enterprises; and in 1944, 62 per \ncent of all workers were employed in 2 per cent of American enter­\nprises. A similar concentration of banking facilities exists. O f 30,000 \nbanks in the United States in 1920, only 15,000 were left in 1956. \nThere were 350 mergers in 1955 alone. The situation became so evi­\ndent that in 1956 the Federal Reserve Board undertook a campaign \nagainst this concentration.\nThis tendency toward concentration is confirmed daily, as Joseph \nLajugie shows. The important thing is to recognize the real motive \nforce behind it. The human and social effects of this concentration \nare, on the whole, evil. In a great corporation, the workers are \nmore than ever enslaved and scarcely in a position to act in a dis­\ntinctively human way. Even the consumer is frequently imposed\n\f\nThe Technological Society (255\nupon. The integration of the individual into the technical complex \nis more complete than ever before.\nFrom the purely economic point of view, the value of the results \nis highly debatable. It would seem, from the point of view of the \nmarket economy, that concentration should be a markedly favora­\nble factor. It involves, for example, suppression of competition and \na tendency to raise prices. But, more striking still, concentration does \nnot result in growth of profits. In many branches of production, \nprofit growth is arrested or even declines when the transition is \nmade from the medium-size enterprise to the large corporation.\nWhat, then, is the motive force behind this concentration? Tech­\nnique alone. A number of elements in technique demand concen­\ntration. Mechanical technique requires it because only a very large \ncorporation is in a position at the present to take advantage of the \nmost recent inventions. Only the large corporation is able to apply \nnormalization, to recover waste products profitably, and to manu­\nfacture byproducts. Technique applied to problems of labor effi­\nciency requires concentration because only through concentration \nis it possible to apply up-to-date methods which have gone far be­\nyond the techniques of the former efficiency and time-study experts \n(for instance, the application of techniques of industrial relations). \nFinally, economic technique demands both vertical and horizontal \nconcentration, which permits stockpiling at more favorable prices, \naccelerated capital turnover, reduction of fixed charges, assurance \nof markets, and so on.\nTechnical progress thus entails concentration. But this concen­\ntration represents real advantages only in the technical domain. The \nimpulse to concentrate is so strong that it takes place even contrary \nto the decisions of the state. In the United States and in France, \nthe state has often opposed concentration, but ultimately it has \nalways been forced to capitulate and to stand by impotently while \nthe undesired development occurs. This confirms my judgment con­\ncerning the decisive action of technique on the modem economy.\nWhat is more, the technique of organization renders the inter­\nvention of the state indispensable.\nThe necessity of normalizing products is no longer debated today. \nIt is one of the conditions of economic progress. This normalization \nis based on technical research. But here, as everywhere else in a \ncapitalist or semiliberal economy, the technical result is in conflict\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY15« )\nwith certain interests. In order to apply it, the good will of the pub­\nlic cannot be counted on. It then becomes indispensable to sanction \nnormalization in some other way. And only the state can apply this \nsanction. The result is the creation of arbitration commissions armed \nwith public powers to deal with normalization.\nTechnical necessity calls for state intervention in order to organ­\nize the electric power network. Later on I shall discuss the inter­\nrelation of the network and the purely technical motives which \nprompt it. It is not the regulation of opposed interests, but the ne­\ncessity of a higher organization embracing the local organizations, \nwhich, in this case, brings about the appeal to state power. The \ntechnical organism called a combine is of the same order. Whether \nit be the TVA or a Soviet Kombinat, it is perfectly illusory to claim \nthat such combines represent autonomous organisms. In fact, the \ntechnical necessity which brought them into being gains force and \nvalue only through state intervention. Doubtless, when the organ­\nism is constituted, it may receive a certain independence from the \nstate. But we must not forget who the real parent is. Nor must we \noverlook the fact that this parentage represents a profound inter­\nvention in the economy on the part of the state, an intervention, \nmoreover, not dictated by a theory or a will to power, but by the \ntechnical manifest.\nThe necessity of utilizing certain goods also tends in the same \ndirection. It has long been recognized that technical progress is \neffected more rapidly in the creation of the means of production. \nFrom this fact comes a kind of hypertrophy of machine-producing \nindustries. The well-known Hoover Committee for the elimination \nof waste found, for example, that the production of the American \nclothing industry was 45 per cent greater than necessary. The ca \npacity ot the shoe industry was double its real production; and the \nprinting industry was overequipped by 100 per cent. The excess \nproduction of home appliances and automobiles is well known. \nNone of this overproduction would represent a waste, if one were \njudging on the basis of world needs. But, in the present situation, \noverproduction produces disequilibrium with respect to revenues, \ninvestment, and consumption possibilities, and so on. There is no \nabsolute need to halt technical growth in any given area (say, in \nheavy industry). But there is a need to find markets for this over­\nproduction. At present, only the state is in a position to sustain the"

I could easily give additional examples; \nfor instance, in the development of financial and banking tech­\nniques. Let us bear in mind that atomic energy, say, when put to \nwork will suppose state control of all sources of energy. It is incon­\nceivable that an individual could have at his disposal the sources \nof atomic power. Not doctrinal but technical reasons today render \neconomic life inseparable from the state. This does not mean that \nthe economy necessarily becomes collectivist or totalitarian. For the \nmoment let us simply note the indissoluble relation.\nThis relation is admitted by many economists. Is it the result \nof chance or of choice? Of neither exclusively. Nor is it the result of \na managed economy. As Robert Moss6 writes: “With the develop­\nment of the managed economy, it has become very difficult to trace \na boundary between politics and economics . . . ” In reality, it is a \nnecessity resulting from the advance of technique. Technique plays \nan important role in economic life; but it has the same effect with \nreference to economic science. A relation is being established be­\ntween technical progress in economic life and technical progress \nin science or method. The two converge and end in identical \nresults.\n.  Before examining this transformation of method, we must briefly \nrecall that political economy has changed its object, and almost its \nnature, as a consequence of the enormous accumulation of eco- \nmic facts. Economic facts have been rendered more numerous and \nmore enormous— and this is not the least effect of technique in \neconomic life. The definition of economic science has hence be­\ncome more and more complex and comprehensive. Without seek­\ning to note all the points of the curve, let two definitions suffice for"

In the first, economic science was de­\nfined as the “science of wealth.” Its object was primarily acquiring \nwealth and disposing of it. It was therefore an individual and pri­\nvate matter. The objective of political economy is conceived in \nsuch a way today that it is virtually impossible to encompass it in a \nformula. As Marchal shows, we have the problem of satisfying the \nneeds of humanity, co-ordinating the available means of produc­\ntion, modifying existent institutions, and even transforming human \nneeds. These problems must all be studied not on the plane of the \nindividual but on the plane of the social group, and an effort made \nto disengage the laws of these social groups.\nThere is no need to go to the extreme and substitute for the or­\nganization of production the organization of distribution alone, as \nRobert Mosse appears to be doing when he writes: “From the mo­\nment production becomes sufficient, the essential thing is to dis­\ntribute goods and leisure.” Without going that far, it is easy, as \nLange has done, to see the difference between a science of the pro­\nduction of wealth and a science of administration of scarce goods. \nMore and more, the economic fact covers all human activity. Every­\nthing has become function and object of the economy, and this has \nbeen effected by the intermediacy of technique. To the extent that \ntechnique has demanded complete devotion of man or brought to \nlight a growing number of measurable facts, or rendered economic \nlife richer and more complex, or enveloped the human being in a \nnetwork of material possibilities that are being gradually realized, \nit has transformed the object of the economy. The economy now \nbecomes obliged to take into account all human problems. The \ndevelopment of techniques is responsible for the staggering phe­\nnomenon of the absorption by economics of all social activities.\nThe Secret Way\nBut another relation between technique and economy exists: the \nformation of an economic technique. Not only has economic science \nchanged its object and its nature, but it has produced a technique \nwhich is simultaneously a method of knowledge and a method of\n\f\nThe Technological Society (159\naction. Political economy has not renounced its claim to being \nnormative. It seeks not only to grasp reality but also to modify it. \nBut the real relation of these two aspects of economic technique \nis obvious. The method of scientific knowledge as such reacts on the \neconomic milieu and tends to shape it; but this technique is not \n“neutral.\" It does not merely stand ready to do the bidding of any \nrandom doctrine or ideology. It behaves rather with its own \nspecific weight and direction. It is not a mere instrument, but \npossesses its own force, which urges it into determined paths, some­\ntimes contrary to human wishes.\nEconomists, not understanding this, want to disengage their \ntechnique from its “neutrality” and to bring it into the service of \ntheir ends. They reject the definition; “Economics is the science \n[technique!] of efficient choices.” But when they seek to humanize \nthe economy, they learn quickly enough that such attempts lead \ndirectly to the subjugation of the ends to techniques. Those who \npose the problem of ends and propose a humane economy as their \ngoal are the very persons who develop techniques further and en­\nhance their specific weights, as Jacques Aventur has shown. But \nwhereas the overpowering phenomenon of the machine strikes \nhome to everyone and makes plain its influence on economic life, \nthe ways of economic technique are secret and everyone remains \nconvinced of its innocuousness and docility.\nIn order to grasp the nature of economic technique, it is first of all \nnecessary to grasp the reasons for its rise. One of its causes is so \nsimple that I shall mention it only in passing. This is the evolution \nof the sciences in general.\nThe sciences in general, in the twentieth century, have passed \nthrough a crisis of growth characterized by the appearance of cer­\ntain problems of methodology and technique. Economic science \nis likewise abandoning dogmatic positions and deductive methods \nin order to establish exact procedures. This may have taken place \nbefore the first gropings of the infant science had borne definitive \nresults. Many economists believe that the ideal science, which must \nserve all others as model, is physics, and that economic method \nmust approximate the method of physics taken as general type but \nnot as specific means.\nAt the same time economists feel, as a kind of challenge, the in-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYl6o)\neffectiveness of their system. Nothing has exposed the vanity of \npolitical economy better than their contradictory diagnoses and \ntherapies for economic crises. For some the cause of crisis is an un­\nsaleable surplus of goods; for others, insufficiency of production. \nFor some it is an excess of savings; for others, a lack of them. And \nas far as the proposed remedies are concerned, some economists \nwould raise the discount rate and others would lower it. Some hold \nthat wages must be stabilized and others demonstrate that they \nmust be lowered. Such contradictions can only arise from a defect \nof method. And the economists bitterly resent the ironical attitude \nthe public has toward them. One of them recently wrote: “The \npublic believes in the physicist, but it has no confidence in the \neconomist.” Policymakers absolutely cannot rely on what the econo­\nmists say, nor follow their contradictory counsels with respect to \naction. All this, then, made it mandatory to replace the regime of \ntheories, which gave birth to nothing but opinion, with a rigorous \nmethod which “sticks” to facts.\nThe need to stick to the facts became more imperative as the facts \nthemselves became more complex. Here again the effect of tech­\nniques made itself felt. The facts of economic life could be grasped \ndirectly when economic life was still relatively simple, when eco­\nnomic phenomena (for example, at the end of the eighteenth cen­\ntury) presented a picture which, in magnitudes and elements, was \ncompatible with direct experience. But the enormous growth of the \neconomic milieu has made direct apprehension impossible and \nbrought about the decline of corresponding modes of reasoning. \nEveryday logic cannot embrace more than a very limited number \nof data. It was therefore necessary to invent a method correspond­\ning to the increasing complexity and amplitude of economic phe­\nnomena. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a “technical \nstate of mind” appeared which developed mightily toward mid­\ncentury. This state of mind was characterized, first of all, by an \neffort to make a hard and fast separation between what is and \nwhat should be. The doctrinal character of economics was com­\npletely repudiated. The sole interest was in matters of fact. The \ngoal was simply to know scientifically, to accumulate facts, to put \nthem in mutual relation, and, if possible, to explain them by means \nof one another.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (161\nPolitical economy is no longer a moral science in the traditional \nsense. It has become technique and has entered into a new ethical \nframework, which I shall define later on. This represents a de­\ncisive step for the creation of a technique. The technical state of \nmind is likewise evident in the creation of a precise method (which \nmore and more consists in the application of mathematics to eco­\nnomics) and in the precise delimitation of a sphere of action. In \neffect, in order for technique to exist, method must be applied to a \nfixed order of phenomena. In the transition of doctrine to technique, \nthe central idea was the distinction between microeconomics and \nmacroeconomics, as in the work of Francois Perroux, a leader in \nthis inquiry in France.\nWe have here a decisive situation. Microeconomics studies \neconomic phenomena at the human level where the relatively hu­\nmane traditional methods can be applied, where individual de­\ncision is respected, but where the complete application of the tech­\nnical apparatus is not permitted, either with respect to method or \nwith respect to action. The observation of facts on the microeco­\nnomic level does not ipso facto entail action, and to promote action \nis one of the principal characteristics of techniques. Even if \nmicroeconomic inquiry is useful and congenial, it nevertheless ap­\npears to have no future because it pertains to the limited world of \nthe individual\nMacroeconomics, on the other hand, opens all roads to technical \nresearch and application. Technical application presupposes, as we \nhave already noted, measurable magnitudes, elimination of errors \nof judgment, and amplitudes of movement wide enough for tech­\nnique to have an understandable object. These are precisely the \ncharacteristics of macroeconomic inquiry. There is no doubt that \nthe methods of macroeconomics are still somewhat uncertain, and \nmany phenomena are recalcitrant to it (for example, scientific tech­\nniques applicable to revenues). Nevertheless, this is the domain a \npriori of technique and we can be assured, as a consequence, that \nthis is where the really effective forces will be concentrated. We are \nlikewise assured that microeconomics, far from being an element in \nthe foundation of macroeconomics, or a complementary element to \nit, will be absorbed. It will lose its reason for existence to the extent \nthat macroeconomics develops surer techniques. We are heading\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMtl 6 s )\ntoward a society in which knowledge of microeconomic phenomena \nwill be the result of simple deduction from knowledge of macro- \neconomic phenomena.\nThe technicians in these new disciplines all have one trait in \ncommon: the joy of constituting a closed group in which the lay­\nman has no part at all. This represents an unconscious tendency; but \nwe observe it among many modern economists in the form of a se­\ncret technique, an esotericism, a certain contempt for whatever \ndoes not belong to its new world of means.\nThis “pride of youth\" always appears among technicians when \nthey are convinced that their new method is unassailable and that \ntheir discoveries are becoming the center of things. The authority \nin which they clothe themselves takes the form of a secret vocabu­\nlary which is incomprehensible to the outsider even when it is em­\nployed, as often happens, to enunciate the most obvious facts. \nTechnique always creates a kind of secret society, a closed frater­\nnity of its practitioners. It is a new thing in the milieu of economics \nto note a kind of studied incommunicability. Up to now, every man \nwith a little education was able to follow the works and theories of \nthe economists. To be able to follow them today, one would have to \nbe both a specialist and a technician. The technique itself is difficult \nand the necessary instruments cannot be managed without previ­\nous education. And there is that caprice of many economists to \nconstitute themselves a closed society. These two factors coincide, \nindicating the grave consequence of excluding the public from the \ntechnical life. Yet it can scarcely be otherwise.\nTechnique as a general phenomenon (as we shall see when we \nstudy the political milieu) always gives rise to an aristocracy of \ntechnicians who guard secrets to which no outsider has access. De­\ncisions which have a serious basis take on the appearance of arbi­\ntrary and incomprehensible decrees. A cleavage like this, which is \ninevitable in the advance of technique, is decisive for the future of \nthe democracies. Economic life, not in its content but in its direc­\ntion, will henceforth entirely elude popular control. No democracy \nis possible in the face of a perfected economic technique. The de­\ncisions of the voters, and even of the elected, are oversimplified, in­\ncoherent, and technically inadmissible. It is a grave illusion to be­\nlieve that democratic control or decision-making can be reconciled \nwith economic technique. Little by little the elements necessary to\n\f\nThe Technological Society (163\nthe creation of this technique are taking shape; and soon they will \nbe perfected.\nThe Economic Techniques of Observation. I do not intend to \ndescribe these instrumentalities; I am concerned here solely with \nexhibiting them as an ensemble.\nThe principal instruments which have been developed are: statis­\ntics, accounting procedures, the application of mathematics to eco­\nnomics, the method of models, and techniques of research into \npublic opinion. It is evident that these elements reciprocally con­\ndition one another.\nAt the base of the structure lies statistics, the instrumentality for \ndetermining the raw facts of economics. At one time statistical data \nwere ridiculed on the ground that they were misleading. But this \nstage lies behind us, and nowadays a large measure of confidence \nrests in the precision of such data. This change has resulted, in part, \nfrom a change in the state of mind of the statisticians themselves. \nThey are immersed in a “statistical atmosphere” and comply with \nthe quantitative and numerical practices of the modem world. To \nstatisticians, statistics is no longer a mere game; it is an essential \noperation of society. This represents a change not only in perspec­\ntive and in seriousness, but also in basic position. For a long time \nstatistics was the work of amateurs; today it is a complex organiza­\ntion of specialists. It has become a profession and, as a conse­\nquence, is practiced much more earnestly. Moreover, the statisti­\ncians have at their disposal increasingly precise instruments. Among \nthese instruments (which have transformed administrative as well \nas statistical technique) are the calculating machine, the punched- \ncard machine, and microfilm. Not only has the speed of operation \nbeen prodigiously accelerated, but also its precision and its dimen­\nsions. By means of microfilm, hitherto uncombinable elements can \nbe combined; and by means of the electronic brain, operations can \nbe effected which the human brain could never perform.\nThe statistician is, materially speaking, in a position to perform \nconvincingly. This is even more evident in the utilization of statisti­\ncal data. As we shall see, the combination of the elements is essen­\ntial, and this combination becomes feasible largely through the \nintermediacy of the machine.\nA final element increases the professional seriousness of the statis­\nticians: their responsibility. In democratic countries, it lies in the\n\f\n164 )  TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY\nrealm of private enterprise; the various organs concerned with sta­\ntistical data in effect sell their studies to the great corporations \nwhich must know precisely, for example, the course of a market. If \nthe information proves inexact, the statistician can be sued in \ncivil court, at least in the United States. In countries under authori­\ntarian rule, responsibility is a public matter; in the Soviet Union the \nstatistician who gives false information is regarded as a saboteur.\nThese elements together make modern statistical data more and \nmore precise. The great scope of statistical operations and of the \norgans involved generally escapes the nonspecialist. To give a sin­\ngle example, there are in the United States fifty-six federal agencies, \neach of which specializes in one or several statistical categories. Al­\ntogether, twelve categories of weekly statistics are published. One \nof these, the category of price, takes in four elements. One of these \n(gross price) comprehends 1,690 weekly quotations combined \nin 890 series. This indicates the extreme complexity of the opera­\ntion. It must become even more complex when interpretation is \nundertaken.\nAll this work is not motivated by pure scientific interest. It is \noriented toward action. Permanent inquiry of this sort is no longer \ninstituted to construct or support doctrines but rather to relate in­\nformation to action. In order to succeed in effecting this connection, \ninterpretation is necessary, and this is the principal task of the tech­\nnical discipline called econometrics.\nEconometrics is distinct from mathematical economics. It is much \nmore theoretical. Its principal operations on statistical data are two­\nfold: (1) analysis, comprising operations such as simplification or \ndissociation of statistical data; and (a) comparison, which can be \napplied to different kinds of elements. Magnitudes can be com­\npared by establishing what are called equations of regression, \nwhich express a constant relation between two magnitudes of the \neconomic domain. Variations can also be compared; here a correla­\ntion index is established, according to which two economic phe­\nnomena vary in direct or in inverse proportion but with the same \nvelocity. Within the same realm, the econometrician tries to estab­\nlish certain relations: no fact in the economic domain can be re­\ngarded as due to chance; and not satisfied with simply noting and \ngiving the correlation formula, the econometrician goes further and\n\f\nThe Technological Society (165\nestablishes the causal relation between two phenomena, a proce­\ndure which leads into the future.\nUntil recently, economists operated on concrete data alone. But, \nfor the purposes of action, they must make predictions. A distinction \nmust be drawn between predictions which are made according to \nthe system of covariations, and causal explanations of phenomena. \nHere the economist leaves the purely technical realm. An equation \nno longer provides the solution; there is a certain subjectivity, a cer­\ntain personal judgment. To be sure, it is present in the various \nother operations, but to a lesser degree.\nEconomic technique has taken over a variety of other means; for \nexample, stochastics, the application of the calculus of probabilities \nto economic phenomena. This technique is extraordinarily difficult \nto handle. It does not operate on raw figures but on statistical data, \non data furnished by econometrics (as, for example, the coefficients \nof elasticity), and on the data furnished by public-opinion research \ninstitutes. In connection with the third element, it is evident that \neconomic phenomena are not mechanical; opinion plays a role. In \na very simplified way, it might be said that stochastics seeks to es­\ntablish a law of probability, or of the frequency, of a given event, \nstarting with a very large number of observations. Stochastics, \ntherefore, represents an instrument of prediction which gives the \ndirection of the most probable evolution of the situation.\nThis stochastic calculus is limited only by the nature of the eco­\nnomic and social milieu. For example, if a given law is exact, the \npublic which is informed of it tends to react in the inverse sense. \nBut sometimes it reacts by conforming to the law. The act of predic­\ntion is thus in a sense self-falsifying. But the public, by so reacting, \nfalls under the influence of a new prediction which is completely \ndeterminable. The economist is able to establish laws of probability \nfor all deviations of opinion. It must be assumed, however, that \none remains in the framework of rational behavior. The system \nworks all the better when it deals with men who are better inte­\ngrated into the mass, men whose consciousness is partially para­\nlyzed, who lend themselves willingly to statistical observations and \nsystematization. The results obtained by this technique are impres­\nsive, even though tlie technique is still immature.\nMuch more classical, and of a different order, is the whole com-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY166)\nplex of accounting techniques. These techniques have been much \nmodified and no longer belong merely to the realm of enterprise \nbut rather to that of economics. The accountant is no longer a mere \nagent for registering the movement of funds in an enterprise. Ac­\ncording to the Lutfalla report published by the Conseil ficonomique, \n1948, he has become a veritable “profits engineer.” His operations \nencompass not only money but all the elements of production. He \nis oriented toward the past and also toward the future. The more \ncomplex manufacturing operations become, the more necessary it \nis to take adequate precautions and to use foresight. It is not possi­\nble to launch modem industrial processes lightly. They involve too \nmuch capital, labor, and social and political modifications. De­\ntailed forecasting is necessary. We shall meet this question again \nwhen we discuss planning, but it is appropriate here to call atten­\ntion to the so-called “input-output” techniques Leontieff has \npointed out. These represent a method designed to establish in a \nprecise, numerical way the interconnections among all sectors of \nproduction techniques. They determine for each sector what is \nbought from and sold to the others. This method makes it possible \nto establish in detail what raw materials, instruments, tools, and \nmachines are required to produce a given product. Under present \nconditions, one can no longer fix magnitudes approximately or be \ncontent with mastering certain key subjects. For even a very ordi­\nnary commodity, two or three hundred basic elements must be \ntaken into account. Exact quantities, weights, and times must be \nfixed. The necessary calculations can only be performed with the \nhelp of computing machines. With this method the well-known and \nhackneyed formula— that everything is reciprocally dependent—  \nbecomes a rigorous reality. But it is the technical elements which \nare reciprocally dependent, welded together by a common neces­\nsity and expressed in certain new techniques.\nWhat holds for the private accountant is even more true for the \npublic accountant who works on a nationwide scale. There are \ncertain differences between the two insofar as enterprise has pri­\nvate profit as its end. As a consequence of the profit motive, the pri­\nvate accountant must comply with the rules of capitalist manage­\nment. The public accountant (who becomes an accountant of \ninitiative) draws up balance sheets and future revenue potentials \nfor a complex organism whose reactions are slow and of great am-\n\f\nThe TechnobgicalSociety (167\nplitude when referred to the impulses at their origin. If public en­\nterprise behaves in any way like capitalist enterprise, its internal \ndynamism complies with certain laws. The role of the accountant \nis to discover these laws. The eif ects of this new revenue-calculating \neconomic technique, which relates economic effects to their causes, \nare easily seen in fields such as the liquor industry, housing, trans­\nportation, and so on. It is clear that this calculated revenue poten­\ntial bears not merely on money but also on human capital. France \ndoes not yet have a central accounting service which could com­\npletely exploit this technique and establish a measurement of social \nneeds, means of production, movement of capital, national income, \nand demographic change, etc.\nReturning to the methods of pure economic technique, we find \nthe metl^od of models. It is extremely difficult to experiment in eco­\nnomic matters. But experimentation is indispensable in all sciences \nand even more so in techniques. As Vincent puts it, a model is a \n“simplified but complete representation in its numerical aspect of \nthe economic evolution of a society; for example, a nation during a \ngiven period.” A model is a reproduction in miniature of a certain \neconomic ensemble in the form of mathematical equations. It is im­\npossible, obviously, to put all economic phenomena into a model; a \ncertain arbitrariness is called for. The primary act is therefore a \nchoice, founded on some theoretical decision, of the constants and \nvariables to be put into the model. This theoretical decision, how­\never, is not arbitrary. It is guided by certain principles, in particular \nthe necessity of linking observation to action. Once the constants \nand the variables of the system have been selected (and they may \nbe numerous), the relations between them are established. Some \nof these relations are evident in the sense that they are purely \nquantitative; others are more unstable and subjective and must be \nestablished by the economic technician himself. They are empirical \nrelations, verified or proven false by experiment Finally, the en­\nsemble of these relations must be put in the form of equations by \ninsertion of the time factor. Then, by solving the equations, it \nis possible to study the evolution of the system and its incidences. \nThis facilitates the study of the evolution of certain mechanisms \ndetermined by a social group, or of the incidence of some ex­\nterior intervention into an economic system, or of the influence \nand importance to the whole of every element in an ensemble.\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY168)\nModels can be purely theoretical or historical, as when the data \narise from statistics (in which case they must be tested against \nthe actual evolution of society). Or they can be predictive, as when \nthe attempt is made to forecast the future. These predictive models \nare the object of great interest in the study of economic complexes.\nThe last of these new economic techniques which I wish to de­\nscribe in this brief review is public-opinion analysis. Everyone is ac­\nquainted with the Callup Institute, which has branches in almost \nevery country of the world. Various systems (soundings, sam­\nplings, inquiries) are used to establish periodically the feelings of a \ngiven class or category of the population; about any important \nquestion. Certainly, there is strong skepticism about these methods. \nNo one believes that he thinks and acts like his neighbor. No one is \nsympathetic to the notion that he is a mere number in some list or \nseries; and this unconscious rejection makes for skepticism. None­\ntheless, the results of such samplings must be deemed valid, in \nspite of the seeming (but easily explainable) setbacks they suffer, \nas, for example, in the well-known case of the American presiden­\ntial elections of 1948. The results reflect various phenomena: soci­\nological currents, ethical preferences, and political opinions with \nwhich we here are not concerned. But other results reflect eco­\nnomic currents: opinions concerning prices and wages, commer­\ncial choices, urgent economic needs (to the extent that they are \nmeasurable), and so on. In sum, anything in the nature of an opin­\nion which can be grasped by a good observer or reporter will hence­\nforth be numerically measured and followed scientifically during \nall stages of its development. This method represents a great revo­\nlution; it permits the integration of opinion in the technical world \nin general and in economic technique in particular. This system \nbrings into the statistical realm measures of things hitherto unmeas­\nurable. It effects a separation of what is measurable from what is \nnot. Whatever cannot be expressed numerically is to be eliminated \nfrom the ensemble, either because it eludes numeration or because \nit is quantitatively negligible. We have, therefore, a procedure for \nthe elimination of aberrant opinions which is essential to the \nunderstanding of the development of this technique. The elimi­\nnation does not originate in the technique itself. But the investi­\ngators who utilize its results are led to it of necessity. No activity \ncan embrace the whole complexity of reality except as a given\n\f\nThe Technological Society (169\nmethod permits. For this reason, this elimination procedure is \nfound whenever the results of opinion probings are employed in \npolitical economy.\nThe economist is thus provided with an arsenal of technical \nmeans which enable him to observe and sometimes to predict eco­\nnomic reality in detail. Then the following question is unavoidable: \nWill these techniques remain simple techniques of observation, of \npure knowledge? We grant that their creators had no ulterior mo­\ntives. The means are there simply to be of assistance to economic \nscience. But will this motive be adhered to? Let us consider the \nposition of the economist as J. U. Nef has described it. The econo­\nmist, more or less stricken with an inferiority complex in regard to \nthe public, “abandoning the hope of affecting policy by objective \nthinking, seeks refuge by becoming an expert and counselor on \nquestions of technology or practical politics.” Economists cherish \nthe hope of influencing reality. The technique of knowledge the \neconomist is now acquiring allows him, through the state, to exer­\ncise this influence. We note this in all countries, no matter what \ntheir type of economy or form of government. It has been called the \nreign of the experts, but it is in actual fact the reign of the techni­\ncians. Economists today have the means of being technicians near \nthe seat of state power. But even without wishing to take account \nof this tendency, we know that these means of observation of reality \nwill not remain inert. Like all techniques, they possess specific \nweights and direction. The reasons are very simple.\nAn organization for establishing statistical data is extremely \ncostly and cannot continue without profits. One way of making \na profit is to sell statistical products to a capitalist clientele, which \nwill utilize them to guide its business into certain channels. A  \nstatistical bureau then becomes a counseling bureau. But the \nuse of statistical data in a semiliberal capitalist economy is re­\nstricted and cannot be developed to its full effectiveness. This \nincapacity of capitalism correctly to employ techniques appears \ntime and again. Mumford says: \"One of the most flagrant faults of \ncapitalism is not to have known how to make use of existing lab­\noratories, for example, the Bureau of Standards, to determine \nnorms from which the whole body of consumers would have bene­\nfited.” The tendency of technological society is to determine the \nmovements of the macroeconomy; yet it is striking to note that sta-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY170 )\ntistics, once established, tend to revert to the level of the micro- \neconomy and individual decision, and to find employment only on \nthis level. This is obviously insufficient; the economists are in a \nposition to lay claim to something better than a clientele which, \nin any case, seldom enables them to cover their costs. They must \naddress themselves to the state. Certain semipublic corporations \nfinance the operations, but it is clear that the state demands its \nquid pro quo. If the state is to pay for statistical research, it must \nget something in return; assistance in directing national affairs. \nThe state requires the economist, on the basis of statistics, to seek \nout methods of intervention either directly or by subtle means \nsuch as those advocated by John Maynard Keynes. When the \ngreat private corporations or the state ask the economist for a \nmethod to influence reality, they are addressing the economist’s \nown invincible longing, which in the beginning engendered the \nimprovement of these scientific means. Suppose that we have ac­\ncumulated enormous quantities of facts, have encompassed the \nwhole of reality, and possess the means to follow the mechanism of \neconomic phenomena and even to a certain degree to predict them. \nShall this accumulated force, then, serve no purpose? The 195* \nreport of the American Bureau of Labor Statistics shows clearly \nthat this ensemble of means leads inevitably to planning.\nWe confess that we are unable to follow Closon’s reasoning \nwhen he declares that the operations of the Compabilite Nationale \nare not a threat to freedom because, in fact, they are not applied. \nOnce the trends of the economy have been recognized and re­\nduced to numerical form, will it be tolerated that no intervention \nbe undertaken when the catastrophic consequences of some de­\ncision or other have been clearly perceived?\nOn a more modest but still significant plane, what meaning has a \ndetailed accounting of all the needs of a thoughtless worker (in­\ncluding the number of springs in his mattress and the number of \nrazor blades he uses annually), undertaken in order to establish a \nminimum wage, if he can spend his money haphazardly? Mere pre­\ndiction would plainly be absurd. The irrationality of the individual \nkeeps him from living on the amount he could live on according to \ncalculations. He would die of hunger on a subsistence minimum, \nunless an authoritarian education made him conform.\nLet us grant that this represents no more than a temptation to\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 71\nthe economist. But it would require superhuman strength not to \nyield to this temptation once action becomes possible; the more so \nbecause the informational techniques described are closely con­\nnected to techniques of action, as are the establishment of norms or \nof accounting plans. We have distinguished somewhat arbitrarily \nbetween knowledge and action in order to present in the most ob­\njective way possible the normal development of economics pro­\nduced by the creation of these techniques. Even when they serve \nsolely for the purposes of knowledge, it is clear by how many routes \nthey, end in intervention. Econometrics is only to be understood if \nit issues in its normal end, the establishment of economic plan­\nning. Without this, econometrics is inefficient, and efficiency is the \nvery law of technique. Like a horse chafing at the bit, the tech­\nniques of economic science await the signal to intervene more com­\npletely than ever before in the reality they have come to under­\nstand.\nThe Economic Techniques of Action. At the same time that the \neconomist has created a technique for knowing, he has created a \ntechnique for acting. A new world is awakening, an economic mu­\ntation is being effected. Among these techniques of intervention we \nshall consider only two: plan and norms.\nThe establishment of norms by the economist has become neces­\nsary, Dieterlen tells us, simply in order to follow and understand \neconomic development (A good example of the transition from \ntechniques of understanding to techniques of action.) It is not \nsufficient merely to follow the course of statistical data. It is neces­\nsary to erect in advance a system of norms of progression of the \nelements of a given economic system which will permit us at any \nmoment to estimate the divergence of a given element of the sys­\ntem from the norm. Even in a nondirected economy, it is possible \nto determine (a) a certain relation among the different economic \ncomponents; (b ) a “normal” tendency for the evolution of each of \nthese elements; and, consequently, (c) a “normal” evolution of \ntheir relation. When such a scheme has been established, it is then \npossible to say whether one of the elements is progressing too rap­\nidly or too slowly, a fact which, in Dieterlens opinion, should \nserve to reveal the causes of an economic crisis.\nBut if we thus establish certain norms of progression, we are con­\nfronted with two facts. First, the necessity of intervention: once\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMT27* )\nthe norm has been set and a condition which diverges from k has \nbeen observed, it would be folly to permit a dangerously abnormal \nphenomenon to develop. Second, the possibility of extending such \nan establishment of norms. Why should inquiry be limited to a \ngiven system? Once a calculus of norms is possible, it ought to be \nextended throughout the economy. This legislative tendency \nwill operate not merely in the area of the organization of labor. A \nbureau for setting standards, or a service of industrial analysis, is no \nlonger limited to the co-ordination, say, of wages and of the scien­\ntific organization of labor. These operations transcend the level of \nprivate enterprise and attain the level of the general. They har­\nmonize the complementary activities of wide economic sectors. We \nare then completely within the technique of intervention; the tran­\nsition from the one to the other has been imperceptible.\nIf the term norm is taken in its exact meaning, it is evident that \nthe application of the system of norms orients us in a unique direc­\ntion. Under capitalism, norms are fundamental to the planning of \nenterprise, but the tempo of production remains a function of mar­\nket conditions. In a planned economy, norms are fundamental to \nall economic calculations. They determine the quantities to be pro­\nduced and measure the degree to which the plan is realized in the \nmarket (Fedotov). The technique of normalization can only have \nfull scope in a planned economy. It tends, in proportion to its devel­\nopment, to imply a planned economy, simply because it tends to \npass from private planning and an atomized economy to a global \neconomy and general planning (the fundamental condition of its \napplication). A  global economy is more exact to the degree that \nboth these aspects of planning are subject to the law and control of \nthe machine, as Mas indicates.\nAll this represents a tendency rather than an accomplished fact \nAs soon as industrial normalization intervenes, it brings with it \nthis tendency which inevitably devalues the older economic types \nand the older industrial organizations.\nNorms mutually entail each other and presuppose certain syn­\nchronizations. It is almost impossible to conceive of localized \nnorms. If it is asked what the motive force behind this tendency is, \nonce again we must answer: efficiency. The logic of norms was \nclearly evident in the application in Britain in 1940 of the National \nResearch Project. Research on the measure of production and its\n\f\nThe Technological Society l 1 73\npractical consequences spread like a slick of oil and brought the \nwhole of industry into line. It has been praised as \"political econ­\nomy entering into action.\"\nThis \"chain reaction\" is also only a tendency at the moment It is \nclaimed that counteracting factors, economic and human, will pre­\nvent it from becoming a reality. But these other factors are not tech­\nnical. The competition is between divergent forces, the one techni­\ncal, the others not And in our society the technical factor must pre­\nvail over the others. I therefore believe that in this area, too, the \nlogic of norms will impose itself everywhere. And if in my analysis \nof this development I seem to have isolated the technical factor, \nthis is not because I choose to neglect or fail to recognize the others. \nBut, as I have already demonstrated, the technical factor is at pres­\nent the decisive one. In addition, most of the other developmental \nfactors are well known and almost universally studied, whereas \nthe technical factor remains, in general, obscure.\nAs soon as norms become essential because of their obvious util­\nity, they appear to complement the plan. There is no better means \nof co-ordinating them or permitting them their full efficiency than \nto integrate them into a plan. This is what I mean by the logic of \nnorms.\nAnother technique of intervention which has recently become \nessential (and which I shall only mention) is so-called operational \nresearch. Its basic characteristics, its objectives, and its meaning are \nidentical with those of norms. But the problem here is a problem of \ndecision. Norms and operational research are today the two means \nby which the plan is executed.\nPlanning represents a second aspect of the economic technique \nof intervention. Everyone has an approximate idea of what plan­\nning means: the state decides everything and regulates everything \nin advance. We must analyze at least the characteristics of the plan­\nning operation, if not its details. Economic planning is a variety of \ntechnique, not a form or a system or an economic theory. Not a \nsingle economy of any type whatsoever has been constructed by \nmeans of planning. We think otherwise because the Russian ad­\nventure has always appeared to us in such a guise. “It was desired \nto build an economy of the collective type and to succeed in this a \nplan was elaborated.\" But the Russian plan assumed its own mean-"

In reality, the plan is a \ntechnique and ipso facto indifferent to doctrines and opinions; it is \nleast of all concerned with principles of action. In Germany no one \nhad any very clear concept of the economic form that should be \nadopted, but planning was accepted as an efficient means. In our \nown day, it is even more true that plans develop in all countries \nwithout any foundation of economic doctrine. This, in one sense, is \nvery reassuring. People constantly say: “If we remain true to our \nold doctrine and the plan is only an instrument, we remain what \nwe were. If planning has sometimes functioned as a socialist in­\nstrument, it was only because it was in the service of socialist doc­\ntrines.” This is, as consolation, illusory. But it is at least founded on \nthe truth that planning is not connected with any particular doc­\ntrine. System or not, however, it perhaps implies a certain definite \nform of economy.\nA second observation leads us to insist on the importance of \n“ways and means” in the establishment of the plan. The plan is not \nmerely a set of commands or some general orientation. There are \ntwo focuses in the plan. There is the choice of objectives, the direc­\ntion to give to an economic system in its ensemble. There is also the \nmost concrete possible anticipation of the means needed to reach \nthese objectives. Economic choice of objectives and the establish­\nment of corresponding means— such is die plan. But this choice and \nthese means are elaborated in the most rational possible way, and a \nwhole complex of techniques of application enables the user to \navoid arbitrariness. With regard to the techniques of the forma­\ntion of a plan, we refer the reader to the works of Charles Bettel- \nheim.\nNow let us consider a great difficulty which is an important point \nof discussion in modem planning: prices and wages. Until now, the \nplan has been more or less tied to “real” prices and wages. Plan­\nning, if not actually established by the market, was at least fixed in \ntemporal or spatial relation to market prices and wages. But this \nsituation could not last long. The intention of the third Soviet \nplan was precisely to fix prices and wages in a purely abstract, but \nnot arbitrary, way by certain econometric methods, independently \nof the laws of the market. It would seem from the various wage \nmanipulations which took place in 1949, and the repudiation of \nVosnessenski, that this attempt was not a success. However, we\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 1 7 5\nmust consider it as the only logical way in which planning could \nthen have been undertaken. And this approach may vesy well be \neliminated by new improvements in economic technique. This \nwould set to rest the objections of Francis Perroux, for whom the \nplan was thereby deprived of all \"economic rationality.”\nA plan is executed in accordance with two constant principles: \nefficiency and social need. The plan first answers the constant \nsearch for the most efficient use of mechanical means, natural \nriches, and disposable forces. The problem is to organize, co-ordi­\nnate, and normalize these elements in such a way that each instru­\nment produces its'maximum yield. Planning has been criticized on \nall fronts, from the philosophic to the economic. But no one has yet \nquestioned the fundamental efficiency of planning, except at the \nbeginning. This criticism had its origin in two things, the gropings \nof the planners and the ignorance of the critics. Everyone has since \nbecome convinced that the mechanism is efficient— with allowances \nfor a certain bluff that up to now has accompanied planning experi­\nments. As far as technique is concerned, judgment is based solely \non efficiency, and planning appears fully justified in this respect.\nThe second of the two principal criteria of planning is the satis­\nfaction of social needs. The initial difficulty is to determine just \nwhat these needs are at a given moment How shall we effect the \nbalance between social needs and production? Theoretically these \nare insoluble questions (I say theoretically advisedly). The pro­\nposed means (opinion polls, ration cards, obligatory absorption by \nthe buyer of whatever is produced) indicate that the question as it \nis usually posed is abstract If one says: “In planning, the consumer \nis in command,” one is making abstraction from the fact that the \nplan, a sociological phenomenon, answers to social need and not to \nindividual need. At the same time one is thinking of an abstract \nman (a kind of fixed image of man), and this, too, renders the pro­\nposed question inoperative. The social man envisaged by the plan \nis a man integrated more and more into modem technical society. \nHis needs are more and more collectivized, not indeed by direct \npressure, but by publicity, standardization of goods, intellectual \nuniformity, and so on. It is well-known that “to the standardization \nof production corresponds a standardization of taste which gives to \nsocial life its collective character.” Moreover, mass consumption \ncorresponds spontaneously to mass production. There is no need\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY176)\nfor repressive measures. The adaptation of the public occurs of it­\nself. The average man becomes the norm in the most liberal system \nin the world because only the products necessary to the average \nman are offered on the market. In fact, the problem of understand­\ning social needs is complicated only if planning technique is sepa­\nrated from all the other techniques. These other techniques spon­\ntaneously lead men to feel certain social needs conformable to \ncertain data. When the plan is reinserted into its true framework, it \nis evident that there is no need of forcing social needs. They are \nprepared in advance, so that the plan is in a position to correspond \nexactly to them, after a more or less difficult period of adaption.\nThe whole evolution of human needs, in their “sociologism,” \ntends toward the plan. There is almost no necessity any longer to \nexert pressure on these needs. They are already what they should \nbe, provided that we abandon human misfits to their miserable lot, \na procedure which is, in any case, the course of all techniques. \nWhen it is a question of dominating the world, one cannot stop to \nconsider Kirgiz shepherds or Bantu huntsmen who will not accept \nthe-kws of the determining forces.\nPlanning does not pretend to produce an immediate response to \nall social needs. As I have said, there is choice. It is choice which \ncan render certain persons unhappy but not hopeless, because the \nplan is inserted into a dynamic conception of the economy. The \n-  equilibrium between production and consumption is neither static \nnor does it exist at present It is to come, and will constantly re­\nnew itself. The choice effected at a given moment is placed in a \ngeneral perspective which makes this choice relative, and at the \nsame time subordinate, to subsequent foreseeable development It \nis necessary therefore to consider both the future of realization \nand the mechanism of unitomnization of needs (which I have al­\nready mentioned). This leads the two lines to come together con­\nstantly. This is an element of the dialectical view of the eeenomy, \nwhich is the only one admissible today. During the realization of a \nplan, a constant readaptation of means and ends is simultaneously \neffected, assuring a greater cohesion of the ensemble, if not a \ngreater certainty of realization.\nFinally, it seems to me important, in connection with the plan \nitself, to emphasize the need for utilizing the labor force efficiently. \nIt would appear that full employment is an internal necessity, not"

And since the techniques \nof economic observation, if they are to have their full scope, issue \ndirectly in the technique of planning, and since there can be no \nquestion of renouncing the youthful vigor of these mathematical \nmethods, how is it possible not to see them through to the end?\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYI ? 8 )\nYet a certain disquiet has appeared among those who cherish \nhuman freedom and democracy. They ask if planning is not an all- \nconsuming force. They seek to set three kinds of limits to its power, \nrepresented by: (a) flexible planning, (b) the system of limited \nplanning, and (c) the separation of the planning agency from the \nstate (in short, what is usually called the reconciliation of liberty \nand socialism). No one accepts Friedrich August von Hayek’s \nproposition (in his Road to Serfdom) that planning is essentially \nevil. Conscientious economists are unable to renounce technical \ndiscovery. They seek a middle term.1  Is it to be a limited plan? But\n1  See a com pendium  of ideological illusions concerning planning and liberty con* \ntained in a recent special num ber devoted to this question in the Indian Journal of Political Science. Ten or so articles attem pt to dem onstrate that planning is indeed \nindispensable but that it presents no danger at all to freedom. A complete unreality \ncharacterizes these articles. The position of the authors can be sum m arized as \nfollows.\nFirst, they express the hope of saving freedom  through liberal and partial plan* \nning. (However, other authors in the sam e volume show that this hope is absurd \nanu ineffective.)  Second, the articles contain other form ulas, equally absurd and \nw ithout content. “Planning should have as its object the realization of freedom '*; \n“The m ore rational planning becomes, the greater the freedom  of toe people.” These \nare m ere affirm ations, and one would seek in vain for corresponding realities or for \na possible content\nSom e of these authors rely for proof of their propositions on a series of sim ple \nsyllogism s. For example; “(a) Planning increases production, (a) Production allows \nthe satisfaction of m ore needs. (3) The satisfaction of needs is the condition of \nfreedom . Hence, planning is the condition of freedom.” This reasoning is faulty for \ntwo reasons. It is linear and takes no account of the complexity of the facts (for \nexam ple, put a m an in prison, give him  everything he needs; he is nonetheless \nfree). It derives its conclusion partly from  an economic premise (the first) and \npartly from an ethical prem ise (the third), without attempting to distinguish the \nlogical planes on which these prem ises lie. The third prem ise is, in any case, wholly \nquestionable from  a spiritual or ethical point of view. (I shall return later to a \ndiscussion of this.)\nBut for these authors the principal hope of saving freedom , in  this amazing theory, \nUps to the claim  that an enlightened public opinion has the oower to direct the \ndecision of the planners toward the satisfaction of its real needs. In this case, one \nwould indeed have dem ocratic planning, collectivism on a voluntary base. But to \nreason like this is surely to move in  a world of dream s. The good faith of these \nintellectuals com pels one to think seriously of pathology.\nCan anyone really believe that, if public opinion wanted pastry shops, planning \ncould be oriented toward these institutions, if, in addition, the other uses of flour \nhad to be sacrificed? Can anyone really believe that public opinion would receive \nany satisfaction if it demanded footgear when tractors were needed? Such beliefs \nare sim ple nonsense. It will be maintained that public opinion does not really know  \nwhat it needs . . . But then the technician m akes the decision. We are fam iliar \nenough with the m echanism: first producer goods, then consum er goods. Of course, \npublic opinion will be \"consulted\" after the technician has made his decision: “You \nwould have preferred woolen goods? Technically im possible; we had to m ake them  \nof cotton. Green? Unfortunately, there is no aniline. But you can choose between\n\f\nThe Technological Society (179\nthen the problem is posed: where lies the limit? For some econo­\nmists, planning is a purely economic question bearing on key in­\ndustries. But the debate has lasted a century and no decision has \nbeen reached as to which industries are key industries. The deci­\nsion becomes even more difficult as categories change with time \n(the extraction of uranium, for example, was not a key industry \ntwenty years ago) and as the interpenetration of economic activi­\nties becomes greater and greater. It is becoming extremely diffi­\ncult to analyze the factors involved in production. Every part of the \nsystem is, directly or indirectly, dependent on all the others through \nfinancial repercussions or through the structure of labor. How, \nthen, is it possible to set up a planned sector of the economy along­\nside an unplanned sector? When one rereads what was published \non this problem only ten years ago, it is clear that these studies \nare completely out of date and have been rendered null and void \nby subsequent technical improvements. Let us assume that a plan \nhas been made for a five-year period. If now the attempt is made \nto limit it to economics by allowing the greatest possible freedom \noutside this area (for example, by having no planning in the social \ndomain), how can this economic plan possibly be viable?\nThe problem of financing is necessarily raised even by a flexible \nand limited plan. It was clear, at the time of the discussion of the \nnew phase of the Monnet plan (September, 1950), that bank credit, \nthe appeal to private financing, was insufficient. It was necessary \nto turn to public financing. But this represented an enormous un­\ndertaking, even for the state. The state was obliged to concern it­\nself with the planning of its finances according to the more or less\nlight red and dark red. See what freedom you havef* In effect, these authors \nseek to baptize obedience to technical necessity with the name freedom. They \nattempt to hide the real com pulsions and write either out of blindness or hypocrisy.\nOnly one of these articles is valid. Suda declares: “So much the worse for freedom. \nWe can sacrifice it. In any case, on the plane of values, dedication to the common \ngood is a higher idea) than freedom.** I cannot agree with this, but at least it allows \nus honestly to assess our situation. We encounter the same attempt at justification \n(In general, better supported but as unconvincing) in Entre la planification et la \nliberty, in which Dutch, French, Norwegian, and American authors study the prob­\nlem from very varied viewpoints (Revue Economique, March, 1953).\nThese illusions are contradicted by Tibor Mende himself (India After 12 years, \n1959). He shows that Indian agricultural planning (the communal projects of die \nvillages) collapsed because it was not comprehensive and authoritarian. His com- \narison of India with China is a clear demonstration that, in accordance with the \ncriteria of yield and efficiency (the sole justified criteria of any planning), the most \nauthoritarian methods are the most profitable."

Moreover, it quickly \nbecomes clear that there is a need too for social security ( a neces­\nsary psychological and sociological element if full employment is \nto function without too violent a shock to human nature). This in­\nterrelation is not imaginary and gratuitous. Internal necessity con­\nnects the elements of the plan, and it is folly to think of breaking its \nlinks.\nThus the plan, once adopted as method, tends perpetually to \nextend to new domains. To limit it would be to put the method in \na position in which it cannot function— exactly as though one were \nto construct efficient automobiles but refuse to build adequate \nroads. The car could indeed run on narrow, rutted, and sandy roads, \nbut it would not give the results for which it had been designed. \nCertain complementary given elements become proportionately \nmore numerous as planning improves and modern society becomes \nmore complicated. These mutual relationships render limited plan­\nning impossible. The plan engenders itself, unless technique itself \nis renounced.\nThe same situation holds if the planner aspires to adopt a flexi­\nble plan or one independent of the state. In such a case the fun­\ndamentals of the plan are not obligatory. The plan appears as mere \nadvice concerning what would be desirable; the producers remain \nindependent, the consumers have free choice, and the attitude of the \nindividual prevails over the social The flexible plan is subject to \nconstant revisions and readjustments demanded by universal per­\nsonal freedom. The same holds true if the attempt is made to refer \nthe organization of the plan to agencies other than the state: to \nnarrower organisms, such as administrative divisions of specialized \neconomic organizations; or to organizations of wider scope, as, for \nexample, international organizations. The appeal to international \nbodies is designed to vitiate the criticism of such writers as Hayek \nconcerning the dangers of totalitarianism which arise when the \nState is in charge of the plan.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (181\nThese different proposals are extremely deceptive. The flexible \nplan has only one defect; but that defect is crucial: the plan cannot \nbe realized. The reason is simple. If the plan corresponds to the \nreal nature of planning, it ought to fix objectives, which normally \nwould not be attained by the play of self-interest and a modicum of \neffort. It must stretch productive forces to the maximum, arouse \nenergies, and exploit existing means with the maximum of effi­\nciency. (That planners do not always succeed, that administrative \nerrors occur, and that not all planning invariably acts with the maxi­\nmum efficiency is no more a criticism of the system than errors of \ncalculation are a criticism of mathematics.) But if the individual is \nallowed freedom of decision and there is no plan, he will not make \nthe maximum effort required of him. If the industrialist is allowed \nto retain full independence, he will seek out other arrangements \nand not arrive at the objectives proposed. Hence, the plan, in or­\nder to be realized, must be paired with an apparatus of sanctions. \nThis appears to be a veritable law of economics; planning is in­\nseparably bound up with coercion.\nThe individual does not realize spontaneously what is most ef­\nficient. Nor do the workers conform spontaneously to Gilbreth’s \n“movements.” The following alternative presents itself. Either the \nplan is flexible but is not realized, as experience shows: in spite of \nthe propaganda about the Monnet plan, its objectives were only 70 \nper cent realized. The flexible plan of the Bulgarians (1947) was \n37 per cent realized. The Monnet plan, which ought to have been \ncompleted in 1950, was actually completed in 1953, having taken \ntwice the proposed time. In L’action psychologique (1959), Mai- \ngret restudies the effect on the breakdown of the plan of the ab­\nsence of propaganda (which would have rendered the plan psy­\nchologically compulsory). It is useless to expend the great amount \nof labor which goes into a plan only to reach a stalemate. Or the \nplan must be realized, but at the cost of loading it with sanctions \nso that it becomes more rigid. Those who count on the good will \nof mankind display a delirious, idealistic optimism. Centuries of his­\ntory, despite the facts, have not been able to convince them of the \ncontrary; reason certainly will not change them. But they are so \nfar removed from reality that their opinion is negligible.\nThe problem of sanctions brings planning into relation with the \nstate. Anyone who claims that planning and the state are separable,"

And this suffices to give back to the state all its \nprerogatives. It is evident (and Russia and Germany were no ex­\nceptions) that it is not the state itself which creates the plan, but \nrather some specialized organism more or less dependent on it. \nAs to the TVA, the source of this enterprise was the Roosevelt \ngovernment, which performed operations of expropriation, made \nmeans available, and assured sanctions.\nHow, then, is it possible to retain a belief in the independence \nof the plan? The bond between planning and the state is organic \nand not due to chance. At the minimum, the power of the state is \nrequired for a general examination of available resources and to put \nall the national forces to work. I do not use the word planning in \nthe technical sense, as when one points to school-construction pro­\ngrams or traffic-signal installations. Local entities are of course able \nto execute such programs. But they do not represent planning any \nmore than does dike construction in the Netherlands. If they did, \nthe “planning” of a house by an architect would have to fall under \nthis category. As to international decisions (which might be cited \nas a proof of the separation of the plan from the state), these do \nnot represent plans in the proper sense of the term (for instance, \nthe Bretton Woods agreements). The sole hope of realization of \ninternational plans— for example, in Europe— rests, as we clearly \nsee today, on the existence of a European state. This kind of plan­\nning acquires substance only to the degree that such a state is con­\nstituted. This fact corroborates our thesis. Only a supranational state \nwould be able to convince both the national states and the trusts \nto co-operate in a common economic operatioa The Dawes and \nYoung plans ended in failure because they had no means for genu­\nine sanctions and no political power to support them. Conversely, \nwe note that the Marshall Plan (which became the ECA) is im­\nperceptibly producing a political system. The Atlantic Pact is a cor­\nrelative to the Marshall Plan, and Europe will begin to organize \nitself only in the event that the ECA is seen to be completely use­\nless unless it is applied to a politically ordered world.\nThe Americans understood perfectly that the only alternative to \na useless expenditure of money in the ECA was a European politi­\ncal organization.

But \nthat does not make me believe in such an ideal and take it as a \nreality. In fact, I note that techniques of knowledge engender and \nnecessitate techniques of action, and techniques of action presup­\npose certain conditions and developments in accordance with a \ntrue law which might be called the law of the extension of planning.\nThis extension of planning does not necessarily bring about a so­\ncialist society. Private ownership of the means of production need \nnot be modified in order to have a planned economy. Likewise, \nplanning does not necessarily bring about a dictatorial state. The \nuse of sanctions and propaganda can be accommodated to forms \nother than dictatorships.

I insist on the phrase at the present moment. It means \nnothing to explain that liberal capitalism was extraordinarily effi­\ncient a century ago. The statement is true and we do not wish to \ndeny it. But what of the present moment? If we accept the idea that \ndifferent human systems of action ought to correspond to different \nsocial, political, and economic circumstances, can we uphold the \nthesis that the past efficiency of liberal capitalism is a pledge of \npresent efficiency? Let us remember that from the point of view \nof efficiency the Russian and German planned economies were \nsuccesses. And the United States adopted a planned regime when \nit was challenged by war— it may be added, with all the care and \nprecaution presupposed by the critical democratic sensibility of the \nAnglo-Saxons.\nShortly after reconversion, in 1950, however, the Americans were \nobliged to embark on a new program. It was not merely an arma­\nments program (which had certain advantages in connection with \nfull employment), but a sound program encompassing a group of \ncountries, as indicated by Truman’s Point Four. These programs \npresupposed a planned economy.\nIt would seem that we are today unable to escape the facts. And \nthe facts direct us toward the planned economy, regardless of our \ntheoretical judgments in the matter. It is also often asked whether, \nafter long periods of planned economy, the trend could be reversed. \nBut this is another problem.\nW emustask why these fixed and rigid programs ( which emerge \nin a planned economy) are adopted on a wider and wider scale, \nirrespective of doctrines and intentions. The only reply is that plan­\nning permits us to do more quickly and mure completely whatever \nappears desirable. Planning in modern society is the technical \nmethod. It does not necessarily represent the best economic solu­\ntion, but it does represent the best technical solution. We must de­\nmand of planning what it is able to do, and nothing else. Marchal, \ntherefore, is right in saying that the planned economy is not more \nrational than the market economy. It is not at all certain that it will \nresult in any greater savings. I understand that one of the pre­\noccupations of economic science is whether a result has been at­\ntained in the most economical manner possible. But this is possibly\n\f\nThe Technological Society (185\nonly an abstract point of view and, in any case, is secondary. The \nsame problem arises in war between one general who hesitates to \nsacrifice human life and another general who desires victory at any \ncost and is willing to sacrifice everything to gain it. Unfortunately, \nour experience since the eighteenth century has been that the gen­\neral who hesitates to make the sacrifice is always defeated. The \nsame problem is posed by \"dumping.” In speed, intensity, and co­\nherence, the technique of the plan proves superior. There may be \nwaste. This is not completely certain. But it ought not to be for­\ngotten that the charge of waste was one of the keenest criticisms \nleveled against liberalism. It is possible that waste will be mitigated \nthrough an improvement of the technique. We are not presently \nin a position to say one way or the other.\nThese observations might be summed up in the statement that \nin one case technique exists and in the other it does not. But things \nare not so simple. It is standard practice to set up in opposition \nthe possible solutions; for example, corporatism and planning. But \nwe should guard against the possibility that the contrast is com­\npletely artificial. We should guard against abandoning ourselves \nto the judgment of the specialists. The important question is one of \nperspective. Every system is composed of different elements. W e \ncan put these elements in different perspectives and thereby arrive \nat different judgments. The specialist will fasten on certain specific \nelements. Either he will envisage a given system sub specie aeter- \nnitatis, in which case his judgment will be that the planned econ­\nomy and the corporate economy are clearly not identical. Or he \nwill envisage the system from the viewpoint of practical realization \nin all the facets of its achievements. In this case the structure of a \ncorporation (or the systems of corporative production) will again \nbe judged not to be the same as the structure of the planned econ­\nomy in genuinely concrete details.\nThese elements of a given system, which are important in their \nspecificity, lose importance, however, if, instead of isolating the \nsystem, we try to reintegrate it into the complex of society and \ninto the general course of history. What then takes on importance \nare the elements in their relation. Relations are of the highest im­\nportance, not mere internal consistency. It is the connections be­\ntween the economic system and the state (with its technical \nmeans, different classes, and structures in national form) which be-\n\f\n1 86 ) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMT\ncome characteristic. And we do not mean here theoretical connec­\ntions, but real ones resulting from the internal necessity of the re­\ngime. From this point of view, the corporate economy and the \nplanned economy come singularly close together, to the degree \nthat both systems (a) take a firm hold on the economy, (b) man­\nage it on the basis of exact mathematical methods, (c) integrate it \ninto a Promethean society which excludes all chance, (d) centralize \nit in the frameworks of nation and state (the corporate economy to­\nday has no chance of success except as a state system), (e) cause \nit to assume an aspect of formal democracy to the total exclusion of \nreal democracy, and (f) exploit all possible techniques for con­\ntrolling men. The kinship of the two systems is obvious in spite of \ndifferences in material structure.\nThe end pursued by both the corporate economy and the planned \neconomy, and the means adopted to reach this end, are identical. \nOnly the outward forms change. It is useless to compare these \nforms. History will decide which form is best— best adapted to the \ncommon end.\nIt does not seem to me to be exact, therefore, to hold that there \nare three possible economic pathways. There are only two. And \nonly one of them entails the exploitation of these techniques; the \nother one ascribes the chief place to nature. ( Here again is the old \nopposition between the natural and the artificial, the artificial repre­\nsenting the expression of art: techni.) The complete identity, \nrather than the resemblance, between corporatism and planning \nought to be noted. Corporatism is adapted to a traditional, culti­\nvated, bourgeois mentality; planning, to an innovating, proletarian, \npseudo-scientific mentality. But the attitude of the two is funda­\nmentally the same. And, speaking objectively, the result, insofar as \nthe real structure of human society is concerned, will be identical. \nAs to the choice between the two, the system that can best utilize \nthe techniques proposed by the economists will prevail. Up to \nnow, there is no doubt that the planned society seems better able \nthan the corporate society to utilize these techniques. The cor­\nporate society brings to bear a whole complex of nontechnical \nconsiderations (sentimental or doctrinaire) which the planned \nsociety rejects.\nIt may be objected that in the planned society politics intervene \non a major scale and that this is not technique. I would then ask\n\f\nThe Techndogical Society ( 18  7\nwhat kind of politics is meant. As we shall see, politics have tended \nto become technical in the countries that have adopted planning.\nThe serious study of the opposition between politics and eco­\nnomics, and of the relations between them, dates back perhaps \ntwenty years. This opposition has tended to become less and less \nreal as the two have found a common denominator in technique. \nWhen the economy and the political milieu are simultaneously sub­\njected to technical method, the problem of the interference of \npolitics in the economy ceases to have major importance. It no \nlonger has the same significance as personal influence, private inter­\nest, or moral judgments. The alignment of the two has not yet been \nfully completed— and this constituted the particular weakness of \nHitler’s Germany— but it takes more than a decade to overcome \ntechnically great political and economic machines.\nAll these considerations attest to the fundamental likeness of the \ncorporate economy and the planned economy. Only these two eco­\nnomic attitudes are left. They should not be considered, however, \nin their extreme aspects. A planned society does not imply that \nevery detail is integrated into the plan. Nor does the plan provide \nfor the humblest means. Liberalism, likewise, cannot be understood \nin its entirety. One scarcely speaks any longer of a “liberal inter­\nventionism” in which the distinction is made between the policy of \nstructure (improvement of distribution, etc.) and the policy of pros­\nperity (influence on the economy itself of certain means which have \nbeen decided upon; for example, money). The state no longer \nleaves the economy to itself; but state intervention is flexible enough \nto allow the entrepreneurs some initiative and grant ( controlled) \nfreedom to the market. This is the attitude of the best minds in \nFranee. They are guided not only by a desire for equilibrium and \na traditional confidence in the “middle of the road,” but also by a \npreoccupation with human and nonconformist elements. I do not \ndeny that these elements are desirable, or that attributing a strategic \nrole to the state ( while reserving tactical freedom to the citizens) \nis a tempting concept. But I am searching for the possible here. \nWould such an economic orientation really satisfy technical condi­\ntions? Is it realizable in depth? The answer is certainly yes, if we \nabstract it from reality. But when we come back to reality, it is \nimmediately evident that the liberal orientation represents the most \ndifficult of the possible alternatives. The equilibrium we seek be-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYl88)\ntween technique and freedom and between state and private enter­\nprise is not stable. It is continually being put to the test and must \nbe ceaselessly re-established. The tension required of the individual \nin this struggle seems to me to raise a grave question. Is it feasi­\nble to obtain from the individual ceaseless effort to establish the \nvery framework of his activity? And will his activity within this \nframework be sustained? In other words, is this equilibrium the best \npossible condition for economic development? Will not the energy \nemployed to secure the structural framework be dissipated in some \nother quarter? One must take account, after all, of human nature. \nThis is even more true of a liberally supervised economy than of a \ntotally planned economy, precisely because the former entails a \ncertain degree of freedom for the individual. The human being, \nleft to his own devices, will not choose the most difficult paths or \nthe tightest situation. He will choose the line of least resistance. I \nam speaking of the man of the twentieth century, the product of \nthe society based on ease, security, and comfort \nThe average man like myself, or the entrepreneur of my acquaint­\nance, has no great desire to maintain his equilibrium at the expense \nof a ceaseless re-creating of a failing virtue. Under these conditions, \nhe finds that things go badly. He far prefers a simple solution, \nsummary, no doubt, and brutal, but assuring him an easy road. \nSince means of direct intervention are available, the average person \nprefers that they be used ( unless private interests lead him to prefer \nthe freedom of the great beasts of the jungle). The partisans of di­\nrect intervention present two conditions as necessary to its realiza­\ntion: first, a reform of the state, which is henceforth to transcend \nall private interests and be endowed with competent organisms for \nflexible and concealed intervention; second, a precise and complete \neconomic theory dealing with the sequence of economic events and \nthe means of intervention. These two conditions amount, however, \nto a single condition: the primacy of technique. But then the same \nproblems recur. There is the difficulty of preventing technique from \ngoing to the limit of its potentialities. There is the difficulty pre­\nsented by the conjunction of economic and political techniques \nwhich mutually reinforce one another. And so on Is it credible that \na state which has become really technical (we shall study its char­\nacteristics in the following chapter) will be satisfied with half meas­\nures? Nothing of the kind The seeds of destruction are in the very\n\f\nThe Technological Society (18$\nconditions proposed for the establishment o f the economic form \nrepresented by liberal interventionism. Thence the fundamental in­\nstability which renders the attempt to establish such an economic \nform not a final solution but merely an intermediate stage.\nThis development (that is, from liberal interventionism to the \nfully planned society) is the more certain because liberal interven­\ntionism has usually corresponded neither to the general tendencies \nof society nor to the historical situation. I certainly do not wish to \nimply that such an economic form, from the standpoint of economic \nscience, is not valid or justified. But when considered in the frame­\nwork of today’s reality, it loses its validity.\nThe general tendencies of modern society are too well known for \nme to dwell on the contradictions they offer to liberal intervention­\nism. It is said that this solution, which allows for concessions and \nwould abandon certain values it believes cannot be saved, in order \nto preserve certain others, represents an underhanded way of es­\ntablishing collectivism. My answer is that the problem is essen­\ntially spiritual. The economic orientation called liberal interven­\ntionism, presupposes a spiritual revolution that has not yet even \nbegun.* Again, the historical situation is eminently unfavorable to \nthe philsophy of the “middle of the road.” Herein lies the chal­\nlenge that is made both in war and in peace to peoples seeking to \norient themselves in this direction.\nThe simple presence of the Soviet Union acts as a catalyst and \ntransforms the internal situation of the semiliberal countries, \nwhether they have direct economic relations with the Soviets or not \nHere we have a planned economic system in competition with cer­\ntain other systems. As Marchal has shown, when contact is estab­\nlished, the capitalistic countries, out of commercial necessity, are \nobliged to align themselves with the Soviet system. In other words, \nplanning technique forces the competitors to imitation.\nThis effect has been brilliantly analyzed by Gottfried Haberler. \nHe demonstrates that the development of state socialism and col­\nlectivism is reflected in the whole economic complex and results in \na generalized nationalization of economic activity and in state mo­\nnopolies of foreign commerce. A country engaged in planning its \neconomic activity will establish quantitative controls over foreign\n* I refer the interested reader to m y book Frdience au monde mcdeme.\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOM Y1 9 0 )\ntrade in order to adapt it to the general national planning. Quotas \nand exchange controls are established which are then necessarily \nreflected in the commerce of nations that aspire to free activity. \nHaberler astutely notes that measures of international commerce \ntaken by free nations in response to other countries with planned \neconomies in turn result (if they are co-ordinated and planned) in \na marked degree of internal economic planning. State monopolies of \ninternational commerce cannot result in multilateral and nondis- \ncriminatory commerce. Haberler shows also that commercial agree­\nment on a liberal basis is not possible between nations with a \nplanned economy and nations with a nonplanned economy.\nIn view of the disturbance from abroad, then, how is it possible \nto maintain the delicate mechanisms of the policy of prosperity \nbased on individual enterprise?\nThe planned economy seems to represent the most probable solu­\ntion imposed by economic technique and desired by the greater \npart of modem society, not only of men but of powers.\nThe real problem is not to judge but to understand.\nProgress. Technique, in its action on the economy, awakened vast \nhopes in human hearts. And certainly there is no question of deny­\ning these hopes. The machine and all that came with it, all it \nbrought in the way of progress, would put into human hands riches \nperhaps different but as impressive as those of legend. These riches \nwould not be piles of gold or precious stones reserved for the dar­\nlings of the gods, but comfort and pleasure for everyone. And if the \ncarved palaces, the chests encrusted with coral and enamel, the \nscultpures and objects of gold, the precious table services, the arms \nwith handles of emerald and pearl were all fated to disappear, in \ncompensation every man was promised decent glassware and porce­\nlain, a house in which he could be warm, abundant nourishment, \nand, little by little, comfort and hygienic surroundings that would \nassure him physical and mental harmony. Everyone was to have \nin full measure the wherewithal to live. And, more than that, new \nneeds would arise which would no longer be the rare pleasures of \ninitiates but simply the human condition. To drink chilled bever­\nages in the summer or to be warm in the winter would no longer be \nthe costly fancy of a prince.\nPoverty was retreating and, with it, man’s suffering. The machine \nwas taking over. The time devoted to work remained time wasted;\n\f\nThe Technological Society (19 1\nbut it was constantly decreasing and no one imagined that this \nprocess would ever stop.\nThis extreme view of things developed so rapidly that by the \nend of the nineteenth century people saw in their grasp the moment \nin which everything would be at the disposal of everyone, in which \nman, replaced entirely by the machine, would have only pleasures \nand play. We have had to lower our sights. In practice, things have \nnot turned out to be so simple. Man is not yet relieved of the \nbrutal fate which pursues him. What appeared so near has again \nbeen postponed. Yet two wars, two \"accidents,” have in no way af­\nfected our glorious conception of progress. Spiteful actions of fate, \nhuman errors— call them what they will— men refuse to see in \nthem anything that essentially aifects the marvelous progress that \nopens before them. In spite of accidents, they believe that the road \nis still free. The man of the mid-twentieth century preserves in his \nheart exactly the same expectations as his grandfather had.\nNo doubt he has repudiated what he thought was naive. And \nperhaps a certain distrust keeps him from enjoying the full life to \nthe extent that he might have expected. Even if he is unaware of \nit, the average man preserves in his collective consciousness the \nobscure feeling that he has been duped. He had believed so com­\npletely in the takeover by the machine, and in plenty, and he does \nnot wish to fall into a trap again. Nevertheless, hope persists wher­\never tomorrows beckon; say Hitler’s Thousand Years, or the bour­\ngeois’s stupid notion of progress. The hope is still the same, but the \nhuman being (model 1950) tells himself that he can only attain \nParadise through the destruction of his enemies. His feeling of frus­\ntration— occasioned by the abrupt loss of what was possible and \neven within reach— is one of the elements behind the atrocities of \nmodern wars. When man finds the foe who stands in his way and \nwho alone has barred Paradise to him (be it Jew, Fascist, capitalist, \nor Communist), he must strike him down, that from the cadaver \nmay grow the exquisite flower the machine had promised.\nAll myths directly or indirectly go back to the myth of Paradise; \nand the technical productivity man is witnessing seems to have \nspurred a proliferation of myths. Psychologists and sociologists have \nobserved the appearance of new myths; and many theories have \nbeen advanced to account for this return of man to the sacred \nworld. But such explanations are unsatisfactory because they lack\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY19J*)\na material basis. That material basis is, in fact, the enormous tech­\nnical progress of the modern world. This progress restores to man \nthe supernatural world from which he had been severed, an in­\ncomprehensible world but one which he himself has made, a world \nfull of promises that he knows can be realized and of which he is \npotentially the master. He is seized by sacred delirium when he sees \nthe shining track of a supersonic jet or visualizes the vast granaries \nstocked for him. He projects this delirium into the myth through \nwhich he can control, explain, direct, and justify his actions . . . \nand his new slavery. The myth of destruction and the myth of ac­\ntion have their roots in this encounter of man with the promise of \ntechnique, and in his wonder and admiration.\nIf we consider the theses of the economists, we find that they, \ntoo, affirm the same hope. They locate it elsewhere and prescribe \nconditions and modalities to it, but the foundation is the same. \nTechnique is for them, too, the only means of abundance and lei­\nsure. Fourastie is right in putting the case numerically to dramatize \nthe shortening of the work week and the enormous transformation \nin living standards and in the qualitative nature of life. The case \nis indeed simple if 1950 is compared with 1815. But it is no \nlonger quite so simple if 1950 is compared with 1250. It is impor­\ntant to consider, for labor, not only time but intensity. It is possi­\nble to make a meaningful comparison between the fifteen-hour \nworkday of a miner in 1830 and the seven-hour workday of 1950. \nBut there is no common denominator between the seven-hour day \nof 1950 and the fifteen-hour day of the medieval artisan. We know \nthat the peasant interrupts his workday with innumerable pauses. \nHe chooses his own tempo and rhythm. He converses and cracks \njokes with every passer-by.\nExactly the same holds true for the qualitative nature of life. \nIf a whole people is oriented toward the search for justice or purity, \nif it obeys in depth the primacy of the spiritual, it does not suffer \nfrom the lack of material things, just as we today do not feel the \ninverse need of the spiritual. Such preferences depend on personal \njudgment and on the society concerned.\nWe cannot say with assurance that there has been progress from \n1250 to 1950. In so doing, we would be comparing things which \nare not comparable. Certainly, an airplane which, after all, exists \nconcretely seems like progress, compared with dim historical mem-"

Therefore, it is advisable to limit ourselves to saying that \nthere has been progress since the beginning of the industrial era, \nwhich was founded on the breakup and destruction of the non­\ncomparable and vanished old order. For modern man with his pe­\nculiar orientation— which has material possessions and “stomach* \nas the central values— the period of great hopes indeed arrived. \nAnd these hopes are the same (even if the forms differ) for a man \nmet atrandomandfora great economist.\nHowever, as it is said in England, “you get nothing for nothing, \nand not much for sixpence.* In spite of leisure and abundance, \nsupposing that leisure and abundance come in the way men expect \nthem, there is a great difference between this state and Paradise. \nThe difference has to do with the cost. The old dream that has \ntempted man from the beginning, the medieval legend of the man \nwho sells his soul for an inexhaustible purse, which recurs with an \nenticing insistence through all the changes of civilization, is per­\nhaps in process of being realized, and not for a single man but for \nall. I say perhaps. Modern man never aks himself what he will have \nto pay for his power. This is the question we ought to be asking. \n(And we shall do so later, after we have completed our descrip­\ntion of the technical phenomenon.)\nCentralized Economy. We are now in a position to trace certain \ncharacteristics that technique imposes on the economy of the mod­\nem world. We must recall that there is no accommodation with \ntechnique. It is rigid in its nature and proceeds directly to its \nend. It can be accepted or rejected. If it is accepted, subjection \nto its laws necessarily follows.\nWhat are the effects of these laws on the economic world? The \nfirst trait that can be clearly perceived is the connection between \nthe economic mechanism and the state. This connection exists not \nby virtue of socialist doctrines, nor because the state wills to inter­\nvene, but because there is no other way of proceeding when tech­\nnical development is present.\nTechnique always supposes centralization. When I use gas, or \nelectricity, or the telephone, it is no plain and simple mechanism \nwhich is at my disposal, but a centralized organization. A central \ntelephonic or electrical station gives substance to the whole electric \nnetwork and to every individual piece of apparatus. The technical \n“central* is the normal expression of every application. A coexist-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY19 -#)\nence of these centrals is implied: a completely centralized organi­\nzation which ultimately encompasses all human activities. Techni­\ncal centralization is one of the major realities of our time. The ques­\ntion is whether these centralized organs can exist independently of \none another. Can each develop in its own specific and autono­\nmous way? Jttnger, who poses this question, is correct in stressing \nthat the system is not hierarchical, that every technical body is in­\ndependent of its neighbor, and that there is no subordination among \nthem. Economically and politically, however, the risk is very great. \nEach of the centralized bodies must be put into its proper position \nand relation with respect to the others. This is a function of the \nplan, and only the state is in a position to supervise the whole com­\nplex and to co-ordinate these organisms in order to obtain a higher \ndegree of centralization.\nThe idea of effecting decentralization while maintaining techni­\ncal progress is purely utopian. For its own centralization, technique \nrequires interrelated economic and political centralization. And we \nare speaking here of mechanical technique alone, without going \ninto the motives of political technique.\nThe state, which by its very nature is the organ of centralization, \nis at the same time the organ of choice of the technical centraliza­\ntion. Anyone who believes statesmen are malevolent in willing cen­\ntralization demonstrates thereby only his own naivety. The state is \nforced to realize the plan for exclusively technical reasons.\nWe have already seen how the necessity of sanctions brings about \na relation between the plan and the state. This relation can also \nbe envisaged as the administrative framework of the state, which \nsupports the techniques of planning and assures them freedom of \noperation and a certain stability. I must insist on this last charac­\nteristic.\nThe techniques set up by the plan must envisage economic real­\nity and its probable development as faithfully as possible. In order \nto elaborate a plan, however, it is necessary to consider certain ele­\nments as stable and fixed, and not take all elements as simulta­\nneously variable. But there is no guarantee that these elements \nwill really be fixed. The same difficulty arises when it becomes sub­\nstantially impossible to forecast the development of some factor or \nother in economic life. In such a case, either a hypothetical evolu­\ntion of the factor will be posed, or the factor will be fixed arbi-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (195\ntrarily. This is a problem in a five-year plan and, much more \nacutely, in a plan of longer duration in which production must be \nprojected far into the future. An excellent example is the ground­\nwork for the electrification of France. Should it be based on steam \nplants or hydroelectric plants? To decide this, inquiry must be \nmade, among other factors, into the relative cost price of each sys­\ntem for a given amount of electrical power produced. These plants \nwould be designed to last for a long time; but how long? Let us \nsuppose the period to be the mean duration of a waterfall, a hun­\ndred years. The calculation would then proceed on this basis, \nsubject to three fundamental factors: the cost of the initial estab­\nlishment, the capitalization of the maintenance charges for a hun­\ndred years, and the cost of coal for a hundred years. The third of \nthese factors can be calculated roughly; but what of the second? \nIt depends on the interest rate, which cannot be predicted that far \nim advance. There is yet another factor: monetary developments. \nHow then can the plan be established? There is only one way: to re­\nquire state guarantees; to obtain from the political power the as­\nsurance that for the realization of the plan the interest rate of the \nloans will not vary.\nIt may be noted in passing (and this confirms our thesis of the \nunity of the technical phenomenon) that the improvement of sta­\ntistics makes it necessary for the state to intervene in economic \ntechnique: the publication of statistics may be of great utility to \nthe intelligence services of some eventual enemy. Stuart Arthur \nRice gives examples of statistics in foreign commerce which con­\ntributed to sabotage operations. Hence, the state must centralize all \nstatistics and either make available only statistics of interest to a \ngiven category of businessmen or manufacturers or keep completely \nsecret whatever might be of interest to the enemy. This surveil­\nlance was entrusted, in 1950, in the United States to the Bureau of \nthe Budget. It must be noted that American public opinion is not \ncontent with this compromise. It tolerates badly the “indecision” \nimposed by the cold war. However, a strong minority desires a total \nblackout of statistics, as in the Soviet Union. The state would then \nhave indirect, but nevertheless complete, control of economic ac­\ntivity, inasmuch as it alone would know the full economic situation.\nA bond is thus established between the state and the economy \nwhereby technical progress is not possible without the interven-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY196 )\ntion of the state. This does not mean that the whole economy is in \nthe hands of the state. We ought, on the whole, to abandon the idea \nof a ravaging and dictatorial state. Let us think only of the cold \nand impersonal mechanism that holds all sources of energy in its \nhands. What is production without energy? What is the economy? \nDoes not the agent that controls the supply of energy also direct the \neconomy? Technically speaking, the control of energy can no longer \nbe in the hands of any agent but the state. This is true even in \nthe United States, as has recently been shown.\nIf statistics are to be given their full scope, it is necessary to co­\nordinate the actions of different organisms to avoid useless repeti­\ntion, and also to pay the bill, since centers for statistical research \ndo not pay for themselves. When statistical data have been col­\nlected, what agency but the state is in a position to exploit them \nfully and make them yield their total practical value? It is scarcely \nnecessary to recall that the very different factors that result from \ntechnique (trusts, atomic energy, capital concentration, the hyper­\ntrophic enlargement of the means of production, and many more) \nall entail state action. The relation established by technical facts, \nwhich become the common denominator between state and econ­\nomy, is neither chance nor fleeting. There is no possibility of re­\nversing the movement, as certain idealistic anti-interventionists \nwould have us believe. Neither is there any hope, short of certain \nextraordinary transformations, that the conjunction of state and \neconomy is transitory, as the Communists would have us believe.\nCertainly, if production were to become sufficiently great, if the \nsystem of distribution were perfect (and, once fixed, were not sub­\nject to variation), and if, above all else, men were to become an­\ngels (an indispensable condition), the conjunction between state \nand economy might disappear. The same would be true if modern \ntechnique were to vanish. But it is advisable to think in more re­\nalistic terms.\nThe fact that the economy and the state are reciprocally joined \nis technically founded in such a way that the two tend to become \naspects of the same phenomenon, a phenomenon which, moreover, \nis not the the result of a simple accretion of previous phenomena. \nIt seems to me particularly important to emphasize this new charac­\nter. Because of the existence of techniques, we are beyond the \nproblems of ordinary £tatism or of socialism. It is not the simple\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 197\nphenomenon of the growth of power or the struggle against capi­\ntalism which is decisive here. We are witnessing the birth of a new \norganism, the technical state, which makes economic life more se­\ncure in proportion as it becomes more technical. It is no longer \neven possible to say: “It could be done otherwise.” In the abstract \nas well as in the concrete, all technical evidence attests to the con­\ntrary. What is involved is in fact the logical development of the \nnation-state.\nThis double relation (the state assuring the national life, and \nwhatever pertains to the nation converging toward the state) be­\ncomes more specific, stronger, and more rigid when technical \nelements come into play. What was mere tendency becomes frame­\nwork, what was talk becomes means, and the relation of adminis­\ntration to population becomes organization. And because the econ­\nomy is an aspect of the nation, it, too, comes into the system. The \nstate, too, changes its aspect on contact with technical elements. \nThe principal goals of the economy are at first modified, but its \nelements of pride and power, potentially always there, emerge sub­\nsequently in a more brutal way. Humble humanitarian motives are \nno longer important. Technique is too neutral and the state too \npowerful for either to encumber itself with such things. It is no \nlonger even a question of wealth or distribution; in the technical \nsynthesis, the economy becomes again the servant, when (after \nMarx) it had been thought the master.\nThe duel of politics and economics culminates in a synthesis in \nwhich politics disappears and economics is forced into submission. \nThis synthesis, to be sure, has not yet been fully realized. France, \none of the older nations, is not even completely conscious of what \nis happening. But the Soviet Union is already very close to this \nsynthesis, and the United States is being oriented in this direction \nvery rapidly as a result of the large-scale economic maneuvers \ninto which it is being forced. And, above all, new nations such as \nAustralia and New Zealand are spontaneously constructing this syn­\nthetic complex. How could Africa even hope to refashion its society \nrapidly (as its new independence requires) if it did not resolutely \nembrace technical synthesis? Nasser, Mohammed V, and Castro \nare all attempting precisely this.\nI remarked above that this is not socialism. With the disappear­\nance of humanitarian goals, socialism is rendered unfeasible by\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY1 9 8 )\nthe sheer weight of techniques. The ownership of the means of \nproduction ceases to be the central problem. Social equality be­\ncomes a myth as a result of the emergence of an aristocracy of \ntechnicians; and the proletariat is necessarily extended (to no \none’s dissatisfaction), instead of disappearing. Certain elements of \nsocialism continue to exist; for example, social security, the redis­\ntribution of the national income, and the suppression of individual \nprofit. But they exist as isolated fragments, and not as a system. It \nis not even certain that these elements will be found in all the syn­\ntheses now being created. Their continued existence depends on \nwhether they are judged to be efficient. They cannot escape this \njudgment. An excellent example of fragmentary socialism, based on \nanything but socialistic motives, is given by Fourastie. He demon­\nstrates (correctly, I believe) that capital decreases in importance \nin proportion as technique increases in importance. “In a period of \ntechnical progress, the wage value of capital tends toward zero, \nwhereas the physical product of capital constantly increases.\" \nClearly, it is not a question of the absolute value of capital. Yet the \ncapitalist sees his assets lose value in direct proportion to the de­\nvelopment of technical progress. I shall not repeat Fourastie s rea­\nsoning— it seems to me convincing. His conclusion, moreover, is \nof the first importance: that the center of the economic problem is \nshifting. The legal question of ownership is no longer important \nThe debate no longer concerns who owns the means of produc­\ntion, or who will take the profits. The crux of the economic problem \nhas moved to the extreme point of technical development. The real \ndebate concerns who will be in a position to support, absorb, and \nintegrate technical progress and to furnish optimal conditions for \nits development\nIt is contrary to the nature of technique to be compatible with \nanarchy in any sense of the word. When milieu and action become \ntechnical, order and organization are imposed. The state itself, pro­\njected into the technical movement, becomes its agent Technique \nis, therefore, the most important factor in the destruction of capi­\ntalism, much more so than the revolt of the masses. Human revolt \ncan only accompany the destruction of capitalism and philosophize \nabout it. As to socialism, the final result is still indiscernible and no \nprediction, except of a negative nature, is possible.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (199\nEconomic centralization has been criticized on humane grounds. \nJean Francis Gravier has attacked the movement on purely techni­\ncal grounds and has attempted to show that decentralization (at \nleast of the population) is necessary if society is to remain in equi­\nlibrium. His thesis is as follows: Technique permits the diffusion of \nthe population over a wide area with as well developed economic \npotentialities as the great cities. Diffusion would not be subject to \npresent health hazards, oppressive costs to communities ( a resident \nof Paris costs the state five times as much as a resident of Vendee), \nand so on. This thesis, then, is based on new technical development. \nBut there are three objections: First, decentralization is not possible \nunless there is a powerful planned organization for decentraliza­\ntion. Such an organization usually operates on the level of the in­\ndividual, not of the economic organism. Second, population diffu­\nsion could lead to an urbanization of the countryside rather than \nto a true diffusion of the population into a rural milieu. Third, the \nthesis represents a mere theoretical possibility and not a necessary \nmovement.\nIt must be admitted that actual experience seems to contradict \nthe thesis. Since 1955 a serious and concerted movement has been \nunder way to decentralize Paris and its industrial complex. The re­\nsult so far is that six hundred industrial plants have left the area. \nBut only four thousand wage earners have been resettled in the \nprovinces, whereas, when the plants in question achieve full op­\neration, they will employ seventy-five thousand wage earners re­\ncruited locally. Moreover, half of these six hundred plants have \nbeen settled in the vicinity of Paris. During the five-year period in \nquestion, fifty thousand new jobs have been created each year in \nParis alone and the population of the city has risen by nearly a \nmillion.\nDecentralization, then, has experienced a radical setback. Econo­\nmists who have analyzed this setback conclude that in order to de­\ncentralize industrially it is necessary to effect total decentralization, \nincluding administrative, financial, and cultural decentralization. \nTotal action, however, would be difficult to achieve; precise and \nadequate technical motives for it do not exist Furthermore, it \nwould have to be implemented by authoritarian measures. The \nstate would have to act to constrain the citizens with authoritarian\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY200 )\npenalties corresponding to authoritarian decisions. It is easily seen \nthat the proposed decentralization would have to rest upon a ma­\njor aggrandizement of centralized authority.\nThe Authoritarian Economy. An economy completely founded on \ntechnique cannot be a liberal economy. (This is not entirely the \nsame as the preceding idea.) Technique is, in reality, opposed to \nliberalism, a social form which is unable to absorb and utilize \nmodern techniques. It seems clear that economic liberalism is not \nin itself a technique. In fact, the attitude represented by laissez- \nfaire, however much mitigated it may have become, is a renuncia­\ntion of the use of techniques; techniques suppose conscious human \naction, not abstention from action.\nWhen liberalism requires men to put their trust in the obscure \nalchemy of certain natural \"laws,” it in effect restrains them from \nmaking use of the technical means at their disposal. These means \npermit men to intervene in the order of nature, to adjust its \"laws” \nto their purposes, and to exploit them, as in the physical order. They \nalso permit intervention that would appear to contradict natural \nlaws and modify the order of nature. It is clear, then, that they are \nnot really \"laws” at all. In view of this, technique does not accord \nthese nonexistent laws the respect recommended by liberalism. \nTherefore, when technique develops, both the liberal attitude and \nits doctrine become impossible. I have posed the problem at its \nmost acute by placing it at the point of contact between liberalism \nand the economic techniques of intervention (which are the very \nnegation of liberalism). But my thesis is just as true for the simple \ntechniques of production which influence the economy. As I have \nalready shown, every mechanical technique supposes a correspond­\ning organization. And organization is the diametrical opposite of \nfree enterprise; and the organizational state of mind is the diametri­\ncal opposite of the liberal state of mind.\nIt will doubtless be pointed out, by way of refutation, that pro­\nduction techniques were developed during the ascendancy of lib­\neralism, which furnished a favorable climate for their development \nand understood perfectly how to use them. But this is no counter­\nargument. The simple fact is that liberalism permitted the develop­\nment of its executioner, exactly as in a healthy tissue a constituent \ncell may proliferate and give rise to a fatal cancer. The healthy \nbody represented the necessary condition for the cancer. But there\n\f\nThe Technological Society (201\nwas no contradiction between the two. The same relation holds be­\ntween technique and economic liberalism.\nHere, then, is the locus of the conflict between technique and \nthe liberal economy, which Jiinger, among others, has studied. \nTechnique is inevitably opposed to the liberal economy because the \nend of technique is efficiency and rationality, and the end of lib­\neralism is money profit. Technique requires of the liberal econ­\nomy nonprofitable decisions and risks. For example, when expen­\nsive new machines are developed before the old ones have been \namortized, the industrialist is forced to liquidate the old machines \nor he runs the risk of being eliminated from the market. This con­\nflict holds good on all levels.\nWhen the state controls the economy, it faces similar problems. \nBut such problems affect every economy. In this perspective, plan­\nning is criticized as wasteful. Yet the very criticism shows that the \nliberal mentality is still in force.\nEven in a capitalist context, however, judgments concerning \nwastefulness are modified with time and according to the sector. \nIn a report, the ILO has compared ordinary mechanization with \nthe mechanization of offices: “The mechanization of labor in offices \nwill often, against standard practice, be considered justified from \nthe viewpoint of profits, even if it increases the expenses of the \noffice. This is the case when mechanization increases the yield of \nthe productive unit of which the office forms the administrative sec­\ntion” (Mas). But even taking into consideration such partial ex­\nceptions, it remains true that conflict between technique and the \nliberal economy is inevitable because the liberal economy is essen­\ntially based on profit. It does not exist without profit. To a planned \neconomy, however, profit is not the highest value. Certainly, the \nplanned economy does not neglect the profit motive completely, \nbut profit represents only one element in its calculations. The prin­\ncipal criterion of the planned economy is rationality (or effi­\nciency): in a word, technique.\nIn the conflict between technique and the liberal economy, tech­\nnique, then, is victorious over the liberal economy and bends it to \nits laws. The process is furthered, as I have shown, by the fact that \nthe liberal economy, insofar as it is thought out, itself becomes \ntechnique. The unity between economy and technique is thus re­\nstored, but liberalism is eliminated. Economists may seek to justify\n\f\ntechnique and economyao2)\nthis by speaking of “public service” or the “common good,” but \nsuch talk represents no more than a justification a posteriori, an \nideological smoke screen. It is, as such, not without value, but it is \nnot comparable in importance with the major fact of technical in­\nvasion.\nLiberalism is softened and progressively eclipsed in direct pro­\nportion to the growth and imposition of techniques. The relation \nbetween the degradation of liberalism and the development of \nthese techniques is unavoidable. The oft-heard assertion that lib­\neralism is capable of production but incapable of distribution rep­\nresents the broadest view of the matter. How is it that liberalism is \ncapable of producing? The answer is that, in free enterprise, pro­\nduction is not a part of the liberal framework. It is, rather, subject \nto extensive planning, and it could not well be otherwise. What is \nspecifically liberal is the passage of consumer goods and their dis­\ntribution in the various consumer sectors; and it is precisely the dis­\ntributive process which works so poorly and which is constantly be­\ning hampered, since technique throws such enormous unmeasured \nquantities of ill-considered products onto the market\nThe same is true of the tendency toward monopolies and trusts. \nIn all sectors of the economy, this tendency is the plague and the \ndestruction of liberalism. It ends either in a straightforward mo­\nnopoly with no competitive' freedom (whether the monopoly is pri­\nvate or of the state, the result of the contest between state control \nand liberalism is the same), o r  monopolistic competition, which is \nno less ruinous than outright monopoly because of the waste it \ncauses. It is technique alone, in two different aspects, which gives \nrise to these facts. First, financial techniques are encouraged, which \npermit the establishment of institutions such as trusts and concerns \n(this would be unthinkable without a prodigious development of \nmeans) and assure the flexibility of these institutions on the level \nof banks and stock exchanges. Second, competition is encouraged, \nwhich, when it becomes established among several enterprises un­\nder a liberal regime, is in reality a competition of techniques in \nthe microeconomic phase. To the extent that techniques remain \nstatic, different enterprises are able to exist side by side, each with \nits own clientele for its own products. Some of the enterprises may \nbe powerful and some weak, but the weak ones are nonetheless \nstill able to subsist. It is not magnitude of enterprise which destroys\n\f\nThe Technological Society (203\nthe equilibrium, but technical progress. The moment an enterprise \napplies new procedures (for example, new public-relations tech­\nniques, machines that increase yield and decrease unit cost, busi­\nness organization that makes labor more efficient, financial modali­\nties that assure greater stability), it finds that these technical \nelements give it an advantage over its competitors and allow it to \neliminate or absorb them.\nCompetition is thus an incitement to such technical progress as \nwill bring victory over the competitor. This means that competition \ntends to destroy liberalism. It will be objected that competition does \nnot destroy the liberal economy completely because all the com­\npetitors will adopt technical development. (In practice, certain sec­\ntors of the economy are completely monopolistic.) In reply to the \nobjection, I reiterate that technique engenders itself and that any­\none who succeeds in making a headstart in the technical domain in­\ncreases his advantage without limit.\nFor these reasons I am unable to agree completely with Vincent’s \nposition. For Vincent, as for me, technique and liberalism are in­\ncompatible. But, it seems, his reasoning does not take account of \nall the facts. Vincent’s thesis can be summarized as follows: “How \nwill the advantages of technical progress be divided in a pure lib­\neral regime, supposing perfect competition and nonintervention of \nthe state? It is clear that in this hypothetical case the producers who \nhave achieved technical progress would not be able to benefit \nfrom it, since, by hypothesis, competitors will arise to bring sales \nprice to the level of decreased cost price.” We conclude that only \nthe consumer would be in a position to benefit from technical prog­\nress. This implies an unexpected conclusion: since progress would \nbring no special advantage, no one could be expected to want or \nseek it  The affirmation is inescapable that pure liberalism in es­\nsence compels stagnation.\nThis way of putting the problem is rather hypothetical and ab­\nstract. Vincent himself admits it. But, even so, the reasoning is not \nconvincing in itself. It is too easy to reply (and the liberals will \nnot fail to do so) that the application of such simon-pure liberalism \nhas never been an issue. What is important to liberals is a liberalism \nadapted to economic conditions and then stabilized. This liberal­\nism would permit technical progress.\nVincents arguments are convincing only in regard to one side of"

    "raw_text": "TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY*04)\nthe following dilemma: either liberalism remains true to itself, and \nis forced to challenge technical progress according to the arguments \ngiven above; or it adopts technical progress, and is obliged to repu­\ndiate itself. But the first alternative, that is, to stabilize the limita­\ntions on liberalism, is impossible. The second alternative will be \nthe actual issue. The more technical progress advances, the more \nconstricted'will be the role of liberalism.\nCould we not pass between the horns of the dilemma by means \nof the less and less likely possibility of competition? Just as techni­\ncal progress never attains the absolute, so freedom of competition \nwill doubtless never disappear absolutely. But there is a point at \nwhich it is no longer possible to speak of liberalism. In the most \nauthoritarian regime, some freedom remains. It is nonetheless an \nauthoritarian regime. The perspective changes depending on the \ntime and the psychology; the point at which we stop saying “lib­\neralism” and say “controlled economy\" also varies. But the process \ncannot be checked. No personal choice is possible. Certainly, it is \nnot that a strict automatism comes into play. To clinch the system \nand complete the process, human decision and intervention are nec­\nessary.\nIt might nevertheless be objected that economic laws have ex­\nistence insofar as they are understood— that a choice is possible be­\ntween technical intervention and a return to the free operation of \neconomic laws. Unfortunately, illusions and hopes are more tena­\ncious than realistic considerations. When technical progress inter­\nvenes, it modifies not only the application of economic laws but \nalso the essence of the laws. We may consider this in two ways. \nFirst, economic laws are not eternal like the laws received by \nMoses on M t Sinai. Our economic laws are valid only for a certain \ntype or form of economy. When technical progress occurs, it is \nintegrated into the economic system not as a foreign element but \norganically. Technical progress is a part of the essence of an eco­\nnomic system, not a mere accidental event. When some chemical \nsubstance changes the metabolism of a body, the result is a new \nsituation which follows certain laws that did not hold for the pre­\nceding situations. The chemist studies a new combination from \nwhich he must extract new laws. When the facts change, the con­\nstants, as well as the laws, are modified.\nSecond, even if we insist on making value judgments, on declar-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (205\ning a certain state to be normal and the laws that control it alone \nto be just, if, in other words, we want economic laws to be as \nrigorous and eternal as the laws of physics, the situation does not \nchange. The laws of physics are known to be relative; the laws of \nmicrophysics in force today are not the laws we learned from our \nschoolbooks. The situation is exactly the same in economics. A \nchange of scale is not merely a change of magnitude; it is a modifi­\ncation of nature. In fact, technique has modified the scale of human \neconomy, and the laws that held for the average economic system \nat the beginning of the nineteenth century no longer apply in the \nnew scale of the economy we know today. Liberalism is only con­\nceivable if technical progress is choked off so that the system re­\nmains at a fixed stage of equilibrium and of middling force.\nThe antinomy between liberalism and technique is further ac­\ncentuated when we consider that technique can give rise to noth­\ning but a mass economy. We refer here not only to the fact that the \nexpanding and developing economy embraces an ever increasing \nnumber of human individuals and that demographic growth re­\nquires such an expansion. Here we are not using the word num in \nthe sense of great numbers, but in the usual sociological sense of \nmass opposed to community. It is recognized that our civilization is \nbecoming a mass civilization. But we generally neglect the twofold \nfact that technique is one of the important factors of this “massifica- \ntion” and that the economy takes from it a particular form. Tech­\nnique makes the economy a mass economy, that is to say, the econ­\nomy taken as a whole to which we give the name macroeconomy. \n(This hypothesis is necessary in order to account for the free play \nof economic techniques.) Economic problems must be posed in \nglobal terms, in terms of global income, global employment, global \ndemand, and so on. This global, macroeconomic conception cor­\nresponds to mass society, which is extremely differentiated, as we \nknow. Just as technique breaks down the barriers between eco­\nnomic sectors, so an economy based on technique tends to burst \nasunder the traditional sociological frameworks.\nThe macroeconomy is only a framework and an element of an \neconomic technique. It is indifferent to free enterprise and to the \nconcept of the nation, which it destroys, not voluntarily but indi­\nrectly. It has no personal, private goal. It does not seek at all to \nmodify a given social or economic reality. Nevertheless, the break-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY206)\ndown of all the traditional particularisms occurs in economics (as I \nhave already described). The result of the macroeconomic method, \nto the degree that it proves itself efficient, will be to smoothe out \neconomic contradictions and to encompass within the artificial what \npreviously belonged to the natural. To the degree that macroeco­\nnomics brings us to think in global and statistical terms, it leads to \nthe suppression of the causes of fractionation, for example, na­\ntional frontiers.\nThe macroeconomic movement toward universalism will be \nstronger the more it is reinforced by other, convergent factors. The \nfirst step is the constitution of an intercontinental economy (which \ntechnique, in any case, renders inevitable for other reasons). The \nmovement toward an intercontinental economy leads to a mass \neconomy.\nA second characteristic of this \"massification” is summarized in \nSartre’s profound remark that “statistics can never be dialectics.” \nThere is an opposition (even a mutual exclusion) between statistics \nand dialectics. They differ not merely in their mode of explaining \nbut also in their very mode of apprehending the world and action. \nStatistics is necessarily a univocal method that expresses an aspect \nof reality which is uncombinable with any other (except other sta­\ntistics ) and which cannot tolerate contradiction or evolutionary de­\nvelopment Statistics conceives evolution only in its formal aspect, \nfastening on its strictly numerical element and proceeding dis­\ncretely along the number continuum which it connects by extrapo­\nlation. It sets up this linear formulation as the very essence of evolu­\ntion. But it is incapable of grasping in any degree the internal and \ncontinuous mechanism of evolution and the interplay of negations \ninvolved in the affirmations. Statistics (and every technique) can \nproceed only by affirmation, by exclusion of negations, refusal, and \ndestruction. It implies and prescribes a logical evolution, but not \na dialectic evolution. An economics founded on this method is of \nnecessity antidialectical; it is one of the profound betrayals of \nMarxism on the part of modem Communism.\nThe movement of masses is likewise univocal and antidialectical. \n(The interested reader is referred to Reiwald’s L’Esprit des \nmasses.) There is therefore a fixed connection between statistics \nand the economics of mass society. But only opposition exists be­\ntween statistics and organic society: the life of an organic, dialectic\n\f\nThe Technological Society (207\nsociety cannot be completely enclosed in a technical operation like \nstatistics. Statistics even implies a mass society. Economically, this \ntechnical operation presupposes that all members of society partici­\npate, privately and without concern for the whole, in the economic \nsystem that techniques progressively elaborate. It is not only that \neveryone is inescapably a consumer and producer and as such par­\nticipates in economic life. More important, all members of society \n(not each member) are integrated in the mass into a pre-established \nsystem. It is the facts of “all” and “pre-established,” required by the \nuse of technique, which involve the mass.\nThe “all” is involved because technique yields results and de­\nmands effort to such a degree that no individual can remain out­\nside. But if technique demands the participation of everybody, this \nmeans that the individual is reduced to a few essential functions \nwhich make him a mass maa He remains “free,” but he ,can no \nlonger escape being a part of the mass. Technical expansion re­\nquires the widest possible domain. In the near future not even the \nwhole earth may be sufficient.\nThe “pre-established” is involved because technique has its laws \nand its motives (which I have already outlined) and fashions the \nframeworks that are most auspicious to it We are experiencing this \nin the modern world. Despite the preoccupations of humanist \neconomists, the economic mechanism tends to become stricter, ad­\nhering to reality through its technique but, at the same time, ab­\nsorbing it Men must enter into a pre-established framework. Tech­\nnique cannot act otherwise than to “pre-establish” them too; if it \ndid not act so, it would not even exist itself.\nWe now see why the social complex, on contact with technique, \nbecomes mass, rather than a community or an organism. Technique \ndemands for its development malleable human ensembles. We \nhave already encountered this characteristic in our discussion of \ntechnical expansion, and we find it again (in a very typical way) in \nour study of the influence of technique on the economy. The econ­\nomy, oriented in this direction, supposes mobile masses of men \navailable to needs which are simultaneously economic and tech­\nnical.\nEvery undertaking involving a real community is necessarily anti- \ntechnical on the economic level, not only because it is relatively \nstatic but because of its particularism. If genuine communities were\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY208  )\nto develop, no further economic technique would be possible. I am, \nof course, speaking here of true communities, not of counterfeit \ncommunities such as the corporations have represented since 1935. \nWe conclude, then, that the social form most auspicious to economic \ntechnique is the mass. In this form, the calculus of probabilities and \nplanning both have free play.\nThe Antidemocratic Economy. All this being so, we touch upon \na new characteristic of economic technique: it is inevitably anti-, \ndemocratic. At first glance, this comment sounds surprising, even \nshocking. After all, technique does bring the masses of men into the \neconomic circuit, allowing them to participate in it as they never \ndid before. In the technical affirmation of the present, we can point \nto the fact that we are witnessing the forward movement of social­\nism: management committees, autonomous administration of social \nsecurity, profit sharing, workers’ councils (which exist not only in \nthe Soviet Union), and the achievement of recognized status by the \nlabor unions, which thus can play a positive (not merely a revolu­\ntionary) role.\nHow, under these circumstances, is it possible to speak of the \ntechnical economy as antidemocratic? In reply, it would be easy to \nshow that all these different kinds of \"progress” become feasible \nonly to the degree that men are subjected in advance to the action \nof technique. The opposition men manifest to this slavery (and it \nis a kind of slavery) is merely superficial, a matter of self-interest, \nand is not due to any basic revolutionary orientation. Men are un­\nable to exert genuine influence on the direction of the economy. \nThey can change certain modalities of wages. They can alter the \ndirection of enterprise and intervene in certain economic forms to \ncompensate for certain mechanical drawbacks; and they can give \nopinions on fabrication, procedures, and financial methods. None \nof these is negligible and I have no desire to minimize their impor­\ntance. But they do not add up to economic democracy.\nCollective ownership of the means of production (from the point \nof view of nationalization, collectivization, or state socialism) is an \nabstraction, an even greater abstraction than political democracy. \nW e well know to what degree of abstraction political democracy \nhas been pushed and how little the vote of the citizens actually \ncounts despite all the talk about “popular sovereignty.” The means\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2 0  9\nof production are said to be the property of the people. But can the \npeople do with them what they wish? Can they actually nominate \ntheir leaders? These are the real questions. If the people directly \nconcerned in some business affair (for example, the workers in an \nindustrial plant) were to decide to exploit the plant in some other \nway, or not to exploit it at all, or even to destroy the machinery, \nwould anyone listen to them? If no one listened, under the pretext \nthat the decisions in question were senseless, the real reason would \nbe that there are criteria superior to the popular will according to \nwhich popular will is judged. Popular will can only express itself \nwithin the limits that technical necessities have fixed in advance. \nCan the people select engineers? Or accountants, or organizers? \nCan they pass judgment about methods of work? If they could, it \nwould amount to the system (which has actually been attempted) \nin which judges are elected by the governed, tax collectors by the \ntaxpayers, generals by the privates. Such a system would represent \nthe only truly democratic method. Why is the democratic method \nnot applied in the areas cited, whereas we do elect politicians. For \nthe simple reason that the functions of judge, general, and engineer \nare considered to be functions of technicians, but the politician is \ndeemed to be a nontechnical functionary: good for everything, \ngood for nothing.\nThe Russian and French Revolutions introduced popular elec­\ntion of judges and generals: this was consistent with their con­\ncept of democracy. But the results were so disastrous that it was \nsoon necessary to repeal this procedure.\nTechnique is the boundary of democracy. What technique wins, \ndemocracy loses. If we had engineers who were popular with the \nworkers, they would be ignorant of machinery. In our time, tech­\nnique is the court of last appeal. The worker is master neither of \nhis factory nor of his bosses.\nThe democracy of popular “control” is purely formal. The situa­\ntion in this respect is the same in all representative democracies in \nwhich all things technical are taken out of the control of the elec­\ntors, who must thenceforth repose their faith in an ideology of \npolitical function superior to all others and encompassing every \nhuman activity. By its intermediacy, the elector would still be \nmaster of his destiny. Unfortunately, when the politician intervenes\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY2 1 0 )\nto advance the cause of his constituents, he succeeds only in dis­\nturbing the proper functioning of technique, in making everyone \ndiscontented, and ultimately in losing his powers.\nAre we, then, to believe today that by some secret alchemy the \nworkers, who hold title to a purely abstract property, really inter­\nvene in the economic game? Were it really so, it could only be on \ncondition that they had to do with an extraordinarily flexible, not \nto say slovenly, economy. It would certainly be nontechnical. If \nsuch an economy were even conceivable, it would be a noncapital­\nist liberalism, that is to say, anarchy.\nWhen the economy becomes exact and technical, it cannot toler­\nate the intervention of the working man’s desires. Certainly, there is \nsuch a thing as benevolent and rational regulation of labor, human \nindustrial relations, hygiene, and so forth. But this is the internal \nregulation that a good technique supposes and requires. The only \npossibility of obtaining a high, continuous, and profitable produc­\ntivity is by taking adequate account not only of immediate, bare \nyield but also of the conservation of human material, which also \nrepresents a kind of capital. At present the working man’s wishes \nhappen to coincide well with the imperatives of a rather exact and \nprofound technique. This is the only reason his wishes are taken \ninto account. The real function, then, of the worker’s desires is to \nadvance and improve technique, and not at all to enhance his free­\ndom. This fact has a political parallel: in elections under authori­\ntarian regimes, ballots may be cast only for the regime. Although \nthe authority of the government is thereby increased, the elector \ndraws material advantages from his vote, for the government, \nofficially relying on the people, will commit itself to great efforts in \ntheir behalf.\nThere can be no doubt that this kind of democratization leads to \na certain improvement in the lot of the people. But it is an improve­\nment brought about not by the people themselves, who are mere \nservitors, but by technique, to the degree and according to the con­\nception of life dictated by technique.\nIt is possible to envisage the democratic effect of technique in \nanother perspective, that of consumption. It is currently argued \nthat technique eliminates social privileges and suppresses pre­\nexisting social distinctions (although we must recognize that it \nestablishes certain others in their stead). The Italian economist\n\f\nThe Technological Society (211\nBertolino gives a good example of this argument in his study of \nstandardization. Standardization produces certain democratic ef­\nfects, according to this economist, for two reasons. First, it reduces \nprices; consequently consumption is increased, welfare is more \nwidely distributed, and living standards are equalized. Second, it \nreduces the types of available merchandise; there is less diversity \non the market and choice is limited. These two factors tend toward \ndemocratic equalization. The search for what is “distinctive,” which \nis based on a diversity of economic powers, is rendered impossible. \nHence, technique should operate in the direction of democracy.\nThis argument represents exactly the same attitude as that of a \nHenry Ford driven by democratic sentiment to mass-produce auto­\nmobiles so that everyone might benefit from this luxury article. \nBut the mass production of automobiles required the employment \nof tens of thousands of workers on the assembly line. Bertolino \npasses very lightly over the disadvantages thus occasioned, but \nwe must pay close attention to them. For example, there is the \ndanger of unemployment. In case of substantial unemployment, \nthere is no increase in the public welfare even though prices de­\ncline. Bertolino's argument does not seem to me to be decisive.\nNo more decisive is the argument that technique produces social \nequality. To argue, as Mumford does, that social equality exists be­\ncause the poor man’s electric light is identical with the rich man’s, \nwhereas in the middle ages an enormous difference existed be­\ntween a pitch pine torch and a luxurious candle, is to risk proving \nthe exact opposite of what was intended. The life of the lord of the \nmanor was in many ways closer to that of a serf than the life of a \nmodem industrialist is to that of a worker. The serf and the lord \nshared the same nourishment and the same discomfort. There is \ncertainly at least as much difference between the poor man’s \ncheap radio and the rich man’s Telefunken, or between a motor \nscooter and a Chrysler, as between the pine torch and the candle. \nWe could adduce an endless number of such comparisons.\nThe question may be asked; what is the price we must pay for \nStandardization? Bertolino indicates this price very clearly. In \nthe first place, it is essential that cost reduction not be expressed in \nwage reduction or unemployment. The state must intervene to see \nto this. In the second place, cost reduction must be translated into \nreduction in sales price. The state must enforce obligatory redue-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOM Ytit)\ntions in sales prices. In the third place, standardization must be \napplied in its totality; it must not be merely of limited effect. It \nmust be applied to a whole industry, and if the industry is suffi­\nciently important this will inevitably lead to the standardization of \nrelated and complementary industries. Here again the state must \nintervene with either persuasive or coercive measures.\nIt is already clear that standardization, as a “democratic’*  effect, \nimplies extremely authoritative state action, extensive controls, a \nmore and more forced centralization, and a pronouncedly undemo­\ncratic state of mind. Moreover, one cannot fail to be somewhat sur­\nprised to leam that the reduction of “types” is a democratic process. \nBertolino says that this reduction leads sometimes to a single type \nand, one must suppose, the consequent nullification of choice. But \nuntil now it has seemed that the very essence of democracy was \nprecisely the choice among several solutions, several types, several \ndoctrines, and that, moreover, this choice was left freely to the \npeople. The exercise of democracy was the exercise of choice. \nWhere there is no longer any choice, dictatorship exists.\nBut we must analyze this notion of choice further. We often say; \n“It is not democratic that certain persons are excluded by poverty \nfrom certain blessings, which deprives them of any possibility of \nchoice. If we extend well-being by standardization, we will im­\nprove the democratic conditions of the poor.” Unfortunately, this \nis not the case. If we admit the fact ( which is certainly true) that \nthe absence of choice occasioned by poverty is antidemocratic, it is \nnot by removing the more or less great freedom of choice— which \nthe majority still possess— that we will have democracy. In all coun­\ntries the majority still have some choice, and to take this away from \nthem is to consecrate the opposite of democracy. Bertolino is aware \nof this: he attempts to compensate for his risky assertion in two \nways. First, he tells us that standardization must be accompanied \nby inquiry into human tastes and desires, a procedure which will \nreintroduce personal choice within standardization, so to speak. \nThe proposal appears to be completely utopian. Standardization \nimplies a certain investment of funds over long periods. But, clearly, \nthese investments will never be seriously questioned just because \nthe public taste changes. Furthermore, technical development fol­\nlows its own proper laws, not the tastes of the public. It was not the \npublic which demanded air travel and television. Technical prog-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( a 13\nress created these things, and they were technically diffused and \nimposed on the public. The mechanism of standardization is identi­\ncal with that of every technique.\nSecond, Bertolino supposes standardization to be democratic in­\nsofar as it represents the conviction of the individuals who accept \nit. It is not sufficient that it be egalitarian in fact, It must be accom­\npanied by the popular consciousness that an egalitarian situation \nand a more complete equality are being realized through its agency \nand that the people are thus making progress toward a social de­\nmocracy. If a regime is sanctioned by the people, it can indeed be \nmaintained that it is democratic. But, of course, that is precisely \nwhat Hitler said of his regime. We must not lose sight of the fact \nthat today popular support can be secured with great ease by \nmeans of certain precise techniques. But this point does not matter \nmuch here. What is important is the fact that Bertolino’s desire to \nshow at any price that technique is democratic leads to a strange \nconception of democracy. We may best illustrate this by means of \ntwo quotations: “Democracy is the adhesion of each citizen individ­\nually to the opinion of the majority. This majority opinion becomes \nan irrefragable and indisputable fine of conduct. The individual \nis duty bound to look upon the line (economic or political) dictated \nby the majority as the best for society. The individual becomes \ndemocratic in this way. . . .\" “Democracy consists in the practice \nof regarding and using certain goods in a common way. Democracy \nsupposes that the individual transcends himself in order to realize \nsocial values with the others, and in the same way as the others.'*\nThese textual citations recall some strange speeches we have \nheard. The transition of the majority to a condition of unanimity \nthrough the adhesion of the individual, who renounces his in­\ndividuality to meld with the collectivity, is precisely the transition \nfrom democracy to dictatorship. It is true that standardization \ndemands this kind of democracy and that it could not be reconciled \nwith any other democratic form. But democracy in this case is \nonly a name superimposed on the reality of dictatorship. Whatever \naspects of economic technique we examine, we always find this \nopposition between technique and democracy.\nThe conflict between technique and democracy appears clearly \nin Soviet planning. The Soviets maintain that the Five-Year Plan \n(in its second phase) moves from the base to the summit, and that\n\f\n2 1 4  )  TECHNIQUE AMD ECONOMY\nthe decision of the base is decisive. However, the following ques­\ntion cannot be avoided: since technicians establish both norms and \ndetails, how is it possible to reconcile production directives, which \noriginate at the summit, with the desires of the workers’ cells at \nthe base? Soviet studies maintain that this antinomy can be re- \n•solved by so-called “production conferences.” But what we wit­\nness in fact is a technical centralization of wages and norms. Par­\nticularly instructive and worthy of note is the history of the plan \nof 1955. Khrushchev, in denouncing the errors of Stalin, declared \nthat until then planning had been \"bureaucratic,” “authoritarian,” \n“based on mere statistics”— and, moreover, that the plan of 1950 \nhad been fulfilled by only 30 per cent of enterprises. He said that it \nwas necessary to democratize the plan because the “active partici­\npation of the workers was indispensable. . . .” What, in fact, has \nbeen the result of Khrushchev’s good intentions? (1) The workers \nhave been given latitude to increase the goals set by the plan, but \nnot to decrease them; (2) the workers have had freedom to study \nways and means to obtain maximum productivity; (3) a propa­\nganda campaign for increasing productivity has been launched \nwhich has turned out to be the most intensive since the original \nintroduction of five-year plans. In this campaign the slogan is re­\npeated ceaselessly: “The State Plan is the law for every enterprise.” \nDemocratic freedom is clearly discernible in all this!\nThe decisive point in the development of these “production con­\nferences” is the necessity of technical progress, which may not be \nheld back by the desires of the workers.3  A workers’ committee can­\nnot regulate the complexity of technical problems. Moreover, a \nview of the whole (which the worker certainly cannot have) is \nnecessary in order to unify wages and norms on the plane of the \nmacroeconomy. Without this, social inequality and economic dis- \nequilibration would be inevitable. Along the same line, a stringent \ncontrol of production tempos and distribution of revenues is man­\ndatory— whatever the efficiency of the plan.\nAll this leads, both for the elaboration of the plan and for its \nexecution, to the primacy of technical demands imposed authorita­\ntively on all democratic orientations. All that is demanded of the \nman who carries out the plan is that he adapt himself to its norms\nSee Kerblay’j  Let Normes dam Fdconomk lovktique.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (215\nand that he find a stimulus to his productivity in the overfulfill­\nment of these norms. All that can be conceded to him is sufficient \ntime to adapt himself to the norms. To save face, there is endless \ntalk about psychological climate, environment, and socialist rivalry. \n(We shall study this point in detail in the last chapter.) It suffices, \nfor the present, to make the following comparison: a soldier who \ntakes part in an attack because he is forced to do so and a soldier \nwho is moved by patriotic enthusiasm do not share the same psy­\nchological climate. But both bring themselves to kill in the same \nway. As far as efficiency and collective results are concerned, psy­\nchological methods have been discovered and elaborated which \ngive the first soldier a belligerence equivalent to the patriotic ardor \nof the second. Democracy has nothing to do with the matter.\nDemocracy did not enter either into the theorem (conceded by \nthe majority of economists) that full employment, which is neces­\nsary to the sound development of economic technique, demands an \nauthoritarian method of worker placement. As Fourastie indicates, \ntechnique implies a transformation that makes “production due to \nhuman labor the very foundation of social progress; so that no social \nprogress can occur without transference of the working popula­\ntion.” But where is the democratic element in displacing the \nhuman being from his familiar surroundings, separating him from \nhis traditions and from his human and geographic milieu? I know \nthat the uprooting of human beings counts for little in respect to \neconomic law and that where economic necessity exists (for ex­\nample, in the struggle against unemployment) all other human \nneeds are unimportant and must vanish. I am, moreover, cognizant \nof the seeming truth that where there is nothing to eat there is no \nlonger a stable milieu. This new version of the primum vivere in a \nmaterialist form is only an apparent truth. But even if it were \ntrue, we would have to say then that the human being is con­\nstrained by economic necessity, and this is the exact opposite of \ndemocracy.\nThis method presupposes the destruction of our social structures \nand, in reality, deprives a civilization of any chance to give itself \nform. The primary element in any civilization is a stable relation \nbetween man and his environment. When man becomes the play­\nthing of abstract decisions, a civilization can no longer be created. \nHere we have, on the economic plane, the same effect of technique\n\f\n21  6 ) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY\nwhich we previously studied in a more general way. Man indeed \nparticipates in the economy, but technique causes him to participate \nnot as a man but as a thing.\nIt is in the realm of economic technique that we experience most \nclearly the great and dramatic process of modem times, in which \nboth chance and natural laws are transformed into decisions of \naccountants, rules of planning, and decrees of the state. It is exactly \nat this point that technique begins to be concerned with natural \nfact— with the fact of total human behavior, with man’s spontane­\nous obedience to so-called sociological currents, with his conformity \nto certain general types, with his responses (almost everywhere the \nsame) to given stimuli. Whether the question is one of understand­\ning public opinion, or of stochastics, or of statistics as a whole, the \ntechnical starting point is always the human behavior of the major­\nity. From this behavior, technique draws a number of consequences \nand modes of action, erecting on it the system into which it will \nnecessarily insert itself. Moreover, it makes this behavior obliga­\ntory. It allows certain minor modifications (w e shall not concern \nourselves with the problem of aberrants), but its real problem is to \ntransform a law spontaneously obeyed into a law made con­\nsciously obligatory. In no other domain is this procedure of tech­\nnique as clear-cut as in the present forward movement of the econ­\nomy. The effects of technique in other areas are not as evident; for \nexample, the effects of “human techniques” such as propaganda \nhave not yet been rendered obligatory to the same degree as tech­\nnique in the economic field.\nThus, economic techniques, despite their still rudimentary na­\nture (often more pronounced in this respect than mechanical, psy- \nvuulugical, or judicial techniques), nevertheless express better than\nany others the transition, implied by every technique, from the \nnatural to the artificial. It is not that economic techniques are better \ndeveloped than the others, but that here, more than elsewhere, the \nartificialevolves from the natural.\nEvery technique tends, more or less, to constrain nature; accord­\ningly, the artificial is opposed to the natural. There is a struggle, \nbut whether it be expressed in terms of man against nature or in \nterms of the conflict of systems, the desideratum is a mastery that \nexcludes, eliminates, and replaces the natural. Thus, for example,\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 2 1 7\nthe directed and planned economy replaces liberalism. But we \nnote in this domain another more subtle, integrative movement. \nEconomic technique tends less to eliminate the natural than to inte­\ngrate it. (In this sense it approaches the mode of action of physical \ntechniques. And Francois Perroux’s criticism of planning, relative \nto its \"lack of rationality,” rests on the fact that planning suppresses \nthe free mechanism of the economy instead of adhering to it and \ninterpreting it. The latter, for Perroux, should be the ideal of eco- \nnomictechnique.)\nBut when the natural is integrated, it ceases to be natural. It be­\ncomes part of the technical ensemble. It is an element of the mecha­\nnism, an element which must play its role, and no more. The role \nmay be plotted in advance. Even when, as in the case of servo­\nmechanisms, the improvement of technique introduces unforeseen \nelements and leaves a large part of the operation in the realm of \nthe natural, it is nonetheless integrated.\nI will be asked whether there is anything evil in this integration. \nI make no value judgments; I merely note that the human being \nwho acts on his own personal decisions, following what is in essence \na common tendency, a sociological current, acts freely, but that the \nsame tendency, once integrated into a system, becomes essen­\ntially and expressly obligatory.\nIt might be asked whether man had not lost his freedom even be­\nfore this integration, since he was obeying an already existing al­\nthough hidden imperative, now revealed by modem techniques. \nIs man more constrained than formerly merely because this impera­\ntive is recognized and written down in textbooks? This does not \nseem clearly evident. Even without reference to the danger rep­\nresented by monopoly of the secrets of our actions on the part of a \nfew ( and it is always the few who succeed in gaining control of the \ninstruments of technique), the simple act of writing it down \nchanges human obligation. In the sociological and economic world, \nthe result is comparable to the long-recognized transition from \nmorals to law. There, too, sanctions appear to have been decisive. \nWhat is the sanction against violating the moral law, or refusing \nto follow a sociological tendency, or disobeying natural economic \nlaw? And what is the sanction against a challenge of the law of the \nstate and the plan? Is not the difference clear? What is at stake \nhere is all of man’s liberty, the liberty to take chances, even to"

We see in this loss of liberty the \ndownward path into which technique is leading us.\nEconomic Mon\nLet us not overdramatize; it is not the goal of the technical move­\nment to drive men to the death penalty. Happily, its goal is more \nsubtle. The death penalty is only a straw, the existence of which \ntestifies to the fact that technique is in a transitory phase.\nThe transformation of natural law into technical law is accom­\npanied by the shaping of the human being; he is adapted and made \nto harmonize with what is to be. Social individualism corresponded \nto economic liberalism. The economic man corresponds to the \nplanned economy.\nI am aware that economic man was a creation of the liberal \nperiod and the first economic doctrinaires, but the question is to \nunderstand the problem. The term economic man generally re­\nferred to a purely theoretical concept. For the liberals, economic \nman was an abstraction created to satisfy the demands of economic \ninquiry. The conception was a working hypothesis. It was framed \nby omitting certain human characteristics, which man undeniably \npossesses in order to reduce him to his economic aspect of producer \nand consumer. The abstraction corresponded to a complete anthro­\npology, current at the beginning of the nineteenth century, which \ncan only be characterized as dichotomous.\nThis conception of man has had a changing history. The studies \nof Jean Merigot on economic man undertook to demonstrate that, \nin terms of the doctrine and economic theory of the present, this \nabstract simplification is no longer admissible, for two reasons. \nFirst, the human being is a whole and this whole changes in the \nvery act of being analyzed; and second, economic phenomena act \nand react correlatively to the totality of the human being. Conse­\nquently, Merigot asserts, it is impossible to be satisfied with this \none-sided view. But all this remains on a purely intellectual plane \nand the “progress\" he describes is to be found only in textbooks of \npolitical economy. The great satisfaction manifested by certain au­\nthors that the homo economicus is dead remains purely theoretical.\nI should like for my part to note another set of developments.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (219\nTechnique, and especially economic technique, does not en­\ncounter man in textbooks but in the flesh. One of the facts which \nseems to me to dominate the present epoch is that the further eco­\nnomic technique develops, the more it makes real the abstract con­\nception of the economic man. What was merely hypothesis tends to \nbecome reality incarnate. The human being is changing slowly un­\nder the pressure of the economic milieu; he is in process of becom­\ning the uncomplicated being the liberal economist constructed. The \ntransition of the purely theoretical image to its incarnation is what \nconcerns us here. It is occurring at a time when the theoretical \neconomist is beginning to take account of the real complexity of \nman, a complexity which, however, man is in process of losing (if \nhe has not already lost it altogether). The result is that the modem \neconomist still runs the risk of theorizing about an abstraction be­\ncause he is speaking either of a man philosophically conceived \nor of some historical and traditional image. He is not speaking of the \nman of today, the man we do not dare to recognize because we can­\nnot bear to find in him our own faces or to meet in him the prefigur­\ning of our own destiny.\nThe economic man, that reduced schema of economic activity, \nwas formulated in the second half of the nineteenth century by a \ntwofold movement. The first was the absorption, to a greater and \ngreater extent, of the entire man in the economic network. The \nsecond was the devaluation of all human activities and tendencies \nother than the economic. Thence arose the validation of the pro- \nducing-consuming part of man, while all his other facets were grad­\nually erased. This reduction of man is the first movement to come \nto completion under the reign of the triumphant bourgeoisie. It is \nhardly necessary at this point, by way of explanation, to recall the \npredominant importance that money assumed during this period. \nEverything happened through its agency, in the economic and \nsocial structure, in the business world, in private life. Nothing hap­\npened without money; everything happened by means of it. All \nvalues were reduced to money values, not only by the theoreticians \nbut by practice. The only important human occupation seemed to \nbe to make money. And this became, in fact, the symbol of human \nsubmission to economies, an internal submission more serious than \nthe external. For primitive man, hunting likewise represented eco­\nnomic submission, but this submission was more a magical and\n\f\ntto) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY\nvirile act. The bourgeois domination of the nineteenth century was a \nrational domination. It excluded all romantic enthusiasm. It sought \nnot paradise but temporal power, and marveling at what had come \nto pass, it took the newly discovered economic forces as its instru­\nments of choice. But to use these instruments meant submission to \nthem. The bourgeoisie itself submitted and compelled everyone \nelse to submit. The world was divided into two classes: those who \ncreated the economy and amassed its rewards, and those who sub­\nmitted to it and produced its riches. Both classes were possessed by \ni t  The bourgeoisie, in a two-pronged attack, constructed an eco­\nnomic morality which exhausted the totality of its values and sub­\nordinated men to economic power. A new spiritual situation was \ncreated that was ultimately destined to make the new bourgeois \nmorality collapse, leaving intact the primacy of the economic.\nThe bourgeois morality was and is primarily a morality of work \nand of metier. Work purifies, ennobles; it is a virtue and a remedy. \nWork is the only thing that makes life worthwhile; it replaces God \nand the life of the spirit More precisely, it identifies God with \nwork: success becomes a blessing. God expresses his satisfaction by \ndistributing money to those who have worked w ell Before this \nfirst of all virtues, the others fade into obscurity. If laziness was \nthe mother of all the vices, work was the father of all the virtues. \nThis attitude was carried so far that bourgeois civilization neglected \nevery virtue but work.\nIt is understandable that for the adult bourgeois the only im­\nportant thing became the exercise of a metier, and for the youth, \nthe choice of an occupation and preparation for it. A kind of eco­\nnomic predestination was established in the great families. Human \ndestiny seemed to revolve about the making of money or the fail­\nure to make it. Such was, and is, the viewpoint of the bourgeois.\nFor the proletariat the result was alienation, which likewise rep­\nresented the grip of the economic on the human being. In the pro­\nletariat, we see human beings emptied of all human content and \nreal substance, and possessed by economic power. The proletarian \nwas alienated not only because he was the servant of the bourgeois \nbut because he became a stranger to the human condition, a sort of \nautomaton filled with economic machinery and worked by an eco­\nnomic switch. But human nature cannot long tolerate such a condi­\ntion. In creating it, the bourgeoisie signed the death warrant of its"

The spiritual situation of alienated man implies revo­\nlution, and his subordination without hope demanded the creation \nof the revolutionary myth. It might be thought that the primacy of \nthe economy over man (or, rather, the possession of man by the \neconomy) would have come into question. But unfortunately, the \nreal, not the idealized, proletarian has concentrated entirely on \nousting the bourgeoisie and making money. The proletarian instru­\nment for winning this revolution is the labor union. And the union \nsubordinates its members even more closely to the economic func­\ntion in the process of satisfying their revolutionary will and ex­\nhausting their will with regard to purely economic objects.\nThe bourgeois himself is losing ground, but his system and his \nconception of the human being is gaining. For the proletariat, as \nfor the bourgeoisie, man is only a machine for production and \nconsumption. He is under obligation to produce. He is under the \nsame obligation to consume. He must absorb what the economy \noffers him. Indeed, in the face of a historically unparalleled con­\nsumption of goods, it is ridiculous to explain crises of overproduc­\ntion as crises of underconsumption.\nThe counterpart of the necessary reduction of human life to \nworking is its reduction to gorging. If man does not already have \ncertain needs, they must be created. The important concern is not \nthe psychic and mental structure of the human being but the unin­\nterrupted flow of any and all goods which invention allows the \neconomy to produce. Whence the measureless trituration of the \nhuman soul, the true issue of which is propaganda. And propa­\nganda, reduced to advertising, relates happiness and a meaningful \nlife to consumption. He who has money is the slave of the money he \nhas. He who has it not is the slave of a mad desire to get it. The first \nand great law is consumption. Nothing but this imperative has any \nvalue in such a life.\nThis summary description enables us to grasp quickly the sub­\njective and incoherent way in which the human being tends to per­\nmit himself to be reduced to the two closely related variables of \nthe economic man. All other dimensions are excluded in this ideal­\nized concept Money is the principal thing; culture, art, spirit, mo­\nrality are jokes and are not to be taken seriously. On this point, there \nis once again full agreement between the bourgeoisie and the Com­\nmunists.\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY222  )\nThe phenomenon we witness here is the birth in reality of the \neconomic man the classical economists postulated. Man is not essen­\ntially homo economicus. But the concept is relatively simple; and \nthe pressure of economic events, greater than ever before, has \nmade it necessary to put man through this rolling-mill in order to \nobtain the indispensable material substratum. The operation has \nnot always been easy. Sometimes the machine has gotten stuck. \nThe bourgeoisie did not succeed entirely in eliminating the life of \nthe spirit. In the working class, a true spiritual life developed about \nthe turn of the century. Literature with Rimbaud and painting \nwith Van Gogh were enormously attractive in comparison with the \nrolling-mill. Man remained, if not whole, at least dissatisfied with \nhis castration, the more so as the promises which had been made \nwere not kept and economic crises continually endangered the \nnew blessings.\nThe second phase of this development was the attempt of the \nhuman being to find Spiritual satisfaction within the economic \nsphere itself. Karl Marx carried out the encircling maneuver, taking \nover from the bourgeoisie and continuing its work. On the plane \nof the human and of spiritual life, Marx was— in a deep and not \nmerely formal sense— a faithful representative of bourgeois \nthought. He did not represent the official thought of the bour­\ngeoisie in the manner of Thiers or Guizot. But he did represent the \ncurrent thought of the average man, which ideologically was ma­\nterialistic and in practice was even more so. Marx sought to make \na going concern of what, he was convinced, the bourgeoisie was in \nthe process of losing. To the spiritual force of the emergent- prole­\ntariat, he added economic force. He integrated the revolution, as \nwell as all life, into the economic world. He consecrated, theoreti­\ncally and scientifically, the common sentiment of all the men of his \ncentury and furnished it with the prestige of dialectic. Proudhon \nand Bakunin had placed spiritual forces in rivalry with the eco­\nnomic order. Against them, Marx upheld the bourgeois order of the \nprimacy of the economic, not, however, as a merely historical pri­\nmacy but as a primacy in human hearts. If economic conditions \nare changed, men are changed. Marx made a success of the terrible \nconfiscation. The spiritual resources released from oppression were \nto be put at the service of the oppressor, not, indeed, the bourgeois \noppressor but the economic one. (In my Presence au monde mod-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2  2 3\nerne I have studied in detail this mutation of the revolutionary \nidea.)\nThe second prong of this double movement (the subordination \nof men to economic power) did not apply to all men, only to those \nwho ventured to escape from the subjective creation represented \nby the homo economicus. We have been studying how this con­\ncept was slowly and circuitously brought into being by certain \nmodes of thought, social conditions, and doctrines. Its progress was \ninsidious and sometimes groping. But the individual still had cer­\ntain possibilities of escaping it. The escape hole was narrow and \ngrowing narrower. Sometimes escape was found only in dreams. \nPoetry is useful to this end. Rostand, for example, faithfully served \nto satisfy the homo economicus by giving him an illusion of the \nspiritual. And Peguy taught us, not in his writings but in his life, \nthat the whole man was still possible. In proportion as the milieu \nbecame more restrictive, the economic world approached comple­\ntion. It became more and more difficult for anyone to do anything \nexcept work in order to live. But for what? Exclusively for consump­\ntion. Leisure was granted to man, but only the leisure of the con­\nsumer. Man’s primordial functions of creating, praying, judging \ndisappeared in the rising tide of material goods. Conditions were \nat last ripe for bringing off the decisive operation. Technique com­\npleted its movement of encirclement and put the finishing touch to \nthe economic man, in accordance with its unchanging procedure \nof transforming what is into what ought to be and making out of \nmere gropings an irrefutable and simple line. Technique was no \nlonger a spontaneous movement; it was a concerted action to shape \nthe economic man it needed.\nIn order for economic technique (for example, planning) to \nsucceed, men had to satisfy its requirements. There is no such \nthing as technique by and in itself. In its irresistible forward prog­\nress, it forced the human individual, without whom it is nothing, \nto accompany it. For this reason economic man, a working hypoth­\nesis when economics was only a doctrine, was forced to become \nreality when reality became technical. This mutation (which had \nbeen prepared in the manner we have studied) was not completely \na creation of technique, but technique found in it what it required. \nStalin* as well as the liberal economists, considered man as “capi­\ntal.” And Jacques Aventur has shown that, from the technical\n\f\nTECHNIQUE and economy** 4 )\npoint of view, man must be appraised as capital. To recoil before \nthis conception is merely a sentimental reaction. No efficiency is \npossible for economic technique in the absence of exact calculation \nof average human production costs and human profit-making abil­\nity. Man is capital, and he must become perfectly adapted to this \nrole. The actions proposed by technique to educate man for this \nrole fall into two distinct categories. The first is essentially economic \nand does not lead to immediate and direct action on human beings. \nThe second, however, implies the combination of various special \ntechniques and their intervention into human life.\nIn the first category is found the union of the two concepts, pro­\nducer and consumer. Although traditionally a distinction was made \nbetween them, planning brings them together. It is true that man is \nthereby restored to a certain unity, but the new reality takes in \neverything. All human functions are mobilized in the “production- \nconsumption” complex. This restoration of unity is, in a certain \nsense, a step forward, for it holds that production and consumption \nare perfectly adapted to each other and that two correlative and \ninterdependent functions may no longer be separated, as in liberal \ncapitalism. But what in one sense restores unity represents in an­\nother a circumscribing of the whole human being. To be in tech­\nnical equilibrium, man cannot live by any but the technical reality, \nand he cannot escape from the social aspect of things which tech­\nnique designs for him. And the more his needs are accounted for, \nthe more he is integrated into the technical matrix. It may seem \nparadoxical to hold that man becomes technicized as his needs are \nrespected. But technique itself teaches him that needs are not in­\ndividual, or, put more exactly, that individual needs are negligible. \nWhat technique envisages as needs is social needs as revealed by \nStatistics. Technique can and will take into consideration only \nman s social requirements. O f course no one denies the existence \nof individual needs. But when all human forces are attracted by \nthe labor of satisfying social needs, when these forces include edu­\ncation, orientation, proper environment, and hygiene, when at the \nsame time the goods necessary to the satisfaction of social needs \nare numerous and easy to come by while those satisfying individ­\nual needs are rare and hard to find, it is pure utopian abstraction to \nsay that nothing prevents the existence of individual needs. On the \ncontrary, human nature does. Technique entails socialization of\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2 2 5\nneeds because it takes only social needs into account. This explains \nwhy technical research is more and more compelled to act on the \nbasis of objective criteria of value. The measure of value, which has \nbeen made objective, better integrates man into his economic con­\ndition. A hierarchy can better be established when precise rules \nare specified which are based on the economic value of the human \nbeing.\nA second category of technical actions that are addressed di­\nrectly to man and modify him attests strongly to what has just been \nsaid. It is necessary to act upon the individual in his capacity of \nproducer so as to make him contribute his small share in carrying \nout the plan— that part of the operation, negligible in itself but in­\ndispensable to the whole, which technique has assigned to him. The \noperations of hundreds of workers depend with mathematical rigor \non the work done by a single individual. The joint responsibility of \nall the workers subject to the same technique is rigorous. In the \nname of this common responsibility, it is binding on every worker \nto execute his task strictly with the kind of enthusiasm that calls for \npersonal devotion. The technical means for compelling this devo­\ntion are well known, from human-relations techniques to the differ­\nent kinds of propaganda: shock brigades, Stakhanovism, socialist \nrivalry, and so on. The study of these technical means lies outside \nour study of the economic sphere. But it may be noted in passing \nthat they are closely connected with the technique of economics, \nwhich cannot be realized without them.\nIt is likewise possible to exert pressure upon the individual in \nhis capacity of consumer. Roughly speaking, the problem here \nis to modify human needs in accordance with the requirements of \nplanning. The constraints that operate on man as consumer are not \nas sharp and brutal as those which operate on him as producer. As I \nhave shown, the “spontaneous” creation of social needs among al­\nmost all men in our time justifies the application of economic tech­\nnique. But although planning must satisfy both needs and the tech­\nnical data, it is not at all certain that the correspondence between \nthe two will be perfect What is required then is a small adjust­\nment. After all, only social needs are in question here; there is small \ncause for us individualists to become upset. A sociological current \nis to be modified, but not the conscience of the individual. More­\nover, should not the means to this end reassure us? The more tech-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY226 )\nniques develop, the more unobtrusive they become. The use of the \npolice, or even more radical means such as famine, as in the first \nyears of the Soviet Union, shows a certain technical deficiency and \na want of tact\nThe necessary adjustments are effected through price manipu­\nlation and public relations. (Psychoanalysis has shown the malle­\nability of needs under the influence of public relations.) The same \ninfluences are here at work on social needs as were operative in the \nliberal economy. The only difference lies in the orientation of these \nmeans and in the person who uses them. Scientific, willed utiliza­\ntion systematically and definitely creates the economic man, who \nultimately comes to be nothing more than the “needs-yield com­\nplex.” But the human being no longer feels any particular distress \nat this, because the almost magical results of economic technique \ncome from perfect adjustment. The man who suffered under capi­\ntalism because of its spasmodic fits and starts and its spiritual un­\nsatisfactoriness, the individuals who suffered under a Communist \nregime because of fear and restraint, find themselves released from \nsuffering by this adaptation, when in either regime technique as­\nsumes primacy. In both situations, man’s spiritual needs are par­\ntially gratified by propaganda and, in both, technique demands \nactive participation of him. It even requires of him that he become \nintelligent, the better to serve the organization and the machine. \nThe stage in which the human being was a mere slave of the me­\nchanical tyrant has been passed. When man himself becomes a \nmachine, he attains to the marvelous freedom of unconsciousness, \nthe freedom of the machine itself. A spiritual and moral life is re­\nquired of him because the machine has need of such a life: no \ntechnique is possible with amoral and asocial men. Man feels him­\nself to be responsible, but he is not. He does not feel himself an ob­\nject, but he is. He has been so well assimilated to the economic \nworld, so well adjusted to it by being reduced to the homo economi- \ncus, in short, so well conditioned, that the appearance of personal \nlife becomes for him the reality of personal life.\nThus, the development of economic techniques does not formally \ndestroy the spiritual, but rather subordinates it to the realization of \nthe Great Design. Henceforth, there is no more need for the hy­\npothesis of the economic man. The whole of man’s life has be­\ncome a function of economic technique. In its realization, technique\n\f\nThe Technological Society (227\nitself has far transcended the timid hypotheses of the classical \neconomists. Man knows himself to be more and more free, for \ntechnique has eliminated all natural forces and in this way has \ngiven him the sense of being master of his fate. The new man being \ncreated before our very eyes, correctly tailored to enter into the \nartificial paradise, the detailed and necessary product of the means \nwhich he ordains for himself— that man is I."

Nothing \nelse could administer the decisions of economic policy. T  am not \nspeaking here merely of economic planning, to which the state \nalone can give a direction and a foundation. The whole of eco­\nnomic technique is confronted by the following dilemma: either it \nreceives from the state that sanction which alone can render it \nefficacious, or it must remain a mere abstraction, an offer without \na taker. But who believes that such a noble edifice can remain an \nabstraction? There is, in any case, one agency which asks nothing \nbetter than to intervene: the state. But then the state itself will be­\ncome technique.\n\f\nThe Technological Society(2 2 9\nThe State's Encounters with Technique\nAncient Techniques. The state has always exploited techniques to \na greater or lesser degree. This is not new. But the techniques of \nthe state, corresponding to the limited functions of the state, were \nhitherto encountered only in limited domains. Let us consider \nbriefly the techniques employed by the state on the eve of the \nFrench Revolution.\nThere was, first of all, a military technique. This technique rep­\nresented even then a very advanced system. It had undergone a \ngreat development in many respects and it involved a loosening of \nthe traditional rigidities. There had been much improvement, for \nexample, in the art of fortification and, above all, in tactics. Logis­\ntics, recruitment, and military hospitals had all experienced im­\nprovement. In my Memoire sur le recrutement, I have shown that \nthe study of Le Tellier and Louvois on this subject fails because \nthey confuse civil and military administration.\nIn logistics and related fields, France had experienced the high­\nest development. Tactics made an extraordinary leap forward in \nthe eighteenth century and became a technique of extreme preci­\nsion under Frederick the Great. According to Frederick’s concep­\ntion, battles were to be won through the execution of certain \nmovements, with a minimum of combat and with minimal use of \nsoldiers. Skill in position and movement would necessarily lead \nthe enemy to surrender. According to Guglielmo Ferrero, economy \nof means and an almost guaranteed success were characteristics \nof this technique— already far advanced.\nThe French Revolution, however, brought about a decisive re­\ngression in tactical technique through its introduction of popular \narmies and mass levies of soldiers. With the Revolution, tactics \nsank little by little into obscurity. Military strategy and its related \nservices developed and gave rise to innumerable techniques; but \ntactical science remained inert. Thus, in modern wars enormous \nmasses of human and material means are employed, and, more \noften than not, are sacrificed to a dubious outcome. To offset this, \nmedical and supply services have at their disposal a vast apparatus\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE230)\nthat operates with great efficiency as a result of technical improve­\nments. (The American Army in 1944 was the most remarkable \nexample of this.) Epidemics, for instance— hitherto the universal \naccompaniment of war— claimed no victims in the last two wars \n(with the exception of the year 1918-19). Military technique, \ntaken as a whole and in its various forms, represents a very old \ntechnique which at the present is executed entirely by the state \nand devised by its employees.\nA financial technique, corresponding to the financial function, \nhad likewise evolved and by the time of the Revolution was al­\nready of great age and comparatively highly developed. In fact, of \nall techniques, financial technique had evolved most rapidly; it had \nalready arrived at a stage at which no further improvement was \nthought necessary. Here, too, the state was the prime mover. \nPhilip IV had initiated a number of financial techniques which \nwere completed between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries. \nAmong Philip's innovations were double-entry bookkeeping, budg­\netary management and forecasting, separation of the services of \nthe Budget and the Treasury, and the theory of loan management.\nThe state, however, did not play an exclusive role in matters re­\nlating to financial techniques. There were financiers who were also \nmerchants and who used for their own ends a merchandising tech­\nnique they helped to develop. But although the role of the state \nwas not exclusive, it was decisive: it was in connection with the \nstate that these techniques reached their apex. After the progress \nthat had already been made, the system seemed scarcely suscepti­\nble of further development. Napoleon’s reforms were limited to \ncertain trivial alterations and to restoring certain features which \nhad fallen into disorder. By and large, financial technique remained \nwhat it had been. It is true that its objects (taxes) and its organs \n(administrations) were profoundly perturbed, but these two ele­\nments did not, properly speaking, represent financial technique, \nand the technique itself continued to give satisfaction up to the \nbeginning of the present century, when a rational and general \nsystematization began to penetrate this domain. But the technique \nitself was still so well articulated that it was and is very difficult to \nchange. Everyone recognizes that it no longer squares with other \ntechniques and that its influence is retardatory. But its very power \nof resistance shows the excellence of its mechanism. There are two\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 2 31\nnecessary conditions for the initiation of a real change; the integra­\ntion of the finances into the general economy, and the transforma­\ntion of the concept of public finance.

For this reason, judicial technique was never \ncompletely able to take over the law as a whole. A certain conflict \ncontinued, after the Roman era, between justice and technique and, \nin the period under consideration, this conflict seems to have be­\ncome fixed. I shall treat this problem in all its complexity later on.\nAn administrative technique corresponded to the administrative \nfunction. But this technique was much less clearly defined than \nthe others I have enumerated. As in the relation between law and \njudicial technique, administrative technique represented an un­\ncertain area because of the human element. The state never pos­\nsessed the means, during the course of history, to convert its wishes \ninto techniques, that is, to make them efficient. Louis XIV assumed \nthe tone of an absolute monarch, but he did not possess the practical \nmeans to make his subjects obey his will in any well defined way. \nHe had neither police nor administrative cadres. All he could do \nwas coerce a few persons and make examples of them. However, \nterror is only exceptionally a technical means. The whole French \nadministrative system was based on mere empiricism. Napoleon \nwas able to systematize the administration in a rational way and to \ncreate a technical organ. But there were still no means for securing \nefficient action. It is difficult to see how there could have been, in \nthe absence of both material substratum and method. A very simple \nexample of the material substratum is the means of communication. \nIt was scarcely possible to have a technicized administration when \norders from the central administration in Paris took at least eight \ndays to reach Marseille. Every kind of local latitude was encour­\naged by such delay. As to method, it was not known how the ad­\nministration ought to act with respect to the persons administered! \nOnly constraint by force was recognized, and even that was merely \nempirical. Likewise, the choice of the persons upon whom con­\nstraint was to operate was not made with any rational rigor.\nMuch more technical rules of organization and administrative\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE33a)\naction began to appear toward the end of the nineteenth century; \nthey formed the content of administrative law. The concepts of \npublic function, of centralization and decentralization, and so on, \nbegan to assume more precise outlines. But these concepts still \nrepresented a mere theory. Out of it, however, emerged the tech­\nnical improvements necessitated by the very existence of great \nmasses of people. But the actions dictated by this theory still \noffered a very great latitude of choice. There was no certainty as \nto which method was really the most efficient because experimenta­\ntion was possible only on a very limited scale. In this theoretic \ndomain, all choices and all arguments were still possible. Ad­\nministrative law was still not radically and indisputably the best \nsystem. It may be said, therefore, that at the beginning of the \ntwentieth century administrative technique did not yet exist.\nFinally, the state fulfilled a political function, a function of \ngeneral direction into which all the others were combined and \nwhich addressed itself to foreign as well as to domestic affairs. \nBut on the eve of the Revolution this political function was in its \ninfancy. There was no political technique of any sort; \"secret di­\nplomacy” could not possibly have been called a technique. Policy \nwas delivered over to the whims of a Minister of the Interior, or an \nambassador, or a Chamber of Deputies, or a dictator. There was \nnothing but flair, personal ability, special interest, routine. Political \ntheories never gave rise to any realistic practical application, only \nto bad copies of historical situations and to political circumstances \nwhich had to be endured with fortitude. In spite of the frequent \nmention of Machiavelli's Prince, the truth is that until the beginning \nof the twentieth century no one ever drew the technical conse­\nquences of that work. What existed, then, was a kind of original \nchaos in which the umu of genius always outclassed his adversar- \nies because they never had at their disposal a technique which \nsufficed to redress the balance. The beginnings of a political \ntechnique had to await the appearance of Lenin. And even Lenin’s \npolitical technique in many respects had to be based on certain \nother techniques which he did not hava.at his disposal; for example, \ntechniques for obtaining scientific knowledge of the masses and \nthe modes of action applicable to them, techniques of temporal \nand spatial co-ordination, techniques of strategy, and social tech-\n\f\nTheTechnologicd Society (2 3 3\nniques on a global scale. All these are only today in the process of \nbeing elaborated.\nThe most important technical activity of the state remained \ncompletely empirical until the beginning of the twentieth century. \nNevertheless, the state did press into service a certain number of \nother techniques which we have already examined. However, the \ntechniques used by the state had one characteristic in common: \nall of them were limited both in their objects and in their means. \nThey referred to particular questions and did not extend beyond \nthe framework of the particularities. Moreover, they were merely \nco-ordinated and were only sporadically applied. Nevertheless, \nthere were, in the immense field of state activity, certain technicized \npoints which offered some degree of permanence. Whatever real \nrelation these sustained to one another was effected by the organism \ncommon to them all, the state.\nNew Techniques. The state was fated sooner or later to come into \ncontact with other methods. Since the end of the eighteenth century \nit has gradually encountered all techniques and finally the technical \nphenomenon itself. From the political, social, and human points of \nview, this conjunction of state and technique is by far the most \nimportant phenomenon of history. It is astonishing to note that no \none, to the best of my knowledge, has emphasized this fact It is \nlikewise astonishing that we still apply ourselves to the study of \npolitical theories or parties which no longer possess anything but \nepisodic importance, yet we bypass the technical fact which ex­\nplains the totality of modern political events, and which indicates \nthe general line our society has taken much more surely than some \npainful revival of Marx ( who was not acquainted with the techni­\ncal fact) or some spiritualistic theory. These so-called “explana­\ntions” are mere utopias and flourish only as utopias flourish.\nThis ignorance of tire technical phenomenon springs perhaps from \nan obdurate traditionalism which causes us always to live in the \npast and explain the present without understanding it. Thereby, \nour grasp of social events lags by half a century. Or it may spring \nfrom an unconscious repression. We simply will not to see whatever \nis too difficult for us to bear or whatever bulks too large for our \nunderstanding. However the case may be, it is striking to note \nthat such political thinkers as Max Class interpret the facts of the\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND TIE  STATE234 )\npresent by means of concepts that date from the turn of the \ncentury. At best, they talk about “technical barbarism\" without \ntaking into account that such terms do not represent anything \nreal and that the term barbarism in this domain can only come out \nof the decadent society of igoo. If one quits this kind of tradi­\ntionalism, one falls straightway into an extravagant metaphysic, \nsuch as that of the Jesuit Father Teillard de Chardin, which has no \nmore substance.\nWe take it, then, that in the present century the state has en­\ncountered the technical phenomenon in a far different framework \nfrom the traditional. How has this encounter been effected? There \nare a multiplicity of causes. We shall not concern ourselves with \ngeneral causes such as the diffusion of ideas, demography, national­\nism and colonialism, the influence of finance on the state, and so \non. All these factors are well known and are dealt with in numer­\nous textbooks. We shall apply ourselves here to those causes which \nstand in direct relationship to technique.\nThe first cause is the rapid extension of techniques formerly em­\nployed only by individuals into domains which the state had never \nbefore penetrated. Among these techniques were those of trans­\nport, education, aid to the helpless and indigent, and even spiritual \ntechniques (as represented by the Congregation “de Propaganda \nFide” or the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola). The use of \nthese techniques had two effects: on the one hand, they produced \nclearer and more distinct results so that they attracted the attention \nof the state; and on the other, they allowed a considerable exten­\nsion of the field of activity to which they were applied. For exam­\nple, they were able to reach the masses of men. But the moment \nthey proved themselves able to operate efficiently on the masses, \nthey ceased to be purely private. The state could no longer remain \ndisinterested.\nWhen instruction was imparted by a few masters on the Pont \ndes Arts, or in a small number of episcopal colleges, there were \nonly a handful of students— and de minimis non curat praetor.l By \nthe time the technique of organization and pedagogy permitted \nthe creation of the university, however, the state’s attention was\nA Roman legal maxim: “The praetor [the state] has no concern for trifles.*’ (Trans.)\n\f\nTheTechndogical Society ( 2 3 5\ninevitably attracted by this much more grandiose phenomenon. It \nwas impossible for the state not to feel directly concerned, espe­\ncially when in the eighteenth century certain ecclesiastics such as \nJean-Baptiste de la Salle aspired to make education free and com­\npulsory by way of a new pedagogy which could be directly ad­\ndressed to all children.\nPut another way, these techniques, because they were applicable \nto the masses, allowed individual persons to transform their sphere \nof activity from a private to a public one. These techniques seemed \ndesigned for this very purpose. And to the degree that their in­\nfluence increased, they had to come into contact with the state \nitself, since they collided with the fundamental principles of state \npower. In any case, the private persons who had developed these \ntechniques gradually ceased to be able to utilize them because \nthey came to exceed the possibilities of any individual. When ap­\npeal was not made to the state, it was necessary, for their exploita­\ntion, to set up organisms as vast and powerful as the state itself. \nThus, trusts and corporations were rendered necessary by the \ntechnical apparatus. This occurred even in the absence of the \nprofit motive, after wealth had become incommensurable with the \nindividual and therefore abstract. The prime purpose of state or \ncorporation might even be to rob and despoil the individual by \nthe exploitation of these techniques. I repeat that it could not have \nbeen otherwise. From a certain degree of development onward, \nevery technique concerns the collectivity of men.\nIt would be unthinkable for us today to leave in private hands \nreally efficient instruments such as atomic energy. In 1949 a report \nwas presented to the Congress of the United States emphasizing \nthe fact that the study and production of atomic energy must re­\nmain in the public domain. It would likewise be unthinkable that \na private citizen have the radio at his disposal in order to unleash \na campaign of agitation on a world scale. In every country the \nradio is at least under the supervision of the state, whether it is \nunder direct state control or in private hands. No matter how \nliberal the state may be, it is obliged by the mere fact of technical \nadvance to extend its powers in every possible way.\nThe second cause of the interrelation of state and technique is \ndirectly related to the first; the application of techniques is ex-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 3 «)\ntremely expensive. Whatever realm we survey, we note that it \nbecomes gradually impossible for personal or familial capital, how­\never concentrated, to answer technical requirements.\nModern research in nuclear physics implies that the state must \npay the bill No private person could support the cost of cyclotrons \nand their auxiliary apparatus. Once a certain degree of technical \nprogress has been achieved, continual improvements give rise to \ninstrumentation so complex and large that the cost price is inacces­\nsible to the individual. The present growth of cost price in all \ntechnical domains is unparalleled, even in recent history. The pub­\nlic has gained some faint conception of this through the prices of \nsome of the recently discovered “wonder drugs” such as strepto­\nmycin. But it fails to realize the magnitude of the growth of other \ncost figures. For example, one hour of flight in a B-17 bomber (com­\nparable to the larger commercial passenger aircraft) cost 60,000 \nfrancs in 1944. The B-36, which replaced the B-17, cost 400,000 \nfrancs per flight hour in 1950. There is a comparable growth in the \ncost of the machines themselves. The B-17 cost 120 million francs; \nthe B-36, 1 billion 600 million. These cost prices, officially recog­\nnized in 1951, have been far surpassed. Thus, the prototype of the \nB-52 cost, on the day of its commissioning, 40 billion francs. An \nanalogous growth of cost price applies to all techniques. The prices \nindicated are virtually the same for commercial aviation, equipped \nwith the latest technical improvements. Private companies no \nlonger exist which are able to support such expense. A blast furnace \nfor a modern steel plant costs 8 billion francs; a hot rolling-mill, \n12 billion; a cable mill, 7 billion. Altogether, a plant capable of \nproducing a million tons of steel annually requires a primary in­\nvestment of 125 billion francs. It is impossible not to appeal to the \nstate to make up with subventions the insufficient resources of \nprivate enterprise. We have already noted the alternative: the slow­\ndown of technical progress occasioned by private capitalism. Such \na slowdown would be regarded as intolerable, and could not last \nvery long.\nThe problem has nothing to do with debates about “nationaliza­\ntion.” No more relevant is the allegation that the state frequently \napplies techniques with “less ability” than private enterprise, or that \nit “wastes money.” What I am emphasizing here is that the prin­\ncipal menace to capitalistic individualism is not some theory or\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( * 3 7\nother, but technical progress. T o take another example, it is clear \nthat, as city-planning techniques develop, they will give rise to\nmore extended and precise urban research, to urgent reconstruc­\ntion plans, and to a new and completely indispensable conception \nof the city. It is impossible to go on indefinitely contemplating \nthese plans on paper; a technique must be applied. The only ques­\ntion is: who shall apply it?\nElectrical networks may remain for some time independent of \none another. But this situation cannot last when it is found that \nindependence gives rise to general costs of no inconsiderable \nmagnitude, difficulties in arranging the courses of the lines, and \neven practical difficulties in electrical technique. The interconnec­\ntion of electrical networks is demanded by all technical men. \nAgain, the only question is: who will execute it? And it is immedi­\nately clear that only the state is in a position to do so. The problem \nis even more acute when it is a question of the interconnection of \nthe lines of several nations, not merely the domestic lines of a single \ncountry. (An international European network is already pro­\njected.)\nWhatever the area of interest, problems are raised by technology \nwhich demand technical solutions but which are of such magni­\ntude that they cannot be solved by private enterprise: for example, \npollution of water supplies and of the urban atmosphere. These \nphenomena, which have assumed such proportions that they \nthreaten the whole of city life, are of purely technical origin. Only \nrigorous and authoritarian measures of general control can solve \nthese problems if they are to be solved at all That is to say, appeal \nto dictatorial state action is indispensable.\nThese problems all exceed the powers of private individuals. \nTechnique, once developed to a certain point, poses problems that \nonly tire state can resolve, both from the point of view of finance \nand from that of power.\nThe third cause of the interrelation of state and technique is the \ntransformation of the role of the state and of its conceptions of its \nrole. The state takes on increasingly extended and numerous ac­\ntivities. It considers itself the ordainer and preceptor of the nation. \nIt takes charge of the national life and becomes the nation-state. \nThe phenomenon of the nation-state has appeared as a result of \nthe coincidence of a variety of circumstances upon which it is\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE238)\nuseless to insist here. Let us simply note, first, that the state seeks \nto organize national life and to govern its various collectivities, \nmost often because natural communities have disappeared and it is \nnecessary to create new ones. Second, the state seeks to fashion the \n“individualist” society (the role the twentieth century has elected \nto play) and to penetrate into men’s private lives on the ground \nthat they are no longer able materially to manage their own af­\nfairs. Finally, all kinds of theories, both socialist and nonsocialist, \nare influential; but, whatever their nature, they all appeal to the \nstate to secure a greater degree of justice and equality. In all these \nways the state assumes functions which were formerly the province \nof private groups. And in performing these functions, the state \nencounterstechniques hitherto employed by individuals.\nWhen, for example, the state takes charge of education, it en­\ncounters two technical elements originally developed by private \npersons: a complete educational organization and a pedagogy. The \nstate, in taking over any activity, encounters the techniques of that \nactivity and sees its technical potential augmented thereby. The \naugmentation of potential reciprocally brings the state into closer \nrelation with the technique. Nowhere is this relation clearer than \nin the economic field. When the state establishes itself as producer \nand consumer, it enters the older domain of exploitation by indi­\nviduals. It is confronted with a complete technical system the \nbroad outlines of which have already been drawn and focused. \nBut basically the state enters this domain because productive and \neconomic techniques, the development of which we have already \nstudied, render such action indispensable. Thus, we have a two- \nway street: technical development inevitably brings about state \nintervention in the economic world; and, reciprocally, when the \nstate intervenes it finds a , technical apparatus which it develops \nfurther.\nThe economy, to a greater or lesser degree, conditions the creation \nof the nation-state. Alternative explanations— political and intel­\nlectual— are given for the creation, let us say, of the Fascist state. \nBut the most profound cause of this phenomenon was the economic \nimpasse in which Italy and Germany found themselves. The \nnation-state was primarily a response to the cessation of economic \nevolution. That there were other causal factors is clear, but we are \nseeking to locate the central cause. The problem of the adaptation\n\f\nThe Technological Society (239\nof the whole of society to the economic movement in all its ramifi­\ncations is not to be solved by economics alone. It is a technical \nproblem. The economy, with its enormous productive capacity, \nvolume of trade, mobilization of society, and economic techniques \nwhich thirst to be applied, is no longer a closed circle, a single \nactivity among others. It engages the life of the whole society and \nof all men in it\nEconomic problems are now problems of the whole of society. \nThe relation between the economy and all other human activities \ncan no longer be merely empirical. Liberalism sufficed for the \neconomy of a century and a half ago. Today it has no meaning. \nNo economic theory is eternally valid; every period demands its \nown. The problem of the adaptation of society to economy (and it \nis in this sense rather than in the inverse, traditional sense that the \nproblem must be posed) is a technical problem. That is to say, the \nproblem has a solution only in a certain arrangement, through \nthe mediation of the social apparatus and social mechanisms. This \nsupposes an adaptative intervention having as its object the whole \nof society and conscious of end and methods. Only a superior \npower, limited by nothing and possessing all instrumentalities, is \nin a position to proceed to this adaptation. This is what will bring \nabout the mobilization of all means by the state; in our day it is \ncompleting the encounter between state and techniques which was \nalready necessitated by the other factors we have studied.\nPrivate and Public Techniques. The techniques first developed by \nindividuals and later on encountered by the state present very dif­\nferent characteristics from those of traditional political techniques. \nIn their origin and development they manifest the following traits:\n1) They are better perfected and better adapted than the \ntechniques of the state. They represent the inspirations of individu­\nals acting out of personal interest or for those higher motives we call \nvocation. In either case the individual devotes himself to his task \nwholeheartedly and with passion; such a devotion is rarely to be \nfound among the creators of state techniques. There genuine en­\nthusiasm is found only for very limited periods. Thus, the councilors \nof Philip IV, the prefects of Napoleon, the Nazi Ftihrer, the \npeople’s commissars of the Soviet Union alone seem to have been \ncapable of rivaling the ardor and technical devotion of free workers \nwho have made technical progress.

    "raw_text": "TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE240)\npersonal motives seem to display more imagination. When the same \nproblems are posed simultaneously to the state and to individuals, \nthe individuals are usually the first to find the correct method and \nsolution. Whenever it has been of importance to secure acceptance \nfor some brand of goods, doctrine, product, or action, private per­\nsons (businessmen or religious groups) confronted with the same \nnecessities as the state have tended to respond much more rapidly. \nThe Church created propaganda; later, private commercial in­\nterests created publicity. The state and its propaganda came in a \npoor third. Even then, it was private persons who applied propa­\nganda long before the great systems of Lenin and Hitler. In France \nthe Maison de la Presse inaugurated efficient propaganda opera­\ntions in 1916. In England, a private organization, The Central \nCommittee for National Patriotic Organization, performed the \nsame function. Commercial interests found the most efficient prop­\naganda methods by exploiting the discoveries of psychology and \npsychoanalysis.\nIn the private creation of techniques there is a very great di­\nversity of methods. No one acts in accordance with a general \nschema. The individual always lives a much more realistic and real \nlife than a collectivity, especially the state. The individual con­\nsiders the problem as it really exists in its individuality and, as a \nconsequence, seeks the method that represents the best solution. \nThe state, on the other hand, acts on masses of men and on \nmultiple problems, and it is inevitably drawn to schematize and to \ndeny the complexity of problems. As a result, it is unable to dis­\ncover the technique best adapted to their solution. This is why \ntechniques created by individuals yield the best output and are \nbetter adapted to their objects, why they are techniques in the \ntruest sense. We discover the same thing in the following fact: \nthe individual possesses only limited financial resources and cannot \nallow himself the luxury of waste and excess. When he seeks the \nsolution of a difficulty, expense is a factor. He must find the least \ncostly mode of action; thus, he is brought around to economy of \nmeans, a characteristic of true technique which we have already \nexamined. Corroboration of this is found even in domains which \nconcern the state directly. Thus, the mechanization of state ad­\nministration is a result of experiments made by private banking \nhouses since 19x4 and by German industry since 1926. Only around\n\f\nThe Technological Society (241\n1940 did public administration begin to apply the “new” principles. \nThe state rarely discovers and applies any true techniques, for the \nsimple reason that it has too much power and too many financial \nresources for its agents to seek out economy of means— the first re­\nquirement. Its methods are, generally speaking, ponderous and ex­\npensive and require an enormous apparatus to secure mediocre \nresults. Its results are obtained, in fact, through the sheer enormity \nof the means employed rather than through their technical quality. \n(This is evident today in the French insurance industry.) The pri­\nvate person, on the other hand, is constrained by pecuniary neces­\nsity to develop true techniques. This also applies sometimes in the \ncase of a poor state. Such was the case in the Third Reich. Another \nfactor operated in favor of private persons throughout the nine­\nteenth century: capitalistic competition. Then techniques had not \nyet produced machines and methods exceeding human possibili­\nties; it was therefore mandatory to employ the most efficient tech­\nniques so as not to be crushed by the competition. Technical im­\nprovement usually conferred substantial competitive superiority. \nThis favored an acceleration of private technical progress right up \nto the time when it was no longer possible for the finances of \nprivate entities to keep pace with technical progress.\n2) Techniques elaborated by individuals were the result of \nspecialization, which operated at first in the scientific domain but \nwhich was introduced into the technical world before long. \nDuring the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth centuries, \nspecialization was conducive to the development of different tech­\nniques along very divergent lines. Every technical branch operated \nindependently of the others. Few or no relations existed among \nthem. There was no organ to co-ordinate their efforts. (The situa­\ntion was very different with the techniques of the state. Through \nthe co-ordinating effect of the state’s political function, as we have \nnoted, these techniques had a certain degree of co-ordination \namong themselves.) But it mattered little whether private tech­\nniques were or were not co-ordinated, since the majority of them \nhad as their end money profit, not the improvement of society. \nEvery individual found his own way to success. This specialization \nproduced very advanced techniques with which to deal with cir­\ncumscribed problems in certain areas but it left large areas barren \nand unexplored. This led to the impression, up to about 1930, of\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE242)\na certain incoherence and of an extraordinary inequality of de­\nvelopment; it also led to the common error, which still persists, \nthat technique and machine are identical. Undoubtedly it is this \ndispersion of technical operations that allows certain writers to \ndeny that they are dealing with a technical society. These super­\nficial observers do not deny that certain areas of society are affected \nby technique; but they assert that inumerable factors are inde­\npendent of it. This is a backward view of things, based on tradi­\ntional conceptions of society and completely removed from reality. \nBut it is true that co-ordination of the different techniques has \nstill not been completed; and wherever they remain in private \nhands they tend to remain specialized and unco-ordinated. How­\never, technical co-ordination is rapidly being extended, and it is \nbecoming less and less possible to speak of areas into which tech­\nnique has not penetrated.\n3) The techniques created by private individuals, contrary to \nthose of the state, rarely slacken their pace. They are in constant \nforward movement and progressively affect all spheres of human \nactivity. This has taken place only in the twentieth century, but it \nwas always of the essence of private activity that its techniques \nhad expansive power.\nWe have already studied the step-by-step development of priv­\nate techniques. It must in justice be added that private activity has \nalso been conducive to technical generalization. When in the past \nthe state created its techniques, it was satisfied with them as they \nwere and made no attempt at further progress, although this is no \nlonger the case today. However, private activity has never wearied \nof the struggle, particularly since it has become necessary to exploit \nall possibilities in order to survive. The population explosion, for \nexample, has encouraged the proliferation of private research. Sud­\ndenly there were too many people. It was impossible to employ all \nthe new workers, and even industrial production could not absorb \nthe extra manpower. It became a matter of prime necessity to dis­\ncover new industries and to utilize new work forms. Technique \nproved to be just the right means for exploring the possibilities. \nThe extension of the factory system, along with technical applica­\ntion in certain new domains, was the (unconscious) means of \nemploying the surplus workers. Simultaneously, however, it pre­\ncipitated crises of unemployment. (The two facts are intimately\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 243\nrelated.) Thus, techniques rapidly came to be employed every­\nwhere to a certain extent They have taken over not only all work­\ning life but also man’s diversions, which have been transformed into \nindustrial enterprises. Very soon man himself became the object of \ntechnique, a mere means to the end of profitmaking. Among the \nmost notable techniques developed and applied in this area are \npublic relations and human relations, which have as their goal to \nassociate, adapt, and integrate the human individual into the tech­\nnical milieu in such a way that he will not suffer from it.\nPrivate initiative, then, took the decisive step in the application of \ntechniques to man. State action could never have brought this to \npass. The state was too content with its coercive power to apply \nprecise techniques.\nThe Reaction of the State to Techniques. When, as a conse­\nquence of the circumstances we have studied, the state comes into \ncontact with the techniques elaborated by individuals, when it \nencounters a private sphere of action which techniques have trans­\nformed into a sphere of public interest, it reacts by taking over this \nsphere as well as the techniques which brought about the mutation.\nSometimes the state enters a field of action for very different \nreasons than the ones I have so far mentioned. The state will adopt \ntechniques simply because it finds them already functioning. How­\never evident this fact may be, it is necessary to emphasize it; to \nneglect it is to occasion many misunderstandings. The state will \nnot act otherwise than as individuals have already acted. Insurance \ncompanies have developed insurance techniques; when these com­\npanies are nationalized, the state retains the old mechanism. After \nall, there are only a limited number of ways of using actuaries or \nestablishing a police force. When an automobile manufacturing \nenterprise passes under state control, the tempo of the operations \nand the assembly line are not modified. This is particularly clear \nwith regard to material techniques, because techniques seem to us \nthe more constraining the more they are material. But, in fact, im­\nmaterial techniques display exactly the same characteristics.\nW hentheF rench Revolution tried to suppress the systems of edu­\ncation and of charities that the old regime had established through \nthe efforts of private persons, the attempts miscarried lamentably. \nThe effort to create a system of public assistance (hospitals and \nhomes for the elderly, for abandoned children, and for the poor)\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 4 4 )\nand a system of state education was a major enterprise of the Con­\nvention and of the Constituent Assembly. But these systems were \nfailures. Excessive systematization and theoretical precision some­\ntimes represent the exact opposite of a good technique. In these \ninstances, the state encountered an organization which was indeed \nimperfect but which was, after the technical improvements of the \nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, very nearly sufficient. Con­\nfronted by these institutions, the state, for theoretical reasons, set \nout to destroy and to re-create on paper systems of education and \nof public assistance which corresponded to the theoretical deci­\nsions and doctrines of the Convention, although they turned out to \nbe neither efficient nor technically sound. (In the realm of educa­\ntion, the state sought to break the power of the Church and estab­\nlish a wholly laicized system. In public assistance, the state set the \nconcept of justice in opposition to that of charity and desired to \ngive its support only to citizens.) The new systems, unfortunately, \nwere never able to function. With the Directory and the Consulate, \na backward movement set in. The revolutionary innovations made \nwith such difficulty were repudiated and the techniques that had \npreceded them were restored. The university and the colleges were \nreorganized in nearly the same way as the schools of the eight­\neenth century. The pedagogical system created by the Jesuits was \nrestored; hospices and hospitals were reconstituted as they had \nbeen before the Revolution. And since it was difficult to secure \nnew specialized personnel, the old personnel, monks and nuns, \nwere restored to duty. The great difference was that now all the \ninstitutions were under the control of the state. But although they \nfunctioned as organizations belonging to the state, they were in \nfact identical with the earlier private organizations. The arbitrary \ncreations of the Revolution having failed, it was necessary to use \nalready existing technical creations.\nThe same phenomenon appeared in the realm of finance under \nthe Third Reich. Hitler’s revolution claimed to have done away \nwith all the classical methods of finance; it wanted to be revolu­\ntionary in the management of nationalized enterprises, in the or­\nganization of commerce and monetary relations, and even in finan­\ncial technique. Insofar as National Socialism was a party, it \nemphasized the struggle against capitalism. Feders program pro­\nvided for a complete transformation of economic and financial life;\n\f\nThe Technological Society (245\nmanipulation of money, prices, and wages would lead to the dis* \nappearance of capitalism, and to this end completely new financial \nforms were recommended. But, little by little, financial necessity \nin its most traditional form reasserted itself: to accomplish reforms, \nmoney was needed. In 1938 Schacht reaffirmed the old position \nthat only the orthodox financial technique of capitalism was capa­\nble of furnishing the funds necessary to the Nazi state. Rejection \nof inflation, short-term financing, refusal to use currency for financ­\ning— all thesewere traditional principles of financial technique. The \nfinancial machinery of the Third Reich was nearly identical with \nthat of the Empire in 1914. All this is characteristic of the sub­\nmission of state and revolutionary doctrine to enemy principles \nthrough the effects of techniques, which, when they are efficient, \nare necessarily common to both. In essence, the Nazis turned from \ntechnically untenable inventions back to an efficient financial tech­\nnique, a technique identical with the one that dominated in the \ncapitalistic countries and in the Soviet Union. At a given moment \nand in a given framework, there are only a limited number of tech­\nniques for attaining a given result.\nThe technical phenomenon is not modified when an organization \npasses under state control. According to Simone Weil, this explains \nwhy a system of industrial rationalization, which ought normally \nto develop into socialism, in fact can only exacerbate the worker’s \ncondition. Fourastie agrees (perhaps involuntarily) when he \nwrites: \"If technical development has been intensive, then, what­\never the nature of judicial conditions, profits, unearned income and \neven political regime, there has been improvement in consumer \npurchasing power. This is the essential source of the social progress \nbrought about by the last century and a half.” This amounts to \nsaying that technical progress breaks down all barriers and tech­\nnique imposes its structures and social progress. This forward \nmotion of technique is a constant, whatever the variables of the \nquestion may be.\nThe state cannot modify technical rules; and should it attempt \nto do so for doctrinal reasons, it suffers an inevitable setback. For \nthis reason, the transition of the economy to state control can create \nonly state capitalism, not socialism. Socialism implies the suppres­\nsion of the state. (We shall see further on what it implies with \nrespect to technique.) Insofar as the state continues to exist, noth-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE246)\ning prevents it from calling itself socialist, but in reality nothing \nhas changed. It is only a sleight-of-hand trick to say that the same \ninstitution with the same rules, applied in the same way and having \nthe same results, is socialist when it is at the service of the people \nand capitalist when it is at the service of capitalist institutions. \nWhat does it mean to be at the “service of the people”? Such an \nexpression can only designate the service of a state which calls \nitself socialist, although it does not proceed democratically from \nthe people. But what does it mean to be socialist under these con­\nditions? It means to be at the service of the people. We are going \naround in a circle. One of the gravest symptoms of our times is \nthat technique has little by little emptied socialism of any con­\ntent. Beyond evident facts— such as the relation of Stakhanovism \nto Taylorism, or the identity of police methods in the Soviet Union \nand in Fascist countries— a major example is the persistence of the \ncapitalist’s so-called “surplus value” (in reality, profit) in socialistic \nregimes. The financial system of the Soviets is based, to the extent \nof 80 per cent, on the difference between wages paid to the work­\ners and the value of their product. This profit, which the socialist \nregime professes to have eliminated, has actually been extended. \nThe only difference is that it goes into the coffers of the state in­\nstead of the corporation’s cash box. But in capitalist regimes the \ncorporation tends to become a public entity. Mikoyan, in his speech \nof October 17, 1953, declared: “Capitalist commerce has certain \ntechnical features that we ought to study. By reason of competition \nand the difficulty of attracting customers, capitalist countries have \ndeveloped exact methods of commercial organization These ought \nto be applied in those areas of the Soviet Union where they are \nlikely to prove efficient.”\nI could go on and show that all technical rules and institutions \nare identically reproduced in the socialist state. This means that \nthere are no longer any specifically1  socialist institutions. Nor are \nthere any adminisrative or economic organizations which are pe­\nculiarly the result of socialism. The socialist state, because it is \nefficient, has been obliged to adopt the technical principles of \ncapitalism. Hence, in order to distinguish the socialist situation \nfrom the others, socialism always falls back on that vaguest of all \nconcepts, teleology. Capitalism, it is said, has regard only for itself; \nit seeks but to preserve itself. Socialism, on the other hand, is a\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( a47\nconstructive force on the march. But nothing warrants the belief \nthat the means employed will result in socialism. Teleology can \nonly create a stir for a short time as an instrument of propaganda; \nbut it is far from certain that such propaganda can give character \nto socialism, which more and more is losing its specific reality as \na result of technique.\nThe state, by taking possession of all technical spheres and in­\nstrumentalities, becomes of necessity a capitalist state, substituting \nitself for private capitalists. And when it has come to understand \nits real interest, it adds nothing and modifies nothing that, techni­\ncally speaking, pre-existed. When the state realizes the use it can \nmake of techniques, when it understands the usefulness of tech­\nniques in all spheres, it moves deliberately to appropriate them.\nIn the past (and to a certain degree today), circumstances led \nthe state to appropriate a given technique. The fortuitous develop­\nment of some political trend, the encounter of technique with the \nstate— these led the state, a bit haphazardly, to adopt a technique. \nBut instances of premeditated action on the part of the state in this \ndirection are beginning to be discernible; for example, the exploita­\ntion of propaganda and atomic research. We must expect this \nmovement to gain greater and greater amplitude, for when the \nstate has once undertaken some action, it generally goes on to the \nend.\nRepercussion* on the State\nThe conjunction of state and technique is not a neutral fact. For \nmany it is not surprising and implies nothing but a growth of state \npower. They ask whether, after all, it is not a good thing that the \nstate perform its functions as well as possible and be well equipped \nto this end. We have indeed known a state which had only a \nlaughable police force, powerless and incapable of checking crimi­\nnals. It is a good thing for technical progress in this sphere to \ncollate all other techniques, thus enabling the state to perform its \nrole of arresting crime. These techniques, when utilized by the \nstate, enable it to restore order, to guarantee certain liberties, and \neven perhaps to master its political destiny. This is how current \nopinion interprets the conjunction of technique and the state. I be-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 4 8 )\nlieve that such attitudes are superficial and inaccurate. Technique, \nin its present state of development, is no longer merely a passive \ninstrument under state control, as it was under the control of cer­\ntain individuals. The question now is what we see when we ex­\namine contemporary facts instead of antiquated principles. \nEvolution. The first consequence of the conjunction of state and \ntechnique is the progressive transformation of the old techniques of \nthe state after they have come in contact with the new techniques—  \nformerly private but now becoming public. When a comparison \nis made between private and public techniques, it is noted that \nprivate techniques are incomparably more efficient. (I have al­\nready indicated certain reasons for this.) To the extent that tech­\nniques remain private, they lie outside the framework of the state. \nWhen they come under state control, however, the question in­\nevitably arises why these techniques should not be incorporated \ninto the traditional framework of the state. But private techniques \nseem to have been created to answer different requirements; they \nhave different dimensions, and this poses a problem. Private meth­\nods are intimately connected with their objectives, and these of- \njectives are of human dimensions. Consequently, they are not \nadaptable to the much more extended needs of the state. This in­\ncompatibility ceases to be true, however, as private business begins \nto assume dimensions equal to and sometimes greater than those \nof the state. It is clear that enterprises such as Citroen or Bata \nare of such dimensions that their administrations are comparable to \nthe administration of the state. Standard Oil has international in­\nterests of such magnitude that its international policy is like that \nof a state. The financial power of the Insurance Trust is such \nthat a parallel can be drawn between its financial system and that \nof a stale. It appears that, starting with a certain critical mass, \nsociological and technical laws are identical for private and public \nenterprises.\nWe may exclude from the technical framework states such as \nLuxembourg and San Marino. And we may soon be forced to ex­\nclude nations which do not prepare themselves quickly enough to \nface up to technical demands, such as Belgium, Holland, and Den­\nmark. These three have already been obliged to combine in order \nto meet modern technical problems. European nations in general \nare being compelled to renounce political sovereignty and form\n\f\nThe Technological Society (*49\nassociations designed to realize certain far-reaching technical op­\nerations, as, for example, research projects in atomic energy (1958), \nthe exploitation of the Sahara (1958), the launching of an artificial \nsatellite (i960). Conversely, we must include in the technical \nframework the great private enterprises, whose technical princi­\nples are identical with those of the state. Indeed, it may be said \nin general that the state lags behind the great corporations in this \nrespect and that it is compelled to modify and rationalize its ad­\nministrative, judicial, and financial systems on the model of the \ngreat commercial and industrial enterprises. This is the point that \nHrant Pasdermaidjan makes in his book about the government of \ngreat organizations. He shows in particular that all administra­\ntions— civil or military, state or industrial— must rest on identical \nprinciples of technical organization if they would be efficient. If \nthese principles are not followed, the administration is condemned \nto being overtaken and passed by private enterprises. In this re­\nspect, France is alarmingly backward. Because our administrative \nand financial system was the world's best a century ago, we care­\nfully persist in maintaining it, whereas the plain truth is that cer­\ntain techniques would guarantee much better results. Even our \nnewly created administrations, such as Social Security, refuse to be \nguided by well-known technical rules. This is not the case in the \nso-called progressive countries, in which the administrative and \nfinancial systems are aligned very rapidly (too rapidly, perhaps, \nwhen the social order is not on the same plane as the technical or­\nganization ) with industrial and commercial techniques.\nThis new organization of administration results in part from the \ncreation of a technique of administration and in part from the in­\ntroduction of the machine into all organizations. The two are re­\nlated, not only because mechanization entails, as I have already \npointed out, a reorganization of administrative units but also be­\ncause mechanization solves the major problem of administration, \nthe problem of paper work. All organizations are founded on paper \nwork. And when paper work transcends human capacities by virtue \nof sheer quantity and complexity, the problem of what to do about \nit arises. The machine is the solution.\nTo get some idea of the magnitude of this mechanization, let us \nconsider the two over-all categories of office machines, accounting \nand statistical. The first category is divided into seven major types\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 5 0 )\nand their subdivisions. The second is divided into four types and \nfourteen species. The operations effected by these machines in­\nvolve a modification of the administrative structure: administra­\ntive tasks must comply with mechanical requirements. Mas says \nthat “the operations cannot be carried out except by breaking them \ndown into homogeneous tasks and functions so that they can be \ncommitted to mechanical organs.” The operations may be grouped \nby cycles as a function of the end sought; or they may be brought \ntogether into a single task combining all operations of the same \ntechnical nature. This last is the so-called functional grouping, \nwhich results in an administration divided into “performance func­\ntion,” “arrangement function,” “interpretation function,” and “con­\ntrol function.” It is easily seen how far removed all this is from \nthe traditional type of office and from the customary division of \nadministrative tasks.\nWhat is true in administration is also true in finances. The tradi­\ntional principles of public accounting, such as the separation of \nthe funcions of comptroller and accountant, the control of monies \npaid out, etc., have clearly been affected. A tremendous leap was \nnecessary for the Cour des Comptes, twenty years in arrears with \nits inspection of finances, to deliver in 1948 the results for 1944 \nand 1945. The guiding principle of finance today is that security \nis sacrificed to speed. Finance no longer represents, as it did in \nthe nineteenth century, the rule, the criterion, and the check. It \nhas become the instrument of an efficient general policy. It must \nnever act as an obstacle to a decision which is technically valid. \nIts traditional role as a check and constraint has been rendered \nquestionable through the adoption of new techniques in imitation \nof private enterprise.\nThe financial regime of a modern state is highly reminiscent of \ncommercial affairs. The rules of accounting are modified by the ap­\nplication of business machines, for example, punched-card ma­\nchines. Here machine intervention directly voids an older ad­\nministrative technique. A certain flexibility is necessary but is \nrarely found in state structures, which are, for various reasons, \nrigid. Nothing less than revolution brings about the adaptation of \npolitical regimes to the technical improvements which have be­\ncome mandatory as a result of private enterprise. This is only a \ncorollary of what I have been saying— namely, that political moti-"

The state is usually unable for doctrinal reasons to revolu­\ntionize the techniques of public finance. But when technical \nprogress makes this revolution mandatory, the state is obliged to \ncapitulate.\nThis is clear enough with respect to army, police, administra­\ntion, and finance, but it is perhaps less clear with respect to law. \nHere is one of the major problems contemporary jurists ought to \nbe considering; but all too often they waste their time in textual \nsubtleties. The judicial regime is simply not adapted to technical \ncivilization, and this is one of the causes of its inefficiency and of \nthe ever greater contempt felt toward i t\nLaw is conceived as a function of a traditional society. It has not \nregistered the essential transformation of the times. Its content is \nexactly what it was three centuries ago. It has experienced only a \nfew fragmentary transformations (such as the corporation)— no \nother attempts at modernization have been made. Nor have form \nand methods varied any more than content. Judicial technique has \nbeen little affected by the techniques that surround us today; had \nit been, it might have gained much in speed and flexibility.\nFaced with this importance of the law, society passes to the oppo­\nsite extreme and burdens administration with everything that is the \nproduct of the times in the judicial sphere. Administration, because \nit is better adapted from the technical point of view, continually \nenlarges its sphere at the expense of the judicial, which remains \ncentered on vanishing problems such as codicils, community re­\nversions, and the like. These last, and all similar problems that are \nthe exclusive concern of our law, are problems that relate to an \nindividualistic society of private property, political stability, and \njudicial subtlety.\nLaw is radically vitiated by its backwardness. We ought to be \nconcerned not only with making laws but with rediscovering judi­\ncial principles that might possibly put into some kind of order the \nconstructions made necessary by modem technique. All the tradi­\ntional legal principles are collapsing; for example, the principle of \nthe nonretroactivity of laws or that of the personality des delits \net des peines. This is not due to the particular evil of our society, \nbut simply to the fact that the law, insofar as it is a system, is not \nadapted to absorb necessary innovations. This is the resistance to\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE35a )\nsocial upheaval of a long-tested and traditional technique. And in \nthe judicial sphere, unlike the others, there is no fund of private \nexperiment to render it more efficient. As I have pointed out, priv­\nate experiment remains the principal source of the advance of \ntechnique, even when technique has passed into the hands of the \nstate.\nAnother striking example of this is found in pedagogy. Educa­\ntional method was stabilized after the state nationalized education \nand adopted the Jesuits’ technique. But the pedagogic movement \ndating from the turn of the century is at present rendering the \nwhole edifice questionable. The older framework was coherent, but \nthe combined technical discoveries of psychologists, physicians, \nand educators have given birth to a new system which is progres­\nsively penetrating the educational milieu. The state is moving in \nthe direction of these discoveries. It has created the so-called new \nclasses, which do not yet correspond exactly to the principles of \nmodern pedagogy but which do represent the first step of integra­\ntion into the body of the state of a method worked out by private \npersons. Once again we see the traditional techniques of the state \nbeing modified by the influence of private techniques, subject to a \ncertain lag and to difficulties that result from the enormity of the \noperations, which concern not a few individuals but millions.\nThe Technical Organism, A second consequence of the penetra­\ntion of the state by techniques is that the state as a whole becomes \nan enormous technical organism. Thus, nationalization of certain \nindustrial plants not only makes the state an industrial “boss” or \ntechnician, but also compels it to revise its techniques of organiza­\ntion and administratioa Indeed, in Great Britain, France, and \neven the United States the dimensions of the newer industrial or­\nganizations of the state far surpass those of private enterprise. We \nare witnessing the creation of technical bureaus of a new character \nand the creation of hitherto unknown types of organizations de­\nsigned to redistribute power internally on the different levels. All \nthis, unbeknown to the public, doubtless produces repercussions \non the structure of the state, the effects of which are decisive but \nwill only make themselves felt some years hence. It may be added \nthat these changes are much more widespread in Great Britain \nthan in France.\nIn order to gain some conception of the full range of techniques\n\f\nThe Technological Society (*53\napplied by the modem state, consider the following enumeration \nof techniques which lie outside the traditional domains already \nexamined:\nIndustrial and commercial techniques of all orders (the state be­\ncoming state-boss to an ever greater degree)\nInsurance and hanking techniques, including social security, \nfamily allotments, and nationalized hanks\nOrganizational techniques, including co-ordinating commissions \namong all services, and new inspection systems \nPsychological techniques, including services of propaganda, vo­\ncational guidance, and psychotechniques \nArtistic techniques, including radio, television, a more or less \nofficial motion-picture industry, city planning, and controlled tour­\nism\nScientific techniques, including the various centers of scientific \nresearch\nPlanning techniques (with arbitrary objectives), including gen­\neral economic planning, transport planning, and city planning \nBiological techniques (already a reality, although rare), includ­\ning human stud-farms, euthanasia, obligatory vaccination and \nmedical inspection, and social assistance \nSociological techniques (for the management of the masses and \nthe study of public opinion)\nEach of these comprises various subsidiary techniques, complex \nmechanisms, and specialized methods. The state, since it applies \nthese methods where necessary, can itself no longer be anything \nother than technical. Persons who become panic-stricken before \nsuch administrative proliferation and aggrandizement of state ac­\ntivities, who criticize social security, for example, because it em­\nploys too many civil servants, who hold that a return to liberalism \nwould suppress this proliferation, show thereby that they have not \nunderstood the development of modern times. No deliberate choice \non the part of the state, no theoretical decision, has brought about \nthis growth of technique; its causes were independent of the per­\nsonal or collective. The modern state could no more be a state \nwithout techniques than a businessman could be a businessman \nwithout the telephone or the automobile. The businessman does \nnot employ these objects because he is particularly enamored of \nprogress. The state does not employ propaganda or planning be-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE254 )\ncause it is socialist The circumstances are such that the state can­\nnot be other than it is. Not only does it need techniques, but tech­\nniques need it  It is not a matter of chance, nor a matter of \nconscious will; rather, it is an urgency which expresses itself in the \ngrowth of the technical apparatus around a rather slight and feeble \n“brain.\" The motive force behind the state does not develop in \nproportion to the state apparatus. This motive force ( theological \ninterpretations aside) is man. And man has no more capacity to \nfunction when he is at the center of the technical organization than \nwhen he is a simple citizen lost in the machinery. In other words, \nthe politician is demoted to minority status by the enormity of the \ntechniques the state has at its disposal The state is no longer the \nPresident of the Republic plus one or more Chambers of Deputies. \nNor is it a dictator with certain all-powerful ministers. It is an \norganization of increasing complexity which puts to work the sum \nof the techniques of the modem world. Theoretically our politi­\ncians are at the center of the machinery, but actually they are being \nprogressively eliminated by it. Our statesmen are impotent satel­\nlites of the machine, which, with all its parts and techniques, ap­\nparently functions as well without them. The state machine is, to \nbe sure, not yet well adjusted, but we are only at the beginning, \nand its adjustment is already good enough to give the unmistakable \nimpression that it will tolerate no outside influence.\nI know there are some who believe the political factor to be \npredominant. These people will cite the sovereign authority of men \nsuch as Stalin, who for political reasons modified the technical or­\nganization by excluding certain techniques and retaining others. \nSome will cite the authority of Hitler, which was exercised for \ndoctrinaire, not technical reasons. In these cases, and in many \nothers, it would seem that politicians make real political decisions \nwhich coerce and determine the technical machinery. Were this \ntrue, the state would not be primarily technical. But we must not \nbe taken in by appearances. Gabriel Ardant has clearly shown that \ntoday the search for efficiency is the law of the state’s administra­\ntions and services. Where purely administrative technique is not \nthe chief goal, government is no longer possible. It is not sufficient \nto improve one or another governmental service, or to create iso­\nlated new organisms. The whole structure and methodology must\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2 5 5\nbe considered; in this process the politician does not count for \nmuch.\nThe Conflict Between the Politicians and the Technicians. The \nintrusion of techniques into the machinery of the state involves the \nconflict of politicians and technicians. “Let the technicians speak” \nis a leitmotiv of all the journals of the opposition. Dardenne, in his \nTrots mots chez les paysans noirs, concludes his African inquiry by \nnoting the necessity of allowing the “era of the technicians to suc­\nceed the era of authoritarian administrators.” He sees in this the \nsolution of all the human problems of the Negro peasantry. For ex­\nample, he contrasts the political decisions of administrators to build \nbarracks and strategic military roads with the technical decisions \nof agronomists and economists to develop the African cotton in­\ndustry and to furnish cheap cotton goods to the natives. But \nDardenne overlooks the fact that the first decision was not made \nby politicians, but technicians: the military. He holds too firmly \nto the idea that technician means engineer. He neglects the tech­\nnical character of both the army and the air force, and sometimes \neven of the administration.\nThis oversight, which is widespread, often leads to a misinter­\npretation of certain well-known conflicts of interest. In 1938 many \npeople insisted that there was hostility between the Nazi Party and \nthe technicians (and even the army). But this “conflict” came to \nnothing, unless it was the attempt on Hitler— which was made in \n1944 after his power had been effectively broken. A. Ciliga and \nStolypine report that a similar situation exists in the Soviet Union. \nAccording to Ciliga, alongside the Communist bureaucracy which \nholds the political power through its mass organizations and labor \nunions, there is a “technical intelligentsia,” the ITR, which is \nstrongly organized and nonpartisan and which has created its own \ncorporative organization. All technicians belong to the ITR, and its \nrole has become more important in proportion as the economic \nstructure is increasingly based on the activities of technicians. The \nfive-year plan implies a technical framework without parallel. An \nalleged conflict exists between the Communist Party and the ITR; \nthe ITR seeks to turn out the Party on the grounds that the Party \n(a) hampers technical development, (b) provokes discontent \namong the workers, and (c) intrudes into its decisions certain\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*56)\nmotives which the technicians cannot accept. R is possible that \nsuch a conflict exists. Certain signs suggest it The Communist \nParty’s fear of the saboteur is doubtless not just propaganda. But \nthere are not enough signs to enable us to form a judgment.\nMoltchanowski presents another aspect of this alleged conflict. He \nwrites of a class of very bureaucratic and backward technicians, \nincapable of modifying their methods to adapt them to technical \ndevelopments. Preoccupied with the realization of the plan, they \nignorantly increase the number of workers or the hours of work, \ninstead of increasing efficiency. The insistence on the old methods \nof work paralyzes the new mechanical means and diminishes yield \neven further in view of the magnitude of the labor force employed \nin the upkeep of equipment. The problem then becomes: Who \nought to take responsibility for adapting the worker to the ma­\nchine? Who is to educate the worker? The answer is: the local \nbranches of the Communist Party.\nThe complexity of the elements of this conflict is evident; and \nit is difficult to accept without reservation the image of the tech­\nnician-archangel sallying forth to do battle with the megalomaniac \nand rotten politician. Nevertheless, it is probable that in the Soviet \nUnion, as in Nazi Germany, there is a conflict between the two \nclasses. But this conflict cannot be counted (hi to bring about a \nchange in the regime. As C. Wright Mills has shown, the managers \nunder any regime whatsoever are never anything but executive \nagents. They are never in a position, publicly or institutionally, to \nassert themselves against their masters. Conversely, the masters \nbecome totally powerless without the complex (and secretly all- \npowerful) managerial cadre.\nIn democratic regimes, there is indeed a conflict between politi­\ncian and technician, but it is apparently much less acute. Two \nquestions arise. First, how does it come about that the conflict is \ngreater in the dictatorships? Second, how does it come about that \nthe technicians do not take the upper hand in a democracy and \noverwhelm the politicians, who possess no serious means of resist­\nance? The answer to the second question enables us to dispose once \nand for all of the idea that there is a natural and inevitable hostility \nbetween politicians and technicians. As for the first question, there \nis an easy reply: in a dictatorship the politician is more demanding \nand makes his weight felt more heavily, so that the technicians find\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 2 5 7\nhis decisions rather difficult to tolerate. But then how to explain \nthe fact that dictatorships make the most of the technician, sub­\nmitting everything to his judgment and integrating everything into \nthe technical system? How to explain the fact that the ITR takes \nits meaning from the five-year plan, the plan itself being a product \nof politicians? How to explain the prodigious technical rise of the \nSoviet Union and Nazi Germany under the sway of the politicians? \nThe orientation of both these regimes was technical. Why do the \ntechnicians complain?\nThe answer is that the conflict is not between politicians and \ntechnicians but among technicians of different categories. In the \ndictatorships, the politician aims, successfully or unsuccessfully, to \ncomply with the demands of a political technique. In democratic \nsystems, the politician complies only with the requirements of a \ntechnique for getting himself elected; he has an altogether inade­\nquate grasp of the various technical services. He has no direct \nrelation to any of the innumerable technical activities. The politi­\ncian in a dictatorial system, on the other hand, tends to become a \ntechnician and ipso facto collides with other techniques.\nThe new political technique claims to be concerned with aU \ntechniques, indeed to effect a synthesis among them. Synthesis is \nvery likely its real function. But synthesis cannot be achieved at \nthe first attempt, and the claim is not easily accepted by the other \ntechnicians. We are witnessing a crisis of adaptation. Political \ntechnique is far from realization; it is only in its first stammering \nstages. Yet it claims to be the science of synthesis, as did theology \nin the Middle Ages or philosophy in the eighteenth century. When \nthe engineer protests against the politician’s decisions, he may be \njustified on the grounds that the politician is deceiving himself and \nin reality is quite ignorant. But the engineer may also be ignorant \nof the technical motives behind the politician’s decision; the en­\ngineer has no conception of the elements necessary to judge politi­\ncal technique on the plane of synthesis. This is indeed a crisis of \nadaptation; but precisely because adaptation is involved, the con­\nflict does not lead to the overthrow of the regime.\nA similar crisis, practically speaking, does not exist in democratic \nsystems where the attempt to form a political technique has just \nbegun. The English, however, have wanted for a long time to in­\ntroduce technique into governmental operations and thus to resolve\n\f\nas8 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nconflicts between politicians and technicians before they become \nacute. Since the eighteenth century the English have been pre­\noccupied with the technique of lawmaking. In the nineteenth cen­\ntury, with Arthur Seymonds and Bellanden Ken, their express goal \nwas the rationalization and systematization of legislative opera­\ntions. Their motto was: Codification, Consolidation, Purification. \nTheir technical reforms resulted in the creation of offices for the \ntechnical editing of legal projects, in uniformity of method, in the \nuse of marginal notes, and in the editing of resumes and tables. \nThis effort has been resumed in the last few years in Great Britain \non the ministerial level; to be able to compete with the techni­\ncians, the politicians have undertaken governmental reorganization \non the Cabinet level, with a view to greater efficiency. They have \ndivided up their work systematically by developing numerous so- \ncalled “standing committees,” each of which has its rigorously de­\nfined specialty. The co-ordination of these committees is assured \nby the Cabinet Office, an organ of great originality. The cabinet \noffice consists of a small group of highly trained civil servants under \nthe direction of a permanent secretary. Its function is to prepare \nthe agenda of the Cabinet and its committees and to take minutes \nof the meetings. It is interesting to note that the importance of this \noffice is growing. The technical function which it assumes gives \nit a kind of supremacy over the whole political complex.\nSimilarly, the United States has shown a desire to establish a \ntruly independent corps of political technicians as opposed to poli­\nticians, and to separate completely the political organ of decision \nfrom the technical organ of preparation. The task of the expert is to \nfurnish the politician with information and estimates on which he \ncan base a decision. A clearly defined division of responsibility \ncorresponds to this functional division: that is, the expert has no \nresponsibility. The problem is, above all else, to maintain the in­\ndependence of the technician; he must avoid pressures, involve­\nment in contests of influence, and the personal quarrels of the \nmembers of the administration. When the technician has completed \nhis task, he indicates to the politicians the possible solutions and \nthe probable consequences— and retires.\nUnfortunately, the Americans do not consider the inverse prob­\nlem, which is, objectively speaking, becoming more important \nWhen the expert has effectively performed his task of pointing out\n\f\nThe Techndogicd Society (2 5 9\nthe necessary ways and means, there is generally only one logical \nand admissible solution. The politician will then find himself \nobliged to choose between the technician’s solution, which is the \nonly reasonable one, and other solutions, which he can indeed try \nout at his own peril but which are not reasonable. At such a moment \nthe politician is gambling with his responsibility since there are \nsuch great chances of miscarriage if he adopts technically deviant \nsolutions. In fact, the politician no longer has any real choice; deci­\nsion follows automatically from the preparatory technical labors. \nJungle even claims that in the United States, on very advanced \ntechnical levels, unchallengeable decisions have already been \nmade by “electronic brains” in the service of the National Bureau \nof Standards; for example, by the EAC, sumamed the “Washington \nOracle.” The EAC is said to have been the machine which made \nthe decision to recall General MacArthur after it had solved equa­\ntions containing all the strategic and economic variables of his \nplan. This example, which must be given with all possible reserva­\ntions, is confirmed by the fact that the American government has \nsubmitted to such computing devices a large number of economic \nproblems that border on the political. Even admitting that we are \nnot yet at this stage, we must recognize that every advance made \nin the techniques of inquiry, administration, and organization in \nitself reduces the power and the role of politics.\nConsequently, the opposition between technicians and politi­\ncians places the politician squarely before a truly decisive di­\nlemma. Either the politician will remain what he is in a democracy, \nin which case his role is fated to become less and less important in \ncomparison to the role of technicians of all sorts ( a state of affairs \nalready evident in the financial sphere); or the politician will take \nthe road of political technique, in which case the crisis of adapta­\ntion will inevitably arise. If the politician really wishes to continue \nto exist, he must choose the second solution as the only possible \none. The existence of techniques in all other spheres forces him to \nthis choice. Even so, little by little he is being stripped of any real \npower and reduced to the role of a figurehead. These tech­\nniques entail for him both the possibility and the obligation to \ndevolve a political technique. This does not mean dictatorship, \nwhich is a provisional, trial form. It means, as we shall see, an \ninevitable and radical transformation of the political perspective,"

    "raw_text": "TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE260 )\nThe Nazi dictatorship and Stalin’s regime ought not to be com­\npletely identified. I have already stated that Lenin was the first \nman to create a political technique. For Lenin— and Stalin under­\nstood this in a remarkable way— the politician was neither a \ntheoretician nor a chief of state in the traditional sense, but a \ntechnician.\nLenin’s concept makes politics a technique like the others, but \nactually superior to them since it is basically charged with co­\nordinating the other spheres of activity. Political decisions are \ntaken by virtue of technical motives, and it is this fact which dif­\nferentiates this kind of politics both from the purely doctrinaire \nCommunism of the left and from the older opportunism that makes \nits decisions on the basis of subjective motives, impressions, and \nreasonings bearing on the immediate situation and varying with \ncircumstance. When Stalin modified a given organization or \nchanged the content of a plan, he did so not underpressure of facts \nbut as a function of facts, by applying a precise technique. Of \ncourse, it is possible to apply the technique badly; certain errors \nmay persist because the technique has not yet been fully de­\nveloped. But the important thing is that the politician is forced to \nfollow the line laid down by the technician. This is the tendency \nwhich has become classical in Communism. According to this \ntendency, Marxism is not a doctrine but a method, a method of \nthought as well as of action. This political technique is not well \nunderstood and may not even be recognized— above all because \nits ends are not clear. Is it directed toward Communism as a whole? \nOr must the distinction be made, with Lenin, between strategy \n(which is indeed directed toward Communism) and tactics (rep­\nresenting the more specifically technical part, in which immediate \npolitical problems are resolved in relation to strategy). Tactical \ndecisions are all made rationally to satisfy all possible technical \ndata arising from all co-ordinative bureaus and organisms. The \ndistinction between strategy and tactics enables us to understand \nthe most sensational zigzags of the party line; for example, the 1937 \nstand against the older Communism, the 1940 pact with Nazism, \nthe admission in 1943 of the Church into the Communist frame­\nwork, the 1947 stand against “formalism,” that of 1949 against the \nauthors of the plan. These tactical changes can all be explained on \nthe basis of technical reasons of great precision; they do not repre-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (261\nsent arbitrary decisions of hard-pressed politicians. The growing \ninfluence of technicians was further emphasized in 1953 by the \nselection of five technicians to be the five vice-presidents of the \nCouncil of Ministers.\nThe problem, posed by Hitlerism was very different. Hitler was \na politician who made his decisions without the advice of techni­\ncians, and often even despite their advice. His decisions were moti­\nvated by subjective, internally generated impulses. This attitude \nwas the more extraordinary in that the Nazi apparatus appeared \nto be among those which had best understood and applied the \nfusion between state and technique. It utilized all techniques to the \nmaximum possible degree, reducing them unconditionally to its \nservice, with the exception of the borderline case of politics. Even \nso, it is not always correct to assume that politics intervened hap­\nhazardly. Very often, the firmest doctrines of Nazism had to \nyield to technical necessities. Thus, the Nazi propaganda tech­\nnique twice resorted to actions which were publicly popular but \nwhich were at the same time completely contrary to Nazi doctrine. \nOne such instance was the great propaganda drive of 1935, at the \ntime ot the \"confirmation” plebiscite: \"We are more democratic \nthan the democracies.” The plebiscite was intended to show that \nthe Fiihrer was the true incarnation of the people and that, conse­\nquently, the Nazi regime was a real democracy, not an artificial \none, as France’s was. The second instance was the great propa­\nganda campaign in behalf of liberty: “We are defending the \nliberty of European man.” These two themes, widely used but \nformally opposed to the Hitler doctrine, arose from the technical \nnecessities of propaganda. It is also known that the financial tech­\nnique of the Nazis often led them to act contrary to doctrine; for \nexample, in the case of Jews who were made \"honorary Aryans,” \nor in the case of certain capitalists who became mainstays of the \nregime and were integrated into the financial organism of the \nThird Reich. However, the personal political decisions of Hitler \nfrequently did upset the techniques of the state. The conflict was \nparticularly keen between Hider and the general staff; but it also \nexisted with the Geheim Polizei and with the organs of foreign \ntrade. Hitler ordered the adoption of certain measures the tech­\nnicians disapproved, and after the fall of Nazism, they blamed \nevery difficulty and misfortune on these arbitrary decisions. In any"

    "raw_text": "262 )  TECHNIQUE AND TH E STATE\ncase, it can certainly be said that the majority of Hitler's personal \ndecisions were unfortunate, notably from the military point of \nview.\nIt is clear that the future belongs not to Hitler’s kind of political \naction but to Stalin’s. Some important political chieftains may still \nbypass these techniques; but their situation appears more and more \nprecarious.\nIn the conflict between politician and technician, corruption is \na much more serious matter. Political milieus are very generally \ncorrupt The fact is indisputable, both in democratic regimes such \nas France and the United States and in authoritarian systems such \nas Fascism, Francoism, and Nazism. We cannot really speak about \nthe Soviet Union. The vertigo of power and the opportunity to \nbecome rich corrupt politicians very quickly. To the degree that \nthe state becomes more and more technical, there is increasing \ncontact between politicians and technicians. Though technique \ntends more and more to have primacy over politics, and technical \ndecisions seem unassailable by parliaments, the takeover of tech­\nnique Can be arrested by corruption. The technician is a man, and \nin contact with corrupt men he may well allow himself to be cor­\nrupted. He can sidetrack his technique, annul the decisions de­\nmanded by its strict application, and grant some favor or special \nprivilege which perverts technical action. In such an instance, \ngeneral interests (the only true objects of politics) no longer con­\ntrol technique; particular interests (which are much more efficient \nin checking technical action) do. Pure technique represents the \ngeneral interests, the true politics, and is opposed to the politician \nwho represents the corrupting element for private, and hence \npolitically nonexistent, reasons. The corruption of politicians is the \nonly factor which can retard the total transformation of the state \ninto a gigantic, exclusively technical apparatus. Even so, the im­\npetus of this movement of transformation is being intensified; and \npublic opinion is oriented towards its success. Public opinion, which \ncounts for a great deal even in authoritarian regimes, is almost \nunanimously favorable to technical decisions as opposed to politi­\ncal ones, which are usually described as either “partisan” or “ideal­\nistic.” One of the current reproaches made against politics is that \nit fetters the normal activity of techniques, which the public gen­\nerally considers good in themselves. Citizens become angry, for\n\f\nTheTechnologicalSociety ( 263\nexample, when they see the state holding back the development of \naviation. In case of a conflict between politician and technician, the \ntechnician has public opinion behind him. A characteristic instance \nwas furnished by Spain. Spanish Fascism ought clearly to have \nbeen censured by the democracies in 1945, as was Italian Fascism. \nThere were political, sentimental, and doctrinal reasons for doing \nso. But the military technicians proclaimed that this would be a \ndisaster, and the economic technicians agreed. The United States \nand Great Britain let Franco survive, and France was ridiculed \nfor closing the frontier. Public opinion, which, particularly after \nig44, was sharply anti-Fascist, ought to have reacted favorably to \nthis action of the French government. Indeed, the first impulse \nwas to condemn Spain. But after the technicians had shown that \nsuch a move would be harmful economically and financially (on \nthe plane of foreign commerce), public opinion began to shift. A \ncallous comparison was made between an ideological action, a \nnoble gesture which yielded nothing, and the judgment of the \ntechnicians, who were demonstrating the stupidity of such an \nideology. Public opinion wavered for a time, only to turn, after \nabout six months, in the direction of the technicians.\nCan it be said that this was a matter of personal interest? The \noverwhelming majority of Frenchmen had no direct interest in the \nmatter; yet, it ought not to be forgotten that adherence to a tech­\nnical decision is always a matter of personal interest. As for the \ntechnicians, it may be asked why they made the judgment they \ndid. Clearly because they were applying their technical instru­\nment, in which generous or sentimental motives had no place. The \ntechnicians as technicians told us that the closing of the frontier \nwas disastrous; as men, they might have approved of the action \nfor ideological reasons. It is not at all certain that technicians are \nstill capable of making humane judgments; that, however, is an­\nother question.\nThe transformation of the state and the consequent predomi­\nnance of technicians involves two elements. First, the technician \nconsiders the nation very differently from the politician. For the \ntechnician, the nation is essentially an affair to be managed, for \n(righdy) he remains imbued with the private origin of technique; \nas a consequence, the private and the public spheres are poorly \ndelimited. All that the technician can take into account is the ap-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE264)\nplication of his instruments— whether in the service of the state or \nof something else is of small importance. For him, the state is not \nthe expression of popular will, or a creation of God, or the essence \nof humanity, or a modality of the class war. It is an enterprise with \ncertain services which ought to function properly. It is an enter­\nprise which ought to be profitable, yield a maximum of efficiency, \nand have the nation for its working capital.\nThe influence of the technician on the state does not reside solely \nin the conditions he imposes through his administrative decisions \nor in the schema of good organization he draws up. It resides also \nin the judgments he makes concerning governmental and adminis­\ntrative efficiency. I have discussed the transformation of the system \nof public accounting. A new and remarkable example of this is \nfurnished by the Netherlands. The problem there is to evaluate the \nefficiency of governmental services as a function of their cost \nprices. Every organization, we are told, must in principle establish \na valid relation among men, ends, and means in respect to their \nproductive efficiency. Productivity, which seemed heretofore to be \na purely economic concept, has made its appearance in the last \nfew years in the political framework. It is necessary to evaluate \nthe cost of every administrative operation and to apply the law of \nmarginal yield. Funds are assigned to each department on the \nbasis of a standard cost established through service. By introducing \nmodern double-entry bookkeeping, it is possible to carry out a \nconstant inspection of activities on every level and to establish the \nrelation between actual and standard expenses. In this way, the \nlaw of the technician transforms the administrative perspective. \nEvery administration becomes an object, as formerly the worker \nbecame an object in Taylor’s hands. Politics assigns the goal; but \nthe technician dictates the means to the last dot. We have a detailed \ndescription of this orientation in Gabriel Ardant’sbook.\nThe entire administration is only a machine whose operations \nmust become more and more rigorous. In this way, that ideal theo­\nretical situation is attained in which, to use the words of James K. \nFeely, Jr, the “margin of chance between intention and realization* \nis almost nil. For, according to Feely, the smaller this margin be­\ncomes, the more a check on execution appears possible, and the \nmore the coefficient of predictability is increased. Such a situation \nwould give maximum security in all the different administrative\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 265\nunits, and what Feely proposed as a theoretical ideal becomes prac­\ntical. The only price tag on its attainment is the conversion of the \nadministration into an apparatus, the civil servants into objects, \nand the nation into a supplier of working capital.\nThe nation becomes the object of the technical state in that it \nfurnishes all the different kinds of material substratum: men, \nmoney, economy, and so on. The state becomes a machine de­\nsigned to exploit the means of the nation. The relation between \nstate and nation is henceforth completely different from what it \nhad been before. The nation is no longer primarily a human, geo­\ngraphic, and historical entity. It is an economic power whose re­\nsources must be put to work, and to which a “yield” must be re­\nturned. In connection with this yield, the older technicians used \nthe term maximum but the newer ones use the term optimum. \nMaximum yield is yield that exhausts and debases the resources \nof the state in a short interval of time; optimum yield is yield that \nattempts to safeguard substance and vitality, the typical example \nbeing the TVA. However this may be, we must regard the nation \nas an entity whose total resources are to be brought into action \nprecisely because all the different techniques, mutually condition­\ning one another, have come into play. Once the technician has \ncommenced his operations, he cannot recognize any limits. He \ncannot esteem or respect anything in the nation except the “nature \nof things.” This promotes the greater coherence of the state-nation \nwhich is so characteristic of our times.\nWhat is true on the national level is also true on the level of \ninternational organization. In view of the radical setbacks experi­\nenced by the political organisms designed to foster international \nagreement, it was decided to entrust further exploration along these \nlines to a group of technicians. It was believed that international \nconsideration of the areas to be exploited, rather than purely na­\ntional interests, would be more propitious to an entente. Thus, in \n1949 a great assemblage consisting of 550 scientists and technicians \nopened its deliberations at Lake Success to consider how best to \nexploit the world’s natural resources. International projects of this \nkind are much less advanced than similar intranational projects, \nand the reactions of politicians to the technicians are correspond­\ningly more enthusiastic. This was evident at the 1949 Strasbourg \nassembly of the Organisation Europ6enne de Cooperation fico-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 6 6 )\nnomique, a purely technical group. The Americans were of the \nopinion that this organization did not progress as quickly as the \ntechnical situation permitted. We are witnesses at the inception, \non the international level, of the same \"takeover” by the technicians \nwhich we have already observed on the national level.\nThe second element implied in the transformation of the state \nand the predominance of the technician is the progressive suppres­\nsion of ideological and moral barriers to technical progress. The \nold techniques of the state were a compound of purely technical \nelements and moral elements such as justice. The moral elements \nare not completely negligible even today, although they by no \nmeans occupy the place of honor accorded them in official dis­\ncourse. The techniques employed by private persons are usually \ntechniques in a pure state, and contain no admixture of moral ele­\nments. (We shall see later on that this is no random fact, but the \nresult of the very nature of technique.) The state is charged not \nonly with maintaining respect for law and order but also with \nestablishing just relations among its citizens. It therefore imposes \nlimits on the pure technique of private persons. Thus, from the \nbeginning, the liberal state forbade the free manufacture of ex­\nplosives and substances pernicious to health. On a higher plane, it \nstruggled by means of antitrust laws (as in The United States) \nagainst the trust, an economic organization notorious for social \ninjustice. It also established labor legislation limiting the abuse of \nthe workers by mechanical techniques. In the area of justice, the \nstate has been a barrier and a check against private technical \nabuses. But when technique became state technique, when techni­\ncal instrumentalities passed into the hands of the state, did the \nstate adhere to its old wisdom? Experience must answer in the \nnegative. The techniques, to which the state opposed checks when \nthey were in the hands of private persons, become unchecked for \nthe state itself. There is no self-limitation in this respect.\nThe English state forbade traffic in narcotics but made wide use \nof them in India and China. An omnipotent state, Fascist or Com­\nmunist, ceases to respect laws made for the protection of labor. \n(The Communist state proclaims this to be a provisional solution \npending the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat; \nbut we can make no judgment of future events.) This is not merely\n\f\nThe Technological Society (267\na case of princeps legibus solutus est3 but something much more \nprofound. The state is the only barrier between men and the \ntechniques of individuals, but it ceases to be a barrier when tech­\nnique, increasing geometrically, encounters the ancient raison \nd’etat.3 This last, which perhaps has nothing to do with the nature \nof the state, has nevertheless existed almost continuously through- ' \nout history. But the raison detat never possessed the means to \nexpress itself. It operated sporadically and incoherently and its \ndecisions often miscarried. It remained more an intention than a \nreality but was always latently there. Primarily, it represented the \njustification by the state of itself. It was the negation of morality \nby the state. But the means at the disposal of the state were them­\nselves subject to a strong moral influence. They were consequently \nneither technically nor morally adapted to the raison d’etat, which \nwas deprived of any force without these arms.\nThe French Parliament under absolute monarchy, or the French \nadministration under the Restoration, for example, were not \nadapted to this objective. But when new techniques refined the \nold ones, the old ones lost their internal curbs. The state then found \nitself in possession of means agreeable to the raison d’etat. As soon \nas it had these means, it applied them without hesitation because \nit entertained no doubts at all as to the excellence of its ends. At \nthe same time other techniques, the result of the activity of indi­\nviduals and until then restrained by the state, came into the hands \nof the state, which well understood their usefulness for realizing \nits constant objective. How could the state be expected not to \nexploit a judiciary without independence and a police without any \nfaculty of judgment? But the most noteworthy fact in this compli­\ncated development is that henceforth the raison d'etat could only \nbe the expression of the multiplicity of techniques which it had \nemployed to realize itself.\nTechnique and Constitution. French administration remained, un­\ntil about 1940, as Napoleon had created it in 1800. It had, of \ncourse, undergone certain modifications in detail; there had even \nbeen certain reversions to pre-Napoleonic practices.

There is no doubt that one of the gravest prob­\nlems of the Third Republic, if one seldom explicitly considered, \nwas that an administration created by and for an authoritarian \nstate should be in the service of a state which wished to be thought \nliberal. This is the situation of the state today in all areas. Only \nwith difficulty can the technical apparatus be varied; only with \ndifficulty can it be employed in one way rather than in another.\nTo take a simple example: it matters little, in driving an automo­\nbile, whether the regime be republican or Fascist. Techniques are \nbecoming less and less material, and really important differences \nfrom state to state tend to fade progressively away. A given state \ntechnique must be exercised on its own terms, though the political \nopinions of successive ministers differ. This continuity can be ex­\npressed in terms of the dictatorship of bureaus. It explains the \noften-noted fact that socialist ministers, once in power, act in all \ncountries very much as did their nonsocialist predecessors. This \nis the result not of so-called Marxist treachery or of weakness of \ncharacter, but of the specific weight of techniques. Ardant, in his \nbook on the technique of the state, emphasizes that there is a tech­\nnique of state that no regime, whatever its nature, can do without.\nEvery statesman is faced with the dilemma, either he must apply \nthese techniques on their own invariable terms, or he must re­\nnounce them and forego the results they tend to produce. We \nmust not lose sight of the fact that techniques furnish the best \npossible means, each in its own sphere. A country's economic min­\nister will be forced to plan the economy or abandon it to anarchy. \nWe have already studied the unfeasibility of a half-planned econ­\nomy or of planning which contents itself with making recommenda­\ntions. Technique will not tolerate half measures.\nWhat is true of a political personality— a minister, for example—  \nis in part true of a political regime. It makes little difference \nwhether or not the constitution provides for a separation of powers, \nfor one or more chamber, or for a democracy on the model of East \nor of West. From the technical point of view the results will be \nvery nearly the same. Any type of administration other than that\n\f\nThe Technological Society (189\nwhich is technically the most efficient is impossible. A  different \nfinancial regime is also an impossibility. In the case of taxes, for \nexample, it is said that a rightist regime will favor indirect taxes \nthat bear hardest on the general population because this popula­\ntion represents the \"masses,” but that a socializing regime will \nfavor direct taxes that bear hardest on the great fortunes. This only \nshows that a scientific tax technique is not being applied. It seems \nincontestable that such a rigorous technique, in view of the yields \nit can produce, will in the end carry the day. There is an optimum \ntax structure which can be completely determined. It gives the best \nyield to the state, and at the same time equalizes the fortunes of \nthe citizens and saves the fiscal substance. There is no valid reason \nfor not implementing it. This optimal system is making headway \nin all states and is gradually overcoming the associated and ad­\nventitious ideological motives.\nIn the same way, planning imposes itself little by little on every \nregime. It is ideologically puerile to profess to see differences be­\ntween Soviet and Nazi planning. Planning is not reserved to au­\nthoritarian states. Democratic states which tend toward socialism, \nsuch as France or Britain after 1945, or nonsocializing democratic \nstates such as Denmark, today employ the system of planning. \nEven states which are completely liberal, such as South Africa, are \nengaged in planning. This does not mean that the whole economy \nis necessarily planned; it means that the technique of planning is \nmaking headway even in political systems unfavorable to it  \nWhether it is a question of an immigration plan, an export plan, a \ntransport plan, or a city-planning operation, the same technique \nis involved.\nPlanning is being extended to all domains of political life as well \nas to all state regimes. In 1951, Chancellor Adenauer declared \nthat German youth had not responded to the efforts of the regime, \nthat the youth were anarchic and disorganized, that it was impos­\nsible to have any hopes for them, and that planning represented \nthe sole means of reintegrating this wayward youth into the Ger­\nman community. He announced that a German Youth Plan was \nbeing elaborated to cope with the necessity of bringing youth into \nrigid organizations, giving youth an ideal and a collective soul, \ndiscipline and a fixed way of life. Adenauer went on to say that \nall this had to be planned. In a way, he was suggesting a return"

In 1956 it planned youth or­\nganizations, and in i960 sports. It is to be noted that planning is \nbecoming more and more widespread in the United States, where \nthere is a tendency to apply it not only to economic problems but \nalso to social (for example, city planning) and political questions. \nIndeed, American planning is becoming a basic element; it is no \nlonger an accidental fact or a mere adjunct. In the United States \nthere are nearly two thousand planning organisms in the service \nof the various states, not to mention national organisms, some of \nwhich are public (The Council of Economic Advisors) and some \nprivate (The National Planning Association).\nWe must not lose sight o f the fact that nations are more and \nmore closely connected. Moreover, when one nation engages in \nplanning, there is an inevitable repercussion on the others; they are \nmore or less obliged to engage in planning too. And the planning \nof one element implies first the understanding, then the mastery of \nmany others, and little by little the planning of these others. It is \nnot possible to establish a plan for a small comer of the economy \nand permit all the rest of the economy to remain free. Gaston \nBardet has shown that good city planning requires the mobiliza­\ntion of the entire economy. Then, it will be said, the best thing is \nnot to do any city planning at all. But planning cannot possibly \nbe avoided; the explosive increase in t^e population means that \nno one will have any living space unless the area at our disposal \nis organized rationally. Moreover, certain inconveniences of urban \nlife are daily becoming more serious; for example, traffic density, \nair pollution, and excessive noise. None of these problems can be \neffectively resolved except by means of a truly regulative plan. \nIn the last few years, numerous medical and administrative con­\ngresses have of necessity been concerned with this cluster of prob­\nlems.\nSimilar problems are raised by immigration. No country is today \nin a position to allow free movement in or out: free movement \nwould result in excessive population displacement in the direction \nof countries with high wages or political stability. Conversely, \ncountries with dictatorial regimes would see their populations \ndwindle, a state of affairs they would not welcome since it means \ndiminution of power.

What is to be done? Put a complete stop to \npopulation displacement? Such a solution is neither possible nor \ndesirable for reasons of manpower and colonization. But this pre­\nsupposes a plan for immigration, subject moreover to international \nagreement. Immigration planning will be identical whether we \nhave to do with a dictatorship or a democracy. It will require \nidentical police, economic, and administrative mechanisms. Present- \nday democracies cannot escape these technical necessities.\nThese examples help us grasp the fact that the structures of the \nmodem state and its organs of government are subordinate to the \ntechniques dependent on the state. If u>e were to consider in turn \neach of die indispensable services of the modem state, we would \nfind that they are becoming more and more alike, regardless of the \ntheories of government under which they operate. We must insist \non the more and more; the final identity has not yet been achieved. \nThere is no greater similarity among the techniques of the state \nthan among mechanical techniques.

When society did not have \nconstantly to appeal to the state, when problems of all kinds were \nnot as numerous or acute as they are today, the state was relatively \nfree with respect to its instruments. In spite of all the worthy per­\nsons who reassure themselves by saying that all historical epochs \nare alike, that the crises of the fourth century resembled those of \nthe ninth, and so on, the fact is that no one ever before saw world \neconomies, world wars, or world and national populations which, \non the average, double every forty-five years. The state is no longer \nin a position to reject the most efficient means possible. Its prob­\nlems are more difficult and complicated than any ever encountered \nbefore. If the state desires to have an effect on society ( and it has \nno alternative), there is only one way to have this effect. Parlia­\nmentary discussions, the hesitance of theoreticians, the protesta­\ntions of humanists, democratic elections— all of these signify very \nlittle. The state has no more real choice than the worker on the\n\f\ntJ2 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nassembly line; it is led to the technical society by the very terms \nof the problem.\nLet us consider two examples. The concentration camp is gen­\nerally taken as characteristic of dictatorial and Fascistic regimes. \nSuch institutions undeniably exist in the Soviet Union, Poland, and \nBulgaria. But they existed in France under the Third Republic and \nin England during the Boer War. We must not be misled by dif­\nferences in name. Work camps, re-education camps, refugee camps \n— all represent the same fact. And we are only too aware of how \nimportant the use of concentration camps was in Algeria. We are \nspeaking here of the concentration camp in its pure form, which \nhas nothing to do with crematoria or hanging up the inmates by \nthe thumbs. Such tortures are imputable to men, not to technique. \nThe camp as an institution is making its appearance everywhere, \nunder the most varied political regimes, as a result of the conjunc­\ntion of social problems and police technique. The terms of the \nproblem can be enumerated in this way; given the nationalistic \norganization and conversely the existence of fifth columns, given \nthe administrative character of the supervision of territory and the \npopulation expansion, it is absolutely necessary to establish a police \npower based not on individuals but on categories of individuals. \nThere is no way of escaping the establishment of police power by \ncategories— which implies, for example, preventive arrest, con­\ncentration of masses of innocent persons not for judging but for \nsorting, and so forth. To effect sorting and checking operations, \nhighly perfected systems have been developed, as, for example, \nthe MVD in the Soviet Union, the FBI in the United States, and \nthe CIC in occupied Germany. Such systems, obviously, often re­\nquire a considerable length of time for their operations. Suspects \nmay be detained for years before the system finishes its investiga­\ntions. Its precision and rigor cause it to move slowly. The technical \nsystem of concentration camps has proved so efficient and satis­\nfactory to the state that it is increasingly being incorporated into \nour society. It no longer represents the activity of aberrant dicta­\ntors, but rather the activity of every good administrator.\nThe concentration-camp system of today is closely linked to the \nnationalistic state. But it fits so well into administrative systems in \ngeneral that there is no chance of its disappearing, even if the \nnationalistic structure of the modern world were to change. Certain"

    "raw_text": "TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 7 4 )\nBut the facts lead us further. State constitutions do not alter the \nuse of techniques, but techniques do act rather rapidly on state \nstructures. They subvert democracy and tend to create a new \naristocracy. Almost all sociologists are in agreement here; it is suffi­\ncient to refer to the writings of Georges Friedmann to be con­\nvinced of the unanimity which exists on this point even among \nsociologists with the most pronouncedly democratic and socialist \nleanings. Political equality becomes a myth— unattainable through \nthe agency of technique. On the contrary, technique, to an ever \ngreater degree, produces on the technical level a majority of serv­\nants and a minority of governors. Friedmann has studied the matter \nscientifically and has shown in a completely nonpartisan way that \nthe worker-slaves are reduced to the lowest possible human \nvalue when their functions are specialized to completely particular \ntasks. We see in this phenomenon of specialization what technique \nmakes of man in the aggregate. For example, the precision of police \nmechanisms makes it possible to train a good policeman in a few \nweeks. But the man so trained has no knowledge at all of the \ntechniques within which he works. Men are shifted unceasingly \nfrom job to job, never attaining a true calling; they are vocationally \ndowngraded by technique. But a vocation is a major part of life \nand culture. Under these circumstances, even a pervasive culture \nrapidly disappears.\nWe must also consider the influence of agricultural techniques \nwhich result in the exhaustion of certain types of soils while medi­\ncal techniques lead to overpopulation. The interaction of these two \nfactors brings about the creation of masses of underdeveloped hu­\nman beings who are considered by some as unfit for democracy \nbecause they are ineanahle of reacting with the necessary speed \nto the problems of life.\nIn contrast to this mob there is a limited elite that understands \nthe secrets of their own techniques, but not necessarily of all tech­\nniques. These men are close to the seat of modem governmental \npower. The state is no longer founded on the “average citizen” but \non the ability and knowledge of this elite The average man is al­\ntogether unable to penetrate technical secrets or governmental or­\nganization and consequently can exert no influence at all on the \nstate.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (275\nFriedmann, in order to do something constructive about this \ndowngraded and overspecialized manpower, has put his hopes in \nthe evolution of socialism, which, by giving man the feeling of \nsocialist brotherhood and the consciousness of working for the \ncommon good, would give him pleasure in his work. But this psy­\nchological remedy (whose value I am not trying to deny) could \ndo nothing at all to bridge the gap between the intellectual in­\ncapacity of the mob of specialized workers on the one hand and \nthe monopoly of technical means by a technical elite on the other. \nThe new elite is an elite even when it is popular with the people. \nThis split is obvious in all domains. For example, in the administra­\ntive domain, the intervention of a technique of organization and \nmechanization results in the creation, as Mas puts it, “of two classes \nvery far removed from one another. The first, numerically small, \nunderstands the means to conceive, organize, direct and control; \nthe second, infinitely more numerous, is composed of mere execu­\ntants . . .” The latter are hacks who understand nothing of the \ncomplicated techniques they are carrying out It is not conceivable \nthat the normal operation of democracy would be acceptable to \nthose who exercise this technical monopoly— which, moreover, is \na hidden monopoly in the sense that its practitioners are unknown \nto the masses.\nTechnique shapes an aristocratic society, which in turn implies \naristocratic government. Democracy in such a society can only be \na mere appearance. Even now, we see ki propaganda the premises \nof such a state of affairs. When it comes to state propaganda, there \nis no longer any question of democracy.\nLet us consider ordinary propaganda as it occurs in republican \ncountries. It is innocently said that since there is a plurality of \nparties and propaganda machines they counterbalance one an­\nother. The elector is therefore free to make a real choice between \nrival candidates. However, certain persons, perhaps no less in­\nnocently, claim to be able to mathematicize everything. Specifi­\ncally, the propaganda which is most technical, the most skillful \nand urgent, gets the greatest number of votes. As far as I am con­\ncerned, neither of these positions in itself perverts democracy. \nWhat does is the very accumulation of propaganda techniques, the \nvery deployment of technical means for exerting pressure. It is not"

The individual can \nno longer live except in a climate of tension and overexcitement. \nHe can no longer be a smiling and skeptical spectator. He is indeed \n\"engaged,” but involuntarily so, since he has ceased to dominate his \nown thoughts and actions. Techniques have taught the organizers \nhow to force him into the game. He has been stripped of his power \nof judgment. If he has not been “fixed” in advance, he oscillates \nat random, in obedience not to his own power of judgment but to \nthe law of large numbers. The intensive use of propaganda de­\nstroys the citizen’s faculty of discernment In a truly democratic \nregime, everything rests on judicious choice and free w ill But it \nis precisely in democracies that propaganda machines proliferate. \nWhere only a single propaganda machine exists, that of the state, \nit conditions individuals directly and could not be really intensive \nsince there is no competition.

It becomes thereby more and more insidious.\nThus, technique disturbs immediately the operation of a democ­\nracy.

It \nis of course possible to concoct grand theories on the art o f war \nand strategic doctrines, to organize armies in accordance with \nphilosophic principles, and so on. But one factor always upsets \neverything: the machine. The machine has in fact conditioned \nmodern strategy. Hitler, because he understood this, achieved cer­\ntain successes. The technical problem can be simply stated: given \na certain machine, how can it be used most efficiently? What ac-\n\f\nThe Technological Society i * 7 7\ntions concerning logistics, liaison, and co-ordination of weapons \nmust be taken? What plan must be created to make optimal use of \nthe machine? And so on. For example, the tank conditioned com­\nbat between 1939 and 1943. Today aircraft, guided missiles, and \nintercontinental rockets are of major inportance. But beyond the \neffect of technique on strategy, the changing machinery of war \nforces political choice. The United States, in a Congressional re­\nport (1949), recognized that because of the rapid advance of \ntechnique it was no longer in a position to pay for complete arma­\nment— for a land army with an unlimited number of vehicles of \nevery type, plus a navy and an air force. The military aircraft of \n1946 were already out of date by 1949. It seemed impossible to \ncontinue the construction of machines by the thousands which \nwould never see service and would so soon be outmoded. A politi­\ncal choice had to be made.\nSimilarly, Britain abandoned most of its prototypes in order to \ndevote itself to constructing a unique kind of army judged to be \ndecisive. The fact of forced political choice was confirmed by the \ndistribution of military tasks among continental Europe, the United \nStates, and Great Britain as a consequence of the Atlantic Pact \nWith further developments, it became necessary to seek new \nmodes of financing to support the burden of a military technique \ndistributed as described. This reminds us of the interdependence \nof techniques in general and in particular of the influence of tech­\nnique on military concepts and through this on political choice. In \nthis connection, recall Bevan’s biting remark in one of his last lec­\ntures: \"The techniques of modem war have destroyed democ­\nracy.” This is precisely our point.\nLet us reason by analogy. In the same way that military machines \ncondition strategy, organizational and other techniques condition \nthe structure of the modem state. Wiener was not speaking idly \nwhen he said that the different systems of broadcasting and air­\ntransport networks make a world state inevitable. Technique puts \nthe question, not whether a given state form is more just, but \nwhether it permits more efficient utilization of techniques. The \nstate is no longer caught between political reality and moral theo­\nries and imperatives. It is caught between political reality and \ntechnical means. The problem is to find the state form most ade­\nquate to the application of the techniques the state has at its dis-\n\f\n378  )  TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nposal. Doubtless, it is free to prefer a certain doctrine and to look \nwith disfavor on a given technique. It is free to dream of the reali­\nzation of a certain kind of justice rather than to make use of tech­\nnical means. But then it must expect almost inevitable retribution \nsuch as the French Army suffered in 1940. Our generals had their \ndoctrine and their military conceptions, but they neglected the in­\nfluence of the machine— a heroic example, it was said, of getting \nyourself killed at the outposts of progress. Face to face with techni­\ncal efficiency, the state owes it to itself to give this efficiency free \nrein. Ardant has written: “Good methods bring about good struc­\ntures.”\nThese factors doom parliamentary government, which is bur­\ndened with considerable excess baggage which hinders technical \nprogress: the numerous persons involved in decision making, the \nponderousness and slowness of democratic mechanisms, the com­\nplete inability of a representative assembly to apply political tech­\nnique, the frequent turnover in parliamentary personnel in contrast \nto the stability of the technicians in the service of the administra­\ntion, etc. As a result of these factors, technical advance gradually \ninvades the state, which in turn is compelled to assume forms and \nadopt institutions favorable to this advance. The importance of \n“commissions” in French parliamentary life is already recognized, \nand, it might be added, these commissions have clearly got out of \nhand. In the United States the system of lobbyists (a group of in­\ndividuals who hang about the corridors of Congress) assures liai­\nson between the legislative organ and the technical organ. All the \ngreat American corporations and technical groups have representa­\ntives accredited to Washington who are charged with looking after \nthe interests (not necessarily in the capitalist sensed of the groups \nthey represent in the legislative branch. The system is perfectly \nlegal in the United States and allows the retention of some connec­\ntion between politicians (who are more and more detached from \nreality) and the technical conditions of life. Such institutions rep­\nresent very weak modes of adaptation. It is certain that the mod­\nern state will eventually be compelled to total adaptation. Total \nadaptation may come about through a revolution, such as the one \nwhich created the Hitler state. It may be, however, that the con­\nstitution will not undergo even the slightest of alterations and that \nthe whole problem will be reduced to the elimination of political\n\f\nThe Technological Society (279\npowers, which will have become purely formal, a mere matter of \nshow. The conclusion seems unavoidable that this is the road upon \nwhich our democracies have already entered.\nBut if the state adapts itself completely to technical necessities \nand becomes nothing but a huge machine, will it still be recogniz­\nably a state? Let us first of all remark that the question in no sense \npresupposes a theory of a technological state. Things happen today \nin the political sphere without the benefit of the minutest theory. \nThere is no longer any question of a state in the classic sense. To \nthink otherwise is a laughable error on the part of the majority of \nthose who talk about the state, b^ they philosophers, theologians, \npublicists, politicians, or professors of constitutional law. They are \nspeaking of the state in terms and forms appropriate to the state of \nthe nineteenth century, or to that of Napoleon. The situation today \nis radically different.\nThe political power is no longer precisely a classical state, and it \nwill be less and less so. It is an amalgam of organizations with a \ngreatly reduced organism for making decisions, reduced because, \nin the interplay of techniques, decision making has less and less \nplace. The situation is comparable to the elimination by an auto­\nmatic machine of the individual, who retains no function except \nthat of inspecting the machine and seeing that it remains in work­\ning order; the political power is like any well-adjusted organization \nwhich functions with a minimum of decision making. Such an or­\nganization is not too rigid and knows of itself how to adapt to cur­\nrent problems. We are admittedly not yet in this situation, but we \nare rapidly approaching it/ This is the state form which Lenin \nforecast for the socialist world. \"The state,” he said, “will be re­\nduced to census taking and statistics.” Lenin of necessity described \nthe future role of the state in a very summary fashion; the tech­\nniques of organization were not yet developed in 1920. But what \nhe discerned is exactly what we observe in outline today behind\n* We shall sot consider here \"machines for evaluating m ilitary situations and de­\ntermining the best action.\" These m achines are no m ere fantasy. W iener, Shannon, \nand M orgenstern—among the elite of American m athem aticians—are working o n  \nsuch a machine and speak of it as \"imminent.\" W iener even thinks that this will \nlead to a m achine to evaluate political situations. Cybernetic devices will m ake \ndie state conduct politics as one plays a game of chess. If this apocalyptic possibility \nis realized, we clearly cannot foresee the consequences for the state. We therefore \nshall not consider the hypothesis."

What seems to be important is that the state \nLenin foresaw and the purely technological state which modern \norganizations imply are in fact identical.\nThat such a state is socialist is debatable. That it is technical (a \nstatement not intended as a theory) is not debatable. At this very \nmoment, technical synthesis could bring about the total elimination \nof the state in the traditional sense. The framework in which society \nexists could get along well enough without the traditional state, and \nperhaps even do better without it. The technological state corre­\nsponds directly to modem society itself since it is technically con­\nstructed and exists in the very soul of men who worship efficiency, \norder, and speed. The classical state corresponds to vanished forces \nof an entirely different nature.\nTechnique and Political Doctrine*. The structure of the state is \nnot the only thing modified by technique; political doctrines are \nmodified too.\nWe note, first of all, that the same thing holds for political doc­\ntrines as for political structures, that some are adapted to technical \nusage and some are not. In general, the new doctrines (those, for \nexample, of the people’s democracies, which it would be stupid to \nlump together naively as “Stalinist” ) are so adapted. “No freedom \nfor the enemies of freedom”; “Only the worker is a citizen”; “the \nstate guarantees freedom; the stronger the state, the more freedom \nis guaranteed.\" These slogans are representative of an idea which is \nbecoming prevalent. Doctrinal elements coincide exactly with the \ndevelopment of state techniques; doctrine expresses the social \nsituation exactly and is therefore vital. It is believed in by a large \nnumber of citizens; it tends toward effective application and pos­\nsesses a contagious force. On the other hand, the doctrines of tra­\nditional democracy— the rights of man, the abstract conception of \nthe citizen, equality in voting, the clash between power and liberty \n— are not adapted to modern social reality. For this reason, we are \nwitnessing the rapid sclerosis and obsolescence of these doctrines; \nand it is becoming harder and harder to defend them. Public opin­\nion no longer holds with them, except possibly among the Ameri­\ncans, who seem still to believe in individual freedom, a somewhat \ntheoretic concept. But democratic peoples as a whole are more at­\ntached to traditions than to precise doctrines. Democratic doctrine\n\f\nThe Technological Society (281\nis, in any case, unadapted to technical progress, a fact which robs \nit of any compelling force or power to make new conquests.\nDocuments such as the United Nations Declaration of Human \nRights mean nothing to a mankind surrounded by techniques. It is \nour responsibility to study man’s situation vis-i-vis techniques and \nnot vis-a-vis some no longer existent force. No one gets worked up \nabout declarations which may be violated with impunity, whether \nby private enterprise (as exemplified by the attitude of employers \non the subject of strikes in 1948) or by the state itself (as in the \ncase of the law of September 15,1948, concerning war crimes, a di­\nrect violation of the declaration of rights).\nTechnique has rendered traditional democratic doctrines obso­\nlete. This should be regarded as a normal situation, for no political \ndoctrine is eternal. When situations change, doctrines must change \ntoo. Evolution is necessary, whether it takes place under the in­\nfluence of technique or in some other way. But one fact does seem \nnew: what is in question is not merely a change of doctrine; politi­\ncal doctrine is being called upon to play a fundamentally different \nrole. In the nineteenth century, political doctrine was strongly pre­\nscriptive and constitutive; this was consonant both with the whole \nidealist and romantic movement and with the belief in progress. \nMen were convinced of the omnipotence of ideas and were pre­\npared to put into action doctrines which appeared to them to be \njust. Doctrinal motives played a role of prime importance in the \nRevolution of 1789. Napoleon I was disgraced because of his lack \nof doctrine, a deficiency which Napoleon III sought to overcome. \nRepublics and even monarchies were anxious to apply that doc­\ntrine which was most just. Political doctrine, whatever its content, \nestablished an end to be attained. It represented the best form of \ngovernment, founded in reason (rather than in history) and in phi­\nlosophy. The problem was to realize the ideal. Doctrine was the \ncriterion of action; it was the judge not so much of whether the ac­\ntion was well or ill done as of whether the action was valid with re­\nspect to the doctrine itself. Even Marx was of this mind; for him \nalso, doctrine represented the end and criterion of action. Mani­\nfestly, doctrine dominated political life; it was no mere conceit but \na reality.\nWith the introduction of technical development into the life of \nthe state, the situation becomes completely different; doctrine is\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE282  )\nmerely explicative and justifying. It no longer represents the end; \nthe end is defined by the autonomous operation of techniques. It is \nno longer the criterion of action; the sole criterion of action consists \nin knowing whether or not technique has been correctly used, and \nno political theory can tell us that.\nPolitical doctrine, since about 1914, works in this way: the state \nis forced by the operation of its own proper techniques to form its \ndoctrine of government on the basis of technical necessities. These \nnecessities compel action in the same way that techniques permit \nit. Political theory comes along to explain action in its ideological \naspect and in its practical aspect (frequently without indicating its \npurely technical motives). Finally, political doctrine intervenes to \njustify action and to show that it corresponds to ideals and to moral \nprinciples. The man of the present feels a great need for justifica­\ntion. He needs the conviction that his government is not only effi­\ncient but just Unfortunately, efficiency is a fact and justice a \nslogan.\nWe conclude that the political doctrine of today is a rationalizing \nmechanism for justifying the state and its actions and is the source \nof the dangerous intellectual acrobatics indulged in by official jour­\nnalists and statesmen. Sometimes the preoccupation of these gen­\ntlemen is to square some totally unjust action with democratic \nprinciples. A good example of this was the British intervention of \n1944 in Greece as a function of the Yalta agreements. This interven­\ntion resulted in the crushing of a popular movement (represented \nby ELAS and EAM)  under the pretext of organizing a Western- \nstyle democracy. Sometimes the aim of these men is to create a \njudicial doctrine in order to justify purely pragmatic action. The \nmasterpiece of this species of rationalization was the theory of \n\"trusteeship.” Judicially, the theory was extremely well constructed, \nbut its application led the United States inevitably to occupy the \nJapanese islands while forbidding the Soviet Union to occupy any \nenemy colony whatever. The direction of this \"theory” is clearly \nvisible. All the theories concerning “crimes against humanity” are \nof this order; the charge of genocide is in fact the judicial justifica­\ntion of the need to condemn the vanquished as war criminals.\nThe French Constitution of 1958 is another example of this tend­\nency; it was devised to justify a de facto situation. The Commu­\nnists, however, are the real virtuosi of this genre. They have re-"

Once this is achieved, no contradiction between doctrine \nand action is possible. Take, for instance, the Soviet doctrine of \nthe necessity of the “national stage” in the development of all \npeoples, a doctrine intended to justify Soviet intervention in Africa. \nAll Soviet actions are a consequence of their method, which, being \nat the same time a doctrine, serves to justify action.\nThe only real problem, then, is to know whether action has been \neffective by virtue of the correct application of method. The prob­\nlem thus becomes purely technical. In ordinary democratic govern­\nments, the unity of doctrine and method resolves all contradictions \nthat show themselves as bad conscience. Nowadays, it is enough if \nfidelity to method is assured— this fidelity, as all techniques, is \ntested by results— for justification to be assured also. Justification, \nno doubt, only in the eyes of those who already believe in the doc­\ntrine. It is illusory to think that political doctrine can justify action \nin an objective way, erga omnes. The adversary is never really \ntaken in by this “justification,” although he may well accept it, since \nhe uses it himself.\nThis transformation of the role of political doctrine demonstrates \nthe complete vanity of pfesent-day political theories. When we see \nsuch theoreticians as Max Glass or Ropke proposing a new world \nstructure to resolve all problems, or a new political regime to satisfy \nall exigencies, we stand confounded before such innocence (in the \netymological sense of the word). These political innocents always \nsuppose that theories have educational force, that mobs can bestir \nthemselves to apply principles, and that ideal doctrines will be­\ncome ends. The plain truth is that such opinions have been over­\ntaken and left behind.\nThe role of doctrines is fixed with precision by political technique, \nand since nothing else can stem the tide of history or of techniques, \nthere is no room for the supposition that political doctrines will \nchange roles in the near future. Because of the vanity of their pre­\ntentions, our political theoreticians cannot be taken seriously. How \ncould we possibly take seriously, on the political level, anyone who \ndoes not even know how to view fundamental events?

Before that \ntime, political theories incontestably played the role of justifiers, \nas they do today. Thus, the counselors of Philip IV, armed with the \nwhole apparatus of Roman law, used it for the sole purpose of lend­\ning an appearance of legitimacy to the acts of their king. The same \napplies to Richelieu and to the theory of the divine right of kings. \n(I purposely do not cite Machiavelli because his theories were \nnever applied.) In reality the brutal reversal we are witnessing at \npresent is essentially a return to a long tradition. Power is power; \nbut it cannot be exercised without at least the appearance of justice. \nDoctrine is charged, therefore, with the task of furnishing power \nwith this semblance of justice. We repeat, it has not always been so. \nBut since, at present, power is technique, these intellectual con­\nstructs no longer have any usefulness beyond supplying justifica­\ntion.\nThe Totalitarian State. Finally, technique causes the state to be­\ncome totalitarian, to absorb the citizens’ life completely. We have \nnoted that this occurs as a result of the accumulation of techniques \nin the hands of the state. Techniques are mutually engendered and \nhence interconnected, forming a system that tightly encloses all our \nactivities. When the state takes hold of a single thread of this net­\nwork of techniques, little by little it draws to itself all the matter \nand the method, whether or not it consciously wills to do so.\nEven when the state is resolutely liberal and democratic, it can­\nnot do otherwise than become totalitarian. It becomes so either \ndirectly or, as in the United States, through intermediate persons. \nBut, despite differences, all such systems come ultimately to the \nsame result. I shall not repeat these facts since I believe that I have \nsufficiently emphasized them.\nTechnique engenders totalitarianism by another expedient: its \nmode of action. Let us take a simple example, that of total war. \nThere has been a theory of total war, and consequently, it would \nseem, some will and choice in the matter. But the action of tech­\nniques nowadays makes war of necessity total. The use of guided \nmissiles such as the Va weapons and rockets which had an error of \nabout nine miles in three hundred, presupposed that the great \nmajority of them would fall among the civilian population. The \nsame holds for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile: one ICBM is \ncapable of destroying all life over very considerable areas. Auto-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( » 8 g\nmatic steering mechanisms can give great precision to the flight of \nantiaircraft missiles. But precision of aim has no meaning when \ntargets are terrestrial objects closely grouped together. A  formation \nof bombers is isolated in the sky, and a missle fired at them neces­\nsarily hits a military target. But this is not so on the ground.\nThe situation is even more acute with an H-bomb which can de­\nstroy everything within a radius of thirty miles. Despite any and \nall possible precautions, the H bomb would destroy civilians and \nnonmilitary structures. There is no need here to decide whether or \nnot to make total war. Even if one wished to limit it, war is total be­\ncause the means are totalitarian.\nThe same applies to civilian techniques. It is no longer possible \nto limit their effects even if there is a desire to do so. Censoring \nfilms may sometimes limit their subject matter, give them a con­\nformist tone or a moral content; but it does not touch the essential, \nthat is, the psychic modification of the individual by means of the \nviolent impression films make upon him. The emotion he inevitably \nfeels modifies the psychological tonus of the individual and tends \nto make him a component of a mob. Such effects lie outside the \nrange of possible means of rectification. Or, put more precisely, \nnew means of rectification will be invented. One might, for ex­\nample, try psychoanalysis or one might limit the number of per­\nformances each week. But such measures only represent a new at­\ntack on the human soul or a new limitation of freedom.\nIt would be possible to consider in turn every element of state \ntechnique and to show that each one, pushed to the limit, leads to \ntotalitarianism. Jacques Driencourt has unwittingly done this for \npropaganda and Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt for police techniques.\nDriencourt attempts to show that propaganda is consistent with \ndemocracy, but he recognizes parenthetically that democratic gov­\nernment is obliged to integrate propaganda into its institutions for \nreasons outside its own principles. He recognizes that democracy \nis obliged to exploit the same practices, the same violation of hu­\nman conscience, and the same encouragement of conformism as \ndoes totalitarianism. He has, in fact, shown that propaganda is in \nitself totalitarian. And when he asserts that propaganda is demo­\ncratic if it is not a monopoly, he forgets what he proved at the be­\nginning of his book, that propaganda always tends to monopoly. \nThe fact is that when the state employs a complete and technical\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE286)\npropaganda system, it inevitably becomes totalitarian. Driencourt \nnotes with surprise that “the country which boasts of being most \nliberal [that is, the United States] is the country in which the tech­\nnique of thought direction is, by its perfection, the closest to totali­\ntarian practices; and is the country in which people, accustomed \nto living in groups, are most inclined to leave it to the experts to \n&  lines of spiritual conduct.”\nAs for the police power, it is to be noted that when it becomes \ntechnical, it assumes the leading position in the state and becomes \na fundamental institution, not merely a supplementary one. It af­\nfirms itself as the “essence of the state.” It appears as a mysterious \nentity which evades all laws and assumes complete autonomy. As \nHamel says: “It is the irrational nucleus which escapes all defini­\ntion and limitation by the sovereignity of the state.” In fact, we \nmight as well have an undisguised totalitarianism which controls \neverything, since the simple use of techniques produces a totalitar­\nian structure of the state, as it does in the economy.\nWhy is this so? The answer is that technique is a mass instru­\nment. One can think of technique only in terms of categories. \nTechnique has no place for the individual; the personal means \nnothing to it  We certainly cannot deny in theory that every individ­\nual is particular; we even concede him his particularity willingly. \nBut in the case of rules of organization and action we are unable to \ntake this particularity into account. It must remain carefully con­\ncealed; the particular is identical with the subjective and is not \nallowed to show. If it could appear it would have to do so by way \nof technique, and in technique there is no particular. Technical \nprocedures, therefore, abstract from the individual and seek traits \ncommon to masses of men and mass phenomena. Without these com­\nmon traits, neither statistics nor the use of the law of great numbers \nnor the Gaussian curve— indeed, no organization— would be pos­\nsible. Abstraction from the individual is doubtless intended only \nas a formal procedure for the convenience of reasoning. But the \nformal has become terribly real. It has produced the world which \nconstrains man on every side, which leaves him no outlet to that \nrealm which was ostensibly excluded merely for the convenience \nof reasoning. There no longer exists any form in which the particu­\nlar can be concretely incarnated because form has become the \ndomain of technique. Technique, in the form of psychotechnique,\n\f\nTheTechnological Society (287\naspires to take over the individual, that is, to transform the qual­\nitative into the quantitative. It knows only two possible solutions: \nthe transformation or the annihilation of the qualitative. It is pre­\ncisely by way of the former that technique is totalitarian; and \nwhen the state becomes technical, it too becomes totalitarian; it has \nno alternative.\nThe words the totalitarian state inevitably evoke cliches and \npassionate opinions. But these no longer represent anything but \nhistorical reminiscences. The totalitarian state we are discussing \nhere is not the brutal, immoderate thing which tortured, deformed, \nand broke everything in its path, the battleground of armed bullies \nand factions, a place of dungeons and the reign of the arbitrary. \nThese things did certainly exist; but they represented transient \ntraits, not real characteristics of the totalitarian state. It might even \nbe said that they were the human aspects of the state in its inhu­\nmanity. Torture and excess are the acts of persons who use them as \na means of releasing a suppressed need for power. This does not in­\nterest us here. It does not represent the true face of the completely \ntechnical, totalitarian state. In such a state nothing useless exists; \nthere is no torture; torture is a wasteful expenditure of psychic \nenergy which destroys salvageable resources without producing \nuseful results. There is no systematically organized famine, but \nrather a recognition of the pressing necessity of maintaining the \nlabor force in good condition. There is nothing arbitrary, for the \narbitrary represents the very opposite of technique, in which every­\nthing “has a reason” ( not a final but a mechanical reason). Irra­\ntionality might appear to exist— but only for the person who \nknows nothing of technique; it is like trying to tell a man who does \nnot know the radio that there is music all around him although he \ncannot hear it.\nThe totalitarian state does not necessarily have totalitarian theo­\nries, nor does it necessarily even desire them. On the contrary, what \nwe call totalitarian doctrines litter up the clear line of the technical \nstate with aberrant elements such as “race,” “blood,” “proletariat” \nThe technical state is the technical state only because it exploits \ncertain technical means.\nThere is, however, a great difference between the democracies \nand the so-called totalitarian states.

The rule, for them, is to use means \nWithout limitation of any sort. The democratic states, on the other \nhand, have not attained to this consciousness and are consequently \ninhibited in their development Scruples concerning tradition, \nprinciples, judicial affirmations, the maintenance of a fagade of \npublic and private morality— all these still exist in the democratic \nstate. It may be going too far to say that scruples concerning hu­\nman beings also exist in democratic states; the democratic state is \npreoccupied most of all with a very special type of man: the voter.\nAll these scruples, in any case, are without force or reality. They \nare merely verbal smokescreens, and the democracies disregard \nthem every time it is necessary to do so. This fagade no longer \ncorresponds in any way to a real community; it represents only \nvestiges of a community. Nevertheless, however without substance \nsuch talk may be, it still has great importance in democratic life, \nespecially as it acts to prevent democratic governments from \nlaunching themselves along the road of technique without some \nother justification. Here, more than anywhere else, justification is \nnecessary. Even so, democracies have a bad governmental con­\nscience which no one has succeeded in dispelling. The state has \nnot taken the decisive step of affirming that only technical neces­\nsity counts; it has therefore failed to do two things: to become con­\nscious (of what the state can accomplish by exploiting tech­\nniques) and to sow its wild oats (by deciding that there are no \ncompelling moral reasons to get in its way). Thus, at present every \ntime the democratic state exploits a given technique, it must begin \nall over again to justify itself, to debate the necessity of the pro­\nposed measure, and to question everything. In the long run it will \nhave to capitulate, but in the meantime its scruples act as a drag on \nit, if not in the actual application of techniques (which would, in \nany case, be impossible), at least in its enterprise. In order to force \nthe democratic state to come to any decision there must always be \na “present danger,” some direct competition with the dictatorial \nstate, in which action becomes a matter of life or death.\nThe superiority of dictatorship stems wholly from its massive ex­\nploitation of techniques. Democracy has no choice in the matter: \neither it utilizes techniques in the same way as the enemy, or it will\n\f\nThe Technological Society (289\nperish. It is clear enough that the first term of this proposition will \nprevail For this reason, wars always bring about a prodigious \nadvance in the use of certain techniques in democratic societies. \nThe democracies are, of course, careful to assert that they are using \nthese techniques only because of the state of war. But there are al­\nways wars of one kind or another: war preparations, cold war, hot \nwar, new cold war, and so on, ad infinitum.\nIndeed, cold war is as productive as hot war in forcing the \ndemocracies to imitate the dictatorships in the use of technique. \nThe officers of the French Army, for example, have been obliged to \nengage in psychological activity and subversive war to counter the \nenemy’s use of these. Here is a good example of technical imitation \nof a dictatorship by a democracy.\nUp to this point we have contrasted the democratic state with the \ndictatorial state. But we have not distinguished among the different \nforms assumed by the dictatorships. There are two major lines \nfollowed by these states, represented, respectively, by Commu­\nnism and Fascism. The question might be put whether or not these \ntwo are identical. A superficial, bourgeois survey will immediately \ncome up with an affirmative answer, on the basis of certain massive \nfacts of the present day. It might be noted, for example, that both \nsides have concentration camps, enormous police apparatuses, \ntorture, ration cards, economic and other kinds of planning, plebi­\nscites in place of elections, a single party (Nazi or Communist) \ndominating the state, a single individual exercising plenary pow­\ners, and so on. This adds up to a complex of identical forms; as a \nconsequence, the regimes are alike. The intellectuals, however, \nwill protest against such a hasty assimilation of the two; and in a \ndeeper sense, the differences are real.\nIn Communism, despite its methods, there is an indubitable will \nto human liberation. It has the genuine support of millions of \npoverty-striken persons and, consequently, a humane aspect which \nFascism never possessed. It recruits its adherents from many dif­\nferent parties— on the one hand from the true proletariat and on the \nother from the “Lumpen-proletariat,” that is to say, a sub-proletar­\niat without positive value. Communism has the honesty not to \naffirm bogus spiritual values or make pacts with international cap­\nitalism. In addition, the fact that Nazism was anti-Semitic has a\n\f\n2go) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nspecial significance for Christians— a point which Karl Barth has \nemphasized. Communism as such does not imply this, even though \nit may become anti-Semitic for short periods.\nUpon closer analysis, however, we find a similarity between the \ntwo: a comparable attitude toward techniques. This relation may \nappear to some a bit thin, but it is the very essence of the twin \nmovement represented by Communism and Fascism, both of \nwhich owe their origin to techniques, and uniquely so. Communism \nemerges when the development of certain techniques endangers \nthe very society which has allowed them to flourish. Communist \ndialectic makes its appearance as an explanation of the way in \nwhich technical progress first produced a society, then transcended \nthat society’s economic and political forms, finally provoking their \ninevitable decline. Marxism orders this succession of events into a \nprecise doctrine. It furnishes the key to an understanding of the \nmodern world and at the same time ties its own fate to that of tech­\nnique. Recall in this connection the famous remark of Lenin con­\ncerning socialism and electrification. Marxism is, in fact, nothing \nbut an epiphenomenon of technical development, a phase of the \npainful marriage of man and technique. “Neither with thee, nor \nwithout thee.” It is an attempt at dialectic reconciliation, so to \nspeak.\nFascism stands in exactly the same relation to technique. It can be \nstated without exaggeration (in spite of the scandalous character \nof such an affirmation) that both Fascism and Nazism are approxi­\nmations derived from Marx for the adaptation of man to his tech­\nniques. They represent that part of Marxism which is centered on \nthe narrower problem of the state and technique, whereas Marx­\nism itself is a broader theory encompassing the totality of the prob­\nlem of society and technique. Nazism, however, far from being \nopposed to Marxism, completes it and confirms it. It gives the solu­\ntion to numerous problems of adaptation. Hitler's methods stem \ndirectly from Lenin’s precepts; and conversely, Stalinism learned \ncertain lessons about technique from the Nazis.\nIf we suppress the episodic in order to get at the essential, we \nfind in the two fraternal enemies the same phenomenon of awe at \nthe power to be had from technique, and the same enthusiastic pur­\nsuit of the same objective. The Guelphs and the Ghibellines made \nmerciless war on each other to decide which party was to exercise\n\f\nThe Technological Society (2  j) 1\nworld supremacy. But they had the same objective: the greatest \npossible power of the state whose sovereignty had no limits, the \nearthly hope of all whom feudal anarchy had exhausted.\nThe dictatorial state has efficiency as its goal. It submits to the \nlaw of techniques, for it understands that only by giving tech­\nniques free rein can it hope to derive the maximum profit from \nthem. Whatever techniques are involved— human or physical, eco­\nnomic or educational— the state musters around it all available \ntechnical instruments. This occurs spontaneously, by chance; but \nin dictatorial states it is voluntary, calculated, studied (and there­\nfore the process occurs more rapidly). It is the end sought by all \nforms of state. The Communist knows that technical progress \nmeans the progress of the proletariat. The Nazi knows that he is the \ninstrument of state power; he cannot conceive that anyone would \nallow its limitation.\nNazism gave its goals an ideological veneer, but this veneer was \nfutile insofar as it was not an instrument of propaganda and pro­\nceeded too rapidly. Communism, in its fusion of technique and \nstate, proved much more prudent and in that sense more humanis­\ntic. It was in this way closer to reality and less shocking to the con­\nscience of the average man. Hitlerism caused the essential barbar­\nism of the thing to explode in men’s faces. Behemoth showed his \ntrue face, and it proved to be too terrifying for the man of 1930, \nwho still sought to hold on to some of his illusions and to preserve \nfor himself at least the semblance of freedom. In this, Nazism com­\nmitted a grave error which the Communists knew well enough how \nto exploit. However, both Nazism and Communism were working \ntoward the total exploitation of the means which man had created \nto vanquish necessity.\nSummum Jus: Summa Injuria\nThe function of justice provokes an unending major debate be­\ntween the claims of justice and those of judicial technique.\nJudicial technique is in every way much less self-confident than \nthe other techniques, because it is impossible to transform the \nnotion of justice into technical elements. Despite what philosophers \nmay say, justice is not a thing which can be grasped or fixed. If one\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*9* )\npursues genuine justice (and not some automatism or egalitarian* \nism), one never knows where one will end. A law created as a func­\ntion of justice has something unpredictable in it which embar­\nrasses the jurist. Moreover, justice is not in the service of the state; \nit even claims the right to judge the state. Law created as a function \nof justice eludes the state, which can neither create nor modify it. \nThe state of course sanctions this situation only to the degree that it \nhas little power or has not yet become fully self-conscious; or to the \ndegree that its jurists are not exclusively technical rationalists and \nsubordinated to efficient results. Under these conditions, technique \nassumes the role of a handmaiden modestly resigned to the fact that \nshe does not automatically get what she desires.\nA certain equilibrium is established between the pursuit of jus­\ntice and the judicial technique which flourishes in a period of natu­\nral law.5  Judicial technique has a place, but in many respects it is \nnot easily defined.\nThere are indeed very different definitions of the role of judicial \ntechnique. For Saleille, judicial technique constitutes the arrange­\nment of judicial concepts, the reduction of rules to a coherent sys­\ntem. This limits it to a highly theoretical notion, essentially an in­\ntellectual operation. The same holds for Savigny’s contention that \njudicial technique is concerned with the scientific elaboration of \nlaw by jurists, as opposed to the spontaneous creation of law by the \npeople! This is doubtless not inexact, but Savigny is referring rather \nto the consequences of judicial technique. It is true that when \njudicial technique develops, the spontaneous creation of law de­\nclines and dies; that the popular source of law is sterilized by \nlearned law; and that this gives the jurists a free hand. But then, \nSavigny is describing an aspect of judicial technique, not the pur­\npose of judicial technique. We come much closer to actuality with \nKohler, who assigns to judicial technique the role of adapting legal \ntexts to practice. And it is Kohler’s concept which has guided the \nmajor authors who have studied the problem of judicial technique, \nalbeit with individual differences (Geny, Dabin, Haesaert, Per- \nrot).\nIn this context, judicial technique consists in setting reality in a \nframework of means through legal decisions and in rendering these\n9 O n these points, see m y Fondementthtologique du droit.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (a g 3\ndecisions effective. It can then be reasonably argued that political \nfunction and judicial technique are complementary. Political func­\ntion consists in supplying the substance of the rules, that is, the \ngoal to be attained, the political or social ideal which the law is to \nrealize. By its laws the state will also indicate ways and means of \nreaching the political goal, and in so doing will approach reality \nto a sufficient degree, without, however, grappling with it directly. \nIt is the task of the jurists to give form to the instructions and de­\ncisions of the law, not only by rendering them systematic but by \nimplementing them. Legal form is clearly not a mere verbal, ex­\nternal matter, but a means of effecting something. It has a broader \nscope than Perrot suggests when he defines legal technique as an \n“operational procedure meant to secure the goal sought by the \nwill by causing the will to enter onto the legal plane.'\nBut this exclusive relation between technique and will, which \nleaves out the whole judicial expression of social and economic \nTeality, is far too restricted. Judicial technique is not merely a \ntechnique of adaptation but one of creation of law in its entirety.\nThe great task of judicial technique then is to arrange the ele­\nments furnished it by the political function in order that the law \nnot be merely a verbalism, a dead letter. And this takes a whole \narsenal of proofs, civil and penal sanctions, guarantees, in short, \nthe whole detailed mechanism created to secure the realization of \nthe ends of the law.\nHaesaert seems to me to have defined this judicial technique ex­\ncellently as “the ensemble of means by which the subjects of law \nare induced to take, in the social system in which they exist, the \nlegal attitude,\" the active or passive behavior judged necessary. It \nis really, therefore, a question of obedience, and this is in fact the \nend toward which judicial technique aims.\nFor the technician of the law, all law depends on efficiency. \nThere is no law but in its application. A law which is not applied \nis not a law. Obedience to rule is the fundamental condition of its \nbeing. Legal abstraction is unreal. The whole technical apparatus \n(expression of legal norms, publication of laws, applications in \njurisprudence or doctrine, voluntary or forced realization) has but \none end: the application of the law. And this complex corresponds \nexacdy to the notion of technique in general, that is, an artificial \nsearch for efficiency. In this definition, efficiency is taken in its"

The term artificial is used in the same way; law is no longer \nobeyed spontaneously, and the popular consciousness which origi­\nnally created law does not adhere spontaneously and naturally to \nthis system. Application of law no longer arises from popular ad­\nhesion to it but from the complex of mechanisms which, by means of \nartifice and reason, adjust behavior to rule.\nThis technical creation of law is, then, requisite and gains its \nscope through two operations:\n1) By means of the first the judicial element is separated from \nthe law as such. The judicial element (which becomes principally \norganization) is no longer charged with pursuing justice or creating \nlaw in any way whatsoever. It is charged with applying the laws. \nThis role can be perfectly mechanical. It does not call for a phi­\nlosopher or a man with a sense of justice. What is needed is a good \ntechnician, who understands the principles of the technique, the \nrules of interpretation, the legal terminology, and the ways of de­\nducing consequences and finding solutions. The removal of law \nfrom the concrete is a great step forward in the process of tech- \nnicization. The judicial element is charged with certain practical \nquestions but, as we have said, not with making law. It is in a \nposition to become technical in detail because the problem of \njustice is no longer one of its concerns. It does not have to be judge \nof the rules which it is commissioned to apply.\n2) The dissociated judicial element gains more efficiency to the \ndegree that it is made completely technical. It becomes possible to \ndivorce judicial reasoning from a “dangerous empiricism, by con­\nfining the infinite diversity of judicial situations to a limited num­\nber of conceptual frameworks.” Fundamental legal institutions \nthereby derive simplicity and vigor because they are more directly \nbased in the techniques which give them their logical foundation. \nThis logical foundation is doubtless compensated by a certain \nsclerosis of the legal framework and by a certain stiffness of judicial \nwill. If, moreover, because of the invasion of techniques the judicial \nfactor exists apart from concrete problems, it comes under state \ncontrol\nThere is, in addition, another problem: the perpetual problem of \njustice. Justice is no longer conceived of as a practical requirement \nvis-a-vis individual problems, but rather as a mere idea, an abstract\n\f\nThe Technologieal Society ( a 9 5\nnotion. Then it becomes simple to discard it entirely. Even so, men \nof law have certain scruples and are unable to eliminate justice \nfrom the law completely without twinges of conscience. But it is \nnot possible to retain it because of the difficulties it involves, the \nuncertainty of operation and unpredictability it entails. In a word, \njudicial technique implies that bureaucracy cannot be burdened \nany longer with justice.\nBut, in that case, how shall another and newer meaning be given \nto the law? It is a remarkable fact that all societies which have \narrived at a certain degree of state control and legal evolution \nhave found the same answer to this question. In Egypt, in Rome \nin the fourth century after Christ, in fifteenth-century France, and \nin all of twentieth-century Western civilization, the concept of or­\nder and security is substituted for justice as the end and foundation \nof law when judicial technique becomes sufficiently developed.\nThe formula then becomes: “Better injustice than disorder.” The \nnotions of order and security are at least as easily reduced to tech­\nnique as is the impossible notion of justice. One knows exactly what \nmeasures must be taken to achieve order. The definition of order \nmay vary, but the means are always the same. One knows and is \nin a position to specify the conditions of legal security. Even though \nthese means imply injustice, it is impossible to object, in view of the \nchangeable character of the concept of justice. The more explicit \njudicial technique becomes, the more the law tends to ensure or­\nder. This is, moreover, one of the major objectives of the state. \nTherefore, the law and the police become identical, for the law is \nno longer anything but an instrument of the state. At such a price \njudicial technique blossoms and yields its consequences. Today we \nare in a position to study this phenomenon in all its vigor.\nAt most, a possible inconsistency in the laws (to which the need \nfor order constrains the state) might trouble the conscience of \njurists. But since there is no longer any foundation of law in justice, \nlegal inconsistency cannot have any very far-reaching effects or \nendanger the judicial technique.\nThe schematism I have described is found over and over again \nbehind the complexity of modem legal phenomena. Under such \nconditions the traditional equilibrium between the technical and \nhuman elements is quickly lost. In affirming that there is no law \nwithout efficiency, we in fact announce the implicit sacrifice of jus-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*S6)\ntice and the human being to efficiency. With this lack of equi­\nlibrium, the door is wide open to further technical invasion. We are \nwitnessing the result— the takeover of law by technique— among \nnations which have a less firmly rooted legal sense than the French.\nUntil now I have been speaking of judicial technique still as a \nrecognizable part of the world of law. The jurist, although turned \ntechnician, adhered to a general line which prevented technique \nfrom reaching a “pure” state. But once the pure technical men­\ntality, technique-in-itself, has penetrated the legal world, legal \ntechnique, which no longer has its roots in law but in the physical \nsciences or perhaps even in biology, brings about certain decisive \nupheavals in social life. The technician rejects both the school of \nnatural law and the historical school, so that, according to \nF. Jiinger, the law becomes merely a complex of technical norms. \nThe demands of conscience, as well as those of society ( to use the \ntraditional language), become subordinated to normative tech­\nnique. It is no longer considered necessary to secure popular ad­\nherence to law or to be limited to legal means in order to secure \nthe application of law. The enormous simplicity of technique has \ndeprived the whole ensemble of judicial mechanisms of meaning—  \nmechanisms which had as their end to guarantee the law and to \ncause it to be obeyed without excessive use of force. The whole \napparatus of devices such as penalties, distraints, and the like, no \nlonger makes sense. There is no need of such finesse. Adherence and \nobedience are secured by extralegal means (among which the po­\nlice are very often the most innocuous).\nWe are today in the process of transcending the traditional posi­\ntion. That is to say, law ensures order instead of justice. Hans \nICelsen represents the culmination of this development; and it was \nexpressed ii, certain of tire legal forms of nariiuu. x ne itszis recog­\nnized that a science of human behavior would make it possible to \ndispense with many legal rules. If the people to be administered \nwere “persuaded,” if they were made to understand by sufficiently \npowerful means that the observation of the rule was in their own \ninterest, that rule would become more and more useless. If a suf­\nficiently functional, realistic, and coherent pattern is established for \nthe organized human milieu (and the technique of organization can \nfurnish such a plan in short order), a great part of the administra­\ntive apparatus is rendered superfluous. In this way society is di-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (297\nrected toward a progressive emptying of legal forms and a conse­\nquent gain in the human techniques which render a gendarmery \nuseless.\nA further consequence of the technicization of the law is that the \ndistinction between political technique and judicial technique dis­\nappears, for all practical purposes. The subject and object of the \nlaw are no longer social, but rather technical, exigencies. The \ntechnician approves of proceeding in this way: the very matter of \nlaw becomes his object. He has good reason to desire such a situa­\ntion. He is no longer burdened with absurd methods of procedure. \nHis judgments become completely rational since he understands \nthe social necessities and the economic situation and can take them \ninto account in his calculations. But it should not be thought that \nthe technician merely translates these necessities into law. Above \nall, he elaborates them, and they are essentially subordinate to him \nand his technique.\nThis explains the enormous proliferation of laws. The technician \nanalyzes and predicts; he cannot endure the indeterminate or tol­\nerate any initiative which upsets order. These two traits explain the \nmultiplicity of laws. In the past, this multiplicity was attributed \nto inefficiency. The repeated promulgation of a law, or the indefi­\nnite multiplication of laws, accentuated the fact that laws were \ngoing unobserved. Legal multiplicity today is something else \nagain. Whatever a technician believes is true must be made into \nlaw. But his inferences only concern details. His analytic spirit \nleads him to perceive, understand, and affirm strictly localized \ntruths; and thus strictly delimited, they then become the objects \nof law. There must be a law for each fact; whence the indefinite \nproliferation of the legal apparatus.\nThe modem proliferation of laws can also be explained by the \nlegal technician’s complete antipathy to the notion of a doctrinal \nlaw, to a jurisprudence of “concepts.” A legal system which merely \nestablishes principles and lays down general lines of procedure \nentrusts to the judge the creation of the living law under the \nmaxim praetor viva vox juris civilis.* Such a state of affairs is in­\ntolerable to the technician, who dreads above all else the arbitrary,\n•\"The magistrate is the real voice of the civil law.\" M. Ellul points out elsewhere \nto what a degree Roman law depended on the magistrate's interpretation of very \ngeneral, not to say vague, legal maxims. (Trans.)\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE298)\nthe personal, and the fortuitous. The technician is the great enemy \nof chance; he finds the personal element insupportable. For that \nreason he finds it advisable to enclose the judge or the administrator \nin a tighter and tighter technical network, more and more hedged \nabout with legal prescriptions, in such a way that the citizen will \nunderstand exactly where he is heading and just what conse­\nquences are to be expected.\nLaw, then, must provide for every contingency, so that man can­\nnot disturb its operation. The traditional development of law in­\nvolved a kind of competition between judges and crooks; but with \nthe progress of technique, this is no longer the case. Society, \nthrough the application of extralegal means, is beginning to guar­\nantee public obedience to the law. Its real problem now is to \nrestrain the activities of those who would apply the law only to \ndistort it, from the judge down to the lowest prison guard.\nThe smallest detail must therefore be invested with the majesty of \nthe law: after all, law concerns an organized society. The law of \npersons, for example, is now the law of persons technically or­\nganized. Even property law has been profoundly modified by the \ndisturbances to which technique has subjected property owner­\nship. We see once more that all the fundamental technical data \nverify and reinforce one another.\nAs to the consequences, I believe they may be reduced to two: \nlaw becomes a mere instrument of the state; and, in the end, law \ndisappears. The first of these statements is in no way connected \nwith a general theory of law. I am not saying that the essence of \nlaw is reduced to the will of the state. I confine myself to the ob­\nservation of facts. When the law becomes technical, it must be \nformulated on the basis of technical methods; it is necessary to \npropound an “edict” from some center (exactly as in the Latin \ne-dicere). Technical law implies a close relation with the state; \nand the more technical the law becomes, the more this relation be­\ncomes exclusive of all but technical content. The movement is rein­\nforced by the fact that the state simultaneously becomes technical \ntoo.\nThis concordant development results in an actual identification \n(apart from any doctrinal position) of the expression of the law \nwith some purely administrative proceeding. It is always possible, \nof course, to affirm the supremacy of aspects of the law other than\n\f\nThe Technological Society (299\nits actual expression; they are completely detached from reality, \nbeing separated from it by a formidable arsenal of strictly adminis­\ntrative texts and the specific turn of the technical mentality. The \nlaw at present is an affair of the state. The state, whenever it ex­\npresses itself, makes law. There are no longer any norms to regulate \nthe activity of the state; it has eliminated the moral rules that \njudged it and absorbed the legal rules that guided it. The state is \na law unto itself and recognizes no rules but its own will. When, in \nthis way, technique breaks off the indispensable dialogue between \nthe law and the state, it makes the state a god in the most theologi­\ncally accurate sense of the term: a power which obeys nothing but \nits own will and submits to no judgment from without. This godlike \nwill of the state is for modern man the most precise expression of \ntechnique.\nIn the second place, we are witnessing the disappearance of the \nlaw in the legal proliferation described. This dissolution is notable \nin two things, the loss by the law of its end and of its domain.\nIn connection with the first point, law, whether we like it or \nnot, is dependent on justice. This is no arbitrary affirmation; fur­\nther, I do not have in mind a justice which is subject to all manner \nof intellectual tortures. When law is detached from justice, it be­\ncomes a compass without a needle. The substitution of order for \njustice, useful though this may be for the purpose of making law \ntechnical, itself quickly becomes a contributory factor in this dis­\nsociation. For what does order signify? In effect, the same thing as \nefficiency. Law must assure order. Order is the application of the \nwill of the state. Law must be efficient. Efficiency is itself order. \nOnce more we witness a general transformation of means into ends. \nLaw thus becomes an activity without any end and without any \nmeaning. It is efficient for efficiency’s sake; and individual laws are \nconceived solely with a view to being efficient. The whole func­\ntional theory of law is in accord with this. The idea that every man \nhas a function in society, that the law exists to give him the means \nof fulfilling this function and to see to it that he does fulfill it, rep­\nresents justice in abstracto. The idea is not new; it dominated the \nwhole of medieval law. What is new (and is in process of com­\npletely changing the meaning of the idea of function) is the rela­\ntion between function and technique. Law no longer poses the \nproblem of the finality of man’s functions. Law no longer co-\n\f\n300)  TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nordinates man’s functions in their relation to justice. As soon as that \nfunction is keyed to technique, it becomes valid in and of itself. \nEveryone’s function, once it has become technical, finds in tech­\nnique its meaning and validity; its proper results and destiny are of \nlittle importance. The law has become a mere organizer of indi­\nvidual functions. It thus constitutes only a part of the larger science \nof social relations and connections.\nThis development is clearly taking place today in property law, \ncontract law, and so on; similarly it is contributing to the dissolu­\ntion of the law. Traditionally, there was a specific domain of law \nwhich could easily be defined, for example, by comparing different \nlegal systems, present and past. Legal domain always remained \nthe same; today, however, the frontiers have expanded. It is no \nlonger possible to distinguish between what is law and what is \nnot. Every application of technique to the social sphere becomes \npart of the domain of law. A clear example of this is the problem \nof planning: the true legal domain, today, is that of planning. \nEverything affected by planning must be transformed into law. \nThe domain of law is therefore no longer defined by object or by \nend, but by method.\nThis transition represents a triumph of technique. No longer is the \npreoccupation of the law and justice its measure. The law’s con­\ncern is to apply new means to all accessible areas. The very being \nof the law is thus dissolved. In itself the law has come to represent \nnothing but a terminology and a travesty on tradition which hap­\npens to be useful to the new lords and masters. People who today \nhold the law in contempt are at least not deceived by false im­\npressions. Nevertheless, in consenting to be robbed in this way, \nman renounces one of his highest vocations.\nRepercussion on Technique\nIt is not merely the state which is being transformed by the techni­\ncal movement. For the past thirty-odd years, when the encounter \nbetween the state and technique has become more explicit, tech­\nnique has developed with greater rapidity than ever before, not \nonly according to its own internal logic but also with the aid of \nthe power and support of the state. The advantages of private\n\f\nThe Technological Society (301\nand public techniques have complemented each other in such a \nway as virtually to cancel out the inconveniences of either. W e \nhave seen, for example, that the immobility to which the technique \nof the state tends is compensated for by the activities of private \ntechniques— initiative remaining with the individual even when \nprivate technique has become state technique.\nBut we must admit that the state’s appropriation of technique \nhas dispelled much of technique’s familiar magical appeal. Man \nis gradually losing his illusions about technique and his bedazzle- \nment with it. He is becoming aware that he has not created an in­\nstrument of freedom but a new set of chains; this appears with \ncompelling clarity when the state exploits technical instruments. \nMan, however, is still not willing to believe in the reality of this \nnew situation^ he tends to reject, above and beyond bad techni­\ncal uses and doctrines, the results of this conjunction between \nstate and technique.\nBut this rejection is the result of an oversimplification. It is tech­\nnique itself which has changed. Either that, or it has followed its \nown law, a law man was ignorant of at the beginning of this glo­\nrious era. In any case, man sees that technique has changed, but \nhe is unwilling to examine it too closely for fear of losing his last \nhopes.\nTechnique Unchecked. At present there is no counterbalance to \ntechnique. In a society in equilibrium, every new cultural tend­\nency, every new impulse, encounters a certain number of obstacles \nwhich act as the society’s first line of defense. This is not due to \nthe interplay of conservative and revolutionary forces in general, \nnor in particular to the play between the means of production and \nthe organs of consumption. It is rather due to the simple fact that \nevery new factor must be integrated into the cultural framework, \nand this process requires a certain period of time because it en­\ntails modifications of the two interacting elements. It is never \ninitially clear that the new factor will be acceptable to the cultural \ncomplex. On one hand is a kind of process of selection and, on \nthe other, a resistance that gradually abates. A number of different \nforces play this restraining role. I shall discuss four of them.\nThe first is morality. Every civilization has rules of precise con­\nduct, which are covered by the term morality in either its French \nor its Anglo-Saxon meaning. They may be conscious and thought\n\f\n302 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nout, or unconscious and spontaneous. They determine what is good \nand what is bad and, consequently, admit or reject a given in­\nnovation.\nVery close to morality, public opinion comprises a set of much \nmore irrational reactions which are not necessarily related to good \nand evil. For reasons still poorly understood, public opinion may \nbe impelled in a certain direction under the influence of a given \nimpulse, or it may remain refractory. Obviously, public opinion \nis decisive in the interaction between morality and a new factor. \nIt can render morality obsolete or lead it to triumph.\nA third restraining force is social structure, which includes both \nsocial morphology and economic or legal structure. The social \nstructure reacts strongly whenever new factors threaten to modify \nit. (This, incidentally, is the only one of the four factors retained \nby Marxism.) Systems or ideas are no longer the sole operative \nfactors; economic relations or sociological factors can disturb the \nequilibrium even of a situation the stability of which was pre­\nviously thought assured.\nFinally, there is the state, the special organ of defense of a \nsociety, which reacts with every means at its disposal against all \ndisturbing forces.\nWe may now ask what position we are in today with respect to \nthese factors insofar as technique is concerned. Let us put aside \nthe problem of morality and concern ourselves with public opin­\nion It is completely oriented in favor of technique; only technical \nphenomena interest modern men. The machine has made itself \nmaster of the heart and brain both of the average man and of the \nmob. What excites the crowd? Performance— whether perform- \nailP P  In  s n o r ts  (th ft r e s u lt  o f  a  P flr t a in  S irn rtin er fgcbziiQUS) O rA  '  '  “  *  O  1  /\neconomic performance (as in the Soviet Union), in reality these \nare the same thing. Technique is the instrument of performance. \nWhat is important is to go higher and faster, the object of the \nperformance means little. The act is sufficient unto itself. Modem \nman can think only in terms of figures, and the higher the figures, \nthe greater his satisfaction. He looks for nothing beyond the mar­\nvelous escape mechanism that technique has allowed him, to off­\nset the very repressions caused by the life technique forces him \nto lead. He is reduced, in the process, to a near nullity. Even if\n\f\nThe Technological Society (303\nhe is not a worker on the assembly line, his share of autonomy and \nindividual initiative becomes smaller and smaller. He is constrained \nand repressed in thought and action by an omnivorous reality \nwhich is external to him and imposed upon him. He is no longer \npermitted to display any personal power. Then, suddenly, he \nlearns that the airplane his factory manufactures has flown at 700 \nmiles an hour! All his repressed power soars into flight in that \nfigure. Into that record speed he sublimates everything that was \nrepressed in himself. He has gone one step further toward fusion \nwith the mob, for it is the mob as a whole that is moved by a \nperformance that incarnates its will to power. Every modem man \nexpresses his will to power in records he has not established him­\nself.\nPublic opinion is all the more important in that it is a two­\npronged element. In the first place, there is modem man’s col­\nlective worship of the power of fact, which is displayed in every \ntechnique and which is manifested in his total devotion to its over­\nwhelming progress. This adoration is not passive but truly mys­\ntical. Men sacrifice themselves to it and lose themselves in the \nsearch for it. In this sense Mussolini was right in speaking of men \nrealizing themselves in and through the state, the collective in­\nstrument of power. The martyrs of science or of the air force or \nof the atomic pile give us the most profound sense of this worship \nwhen we see the deference the crowd pays them. “I have faith \nin technique,” declared Henry Wallace, the former Secretary of \nCommerce of the United States. His faith indeed dwells in men’s \nhearts. Man is scandalized when he is told that technique causes \nevil; the scourges engendered by one technique will be made good \nby still other techniques. This is society’s normal attitude.\nIn the second place, there is the deep conviction that technical \nproblems are the only serious ones. The amused glance people \ngive the philosopher; the lack of interest displayed in metaphysi­\ncal and theological questions (“Byzantine” quarrels); the rejec­\ntion of the humanities which comes from the conviction that we \nare living in a technical age and education must correspond to it; \nthe search for the immediately practical, carrying the implication \nthat history is useless and can serve no practical ends— all these are \nsymptomatic of that “reasonable” conviction which pervades the\n\f\n304 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nsocial hierarchy and is identical for all social classes. \"Only tech­\nnique is not mere gab.” It is positive and brings about real achieve­\nments.\nIn these two ways, the mystic and the rational, public opinion is \ncompletely oriented toward technique. And at present another pre­\ncise technique molds public opinion with reference to any given \nquestion. This technique has never been fully exploited because \npublic opinion is favorable enough to technique without it. But if \na sudden change should occur and public opinion should turn \nagainst technique, we would see the propaganda machinery set into \nmotion to re-create a favorable atmosphere, for the whole social \nedifice would be at stake.\nAs to the third traditional restraining force— the social structure \n— the question is whether the social structure of our world acts as a \nbrake on technical evolution. By way of answer, I have shown that \nprogress has been rapid only because social morphology has fa­\nvored it. This phenomenon has not fluctuated very much; and at \npresent we are witnessing the penetration of social structure by \ntechniques. The life of the modem world is to an ever greater \ndegree dominated by economics, and economics in turn is more and \nmore dominated by technique. The whole of the material world in \nwhich we live rests on this technical base. (It is a commonplace of \nscience-fiction writers to imagine what would happen if the use of \ntechnical instruments were to be suddenly stopped.) Likewise, our \nanalysis has led us to recognize that as technique progresses in a \ngiven society, it tends to reproduce in that society the social struc­\ntures that gave birth to it\nThe individualist and atomized society of the nineteenth cen­\ntury was, from the sociological point of view, favorable to technical \ndevelopment. Today we are witnessing a kind of technical recon­\nstitution of the scattered fragments of society; communities and \nassociations flourish everywhere. Men seem overjoyed at this crea­\ntion of new social frameworks independent of the state. The social \nsolidification of today contrasts sharply with the fluidity of the \nnineteenth century. Does this phenomenon then present an effec­\ntive opposition to techniques? The answer must be in the negative. \nIf we examine these new sociological forms in detail, we find them \nall organized as functions of techniques. We hardly need to ex­\namine industrial associations, but the same applies to all other\n\f\nThe Technological Society (305\ntwentieth-century associations. They may be associations for sport \nor for culture, the goal of which is clearly recognizable (Dickson). \nThey may be labor unions, which have their characteristic relation \nto life through the economy, this last being conditioned by tech­\nnique. They may be communities like the Kibbutzim, whose object \nis to exploit techniques while allowing man a normal life. In every \nkind of modem society there is a predominance of techniques. The \nsocial morphology of these societies indeed differs radically from \nthat of traditional societies. Traditional societies were centered \nupon human needs and instincts (for example, in family, clan, \nseignory). Modem societies, on the other hand, are centered on \ntechnical necessity and derivatively, of course, on human adher­\nence. Man, in modem societies, is not situated in relation to other \nmen, but in relation to technique; for this reason the sociological \nstructure of these societies is completely altered. There is no \nlonger any question of autonomous collectivities or groups with \nspecific values and orientations. Modem collectivities and groups \nhave no existence beyond technique— they are representative of \nthe major tendency of our time.\nIn the transition from the individualist to the collectivist society, \nthere are then two stages of evolution, both of which are favorable \nto technique, not two different attitudes of society toward tech­\nnique. Comparably, it is clear that collectivist society cannot be \nestablished, or even conceived of, except as growing out of an ex­\ntreme technical development. This might not be true in a com­\nmunal society (although the communities that exist today are \nmarkedly dependent on technique); but we do not seem to be mov­\ning in the direction of such societies.\nHence, we must conclude that our social structures, viewed m \nany light whatsoever, are unanimously favorable to technique and \ncould hardly act as a check upon it.\nOnly the state remains, then, as a possible brake upon technique. \nBut we have already seen that the state has abdicated this function, \nrenouncing its directive role in favor of technique. Indeed, since \nthe nineteenth century every social element which traditionally \nacted as a restraint on innovating forces has been overthrown as far \nas technique is concerned. Inverted might be a better term; the \nfactors which formerly acted as hindrances have today become \npowerful auxiliaries to technique. (W e have only to reflect on pub-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 0 6 )\nlie opinion and the expansion of the economy to realize this.) Tech­\nnique, therefore, encounters no possible obstacles or checks to its \nprogress. It can advance as it will, since it encounters no limiting \nfactors other than its own powers (which seem unlimited and in­\nexhaustible).\nA technique without limits is not in itself disquieting. If we look \nat our technical society without our idealist spectacles, what seems \nmost disquieting is that the character of technique renders it inde­\npendent of man himself. We do not mean by this that the machine \ntends to replace the human being; that fact is already well-known. \nThe important thing is that man, practically speaking, no longer \npossesses any means of bringing action to bear upon technique. \nHe is unable to limit it or even to orient it. I am well acquainted \nwith the claims of those who think that society has technique \nunder firm control because man is always inventing it anew. I \nknow too of the hopes of those who are always prescribing reme­\ndies for this sorcerer’s apprentice whom they feel free to invoke \nwithout discernment. But these claims and hopes are mere words. \nThe reality is that man no longer has any means with which to \nsubjugate technique, which is not an intellectual, or even, as some \nwould have it, a spiritual phenomenon. It is above all a sociological \nphenomenon; and in order to cure or change it, one would have to \noppose to it checks and barriers of a sociological character. By \nsuch means alone man might possibly bring action to bear upon \nit. But everything of a sociological character has had its character \nchanged by technique. There is, therefore, nothing of a sociologi­\ncal character available to restrain technique, because everything \nin society is its servant. Technique is essentially independent of the \nhuman bem ** who finds himself naked and disarmed before it. \nModern man divines that there is only one reasonable way out: to \nsubmit and take what profit he can from what technique otherwise \nso richly bestows upon him. If he is of a mind to oppose it, he finds \nhimself really alone.\nIt has been said that modern man surrounded by techniques is in \nthe same situation as prehistoric man in the midst of nature. This is \nonly a metaphor; it cannot be carried very far, even though it is as \nexact as a metaphor can be. Both environments give life but both \nplace him in utter peril. Both represent terrifying powers, worlds \nin which man is a participant but which are closed against him. In"

He is like a rich \nman of many possessions who finds himself a nonentity in his own \nhousehold. The state, man’s last protector, has made common \ncause with alien powers.\nThe Role of the State in the Development of Modem Technique» . \nThe state plays a role of prime importance with respect to tech­\nniques. We have noted that until recently different techniques \nwere unrelated to one another. This unrelatedness was true of state \ntechniques because they were localized and their domains were \nnot contiguous; it held for private techniques because they were \nthe result of highly uncoordinated activity which, while fruitful, \nwas also anarchical and was dominated, moreover, by specializa­\ntion.\nThe basic effect of state action on techniques is to co-ordinate the \nwhole complex. The state possesses the power of unification, since \nit is the planning power par excellence in society. In this it plays its \ntrue role, that of co-ordinating, adjusting, and equilibrating social \nforces. It has played this role with respect to techniques for half a \ncentury by bringing hitherto unrelated techniques into contact \nwith one another, for example, economic and propaganda tech­\nniques. It. relates them by establishing organisms responsible for \nthis function, as, for example, the simple organs of liaison between \nministries. It integrates the whole complex of techniques into a \nplan. Planning itself is the result of well-applied techniques, and \nonly the state is in a position to establish plans which are valid on \nthe national level. We are, at present, beginning to see plans on a \ncontinental scale, not only the so-called five-year plans, but the \nMarshall Plan and plans for assisting underdeveloped countries.\nIt is only in the framework of planning that such operations are \narranged and find their exact place. The state appears less as the \nbrain which orders them organically and more as the relational \napparatus which enables the separate techniques to confront one \nanother and to co-ordinate their movements. We find concrete \nevidence of this again and again; in the co-ordination of rail and \nautomobile traffic, the co-ordination of the production of steel and \nmotor vehicles and aircraft, in the co-ordination of the medical \nprofession and social security, the co-ordination of foreign and \ncolonial commerce, and of all commerce with finance, and so forth.\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE308)\nThe more closely related the different sectors, the more does a \ndiscovery in one involve repercussions in the others, and the more \nit becomes necessary to create organisms of transmission, cogs and \ngears, so to speak, connecting the different techniques. This is an \nimpossible task for private enterprise, not only because the phe­\nnomenon in question is a global one but because the technicians \nthemselves are specialists. The state alone can undertake the in­\ndispensable task of bridging these specializations. The state knows \napproximately the available resources in men and techniques and \ncan undertake the still embryonic function of co-ordinator. Since \ndiscoveries in one technical sector are so useful in others, the role \nof co-ordinator is bound to become more and more important.\nConsider, for example, the diversity of techniques necessary for \nthe production of a motion picture. There are financial, literary, \nand cinematographic techniques; there are lesser techniques, such \nas make-up techniques and the techniques of light and sound. \nThere are completely new techniques, such as script techniques, \nand so on. These cinematic techniques, though complicated, can \nbe grasped by the brain of a single man, and hence there are still \nsome cases of one-man management. But consider the magnitude \nof the task of co-ordinating, on a national scale, even more compli­\ncated clusters of techniques which offer active resistance to being \nco-ordinated. In such cases the role of organizer, manager, co­\nordinator— whatever it is called— becomes more necessary in pro­\nportion as the state takes over that function. Moreover, the state \nalone can fulfill it. This state of affairs is already a reality; the state \nis already engaged in bridging the isolated technical specialties. \nIndividual specialized disciplines— for example, those of the biolo­\ngist, the engineer, the sociologist, the psychologist— are combined \nto yield new techniques such as psychotechniques and industrial \nrelations. But these individual disciplines are also joined together \nin a more organic way, as, for example, when the so-called human \ntechniques, physics and politics, are combined in propaganda.\nIn addition to co-ordinating the different techniques, the state \nfurnishes material means far beyond the power of any individ­\nuals to supply. An expedition to the North Pole, which only a half \ncentury ago was within the resources of one or at most a few pri­\nvate persons, is no longer possible on a private basis. Formerly all \nthat was needed was Eskimo equipment, such as a boat, sledges,\n\f\nThe Technological Society (309\ndogs— and, above all, courage. Today complicated mechanical \nequipment is necessary: airplanes (especially equipped for the \ncold and for ice landings), caterpillar trucks, radio and radio \ntelephones, prefabricated housing, and so on. Every possible means \nto lessen danger is available to him who dreams of exploring un­\nknown territory. It would doubtless be possible to revive old tradi­\ntions— by risking one's life. But why reject the new means? Why \nendanger one’s life when one can do a better job without that? \nObviously, bravado is unreasonable. One must employ the maxi­\nmum means to assure optimal results with the least danger. But no \nprivate person has the means to set into motion the enormous \napparatus that is needed. The means must be requisitioned by the \nstate, which alone is in a position to find indefinite supplies of \ncash and to exploit financial techniques forbidden to individuals. \nThe same applies in submarine exploration. When one leaves the \ndomain of the merely amateurish and desires to give one’s work \nstatus, legal or otherwise, it is necessary to solicit the support of the \nstate to cover expenses and to resolve administrative problems.\nBut the state demands something in return for subventions. The \nstate does not think it important for an individual to go to the \nNorth Pole, either for sport's sake or for honors. The state desires \ntangible technical results. It agrees to furnish assistance for pur* \nposes of scientific research and for the acquisition of certain rights \nit hopes to exploit; for example, mineral resources and aviation. \nThe result must be the technical aggrandizement of the state; that \nis the only condition under which a contract between state and \nindividual is possible.\nThat the state acts to promote scientific research is not new; in \ndie eighteenth century the state offered recompenses to inventors, \nand these recompenses had much to do with the discovery of cer­\ntain navigational methods (compensating chronometer, mathemat­\nical tables, and so on). The state thereafter seemed to lose interest, \nbut for the last thirty years it has resumed the policy of recompens­\ning technologists and inventors.\nThere are multiple examples of this, for the modern state, to a \ngreater degree than ever before, alone has the means to put to \nwork what technique has to offer man. It suffices to mention agri­\ncultural machinery, automatic threshers and reapers, and so on. \nAlthough in France this machinery is of comparatively small size.\n\f\n3  1 0  ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE\nit is, even so, far beyond the resources of the average individual \nfanner to buy. An intermediary is necessary, either a capitalist \nwho leases machines to the farmers, or a farmer-co-operative \nwhich buys the machines. Yet both of these hesitate to invest the \nrequisite capital because large-scale farm machinery is used only \nfor a small part of the year and is idle the rest of the time. (Such \nmachinery must therefore be deemed technically backward.) \nAirplanes are being used increasingly for sowing, seeding clouds \nfor rain, distributing chemical substances, and so on. But these \ntechniques exceed the resources of peasant co-operatives.\nThere are only two ways to resolve the situation. One is to ex­\npropriate the land in favor of capitalist corporations which will ex­\nploit vast areas with the latest technical improvements. The other \nis to unite the farmers in state collective farms which would have \nat their disposal instruments furnished by the state. A choice is still \npossible between the two alternatives. But almost certainly the \nbalance will swing in favor of state collectives; only through state \ncollectives can technical progress be fully realized and technical \nmeans exploited without fear of financial setbacks.\nThe state offers technique possibilities of development which no \nOther agency could offer. It gives research men the necessary \nmeans to expedite their research, and, as a consequence, to expe­\ndite technique. Only the state is in a position to make available to \nscientists the results of scientific investigations from other parts of \nthe world; the state can exploit information techniques which no \nlesser agency could possibly exploit. It can buy necessary new \ninstruments in any country. It even lures foreign scientists into its \nlaboratories with hard cash (it may even kidnap them into semi­\nslavery, as in the case of the German scientists who were “distrib­\nuted” among the victorious Allies). Only the state can purchase \nessential scientific equipment and, in addition, give the scientist \nthe indispensable support of its authority.\nTechnique, as I have remarked, has no meaning if it is not ap­\nplied. But in its application it encounters certain concrete difficul­\nties, especially with individuals. This in no way contradicts what \nI have already said about public opinion. Public opinion is com­\npletely and resolutely favorable to technical progress. But it is fa­\nvorable retrospectively, so to speak. Technical progress is what \nwe already know. In actual instances, however— in respect to some\n\f\nThe Technological Society (311\nnew discovery, for example— the reaction of the public is not so \nsimple. If a discovery does not concern the public directly, its re­\naction is generally enthusiastic, as, for example, in the case of \nsupersonic aircraft. But if the public is directly affected, if the dis­\ncovery may in fact be applied to it, enthusiasm is notably dimin­\nished, the more so because there is always a difference of opinion \namong the technicians themselves. Here the state intervenes. In \ninnumerable cases it has had to resolve the quarrels of technicians \nand scientists, as formerly it resolved the debates of theologians. \nRecall the strife concerning the antitubercular vaccines of Cal­\nmette and Guerin; also the reservations of some scientists concern­\ning the “polyvalent vaccination” which is now obligatory in France. \nThe state alone decided what was to be done in these cases. More­\nover, the state clothed its opinion in its authority, which, in a short \ntime, became the authority of the technician. Where necessary, \nauthority was reinforced by compulsion. A complicated system \ndeveloped. The child who has not been vaccinated cannot be ad­\nmitted to school; and the child who does not attend school has no \nright to family subsidies. Thus the state overcomes the objections \nof individuals to technical progress. Friedmann writes: “It is \nclear that in a society in which the psychotechnician’s important \ntask is not invested with the authority of the state . . .  his position \nis ambiguous and his recommendations do not always have the \nweight they should.” And Friedmann goes on to remark that state \nauthority frees technique from the grip of private persons. \nThrough the authority of the state, technique is no longer at the \nservice of private interests; and this gives the state, if not real \nfreedom, at least additional justification.\nThe authority with which the state invests technique becomes \na factor in its development. But it ought not to be forgotten that \nthis state has itself become technical; it does not act on whim. \nInstitutions in the Service of Technique. The state then proceeds \nto create organs to meet the demands of technique, and here arise a \nnumber of possibilities.\nThe system created in France involves a certain decentralization. \nThe CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research) is fairly au­\ntonomous. But it is necessary right off to dispel a misunderstanding. \nThe name includes the word scientific, but the work of the Center is \nis above all ebe technical. However, the persons who created and\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 * * )\nwho champion the work of the Center associate the two concepts \nvery closely. Consider the statement of Louis de Broglie and \nFrederic Joliot-Curie: “For France it is not a question of maintain­\ning scientific and technical research in spite of the fact that the na­\ntion is poor; it is a question of developing it, precisely because the \nnation is poor.\" This statement, incidentally, confirms my conclu­\nsion about the exploitation of the nation by the technicians. Scien­\ntific research is justified in a poor country because it produces \ncertain techniques which permit more complete use of the coun­\ntry’s resources.\nThis sheds light on the real meaning of scientific work. Science \nis becoming more and more subordinate to the search for technical \napplication. Numerous scientists, who are attached to the labora­\ntories of the CNRS and with whom I am personally acquainted, \nhave confirmed to me its preoccupation with results and its empha­\nsis on technical investigations. The CNRS is not an institution for \ndisinterested and objective research nor is it a purely cultural \nentity. It represents a further step toward the union between the \nscientific and the technical. We must recognize, however, that the \nFrench state still does not understand exactly what is to be ex­\npected from this union.\nThe politicians distrust the technicians; the petty war which is \nbeing fought between them over the CNRS is another example of \nthe competition I have described. Biquard, chef de cabinet of the \nUndersecretary of State for Scientific Research, has written that \nthe reason lor which the CNRS ought to remain independent of the \nNational Ministry of Education is that “The tasks of the CNRS—  \nrecruitment, training, equipment, co-ordination, organization, and \nmanagement— are sufficiently heavy to justify the existence of an \nadministration appropriate to scientific research; an administration \nin which scientists ought to play the most important role.”\nThis quotation discloses two things: first, that this state organ \nperforms with respect to technique precisely the functions we have \nalready indicated: co-ordination, organization, and management; \nsecond, that in it technicians must play the principal role, to the \nexclusion of politicians represented by the National Ministry of \nEducation.\nBut the creation of the CNRS is clearly only a first step. It repre­\nsents a commitment; and i t is impossible to stop there. The demo-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3*3\ncratic state has proved to be clearly unequal to the task of develop­\ning techniques, and the CNRS does not have the prestige or the \nmeans it would possess in an authoritarian state. In comparison \nwith the authoritarian state, of course, the CNRS is still relatively \nfree in its activities and its research. Although its general orienta­\ntion is toward the technical application of discoveries, certain pos­\nsibilities ( incidentally, more and more restricted) are still left men \nfor pure research which cannot in principle terminate in immedi­\nate application. The well-known margin of unpredictability in \nresearch is thus protected. Which discoveries are susceptible of \napplicability is never known in advance. Research is blind; it ad­\nvances gropingly and by means of a thousand experiments which \nmiscarry. One experiment will make a breach and allow an ex­\nplosive technical advance. But the thousand fruitless experiments \nwere nevertheless necessary. We recognize this. But— and this is \nthe important thing— technical exigence is dead set against science \nin this respect, because technique cannot tolerate the gropings and \nslowtempoof science.\nWe have already examined the requirement of immediate appli­\ncability; here we meet it again on the state level. The state is not \ndisinterested any more than private capitalists, but it is concerned \nin a different way. The state claims to represent the public interest \nand hence to have the duty of being a “good manager,” dispensing \nthe public revenues only on condition that they mean something, \nthat they pay off. Disinterested activity on the part of the state is \ninconceivable. Some may say that such activity should not be im­\npossible; but in fact it is impossible. Neither individuals nor public \nopinion nor the structure of the state is oriented toward the ac­\nceptance of the kind of culture pure scientific research would \nrepresent.\nThe state demands that anything scientific enter into the line of \n“normal” development, not only for the sake of the public interest \nbut also because of its will to power. We have previously noted \nthat this will to power has found in technique an extraordinary \nmeans of expression. The state quickly comes to demand that tech­\nnique keep its promises and be an effective servant of state power. \nEverything not of direct interest to this drive for power appears \nvalueless. Just as financiers seek their interest in money profit, the \nstate seeks it in power. In neither case is the motivation disinter-\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 *4 )\nested; technical discovery must pay off. Capitalists and state alike \nbecome impatient at delays in research, at experiments which a \npriori \"lead to nothing,” and at the “uncertainty” of the scientist \nwhen he indulges in pure research without knowing in advance \nwhich research will pay off and which will not. Moreover, the \ntendency is to eliminate from the legitimate concerns of the state \nall sciences that have no immediate practical application: history, \nphilosophy, grammar, and so on.\nIn the case of sciences susceptible of practical application, there \nis an immediate demand for this application. This is, of course, un­\nfavorable to science; but it must not be imagined that it is the work\nof imbeciles.\nThe state begins by assigning a precise task to scientific research, \nissuing directives to the effect that it must find solutions for certain \npressing problems, for example, a more rapid method to produce a \npart of a machine, a jet engine for aircraft, and so on. These direc­\ntives are veritable commands to scientific research to summon all \nits resources to solve the problems as soon as possible. In a demo­\ncratic system there are no sanctions against scientists who fail to \nfulfill the state’s demands, except suppression of financial support \nA dictatorial regime, however, goes very much further to secure \nthe compliance of the scientists. Even though it still leaves a rather \nbroad area to personal initiative, it nevertheless tends more and \nmore to become specific on this score. This is evident in different \nways both in the Soviet Union and in the United States.\nIn the Soviet Union the Academy of Sciences appears to be the \nstate organism which directs research and determines the frame­\nwork in which scientific activities will be carried out. The Acad­\nemy constitutes the \"general staff of the army of technicians.” \nArticle %  of the statutes, definitively fixed in 1935, charged it with \nproviding for the “progress of the theoretical and applied sciences.\" \nBut the technical sciences administered by the Soviet Academy \nhave ceaselessly outstripped the theoretical sciences. The Acad­\nemy plans the course of research and assigns objectives to the in­\nstitutes. On the initiative of the Academy, the education of higher \ntechnicians has been accelerated; in i960 the Soviet Union claimed \nto have 7,500,000 technicians of all classes. The Academy directs \nmore than twenty institutes for research in applied science, em-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (315\nploying altogether 2,000 researchers. One of its institutes \n(the Institute for Information) is charged with collating the tech­\nnical publications of the entire world; for this task alone it employs \n2,000 people full-time. All this makes it clear that the Academy \nplays an important role in technical activities. The system, how­\never is on the whole poorly understood. It would appear to \nbe less authoritarian than the Nazi system. But one should not \nforget the decision of the state, on the initiative of the Communist \nParty, in the Lysenko affair. Here the state, faced with two op­\nposed biogenetic theories, decided for scarcely scientific reasons \nthat Lysenko’s theory was true and ordered its application forth­\nwith.\nThe Gosplan,’ whose function is essentially to co-ordinate new \nscientific elements, is closely related to the Academy. The Gosplan \nis kept informed by the Academy about technical discoveries, and \nmaintains a central file of all data of economic and statistical tech­\nniques. In this way, a systematic and rational evaluation of scien­\ntific research is possible, the results of which are then integrated \ninto the state plan itself. In the reform of 1946, in which co-ordinat­\ning bureaus took the place of the former district offices, a technical \nbureau was set up whose function was to plan scientific research. \nAt present this research is being directed on the basis of the over-all \nplan and of the needs of the state, and the whole is evaluated from \nthe point of view of the individual techniques. The technical bur­\neau channels research by distributing financial credit of great \nmagnitude; for example, in 1949 it allocated approximately 10 \nbillion rubles to scientific research, a sum equivalent to 20 per cent \nof all budgeted industrial investment.\nThe organization of scientific research in the United States is still \nfar from complete. There are, in principle, private entities which \nperform research in all imaginable domains— such as the various \ncommittees for political research, committees for social research, \nand so on. In addition, there are entities for gathering and evaluat­\ning statistics, for polling public opinion, and for the study of policy. \nCloser and closer relations are being established among these en­\ntities, which for the most part have been set up either by private\n* The Soviet State Planning Agency. ( Trans.)\n\f\nTECHNIQUE AND TH E STATE3 * 6 )\nindustry or by the state and then attached to the universities. \n(Seventy per cent of these entities have been set up by the large \ncorporations.)\nIt is standard procedure for public services in need of informa­\ntion to have recourse to these research centers. Specialized bureaus \nhave also been set up to handle relations between research organi­\nzations and the public services. These bureaus receive requests in \nall areas (agricultural, industrial, and so on) and orient research. \nSubsequently, they act as transmission media for discoveries, and \nstudy the possibilities of technical adaptation. Then the appro­\npriate administrations are in a position to make contracts with the \nindustrialists charged with practical implementation.\nTechnical operations of this kind and scope become more and \nmore necessary as the state finances technical investigations to a \ngreater and greater degree. The state is compelled to finance re­\nsearch which exceeds the financial means of, say, the universities. \nThe state has direct interest, therefore, in such institutions; it will \ntherefore not leave unexploited the possibilities thus uncovered. \nAll this means a much freer movement among government, in­\ndustry, and technical research centers than would otherwise be the \ncase.\nIn addition, the American state has organized research services \nof its own. The Bureau of the Census, for example, encompasses \nmore than fifteen centers of statistical studies. The National Re­\nsources Planning Board, which existed from 1923 to was an­\nother such center. There are today other much more specialized \nagencies, the most comprehensive of which is the Atomic Energy \nCommission. The government owns the laboratories and furnishes \nthe raw materials and equipment, but the actual research of the \nCommission is conducted by universities and by private industry. \nThe Associated Universities, Inc., operates the Brookhaven National \nLaboratories; Union Carbide operates Oak Ridge; the University \nof California operates Los Alamos; and General Electric operates \nthe center at Hanford.\nFinally, it might be mentioned that the United States feels a  \nstrong need to co-ordinate the research carried out by the different \nagencies. Two associations seem fitted for this operation, the Public \nService Administration and the Government Research Association. \nIn due course, the work of these agencies will result in the realiza-"

Moreover, the greatest part of the \nfunds devoted by corporations to research goes into technical re­\nsearch. Only 4 per cent goes into basic scientific research. When, \nafter the Steelman report of 1947 and certain public statements of \nEinstein, it seemed indispensable to promote scientific research, the \nstate was appealed to, and in 1951 the state created the National \nScience Foundation. When, in the wake of the Sputnik, a new \nreport (the Waterman report) made a new appeal for state inter­\nvention, the state responded by creating the post of an adviser to \nthe President for science and technology, a National Scientific \nCommittee, and so on. These events imply a greater and greater de­\ngree of intervention. Scientific and technical competition between \nthe United States and the Soviets must inevitably produce centrali­\nzation and growth of political power in the United States. It seems \nimpossible therefore that independent research can survive; a sys­\ntem such as Zweckwissenschaft (“practical or purposive science,\" \nwhich the Nazis applied too soon) will gradually take over. In it \nthere is no longer any question of free research. The state mobilizes \nall technicians and scientists, and imposes on all a precise and \nlimited technical objective.

It forbids all research which it deems not to be in \nits own interests and institutes only that research which has utility. \nEverything is subordinated to the idea of service and utility.

On the other hand, the Nazis’ “directed” research \nproduced impressive results. In the case of tanks, V i and V2 \nmissiles, and the heavy water bomb, in the fields of surgery, optics, \nand chemistry (not to speak of organization or agricultural meth­\nods), Zweckwissenschaft seems to have had rapid and efficient \nresults.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER\nDO\nHUMAN\nTECHNIQUES\nThe last techniques to make their appearance are those which re­\nlate directly to the human being. They are today the subject of \ngreat discoveries— and great hopes. We hear everywhere: “They \nwill save everything.” Before we study them, let us inquire why \nthey have appeared.\nNecessities\nHuman Tension. Never before has so much been required of the \nhuman being. By chance, in the course of history some men have \nhad to perform crushing labors or expose themselves to mortal \nperiL But those men were slaves or warriors. Never before has the \nhuman race as a whole had to exert such efforts in its daily labors \nas it does today as a result of its absorption into the monstrous \ntechnical mechanism— an undifferentiated but complex mechanism \nwhich makes it impossible to turn a wheel without the sustained, \npersevering, and intensive labor of millions of workers, whether in \nwhite collars or in blue. The tempo of man’s work is not the tradi-\n\f\nHUM AN TECHNIQUES320)\ntional, ancestral tempo; nor is its aim the handiwork which man \nproduced with pride, the handiwork in which he contemplated and \nrecognized himself.\nI shall not write (after all, so many others already have) about \nthe difference between conditions of work today and in the past—  \nhow today’s work is less fatiguing and of shorter duration, on the \none hand, but, on the other, is an aimless, useless, and callous busi­\nness, tied to a clock, an absurdity profoundly felt and resented by \nthe worker whose labor no longer has anything in common with \nwhat was traditionally called work.\nThis is true today even for the peasantry. The important thing, \nhowever, is not that work is in a sense harsher than formerly, but \nthat it calls for different qualities in man. It implies in him an ab­\nsence, whereas previously it implied a presence. This absence is \nactive, critical, efficient; it engages the whole man and supposes \nthat he is subordinated to its necessity and created for its ends.\nThis is the first time in history that man has been so affected in \nso many untraditional ways. Carried along by events, he has been \nplunged into war at periodic intervals. But today’s war is total war, \na unique and unbelievable phenomenon. It is the onus and concern \nof all men. It subjects everyone to the same way of life, puts every­\none on a level with everyone else, and threatens everyone with \nthe same death. Under its sway men have to endure unheard of \nsufferings and fatigue. War is now beyond human endurance in \nnoise, movement, enormity of means, and precision of machines; \nand man himself has become merely an object, an object to be \nkilled, and prey to a permanent panic that he is unable to translate \ninto personal action. Man is subjected by modem war to a nervous \ntension, a psychic pressure, and an animal submission which are \nbeyond human power to support. But, involved and committed \nto the machine, he does contrive to support all this, admirable ma­\nchine that he isl In the process, however, he is stretched to the \nlimit of his resistance, like a steel cable which may break at any \nmoment.\nThe conditions of war may still be abnormal and exceptional. \nNevertheless, even four or five years of war are significant in the \nlife of a man. And the conditions of war eventually become very \nnearly his daily state; for the “abnormal” and the “exceptional,” \nwith a somewhat lesser intensity, are reproduced regularly during\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 3 * 1\nthe course of each day. Man was made to do his daily work with \nhis muscles; but see him now, like a fly on flypaper, seated for \neight hours, motionless at a desk. Fifteen minutes of exercise can* \nnot make up for eight hours of absence. The human being was \nmade to breathe the good air of nature, but what he breathes is an \nobscure compound of acids and coal tars. He was created for a \nliving environment, but he dwells in a lunar world of stone, cement, \nasphalt, glass, cast iron, and steel. The trees wilt and blanch among \nsterile and blind stone facades. Cats and dogs disappear little by \nlittle from the city, going the way of the horse. Only rats and men \nremain to populate a dead world. Man was created to have room \nto move about in, to gaze into far distances, to live in rooms which, \neven when they were tiny, opened out on fields. See him now, \nenclosed by the rules and architectural necessities imposed by over­\npopulation in a twelve-by-twelve closet opening out on an anony* \nmous world of city streets.\nEvery man is in this fix, not merely the proletariat, and nothing \ncan be done about it. What was once the abnormal has become \nthe usual, standard condition of things. Even so, the human being \nis ill at ease in this strange new environment, and the tension de­\nmanded of him weighs heavily on his life and being. He seeks to \nflee— and tumbles into the snare of dreams; he tries to comply—  \nand falls into the life of organizations; he feels maladjusted— and \nbecomes a hypochondriac. But the new technological society has \nforesight and ability enough to anticipate these human reactions. It \nhas undertaken, with the help of techniques of every kind, to make \nsupportable what was not previously so, and not, indeed, by modi­\nfying anything in man’s environment but by taking action upon \nman himself. Psychology is resorted to more and more; everybody \nknows how important morale isl Man can support the harshest and \nmost inhumane living conditions, provided his morale holds. In­\nnumerable psychological examples and experiments confirm this.\nIn a world where technique demands the utmost of men, this \nmaximum cannot be attained, maintained, or surpassed— as some­\ntimes is required— except by a will that is always steady and taut. \nMan does not by nature possess such a will. He is by no means \nnaturally prepared for such a sublime condition, and if he some­\ntimes does attain to it naturally, the exaltation endures only a few \nmoments. Yet it must be prolonged. Psychological conditions must\n\f\n3 3  2 )  HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nbe created to enable the individual to give his utmost to war (or \npeace) and to resist prostration and discouragement in the face of \nthe dreadful conditions of life into which technique has forced \nhim.\nAt the beginning of 1914, a short war was predicted; the morale \nof the troops, it was said, could not endure a long one. The same \nprophecy was made in 1941 at the beginning of the all-out bom­\nbardment of Germany; human beings, it was said, could not long \nendure such a pounding. In 1917 it was announced that the misery \nattendant on the Russian Revolution would soon bring about the \ncollapse of Communism. None of these predictions came true; \nmorale, and morale alone, sustained human stability. Depending \non the side men adhered to, they glorified faith in Hitler, their \ncountry, Communism. But it was not a question of faith; it was \nreally a question of an extremely efficient technique of morale \nbuilding designed to make the insupportable supportable. Between \nthe intensive Allied bombardment and the intensive German prop­\naganda, the German propaganda carried the day. The Strategic \nBombing Service of the Americans was forced to conclude that, \ndespite all the bombardments, there was by 1944 no noticeable \nlowering of industrial production and that the German workers \nwere working with the same enthusiasm as before.\nConversely, when psychological motivation is lacking, industrial \nproduction immediately falls. Man is able to endure famine, dis­\ncomfort, and the most abnormal conditions; he can make in t e n s iv e  \nand lasting efforts, provided he is psychologically doped. Our so­\nciety places him in a position in which he is always near the break­\ning point and demands just such effort of him. In order that he not \nbreak down or lag behind (precisely what technical progress f o r ­\nbids), he must be furnished with psychic forces he does not have \nin himself, which therefore must come from elsewhere. This is \nsometimes a very simple matter, as, for example, with the system \nof the “self-arresting” production line. When, through fatigue or \ndiscontent, one of the workers lags behind the others who have \nfinished their operation, the production line comes to a halt and \nthe other workers are obliged to pause. According to Friedmann, \n“the lagging worker sees that he is keeping his fellows from earning \nthe wages they might earn. He feels guilty toward them, and this \nfeeling acts as a psychological stimulant which effectively compels\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 3 * 3\nhim to resume the collective tempo in spite of fatigue or discon­\ntent\" These psychological stimulants are innumerable and are very \noften the spontaneous product of the conditions of life. Ideologies \nare a good example. I am not alluding here to political ideologies, \nbut to a whole complex of ideologies of a much more restricted \nkind such as are to be found in the Readers Digest.\nTechnique, then, brings its own ideology; and every technical \nrealization engenders its own ideological justifications. A recent \nstudy of the Tennessee Valley Authority by Wengert examines this \nphenomenon in detail. The TVA originally was an exclusively tech­\nnical program to develop hydraulic power and prevent dangerous \nflooding. The program was carried out and the power generated \nwas duly distributed to neighboring localities. It proved to be a \nprofitable venture, in spite of what some people may say about it. \nIn the beginning the TVA did not have cultural implications. But \neven before the program yielded concrete results, the myth began \nto develop, and today the TVA has become a symbol of regionalism \nin the United States. To it is ascribed the function of co-ordinating \nand integrating diverse activities; a role in the methodical develop­\nment of natural resources; a task of decentralization affecting pub­\nlic and private federal and local institutions; and even a mission of \neducation. We hear of “democracy on the march\" and other such \npanegyrics. But nothing in this myth corresponds to facts; it is a \nset of ideological constructions which do indeed start from con­\ncrete, technical, and true facts. But these facts in no way imply \nsuch constructions. Mythical constructions such as these lie in the \nrealm of those moral fables for which politicians, economists, and \nsociologists are often responsible. The press and the radio then \ntake up these fictions and popularize them; and the public, always \nuneasy about its failure to find solutions to the problems perpetually \ndinned into its ears, falls eagerly upon what seems to be a solution \nand gives it currency.\nAt such a moment an ideology is born and, in the democratic \ncountries, becomes public opinion. After the public has taken it up, \nother technical schemes are elaborated on the basis of the myth. \nThus, as a function of ideologies in no way implied by the TVA, \ncorresponding programs were proposed for the Missouri River. \nBut the correspondence is mere appearance.\nNot technique but man is responsible for this wholesale manu-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3* 4 )\nfacture of symbols. Perhaps it is closer to the truth to say that the \ncontact between man and technique brings this about, of necessity. \nIt is literally impossible for the public to believe that so much ef­\nfort and intelligence, so many dazzling results, produce only ma­\nterial effects. People simply cannot admit tliat a great dam produces \nnothing but electricity. The myth of the dam in France springs from \nthe fact that mass man worships his own massive works and can­\nnot bring himself to attribute to them a merely material value. \nMoreover, since these works involve immense sacrifices, it is neces­\nsary to justify the sacrifices ( a fact I shall return to in my study of \npropaganda). In short, man creates for himself a new religion of a \nrational and technical order to justify his work and to be justified \nin it The mechanism of the TVA affords a remarkable example of \nthis process.\nIt is thus possible through psychological means to draw from man \nhis last measure of effort and at the same time compel him to bear \nup under the disadvantages with which the new society hinders \nhim. This is the first goal of psychological techniques. The only \nthing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of \ntechnique; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization \nof human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation \nof all human psychic forces.\nAfter these reflections, we cannot accept the often quoted state­\nment: \"The effort to increase production must cease when the \nequilibrium of the whole man is endangered.” This statement \nwould be acceptable if equilibrium were stable or static. But what \ndoes equilibrium mean when it is possible to re-create it more or \nless arbitrarily by purely artificial means? What can limits mean \nwhen psychological devices make it possible to push back all limits? \nA fixed structure no longer exists for man. We exact of him what \nhe would never yield of himself. The machine allows him to com­\nply with the material demands made upon him and psychological \nmanipulation permits it spiritually. The modification of the human \npsyche that results from the interrelation of all techniques makes \nnonsense of the statement quoted. The equilibrium of the whole \nman? The technical society is capable of re-creating man as a very \ndifferent whole from what he was a century ago. It is able to re­\nestablish “equilibrium” at a higher or lower point ( according to the\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 2 5\ncriteria employed); but, in any case, to establish it at a different \nlevel from the one maintained before the technical era.\nModification of the Milieu and Space. Technique has penetrated \nthe deepest recesses of the human being. The machine tends not \nonly to create a new human environment, but also to modify man’s \nvery essence. The milieu in which he lives is no longer his. He \nmust adapt himself, as though the world were new, to a universe \nfor which he was not created. He was made to go six kilometers an \nhour, and he goes a thousand. He was made to eat when he was \nhungry and to sleep when he was sleepy; instead, he obeys a clock. \nHe was made to have contact with living things, and he lives in a \nworld of stone. He was created with a certain essential unity, and \nhe is fragmented by all the forces of themodern world.\nAdmittedly, the machine has enriched man as it has changed \nhim. The machine’s senses and organs have multiplied the powers \nof human senses and organs, enabling man to penetrate a new \nmilieu and revealing to him unknown sights, liberties, and servi­\ntudes. He has been liberated little by little from physical con­\nstraints, but he is all the more the slave of abstract ones. He acts \nthrough intermediaries and consequently has lost contact with \nreality. The interested reader may wish to consult Friedmann's \nadmirable work concerning the separation of the worker from his \nmaterial. Man as worker has lost contact with the primary element \nof life and environment, the basic material out of which he makes \nwhat he makes. He no longer knows wood or iron or wool. He is \nacquainted only with the machine. His capacity to become a me­\nchanic has replaced his knowledge of his material; this develop­\nment has occasioned profound mental and psychic transformations \nwhich cannot yet be assessed.\nMen with scientific knowledge of materials are found only in \nresearch institutes. But they never use these materials or see them \nand have merely an abstract knowledge of their properties. The \nmen who actually use the materials to produce a finished product \nno longer know them. They follow engineering specifications, using \nthe only object they will ever know firsthand: the machine. Even \nso, it cannot be said that man is adapted to the machine. The pilot \nof the supersonic aircraft at its maximum velocity becomes, in a \nsense, completely one with his machine. But immobilized in a net-\n\f\n3 2 6 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nwork of tubes and ducts, he is deaf, blind, and impotent. His senses \nhave been replaced by dials which inform him what is taking place. \nBuilt into his helmet, for example, is an electroencephalographic \napparatus which can warn him of an imminent rarefaction of oxy­\ngen before his senses could have told him. We can say he “subsists” \nin abnormal conditions; but we cannot say he is adapted to them \nin any really human sense. And his situation is not exceptional.\nIt is not only in work (which takes up a great part of his life) \nthat man encounters this transformation. His environment as a \nwhole— everything that goes to make up his milieu, his livelihood, \nhabitat, and habits— is modified. The machine has transformed \nwhatever is most immediately connected with him: home, furni­\nture, food. His dwelling place becomes more and more mecha­\nnized, like a factory, through an extreme division of labor and the \norganization of housework. Catherine Esther Beecher’s1  analysis \nof the domestic function caused many people to feel sympathetic \nin some degree toward the systematization of housework in the \nnineteenth century, even though it seemed strange at first. Since \nthe thirties, however, the systematic organization of kitchen space \nhas been completely accepted, with its three \"centers” of work (for \npreparation, cooking, and washing), along with the “taylorization” \nof the motions of cooking. Technical rigor has penetrated into the \ndomain of the unco-ordinated, the unconsidered, the individual, \nand has resulted in the avoidance of motion, steps, time, and \nfatigue. It has also put the housewife into a laboratory, into a \nminutely ordered network of relentless motions representing slav­\nery a thousandfold more exacting than anything she knew in the \npast. It is useless to insist on this point. France is on the threshold \nof this transformation; it is already far advanced in the United \nStates. Even the most superficial observers can see that this trans­\nformation of housework by the machine has brought about a com­\npletely different style of living. Wife and children no longer fulfill \ntheir traditional function. A new relation exists between husband \nand wife and between parent and child. The “hearth” no longer \nhas any meaning, and the patient building of family relations no \nraison d’etre. A different state of mind necessarily corresponds to\n1  M iss Beecher (1800-78) wrote extensively on education for wom en. She held that \nwom an's domestic function was paramount and for this reason opposed female \nsuffrage. (Trans.)\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 *7\na radically different state of affairs. But what state of mind? As yet, \nno one seems to know. One’s first reaction is simply to say: \"No \nstate of mind.”\nThe machine is modifying household furnishings to an ever \ngreater degree. The interested reader is referred to Siegfried \nGiedion’s work, which describes not only this modification of \nhousehold furniture but also the modification of the whole struc­\nture of housing. Giedion’s conclusion is that mechanization is \"tyr­\nannizing over housing.” Furniture and housing must of course \ncomply with the necessities of mass production. Both must undergo \nmodification because of the mechanization of household interiors; \na house must be conceived less for the comfort of its occupants \nthan for the accommodation of the numerous mechanical gadgets \nto be installed in it.\nIn a different area of private life, there is the wide range of ef­\nfects mechanization has had upon food, for example, through the \nvarious new methods of preservation and storage. I. have already \nmentioned the profound modification of bread, which has become \na chemical substance of very different composition from that pro­\nduced from simple cereal grains.. Beginning with Sylvester Gra­\nham’s Treatise on Bread, a number of studies have shown to what \ndegree the organic structure of bread has been modified by the \nmachine and by the science of chemistry. The result was a pro­\nfound modification of taste, as if “the consumers, by an unconscious \nreaction, adapted their taste to the type of bread which corre­\nsponded exactly to the demands of mass production.” Mechaniza­\ntion shattered the age-old character of bread and con verted it into a \nvalueless article of fashion. This statement is not an aesthetic judg­\nment or a lingering romanticism, but rather the result of exact tech­\nnical studies, a technical fact established by technicians; this in it­\nself presupposes it is not a value judgment. We are registering a fact \nand not nostalgia for the old whole-wheat bread of our ancestors. \nIt is a fact of the same order as the retreat of wine before Coca- \nCola; the ancient “civilization of wine” is becoming obsolescent as \na result of an industrial product\nJust as material surroundings— the nearest, humblest, and most \npersonal— have been modified, so have the broader and more ab­\nstract elements of life. Work, rest, and food, and time, space, and \nmovement as well, no longer have any connection with traditional\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 *8 )\nforms. It is commonly said that with the new modes of transport \ndistance no longer exists; and, indeed, man has vanquished space. \nHe is able to travel about the entire globe. He meets men of other \nraces. He becomes a cosmopolite and a citizen of the world, less, \nit may be added, through his own will and ideals than through the \nmechanical fact of easy transport.\nBut only a small minority of people use airlines, enter into rela­\ntions with the world, and see space stretch out before them. For \nthe overwhelming majority, although space has not remained tra­\nditional, it has undergone an inverse evolution. The world’s popula­\ntion has increased tenfold in a very short time. In particular, the \npopulation of France has almost trebled in a century and a half, \nso that we have, in effect, only one third the amount of room per \ncapita that we formerly had. No longer are there any lonely moun­\ntains and deserted seacoasts. Solitude is no longer possible; space \nis at such a premium that men jostle one another everywhere. Quite \napart from the solitude of relaxation, we no longer have even the \nnormal solitude which implies sufficient space to live other than as \nif in a prison cell or at a factory workbench. Living and working \ntraditionally meant open space, a no man’s land separating a man \nfrom his fellows. But there is no longer any possibility of that.\nMan has always known wide horizons. Even the city dweller had \ndirect contact with limitless plains, mountains, and seas. Beyond \nthe enclosing walls of the medieval city, was open country. At most \nthe citizen had to walk five hundred yards to reach the city walls, \nwhere space, fair and free, suddenly extended before him. Today \nman knows only bounded horizons and reduced dimensions. The \nspace not only of his movements but of his gaze is shrinking. The \nparadox is characteristic of our times, that to the abstract conquest \nof Space by Man (capitalized) corresponds the limitation of place \nfor men (in small letters). It is scarcely necessary to emphasize \nthe fact that this diminution of Lebensraum results indirectly from \ntechniques (through population growth) or directly from them \n(through urban and industrial agglomeration).\nModification of Time and Motion. In much the same way tech­\nnique has modified human time. That man until recently got along \nwell enough without measuring time precisely is something we \nnever even think about, and that we do not think about it shows \nto what a degree we have been affected by technique. What means\n\f\nTheTechnological Society ( 329\nthere were in the past for measuring time belonged to the rich and, \nuntil the fourteenth century, exerted no influence on real time or \non life. Until then, there were mechanical horologia which did not \nso much mark the hour as indicate it very approximately by bells \nor chimes. The clocktower, with its public clock, made its appear­\nance toward the end of the century. Until then, time had been \nmeasured by life’s needs and events. At most, life had been regu­\nlated since the fifth century by church bells; but this regulation \nreally followed a psychological and biological tempo. The time \nman guided himself by corresponded to nature’s time; it was ma­\nterial and concrete. It became abstract (probably toward the end \nof the fourteenth century) when it was divided into hours, minutes, \nand seconds. Little by little this mechanical kind of time, with its \nknife-edge divisions, penetrated, along with machinery, into hu­\nman life. The first private clocks appeared in the sixteenth century. \nThenceforward, time was an abstract measure separated from the \ntraditional rhythms of life and nature. It became mere quantity. \nBut since life is inseparable from time, life too was forced to submit \nto the new guiding principle. From then on, life itself was measured \nby the machine; its organic functions obeyed the mechanical. Eat­\ning, working, and sleeping were at the beck and call of machinery. \nTime, which had been the measure of organic sequences, was \nbroken and dissociated. Human life ceased to be an ensemble, a \nwhole, and became a disconnected set of activities having no other \nbond than the fact that they were performed by the same indi­\nvidual.1  Mechanical abstraction and rigidity permeated the whole \nstructure of being. “Abstract time became a new milieu, a new \nframework of existence.” Today the human being is dissociated \nfrom the essence of life; instead of living time, he is split up and \nparceled out by it. Lewis Mumford is right in calling the dock \nthe most important machine of our culture. And he is right too in \nasserting that the clock has made modern progress and efficiency \npossible through its rapidity of action and the co-ordination it ef-\n* Enrico Castelli'i study Le Temps harcelant extends our observations in to  the realm \nof the psychological. He show s how the m an of the technical world lives without \npast or future and how the loss of the sense of duration deprives law and language \nof their m eaning. According to Castelli, m odern m an lives in a universe in  which \ntechnique has divested language of its m eaning and value. If this formula seem s \nexaggerated, I would direct you to Castelli’s book, to see its essential truth.\nThe book stresses the fact that technique, as a result of the perfection of meats \nwhich it has placed at the disposal of m odern m an, has effectively suppressed the\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES330 )\nfects in man’s daily activities. All organization of work and study of \nmotion is based on the clock.\nThere is a third general, nonmaterial element of human life \nwhich, along with space and time, has been profoundly modified \nby technique: motion. Here, too, we observe the same process. \nMotion is the spontaneous expression of life, its visible form. Every­\nthing alive chooses of itself its attitudes, orientations, gestures, and \nrhythms. There is, perhaps, nothing more personal to a living being \n— as far as the observer is concerned— than its movements. In \nreality there is no such thing as movement in general; there are \nonly the movements of individual things.\nTechnique, however, considers the matter very differently. Gil- \nbreth’s ingenuity consisted in analyzing the notions of an indi­\nvidual and thus rendering them abstract. There was no longer a \nbeing in motion, but a point; not a series of acts, but a curve, a \ntrajectory in abstract space and time. It is true that human activi­\nties bear certain resemblances to one another, and by synthesizing \nthem it is possible to arrive at precise laws of their motion. More­\nover, every human skill in action is based upon a complex of funda­\nmental principles common to all. It is therefore possible to specify \nnot only the laws which govern them but also their exact trajec \ntories. This supposes, first, the abstraction of motion, and second, \nits analysis. Motion is dissected into discrete aspects so that its \nform appears phenomenally, point by point. The immediate conse­\nquence of such analysis is that motion becomes completely dis­\njoined from personal and internal life. Technical analysis concen­\ntrates on the efficient cause of human actions and eliminates as \nsecondary everything that expresses human personality. Action is \nno longer a real function of the person who performs it; it is a \nfunction of abstract and ideal symbols, which become its sole \ncriteria.\nAs long as we restrict ourselves to scientific investigation, such at-\nrespite of time indispensable to the rhythm of life; between desire and the satis­\nfaction of desire there is no longer the duration which is necessary for real choice \nand exam ination. There is no longer respite for reflecting or choosing or adapting \noneself, or for acting or wishing or pulling oneself together. The rule of life is: No \nsooner said than done. Life has become a racecourse com posed of instantaneous \nvariations of the universe, a succession of objective events which drag us along and \nlead us astray without anywhere affording us the possibility of standing apart, \ntaking stock, and ceasing to act\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 3 31\ntempts to analyze motion are completely acceptable. But as far as \nconcrete reality is concerned, they must be judged futile. However, \nthese analyses Soon showed their compelling power, and were ap­\nplied to an everincreasing degree to the modification of the worker’s \npractical motions. The problem of the regulation of these move­\nments in industry is so well known that I need not refer to it here. \nBut this type of regulation is gaining ground outside the sphere of \nmanual labor. All the machines of our technological society pre­\nsuppose to an ever greater degree the perfect motions Gilbreth \ndefined in his trajectories. The more rapidly our machines operate, \nthe more precise they must be, and the less we can allow ourselves \nthe luxury of using them arbitrarily. This is as true of the machines \nwe have in our houses as of the machines we meet on the street. \nOur movements must approach perfection to the degree that the \nmachines approach it and continue to increase in number. Our mo­\ntions are no longer entitled to express our own personalities. It \nsuffices to take one look at distracted and panicky elderly people \nin the middle of a Paris street to understand that modern velocities \nrender motion abstract and no longer tolerate imperfect motions \njust because they are human.\nWe still do not know the ultimate effects of these transforma­\ntions on the human being. We have only begun to study them. \nPrecisely what is modified in man by this violent upheaval of \nevery element of his environment? We do not know. But we do \nknow that violent modifications have taken place, and we have a \nforeboding of them in the development of neuroses and in the new \nbehaviors with which contemporary literature acquaints us. In \nceasing to be himself, modem man bears testimony to these phe­\nnomena not only when he suffers anxiety but even when he is \nhappy. For the last decade scientific studies have been accumulat­\ning which demonstrate man’s psychological, moral, and even bio­\nlogical incapacity to adapt in any real way to the milieu technique \nhas created for him. Careful studies have analyzed the nervous \nafflictions brought on by industrial work; but contact with other \nkinds of machines (for example, automobiles, television) or the \nlife of the technician in general apparently produce the same ef­\nfects. The November i960 issue of Semaines mSdicales de Vans, \non the basis of information contributed by 4,000 physicians all over \nthe world, offers a study of a new disease of great complexity which\n\f\n332 )  HUM AN TECHNIQUES\nis brought on by modem city life and which might be called urban-\nitis.\nSome investigators have already become engrossed in the ques­\ntion of a better adaptation of man to his new milieu. For example, \nthey are concerned with the necessity of giving man the means of \n“assimilating the machine,” or of assimilating its lessons, of causing \nit to become a part of human life. It is generally agreed that with­\nout such assimilation it is impossible to transcend the machine or \nto arrive at a new form of society. This assimilation is the prime \nobjective of the so-called human sciences, the sciences which have \nman as their subject.\nFurthermore, it is necessary to protect man by outfitting him \nwith a kind of psychological shock absorber. Only another tech­\nnique is able to give efficient protection against the aggression of \ntechniques. This protection is the second objective of the human\nsciences.\nWe shall examine later on whether it is reasonable to hope to \ncreate a genuinely human civilization by transcending the ma­\nchine with the aid of the human sciences. At this point let us \nremark merely that it is precisely the need to diagnose and cure \nthis disease that is offered as both justification and demand for the \ncreation of new human techniques.\nThe Creation of the Mass Society. There is a third area in which \nhuman techniques are applied, and it represents a further cause of \ndisequilibration for the human being seeking to adapt to his new \nmilieu.\nIt is a truism to state that contemporary society is becoming a \nmass society. The “process of massification,” “the accession of the \nmasses” have been thoroughly studied and understood. Less well \nunderstood, however, is the fact that the man of the present is not \nspontaneously adapted to the new form of society. Previous socie­\nties took their character to a very large degree from the men in \nthem. Technical or economic conditions imposed certain sociologi­\ncal structures, but the human being was in essential agreement with \nthese structures, and the form society took expressed the psy­\nchology of the individual. This is no longer true. The process of \nmassification takes place not because the man of today is by \nnature a mass man, but for technical reasons. Man becomes a mass \nman in the new framework imposed upon him because he is unable\n\f\nThe Technological Society (333\nto remain for very long at variance with his milieu. The adaptation \nof men to a mass society is not yet an accomplished fact; and recent \nresearch in the field of psychoanalytic sociology has revealed the \ngap which still exists between man and the collective society, a \ngap which is the cause of disequilibration. Every society has norms \nwhich represent a criterion of the normal. When these norms \nchange their character, a disturbance of equilibrium ensues and, \nfor the man who has not kept pace with the changes, neurosis. \nThere is no doubt that the norms of our civilization have changed \nfor reasons which are not “human”; men as a whole had no desire \nfor the changes that occurred nor did they work toward them con­\nsciously. Indirect influences have operated on the norms of modem \nsociety, and these norms have been transformed without men \nknowing what was happening.\nIt seems to me that Karen Homey’s analysis of this disequilibra­\ntion is accurate. According to Homey, our civilization (or so men \nbelieve) still attests to a secularized Christian ideology which sets \nthe highest value on brotherly relations. But the structures of our \nworld and its real norms represent diametrically the opposite. The \nfundamental rule of the world today is the rule of economic, \npolitical, and class competition— and this competition extends to \nthe social and human relations of friendship and sex. The dis­\nequilibration between the traditional affirmation and the new cri­\nterion has produced the climate of anxiety and insecurity charac­\nteristic of our epoch and of our neuroses, and corresponds exactly \nto the distinction between the individualist society and the mass \nsociety.\nThe human being does not feel at home in the collective at­\nmosphere. This is true of societies that differ in many ways among \nthemselves; it applies to the primitive sociological collectivism of \nAfrica, to the individualistic civilization of Europe, and to the col­\nlective adaptation of a higher type in the United States. In all these \nsocieties everyone is affected by a certain malaise. The change of \nsociological structures is occurring at a very rapid tempo and af­\nfects everyone; and the state demands an immediate collective \neffort from all the citizens. A sufficient respite is never afforded the \nindividual to allow him to assimilate all the new criteria.\nThe process of classification corresponds, moreover, to the dis­\nappearance of anything resembling a community. The majority of\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 3 4 )\nAmerican psychosociologists insist on the importance of human \nsocial relations for the individual. As Jerome Scott and R. P. \nLynton put it: “Every man requires emotional and intellectual \nsatisfactions which alone secure for him his belonging to a com­\nmunity.” When this need is suppressed, neuroses result Some ex­\nperts even maintain that most obsessive neurosis springs from a \nfailure of social adaptation and from the suppression of community \nrelations, for which technical relations are substituted, as Roeth- \nlisbergerhas pointed out.\nThis new sociological mass structure and its new criteria of \ncivilization seem both inevitable and undeniable. They are inevita­\nble because they are imposed by technical forces and economic \nconsiderations beyond the reach of man. They are not the result of \nthought, doctrine, discourse, will. They are simply there as a con­\ndition of fact All social reforms, all social changes, are located \nwholly within this condition of fact, unless they are purely utopian. \nWhen social change is truly realistic, it accepts this condition buoy­\nantly, vindicates it, and exploits it. Only two possibilities are left \nto tbe individual: either he remains what he was, in which case he \nbecomes more and more unadapted, neurotic, and inefficient, loses \nhis possibilities of subsistence, and is at last tossed on the social \nrubbish heap, whatever his talents may be; or he adapts himself to \nthe new sociological organism, which becomes his world, and he \nbecomes unable to live except in a mass society. (And then he \nscarcely differs from a cave man.) But to become a mass man en­\ntails a tremendous effort of psychic mutation. The purpose of the \ntechniques which have man as their object, the so-called human \ntechniques, is to assist him in this mutation, to help him find the \nquickest way. to calm his fears, and reshape his heart and his brain.\nWhen we look into technical rather than theoretical works on \nthis subject, the design emerges with great clarity. “It is a question \nof strengthening the environment in such a way that, in practice, \nall subjects come more or less quickly under its influence,” says \nClaude Munson, from a pragmatic American point of view. If inte­\ngration proves impossible, it is then necessary to uproot the indi­\nvidual from one social environment and place him in another where \nadaptation is possible. Somehow provision must be made for the \nindividual to reach the glorious state of equilibrium so desired by \nthose who guide human destiny— the state in which the individual\n\f\nThe Technological Society (335\nis so adapted that his personal difficulties are no different from \nthose of the collectivity. He is no longer a man in a group, but an \nelement of the group.\nIt is remarkable that mass participation distracts the individual \nfrom his miseries and even dispels them. After all, the process of \nmassification was itself the origin of man’s psychic difficulties!\nAnother aspect of this adaptation is the adjustment of the in­\ndividual to technical instruments. The instruments in our posses­\nsion are, in effect, mass instruments, both in the realm of material \naction and in that of psychological action. If at present we desire to \nexert any influence on man, it is possible to do so only through the \nmass media and only to the degree that man is a mass man. I shall \nreturn to this fact with reference to mass education and to propa­\nganda methods, both of which are able to move the mass individual \nonly by “massifying” him more and more.\nThe nonspontaneous union of the individual and the collectivity \nis one of the essential conditions for the development of techniques \nin the special sociological form they take in our society. This union \nis, as we shall see, one of the most noteworthy results of the tech­\nniques devoted to man. In this connection it is an oversimplifica­\ntion to speak of “collectivization’’ or \"human guidance.” This com­\nplete mutation of the human species has not been produced by a \ncollectivist theory or by someone’s will to power. The cause is \nmuch more profound, at once human and inhuman; inhuman be­\ncause it is occasioned by things and circumstances, human because \nit answers the heart’s desire of every modem man, without excep­\ntion.\nWe have studied the threefold foundation of the indispensable \nhuman techniques: the superhuman demands made on man by \npresent-day society, the complete modification of the human en­\nvironment, and the alteration of sociological structures. Man, in \nfundamental disaccord with his universe, must of necessity be \nrestored to harmony with it.\nHuman Techniques. It thus became imperative to rethink the \nwhole situation of man in his new world. But thinking things \nthrough seemed altogether insufficient; it was necessary to act Ac­\ntion upon the techniques themselves appeared to be impossible. \nThe question therefore became: Is it not possible to act upon man \nhimself? To help him resist? To protect him, perhaps; to educate\n\f\n3 3*>) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nhim, certainly? The applications of the human sciences were \nworked out along these lines of thought.\nIn our day human techniques offer great hopes to man, sorely \nbeset by anxiety. Not long ago an extensive survey of the different \nscientific disciplines appeared under the title: The Sciences of \nMan Re-establish His Supremacy. Man, menaced by his own dis­\ncoveries and no longer capable of mastering the forces unleashed \nby them, is to have his greatness restored by human techniques. \nThe grounds for hope given in the survey by Georges Fried­\nmann, Alain Sargent, Jean Fourastie, Georges Weill, Chombart de \nLowe, J. Gueron, and others are reducible to three elements:\nFirst, the liberation of man, not by technique in general, but spe­\ncifically through the agency of human techniques, a liberation \nwhich proceeds as much from within man as from without. With \nthe help of the human sciences, man will be freed from technocracy \nitself. Technique will combat slavery. According to Chombart de \nLowe, research in this area must be completely disinterested and \nfree from any preoccupation with immediate application. Tech­\nniques are in a position to offer man a saner and more balanced \nlife and to free him from material constraints, whether these arise \nfrom nature or from the actions of other men. The human being \nis freer when he is no longer in danger of famine and when he has \nsome leisure from labor. Technique is in great part the basis of \nthis freedom. In addition, the human techniques purify and free \nthe inner man; this, for example, is the grand design of psycho­\nanalysis. Man, freed and returned to himself, will be much better \nadapted to life and to the mastery of the difficulties with which the \nmodem world confronts him.\nThe second element is less hackneyed: the world of techniques \nis no longer the abstract and mechanical world imagined by its \ncritics and by the technocrats themselves. We have known for some \ntime that technique is of little value if it has not been rendered \ntractable by man. Humanism, then, has been restored to its place \nof honor; to act contrary to the profundities of human nature is to \nact irrationally. This represents, for the most part, a merely verbal \nand ideological humanism. There may have been some genuinely \nhumanistic aspects in modem discoveries, but for the most part \nthey have been primarily technical. A good method applied by an \nimbecile does not yield good results; and a technique used by a\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 3 7\nman full of rancor, disgust, or resentment, or by a man who detests \nit, will not be very efficient. Research therefore has taken two di­\nrections. It has concerned itself with making the interests of man \nand technique correspond, thus rendering technique flexible. It \nhas also attempted to take human nature into account in order to \nkeep man from being crushed by technique, thereby becoming an \nobstacle to technique. On both these counts there has been an un­\nceasing effort to refine our knowledge of human techniques in order \nto bridge the gap between man and technique. The claims of the \nhuman being have thus come to assert themselves to a greater and \ngreater degree in the development of techniques; this is known as \n“humanizing the techniques.” Man is not supposed to be merely a \ntechnical object, but a participant in a complicated movement. \nHis fatigue, pleasures, nerves, and opinions are carefully taken into \naccount Attention is paid to his reactions to orders, his phobias, \nand his earnings. A ll this fills the uneasy With hope. From the mo­\nment man is taken seriously, it seems to them that they are wit­\nnessing the creation of a technical humanism.\nThe third element of hope is the fact that these human tech­\nniques have tended to reconstitute the unity of the human being \nwhich had been shattered by the sudden and jarring action of \ntechnique. The grand design of human techniques is to make man \nthe center of all techniques. He has been torn in every direction \nby the technical forces of the modem world and is no longer able \nof himself, at least on an individual level, to preserve his unity. \nBut this lost unity can be restored by technique on the abstract \nlevel of science. There is no doubt that technique can counter tech­\nnique; and abstractly man can thereby be restored to unity. A \ngroup of techniques is to be formed, therefore, centered on a con­\ncept of man and activated by the human techniques.\nThere is a fourth glorious element: the prospect of the creation \nof a “superman.” He will not appear tomorrow. But serious biolo­\ngists already speak of the possibilities of chemical conditioning in \nthe near future, and, more distantly, of parthenogenesis and ecto- \ngenesis, and embryonic conditioning. It is useless to dwell on these \ntheories here; they are only remote possibilities. However, it is \ninstructive to see how many intellectuals hope to find in the crea­\ntion of superman the solution of all the otherwise insoluble prob­\nlems posed to the common man by the technical world in which\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 3 8)\nhe lives. Of course the superman I speak of has nothing to do with \nSuperman, the American comic-strip character. Man’s power is not \nthe issue here, but his intellectual and psychic life, to say nothing \nof his spiritual life.\nIt would be idle to deny all reality to such hopes. To a great \ndegree these auguries are justified. Technical knowledge does give \nus new insights into human reality and can serve toward its unifi­\ncation.\nAmong the elements I have summarized, the most important is \nundoubtedly the second. The concrete details of man’s life with \nrespect to technical apparatus must be taken into consideration on \nthe human plane. The fatigue factor is important; and the indi­\nvidual’s labor must be planned to reduce fatigue. It is essential in \nconstructing machinery to avoid uncomfortable or dangerous situa­\ntions for the operator, and to modify the wage earner’s milieu to \ngive him more pleasure, light, and the freedom and fellow feeling \nindispensable to him. It is desirable to show concern for the \nworker’s dwelling place, for the comfort of the housewife’s kitchen, \nfor the lighting of the children’s rooms; in short, for any factor \nthat will obviously be of advantage to all. Who could believe the \ncontrary or plead for slums or worker casualties?\nHowever, a certain misunderstanding must be avoided. The \nword humanism is often spoken in connection with the situation I \nhave described. Humanism is essentially a certain conception of \nman. And, it develops, this is an astonishing conception of man, a \nconception that involves contempt for man’s inner life to the ad­\nvantage of his sociological life, contempt of his moral and intel­\nlectual life to the advantage of his material life. This position is \nadmissible for conscious materialists; but I cannot admit it for the \nunconscious materialists who are always prating of their spiritu­\nality. The argument that moral development will follow material \ndevelopment can only be characterized as hypocrisy. Moreover, \nit has not always been a voluntary and conscious humanism which \nhas presided over this progress. If we seek the real reason, we hear \nover and over again that there is \"something out of line” in the \ntechnical system, an insupportable state of affairs for a technician. \nA remedy must be found. What is out of line? According to the \nusual superficial analysis, it is man that is amiss. The technician"

He has a \nmethod which has hitherto enabled him to solve all difficulties, and \nhe uses it here too. But he considers man only as an object of \ntechnique and only to the degree that man interferes with the \nproper function of the technique. Technique reveals its essential \nefficiency in discerning that man has a sentimental and moral life \nwhich can have great influence on his material behavior and in pro­\nposing to do something about such factors on the basis of its own \nends. These factors are, for technique, human and subjective; but \nif means can be found to act upon them, to rationalize them and \nbring them into line, they need not be a technical drawback. Of \ncourse, man as such does not count.\nWhen the technical problem is well in hand, the professional \nhumanists look at the situation and dub it “humanist.” This pro­\ncedure suits the literati, moralists, and philosophers who are con­\ncerned about the human situation. What is more natural than for \nphilosophers to say: \"See how we are concerned with Man?”; and \nfor their literary admirers to echo: “At last, a humanism which is \nnot confined to playing with ideas but which penetrates the facts!” \nUnfortunately, it is a historical fact that this shouting of humanism \nalways comes after the technicians have intervened; for a true \nhumanism, it ought to have occurred before. This is nothing more \nthan the traditional psychological maneuver called rationalizing.\nSince 1947 we have witnessed the same humanist rationalizing \nwith respect to the earth itself. In the United States, for example, \nmethods of large-scale agriculture had been savagely applied. The \nhumanists became alarmed by this violation of the sacred soil, \nthis lack of respect for nature; but the technical people troubled \nthemselves not at all until a steady decline in agricultural pro­\nductivity became apparent Technical research discovered that the \nearth contains certain trace elements which become exhausted \nwhen the soil is mistreated. This discovery, made by Sir Albert \nHoward in his thorough investigation of Indian agriculture, led to \nthe conclusion that animal and vegetable (“organic” ) fertilizers \nwere superior to any and all artificial fertilizers, and that it is es­\nsential not to exhaust the earth's reserves. Up to now no one has \nsucceeded in finding a way of replacing trace elements artificially. \nThe technicians have recommended more care in the use of fer­\ntilizers and moderation in die utilization of machinery; in short.\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES340)\n“respect” for the soil. And all nature lovers rejoice. But was any \nreal respect for the earth involved here? Clearly not. The impor­\ntant thing was agricultural yield.\nIt might be objected: “Who cares what the real causes were if \nthe result is respect for man or for nature? If technical excess \nbrings us to wisdom, let us by all means develop techniques. If \nman must be effectively protected by a technique that understands \nhim, we may at least rest assured that he will be better protected \nthan he ever was by all his philosophies.” This is hocus-pocus. To­\nday’s technique may respect man because it is in its interest and \npart of its normal course of development to do so. But we have \nno certainty that this will be so in the future. We could have a \nmeasure of certainty only if technique, by necessity and for deep \nand lasting reasons, subordinated its power in principle to the in­\nterests of man Otherwise, a complete reversal is always possible. \nTomorrow it might be in technique’s interest to exploit man bru­\ntally, to mutilate and suppress him. We have, as of now, no guaran­\ntee whatsoever that this is not the road it will take. On the contrary, \nwe see all around us at least as many signs of increasing contempt \nfor man as of respect for him. Technique mixes the one with the \nother indiscriminately. The only law it follows is that of its own \nautonomous development. To me, therefore, it seems impossible \nto speak of a technical humanism.\nReview\nBight at the beginning, let us emphasize that we are studying \ntechnique.\nIt was thought for a long time that man’s conduct belonged to \nthe realm of art, and it can certainly be said that Freudian psy­\nchoanalysis is an art. Behavior based on flair, on intuitive as well \nas reasoned knowledge, and on personal relations; the spontaneous \ndevising of means for influencing heart and mind; the whole­\nhearted participation of man in his acts— all these are characteristic \nof art. Great leaders, great teachers, and agitators have all been \nartists. But art and artistry no longer suffice. We must find solu­\ntions to the problems raised by techniques, and only through \ntechnical means can we find them.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (341\nThe means of exerting action on men must answer to the fol­\nlowing three criteria: (1) Generality. Every man must be reached \nin every area of life because everyone is involved. Individual ac­\ntion is unimportant, (a) Objectivity. Action, since it is a function \nof society itself, cannot be dependent upon the transient and sub­\njective acts of individuals. The means must be rendered independ­\nent of the individual who employs them so as to make them ap­\nplicable by anyone at all. This criterion alone would imply the \ntransition from art to technique. (3) Permanence. Since the techni­\ncal challenge to man concerns his whole life, psychic action must \nbe exerted upon him without letup, from the beginning of his \nexistence to its end.\nLocalized intervention by the great or powerful can no longer be \nrelied upon. And action by fits and starts is not enough; it must be \nsteady and uniform. Because the transition to practical application \nmust be effected quickly, it is scarcely possible to speak of science. \nThe problem is to discover the most effective means; one is there­\nfore obliged to call the whole complex technique, in spite of the \nlofty tone taken by people who put their faith in the “human \nsciences.” When Serge Tchakhotin writes, with reference to prop­\naganda, that “the understanding of the mechanisms of human \nbehavior entails the possibility of managing them at will” . . . and \nthat “calculation, prediction, and action according to verifiable \nlaws are possible,” he is describing human techniques accurately.\nThree facts demonstrate the reality of the transition of action \nfrom art to technique. The first is the state of mind common to the \ntechnicians who make use of human techniques. They arbitrarily \nselect only those scientific data which seem useful and are disdain­\nfully condescending toward whatever data are not utilizable. In \npsychology and psychoanalysis, for example, vocational counselors \ndnd propagandists make a definite choice. In the field of practical \npsychology known as \"public relations” (as practiced by, say, Dale \nCarnegie or Claude Munson), a certain suspicion of theoretical and \nabstract psychology prevails; and certain indispensable simplifica­\ntions are made. Munson writes that “the mechanism of morale \nbuilding is neither simpler nor less technical than a problem in \nmechanics. Both require a clear conception of the objective, the \nelaboration of a plan of methodical execution, the knowledge of \nall the co-operating factors, a central agent entrusted with the direc-"

He writes: “Without being able to point out in advance \nthe solution for a particular case, one at least knows that the solu­\ntion will fit into a determinate type to which certain general prin­\nciples are applicable.” Munson has in mind a program of all the \ndifferent forms of deliberate persuasion, a program with technical \nprecision and flexibility.\nA second characteristic of the transition from art to technique is \nthe extensive application of mathematics. Biometry, psychometry, \nsociometry, and cybernetics have become the chief intermediaries \nfor creating these techniques. It is considered illusory to think it \npossible to construct a true system of action from nonquantitative \nlaws and observations. This was the traditional stumbling block for \npsychological techniques. When the attempt was first made to \ncreate a true technique of propaganda, for example, biology, an \nexact science, was taken as the basis. Subsequently, other exact \ndisciplines were called upon; for example, public opinion polls and \nstatistics. Progress in this and other human techniques came about \nonly when the human sciences took on the exactitude of mathe­\nmatics. Only metric methods can analyze and predict efficiently. \nIt is striking to note, incidentally, that metric methods applied in \ndifferent kinds of political regimes by different kinds of technicians \ncome to the same result. This too is characteristic of techniques. \nIn this respect, I find a remark made by Paul H. Maucorps very \nmuch to the point. Speaking of American sociometry, Maucorps \nsays: “It is interesting to observe that this sociometry has the same \npractical conclusions as the so-called Stakhanovism.” Rubinstein \nmakes the same observation from the Soviet point of view.\nThe third characteristic element in the transition from art to \ntechnique is the appearance of the technical-experimental state of \nmind. It is admittedly difficult to test human techniques experi­\nmentally. This is so for two reasons. These techniques cannot be \nmanipulated freely by the experimenter. Moreover, human society \nforms a complicated whole, so that it is very difficult to achieve \nthe two conditions necessary for technical experimentation, isola­\ntion of phenomena and analysis of elements.\nHowever, without having recourse to the dangerous and over-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (343\nhasty methods of totalitarian states, experimenters in the field of \nhuman techniques have found a particularly good experimental \nfield: the army. The army is a singularly favorable environment be­\ncause the soldier is away from his customary framework. His social \nties have been severed, and he has been divested of his traditional \npersonality. He then forms completely new social ties; the resultant \ncollectivity can be studied from its inception, and isolated from \nsecondary and complicating influences. Such a collectivity, more­\nover, lends itself to study and is easily observed from day to day. \nThe personality of each man is completely new, for with the new \nuniform he assumes a new psychology.\nThe experiments on the army serve a twofold purpose. First, the \nrecruits are directly influenced in their actions and carry this in­\nfluence back into civilian life, where their behavior will be predict­\nable and they themselves will be easily manipulated. The civilian \npopulation, therefore, can be influenced through the intermediacy \nof the army, which is connected with the rest of society by links \nthat are being drawn tighter and tighter. Second, the knowledge \ngained through experimentation on soldiers has indirect import­\nance. This knowledge can be applied to other, more complex mi­\nlieus which might not lend themselves readily to experimentation, \neven though they are similar to the army in kind. Examples which \ncome to mind are business organizations and, particularly, great \nindustrial plants. Methods found effective in the army are applied \nto the plant; and in the process there is an inevitable tendency to \nsimplify human relations and to model after the military the indus­\ntrial collectives in which these techniques are applied. This in­\ndirect action is only slowly being felt; but the massive displacement \nof workers, which is constantly increasing even in liberal coun­\ntries, shows that, involuntarily, technique in the form of human \ntechniques is gradually gaining the upper hand.\nHuman techniques are of such multiplicity that any attempt to \ndescribe them adequately would require a whole library. Even an \nattempt to enumerate them would entail the loss of a cohesiveness \nand compactness. There are techniques addressed to man as an \nisolated individual and techniques addressed to man as a social \nbeing. Some concern his mind and some his body; others touch his \nwill; still others that secret place where matter becomes spirit and \nsoul animates matter. Techniques are addressed to the child and\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 4 4 )\nto the man, to the fetus and to the commissioner. They should be \nordered into a system, as in fact they are. In such a system the same \ntechnique would be represented on different levels corresponding \nto different ends. For example, psychoanalytic technique enters \ninto the mechanisms of propaganda, the modem school, and voca­\ntional guidance. Here, however, I shall try only to describe as \nsoberly and briefly as possible the basic themes, subjects, and prin­\nciples of the problem. It would be useless to describe them at \nlength or in great detail. A condensed description will bring the \nfacts into sharp relief, and that must suffice.\nEducational Technique. All of us who were adult in 1950 in \nFrance preserved a vivid memory of dismal schools where teachers \nwere enemies and punishment was a constant menace; of narrow, \nbarred windows, gloomy brown walls, and uncomfortable benches \nhollowed out by generations of bored students. The smell of sour \nmilk, dirty smocks and snot-nosed kids made a unique impression \nthat a young instructor would never forget. We well remcml>er \nbooks without illustrations, incomprehensible lessons learned by \nrote, discipline, and boredom. We had a healthy fear of the mas­\nters, upon whom we played our tricks. We feared some of our fel­\nlow pupils too, especially those who sat behind us, against whom \nwe were unarmed. The students were divided into the weak and the \nStrong, much like an embryonic political structure where the weak \nquickly band together. There was pitiless competition in respect \nto studies, marks, and places. Categories were simple then: work \nwas a curse, the school Wii d iiuaii.It; world, and the greater society \noutside its walls seemed to be the same. All superiors were ene­\nmies. There were the snivelers who wanted only to get by, and \nthe tough characters strong enough to dispense with the kind of \nsuccess school life offered. All the rest were either cowed or re­\nbellious, according to their natures. These were the ancient and \nfamiliar categories of school life which were suddenly overthrown \nby the extension of a series of techniques that we call techniques \nde tecole nouvelle— progressive education.\nProgressive education has as its end the “happiness\" of the child. \nIt entails bright classrooms, understanding teachers, and pleasur­\nable work. Its educational formulas are well-known: the child in \nschool must be “relaxed\" and enjoy himself; he must exist in a \n“balanced environment,” get rid of his “complexes,” and “play\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 3 4 5\nwhile he is learning.” All this represents a perfectly valid program. \nIt has the elements of genial scholarship derived from the cele­\nbrated saying of Montaigne to the effect that we must stop cram­\nming children’s skulls to pass the baccalaureate; supercharging \ntheir brains with encyclopedic knowledge to the detriment of all \nother activities. Education must seek, rather, to develop in a bal­\nanced way all their faculties, physical, manual, psychic, and intel­\nlectual, and in this last, it must seek to stress personal observation \nand reasoning instead of rote learning. Moreover, the whole process \nis supposed to take place with the minimum possible use of force. \nIt is essential to respect the person of the child and to individualize \ninstruction to the maximum. Instruction is part of total education \nand is not addressed to the intelligence alone. Its method, based on \nthe maieutic *  of Socrates, consists in bringing the child himself \nto discover the properties of objects or, starting from facts he him­\nself observes, the principles which underlie them. This educational \nprocedure is, however, a highly refined technique, detailed and \nrigorous; and it makes the most exacting demands on the tech­\nnician himself, who must indeed be a remarkable pedagogue to \nbe able to apply it It is not a mechanical technique that applies \nitself almost ipso facto. The same holds for the majority of the \nhuman techniques we shall discuss. The person of the technician \ncounts for a very great deal, especially since these techniques are in \ntheir infancy.\nClearly, the child so educated will be much better balanced and \nin a better position to develop his own personality. It is beside the \npoint to note how inadequately this program has been applied in \nFrance and how meager have been its results. It has been a prob­\nlem, for example, to recruit enough qualified teachers to make it \npossible to assign students to classes of no more than fifteen. Diffi­\nculties have been experienced in adapting the new methods to the \nold-time examination programs, which remain unchanged; this of \ncourse vitiates the system and results in overburdening the child. \nThere are difficulties with regard to school location and equipment. \nBut these stumbling blocks seem to me only of secondary impor­\ntance. They represent transitional problems of adaptation which,\n* Maieutic (from the Greek word for “ m idwife\"): a term applied by Socrates to his \nmethod of teaching which was designed to bring to clear consciousness what was \nalready present but hidden in the recesses of the mind. (Trans.)\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES34 « )\nin the normal course of events, will disappear. In a “normalized” \nsociety the new school is the only possible system; and when the \nimportance of the education it has to offer has been understood, \nno sacrifice will be spared to secure the application of its method. \nRecall the sacrifices of the Hitler regime and of the Communists in \nbehalf of education. The new education is a governing principle of \nevery modern political system and of technique as a whole.\nWe come here to one of the most important problems raised by \nthe new method: the child’s personality development. The problem \nis to put the child in the best possible situation and to prepare him \noptimally for the tasks that await him. These are phrases that are \nheard everywhere, as for example in the following statement drawn \nfrom a speech of Mme Montessori to UNESCO:\nWe must awaken the child’s social conscience. I know that it is a \ncomplicated educational question, but the child who will become \nthe man must be able to understand life and its needs, the funda­\nmental reason for all existence, the search for happiness . . . He \nmust know exactly what he must do and what he must not do for \nthe good of humanity . . .  To reach these ends, we must prepare \nthe child to understand the meaning and necessity of the entente \namong the nations. The organization of the peace devolves more \non education than on politics. To secure peace practically, we must \nenvision a humane education, psychopedagogy, which affects not \none nation but all men on earth . . . Education must become a \ntruly humane science to guide all men to judge the present situ­\nation correctly.\nThis statement seems to me truly remarkable in that it designates \ncandidly the end of psychopedagogic technique in the best pos­\nsible circumstances, within a liberal and democratic conception of \nman, state, and society. ( Mme Montessori is a liberal and speaks \nfor liberal countries.) I have taken Mme Montessorfs statement by \nway of example; but one could examine the purpose of this tech­\nnique in numerous other pedagogical studies published in the past \nfew years.\nWe note first of all that this technique must be implemented by \nthe state, which alone has the means and the breadth to carry it \nthrough. But the rigorous application of the psychopedagogic tech­\nnique means the end of private instruction— and therefore of a \ntraditional freedom.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (347\nSecond, this technique is “pantocrator.”4  It must be exercised \nover all men. If one man is left who is not trained according to its \nmethods, there is the danger of his becoming a new Hitler. The \ntechnique cannot be effected unless all children are obliged to par­\nticipate and all parents to co-operate. There can be no exceptions. \nIf only a minority are educated to comply, this technique can re­\nsolve none of the problems it is intended to meet. Mme Montes- \nsori's statement is therefore neither a metaphor nor an exaggera­\ntion; all human beings, without exception, must be reached. We \nnote again the aggressive character of technique. Mme Montessori \nemphasizes the fact that “it is necessary to free the child from the \nslavery of school and family” for him to enter the cycle of freedom \nproper to this technique. However, this freedom consists in a \nprofound and detailed surveillance of the child’s activities, a com­\nplete shaping of his spiritual life, and a precise regulation of his \ntime with a stop watch; in short, in habituating him to a joyful \nserfdom. The most important aspect of this technique is the forced \n(mentation toward it. It is a social force directed toward a social \nend.\nThe education of the child, however, is not directed toward some \nmerely abstract social end. Concretely, the child must develop a \nsocial conscience, understand that the meaning of life is the good \nof humanity, and grasp the need for an entente among all nations. \nThese ideas are much less vague than one might think. The good \nof humanity, for example, is not the obscure notion the philoso­\nphers pretend it to be. At most, it varies somewhat with the \npolitical regime; and even this variability is becoming less and less \npronounced. Compare Life magazine with the Soviet News and \nyou will see that the “good of humanity” is conceived in almost \nidentical terms in the United States and in the Soviet Union; the \ndifference lies mainly in the persons charged with securing it  In \nboth cases, the social good can be reduced to a few concrete and \nprecise factors. The corresponding educational technique, as a \nconsequence, takes a completely determinate direction. Social con­\nformism must be impressed upon the child: he must be adapted to \nhis society; he must not impair its development. His integration \ninto the body social must be assured with the least possible friction.\n*Pantocrator— a Creek word signifying “ omnipotent.'' It was an epithet applied to \nYahweh, Lord of Hosts, and to the Byzantine emperors. (Trans.)\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES348)\nThis technique of alleged liberation of the child cannot be ori­\nented differently, even if it were so desired. The technique permits \nthe broadening of the child, the development of his social per­\nsonality and happiness, and consequently, of his equilibrium. Op­\nposition to society, the lack of social adaptation, produces serious \npersonality difficulties which lead to the loss of psychic equilib­\nrium. One of the most important factors in the child’s education \ntherefore is social adaptation. This means that— despite all the \npretentious talk about the aims of education— it is not the child \nin and for himself who is being educated, but the child in and for \nsociety. And the society, moreover, is not an ideal one, with full \njustice and truth, but society as it is.\nWhen a society becomes increasingly totalitarian (and I say \n“society,” not “state” ), it creates more and more difficulties of \nadaptation and requires its citizens to be conformist in the same \ndegree. Thus, this technique becomes all the more necessary. I \nhave no doubt that it makes men better balanced and “happier.” \nAnd there is the danger. It makes men happy in a milieu which \nnormally would have made them unhappy, if they had not been \nworked on, molded, and formed for just that milieu. What looks \nlike the apex of humanism is in fact the pinnacle of human sub­\nmission: children are educated to become precisely what society \nexpects of them. They must have social consciences that allow \nthem to strive for the same ends as society sets for itself. Clearly, \nwhen modem youth are fully educated in the new psycliupedagogic \ntechnique, many social and political difficulties will disappear. Any \nform of government or social transformation becomes possible with \nindividuals who have experienced this never-ending process of \nadaptation. The key word of the new human techniques is, there­\nfore, adaptation, and we shall come upon it repeatedly as we con­\nsider each of these techniques separately.\nThe new pedagogical methods correspond exactly to the role \nassigned to education in modem technical society. The Napoleonic \nconception that the Lycees must furnish administrators for the \nstate and managers for the economy, in conformity with social \nneeds and tendencies, has become world-wide in its extent. Ac­\ncording to this conception, education no longer has a humanist end \nor any value in itself; it has only one goal, to create technicians. A\n\f\nThe Technological Society (.349\nsurvey conducted by the newspaper Combat In 1950 appeared \nunder the headline: Higher Education Has Ho Relation to Indus­\ntrial Needs. A survey conducted by Le Monde in 1952 began with \nthe words: “There are too many half-baked intellectuals and not \nenough technicians.” It would be useless to multiply such refer­\nences. They are literally infinite in number since they express every­\nbody’s feelings in the matter. Instruction must be useful in life. \nToday’s life is technique. It follows, then, that instruction must \nabove all else be technical. This is all very well for the individual \npreoccupied with finding a trade or a profession; but we find the \nsame tendency when we look at society as a whole. Technique has \nagain effected the reconciliation of individual and society.\nEducation, even in France, is becoming oriented toward the spe­\ncialized end of producing technicians; and, as a consequence, to­\nward the creation of individuals useful only as members of a tech­\nnical group, on the basis of the current criteria of utility— individ­\nuals who conform to the structure and the needs of the technical \ngroup. The intelligentsia will no longer be a model, a conscience, \nor an animating intellectual spirit for the group, even in the sense \nof performing a critical function. They will be the servants, the \nmost conformist imaginable, of the instruments of technique. As \nLouis Couffignal puts it, the human brain must be made to conform \nto the much more advanced brain of the machine. And education \nwill no longer be an unpredictable and exciting adventure in \nhuman enlightenment, but an exercise in conformity and an ap­\nprenticeship to whatever gadgetry is useful in a technical world. \nThe Technique of Work. The day is still a long way off when we \nwill have at our disposal men educated in accordance with the \nnew methods. It will be another half century at the earliest before \nthey mature; time is needed for organizing them. In France we \nmust count on two decades for generalizing them and breaking \nthem in and on another two decades for the results to become \nevident in the whole generation so educated. The tempo of change \nwill perhaps be more rapid in the United States and in the Soviet \nUnion and less rapid in the rest of Europe.\nIn the meantime, society must continue to function. During the \ninterim period, another powerful system of adaptation will be put \ninto effect: the complex of work techniques. This technical complex\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES350)\nincludes vocational guidance, the organization of labor, the physi­\nology of work, and so on. Here again we find the assertion that \nprogress is in the direction of a certain “humanism.”\nWork techniques began with the world of the machine and dis­\nplayed scant regard for human beings. Machines were invented \nand assembled, buildings were put up around them, and men were \nput inside. For fifty years the procedure was completely haphazard. \nThen it was noted that the worker’s productivity could be markedly \nincreased by imposing certain rules on him. The result was the sys­\ntem associated with the names of the Americans Frederick Winslow \nTaylor and Henry Ford. As Georges Friedmann has shown, they \ntook nothing into consideration beyond the necessities of produc­\ntion and the maximum utilization of the machine; they completely \nignored the serfdom these factors entail— with their production \nlines, their infinite subdivision of tasks, and so on.\nThe objection will be raised, and rightly so, that this system was \ngradually changed and eventually became concerned not so much \nwith questions of maximal exploitation as with optimal results. \nWorker fatigue (a topic we still don’t know enough about) became \nthe subject of intense investigations. The importance of the human \nfactor was recognized. And it even began to be recognized that \nthis was insufficient, that man was still only one “factor” among \nmany, and not the most important. It became necessary to recog­\nnize the primacy of the whole human being, to adapt the work to \nthe man, and to take the worker’s psychological equilibrium into \nconsideration. It goes without saying that the motive force behind \nall this was the recognition that human psychology reacts directly \nupon productivity. When the worker feels that he is in a hostile \nenvironment and in an economic system opposed to his interests, \nhe will not work (and this is involuntary) with the same ardor \nand skill. All this, according to Friedmann, posed the problem of \nthe economic regime as a whole. Economic improvement is not of \nitself a strong enough tendency to allow the worker as producer \nto benefit from technical progress, although he may have benefited \ngreatly from it as consumer. Purely material transformations in \nthe conditions of labor are insufficient. They are doubtless neces­\nsary to begin with, but physiological adaptation is not the only \nkind. Hygiene and safety must indeed be improved; the best loca­\ntion must be selected, and even music may have to be exploited"

It may take the form \nof a manufacturing structure like that of Bata,5  or it may consist of \nsocial, sports, or educational arrangements. Integration may mean \nworker participation in finance or management or, in an extreme \ncase, the application of a thorough system such as \"public rela­\ntions” or \"human engineering.” It suffices here to point out some \nof the many techniques of integration without going into their \nquite varied mechanisms.\nSome excellent results have been achieved along this line. For \nexample, the tendency to adapt the machine to man and to assert \nman’s primacy over the machine has produced a body of respect­\nable research. Until recently, very few designers and manufacturers \nof machine tools bothered much about the workers who were to use \nthe tools. It represents enormous progress for them to acknowledge \nthat machines should be built with the workers in mind, that \nthe human being ought to be the point of departure. However, \nthe further they advance in this direction, the more complicated the \nproblem appears. They were at first concerned primarily with the \nelimination of physical fatigue; having succeeded in this, they \nfind that nervous or mental fatigue is now a problem. Business \nmachines are highly adapted to the worker from a material point \nof view; physical effort has been almost completely reduced by the \nprogressive elimination of fatigue due to standing, sensory Over­\nburdening, and the need for overtime work. But the reduction of \nphysical effort has only served to increase fatigue due to mental \nconcentration, reflex attention, and dissymmetry of motion, factors \nwhich rapidly produce nervous exhaustion. It was certainly not\n* Thomas Bata (1876-1932) was a Czech industrialist who made his shoe factories \nat Zlin into a federation of independent \"studios.”  (Trans.)\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES35^)\nanticipated that machines designed (or man, and well adapted to \nhim physically, would occasion even more rapid deterioration and \nan accelerated aging of their operators. Indeed, worker produc­\ntivity markedly decreases after only four years, and, in general, \nbecomes marked at age twenty-two. The optimum age of an em­\nployee who operates business machines would seem to lie between \nsixteen and twenty-two. Now, this last fact comes from the machine \nin itself, from its tempo, and so on. The human problem has been \nintensified, rather than resolved. It even seems insoluble. The con­\ncern for the human being that is evident in these attempts must, \none supposes, be reckoned progress; the same holds for the tech­\nnician’s concern with the person of the worker, and the attempts to \nfurnish him with means for self-improvement by establishing li­\nbraries or by helping him resolve his personal problems.\nBut on further consideration, are not these efforts and this in­\nterest part of an abstract ideal? What do they really signify? Leon \nWalther, the great theoretician of the adaptation of machine to \nman, states that this adaptation has as its end “the maximum \nproductivity with the minimum expenditure of human energy.” \nBut such a goal represents a primacy of efficiency, with reference \nboth to man and machine. The greater concern is to make men \nwork effectively; and, marvelous dispensation, advantages for pro­\nduction turn out to coincide with advantages for the individual.\nOne of the principal creators of libraries for workers has de­\nscribed the concept of “practical utility” which ought to govern \nsuch libraries. Books are to be selected on the basis of “their even­\ntual moral yield.” If a book enables the worker to escape the direct \ncontrol of the bosses, “it ought to be authorized only to the degree \nthat the subject treated allows the management to exercise control \nindirectly.” With this proviso, a book can be an invaluable auxil­\niary, since it introduces personal interest, serves as a source of \ninitiative, and satisfies curiosity; but on the condition that the \nworker is ignorant of what he ought to know and that management \nhas the “duty” to choose for him.\nIt might, incidentally, be asked: “Are these ideas capitalist or \nCommunist?” Anyone who could give an unambiguous answer to \nthis question would indeed be an expert, for the same conceptions \noccur as frequently in one system as in the other. They do not \nrepresent theories, but are the direct expression of the fact that\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 S3\nwork technique necessitates the complete integration o£ the worker. \nIt is inadmissible that the worker's reading matter should occasion \nslowdowns, rebellion, or displacement of the center of interest \nSuch things are unthinkable, whatever the regime. Culture must \nconform to technique and encouraige productivity. Censorship in \nthis area ought therefore not to be regarded as an evil, but as an \nunavoidable condition of objective technique. The same holds for \nthe surprising creation of the post of “counselors,” of which Fried­\nmann has written. After it had been observed in certain industrial \nplants that the conditions of modem labor provoke psychological \ndifficulties, psychologists were hired to act as “safety valves” for \nemployee grievances and dissatisfactions. Employees may express \ntheir feelings to these “counselors” with the assurance that the \ncounselors will say nothing to management. But the counselors \nnever actually counsel anything. Their activities have nothing what­\never to do with a positive cure of the soul, a mission which would \nsuppose at least the possibility of profound changes, new orienta­\ntions, and an awakening consciousness on the worker's part, all of \nwhich are highly dangerous. Nor are the counselors concerned with \ninvestigations of concrete modifications that might be binding on \nthe company. Their sole duty is to encourage the voicing of com­\nplaints and to listen to them. It is well-known that suffering ex­\npressed is suffering relieved. It has been observed that certain \npsychological disturbances are provoked simply by being silent \nand that rebellions are nourished in secret. To let people talk does \nthem good and quashes revolt It is dangerous to allow the workers \nto talk over their problems among themselves. It is far more \nprudent to give them a safety valve in the form of a discreet com­\npany agent, a psychological technician, than to let them air their \ngrievances in public. These “counselors\" play the same role on the \nindustrial level as the Soviet magazine KrokodU does on the politi­\ncal. It is difficult to find a human interest in any of this. The \nconcern here is primarily with technical development. The pallia­\ntion of the human difficulties raised by technique is secondary. \nMichel Crozier asserts that this is true also for the technique called \n“human engineering.”\nThis situation exists also in other disciplines (for example, in \nsociology), which forces us to conclusions that seem in no sense \nsubjective. Social research establishes the primacy of the socio-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES354}\nlogical over the human: it is not concerned only with man’s indi­\nvidual psychology and physiology, but also with his relation to the \nbody social. Here the important problem is to make him really \nbelong to the social group. The problem is the same for a socialized \nas for a capitalist economy. A solution may perhaps be more \nfeasible for a capitalist society, but both are faced with the problem \nof convincing man and gaining his allegiance. This gives rise to yet \nanother human technique, which I shall refer to later on. At this \npoint let us consider its aims.\nIn Aspects sociaux de la rationalisation, the 1931 report of the In­\nternational Labor Organization, we read that \"it is necessary to \nrationalize not only manufacturing, but also employer-employee \nrelations.” And in 1941 the ILO asserted that “only when industrial \ntechnique succeeds in developing concern for the human being will \nAmerican capitalism win the confidence of its workers, customers, \nand bond holders, of the public individually and collectively.’' As \nFriedmann puts it, the purpose of the scientific organization of \nlabor, before and after the advent of psychotechnique, industrial \nrelations, and technical humanism, was and is to “assure maximal \nyield with minimal loss of effort or material. But these latter repre­\nsent means which are becoming complicated and refined to the \npoint of transforming little by little the face of the scientific or­\nganization of labor.” The system of human relations which is being \nre-created in the industrial framework is constructed, according to \nits originators, on the basis of an industrial model. In this respect \nthe study of W. E. Moore is significant. According to Moore, human \nrelations must correspond to the functions of individuals engaged \nin the production cycle. Moore assigns the following four char­\nacteristics to human relations:\nFirst, human relations must be restricted to the technical de­\nmands of their vocational role. They must not become deep rela­\ntions involving profound ideas, tendencies, and preoccupations. \nIndividuals who are part of the industrial tempo must remain hu­\nman and sustain mutual human relationships, but only those that \nrelate to technical activity.\nSecond, human relations must be universal; they must be \"based \non criteria which the members of an arbitrary grouping of the \npopulation can satisfy, independently of prior social relations or \nprior membership in other groups unconnected with the work in\n\f\nThe Technological Society ' (355\nhand.” In other words, human relations must not have an extra- \ntechnical basis. The individual’s prior milieu is of little importance; \nneither are his prior preferences or tendencies. Technique compen­\nsates for everything else. It is therefore reasonable to speak of \ntechnical “universalism.” Technique is the bond between men; it \nis both objective and indeterminate; it makes up for individual \ndeficiencies, admitting no excuses or individual dissociation.\nThe third characteristic of human relations is rationality. Human \nrelations are indispensable to the proper functioning of the or­\nganism as a whole. The organism is strictly rational, and relations \nintegrated into it must be conceived on a rational basis. Emotion or \nsentementality must not be allowed to disturb the mechanism. \nWhen the problem of emotion is considered, as, for example, in \n“molar microsociological analysis,” it is treated as a function of the \ngreater rationality of the group and of a more objective equilib­\nrium.\nIn the fourth place, these relations must be impersonal, estab­\nlished not on the basis of subjective choice and for personal rea­\nsons but on the basis of their optimum validity. Of course, subjec­\ntive choice and personal reasons must also be dealt with insofar \nas they influence the technician, but they are stripped of spon­\ntaneous validity;-they are only one element in the situation.\nScott and Lynton, in a rather more versatile study made in \n1953, confirm Moore’s analysis. According to them, in the technical \ncomplex which our society has become, and which is destroying \nevery kind of community, it is necessary to compensate for man’s \nnatural incapacity to sustain human relations in a technical uni­\nverse. This must be done not only for man’s sake but also because \nhuman relations are technically indispensable to the progress of \ngreat enterprises. It is necessary, therefore, to organize groups in \nthese enterprises, groups which are responsible but also sufficiently \ndirected to serve the common end, productivity. Then it is neces­\nsary to reproduce natural conditions artificially, so that human re­\nlations can be established. For example, the enterprise can be given \nan administrative structure that reproduces a spontaneous organi­\nzation.\nThe technique of so-called human relations, developed to adapt \nthe individual to the technical milieu, to force him to accept his \nslavery, to make him find happiness by the “normalization” of his\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES356)\nrelations with his group and integrate him into that group to an \never greater degree— this technique is characteristic of the fakeries \nand shams with which men must be provided if the conflicts pro­\nvoked by life in a technicized environment are to be avoided. As \na remedy it does not amount to much, but as a symptom of techni­\ncal reinforcement, it is important. We can say that these personal \nrelations are also techniques, that they are not a counterweight to \nother techniques, but that they bring about the application of tech­\nnique in the most personal and immediate area of human activi­\nties: man’s relations with other men. They alleviate the rigors of \nthe human condition— but only by forcing man to submit to them \nmore completely. They facilitate both human life and the action of \nthe machinery, improve production while subordinating human \nspontaneity to the mathematical calculations of the technicians. In \nshort, they are a kind of lubricating oil, but scarcely a means by \nwhich men can recover a sense of worth, personality, and authen­\nticity. On the contrary, they are a delusion which desiccate the \nindividual’s desire for anything better. Man is doubtless made more \ncomfortable by techniques of human relations; but these techniques \nare wholly oriented toward compelling man to submit to forced \nlabor. Machine and productivity are in the driver’s seat.\nAll I have said concerning the technique of human relations is as \ntrue of a socialist as of a capitalist society. “Socialist rivalry” is only \na psychological tool to force men to work harder. The effort to \nintegrate man into large-scale enterprises is n o t  restricted to capi \ntalism; it stems from technical investigations which are universally \nvalid. The most that can be said is that under capitalism psycho­\nlogical techniques are concentrated on the problem of integrating \nthe individual into private enterprise- Under socialism they are \nmore generalized.\nNone of this arises from human malevolence, or from some “sys­\ntem,” but from the simple fact that other techniques are sought to \nanswer the problems of industrial mechanization. There is no op­\nposition between mechanical techniques, on the one hand, and or­\nganizational and psychological techniques, on the other, so that \nthe latter balance the former. Such a relationship is valid, but only \nwithin the larger technical phenomenon, within the universal \nscheme whereby men are determined as objects by the whole tech-\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 357\nnical complex with a view to efficiency. Hence, as I have observed \nin so many other connections, the instrumentalities which permit \nman to survive, and even be happy, subject him as much and even \nmore than the other techniques to the technical ideal, which is in­\ndependent of all real humanism. The correlated growth of machine \nand organization prove this point. The organization of work, psy­\nchological research, the apparent adaptation of the machine to the \nhuman being— these in fact permit the aggrandizement of the me­\nchanical. The greater the aggrandizement, the more society re­\nquires that countermeasures be taken; but since the countermeas­\nures are themselves of a technical nature, they allow the sphere of \nthe mechanical to develop even further in a vicious circle. To be­\nlieve that humanist remedies will indeed palliate the drawbacks \nof the machine is to think of the machine as a static fact. It is noth­\ning of the kind. The progress of the machine depends on the pro­\nposed humanist remedies, and they in turn are rendered obsolete \nby each new mechanical development.\nI should like to point out one last fact; it touches upon a tender \npoint, and such a brief treatment may shock some people. Labor \nand trade unions made their appearance as the great human pro­\ntest against the inhuman character of capitalism and its exploita­\ntion of the workers. However, in all countries labor unionism has \ncompletely lost its original character and become a purely techni­\ncal organization. This seems to be undeniable, whether we study \nunionism in its Soviet form as a state organism or in its American \nform as an adjunct to production. In both cases trade unionism no \nlonger represents a fighting force, but rather a technical adminis­\ntration. At the moment unionism is still a fighting force in France \nand Italy, but in such an impersonal and organized form that the \noutcome is clear.\nOnce again, the result appears to be technical. The worker is be­\ncoming more and more \"organizable.” He is trapped in labor or­\nganizations which are becoming increasingly compulsory and in­\ncreasingly efficient. He gets habituated to them and even feels a \nneed for them. Moreover, the modem separation between person­\nality and work favors surrender to organization. The worker easily \nyields to the conviction that by contributing to his own organiza­\ntion he will be able to modify the broad outlines of the system and\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES358)\nalleviate his own discomforts. He does not realize that the organi­\nzation he is enrolled in is itself part of the complex of technical \norganisms of depersonalization. What we have here is a hoax, in \nthe Marxist sense of the term. The actual function of unionism is \nto support technical progress. It seeks a profound transformation of \nthe condition of the workers through objective industrial organiza­\ntion, independent of the idea of capitalist profit. It finds unorgan­\nized labor insupportable; this is also its attitude toward the inde­\npendent workers who have not felt the burden of the machine on \ntheir life and work. Unionism has no concept of the worker except \nin the double framework of factory and union, both in a technical \nsense.\nWhen workers are organized, they are complying with the law \nof technical progress which requires all forms of human life to \nbecome organized. This explains the facility with which the un­\nions, once they have been tightly constructed, pass into the condi­\ntion of total social organization. They continue to constitute an \nopposing force to certain men and economic tendencies, but they \nno longer represent a revolutionary force with respect to basic \nstructures. On the contrary, they have become a part of these \nstructures. The worker thinks that he is organizing freely and ex­\npressing his personality; but in so doing, he is merely yielding to \nthe technical imperatives to which he is subject through the me­\nchanical element in his work.\nI have no thought of denying the educational value of the un­\nions or the contributions they have made to the improvement of \nthe workers’ lot. I have been concerned merely to reflect (on a very \ndifferent plane) to what a degree trade unionism has developed \nconcurrently with technical progress and how it stands in im­\nmediate relation to technical imperatives. The worker through his \nunions is intensifying his own thralldom to techniques, augmenting \ntheir powers of organization, and completing his own integration \ninto that very movement from which, it may be, unionism had \noriginally hoped to free him.\nVocational Guidance. Research on human beings at work has led to \nthe differentiation of a number of categories of individuals accord­\ning to their greater or lesser aptitudes for adaptation, for example, \nto rationalized industrial labor. Some workers adapt themselves \nwithout difficulty to assembly-line production, whereas others be-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 5 9\ncome neurotic. This poses the problem of distinguishing various \nhuman categories of adaptability.\nA new technique, vocational guidance, is the answer here. It \nclaims to be able to reveal every person’s vocational aptitude and to \nguide him into the most suitable vocation, the vocation he will be \nnaturally adapted to, the vocation in which he will do the best \njob with the most enjoyment.\nUnfortunately, the first-rate work of Pierre Naville concerning \nthis technique has demonstrated that its claims are not in complete \ncorrespondence with technical reality. I do not wish to consider \nthe first part of his argument, which is exclusively Marxist. There \nare no natural aptitudes, he states; therefore vocational guidance \ncould not possibly discover them. This point is of course, debat­\nable for non-Marxists. The remainder of his argument is inde­\npendent of the first part and self-sufficient.\nBefore turning to Naville’s work, I would like to add that there is \nno question here of denying the value of testing. Tests as a whole \nyield trustworthy and worthwhile information. Except for certain \nreservations about detail, we can consider this technique efficient. \nBut in order to estimate its value correctly, we must “situate” it. \nTechniques in the modem world cannot be separated from one \nanother; and as a consequence the technique of vocational guid­\nance must be integrated into the complex of all the other tech­\nniques, for example, into the system of political and economic \ntechniques.\nNaville shows with precision that what we call vocational guid­\nance answers the requirements of capitalist economic techniques. \nAs though by accident, the technique “discovers” in the individ­\nuals examined precisely the aptitudes which are essential to the \nneeds of the capitalist economy. Thus, in France during the period \nof unemployment from 1932 to 1937, vocational guidance system­\natically diverted young people from such overcrowed trades as \nmechanics, textile work, and so on. The period from 1937 to 1939 \nwitnessed the development of metallurgy, and vocational guid­\nance “discovered” the vocation of metallurgist. In 1940 it was turn­\ning up a great number of agricultural vocations.\nThis should not be taken to mean that vocational guidance is \nthe tool of capitalist or governmental whim. Nor does it mean that \nvocational guidance is an imprecise technique. It means simply\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES360)\nthat there is a great flexibility in human potentialities and that \nvocational guidance modified these potentialities in accordance \nwith the suggestions of other techniques.\nConsider what would happen if vocational guidance proceeded \nto isolate itself from other techniques; for example, if it considered \nfirst and exclusively the aptitude of the individual. The result \nwould be Otto Neurath’s nonsensical system, which would never­\ntheless be the only logical system if one were to insist that the \nexclusive preoccupation of vocational guidance is to find the best \njob for the individual in terms of his aptitudes. Neurath envisages \na kind of plan of three to five years’ duration, based on the in­\ndividual’s aptitudes as discerned by vocational guidance. The econ­\nomy would be founded on these aptitudes. If vocational guidance \ndiscovered no mechanics, machine shops would be suppressed. If, \npresumably, it discovered no teachers, the schools would have to \nbe closed. If, on the other hand, vocational guidance were to un­\ncover a supply of mechanics after a number of years, the dis­\nmantled machine shops would be reopened. It need scarcely be \nsaid that chaos would reign in the field of economics. But such a \nsystem would be the only logical one if we really were concerned \nexclusively with the primacy of the individual If we really wished \nto take into consideration only the individual’s aptitudes, we would \nhave to tailor the economic system to them. The obvious impos­\nsibility of such a system demonstrates that it is senseless to apply \nthe rule of the primacy of the individual and that vocational guid­\nance cannot be isolated from the other techniques.\nNaville, on the other hand, wishes to integrate vocational guid­\nance as far as possible into the technical complex; he maintains \nthat this can be realized only under socialism. He takes as his \nexample the Soviet Union, where vocational guidance tries to dis­\ncover not so much intrinsic aptitudes as potentialities for adapta­\ntion, that is, adaptability. Basically, the Soviets believe it nec­\nessary to discover not the individual’s predestination but his \nadaptability. Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting \nthe individual, through education, to planned manpower require­\nments. Vocational guidance is thus subordinated to planning tech­\nnique. For example, a five-year plan may require a certain number \nof miners for that period. Vocational guidance then has the task^ \nof seeking out from among the twelve- and thirteen-year-olds the\n\f\nThe Technological Society (361\nones adaptable to this function. It institutes forthwith a twofold \noperation of general education focused on the particular trade \nand on the psychic, mechanical, and physiological adaptability of \nthe candidates. The plan thus obtains the necessary manpower; \nthe individual candidates are effectively adapted to the required \nlabor, since they have been recruited at an early enough age and \neducated from the beginning in a precise direction. The em­\nphasis again is on insuring the happiness of the individual through \nadaptation. The assumption is that the individual will be happy \nwhen he is synchronized with his trade.\nSoviet orientation toward vocational guidance is identical with \ncertain recent tendencies which have appeared in America. In a \nreport to UNESCO on technical education and vocational guid­\nance, Margaret Mead wrote: “Since education must respond, not \nto the present but to the future needs of society, it is necessary to \nforecast constantly and as far as possible in advance the evolution \nof vocational structures.” This can only mean that the individual \nmust be educated and adapted in advance to his future job as a \nfunction of anticipated technical progress. In Mayo’s analyses and \nin Lynton’s report to UNESCO, one finds similarly precise expres­\nsions of the conditions of community survival in the technical \nworld. The issue in all these cases is the rigorous adaptation of the \nindividual to the world of technique, even going as far as the “re­\nproduction of certain modes of action and forms of spontaneous \norganization.” More precise expression of technical intrusion into \nlife could scarcely be imagined.\nIt must not be thought that Naville’s version of vocational guid­\nance restricts human potentialities. On the contrary, it is meant to \nenlarge the child’s possibilities of adaptation. By means of this \ntechnique, according to Naville, “certain newly acquired habits \nwill appear, thanks to which the individual will be able to partici­\npate in the whole continuum of social effort . . . His needs will \nbe guided into a system of new habits which the economic milieu \nbequeathes to him . . . Adaptation will no longer be something \nnatural, but will be acquired at the cost of efforts which will be \nof short or long duration depending on the complexity of the \ntask.”\nIn this connection, we are assured that “vocational guidance \nwill permit the basic satisfaction of any rational need.” I am con-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES362)\nvinced that this statement is exact. The individual so educated \nwill be satisfied. But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that \nvocational guidance is in the service of human beings. An arsenal \nof preconceptions and undemonstrable formulas would be needed \nto sustain such a thesis. These presuppositions are as follows: \n(1) The moment the individual finds himself in a socialist system, \nhis complexes disappear. (2) The moment an institution is inte­\ngrated into a socialist system, it changes character. (3) The mo­\nment the individual’s needs are satisfied, he becomes happy. (4) \nThe moment social harmony is established, every man integrated \ninto that harmonious system realizes his human vocation. (5) The \nmoment the individual escapes from capitalism, he is free. Such \nnonsense is only a way of refusing to consider facts or to look reality \nin the face. The facts are clear enough. In isolation from certain \nother techniques, vocational guidance is useless. Put back into its \ntrue context, it becomes simply a means for subordinating man to \nthe requirements of economic technique. Even when the task of \ndiscovering aptitudes is attributed to vocational guidance, as, for \nexample, in Antoine Mas’s \"personnel mechanograph,” there is \nnevertheless a substantial consideration of “ad-aptitude,” to use \nNaville’s word, and selection is made in terms of it.\nOnce again we are confronted with a mechanism of adaptation \nwhich deprives man of freedom and responsibility, makes him \ninto a “thing,” and puts him where he is most desirable from the \npoint of view of another technique, that is where he is most \nefficient.\nWe can also state that a kind of encounter is taking place be­\ntween vocational guidance and the “new school.” Vocational guid­\nance is not obligatory in France. It might even be said that it does \nnot yet exist as a technique. It is still an advisory organ, nothing \nmore. The trend, however, is unmistakable. The number of children \ncounseled went from 60,000 in 1944 to 250,000 in 1950, and, it is \nestimated, an average of 75 per cent of the parents followed the \nadvice of the vocational counselor. (The actual figure grew slowly \nfrom 73 per cent in 1944 to 78 per cent in 1950.) As to the long­\nterm effects of guidance upon those guided, it need only be re­\nmarked that either the counselor was right or the counseled child, \nonce embarked on a trade, is faced with an accomplished fact. \nPractically speaking, there is no retreat, and in fact, a retreat is\n\f\nThe Technological Society (363\nseldom desired. The statement that vocational guidance, consider­\ning its rate of growth, is not obligatory in reality signifies very \nlittle.\nAn analysis of the method itself should be made. Although the \ntests employed at the moment are not very dangerous, the aim of \nvocational guidance is to card-index the individual totally (natu­\nrally, for his own good), and it is unlikely that its practitioners will \nremain very long content with the common psychotechnical tests. \nThey will want to go much further, to make systematic investiga­\ntions of emotional tendencies and to explore the child’s instinctive \nnature, to inquire into the basic elements in the child’s psychic \nand moral make-up. Tests like the so-called TAT (“Thematic Ap­\nperception Test”) already aim in this direction. Another and balder \nway of putting it is that vocational guidance represents a totali­\ntarian takeover of the young.\nBut since such a takeover lies in the logic of the system, I hardly \nthink it can be prevented. 1 shall content myself with referring the \ninterested reader to the excellent critique of the system contained \nin William Hollingsworth Whyte’s The Organization Man. \nPropaganda. Here we are faced with a new system of human tech­\nniques, more complex than the others we have studied, since it \ninvolves techniques of different natures, partly hierarchical and \npartly synthetic. We do not even have a term to describe this \nsystem. Propaganda is too limited, but it comes closest to the fact.* \nThe term supposes state action and also mass action on public \nopinion. However, the broader phenomenon we are considering \nhere includes private action and individualized action as well.\nThe prime consideration is the union of two very different cate­\ngories of technique which yield this new system of human tech­\nnique. The first is a complex of mechanical techniques (principally \nradio, press, and motion pictures) which permit direct communi­\ncation with a very large number of persons collectively, while \nsimultaneously addressing each individual in the group. These \ntechniques possess an extraordinary power of persuasion and a \nremarkable capacity to bring psychic and intellectual pressure \nto bear. The second category consists of a complex of psychological \n(and even psychoanalytical) techniques which give access to exact\n•Here I am  giving the briefest summary.

It can thus be motivated with \nconsiderable confidence in the results.\nA number of techniques have here been brought to a common \nfocus so as to produce a nearly certain result. It is known in ad­\nvance that the projected image will almost infallibly produce the \ndesired reflex. The technical phenomenon under consideration \nunites the two categories into an inseparable whole. The question \narises how and why this has come about and whether man has \nwilled it.\nIf the press had been devoted exclusively to serial stories, and the \nradio to music, it might not have been necessary to bring in psy­\nchoanalytic methods. But even this is not certain. What could be \nmore innocent in appearance than comic strips? The deep in­\nfluence of these “comics” on the reader is demonstrable, as is their \nusefulness from the sociological point of view. And what could \nseem more harmless than an American musical comedy film? Yet \nwe are all aware of their economic importance.\nEven if the radio or the press had been exclusively devoted to \namusement, however, there would be this problem: on what basis \ncould or should these techniques be restricted? The moment they \ncould be applied to other spheres (politics, for example), they \nwere applied, and applied guilelessly, without anyone having, at \nleast in the beginning, any clear idea of their utility. As soon as \nthey entered the realm of politics, it became evident that they had \nto serve not only to educate but also to convince. There is no such \nthing as purely objective information. To object that it was man’s \nfault that technique did not remain objective is tantamount to \nstating that it was man’s fault to be human. From the moment \nthese techniques were put to use, they had to operate as efficiently \nas possible, which meant that other techniques for understanding \nman had to be drawn into the system.\nThe totalitarian state is very often accused of having.originated \nthe conjunction of techniques. This is Monnerot’s opinion. The fact \nis that private capitalism did indeed initiate this conjunction; con­\nditions under capitalism were more propitious than elsewhere. Ad­\nvertising, well before propaganda proper, introduced the concep­\ntion of efficiency in this field. The problem was to convince a large \nnumber of persons, all typed as “average,” to perform some simple \naction, for example, to buy a given object. It was necessary to be\n\f\nThe Technological Society (365\nconvincing with limited arguments and few words, which might \nwell be lost among hundreds of others. Conditions in advertising \nwere much more favorable to the conjunction of mechanical and \npsychological means than, say, political conditions at the beginning \nof the twentieth century. At that time attempts at political per­\nsuasion were addressed only to the elite. There was a multiplicity \nof political and doctrinaire arguments, but only a few propagan­\ndists means. Propagandists inertia in politics was the result. Po­\nlitical persuasion had as its aim purely intellectual conviction, \nwhereas in advertising theendwasto produce reflex action.\nLarge commercial enterprises were the first to supplement me­\nchanical techniques with the very efficient means available through \npsychological technique. By 1910 this conjunction was an accom­\nplished fact. A  kind of maladroit political propaganda first came \ninto use during the First World War. It was often completely inept \nbecause it disregarded psychological laws and was, in effect, pure \nhokum. But it became scientific with the Russian Revolution and \nthen with Hitlerism. Today all states without exception exploit the \nsystem of political propaganda created by the union of the two \ntechnical complexes.\nWhat then are the principal directions taken by propaganda tech­\nniques? The system of conditioned reflexes has been exploited on \na large scale. The technique of measuring and producing such \nreflexes has been greatly developed. The reduction of political \ndoctrines to programs, of programs to slogans, of slogans to pic­\ntures (the direct reflex-stimulating images) has been studied. Sys­\ntematic efforts are available to create conditioned reflexes, either \nthrough education (as, for example, under Nazism or under Com­\nmunism) or on the basis of already existing, spontaneous reflexes \n(for example, the American use of erotic reflexes in war propa­\nganda).\nThe propaganda mechanisms of the totalitarian states have been \nstudied in detail by Tchakotin. Propaganda techniques in the \nUnited States have been stressed much less. But that does not \nmean that instances of propaganda on a grand scale are lacking \nthere. It became necessary, for example, to force the American \npeople to participate in the war and to impress a war psychology \nupon them by creating certain reflexes. The Americans, protected \nby their two oceans, did not “feel” they were at war. War for them\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES366)\nwas not a living reality and had to be made so. Understandably, \nthe feeling of war and civilian involvement in it could be produced \nonly by the enormous pressure of advertising and total propaganda \non the human psyche. It was necessary to use the so-called obses­\nsional technique, to subject the citizen to propaganda without \nletup, never allowing him to be alone with Jffmself. In the street \nhe is confronted with posters, loud-speakers, ceremonies, and meet­\nings; at work, with handbills and “industrial mobilization”; in his \namusements, with motion-picture and theatrical propaganda; at \nhome, with newspaper and radio propaganda. All these means \nconverge on the same point. All exert the same kind of action on \nthe individual and are of such overpowering magnitude that he \nceases to be consciously aware of them.\nThis last is the greatest importance. Propaganda must become as \nnatural as air or food. It must proceed by psychological inhibi­\ntion and the least possible shock. The individual is then able to \ndeclare in all honesty that no such thing as propaganda exists. \nIn fact, however, he has been so absorbed by it that he is literally \nno longer able to see the truth. The natures of man and propa­\nganda have become so inextricably mixed that everything depends \nnot on choice or on free will, but on reflex and myth. The pro­\nlonged and hypnotic repetition of the same complex of ideas, the \nsame images, and the same rumors conditions man for the as­\nsimilation of his nature to propaganda.\nIn addition, human emotions such as hate and resentment are \nexploited. The procedure is not so much obsessional as suggestive, \nand depends on the collective fixation of these emotions on a given \nadversary. Here we witness the crowning absurdity, a completely \nautomatic development of emotions. To exploit resentments, it is \nsufficient merely to send the individual on his way, equipped with \na very simple set of “directions for use.” Later on, one observes a \nreconstitution of the individual personality around the selected \n“fixed point” on the basis of the strength of his resentments. Sup­\npose, for example, that the adversary has been designated as the \nauthor of all the individual’s misfortunes and sufferings. .(The \nbourgeoisie plays this role for the Communists, as the Jews played \nit for the Nazis.) After such suggestions have been launched, there \nis a surge of human resentment among the people. Like a flock of \nsheep, they stampede much further than they had actually been\n\f\nThe Technological Society (367\ncommanded to go, in obedience to another instinct which comes \ninto play and which causes them to hurl themselves on the object of \ntheir resentment like a dog on a cat. Incidentally, this explains \nwhy there is no ‘‘criminal\" in these cases. Pogroms are seldom \nordered by the authorities. One need only manipulate popular \nresentments to bring them about.\nThe will to self-justification, which is latent in every individual, \ncan also be exploited. It involves the need for a scapegoat; but \nindividuals have difficulty finding a personal scapegoat. Propa­\nganda offers them a collective goat to which they are able to trans­\nfer evil and sin, thereby feeling justified, authenticated, and puri­\nfied. In all countries where this form of propaganda is effective, \ncrime diminishes (not the least of the boasts of totalitarian regimes, \nCommunist and Fascist alike). Morality makes headway. We no \nlonger have to create for ourselves enemies to slay. We have ene­\nmies, ready-made for us by propaganda, whom it is lawful to kill. \nIt is as plain as a pikestaff that to kill a bourgeois is not a crime. \nMoreover, the introduction of scapegoats means that conflict is no \nlonger on a social or political plane but on a moral plane of good \nand evil. In exploiting the device of the scapegoat, propaganda \nleads people to transfer evil to the adversary. The adversary here \nbecomes the generalized incarnation of evil, whereas in the ex­\nploitation of resentment the adversary appears as the cause of \nmisfortune. This incarnation indicates that there is no rational basis \nfor hate; it results solely from subconscious mechanisms. This ex­\nplains a surprising statement made by Hitler in Mein Kampf: “It \nis necessary to suggest to the people that the most varied enemies \nall belong to the same category; and to lump all adversaries to­\ngether so that it will appear to the mass of our own partisans that \nthe struggle is being waged against a single enemy. This fortifies \ntheir faith in their rights and increases their exasperation against \nthose who would assail them.” Hitler s statement would have been \ncompletely irrational if it had been made about person-to-person \ncombat, about personal reasons for conflict. But from the moment \npropaganda begins to operate, there is a loss of the sense of reality, \na confusion of motives, an identification of opposites, and an inter­\nplay of accusations— all of which greatly enhance the operation \nof subconscious influences. Everything more or less confusedly \nresented as being evil is transferred to the official enemy. Through\n\f\n368 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nthe influence of propaganda, a subconscious transference takes \nplace. But instead of the psychoanalyst who causes the transference \nof guilt feelings to himself, there is a propaganda machine which \ncauses us to make the transference to the generalized enemy. \nTechnique thus creates a separation between all “absolutely good” \npersons, who are collectively justified and who represent political, \nsocial, and historic virtue, and all “absolutely evil” persons,' in \nwhom no worth or virtue is to be found. The phenomenon made a \nfeeble appearance, on the national plane, in the 1914 \"War of Law \nand Civilization,” but it was too weak to bring about complete \ncollective transference. Today we are more successful, but the line \nof demarcation between good and evil is less national than social \nand political.\nPropaganda also manipulates, on a lesser scale, the so-called \nOedipus complex and our emotions concerning the \"father.” These \ntechniques are still halting, but it is quite probable that they will \nbecome efficient in the near future.\nPropagandistic manipulations take place under all forms of gov­\nernment and in all walks of life. It may be said that we live in a \nuniverse which is psychologically subversive. Even so, modem \nman has no clear conception of the extent of the phenomenon. \nExperience cannot reveal it to him; he would have to be outside \nlooking in. We in France are fortunate in living in a country \nwhere propaganda is still remarkably inefficient. In addition, we \nare acquainted with the technique of “social psychoanalysis.” as \nimported by the pre-1938 Berlin Institute of Applied Psychology \nand by numerous American institutes and research committees/ \nIt is scarcely necessary to add that all propaganda technicians in \nsearch of the “one best way” loudly proclaim the value of ex­\nploiting the great subconscious motifs I have described.\nIt is only fair to wonder what consequences these propagandistic \nmanipulations will have. The real consequences are not discernible \nbecause the mechanisms have been operating for too short a time. \nAnd, of course, when the consequences finally appear, we still \nwill not recognize them. We will have been so absorbed and ma­\nnipulated, rendered so indifferent that objective knowledge on\nf For exam ple, The Committee of Human Development, Chicago; The Institute for \nPublic Opinion Research, Princeton; The Heller Committee, California; and so on.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (369\nthis score will be impossible. We will no longer even have any idea \nof what men might once have been.\nSome effects of propaganda, however, are already clear.\n1) The critical faculty has been suppressed by the creation of \ncollective passions. The well-known phenomenon of “reciprocal \nsuggestion” has made collective passion a very different force from \nindividual passion. We know that individual passion is itself in­\nimical to the critical faculty, but the critical faculty can still be \nexercised if some equilibrium can be established between criti­\ncism and passion. In the collective passion created by technique \n(of which technique itself is sometimes the object), the critical \nfaculty, which is peculiar to the intellectual organization of the \nindividual, is excluded. As Monnerot says flatly: \"There is no such \nthing as a collective critical faculty.” Because technique acts upon \nmen collectively, the passions it provokes— which exist in every­\nbody— are amplified. The suppression of the critical faculty—  \nman’s growing incapacity to distinguish truth from falsehood, the \nindividual from the collectivity, action from talk, reality from \nstatistics, and so on— is one of the most evident results of the \ntechnical power of propaganda. Human intelligence cannot resist \npropaganda’s manipulation of its subconscious.\n2) A good social conscience appears with the suppression of the \ncritical faculty. Technique provides justification to everybody \nand gives all men the conviction that their actions are just, good, \nand in the spirit of truth. This conviction is the stronger because it \nis collectively shared. The individual finds the same conviction in \nhis fellow workers and neighbors and feels himself strengthened in \nit through the implicit communion of media such as the radio. In \ncountries where propaganda technique is exploited, there is a de­\ncrease in neurosis as well as in crime. We can believe the wartime \nstatistics of the Nazis and the Americans because they fit so well \nwith everything else we know. Conversely, whenever for some \nreason propaganda technique fails to instill a good collective social \nconscience, there is a sudden and brutal collapse of the sense of \nindividual justification, and individual morale falls drastically. \nThis, among other things, would explain the extraordinary in­\ncrease in neuroses in the United States after 1945. A similar situa­\ntion among the Germans may have other explanations, but I am \nconvinced that the sudden halting in the Nazi propaganda ma-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 7°)\nchine played a significant role in German postwar neurosis. The \nproblem in the United States has been so serious that it has led to \nthe dramatic development of psychoanalytic therapy in the past \nfew years. This development in reality represents a resumption, on \nan individual level, of the activity which collective technique had \nabandoned. When a good collective social conscience has been \ncreated, the individual becomes addicted to it, as to a drug. And \nwhen the Americans realize that individual psychoanalysis is more \ncostly, less efficient (because it cannot integrate the individual), \nand more difficult, they will return to a collective psychotherapeu­\ntic technique.\n3) Propaganda technique, moreover, creates a new sphere of \nthe “sacred.” As Monnerot puts it: “When an entire category of \nevents, beings, and ideas is outside criticism, it constitutes a sacred \nrealm, in contrast to the realm of the profane.” As a result of the \nprofound influence of the mechanisms of propaganda, a new zone \nof the forbidden is created in the heart of man, but it is artificially \ninduced, in contrast to the taboos of primitive societies. When \nthere is propaganda, we are no longer able to evaluate certain \nquestions, or even to discuss them. A series of protective reflexes \norganized by technique immediately intervene.\nTo summarize: the suppression of the critical faculty, the forma­\ntion of a good social conscience, and the creation of a sphere of \nthe sacred are all aspects of a single manifestation, the first and \nclearest consequence of the application of psychoanalytic mass \ntechniques. Incidentally, our analysis confirms a social phenome­\nnon frequently analyzed by modern sociologists: the “creation of \nthe masses.” These three elements add a new dimension to the \nmasses; the masses thereby gain an internal cohesion they did not \npossess naturally. A unifying psychism has come into being.\nA second consequence of the application of propaganda tech­\nniques is the creation of a kind of manipulability of the masses. \nHere again Monnerot gives a definition worth repeating. Accord­\ning to Monnerot, propaganda technique “has for its object the \nproduction and cultivation among the masses of certain predisposi­\ntions and a special facility for doing at a given moment whatever \nis strategically opportune. As political circumstances change, it is \nnecessary at intervals to cultivate successive predispositions.” This\n\f\nThe TechnologicalSociety (3 7 1\nis a remarkable notion; the use of certain propaganda techniques \nis not meant to entail immediate and definitive adhesion to a given \nformula, but rather to bring about a kind of long-range vacuity of \nthe individual. The individual, his soul massaged, emptied of his \nnatural tendencies, and thoroughly assimilated to the group, is \nready for anything. Propaganda’s chief requirement is not so much \nto be rational, well grounded, and powerful as it is to produce \nindividuals especially open to suggestion who can be easily set into \nmotion.\nTwo categories of propaganda must be distinguished. The first \nstrives to create a permanent disposition in its objects and con­\nstantly needs to be reinforced. Its goal is to make the masses \n“available,” by working spells upon them and exercising a kind of \nfascination. The second category involves the creation of a sort of \ntemporary impulsiveness in its objects. It operates by simple pres­\nsure and is often contradictory (since contradictory mass move­\nments are sometimes necessary). Of course, this dissociation can \nbe effective only after the propaganda technique has been com­\npletely fused with the popular mores and has become indispen­\nsable to the population. This stage may be reached quickly, as, for \nexample, in Germany in 1942, after only ten years of psychic ma­\nnipulation. The same result seems to have been obtained in the \nSoviet Union, where the masses have been conditioned to the fluc­\ntuations of the party line.\nA third consequence of technical propaganda manipulations is \nthe creation of an abstract universe, representing a complete re­\nconstruction of reality in the minds of its citizens. The new uni­\nverse is a verbal universe, to use the excellent phrase of Armand \nRobin, our keenest student of radio propaganda. Men fashion \nimages of things, events, and people which may not reflect reality \nbut which are truer than reality. These images are based on news \nitems which, as is the case in much of the world, are “faked.” \nTheir purpose is to form rather than to inform. Faking the news \nis systematically practiced by the Soviet radio, but the procedure is \nfound to a lesser degree in all countries. All of us are familiar with \nthe \"innocent” fraud of the illustrated newspapers in which a photo­\ngraph is accompanied by an ambiguous caption. A  shipyard, for \nexample, is indifferently described as a plant in one of the de­\nmocracies, or in die Soviet Union, or wherever. This kind of thing\n\f\n3 7*) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nrepresents the first step toward a sham universe. It is also indica­\ntive of an important element in today s psychology, the disappear­\nance of reality in a world of hallucinations. Man will be led to act \nfrom real motives that are scientifically directed and increasingly \nirresistible; he will be brought to sacrifice himself in a real world, \nbut for the sake of the verbal universe which has been fashioned \nfor him. We must try to grasp the profundity of this upheaval. The \nhuman being has enormous means at his disposal, and he acts upon \nand in the real world. But he acts in a dream: he seeks other ends \n(those the incantational magic of propaganda proposes for him) \nthan those he will really attain. The ends he is expected to reach \nare known only to the manipulators of the mass subconscious, and \nto them alone.\nAt this point, the reader will protest that our analysis may apply to \nothers, but not to him. But if he listens regularly to the radio, reads \nthe newspapers, and goes to the movies, the description does fit him. \nHe will not be aware of it because the essence of propaganda is to \nact upon the human subconscious but to leave men the illusion of \ncomplete freedom. The objection will be raised, in another vein, \nthat some countries do not exploit these propagandistic manipula­\ntory devices; for example, the democracies in general and the \nUnited States in particular.8  But here certain distinctions must be \nmade. Some democracies do not exploit the propaganda arsenal \nsimply because they cannot afford to do so. Others, like the United \nStates, exploit it only to a limited degree, during certain restricted \nperiods (for example, during wars, hot and cold) and only in cer­\ntain areas. However, such restraint cannot be imputed to demo­\ncratic scruples; these democracies simply do not yet feel the compel­\nling necessity to exploit propagandistic technique. As the present \nglobal struggle intensifies and world domination by one nation or \nanother becomes inevitable, the utilization of propaganda by the \ndemocracies will also become inevitable. The high priests of effi­\nciency will not recoil before the use of an instrument as efficient as \npropaganda, the more so because it fits the tenor of their culture \nand no longer shocks anyone’s “humanitarian” sentiments. When \nonce the masses have become inured to the practices of propa­\nganda techniques, it is impossible to turn back.\n.* Ellul: Propaganda* (1962).\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 7 3\nPropaganda activity entails two further consequences of a socio­\nlogical nature. Because these are obvious, they may be briefly \nsummarized. First, as we have already seen in our treatment of the \ntechniques of work, there is the psychological factor, which mani­\nfests itself in the arrested spiritual development of the worker. \nFriedmann believes that the worker would not experience this \narrest in a congenial environment, that is, in a favorable economic \nsystem. He has in mind a socialist regime, which he contends \nwould be the most,propitious working environment. In such an \nenvironment the worker, working without constraints, could ma­\nture. But it is clear that socialist manipulation of unconscious tend­\nencies by means of propaganda produces the same results as a real \nmodification of conditions. For example, in the social movement \nin the Soviet Union, which concentrates on productivity, it is not \neconomic facts that carry the workers along, but socialist propa­\nganda, the creation of a purely verbal universe. Workers react in \nexactly the same way under capitalism if they are sufficiently over­\nwhelmed by propaganda. This is what happened in the United \nStates on a temporary basis during the war years. And there is a \npermanent factor operating in the United States to facilitate the \napplication of propaganda technique: the rapidly developing and \nremarkable mechanism of public relations. This technique is a sys­\ntem of propaganda applied to all economic and human relations.\nA second consequence, in the political sphere, is the devaluation \n•f democracy. I revert here to an idea which we have already con­\nsidered but which is difficult to drive home. All of us, more or less, \ntake propaganda to be the defense of an idea or system. We hear \nconstantly that it cannot therefore be of any harm to the democra­\ncies. After all, there are a plurality of political parties employing \npropaganda to maintain opposing or even contradictory ideas; the \ncitizen has a free choice among them. Such a misapprehension \ncomes from a frighteningly elementary conception of propaganda. \nI have made it quite clear that propaganda is not the defense of an \nidea but the manipulation of the mob’s subconscious. The hope \nreposed in the contradictions of propaganda comes to this: the citi­\nzen receives a blow in the face from his neighbor on the right, \nwhich, fortunately, is compensated for by another blow from his \nneighbor on the left. If propaganda involved calm exposition of \npolitical theories among which the citizen might choose intelli-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 7 4 )\ngently, contradictions would be beneficial and would leave the \ncitizen a free man. But this is an impossibility, from the moment \nthe propagandist possesses material means for exerting action on \nthe mob and knowledge of the secret recesses of the human psy­\nche. The man who upholds a political theory presumably believes \nin it. I take the case of a politician who acts from conviction and \nnot from personal interest. He will indeed strive to present his \nconvictions in the best possible light and to secure the adherence \nof the greatest number of his fellow citizens. To do this he will of \ncourse make use of the most efficient means. So, like any totalitar­\nian, he will proceed to rape the mob propagandistically. And rape \nremains rape though it be effected by ten political parties ten times \nin a row. Altering the outward form does not alter the substance. \nThink of the parades, for instance, of Nazi Germany, the somber \nand fanatical rites of “blood and soil.” In the United States, the \nequivalent for the most part revolves about rites involving scantily \nclad girls. It is all a matter of temperament; the psychic aim is the \nsame. And it is ruinous to democracy.\nIn the operation of political parties, the exploitation of technical \nmeans on a large scale presupposes great financial resources. This \ntends to eliminate all minor parties completely or to reduce them \nto the shadowy role of hangers-on. The more intense the political \npropaganda struggle (and the more costly its execution), the \ngreater the tendency to reduce the operation of democracy to the \nopposition between two blocs. A citizen may have an original, \nvalid, and true political idea, one which might even have had \nevery chance of success with his fellow citizens. But if he does \nnot possess the millions necessary to elaborate it the length and \nbreadth of the country, it counts for nothing. The American democ­\nracy is no longer in its youth, when propaganda consisted of one \nman speaking directly to other men.\nIn the devaluation of democracy, the influences of the propa­\nganda technique work on men as well as parties. The individual, \nforced to submit to contradictory streams of propaganda, not only \nis incapable of preserving freedom of choice, of choosing between \ndifferent doctrines, but is eliminated from the political operation \ncompletely. He literally no longer exists— and this comes about in \nproportion to the contradictoriness of the propaganda. He is inte- \ngratedinto a sociological group and votes as the group votes.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 7 5\nWe come here to an important conclusion: to the degree that \npropaganda is a technique, it has its own personal identity and \nspecificity. But it acts toward an unalterably fixed end. It is mere \nvanity to wish to distinguish a technique as good or bad according \nto its end. Whether technique acts to die advantage of a dictator or \nof a democracy, it makes use of the same weapons, acts on the in­\ndividual and manipulates his subconscious in identical ways, and \nin the end leads to the formation of exactly the same type of hu­\nman being. Whether 99 per cent of the citizens cast their ballot for \na dictator or for the various parties in a democracy, whether or not \nthe political structures of the different regimes formally differ, the \nwell-kneaded citizen, upon whom both regimes ultimately depend, \nbecomes through the operation of technique progressively indis­\ntinguishable in either. The problem is not merely political; we have \ncome upon it in every area of life. But we must distinguish be­\ntween two planes here: formal opinion and personal decision. \nThrough propaganda, we can train a man not to kill or not to \ndrink alcohol; or we can train him to kill or to smoke opium. The \nobjective result is different in either case. Sociologically, there is \nadmittedly a world of difference between dictatorship and democ­\nracy. But in both the moral problem is suppressed; the individual \nis simply an animal broken in to obey certain conditioned reflexes. \nIndeed, there may be a difference between dictatorship and de­\nmocracy on the plane of public health or statistics; but on the moral \nplane there is a fundamental identity when democracy achieves \nits ends through propaganda. The human effects of technique are \nindependent of the ideological end to which they are applied. \nAmusement. The techniques of amusement and diversion are dif­\nferent from the other human techniques we have considered. Ma­\nterially, these techniques are identical with those of propaganda: \nfilms, radio, newspapers, and, to a lesser degree, books and phono­\ngraph records. But the hierarchy of these means is not the same. For \nexample, the cinema has first place and plays a more important \nrole than the radio. By comparison, in the propaganda hierarchy \nradio is the instrument of choice.\nHere too we find the exploitation of techniques of the subcon­\nscious, but they are exerted with much less pressure. Moreover, \nthe range and sphere of these subconscious techniques is different \nAmusement seeks to distract, propaganda to lead. The principal\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES37 «)\ndifference, however, relates to spontaneity. Propaganda technique \nis calculated and deliberate, whereas amusement technique is \nspontaneous and nondeliberate. The former is the result of the \norganizer's decision; the latter, of the mob’s need.\nConsider the average man as he comes home from his job. Very \nlikely he has spent the day in a completely hygienic environment, \nand everything has been done to balance his environment and \nlessen his fatigue. However, he has had to work without stopping \nand under constant pressure; nervous fatigue has replaced muscu­\nlar fatigue. When he leaves his job, his joy in finishing his stint is \nmixed with dissatisfaction with a work as fruitless as it is incompre­\nhensible and as far from really productive work. At home he “finds \nhimself” again. But what does he find? He finds a phantom. If he \never thinks, his reflections terrify him. Personal destiny is fulfilled \nonly by death; but reflection tells him that for him there has not \nbeen anything between his adolescent adventures and his death, \nno point at which he himself ever made a decision or initiated a \nchange. Changes are the exclusive prerogative of organized tech­\nnical society, which one day may have decked him out in khaki to \ndefend it, and on another in stripes because he had sabotaged or \nbetrayed it  There was no difference from one day to the next. Yet \nlife was never serene, for newspapers and news reports beset him \nat the end of the day and forced on him the image of an insecure \nworld. If it was not hot or cold war, there were all sorts of acci­\ndents to drive home to him the precariousness of his life. Tom be­\ntween this precariousness and the absolute, unalterable determi­\nnateness of work, he has no place, belongs nowhere. Whether \nsomething happens to him, or nothing happens, he is in neither \ncase the author of his destiny.\nHie man of the technical society does not want to encounter his \nphantom. He resents being tom between the extremes of accident \nand technical absolutism. He dreads the knowledge that every­\nthing ends “six feet under.” He could accept the six-feet-under of \nhis life if, and only if, life had some meaning and he could choose, \nsay, to die. But when nothing makes sense, when nothing is the \nresult of free choice, the final six-feet-under is an abominable in­\njustice. Technical civilization has made a great error in not sup­\npressing death, the only human reality still intact\nMan is still capable of lucid moments about the future. Propa-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (377\nganda techniques have not been able wholly to convince him that \nlife has any meaning left. But amusement techniques have jumped \ninto the breach and taught him at least how to flee the presence of \ndeath. He no longer needs faith or some difficult asceticism to \ndeaden himself to his condition. The movies and television lead \nhim straight into an artificial paradise. Rather than face his own \nphantom, he seeks film phantoms into which he can project him­\nself and which permit him to live as he might have willed. For an \nhour or two he can cease to be himself, as his personality dissolves \nand fades into the anonymous mass of spectators. The film makes \nhim laugh, cry, wonder, and love. He goes to bed with the lead­\ning lady, kills the villain, and masters life’s absurdities. In short, he \nbecomes a hero. Life suddenly has meaning.\nThe theater presupposed an intellectual mechanism and left the \nspectator in some sense intact and capable of judgment. The mo­\ntion picture by means of its “reality” integrates the spectator so \ncompletely that an uncommon spiritual force or psychological ed­\nucation is necessary to resist its pressures. In any case, people go to \nthe movies to escape and consequently yield to its pressures. They \nfind forgetfulness, and in forgetfulness the honied freedom they do \nnot find in their work or at home. They live on the screen a life they \nwill never live in fact.\nIt will be said that dreams and hope have been the traditional \nmeans of escape in times of famine and persecution. But today \nthere is no hope, and the dream is no longer the personal act of an \nindividual who freely chooses to flee some “reality” or other. It is a \nmass phenomenon of millions of men who desire to help them­\nselves to a slice of life, freedom, and immortality. Separated from \nhis essence, like a snail deprived of its shell, man is only a blob of \nplastic matter modeled after the moving images.\nThere is a vast difference between the dreams and hopes of the \npast and those of the present. Formerly, with the conviction that \n“things would change,\" hope was a beacon illuminating the future. \nDreams represented flight, but flight into one’s own self. In motion \npictures, however, the future is not involved. On the strip of film, \nwhat ought to change has already changed. And the flight of cine­\nmatic dreams has nothing to do with the inner life; it concerns mere \nexternals. When people leave the movie theater, they are full of the \npossibilities they experienced in the shadows; they have received\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 78 )\ntheir dose of the inner life. Their problems too have undergone a \ntransformation. They are now problems posed by the film. And they \nhave the blissful, if contradictory, impression that these cinematic \nproblems, which occupy the whole field of their consciousness, are \nboth strong enough to put all vexations to flight and unreal enough \nnot to be troublesome. The modem passion for motion pictures is \ncompletely explained by the will to escape. Just as the tempo of \nwork or the authority of the state presupposes spiritual adhesion \nand hence propaganda, so the human condition under the regime \nof technique supposes the escapism which diversional techniques \noffer. One cannot but marvel at an organization which provides the \nantidote as it distills the poison.\nMan, emptied by the technical mechanism of all personal inter­\nests, sometimes finds himself at home. What shall he talk about? \nMan has always had one unfailing subject of conversation, life’s \nvexations. Not fear, nor anguish, despair, or passion. All that has \nalways been suppressed in his subconscious. But he has always \nbeen able to talk companionably about vexatious things, hail on \nhis vines, mildew, machinery out of order, a troublesome prostate, \nand so forth. Now technique intervenes, repairs everything, and \ncreates a world in which everything works well, or well enough. \nEven if some petty vexations persist, the individual feels no need \nto speak of them and turns toward the efficient silence-fillers, tele­\nvision and radio, prodigiously useful refuges for those who find that \nfamily life has become impossible. Jean Laloup and Jean Nelis \nevince a curious optimism when they write that radio and televi­\nsion have reconstituted the family. Television doubtless facilitates \nmaterial reunion. Because of it the children no longer go out in the \nevenings. The members of the family are indeed all present materi­\nally, but centered on the television set, they are unaware of one \nanother. If they cannot stand or understand one another, if they \nhave nothing to say, radio and television make this easy to bear by 1  \nre-establishing external relations and avoiding friction. Thanks to \nthese technical devices, it is no longer necessary for the members \nof a family to have anything at all to do with one another or even to \nbe conscious of the fact that family relations are impossible. It is no \nlonger necessary to make decisions. It is possible for a married \ncouple to live together a long time without ever meeting each \nother in the resonant emptiness of television. This too is a curious\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 7 9\nmeans of escape, of hiding from others instead of from oneself. It is \nthe modem mask man puts on every evening, which unfortunately, \nlacks the virtues of the ancient mask, demoniac and divine.\nOne of the best studies of the problem of the radio, that of Roger \nVeille, reminds us that the ear is the great “fault” in man. Through \nit he perceives the “silence of the infinite spaces”; it is the point of \norigin of his great disturbance. The ear, unlike the eye, evokes mys­\ntery and renunciation; it is the center of anguish and anxiety. And \nradio fills this opening, protecting man against the silence and the \nmystery by amusing him. The program makers know all this and \ncreate their programs as a function of this escapism, not for motives \nof crass commercialism or Machiavellianism (as some people seem \nto think), but because they themselves partake of the human con­\ndition and seek protection against its anguish. It follows, then, that \nthe radio makes a clean break between everyday social reality and \nthe dreams and narcotics which its duty is to dispense. To use the \nwords of Veille, it must be one of the “liberating distractions.” It \nmust deliver the individual from objective constraints. It is a pub­\nlic utility dealing in moral comfort, charged with offsetting the \ntragedies of family living, social pressures, and the vexations of \nmodem life The radio must compensate for the inhumanities cf \nlife in todays cities. In a milieu in which the human being is un­\nable to make true friendships or to have profound experiences, the \nradio must furnish him with the appearances of reality, acquaint­\nance, and human proximity; it must captivate and reassure him. \nBut Veille rightly inquires whether “the radio may not gradually \nhabituate to mere auditory images those to whom it gives the illu­\nsion of belonging; and, what is worse, condition them to the ab­\nsence of interlocutors.” Unfortunately, the answer to Veilles \nquestion is clear. There is no other comparable instrument of hu­\nman isolation. The radio, and television even more than the radio, \nshuts up the individual in an echoing mechanical universe in which \nhe is alone He already knew little enough about his neighbors, and \nnow the separation between him and his fellows is further \nwidened. Men become accustomed to listening to machines and \ntalking to machines, as, for example, with telephones and dicta­\nphones. No more face-to-face encounters, no more dialogue. In a \nperpetual monologue by means of which he escapes the anguish of \nsilence and the inconvenience of neighbors, man finds refuge in"

Television, because \nof its power of fascination and its capacity of visual and auditory \npenetration, is probably the technical instrument which is most \ndestructive of personality and of human relations. What man seeks \nis evidently an absolute distraction, a total obliviousness of him­\nself and his problems, and the simultaneous fusion of his con­\nsciousness with an omnipresent technical diversion.\nIn diversion we are at a stage of development in which technique \nanswers the needs of men in a technical society, but a society in \nwhich they are still free to use or not to use the available technical \nmeans. ‘‘If you wish to escape,” says technique, “you are welcome \nto try.” Modern men, however, are beginning to be aware of their \nneed at all costs not to challenge the technical situation, and to \nrecognize that technical means exist to meet this need. Take, for \nexample, the extraordinary success of Butlin’s vacation camps in \nGreat Britain. Butlin grasped the fact that in a world at once exact­\ning and depersonalizing in the extreme, the vacation most men \nprefer must be a genuine vacuum, an ever greater depersonaliza­\ntion which gives the impression of freedom but which never allows \nthe individual to come face to face with himself, even materially. \nTo achieve this end, Butlin in 1938 organized his “family vacation \ncamps.” The vacationer lives in a crowd on a strict timetable judi­\nciously arranged so that each day will be different, giving the \nimpression of constant novelty and variety. Games, songs, theater, \neating, “fun” succeed one another at a rapid tempo from seven \no’clock in the morning until midnight. \"The important thing,” says \nButlin, “is that no one is ever left to himself even for a moment.” \nEverything takes place in a spirit of gaiety and liveliness and under \nthe direction of game leaders who are “specialists.” All available \nmeans are employed to persuade the individual that he is happy. \nSince each camp can accommodate four thousand persons, there is \nlittle difficulty in arranging for the vacationer to pass his holiday, \nwhich lasts a fortnight, among a crowd of people. The whole thing \nrepresents an elaborate and rigorous enterprise for becoming un­\nconscious, carried out by a technique described in detail by Butlin \nhimself. Butlin minces no words. The problem, as he sees it, is to \nmake his customers systematically lose consciousness, not as be­\nfore from .political motives, but from motives of pure entertain-"

    "raw_text": "The Technological Society (381\nment. Here is technique put to the service of a kind of Pascalian \ndistraction. Not exactly the same kind, since it is not so much a \nmatter of dodging the dilemma of man facing eternity as of dodg­\ning the conflict between man and his situation in this life; of for­\ngetting to meditate not so much on the two infinitives (something \nmost men are incapable of) as on the obvious crashing absurdity \nof life in a technical world. The average man is inevitably con­\nscious of this. He must therefore becloud his consciousness at any \ncost, and in this, it seems, he is in essential accord with the needs \nof a technical society. Our thesis is verified by the prodigious suc­\ncess of Butlin’s camps, a success which is perhaps the most aston­\nishing thing about them. In 1947, four hundred thousand persons \nvacationed in them, and the number has been growing steadily. \nAnd bear in mind that these figures represent Englishmen, who by \ntheir very nature would seem the most hostile to this kind of thing.\nThis demonstrates the complete adaptation of technical amuse­\nments to technical society and to their sociological function. How \nillusory is the effort to make of the motion pictures an educative \nart and a means of instruction! Art films and films with philosophic \nor political intent simply do not correspond to the wishes of the \nmovie-going public. It can, of course, be legitimately maintained \nthat motion pictures are nonetheless a means of \"educating’*  the \npublic. But here we must guard against a certain confusion; educa­\ntion of the spectator’s taste and understanding takes place, but \nonly incidentally. The clouding of his consciousness is paramount, \nand art and science can contribute to this end. The film can suc­\nceed only if it puts art to the service of a sociologically necessary \nand technically possible enterprise; only if art (and indoctrination \ndisguised as science) becomes the new means of wrenching men \nfrom reality. If this were not the case, the public would not have \npatronized films like the first ones of Orson Welles.\nSpontaneous or organized mechanisms of entertainment such as \nI have described are useful only to the degree that propaganda \ntechnique is undeveloped. Propaganda, as it develops, tends to \nassimilate amusement, which either makes its appearance as an \nefficient propaganda medium or, at a later stage, is exploited for \npurposes of human adaptation.\nThis last makes it impossible to agree with Veilles suggestion \nthat the Swedish or Russian radio is not concerned with “distrac-\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES3 $ * )\ntions,” with building up a social structure of lies and soporifics, be­\ncause the citizens of these states have been “set free\" and no \nlonger “feel the wearisome continuity of daily obligations.” Veille, \nit may be noted, tends implicitly to see in this fact one of the benefi­\ncial effects of socialism. In reality, the condition he describes is \ndue to the fact that the Swedes are the most \"integrated” and \nadapted of all mankind. They have alienated themselves to the \ngreatest possible degree in the organization, so that they are no \nlonger conscious of any cleavage between personality and tech­\nnique, and do not therefore need an artificial paradise. In the case \nof the Russians, propaganda has cleverly absorbed and replaced \namusement. The Russian citizen subjected to his government’s daily \npropaganda (the most highly developed in the world) is unaware \nof anxiety. But, then, the same was true of Hitler’s Germany.\nSport. There is one last sphere where man can still frolic, but there \ntoo technique has stopped up all the gaps. I am referring to sport.\nSport has been conditioned by the organization of the great \ncities; apart from city life, its very invention is inconceivable. Coun­\ntry “sport” is but a pale imitation of city sport and has none of the \ncharacteristics of what we know as sport.\nThe sporting vocabulary is English; it was introduced to the con­\ntinent when the continental nations came under the influence of \nEnglish industrialization. After the industrial center of gravity \npassed to the United States, American sporting forms prevailed. \nThe Soviet Union began to cultivate sport when it began to indus­\ntrialize; the only country in central Europe which had organized \nsport, Czechoslovakia, was the only one which was industrialized.\nSport is tied to industry because it represents a reaction against \nindustrial life. In fact, the best athletes come from working-class \nenvironments. Peasants, woodsmen, and the like, may be more vig­\norous than the proletariat, but they are not as good athletes. In \npart, the reason for this is that machine work develops the mus­\nculature necessary for sport, which is very different from peasant \nmusculature. Machine work also develops the speed and precision \nof actions and reflexes.\nMoreover, sport is linked with the technical world because sport \nitself is a technique. The enormous contrast between the athletes \nof Greece and those of Rome is well known. For the Greeks, physi­\ncal exercise was an ethic for developing freely and harmoniously\n\f\nThe Technological Society (3 8 3\nthe form and strength of the human body. For the Romans, it was a \ntechnique for increasing the legionnaire’s efficiency. The Roman \nconception prevails today. Everyone knows the difference be­\ntween a fisherman, a sailor, a swimmer, a cyclist, and people who \nfish, sail, swim, and cycle for sport. The last are technicians; as Jun- \nger says, they “tend to carry to perfection the mechanical side of \ntheir activity.\" This mechanization of actions is accompanied \nby the mechanization of sporting goods— stop watches, starting \nmachines, and so on. In this exact measurement of time, in this \nprecision training of muscular actions, and in the principle of the \n“record,\" we find repeated in sport one of the essential elements of \nindustrial life.\nHere too the human being becomes a kind of machine, and his \nmachine-controlled activity becomes a technique. This technical \ncivilization profits by this mechanization: the individual, by \nmeans of the discipline imposed on him by sport, not only plays \nand finds relaxation from the various compulsions to which he is \nsubjected, but without knowing it trains himself for new compul­\nsions. A familiar process is repeated: real play and enjoyment, con­\ntact with air and water, improvisation and spontaneity all disap­\npear. These values are lost to the pursuit of efficiency, records, and \nstrict rules. Training in sports makes of the individual an efficient \npiece of apparatus which is henceforth unacquainted with any­\nthing but the harsh joy of exploiting his body and winning.\nThe most important thing, however, is not the education of a few \nspecialists, but the extension of the sporting mentality to the \nmasses. Insofar as this represents a vigorous reaction to the mere \npassivity of spectator sports, it is good. But the usual result is the \nintegration of more and more innocents into an insidious tech­\nnique.\nIt is needless to speak of the totalitarian frame of mind for which \nthe exercise of sports paves the way. We constantly hear that the \nvital thing is “team spirit,” and so on. It is worth noting that tech- \nnicized sport was first developed in the United States, the most \nconformist of all countries, and that it was then developed as a mat­\nter of course by the dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi, and Communist, \nto the point that it became an indispensable constituent element \nof totalitarian regimes.\nSport is an essential factor in the creation of the mass man. It is,\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES.3 8 4 }\nat the time, a disciplinary factor, and this in a twofold way. It coin­\ncides exactly with totalitarian and with technical culture. In the \n“new” countries, an interpenetration of technique and the practice \nof sport is to be observed. The authoritarian states understand and \nexploit fully the efficiency of technicized sport in making their citi­\nzens into conformists and mass men. It is one of the chief boasts of \nCommunist states that they fabricate champions in countries \nwhich hitherto had never heard the word sport. This is an effect of \nthe totalitarian society, but it also represents one of its modes of \naction. In every conceivable way sport is an extension of the tech­\nnical spirit. Its mechanisms reach into the individual’s innermost \nlife, working a transformation of his body and its motions as a func­\ntion of technique and not as a function of some traditional end \nforeign to technique, as, for example, harmony, joy, or the realiza­\ntion of a spiritual good. In sport, as elsewhere, nothing gratuitous \nis allowed to exist; everything must be useful and must come up to \ntechnical expectations.\nSport carries on without deviation the mechanical tradition of \nfurnishing relief and distraction to the worker after he has finished \nhis work proper so that he is at no time independent of one tech­\nnique or another. In sport the citizen of the technical society finds \nthe same spirit, criteria, morality, actions, and objectives— in short, \nall the technical laws and customs— which he encounters in office \nor factory.\nMedicine. Technique makes its major contribution in surgery and \nmedicine. I will consider these technical forms only briefly, first \nbecause they are far removed from the area of my own special com­\npetence, and second because they are as uncertain as they are fa­\nmiliar.\nHow can we classify these techniques? A report published in the \nreview Esprit states: “Thanks to our knowledge of psychophysio- \nlogical correlations, it is possible to claim that we are in a position \nto modify the human being's interior energetics.” These modifica­\ntions may be achieved by the following means: (1) appropriate \nnutritional regimes involving vitamins and the like; (2) suppres­\nsion of glandular secretions, as, for example, castration or steriliza­\ntion to control antisocial and overaggressive reactions; (3} injec­\ntion or grafting of hormones, as, for example, in attempts to \nincrease bodily energy, virility, femininity, or the maternal in-\n\f\nThe Tec.hnological Society (385\nstinct; (4) prolonged synthetic medication to modify metabolism; \n(S) operative interruption of the nerve paths of intracerebral \ncommunication ( to which must be added lobotomies and thala­\nmotomies, both of which involve direct intervention on the brain \nand entail a “lowering of the psychic level” ).\nWe ought to add to the above the whole pharmacopeia of “police \ndrugs,” as certain narcotics have become popularly known. These \nso-called “truth serums,” that do not extract the truth, have a bad \nreputation, and they are still limited to professional medical use. \nBecause of this, we must insist that there are extremely few au­\nthenticated instances in which sodium pentothal, for example, has \nbeen employed for other than medical reasons. Even the accounts \nof the celebrated trials in the Soviet Union and its satellites in \nwhich the defendants accused themselves must be taken with a \ngrain of salt. There is nothing to prove conclusively that truth se­\nrums were ever used, and there are good technical reasons for \nbelieving otherwise. In any case, no positive conclusions can be \nbased on such evidence as we possess. What is clear is that these \npresumed techniques, as they are represented by the press, evoke \nspectacular public reaction and inquiries. The chief reason for the \npublic’s belief in the efficacy of truth serums is probably moral \nindignation and fear brought to a pitch of madness by anti- \nCommunism, so that the real state of affairs becomes proportion­\nately harder to analyze scientifically. It is undeniable, however, \nthat it is possible to modify the human being effectively, but it is \nstill uncertain just how this modification occurs or what can ulti­\nmately be expected from such technical intervention. From my \npoint of view, these medical techniques of intervention have only \nsecondary importance. I would not deny that they represent a \nmajor intervention; they affect the human being materially and \nmodify him in far-reaching ways. Morally, such intervention is cer­\ntainly a grave matter, but the problem, after all, is not essentially \ndifferent from that posed by the death penalty.\nAs for medical technique, what is to be feared and hoped from its \napplication? And with what other technical system will this tech­\nnique be interrelated? The answer is: solely with the state. And \nthis indicates what we have to fear. It is universally understood \nthat technical means begin to be dangerous when the state begins \nto exploit them, utilizing them in connection with its arbitrary,"

When the individual undertakes to systema­\ntize a number of techniques, he seldom creates a sturdy structure. \nThe technical framework of our world is linked together naturally, \nnot by arbitrary human decision, and it is this which gives it its \nsolidity. The field of application of these medical techniques will \nof necessity be very limited, since they will be applied only to \npersons expressly designated by the state as enemies or undesir­\nables. These techniques can essentially serve only the state’s de­\nsigns— whether they are to break the spirit of the last remaining \nfree men or to eliminate the old or to obtain sensational confessions \nor declarations during a fake trial. And these designs must be \nlimited, since in the last analysis the state can have no interest in \ngeneralizing methods which appear to degrade the human being. \nThe state, on the contrary, has need of whole, strong human beings, \nin full moral, intellectual, and physical vigor, who alone can serve \nit best. What the state requires is the technical means for integrat­\ning completely whole beings, and these means are on the point of \nbecoming a reality. The technical state will not be a party to the \ndeterioration of its material. Only with regard to already useless \nmaterial (because it is refractory or weak) could the technical \nstate be driven to use one of these techniques. It is certainly not \naltogether out of the question that the state might employ these \ntechniques. But the state has many other means of attaining its \nends. Since it has at its disposal concentration camps and the death \ns e n te n c e , it would hardly go out of its way to find more compli­\ncated means, except perhaps for the sake of occasional propaganda. \nAnd certainly the population need not become so alarmed about \nwhat is, after all, only a lesser evil.\nSurgical and medical intervention have another defect from the \nstate’s point of view. They cannot be generalized, and are as a \nconsequence indeterminate except for special cases. Each new \ncase requires the state to make a special decision; these techniques \ncannot function with the autonomous regularity of such state or­\ngans as the police. Indeed, it is necessary to limit application, be­\ncause the general public must be kept in ignorance. The citizens \nare far from ready to accept the use of these techniques, and would \nbe easily aroused if they learned of it. The danger of a popular \nreaction, even a momentary one, against the state is too great to \nrisk for the limited advantages the state might draw from their use.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (387\nIt does not seem, therefore, that medical techniques are an im­\nportant part of the body of human techniques. It is possible of \ncourse to envision a time when surgery will be able to modify \nbrain structure instead of destroying it and thereby will be able \nto reconstruct a positive personality. But this is still speculative. \nMy conviction is that there is little chance of practical applica­\ntion here, apart, perhaps, from the purely medical sphere. Surgical \nintervention must be relegated to a relatively distant future. And \nwhen we consider the remarkable development of psychosociology \nand social psychoanalysis, both of which are presently being ap­\nplied on a mass scale, it is clear that with these the state can \nachieve anything it might hope to achieve through surgical modifi­\ncation of the human personality. Surgical intervention can only \nproduce “consolidating” effects. We might ask whether the game \nis worth the candle, since such intervention, when undertaken by \nthe state, confirms all our moral reservations and strictures con­\ncerning the state’s contempt for the human personality.\nThe over-all efficiency of these techniques does not allow us to \nattach any great weight to them. Their real importance, which \ncauses some disquiet, is that they are a “red herring.” Since they \nare spectacular, the public pitches upon them fearfully and crys­\ntallizes about them its diffuse fear of technique in general. But it \nis relatively easy to prove to the public that in this respect its \nfears are groundless.

The \ngreat scandal of Nazism was its indecency in applying its tech­\nniques to Otto Schultz, who had a family name and a given name, \nwho practiced his trade and led his life in full view of hundreds \nof his neighbors. He was operated on without anesthesia, dragged \noff under duress to the accompaniment of the lamentations of his \nfamily. The physicians of Struthof were scandalous because of \ntheir cynicism and brutality. It was a glaring blunder for the Nazis \nto show such complete contempt for human feelings. We do bet­\nter; we operate painlessly. Even when we use successive opera­\ntions to demonstrate the evolutionary processes of the human \nembryo, the procedures are carried out on \"volunteers,” and no \none complains very much. None of our techniques claims that it \napplies to the living.\nBecause it is first of all scientific, technique obeys the great law \nof specialization; it can be efficient only if it is specialized. In the \ncase of human beings, efficiency has a double meaning. It means \nthat technique must be applicable without raising storms of pro­\ntest. And it means that it must not neglect the scientific aspect \n(which is the most important) of this specialization. Techniques \nare designed for application to a relatively limited number of \ncases; as a consequence, general applicability cannot be envisaged. \nEvery human technique has its circumscribed sphere of action, and \nnone of them covers the whole of man. As we have seen, there are \npsychological techniques, educational techniques, and many oth­\ners. Each of these answers one and only one particular need. If \none of them is applied, it does indeed encroach on some private \nsphere or other of the individual, but the greatest part remains \nprivate. There is therefore never any clear reason to protest. This \nrelatively impersonal technical operation is a far cry from one \nwhich would hurl man brutally into a world of concentration \ncamps where the most strident, dramatic, overwhelming techniques \nsuddenly descend on him.\nA further mistake of Nazism was to dress its techniques in a \ndemoniac mask designed to inspire terror. Because the use of \nterror is also a technique, the Nazis made it an invariable accom­\npaniment of all their other techniques, shocking the rest of the\n\f\nThe Technological Society (38 9\nworld by useless excess. We do better. We dress technique in the \naseptic mask of the surgeon. Impassivity is an attribute of the new \ngod, as it was an attribute of the old. The true face of modern \ntechnique is far more like the Deist’s triangle than the grimacing \nmask of Siva.\nA single technique and its guarded application to a limited \nsphere is the starting point of dissociation. No technician anywhere \nwould say that he is submitting men, collectively or individually, \nto technique. The biogeneticist who experiments on the human \nembryo, or the film director who tries to affect his audience to the \ngreatest possible degree, makes no claim that he is working on \nman. The individual is broken into a number of independent frag­\nments, and no two techniques have the same dimensions or depth. \nNor does any combination of techniques (for example, propaganda \nplus vocational guidance) correspond to any part of the human \nbeing. The result is that every technique can assert its innocence. \nWhere, then, or by whom, is the human individual being attacked? \nNowhere and by no one. Such is the reply of technique and tech­\nnician. They ask indignantly how it can be alleged that the hu­\nman being is being attacked through the application of the new \nschool of technique. According to them, the charge itself demon­\nstrates an absence of comprehension and the presence of errone­\nous, not to say malicious, prejudices. And, in fact, every technician \ntaken separately can affirm that he is innocent of aggressive de­\nsigns against the human being. The biologist, working on a living \nembryo with the consent of the mother, is guilty of no assault on \nher life or her honor. Thus, since no technician applies his tech­\nnique to the whole man, he can wash his hands of responsibility \nand declare that the human being remains intact.\nA larger view of the technician’s operations thus presents a \ntotally reassuring and even edifying picture. Every technician \nworking on a tiny particle (so tiny it could not be considered a \nman) of living flesh can claim that he is at work in the name of a \nhigher being: Man.\nTechnicians are not very complicated beings. In truth, they are \nas simple as their techniques, which more and more assimilate \nthem. The Communists are no doubt right in thinking that all moral \nproblems will be resolved when all men have become technicians.\nIf it is an important part of the work of our “intellectuals” to\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES39 ° )\nanalyze the times and discover all the myths at work in the twen­\ntieth century, this task will demonstrate that the myths are deep- \nrooted and widespread. And when they turn their critical faculties \nto the myths of the technicians, they will not need to delve much \nor deeply. The technicians’ myth is simply Man— not you or I, but \nan abstract entity. The technician intones: “We strive for Man’s \nhappiness; we seek to create a Man of excellence. We put the \nforces of nature at his disposal in full confidence that he will over­\ncome the problems of the present,” and so on. Other modem \nmyths— for example, the myth of “progress” or of the \"proletariat” \n— are immeasurably less real to the technician than the myth of the \nabstract entity Man, in which he finds his justification. This myth, \nmoreover, represents a stage he cannot transcend, for he has small \nideology and less philosophy. He understands his methods, which \nhe applies with satisfaction because they yield immediate results. \nThe technician anticipates results, but, be it said, they are not \ngenuine ends but merely results. And then he makes the great \nleap into the unknown and finds the explanation of everything and \nthe answer to all possible objections: the myth of Man. The tech­\nnician either does not believe in the myth at all or believes in it \nonly superficially. It respresents for him a ready-made and com­\nfortable conviction, a ready answer to all criticism. It is a justifica­\ntion, but scarcely a conscious one. Why indeed should the techni­\ncian justify himself? He feels in no way guilty; his good intentions \nare as clear as their excellent results are undeniable. No. the tech­\nnician has no need of justification. And if ever the slightest doubt \nwere to penetrate his consciousness, his answer would be as clear \nas it would be staggering: The Man for whom I am working is \nHumanity, the Species, the Proletariat, the Race, Man the crea­\nture, Man the eternal, even You. All technical systems, whether \nthey be expressed in Communist or Liberal phraseology, come \nback in the final analysis to this abstraction. All technicians, too. \nThe technicians, in any case, do not have sufficient intellectual \ncuriosity to ask themselves what their favorite abstraction really \nmeans or what the relation is between this abstraction and tech­\nnique. Not, one supposes, that intellectual curiosity would be worth \nmuch here. The abstraction, Man, is only an epiphenomenon in \nthe Marxist sense; a natural secretion of technical progress.\nWhy then become agitated? We have, on the one hand, various\n\f\nThe Technological Society (391\ntechniques, each of which exerts only partial action and can there­\nfore be of no danger to man’s total being. On the other hand, we \nhave a myth, “Man,\" which more or less deifies him and in any \ncase strongly affirms that technique is subordinate to the human \nbeing. What more could we want?\nHowever, one important fact has escaped the notice of the tech­\nnicians, the phenomenon of technical convergence. Monnerot has \ndefined political totalitarianism as a convergence of a plurality of \nnational histories with a plurality of political systems. Our interest \nhere is the convergence on man of a plurality, not of techniques, \nbut of systems or complexes of techniques. The result is an opera­\ntional totalitarianism; no longer is any part of man free and in­\ndependent of these techniques. This convergence might be likened \nto the convergence of theater projectors, each of which has a spe­\ncific color, intensity, and direction, but each of which can fulfill \nits individual function only in conjunction with the others. The \neffect cannot be predicted on the basis of the individual projectors, \nonly on the basis of the object illuminated. Such is the case with \nhuman techniques. A plurality of them converge toward the hu­\nman being, and each individual technician can assert in good \nfaith that his technique leaves intact the integrity of its object. But \nthe technician’s opinion is of no importance, for the problem con­\ncerns not his technique, but the convergence of all techniques. It \nis impossible to determine, by considering any human technique in \nisolation, whether its human object remains intact or not. The \nproblem can be solved only by using the human being as a cri­\nterion, only by looking at this point of convergence of technical \nsystems. This is why I have had to make a preliminary enumeration \nof the various technical complexes which have been applied to \nmaa\nNow, two additional remarks are in order. First, as I have said \nrepeatedly, technical convergence is not brought about by the will \nof any technician or any group of technicians. No technician acts \nas conductor of the technical orchestra. Convergence is a com­\npletely spontaneous phenomenon, representing a normal stage in \nthe evolution of technique. The technicians are not conscious of \nthe mechanism and even sometimes do not approve of it. Some in­\ntellectuals have a dim awareness of the fact of convergence and \nrecognize, generally optimistically, that the technical movement\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES39 * )\nIs directed to the whole man. Some technicians are indeed seeking \ngropingly to unify a number of different techniques. Cybernetics \nand psychosomatic medicine are good examples of this, and con­\nfirm, incidentally, the phenomenon of technical convergence. At \nthe midpoint of the twentieth century we begin to become con­\nscious of the phenomenon.\nIt is difficult to exploit the techniques that already exist precisely \nbecause of the fact of technical specialization. Our highly special­\nized technicians will have a vast number of problems to hurdle \nbefore they are in a position to put together the pieces of the puz­\nzle. The technical operations involved do not appear to fit well \ntogether, and only by means of a new technique of organization \nwill it be possible to unite the different pieces into a whole. When \nthis has finally been accomplished, however, human techniques \nwill develop very fast. As yet unrecognized potentialities for in­\nfluencing the individual will appear. At the moment such possi­\nbilities are only dimly discerned in the penumbra of totalitarian \nregimes still in their infancy. It should not be forgotten, of course, \nthat, while our technicians are trying to synthesize the various \ntechniques theoretically, a synthetic unity already exists de facto, \nand man is its object.\nOur second remark concerns certain judgments we might be \ntempted to make. In discussing the effects of technique on man, \nwe must avoid overhasty or superficial generalizations. We must \nnot become too agitated or hold that man’s nature is cut into bits \nand pieces. We must be wary of using a mystical vocabulary. We \ndo not understand very well what man is, and nothing we know \nwould justify us in declaring his character sacred or some part of \nit inalienable and purely personal or in asserting that he has su­\npreme value. The values may be there, but they elude us as soon \nas we try to define them or to make precise their nature and loca­\ntion. Is this supreme value under attack? When we behold the \nindividual, trapped in technical mechanisms, we are indeed \ntempted to reply in the affirmative. But if we analyze the situation \nconcretely, we cannot discover the locus of the attack or even \nwhat is being attacked.\nFor this, another system of references is needed, a conception \nof man which is a priori and nonscientific. But then we must not \nbe surprised at the divergent reactions we get when we speak of\n\f\nThe Technological Society (393\nthe impact of techniques upon the human being. On the other \nhand, we must not say that the question is unimportant. It would \nbe deceptive to ask, “Whfat then is under attack?” and to enumerate \nanalytically the components of the human psyche, as determined \nby the most up-to-date methods, in order to show that nothing \nhumanly valuable is endangered by the progress of technique. For \nwe never know whether there is not something in man which our \nanalyses and scientific apparatus are unable to grasp. All of us, \neven the materialists, are sure that there is. For it is on the un­\nmoving and unseen axis, which is the essence of the wheel and \nround which it turns, that all else depends.\nBut we cannot declare that it is unimportant if technique per­\nmeates everything human so long as it does not reach the unreach­\nable center. This dualism is impossible because this “center” is not \nabstract but concretely embodied. If the quality of being human \ndepends on it, and if this quality is modified by the ways in which \ntechnique mauls man’s body and soul, we have no right to say \nthat what is essential remains unscathed. There is, on the contrary, \nevery evidence that what is called the “person” is being danger­\nously impaired. Similarly, it is escapism to say that what can be \nlaid hold of in man is itself the result of many influences, many \nsocial currents and collective habits, so why worry about the in­\nfluence of technique?\nI do not believe there are many proponents left of the idea that \nman is something in himself, that he has an essence independent \nof his milieu. But there is a broad middle ground between the in­\ndifference to technique affected by the philosophical dualists who \nwould maintain such a position and the indifference that the techni­\ncal sycophants affect. Two reservations suffice. First, the fact that \nthe individual is subject to a given influence is no reason to make \nhim submit to another. Second, there is a difference between the \nspontaneous and lightly coercive influence of an individualistic \nsocial group and the calculated, precise, and efficient influence of \ntechniques.\nBut here we are at the mercy of religious and scientific prejudices, \nwhich give rise to banal and superficial statements. In discussing \nthe human effects of technique, I have made every effort to avoid \npassing favorable or unfavorable judgments and to shun journal­\nistic commonplaces. My purpose is to inquire not so much into the\n\f\n3 9 4 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nmodifications of the human being that are being made as into the \nsymptoms of the technical encroachment which is now more or \nless complete.\nLet us not forget that every one of the human techniques is re­\nlated to all other techniques. We must be on guard against at­\ntempting to isolate them. When we say that human techniques \nmust compensate for the disagreeable consequences of other tech­\nniques, we are arbitrarily isolating different technical spheres. Hu­\nman techniques are closely dependent on economic, political, and \nmechanical techniques, not only because of their origin and po­\ntentialities, but even more because of the necessity for their ap­\nplication. Economics and mechanics form a framework, a milieu, \nwithin which human techniques necessarily belong. Suppressing \nthe context no doubt makes it easy to analyze these techniques and \nto draw reassuring conclusions. But the conclusions are also com­\npletely unreliable. Human techniques have no existence except to \nthe degree that the human individual is subject to economic condi­\ntions and to the degree that mechanical conditions permit the \nmeans discovered to be exercised upon him. To neglect the tech­\nnical context of these human techniques is to live in a world of \ndreams. To admit it is to perceive that human techniques in the \nreal world (not in the world of philosophic abstractions where \nfreedom is always possible) are conditioned by the economic, the \npolitical, and the mechanical. Human techniques, therefore, are \nnever “dominants” because they can exist only in relation to all the \nothers. They cannot be isolated in a pure state; and their means, \ntendencies, and results must be interpreted in relation to these \nothers. If human techniques were ever to come into conflict with \nthe others, they would inevitably lose out, for they would retain no \nreal substance. To the degree that they might conceivably run \ncounter to the necessities, for example, of economic productivity, \nthey would ruin the condition sine qua non of their application. \nWithout unremitting productivity, the men, money, and time nec­\nessary to their application would not be forthcoming. Human \ntechniques, therefore, are obliged to become a part of the techni­\ncal system; the reassuring conclusions drawn by some writers seem \ncorrespondingly less convincing.\nThe explicit problem then seems to be; If we can perceive certain\n\f\nThe Technological Society (395\nechoes of techniques in man, how do these echoes enable us to \nmeasure the degree of human technical encirclement? \nVhomme-machineA progressively more complete technical \nknowledge of man is being developed. Will it liberate him? Man’s \ntraditional, spontaneous activities are now subjected to analysis in \nall their aspects— objects, modes, durations, quantities, results. The \ntotality of these actions and feelings is then systematized, sche­\nmatized, and tabulated. A human type is created which is the only \nrecognizable “normal” As Sargent puts it “Technique will furnish \nme with norms of life in whatever concerns work, food, housing, \neducation, and so on.”\nIt is to be understood, of course, that there is no absolute obliga­\ntion for the individual to conform to the type. He can, if he will, \ndespise it. But then he will always find himself in an inferior posi­\ntion, vis-a-vis the type, whenever the two come into competition. \nOur human techniques must therefore result in the complete con­\nditioning of human behavior. They must assimilate man into the \ncomplex “man-machine,” the formula of the future.\nIn the coupling of man and machine, a genuinely new entity \ncomes into being. Most writers still insist on the modem tendency, \nwhich they profess to discern, to adapt the machine to the man. \nSuch adaptation doubtless exists and represents a great improve­\nment; but it entails its counterpart, the complete adaptation of the \nman to the machine. This last does not lie in a remote future. Man’s \nnature has already been modified; and it is to an already adapted \nindividual that technique adapts mechanical apparatus. Such \nadaptation is becoming progressively easier, and even takes place \nspontaneously when the human techniques co-operate.\nA familiar case in point is the “fixation” of workers in their work. \nPolls reveal that when a worker begins work on an assembly line, \nhe frequently experiences a certain malaise. He is simply not cut \nout for such work, and assembly-line workers are often tempted to \nabandon it or to request transfers. They become jittery and nerv­\nous, and evidence a profound uneasiness. But to make a living \nand to avoid the ever threatening unemployment, they must hold\n* Literally, \"Man: a machine,\" A famous French phrase and the title of Julien \nOffroy de la Mettrwfs celebrated work (1748) which argues the materialistic \nthesis that the soul, like the muscles, is the result of metabolism. (Trans.)\n\f\n396)  HUMAN TECHNIQUES\non to their jobs. They must force themselves to adjust to working \nconditions as they find them. They are \"fixed.” When they are \nquestioned, they claim to be satisfied and disclaim any desire for \nchange; the very idea of change, in fact, can call forth real fear. \nThe results of such polls are taken to indicate that the working \nman is happy. But a completely different interpretation is pos­\nsible: that the constant exercise of impersonal labor has resulted \nin the total depersonalization of the laborer. He has been shaped \nby his work, used by it, mechanized, and assimilated. Impartial \npsychological investigations reveal that the workers have been de­\nprived of initiative and responsibility; they are \"adapted\" to the \ndegree that they have become inert, unable to take risks in any \narea. Such findings do not, perhaps, apply to all workers, but \nthey represent the current tendency. They are, moreover, readily \nunderstandable. W hy should we demand that workers be super­\nmen? Workers, like all other men in the technical society, have \nacquired a fear of change, and feel the need of the work that costs \nthem so much. Their situation is analogous to that of the man who \nbegan by reacting to propaganda, progressively abandoned him­\nself to it, ended by being manipulated by it, and is no longer \ncapable of dispensing with this adjuvant to personality and excit­\nant to thought and feeling.\nUntil recently it was possible to show that worker adaptation to \na given machine did not represent excessive specialization in the \nimportant sense that the specialized worker could be adapted to a \nvery great number of different machines. This statement is still \nperhaps true for the period we are passing through today. But the \nmore monumental and exacting the machine becomes (and by \nmachine T  understand organization, too), the more indissoluble \nthe complex man-machine becomes. The difficulty experienced by \npilots of hypermodem aircraft in changing over to another type of \nmachine, or even to another machine of the same type, is well \nknown. This last seems a good example of the irreversible condi­\ntioning of the individual by technique. The more human factors \nare taken into account in the development of technique, the more \nman himself is a part of the development, not perhaps in a subordi­\nnate role, but irreversibly and indissolubly superordinated. But \nsuch superordination, even if we take it in its most favorable light, \ncan scarcely represent human liberation; the human being be-"

Man and technique bear the same relation to each other \nas the social superstructure bears to the economic infrastructure \nin the Marxist scheme of things. Technicized man literally no \nlonger exists except in relation to the technical infrastructure.\nThe theory might be advanced that in the man-machine complex \nman in some sense plays the role the soul plays in relation to the \nbody in certain philosophies. But the contrary would rather seem \nthe case, as J. M. Lahy implied long ago when he asked: \"Will not \nthis man have less and less time to be conscious of his own living \npresence?” No doubt, man will continue to steer the machine, but \nonly at the price of his individuality.\nAgain the adaptability of man will be raised as an objection to \nmy thesis. Why should not man be able to adapt to the technical \ncontext, since he has in the past adapted to so many new situations \nand to so many different conditions equally representative of pro­\nfound change? Why should he forfeit his personal life now, after \nhe has for so long been able to take new conditions in stride with­\nout forfeiting it? Technical adaptation will doubtless produce anew \nhuman type, but why should this be condemned? My reply to this \ntheory (which has enjoyed great vogue in the past few years) is \nthat man does indeed possess an extraordinary adaptive capacity, \nbut this adaptability has produced very varied results. Some natives \nof Tierra del Fuego have succeeded in adapting to life on Cape \nHorn; but it can hardly be maintained that they represent a very \ndesirable human type. I entertain no doubts whatsoever that a \ngeneralized human adaptability exists, but I am much less certain \nof the excellence of its results in what concerns men in the con­\ncrete. I must add that I am much more interested in real men \nwho actually exist than in that ideal Man which has no existence \nexcept as an image and an abstraction.\nThe ideal Man is an escapism which eases every kind of \nenormity with tranquilizing abstractions. We should remember \nwhat the Nazis did with respect to this ideal in their extermination \ncamps (which destroyed some millions of unimportant specimens). \nWe ought to avoid the same mistake with respect to this all-virtuous \nideal in the universal concentration camp we live in. What is im­\nportant is not the adaptability of Man, but the adaptability of \nmen. We shall find the answer, not in the immortal soul of the\n\f\n3g8 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nSpecies, but in the preservation of our own individual souls, which \nare, perhaps, not immortal.\nOur personal adaptability is limited. There are circumstances in \nwhich men as we know them cannot live at all. They cannot live, \nfor example, in concentration camps, even when these exist without \nsupplementary tortures. There are conditions in which they can \nindeed continue to exist, but only with the loss of everything which \nmakes them peculiarly human. In this connection we have only \nto think of certain tribes terrifyingly close to the animal level (and, \nin some aspects of life, even below it). We need only think of the \nNazi torture apparatus, or of the degradation experienced by the \nordinary man in the ranks of the army in wartime. In view of these \nexamples, we are entitled to ask what adaptation will really be like \nin the man-machine complex. The psychotechnicians have recog­\nnized that adaptation is not possible for everyone. In a completely \ntechnicized world, there will be whole categories of men who will \nhave no place at all, because universal adaptation will be required. \nThose who are adaptable will be so rigorously adapted that no \nplay in the complex will be possible. The complete joining of man \nand machine will have the advantage, however, of making the \nadaptation painless. And it will assure the technical efficiency of \nthe individuals who survive it.\nUp to the present, adaptation has been the product of material \ninteraction, with all this implies in laxness, misfitting, and excess. \nBut future adaptation will be calculated according to a strict sys­\ntem, the so-called “biocracy.” It will be impossible to escape this \nsystem of adaptation because it will be articulated with so much \nscientific understanding of the human being. The individual will \nhave no more need of conscience and virtue; his moral and mental \nfurnishings will be a matter of the biocrat’s decisions.\nAt present we have little conception of what this new man will \nbe like. The technician by his existence gives us an inkling, but an \nimperfect one; the technician still retains elements of spontaneity. \nWe are, however, able to divine what the new man will gain and \nwhat he will lose in comparison with the average modem man.\nThe Dissociation of Man. A  second element, which is of great im­\nportance (and is, in a way, the inverse of the last), is the human \ndissociation produced by techniques.

But the unity produced is the abstract unity of \nthe ideal Man; in reality, the concrete application of techniques dis­\nsociates man into fragments. We have already considered the dis­\nsociation of human intelligence and action characteristic of modem \nmethods of work. The same tendency is found in “shift” work. It \nis understood, of course, that in modem work the human being \naccomplishes nothing; at best he performs a neutral function dur­\ning the “dead time” of the working day. He must exercise his \nown personality, if he exercises it at all, during the eight hours of \nleisure.\nThis tendency gives \"good results” in the form of contented \nworkers. But in another sense it is exceedingly dangerous. It is im­\npossible to make industrial labor interesting by allowing the worker \nto introduce his own personality into it. He must be rendered com­\npletely unconscious and mechanized in such a way that he cannot \neven dream of asserting himself. The technical problem is to make \nhis gestures so automatic that they have no personal quality at all.\nWhat we usually say is: “The worker must be freed from con­\ntinual preoccupation with the tasks of his vocation.” I can easily \nsee the good results of this liberation. But to call good the fact \nthat the worker thinks and dreams about matters unrelated to his \nwork while his body carries out certain mechanical activities is to \nsanction the psychological dissociation between intelligence and \naction which our technical society tends to produce and which is ' \npossibly the greatest of human scourges. We thereby admit that, \nwhen all is said and done, the ideal state, higher than conscious­\nness, is a dreaming sleep.\nTo acquiesce in the thesis that work is “neutral” is to acquiesce \nin this profound rupture. Indeed, the individual cannot be “ab­\nsent” from his work without great injury to himself. Work is an \nexpression of life. To assert that the individual expresses his per­\nsonality and cultivates himself in the course of his leisure (we hive \nalready considered what may be expected of mans leisure) is to \naccept the suppression of half the human personality. History com­\npels the judgment that it is in work that human beings develop and \na£Brm  their personality. Those who set an inordinately high value \non sports and gambling are without substance. Only see what \nleisure has made of the bourgeois classes of society!\nIt is possible that the modem organization of industrial society\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES400)\nhas made people \"happy.1 *  The dissociation of mental activity from \nphysical actions probably results in a lessening of fatigue since \nthere is no longer any need to participate or to make decisions. It \nis nonetheless undesirable to sanction this situation or to establish \nit as the norm. To do so is inevitably to weaken the human per­\nsonality; it is impossible so to fragment man’s personality without \nweakening it A certain disequilibration may be avoided by these \nmeans. But the loss of creative power has disastrous psychological \nconsequences.-When the human being is no longer responsible for \nhis work and no longer figures in it, he feels spiritually outraged. \nThe technical organization of the technical society may obviate \ncertain tendencies to aggression and frustration (in a non-Freudian \nsense). But the annihilation of work and its compensation with \nleisure resolves the conflicts by referring them to a subhuman \nplane.\nIt is difficult to understand the hope many modem men repose \nin leisure. Yet this hope is prevalent. It is, for example, the point \nof departure of Christian employers1 who hold that in his leisure \ntime the worker can lead a personal life, escape the constraints put \nupon him by society, and regain his psychic equilibrium. This is \nalso the attitude of the socialists, who advocate the greatest possible \nreduction of working hours in order that the individual be afforded \ncertain possibilities of life and self-development. It is the attitude \nof the technicians of labor, as reported by Friedmann. In com­\nmenting on certain essays of Leon Walther, Friedmann writes: \n\"We must conjure up the prospect of a society in which labor will \nbe of restricted duration, industrial operations automatized, and \npiecework, requiring no attention, made pleasant by music and lec­\ntures . . .  a society, in short, in which culture will be identified \ncompletely with leisure. In a leisure more and more full of po­\ntentialities, and more and more active, will be found the justifica­\ntion of the humanistic experiment.”\nFriedmann is asserting here that it is impossible to make indus­\ntrial labor positive. But if we agree to Friedmann’s proposition \nthat the human being can develop his personality only in the \ncultivation of leisure, we are denying that work is an element of\n1 See Rapport sur le travail au Cornell (EcttmSnique (1948).\n\f\nThe Technologies Society (401\npersonality fulfillment, or of satisfaction, or of happiness. This is \nbad enough; but the situation is even more serious when we con­\nsider that putting our hopes in leisure is really taking refuge in \nidealism. If leisure were a real vacuum, a break with the forces of \nthe environment, and if, moreover, it were spontaneously utilized \nfor the education of the personality, the thesis of the value of \nleisure might hold. But neither of these conditions is true.\nW e see first of all that leisure, instead of being a vacuum rep­\nresenting a break with society, is literally stuffed with technical \nmechanisms of compensation and integration. It is not a vacuous \ninterval. It is not a human kind of emptiness in which decisions \nmight be matured. Leisure time is a mechanized time and is ex­\nploited by techniques which, although different from those of \nman’s ordinary work, are as invasive, exacting, and leave man no \nmore free than labor itself. As to the second condition, it is simply \nnot the case that the individual, left on his own, will devote him­\nself to the education of his personality or to a spiritual and cultural \nlife. We are perpetually falling into this idealism. In fact, modern \nman himself seeks to give a technical form to his leisure time and \nrebels against entering the sphere of human creativity. Since his \nyouth, and in his vocational activity, he has been unrelentingly \n“adapted.” If the individual must be regimented into intelligent \nuse of his free time, if he is obliged to spend this time learning \nhow to be “human,” of what value are vacations and leisure? Where \nin this new framework of propaganda is there room for the tran- \nscendingly important elements of personality formation, choice, \npersonal experience, and spontaneous participation in creative ac­\ntivity? Who or what is to be his guide in the collective, educative \nemployment of leisure? The employer? the administration? the \nlabor unions? To put the question at all is to recognize its fatuity. \nWhat if man’s leisure allowed him to judge his own work? What if, \nin becoming “cultivated” or, even better, “a real person,” he should \nrebel against his stupid, mechanized job? Or find his four hours of \nobligatory servitude an intolerable abasement? It is unimaginable.\nW e conclude that the education of the human personality can­\nnot but conform to the postulates of technical civilization. Man’s \nleisure must reinforce the other elements of this culture so there \nwill be no risk of producing poorly adjusted persons. This is the\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES4 0 2 )\ndirection the techniques of amusement have taken. To gamble that \nleisure will enable man to live is to sanction the dissociation I have \nbeen describing and to cut him off completely from a part of life.\nHistorically it has always been possible for men to realize them­\nselves in their free time. The individual has always found self- \nexpression both in work and in leisure; the two exist in a mutual \nrelationship and express two consubstantial aspects of the human \nbeing. It is idealistic to expect leisure to replace the functions of \nboth work and leisure or to epitomize and take upon itself the whole \nof life. A minimum condition would be that automatic work, the \ntravail neant, be of very limited duration, perhaps three or four \nhours daily. But such a reduction of working hours is still a long \nway off. And even if we could be certain that this would come to \npass in two or three generations, might not the human being have \nbeen so transformed by that time that his spontaneous creative \npower would have been irreparably destroyed? It would be utterly \nidealistic to reply in the negative. And it would be twice-com­\npounded idealism to believe that the individual with fourteen \nhours of leisure free of technique and of necessity, would spon­\ntaneously produce works expressing his personality.\nThere are people who have hobbies such as gardening or putter­\ning about the house. But what is the proportion of such people to \nthose who do nothing? The melancholy fact is that the human \npersonality has been almost wholly disassociated and dissolved \nthrough mechanization.\nAll this shows once again how illusory it is to pin to one sector of \ntechnique the hopes which serious analysis denies all of them. We \nmust conclude that the organizers of work, who have clearly recog­\nnized the nature of modem labor, have failed to recognize the \nnature of leisure. If it is asked whether leisure could be otherwise, \nthe answer is that it could. So could the conditions of work. And \nthe state and human nature. But if we are going in for all these \nconditionals, paradise could also find a place on earth.\nThe Triumph of the Unconscious. Flight is always possible. It is, \nindeed, the spontaneously chosen solution (moreover, it represents \nstill another aspect of the technical encirclement of the person). If \nthere cannot be any real salvation, the individual escapes into il­\nlusion and unconsciousness. Modem man (I do not speak of the \ntheoreticians) represses his fear of the technical world and intoxi-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (403\ncates himself with action, or, better, with the illusion of action. One \nof the most genuine men of our time, Georges Navel, is a living \nwitness to (he possibility of true freedom even in a technical world. \nBut Navel has had to pay a fearful price for this freedom in effort, \nasceticism, and refusal to compromise. And even Navel is not com­\npletely free of the illusion of action, as shown by his recommenda­\ntion of “political participation” as one means of curing the world’s \nmalaise.\nThe individual who engages in party politics, with its program \nof activities, meetings, and fellowship, may well discover in it an \nanswer to the problems of disequilibration. Indeed, the more de­\nmanding the party, the more efficacious the remedy. Communism \nlong ago denounced the political activity of the democracies as an \nintolerable hoax and a “flight into unreality.” For them, democratic \npolitical \"action” is completely useless. I will not go into Marx’s \nanalysis of democracy, which I hold to be true. But everything \nMarx has to say about democratic political action seems to me to \nhold, feature for feature, for Communist politics as well. The in­\ndividual who throws himself into political activity of any coloration \nhas the gratifying impression that he is accomplishing something, \nand justification and satisfaction. But the sad truth is that he is \nresolutely by-passing the real problem and repressing it. This kind \nof compensation, which is natural and easily understandable, can \nnonetheless only result in human disintegration and a new techni­\ncal alienation. A  detailed consideration of political activity would \nbring us back once more to the same point. Political activity allows \nthe human being to exist in the technical milieu, but it is regression \nnonetheless, and a corollary to the general flight into unconscious­\nness.\nBut this is true of work and, in fact, of all elements of human life. \nAll of them, to the extent that they are encircled and repressed by \ntechnique, tend to pass over the lower threshold of consciousness. \nThe unconscious tends, therefore, to play an ever more important \nrole in the conduct of human life.\nEvery technique, and above all every human technique, makes \na fundamental appeal to the unconscious. At the same time the \nsphere of action of the unconscious is enlarged by means of the \nrepressions I have mentioned. It is highly significant that technical \nelements begin to appear in what the psychoanalysts call the\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES404)\n“great dreams.” The traditional figures of certain typical dreams, \nfigures which go back to the remotest human times, are beginning \nto be displaced by technical instruments. Bastide notes the appear­\nance of the automobile in the dreams of certain Indian tribes. The \nimportant point here is that a technical contrivance has replaced \ntraditional symbols; the breakdown of an automobile, it would \nseem, is symbolic of sexual derangement. This mechanical pene­\ntration of the unconscious indicates that nothing human is exempt \nfrom the influence of technique.\nIn art, technical influence has been marked. Indeed, modern art \nexpresses the subconscious precisely to the degree that the sub­\nconscious has been influenced by the machine. The artist is in fact \na seismograph that records the fluctuations of man and society. \nThe cubist and abstract schools of art ( as, in poetry, dadaism and \noneirism) are aspects of this deep reality. With very different \nforms, Chirico, Leger, and Marcel Duchamp, sometimes con­\nsciously and sometimes unconsciously, show us the coupling of \nmachine and person. They show too the absurdity of the mechani­\ncal world, however rational it may be, and the impossibility of an \naesthetic based on the technical movement unless it is an aesthetic \nof madness. A  major section of modern art and poetry uncon­\nsciously guides us in the direction of madness; and, indeed, for the \nmodern man there is no other way. Only madness is inaccessible to \nthe machine. Every other “art\" form can be reduced to technique; \nnote the utilitarian art of the Soviets. The artists of our time are the \nmost impressive witnesses to the fact that a true aesthetics is an \nimpossibility for men whose only alternatives are madness or pure \ntechnique; and this in spite of the existence of powers of artistic \ninvention such as past civilizations have seldom seen.\nAs long as modern art was concerned with an aesthetic of move­\nment (as opposed to the older aesthetic of form), with the inte­\ngration of duration into graphic representation, with the “simul­\ntaneity” of Miro, Picasso, and Klee, an artistic world capable of \ndevelopment was still possible. But although the artist of the \npresent can still master and represent the impulse of the machine, \nhe is completely overwhelmed and impotent in a world that has a \nplace only for a human being who has been stripped of his real self. \nContemporary art forms bear witness to this impotence.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (4 0 5\nWe must pay due respect to the honorable struggle being waged \nby those who wish to deliver men from the clutches of technique \nand restore certain possibilities of living to man. If I have criticized \ntheir research on work and leisure, I did so not because I object to \ntheir aims but because I distrust their illusions and idealism.\nIf we take note of the penetration of technique into the un­\nconscious, we must also consider the inverse, the exploitation of \nthis penetration by other techniques with the purpose of reinforc­\ning it and making it more complete. I have indicated that propa­\nganda is based on the manipulation of the subconscious by \ntechnical means. So are those hypermodem police methods which \nhave as their end the establishment of a “neurotic complex” based \non feelings of insecurity. Our technical world not only creates these \nfeelings spontaneously, it develops them with malice aforethought \nfor technical reasons and by technical means which, in their action \non the human being, reinforce the structures of that technical \nworld. “The only person who still remains a private individual is \nhe who is asleep,” declared Robert Ley in a noteworthy phrase. \nThe words might be taken to refer exclusively to the Nazi regime. \nBut they are not limited. They pertain to the integration of all \nmen into a brutally technicized environment.\nLey’s aphorism, however, is not altogether exact, for we have \nobserved the intrusion of technique even into dreams. This phe­\nnomenon has been given a Freudian interpretation in terms of the \n“superego,” which lays hold of the thoughts and feelings of every \nindividual. This concept of the superego, which is composed of the \ncollective imperative and mass assimilation, brings us to a new \nseries of observations centering about the “mass man.”\nMass Man.

If these techniques \nstrengthen him in his nineteenth-century individualism (itself no \nideal state of affairs), they only aggravate the split between the \nmaterial structures of society, the social institutions, and the forces \nof production, on the one hand, and man's personal tendencies, on \nthe other.

Moreover, \nthese techniques remain at variance with the other material tech­\nniques on which they depend. They must contribute to making \nman a mass man and help put an end to what has hitherto been \nconsidered the normal type of humanity. The type that will emerge \nand the type that will disappear will be the subjects of a forth­\ncoming work. For the moment, it suffices to establish concretely \nthe tendencies of our human techniques to create the mass man.\nMaterial techniques usually result in a collective social form by \nmeans of a process which is largely involuntary. But it is sometimes \nvoluntary; the technician, in agreement with the technical data, \nmay consider a collectivity a higher social form. Involuntary and \nvoluntary action are both to be observed, for example, in the sphere \nof psychological collectivization. I have indicated (for example, in \nmy treatment of leisure) the means by which this involuntary and, \nin a way, automatic adaptation appears. I shall refer to one other \nstriking phenomenon of involuntary psychological collectivization; \nadvertising.\nThe primary purpose of advertising technique is the creation of a \ncertain way of life. And here it is much less important to convince \nthe individual rationally than to implant in him a certain concep­\ntion of life. The object offered for sale by the advertiser is naturally \nindispensable to the realization of this way of life. Now, objects \nadvertised are all the result of the same technical progress and are \nall of identical type from a cultural point of view. Therefore, ad­\nvertisements seeking to prove that these objects are indispensable \nrefer to the same conception of the world, man, progress, ideals—  \nin short, life. Once again we are confronted by a technical phe­\nnomenon completely indifferent to all local and accidental dif­\nferences. Indeed, American. Soviet, and Nazi advertisements are \nin inspiration closely akin; they express the same conception of life, \ndespite all superficial differences of doctrine. The Soviet Union, \nafter having for a period violently rejected the technical system of \nadvertising publicity, has more recently found it indispensable.\nAdvertising, which is founded on massive psychological research \nthat must be effective, can “put across” the technical way of life. \nAny man who buys a given object participates in this way of life \nand, by falling prey to the compulsive power of advertising, enters\n\f\nThe T echnological Society (407\ninvoluntarily and unconsciously into its psychological framework.\nOne of the great designs of advertising is to create needs; but this \nis possible only if these needs correspond to an ideal of life that \nman accepts. The way of life offered by advertising is all the more \ncompelling in that it corresponds to certain easy and simple tend­\nencies of man and refers to a world in which there are no spiritual \nvalues to form and inform life. When men feel and respond to the \nneeds advertising creates, they are adhering to its ideal of life. This \nexplains the extremely rapid development, for example, of hygiene \nand cocktails. No one, before the advent of advertising, felt the \nneed to be clean for cleanliness’ sake. It is clear that the models \nused in advertising (Elsie the Cow, for instance) represent an ideal \ntype, and they are convincing in proportion to their ideality. The \nhuman tendencies upon which advertising like this is based may be \nstrikingly simple-minded, but they nonetheless represent pretty \nmuch the level of our modem life. Advertising offers us the ideal \nwe have always wanted (and that ideal is certainly not a heroic \nway of life).\nAdvertising goes about its task of creating a psychological col­\nlectivism by mobilizing certain human tendencies in order to intro­\nduce the individual into the world of technique. Advertising also \ncarries these tendencies to the ideal, absolute limit It accomplishes \nthis by playing down all other human tendencies. Every man is \nconcerned, for example, about his bodily health— but show him \nSuperman and it becomes his destiny to be Superman. In addition, \nadvertising offers man the means for realizing material desires \nwhich hitherto had the tiresome propensity of not being realized \nIn these three ways, psychological collectivism is brought into \nbeing.\nAdvertising must affect all people; or at least an overwhelming \nmajority. Its goal is to persuade the masses to buy. It is therefore \nnecessary to base advertising on general psychological laws, which \nmust then be unilaterally developed by it. The inevitable conse­\nquence is the creation of the mass man. As advertising of the most \nvaried products is concentrated, a new type of human being, pre­\ncise and generalized, emerges. We can get a general impression \nof this new human type by studying America, where human beings \ntend clearly to become identified with the ideal of advertising. In\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES408)\nAmerica advertising enjoys universal popular adherence, and the \nAmerican way of life is fashioned by it\nIn addition to the involuntary, psychological activity which leads \nto the creation of the mass man, there are certain conscious means \nwhich can be used to attain the same end. We must not misunder­\nstand the qualification conscious in this connection. The degree of \nchoice is very small; the process is effectively conditioned by ma­\nterial techniques and the beliefs they engender. However, this \nconsciously concerted action is geared to psychological collectivi­\nzation and, unlike advertising techniques, exerts a direct effect. It \nhas a twofold basis and a twofold orientation, and centers about \nthe notions of group integration and unanimity, which I shall dis­\ncuss in the following section.\nUp to now, in discussing human techniques we have considered \nonly man’s need for adaptation with a view to his happiness or, at \nleast, his equilibrium. This plays a role here too. For example, it \ncan be shown that in our society the individual experiences tran­\nquility only in a consciously gregarious state. This involves not only \nthe indeniable “strength in unity” and “forgetfulness of one’s lot \nin the crowd,\" but also the conscious recognition of the need to \napply adequate remedies to social dangers. In our culture, the per­\nson who is not consciously adapted to his group cannot put up \nadequate resistance. Lewin’s studies of anti-Semitism, for example, \nindicate that the Zionist groups with their collective psychology \nwere able to withstand persecution much more readily than were \nthe unorganized Jews who had retained an individualistic men­\ntality.\nIt cannot be denied that this kind of conscious psychological \nadaptation, which gives the individual a chance to survive and \neven be happy, can produce beneficial effects. Though he loses \nmuch personal responsibility, he gains as compensation a spirit of \nco-operation and a certain self-respect in his relations with other \nmembers of the group. These are eminently c< 1 ctivist virtues, but \nthey are not negligible, and they assure the individual a certain \nhuman dignity in the collectivity of mass men.\nWhile I have insisted on the “humanistic” tendencies of human \ntechniques and, starting from the premise that man must be \nadapted to be happy, have tried to demonstrate the necessity of\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 409\nthese techniques and their interrelation with all other techniques, \nmy attitude has been resolutely optimistic. I have presupposed \nthat technical practices and the intentions of the technicians wer$ \nsubordinated to a concern with human good. And when I traced \nthe background of the human techniques, I proceeded from the \nmost favorable position, that of integral humanism, which, it is \nclaimed, is their foundation.\nBut there are more compelling realities. The tendency towardpsy- \nchological collectivization does not have man’s welfare as its end. \nIt is designed just as well for his exploitation. In today’s world, \npsychological collectivization is the sine qua non of technical ac­\ntion. Munson says: “By building the morale of the troops, we are \ntrying to increase their yield, to substitute enthusiastic self-disci­\npline for forced obedience, to stimulate their will and their attention \n— in short, we are pursuing success.” There he gives us the key to \nthis kind of psychological action: the yield is greater when man \nacts from consent, rather than constraint. The problem then is to \nget the individual’s consent artificially through depth psychology, \nsince he will not give it of his own free will. But the decision to \ngive consent must appear to be spontaneous. Anyone who prates \nabout furnishing man an ideal or a faith to live by is helping to \nbring about technique’s ascendency, however much he talks about \n“good will.\" The “ideal” becomes so through the agency of purely \ntechnical means whose purpose is to enable men to support an in­\nsupportable situation created within the framework of technical \nculture. This attitude is not the antithesis of the humanistic atti­\ntude; the two are interwoven and it is completely artificial to try to \nseparate them.\nHuman activity in the technical milieu must correspond to this \nmilieu and also must be collective. It must belong to the order of \nthe conditioned reflex. Complete human discipline must respond to \ntechnical necessity. And as the technical milieu concerns all men, \nno mere handful of them but the totality of society is to be con­\nditioned in this way. The reflex must be a collective one. As Munson \nsavs: “In peacetime, morale building aims at creating among the \ntroops that state of mental receptivity which makes them sus­\nceptible to every psychological excitation of wartime.” And this \n“receptivity” must also be instilled in every other human group in \nthe technical culture, and especially in the masses of the workers.\n\f\n4 10  ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES\nPsychological conditioning presupposes collectivity, for masses \nof men are more receptive to suggestion than individuals, and, as \nwe have seen, suggestion is one of the most important weapons in \nthe psychological arsenal. At the same time, the masses are intoler­\nant and think everything must be black or white. This results from \nthe moral categories imposed by technique and is possible only \nif the masses are of a single mind and if countercurrents are not \npermitted to form.\nThe conditions for psychological efficiency are, first, group inte­\ngration and, second, group unanimity. (This should not be taken \nto mean that on a larger scale there may not be a certain diversity.) \nI am speaking of a determinate group (for example, a political \nparty, the army, an industrial plant) which has a definite technical \nfunction to fulfill. The purpose of psychological methods is to \nneutralize or eliminate aberrant individuals and tendencies to \nfractionation. Simultaneously, the tendency to collectivization is \nreinforced in order to “immunize” the environment against any \npossible virus of disagreement.\nWhen psychological techniques, in close co-operation with ma­\nterial techniques, have at last succeeded in creating unity, all pos­\nsible diversity will have disappeared and the human race will have \nbecome a bloc of complete and irrational solidarity.\nTotal Integration\nUntil recently, we were obliged to think of man as divided in his \nrelation to the technical world. One part of him was given over \ncompletely to the monster and subjected to the interior and ex­\nterior rules; but the other part he could keep for himself: his inner \nlife, his family life, his psychic life. He suffered from this division, \nbut nonetheless he retained a very considerable measure of free­\ndom. (When he insisted on retaining too much, he was said to be \nsuffering from a proportionate lack of social adaptation.) Many \nmore aspects of the human personality have been exposed to the \ntechnical society, and today very nearly the entire human race is \nexperiencing this progressive cleavage of personality. The average \nman, with his sentimental and intellectual attachments to the past, i\n\f\nThe Technological Society (411\nsuffers acutely. Rare are the men who have so completely re­\nnounced the inner life as to hurl themselves gladly and without \nregret into a completely technicized mode of being. Such persons \nmay exist, but it is probable that the \"joyous robot” has not yet \nbeen bom.\nI have repeated time and again that this tension, this dichotomy, is \nharder and harder to bear and begins to appear more and more \nbaneful in its influence even to the psychologists, sociologists, and \nteachers, that is, to the psychotechnicians in general. They want to \nrestore man’s lost unity, and patch together that which technical \nadvances have separated. But only one way to accomplish this ever \noccurs to them, and that is to use technical means. Since the \nhuman sciences are applications of technical means, this entails \nrounding up those elements of the human personality that are \nstill free and forcing (“reintegrating” ) them into the expanding \ntechnical order of things. What yet remains of private life must be \nforced into line by invisible techniques, which are also implacable \nbecause they are derived from personal conviction. Reintegration \ninvolves man’s covert spiritual activities as well as his overt actions. \nAmusements, friendship, art—all must be compelled toward the \nnew integration, thanks to which there is to be no more social \nmaladjustment or neurosis. Man is to be smoothed out, like a pair \nof pants under a steam iron.\nThere is no other way to regroup the elements of the human \npersonality: the human being must be completely subjected to an \nomnipotent technique, and all his acts and thoughts must be the \nobject of the human techniques. Those men, undoubtedly \"men of \ngood will,” who are so preoccupied with the technical restoration \nof man’s lost unity certainly have not willed things as they have \nturned out. Their error lies much more in not having clearly seen \ngenuine alternatives. The conscientious psychologist, sympathetic \nthough he may be to human suffering, does not even consider al­\nternative solutions to the problem. For him, technique imposes a \ntechnical solution. And this solution indeed restores unity to the \nhuman being, but only by virtue of the total integration of man \ninto the process which originally produced his dismemberment. \nThe psychologist sees this dismemberment (and civilization’s neu­\nroses, too) as symptomatic of the incompleteness of the absorptive \nprocess. To achieve unity, then, means to complete the process.\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES41a)\nTechnical Anesthesia. It seems odd that the application of a tech* \nnique designed to liberate men from the machine should end in \nsubjecting them the more harshly to it. But given the technological \nstate of mind, the paradox is easily explained. Consider a worker \nwho is subject to a machine and its caprices. He must follow the \nmachine’s tempo and breathe its waste products. At the same time, \nhe must fight off fatigue and boredom. In short, he must perform \nthe work of two men. The efficiency expert comes and institutes \nprocedures to automate actions and save energy by transforming \neverything into mechanical reflexes. But the psychologist is dead \nset against this; he finds insupportable the total subjection of the \nworker to the machine which the efficiency expert has elabo­\nrated, and he proposes to liberate him. To accomplish this laudable \nend, the psychologist in turn elaborates a science of human be­\nhavior with its own laws of human psychology; for example, laws \nconcerning worker fatigue, and so on. He draws up a program not \nmerely of the worker's actions in the factory, but of his whole life. \nThe human being ends by being encased in an even broader tech­\nnical framework. It will doubtless make life easier and enable him \nto work with a minimum of effort, but only on condition that he \nfollow its rules to the letter. The example is a simple one, but it \ncan be found in every sphere of human activity, wherever the \npsychotechnician has felt himself called upon to ‘‘liberate’  man­\nkind. Progress must obviously be paid for by even harsher subjec­\ntion to the instrument of salvation. The worker is in the same \nsituation as the invalid racked by pain who receives an anodyne \nnarcotic which makes him an addict— the addiction persists even \nafter he has been ‘‘cured.’  In much the same way, a nation that has \nbeen subjected to a totalitarian propaganda barrage is unable to \nget its bearings in a direct and natural way after the barrage has \nceased; the psychic trauma was too profound. The sole means of \nliberating people from ‘‘ideas’  so inculcated is through another \npropaganda campaign at least as intense as the first. But the new \npropaganda only subjects them to a psychic pressure that kills a \nlittle more of their freedom.\nConsider an inquisitorial and brutal police force that operates \nas it pleases and carries out arrests arbitrarily. No citizen has any \npeace of mind. Yet the only remedy so far devised for the disease \nis the establishment of the hypermodern system of dossiers. Every\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 4 13\ncitizen is kept track of throughout his life, geographically, bio­\nlogically, and economically; the police know precisely what he is \nup to at every moment. This police system no longer needs to he \nbrutal, openly inquisitorial, or omnipresent to the public con­\nsciousness. But it permeates all of life, in a way the average citizen \nfinds it impossible to understand. Just what has been gained? Ad­\nmittedly, man need no longer be apprehensive at work, or live per­\npetually under suspicion, or be afraid of being subjected to the \n“third degree.\" The terror which until now has been an integral \npart of the police methods of totalitarian states is, or soon will be, \na thing of the past. The “terror over the city,\" perfectly described \nby Cerrado Alvaro, is only a transitory stage. A diffuse terror usu­\nally follows open police raids and public executions. At this stage \nthe police may be invisible, but they lurk in the shadows. One \nhears tales of secret executions in the soundproof cellars of vast, \nmysterious buildings. At a still more advanced stage of police \ntechnique, even this diffuse terror gradually dissipates. The police \nexist only to protect “good citizens.\" They no longer carry out \nraids and there is nothing mysterious about them; therefore they \nare not felt to be oppressive. Police work has become “scientific.* \nTheir files contain dossiers of every citizen. The police are in a \nposition to lay hands on anyone “wanted\" at any moment, and this \nobviates to a great degree the necessity of doing so. No one can \nevade the police or disappear. But, then, no one wants to. An \nelectronic dossier is not particularly fearsome.\nHere we have the essence of the techniques of “humanization\": to \nrender unnoticeable the disadvantages that other techniques have \ncreated. The task of the technician is to develop machine tech­\nniques and human techniques to such a pitch of perfection that \neven the man face to face with the perfectly functioning machine \nno longer has human initiative or the desire to escape. In a simple \nmachine, a sticking gear or an overheated rod calls the existence \nof the machine to the notice of its vexed user. A lubricating \ntechnique is needed which will make the machine function so \nsmoothly that its presence is not felt The ability to forget the ma­\nchine is the ideal of technical perfection. In the “man-machine\" \ncomplex, friction results from the collision between the human \nbeing and the organization. This friction can take a number of \nforms. Individual initiative may become irritated by some obvious\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES\nmechanical failure; die individual may insist on operating the ma­\nchine in a manner not provided for in the rules of automatism. \nThe problem then is twofold: to perfect mechanical techniques, on \nthe one hand, and to invent and impose certain human techniques, \non the other, so as to obviate the human sources of friction. As \nLatil has pointed out, self-guiding techniques that operate with­\nout any external interference are possible. This has been demon­\nstrated by machines that are autonomous, have a memory, and \nanticipate future events. Skeptics of the kind who denied a priori \nthe possibility of heavier-than-air machines will deride this as \nmere imagination. It is true that such machines have not yet been \nperfected, but even an approximation in this direction would suf­\nfice for our argument\nThe technical society must perfect the “man-machine” complex \nor risk total collapse. Is there any other way out? I am convinced \nthat there is. Unfortunately, I am also compelled to note that \nneither the scientists nor the technicians want any part of any other \nsolution. And since I work with realities and not with abstractions, \nI recognize the inevitability of the fact that technical difficulties de­\nmand technical solutions. All the troubles provoked by the en­\ncounter between man and technique are of a technical order, and \ntherefore no one dreams of applying nontechnical remedies. Men \ndistrust them. A. Sargent well expresses the common opinion:\nHumanity is still captive of a metaphysical and dogmatic men­\ntality at a time when experimental science (technique) could be­\nyond any doubt allow them to solve their principal difficulties. \nWe are still half buried in scholasticism at a time when biology \nis in a position to be our salvation . . . Our dogmatisms have well \nshown their mischievousness . . .  It is therefore indispensable \nhenceforth to resist the seductions of systems based on metaphysics \nand to face up to the one reality which we can understand and \nwhich concerns us . . . The life-sciences bring together certain \nmeans of knowledge and action. All doctrines which draw their \ninspiration from abstract conceptions have already betrayed their \nfundamental incapacity to organize the human world. Biocracy, \nthat is, organization in accordance with the basic laws of life, \nrepresents our only chance of salvation at a moment of our devel­\nopment in which the various metaphysics and systems left over \nfrom archaic cultures still corrupt human life.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (415\nSargent’s position is clear. What is catastrophic in our situation is \nthe survival of philosophies, political doctrines, and religion. (I am \nunable, incidentally, to believe them so powerful!) As to tech­\nnique, it is completely innocent of the imminent catastrophes. De­\nspite exaggerations, the text is clear: no other solution is possible, \nno other hope, than that represented by the improvement of human \ntechniques. Every other solution is either inefficient or mis­\nchievous.\nSargent’s attitude is representative of that of the majority of \ntechnicians. We have already examined the kind of future it holds \nin store for us.\nIntegration of the Instincts and of the Spiritual. We shall now \ntake up perhaps the most difficult technical phenomena to grasp, \ninasmuch as they do not concern human techniques directly, but \nrather certain of their results.\nIt is often objected that skeptics fail to understand the nature \nof technical society because they are unwilling or unable to accept \nthe extraordinary power of spiritual resistance to technical inva­\nsion of which human beings are capable. Everywhere, it is said, \nhuman liberty affirms itself in a world that the skeptics have de­\nclared closed to it. In proof of this, literary and musical forms are \ninvoked like magical incantations. Abstract painting, surrealism, \njazz; ethical forms such as “eroticism” and the “politics of engage­\nment” are said to be manifestations of the supremacy of human \nfreedom and will in the technical society. No one, of course, seeks \nto deny that these phenomena are immediately related to the tech- \nnicity of the present; the question is how they are to be interpreted. \nIt is true that man has psychic power, the strength of which is not \nyet known Man is capable of outbursts of passion and violence. It \ndoes not seem that those sources of vital energy which might be \nsummarized as sexuality, spirituality, and capacity for feeling have \nbeen impaired.\nBut every time these forces attempt to assert themselves, they \nare flung against a ring of iron with which technique surrounds \nand localizes them. Moreover, technique attacks man, impairs the \nsources of his vitality, and takes away his mystery. We have seen \nthat one of the objectives of certain human techniques is to rob \nhim of this mystery. And men must and do react instinctively and \nspiritually to the aggression of technique.

When the American Negro was still a slave, jazz meant \nrelease from despair and chains. But it is questionable that eroti­\ncism and jazz really represent a purposive reaction to technical \naggression. We cannot settle these problems by appealing to a \npurely verbal idealism.\nJazz is one of today’s most authentically human protests. Let us \ntrace it back to its origin. The Negroes were hopelessly enslaved. \nThe story of their toil, punishments, hate, and crushed rebellions \nhas been often told. The terrible black emperor of Santo Domingo \nwas now no more than a dream. In their extremity the Negroes \ndiscovered song, which likewise answered the needs of faith. \nMusic expressed for them at once the despair of the present and \nthe hope for salvation in Christ. Its culmination in delirium \nbrought deliverance, but only as opium and alcohol did for others. \nMarx’s celebrated remark that nineteenth-century religion was the \nopiate of the European masses is equally applicable to the jazz of \nthe Negro slaves. In jazz they created a true art form. But with it \nthey also shut every door to freedom. Jazz imprisoned the Negroes \nmore and more in their slavery; from then on, they drew a morose \nrelish from it It is highly significant that this slave music has \nbecome the music of the modem world.\nAll instincts seem more unbridled today than ever before— sex; \npassion for nature, the mountains, and the sea; passion for social \nand political action. There cannot have been many historical pe­\nriods in which these forces were so evident or so authoritative. \nAgain, I have no wish to deny whatever validity they possess. It is \ngood for city dwellers to go to the country. It is good that a marked \neroticism is wrecking the sclerotic traditional morality. It is well \nthat poetry, thanks to such movements as surrealism, has become \nreally expressive once more. But these phenomena, whjch express \nthe deepest instinctive human passions, have also become totally \ninnocuous. They question nothing, menace nobody. Behemoth* \ncan rest easy; neither Henry Miller’s eroticism nor.Andr£ Breton’s \nsurrealism will prevent him from consuming mankind. Such move-\n* Behemoth (Hebrew; plural of majesty) designates matter organized, glorified, and \nset in motion.\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 417\nments are pure formalisms, pure verbalisms. No one has ever car­\nried out the famous “pure surrealist act.' And as for the self-styled \nrevolution in ethics of Miller and the “black novels' of Boris Vian \nand others, all they amount to for the noiinal man is an invitation \nto a brothel (something which has never passed for revolutionary \nor as an affirmation of freedom). It is harmless to attack a crum­\nbling middle-class morality. True, persecutions, seizures, and law­\nsuits have been directed against the “black' authors. But I would \nlike to point to the tidy profits that such minor scandals have \nbrought them. I am somehow unable to believe in the revolutionary \nvalue of an act which makes the cash register jingle so merrily.\nFor a like reason, the “politics of engagement' are vitiated. The \nmonolithic political parties consist of the fossilized rank and file \n(who can scarcely be thought to be manifesting any particular \nactivity or to be striking a blow for freedom merely because the \nhearse which is transporting them is rolling along at a clip) and of \nparty intellectuals and directors who are out after votes and \nmoney. It is as though a winner of the National Lottery could pass \nfor a martyr.\nThen there is the modern passion for nature.

Man is caught like a fly in a bottle. \nHis attempts at culture, freedom, and creative endeavor have be­\ncome mere entries in technique's filing cabinet.\nThe Final Resolution. A precise question is posed: Into what has \ntechnique transformed man’s efforts toward the spiritual?\nOne answer to this question is that technique possesses mo­\nnopoly of action. No human activity is possible except as it is \nmediated and censored by the technical medium. This is the great \nlaw of the technical society. Thought or will can only be realized \nby borrowing from technique its modes of expression. Not even the \nsimplest initiative can have an original, independent existence.\nSuppose one were to write a revolutionary book. If it is to be \npublished, it must enter into the framework of the technical or­\nganization of book publishing. In a predominantly capitalistic \ntechnical culture, the book can be published only if it can return \na profit. Thus, it must appeal to some public and hence must re­\nfrain from attacking the real taboos of the public for which it is \ndestined. The bourgeois publishing house will not publish Lenin; \nthe “revolutionary” publishing house will not publish Paul Bourget; \nand no one will publish a book attacking the real religion of our \ntimes, by which I mean the dominant social forces of the techno­\nlogical society. Any author who seeks to have his manuscript pub­\nlished must make it conform to certain lines laid down by the po­\ntential publishers. A manuscript which in subject matter and for­\nmat does not conform has no chance. This is the situation at the \nmost elementary level of the technical publishing organization. One \nstep further and we encounter the notorious system of the “re­\nwrite.”\nIf the publishing system is state-owned, the publication of revo­\nlutionary literature cannot even be considered. All this amounts to \nsaying that technical forces, which were put into operation ostensi­\nbly for the diffusion of thought, lead in practice to its emasculation. \nThe same holds true for broadcasting under private capitalism or \nunder state ownership. It is impossible to agree with the ideologues \nwho assert that capitalism is synonymous with freedom of broad­\ncasting4  or with those who assert that state ownership means \nhumanization.\n4  M . Veilte’s analysis of this point is convincing. See his La Radio et Us homines \n(Paris: Editions de M inuit; 1951).\n\f\nThe Technological Society (419\nO f course, we can write or teach anything, including por­\nnography, inflammatory revolutionary manifestoes, and new eco­\nnomic and political doctrines. But as soon as any of these appear \nto have any real effect in subverting the universal social order \n(which is establishing itself in every country of the world with the \nsupport of the overwhelming majority of the respective popula­\ntions), they are forthwith excluded from the technical channels of \ncommunication. As Crozier justly remarks: \"The intellectual has a \ndifficult life. He can only live by communicating, but he has been \ndeprived of the means without which he cannot communicate.” \nThe intellectual has become a mere mouthpiece subject to the de­\nmands of the various techniques. According to Wiener, this is the \ncause of the progressive sterilization of intellectual life in the \nmodem world. As Wiener puts it, present-day methods of com­\nmunication exclude all intellectual activity except what is so con­\nventional that it has no decisive value.\nIn the same way technique controls the nascent love of nature. \nThe lone city dweller on a camping trip escapes his technical fate \nmomentarily. But suppose that the solitary camper swells to a \nthrong, overflows the countryside, sets the woods on fire, and \ncommits other nuisances? Suppose he disturbs the “paying” guests? \nor trespasses on private property and hunting preserves? The pub­\nlic interest is then involved and technique intervenes, as it in­\nvariably does where large numbers of men are concerned. (In­\nversely, technique is creating a culture in which if large numbers \nare not involved, there is nothing at all.) Intervention then takes \nthe form of an administrative police technique. Obligatory camp \nsites are established, complete with regulations. The camper is \nforced to carry a license, and the erstwhile act of free individual \ndecision becomes a purely technical matter.\nWhen an individual engages in political action a corresponding \ntechnical mechanism is set in motion. Political action is no longer \npossible except as a mass phenomenon, and “engagement” pre­\nsupposes participation in a collectivity. Only a collectivity is \nwealthy enough to have at its disposal the means to “play politics.\" \nOnly a collectivity can make itself felt in a world in which tech­\nnique has given primacy to the quantitative rather than the qualita­\ntive. Since an inorganic mass would be inefficient, the collectivity \nmust be optimally organized, with all that this implies in the way\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES420)\nof unity, discipline, and tactical flexibility. These are the exclusive \nprovince of technical organization, a fact which straightway leads \nto the formation of monolithic political parties, which alone can \nhope for success. Once again technique imposes its iron law on the \ngenerous strivings of the individual heart.\nThese brief examples, taken from as diverse spheres as possible, \nmake it evident that today every human initiative must use techni­\ncal means to express itself. These technical means ipso facto \n“censor” initiative. First, they screen out whatever does not lend \nitself to technical expression; initiative remains a purely private \nmatter, with no importance to the technical society. Second, they \ncompel a rigid conformism; initiative is reduced to the lowest com­\nmon denominator and is, in effect, emasculated. The interplay of \nthe technical censorship with the pretended \"anarehic” spiritual \ninitiatives of the individual automatically produces the situation \ndesired by Dr. Coebbels in his formulation of the great law of the \ntechnical society: “You are at liberty to seek your salvation as you \nunderstand it, provided you do nothing to change the social order.” \nAll technicians without exception are agreed on this dictum. It is \nunderstood, of course, that the social order is everywhere essen­\ntially identical: the variation from democracy to Communism to \nFascism represents a merely superficial phenomenon.\nA  second answer to our question of how technique has trans­\nformed man’s quest for the spiritual involves an examination of the \nfate of the ecstatic *  impulses and phenomena of the human spirit.\nIt is not difficult to observe that ecstatic phenomena proliferate \nin proportion to the technicization of society. They play an impor­\ntant role in modern society, but not the role usually assigned them. \nThey function not as causes but as effects. It is childish to believe \nthat Communism and Fascism, for example, created a mystique \nout of whole cloth, which they then imposed on their peoples; that \nthey have blown up a vast bag of wind with which they “seduce” \nor “delude” the world. On the other hand, it is too easy to say that \nthe Russian soul and the German soul were naturally “predisposed” \nto these systems. We would then have to hold that the Italian ( and\n1 In what follows, the word ecstasy Is used in its original Creek sense to denote a \nmental state transported out of its usual condition. The word denotes anarchic and \nantisocial tendencies as well as the m ore pleasant transports we usually associate \nwith it. It is the ground of war as well as of religion. (Trans.)\n\f\nThe Technological Society (421\nnow the Yugoslav and Chinese) souls, are similarly predisposed. \nThe myth presupposes a psychological basis— that people adhere \nto systems because these systems respond to something “true” in \nthem. But this truth is certainly not very specific since very dif­\nferent sorts of people adhere to it. Further, mystic systems are not \narbitrary creations of dictatorial regimes. No more are they the \nresult of the demented will to power of the mighty. No \"popular \nmovement” can produce them; the requirements far exceed the \nspontaneous mystic capabilities of man. The real reason for the \nemergence of society as we know it is not mystic or psychic but \ntechnical.\nIt is nevertheless true that ecstatic phenomena are'found today \nin the societies that have as their avowed aim the maximal exploita­\ntion of technique. Ecstasy occurs here, however, not as a cause \nbut as a result of the technical society. More specifically, it is a \nfunction of the acceleration of the tempo of the technical society,* \nrather than of the technical level of the society.\nFor a long time it was believed that technique would yield a har­\nmonious society, a society in equilibrium, happy and without spe­\ncial problems. This society would resign itself to an easy life of \nproduction and consumption based on an untroubled commercial \nideology. This model of bourgeois tranquillity seemed to corre­\nspond exactly to the preoccupations of technology. The summum \nbonum was comfort, and the ideal type was capitalist Switzerland \nor socialist Sweden. The sudden plunge of the technically most \nadvanced societies into war and mutual destruction was a rude \nawakening for the bourgeoisie. An aberration? Scarcely. It had \nbeen forgotten that technique means not comfort but power. The \nbourgeois countries had developed their technical systems at a \ncomfortable pace, until these systems had fully exploited their pos­\nsibilities of orderly growth. Then technology, with its accelerated \ntempo, took over. The smaller nations were unable to keep up. \nAnd the great technical countries had willy-nilly to abandon their\n• Ellul anticipates here a recent preoccupation of so-called \"general system  theory,” \naccording to which social and psychological phenom ena depend for their specific \nresults on the acceleration of linear systems ana not upon their position or velocities. \nThe latter is usually a condition of equilibrium; the form er setaom  is. Thus, to give \na trivial example, it is not the absolute value of the world’s population at any \nmom ent which threatens social dissolution, but the rate at which it is increasing, \nespecially if the rate of increase is itself increasing.

The result was that disproportion between \nthe leisurely bourgeois mentality and the explosive tempo of tech­\nnique to which we give the name war. A by-product of this ecstasy \nwas a certain mystique. The American myth was bom, presenting \nexactly the same religious traits as the Nazi or Communist myth. \nBut it is different, as we have often noted, in that it still is in a \nspontaneous phase; it is not yet organized, utilized, and developed \ntechnically.\nWhatever the actual technical level of the country, as soon as \ntechnical acceleration appears, the mystique appears too. Even \ntechnically backward societies experience it as soon as they decide \nto adopt modern techniques. So do such societies as the Nazi or the \nCommunist when they take up and adapt to their system whatever \nis new. The more languid social groups, such as Switzerland or \nFrance, which cannot or will not submit to technical acceleration, \ndo not manifest these phenomena.’\nA nation which has reached a pitch of perfection in its technical \norganization sometimes feels this perfection to be intolerable. Suqh \na factor was probably the cause of the astonishing ecstasy of “com- \nbativity without object” which erupted in Sweden in December \n1956. In a too-perfect universe the human being has no adequate \nway of releasing the deepest impulses of human nature. These ob­\nscure forces are always there, and tend to emerge to the degree \nthat perfect technical constraint has not yet been fully achieved.\nThese observations confirm Roger Caillois’s statement that die \nmore restrictive the social mechanism, the more exaggerated are \nthe associated ecstatic phenomena. The restrictions imposed by \ntechnique on a society reduce the number of ways in which re­\nligious energy can be released. In a nontechnical society there are a \nplurality of ways in which psychic energy can be channeled; but \nin a technical society there is only one. Technical restrictions elimi­\nnate all secondary objects. Human psychic energies concentrate, \nand there are no ‘leaks.” The result is ecstatic phenomena of un­\nparalleled intensity and duration.\nIn today’s technical society, magical and mystical tendencies \nwhich traditionally were in opposition are all mutually satisfied by\nr Since 1958 France has experienced 1x>th rebirth of technical progress and a \nnationalistic mystique.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (423\ntechnique and hence mafle one. Technique fully satisfies the mystic \nwill to possess and dominate. It is unnecessary to evoke spiritual \npowers when machines give much better results. But technique \nalso encourages and develops mystical phenomena. It promotes the \nindispensable alienation from the self necessary, for example, for \nthe identification of the individual with an ideology. Whether man \nidentifies with a father figure or with an abstraction, this identifica­\ntion is incited by the recognition of an exceptional charismatic \nquality. This quality, integrated into the technical society, takes \nfrom it a compelling intensity it did not have before. It also takes \non a mechanical character. The ecstatic phenomenon, organized, \ncentralized, and diffused by technique, can only relate to a mecha­\nnized charism which is capable of this relation. This charismatic \nendowment has traditionally been an attribute of heroes, but today \nitis the “heroes of labor” who are so endowed.\nWe must conclude that it is far from accidental that ecstatic phe­\nnomena have developed to the greatest degree in the most techni- \ncized societies. And it is to be expected that these phenomena will \ncontinue to increase. This indicates nothing less than the subjec­\ntion of mankind's new religious life to technique. It was formerly \nbelieved that technique and religion were in opposition and repre­\nsented two totally different dispensations. It was held that, with \nthe development of a purely materialistic society, a struggle was \ninevitable between the machine and the economy, on the one side, \nand the ideal realm of religion, art, and culture, on the other. But \nwe can no longer hold such a boundlessly simplistic view. Ecstasy \nis subject to the world of technique and is its servant. Technique, \non the most significant level, integrates the anarchic and antisocial \nimpulses of the human being into society. These impulses take their \ninfluence and receive their diffusion strictly by virtue of the techni­\ncal means brought into play. The ecstatic phenomena of the human \npsyche, which without technical means would have remained \ncompletely without effect, are deployed throughout the world.\nTechnical means, acting on the ecstatic phenomena, encourage \ncertain daring innovations of expression. Consider, for example, the \nextraordinary artistic novelty of the cinema. But it must be re­\nmembered that the technical fact ipso facto entails the total in­\nclusion of art and thought (however revolutionary they seem) \nwithin the social framework. Human impulses are confined within\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES4 * 4 )\nwell-defined limits, and become the objects of propaganda, profit- \nseeking, contractual obligations, and the like. The vast extent of \nthe technical apparatus makes the “payoff” inevitably the primary \nconsideration, in money in the capitalist world, in power and au­\nthority in the Communist world. Technique as a means, however, \nencourages and enables the individual to express his ecstatic reac­\ntions in a way never before possible. He can express criticism of \nhis culture, and even loathing. He is permitted to propose the mad­\ndest solutions. The great law here is that all things are necessary to \nmake a society and that even revolt is necessary to make a techni­\ncal society. I believe that this is no exaggeration. Revolt is con­\nsciously organized in the Soviet Union, for example, in Krokodll, \nthe journal officially devoted to criticism of Soviet polity and ad­\nministration. The expression of criticism is permitted because its \nrepression would be even more catastrophic. But it is permitted \nonly on condition that it entail no serious consequences, or, better \nput, so that no serious consequences to the power of the state can \nresult The technical apparatus, in fact, assures this by confining \nthe most violent explosions of human ecstasy within itself and by \nsatisfying without clanger and at small cost to itself certain spiritual \nneeds of the citizen reader. It must not be supposed that there is \nany danger of the reader becoming a partisan of an author. Sartre \ncomplains that he has readers but no public. He gives certain com­\nplex reasons for this, and some of them may even be true. But he \ndoes not see (or perhaps refuses to see) that the technical condi­\ntions of publishing necessarily entail such a result. Sartre, of course, \nis not alone. What he complains of represents a long tradition. \nTechnique, which transforms culture into luxury, puts so- many \ncultural modalities at the reader's disposal that none of them has \nany more importance than any other; the customer becomes a \nbutterfly dipping into whatever flower he chooses. Sartre repre­\nsents one ten-thousandth of French authorship, and he reaches \ntwenty thousand readers. Not bad. But in the circumstances it is \ndifficult to have a genuine community of readers. (I take it that \nthe cellars of the Left Bank do not constitute the public Sartre \ndreams of.) Technique erects a screen between the author and his \nreaders. Miniature fireworks issue from the magic bottle, but not \nrevolt. A  few printed pages out of the deluge of printed matter \nwill never make the butterfly a revolutionary.\n\f\nThe Technological Society ( 42 5\nThe complete separation of thought and action effected by \ntechnique produces in a new guise a phenomenon which we have \nalready discussed as it appears in other areas: the lack of spiritual \nefficacy of even the best ideas. The very assimilation of ideas into \nthe technical framework which renders them materially effective \nmakes them spiritually worthless. This does not mean that ideas \nhave no worthwhile effect on the public at all. They have a great \neffect, but not the effect their creators intended. Henry Miller’s \nerotic petard, launched onto society like a plastic bomb, finds a \nreader whose sexual life is thwarted, who is upset by the conditions \nof his work, his lodgings, his political life. This has created in him \na thirst for revolt. And he finds his thirst powerfully and well ex­\npressed by Miller. The pornographic element unfetters his imagina­\ntion and plunges him into an erotic delirium that can satisfy his \ncontracted needs. But Miller’s book, far from pushing a man to \nrevolt, vicariously satisfies the potential revolutionary, just as the \nsexual act itself stills sexual desire, or jazz soothes the Negroes’ \nbitter longing for freedom. We have noted that jazz has become \nuniversal. The reason is now clear: it is the music of men who are \nsatisfied with the illusion of freedom provoked by its sounds, while \nthe chains of iron wind round them ever tighter. The same mecha­\nnism is at work on the reader of KrokodiL Seeing his discontent \nexpressed far better than he could express it himself, he is satisfied \nvicariously with an official revolt and ceases to criticize . . .  at \nleast for a while— but by then he will have received the next issue.\nAs a result of technique, these vicarious remedies are not local \nbut universal phenomena. Technique diffuses the revolt of the \nfew and thus appeases the need of the millions for revolt. The same \ncould be said of all the ‘’movements’’ started since the turn of the \ncentury in response to the frustration of the most elementary hu­\nman impulses. But can it be maintained, therefore, that social \nmovements such as surrealism, youth hostels, revolutionary politi­\ncal parties, anarchism, and so on, have failed? They have failed in \nthat they have not achieved their own goals of re-creating the \nconditions of freedom and justice or of allowing man to rediscover \na genuine sex life or intellectual life. But they have been com­\npletely successful from another point of view. They have per­\nformed the sociological function of integration. Technical means \nare so important, so difficult to achieve and to manage, that it is\n\f\nHUMAN TECHNIQUES426)\neasier to have them if there is a group, a movement, an association. \nSuch movements are based on authentic impulses and valid feel­\nings, and do allow a few individuals access to modes of expression \nwhich otherwise would have been closed to them. But their es­\nsential function is to act as vicarious intermediaries to integrate \ninto the technical society these same impulses and feelings which \nare possessed by millions of other men. Herein lies their Sociologi­\ncal character. Certain deep ecstatic instincts and impulses would \notherwise escape the jurisdiction of the technical society and be­\ncome a threat to it. Movements such as today’s existentialism, or \neroticism in the form of a renovated Marquis de Sade or of the \nlittle pornographic reviews, are a sociological necessity to a techni­\ncal milieu. The basic human impulses are unpredictable in their \ncomplex social consequences. But thanks to \"movements’*  which \nintegrate and control them, they are powerless to harm the techni­\ncal society, of which henceforth they form an integral part. These \nmovements perform a well-defined but completely involuntary \nfunction. Their operations are effected independently of will or \ndesire. And no one has calculated their effects in advance. Andr6 \nBreton and Henry Miller are innocent of the sociological function \nthey have assumed. One can reproach them only for a fearful \nlack of clarity as to their position and function in the technical \nsociety.\nAll revolutionary movements are burlesques of the real thing, but \nthis must not be imputed to the activities of Machiavellian wire­\npullers, The phenomenon appears naturally in the interaction of \nhuman techniques with social movements that seek to express basic \nhuman instincts. Our analysis could be repeated for pacifism, Com­\nmunism, and all the multifarious movements designed to secure \npeace or social justice. They all fall into the same pattern and \nfulfill the same function. Some are indeed more authentic and \n\"truer” than others because they better express human revolt; they \nare more successful in pulling the teeth of aggressive instincts and \nin integrating them into the technical society. (If I have not men­\ntioned religions, it is because they no longer express revolt; they \nhave long since, in their intellectual and sociological forms, under­\ngone integration.)\nWith the final integration of the instinctive and the spiritual by \nmeans of these human techniques, the edifice of the technical so-\n\f\nThe Technological Society (4*7\nciety will be completed It will not be a universal concentration \ncamp, for it will be guilty of no atrocity.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER\nm\nA LOOK AT \nTHE FUTURE\nWe have completed our examination of the monolithic technical \nworld that is coming to be. It is vanity to pretend it can be checked \nor guided. Indeed, the human race is beginning confusedly to \nunderstand at last that it is living in 2 new and unfamiliar universe. \nThe new order was meant to be a buffer between man and nature. \nUnfortunately, it has evolved autonomously in such a way that \nman has lost all contact with his natural framework and has to do \nonly with the organized technical intermediary which sustains \nrelations both with the world of life and with the world of brute \nmatter. Enclosed within his artificial creation, man finds that there \nis “no exit”; that he cannot pierce the shell of technology to find \nagain the ancient milieu to which he was adapted for hundreds of \nthousands of years.\nThe new milieu has its own specific laws which are not the laws \nof organic or inorganic matter. Man is still ignorant of these laws. \nIt nevertheless begins to appear with crushing finality that a new \nnecessity is taking over from the old. It is easy to boast of victory \nover ancient oppression, but what if victory has been gained at\n\f\nThe Technological Society (4*9\nthe price of an even greater subjection to the forces of the artificial \nnecessity of the technical society which has come to dominate our \nlives?\nIn our cities there is no more day or night or heat or cold. But \nthere is overpopulation, thraldom to press and television, total ab­\nsence of purpose. All men are constrained by means external to \nthem to ends equally external. The further the technical mechanism \ndevelops which allows us to escape natural necessity, the more we \nare subjected to artificial technical necessities. (I have analyzed \nhuman victory over hunger in this vein.) The artificial necessity \nof technique is not less harsh and implacable for being much less \nobviously menacing than natural necessity. When the Communists \nclaim that they place the development of the technical society in a \nhistorical framework that automatically leads to freedom through \nthe medium of the dialectical process; when Humanists such as \nBergson, or Catholics such as Mounier, assert that man must re­\ngain control over the technical “means” by an additional quantity \nof soul, all of them alike show both their ignorance of the technical \nphenomenon and an impenitent idealism that unfortunately bears \nno relation to truth or reality.\nAlongside these parades of mere verbalisms, there has been a \nreal effort, on the part of the technicians themselves, to control the \nfuture of technical evolution. The principle here is the old one we \nhave so often encountered: “A technical problem demands a tech­\nnical solution.” At present, there are two kinds of new techniques \nwhich the technicians propose as solutions.\nThe first solution hinges on the creation of new technical instru­\nments able to mediate between man and his new technical milieu. \nRobert Jungk, for example, in connection with the fact that man \nis not completely adaptable to the demands of the technical age, \nwrites that “it is impossible to create interstellar man out of the \nexisting prime matter; auxiliary technical instruments and appa­\nratus must compensate for his insufficiencies.” The best and most \nstriking example of such subsidiary instruments is furnished by the \ncomplex of so-called “thinking machines,” which certainly belong \nto a very different category of techniques than those that have \nbeen applied up to now. But the whole ensemble of means de­\nsigned to permit human mastery of what were means and have now \nbecome milieu are techniques of the second degree, and nothing\n\f\nA LOOK AT THE FUTURE4 3 0 )\nmore. Pierre de Latil, in his La PensSe artificielle, gives an ex­\ncellent characterization of some of these machines of the second \ndegree:\n“In the machine, the notion of finality makes its appearance, a \nnotion sometimes attributed in living beings to some intelligence \ninherent in the species, innate to life itself. Finality is artificially \nbuilt into the machine and regulates it, an effect requiring that \nsome factor be modified or reinforced so that the effect itself does \nnot disturb the equilibrium . . . Errors are corrected without hu­\nman analysis, or knowledge, without even being suspected. The \nerror itself corrects the error. A deviation from the prescribed track \nitself enables the automatic pilot to rectify the deviation . . .For \nthe machine, as for animals, error is fruitful; it conditions the cor­\nrect path.”\nThe second solution revolves about the effort to discover (or re­\ndiscover) a new end for human society in the technical age. The \naims of technology, which were clear enough a century and a half \nago, have gradually disappeared from view. Humanity seems to \nhave forgotten the wherefore of all its travail, as though its goals \nhad been translated into an abstraction or had become implicit; \nor as though its ends rested in an unforeseeable future of unde­\ntermined date, as in the case of Communist society. Everything \ntoday seems to happen as though ends disappear, as a result of \nthe magnitude of the very means at our disposal.\nComprehending that the proliferation of means brings about the \ndisappearance of the ends, we have become preoccupied with re­\ndiscovering a purpose or a goal. Some optimists of good will assert \nthat they have rediscovered a Humanism to which the technical \nmovement is subordinated. The orientation of this Humanism may \nbe Communist or non-Communist, but it hardly makes any dif­\nference. In both cases it is merely a pious hope with no chance \nwhatsoever of influencing technical evolution. The further we ad­\nvance, the more the purpose of our techniques fades out of sight \nEven things which not long ago seemed to be immediate objectives \n— rising living standards, hygiene, comfort— no longer seem to have \nthat character, possibly because man finds the endless adaptation \nto new circumstances disagreeable. In many cases, indeed, a \nhigher technique obliges him to sacrifice comfort and hygienic \namenities to the evolving technology which possesses a monopoly\n\f\nThe Technological Society (431\nof the instruments necessary to satisfy them. Extreme examples are \nfurnished by the scientists isolated at Los Alamos in the middle of \nthe desert because of the danger of their experiments; or by the \nwould-be astronauts who are forced to live in the discomfort of \nexperimental camps in the manner so graphically described by \nJungle.\nBut the optimistic technician is not a man to lose heart If ends \nand goals are required, he will find them in a finality which can be \nimposed on technical evolution precisely because this finality can \nbe technically established and calculated. It seems clear that there \nmust be some common measure between the means and the ends \nsubordinated to it The required solution, then, must be a technical \ninquiry into ends, and this alone can bring about a systematization \nof ends and means. The problem becomes that of analyzing indi­\nvidual and social requirements technically, of establishing, numeri­\ncally and mechanistically, the constancy of human needs. It fol­\nlows that a complete knowledge of ends is requisite for mastery of \nmeans. But, as Jacques Aventur has demonstrated, such knowledge \ncan only be technical knowledge. Alas, the panacea of merely \ntheoretical humanism is as vain as any other.1\n“Man, in his biological reality, must remain the sole possible \nreference point for classifying needs,” writes Aventur. Aventur’s \ndictum must be extended to include man’s psychology and soci­\nology, since these have also been reduced to mathematical calcu­\nlation. Technology cannot put up with intuitions and “literature.” \nIt must necessarily don mathematical vestments. Everything in \nhuman life that does not lend itself to mathematical treatment must \nbe excluded— because it is not a possible end for technique— and \nleft to the sphere of dreams.\nWho is too blind to see that a profound mutation is being ad­\nvocated here?

    "raw_text": "A LOOK AT THE FUTURE4 3 *)\nconstructed. He is also completely despoiled of everything that \ntraditionally constituted his essence. Man becomes a pure appear­\nance, a kaleidoscope of external shapes, an abstraction in a milieu \nthat is frighteningly concrete— an abstraction armed with all the \nsovereign signs of Jupiter the Thunderer.\nA Look at the Year aooo. In i960 the weekly T Express of Paris \npublished a series of extracts from texts by American and Rus­\nsian scientists concerning society in the year 2000. As long as such \nvisions were purely a literary concern of science-fiction writers and \nsensational journalists, it was possible to smile at them.’ Now we \nhave like works from Nobel Prize winners, members of the \nAcademy of Sciences of Moscow, and other scientific notables \nwhose qualifications are beyond dispute. The visions of these \ngentlemen put science fiction in the shade. By the year 2000, voy­\nages to the moon will be commonplace; so will inhabited artificial \nsatellites. All food will be completely synthetic. The world’s popu­\nlation will have increased fourfold but will have been stabilized. \nSea water and ordinary rocks will yield all the necessary metals. \nDisease, as well as famine, will have been eliminated; and there \nwill be universal hygienic inspection and control. The problems of \nenergy production will have been completely resolved. Serious \nscientists, it must be repeated, are the source of these predictions, \nwhich hitherto were found only in philosophic utopias.\nThe most remarkable predictions concern the transformation of \neducational methods and tire problem of human reproduction. \nKnowledge will be accumulated in “electronic banks” and trans­\nmitted directly to the human nervous system by means of coded \nelectronic messages. There will no longer be any need of reading \nor learning mountains of useless information; everything will be \nreceived and registered according to the needs of the moment. \nThere will be no need of attention or effort. What is needed will \npass directly from the machine to the brain without going through \nconsciousness.\nIn the domain of genetics, natural reproduction will be forbidden. \nA stable population will be necessary, and it will consist of the \nhighest human types. Artificial insemination will be employed. \nThis, according to Muller, will \"permit the introduction into a car-\n1 Som e excellent work*, inch as Robert Jungk’s Le Tutor « diji commend, wen \nincluded in this classliication.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (4 3 3\ntier uterus of an ovum fertilized in vitro, ovum and sperm . . . \nhaving been taken from persons representing the masculine ideal \nand the feminine ideal, respectively. The reproductive cells in \nquestion will preferably be those of persons dead long enough \nthat a true perspective of their lives and works, free of all personal \nprejudice, can be seen. Such cells will be taken from cell banks \nand will represent the most precious genetic heritage of hu­\nmanity . . . The method will have to be applied universally. If \nthe people of a single country were to apply it intelligently and \nintensively . . . they would quickly attain a practically invincible \nlevel of superiority . . .” Here is a future Huxley never dreamed of.\nPerhaps, instead of marveling or being shocked, we ought to \nreflect a little. A question no one ever asks when confronted with \nthe scientific wonders of the future concerns the interim period. \nConsider, for example, the problems of automation, which will \nbecome acute in a very short time. How, socially, politically, mor­\nally, and humanly, shall we contrive to get there? How are the \nprodigious economic problems, for example, of unemployment, to be \nsolved? And, in Muller’s more distant utopia, how shall we force \nhumanity to refrain from begetting children naturally? How shall \nwe force them to submit to constant and rigorous hygienic con­\ntrols? How shall man be persuaded to accept a radical transforma­\ntion of his traditional modes of nutrition? How and where shall \nwe relocate a billion and a half persons who today make their \nlivings from agriculture and who, in the promised ultrarapid con­\nversion of the next forty years, will become completely useless as \ncultivators of the soil? How shall we distribute such numbers of \npeople equably over the surface of the earth, particularly if the \npromised fourfold increase in population materializes? How will \nwe handle the control and occupation of outer space in order to \nprovide a stable modus vivendi? How shall national boundaries be \nmade to disappear? (One of the last two would be a necessity.) \nThere are many other -hows,” but they are conveniently left unfor­\nmulated. When we reflect on the serious although relatively minor \nproblems that were provoked by the industrial exploitation of coal \nand electricity, when we reflect that after a hundred and fifty years \nthese problems are still not satisfactorily resolved, we are entitled \nto ask whether there are any solutions to the infinitely more com­\nplex “hows” of the next forty years. In fact, there is one and only\n\f\nA LOOK A T THE FUTURE4 3 4 )\none means to their solution, a world-wide totalitarian dictatorship \nwhich will allow technique its full scope and at the same time re­\nsolve the concomitant difficulties. It is not difficult to understand \nwhy the scientists and worshippers of technology prefer not to \ndwell on this solution, but rather to leap nimbly across the dull and \nuninteresting intermediary period and land squarely in the golden \nage. We might indeed ask ourselves if we will succeed in getting \nthrough the transition period at all, or if the blood and the suffer­\ning required are not perhaps too high a price to pay for this \ngolden age.\nIf we take a hard, unromantic look at the golden age itself, we \nare struck with the incredible naivete of these scientists. They say, \nfor example, that they will be able to shape and reshape at will \nhuman emotions, desires, and thoughts and arrive scientifically at \ncertain efficient, pre-established collective decisions. They claim \nthey will be in a position to develop certain collective desires, to \nconstitute certain homogeneous social units out of aggregates of \nindividuals, to forbid men to raise their children, and even to \npersuade them to renounce having any. At the same time, they \nspeak of assuring the triumph of freedom and of the necessity of \navoiding dictatorship at any price.* They seem incapable of grasp­\ning the contradiction involved, or of understanding that what \nthey are proposing, even after the intermediary period, is in fact \nthe harshest of dictatorships. In comparison, Hitler’s was a trifling \naffair. That it is to he a  dictatorship o f  t e s t  t u b e s  r a t h e r  t h a n  of \nhobnailed boots will not make it any less a dictatorship.\nWhen our savants characterize their golden age in any but scien­\ntific terms, they emit a quantity of down-at-the-heel platitudes that \nwould gladden the heart of the pettiest politician. Let’s take a few \nsamples. “To render human nature nobler, more beautiful, and \nmore harmonious.” What on earth can this mean? What criteria, \nwhat content, do they propose? Not many, I fear, would be able \nto reply. “To assure the triumph of peace, liberty, and reason.” \nFine words with no substance behind them. “To eliminate cultural \nlag.” What culture? And would the culture they have in mind be \nable to subsist in this harsh social organization? “To conquer outer\n* The material here and below is cited from actual texts.\n\f\nThe Technological Society (435\nspace.” For what purpose? The conquest of space seems to be an \nend in itself, which dispenses with any need for reflection.\nWe are forced to conclude that our scientists are incapable of \nany but the emptiest platitudes when they stray from their special­\nties. It makes one think back on the collection of mediocrities ac­\ncumulated by Einstein when he spoke of God, the state, peace, and \nthe meaning of life. It is clear that Einstein, extraordinary mathe­\nmatical genius that he was, was no Pascal; he knew nothing of \npolitical or human reality, or, in fact, anything at all outside his \nmathematical reach. The banality of Einstein’s remarks in matters \noutside his specialty is as astonishing as his genius within it. It \nseems as though the specialized application of all one’s faculties in \na particular area inhibits the consideration of things in general. \nEven J. Robert Oppenheimer, who seems receptive to a general \nculture, is not outside this judgment. His political and social dec­\nlarations, for example, scarcely go beyond the level of those of the \nman in the street. And the opinions of the scientists quoted by \nfExpress are not even on the level of Einstein or Oppenheimer. \nTheir pomposities, in fact, do not rise to the level of the average. \nThey are vague generalities inherited from the nineteenth century, \nand the fact that they represent the furthest limits of thought of our \nscientific worthies must be symptomatic of arrested development \nor of a mental block. Particularly disquieting is the gap between \nthe enormous power they wield and their critical ability, which \nmust be estimated as null. To wield power well entails a certain \nfaculty of criticism, discrimination, judgment, and option. It is im­\npossible to have confidence in men who apparently lack these \nfaculties. Yet it is apparently our fate to be facing a “golden age” \nin the power of sorcerers who are totally blind to the meaning of \nthe human adventure. When they speak of preserving the seed of \noutstanding men, whom, pray, do they mean to be the judges. It \nis clear, alas, that they propose to sit in judgment themselves. It is \nhardly likely that they will deem a Rimbaud or a Nietszche worthy \nof posterity. When they announce that they will conserve the \ngenetic mutations which appear to them most favorable, and that \nthey propose to modify the very germ cells in order to produce \nsuch and such traits; and when we consider the mediocrity of the \nscientists themselves outside the confines of their specialties, we"

The “wherefore” is resolutely passed by. The re­\nsponse which would occur to our contemporaries is: for the sake \nof happiness. Unfortunately, there is no longer any question of \nthat One of our best-known specialists in diseases of the nervous \nsystem writes: \"We will be able to modify man’s emotions, desires \nand thoughts, as we have already done in a rudimentary way with \ntranquillizers.” It will be possible, says our specialist to produce a \nconviction or an impression of happiness without any real basis \nfor it. Our man of the golden age, therefore, will be capable of \n\"happiness” amid the worst privations. Why, then, promise us \nextraordinary comforts, hygiene, knowledge, and nourishment if, \nby simply manipulating our nervous systems, we can be happy \nwithout them? The last meager motive we could possibly ascribe to \nthe technical adventure thus vanishes into thin air through the very \nexistence of technique itself.\nBut what good is it to pose questions of motives? of Why? All that \nmust be the work of some miserable intellectual who balks at tech­\nnical progress. The attitude of the scientists, at any rate, is clear. \nTechnique exists because it is technique. The golden age will be \nbecause it will be. Any other answer is superfluous.\n\f\nBibliography\nIn connection with this bibliography, the following points should be noted:\nl) It makes no pretense to be exhaustive. I have listed only the works I \nhave actually used and cited in the text. And since books are made to be read \nand not consulted, 1 have refected the scholarly tradition of specifying pages \nin footnotes.\na) I have omitted systematically most works predating J940. They are \nreadily available elsewhere.\n3) I have also omitted literary works on technique, such as those of \nDuhamel, Huxley, Ernst Jiinger, Orwell, Cheorgiu, and others.\n4) I have not inserted references relating to propaganda and psychological \ntechniques, since these will be found m my forthcoming work on propaganda.\nTo these remarks of the author the translator wishes to odd that it was \nimpossible to check quotations cited in the text, since page references are \nlocking. In some cases, therefore, English has been translated into French \nand then back into English, a procedure which can conceivably lead to novel \neffects. But as M. Ellul has remarked, the books cited are to be read and not \nconsulted.\nPublisher's Note. This bibliography is somewhat less extensive \nthan the bibliography in the original French edition since it in­\ncludes only those works which are readily available in American \nlibraries."

He studied at the University \nof Bordeaux and at the University of Paris, and \nholds degrees in Sociology, Law , and the His­\ntory of Law. Since 1938  he has been associated \nw ith the University of Bordeaux as professor of \nHistory and Contemporary Sociology.\nDuring the Second W orld War, Professor Ellul \nwas a  leader in the French resistance movement, \nand since then he has been active in politics in \nhis native city. He is prominent in the worldwide \nEcumenical movement.\nAm ong his works are Propaganda (1965), and \nThe Political Illusion (1967).\n\f\nSOCIOLOGY & POLITICAL SCIENCE\n\"Jacques Ellul is a French sociologist, a Catholic layman active \nin the ecumenical movement, a leader of the French resistance \nin the war, and—one is tempted to add, after reading his book— \na great man. Certainly he has written a magnificent book. \n...The translation by John Wilkinson is excellent.\n\"With monumental calm and maddening thoroughness he goes \nthrough one human activity after another and shows how it has \nbeen technicized—rendered efficient—and diminished in the \nprocess....”\n— Paul Pickrel, Harper’s\n\"The Technological Society is one of the most important books \nof the second half of the twentieth century. In it, Jacques Ellul \nconvincingly demonstrates that technology, which we continue \nto conceptualize as the servant of man, will overthrow everything \nthat prevents the internal logic of its development, including hu­\nmanity itself—unless we take the necessary steps to move \nhuman society out of the environment that ‘technique’ is creat­\ning to meet its own needs.”\n— Robert Theobald, The Nation\n\"...The effect is a contained intellectual explosion, a heated \nrecognition of a tragic complication that has overtaken con­\ntemporary society.\"\n— Scott Buchanan, George Washington Law Review\n9 780394 703909 \nISBN □ - 3 C J4-7D3C JQ-1\nU.S.A. $12.00 \nC a n . $ 1 6 .9 5"
