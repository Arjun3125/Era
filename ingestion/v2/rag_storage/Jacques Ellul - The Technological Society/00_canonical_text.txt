Statement from the Publisher
I would never have heard of this book and its author were it not 
for my friend W. H. Ferry, Vice-President of the Center for the 
Study of Democratic Institutions of the Fund for the Republic, Inc., 
at Santa Barbara, California.
Sometime in 1961, Robert M. Hutchins and Scott Buchanan told 
Aldous Huxley of the Center’s interest in technology and asked his 
opinion about contemporary European works on the subject. Huxley 
recommended above all Ellul’s La Technique, which had been pub­
lished in Paris by Armand Colin in 1954 without having attracted 
much attention. At any rate the copies of the French original which 
the Center hastened to procure were from the first edition, as was 
also the copy I secured after my old friend Ferry had written me 
about it.
I couldn’t possibly read Ellul’s French, which apart from the 
matters with which he deals is very difficult, but since Scott Bu­
chanan and Columbia’s distinguished sociologist Robert K. Merton 
both said the book deserved publication in English, and since Mr. 
Buchanan had a translator at hand in John Wilkinson of the Center 
staff, who was willing to tackle this difficult and almost sure to be 
thankless job, I committed our firm to an undertaking that I soon 
began to call "Knopf’s folly.”
Members of the Center met Ellul in Greece in 1961, where he at* 
tended a conference as the Center’s guest and read a paper he had 
written at their request. They later paid him for a new introduction 
he had written for the American edition of La Technique. And 
the Center also helped to defray some extraordinary expenses in­
curred by Professor Wilkinson in the course of his work.
I wish belatedly to thank the Center publicly for all they did to 
help us with one of the most difficult editorial tasks Alfred A. Knopf, 
Inc., has ever undertaken. This note should have appeared in our 
first printing and I am sorry it did not.
Foreword
la  The Technological Society, Jacques Ellul formulates a compre­
hensive and forceful social philosophy of our technical civilization. 
Less penetrating than Thorstein Veblen’s The Engineers and the 
Price System, it nevertheless widens the scope of inquiry into the 
consequences of having a society pervaded by technicians. Ellul’s 
book is more colorful and incisive than Oswald Spengler’s Man and 
Technics— which by contrast seems faded and unperceptive— and 
it is more analytical than Lewis Mumford’s trilogy— although Ellul 
handles the historical evidence much more sparingly and with less 
assurance than Mumford. And it is more far-ranging and system­
atic than Siegfried Giedion’s Mechanization Takes Command, 
which, of all the books overlapping Ellul’s subject, comes close to 
giving the reader a sense of what the dominance of technique 
might mean for the present and the future of man. In short, what­
ever its occasional deficiencies, The Technological Society requires 
us to examine anew what the author describes as the essential 
tragedy of a civilization increasingly dominated by technique.
Despite Ellul’s forceful emphasis upon the erosion of moral 
values brought about by technicism, he has written neither a latter- 
day Luddite tract nor a sociological apocalypse. He shows that he 
is thoroughly familiar with the cant perpetuated by technophobes
Vi)
and for the most part manages to avoid their cliches. Indeed, he 
takes these apart with masterly skill to show them for the empty 
assertions they typically are. Neither does he merely substitute a 
high moral tone or noisy complaints for tough-minded analysis. 
His contribution is far more substantial. He examines the role of 
technique in modem society and offers a system of thought that, 
with some critical modification, can help us understand the forces 
behind the development of the technical civilization that is 
distinctively ours.
Enough of Ellul’s idiosyncratic vocabulary has survived the 
hazards of transoceanic migration to require us to note the special 
meanings he assigns to basic terms. By technique, for example, he 
means far more than machine technology. Technique refers to any 
complex of standardized means for attaining a predetermined 
result. Thus, it converts spontaneous and unreflective behavior into 
behavior that is deliberate and rationalized. The Technical Man is 
fascinated by results, by the immediate consequences of setting 
standardized devices into motion. He cannot help admiring the 
spectacular effectiveness of nuclear weapons of war. Above all, he 
is committed to the never-ending search for "the one best way” to 
achieve any designated objective.
Ours is a progressively technical civilization: by this Ellul means 
that the ever-expanding and irreversible rule of technique is ex­
tended to all domains of life. It is a civilization committed to the 
quest for continually improved means to carelessly examined ends. 
Indeed, technique transforms ends into means. What was once 
prized in its own right now becomes worthwhile only if it helps 
achieve something else. And, conversely, technique turns means 
into ends. “Know how” takes on an ultimate value.
The vital influence of technique is of course most evident in the 
economy. It produces a growing concentration of capital (as was 
presciently observed by Marx). Vast concentrations of capital re­
quire increasing control by the state. Once largely confined within 
the business firm, planning now becomes the order of the day for 
the economy as a whole. The dominance of technique imposes 
centralism upon the economy ( despite comparatively inconsequen­
tial efforts to decentralize individual industrial firms), for once 
technique develops beyond a given degree, there is no effective
Foreword {oil
alternative to planning. But this inevitable process is impersonal.
Only the naive can really believe that the world-wide movement 
toward centralism results from the machinations of evil statesmen.
The intellectual discipline of economics itself becomes techni- 
cized. Technical economic analysis is substituted for the older po­
litical economy included in which was a major concern with the 
moral structure of economic activity. Thus doctrine is converted 
into procedure. In this sphere as in others, the technicians form a 
closed fraternity with their own esoteric vocabulary. Moreover, 
they are concerned only with what is, as distinct from what ought 
to be.
Politics in turn becomes an arena for contention among rival 
techniques. The technician sees the nation quite differently from 
the political man: to the technician, the nation is nothing more 
than another sphere in which to apply the instruments he has de­
veloped. To him, the state is not the expression of the will of the 
people nor a divine creation nor a creature of class conflict. It is an 
enterprise providing services that must be made to function effi­
ciently. He judges states in terms of their capacity to utilize tech­
niques effectively, not in terms of their relative justice. Political 
doctrine revolves around what is useful rather than what is good. 
Purposes drop out of sight and efficiency becomes the central con­
cern. As the political form best suited to the massive and un­
principled use of technique, dictatorship gains in power. And this 
in turn narrows the range of choice for the democracies: either they 
too use some version of effective technique— centralized control 
and propaganda— or they will fall behind.
Restraints on the rule of technique become increasingly tenuous. 
Public opinion provides no control because it too is largely oriented 
toward “performance” and technique is regarded as the prime in­
strument of performance, whether in the economy or in politics, in 
art or in sports.
Not understanding what the rule of technique is doing to him 
and to his world, modem man is beset by anxiety and a feeling of 
insecurity. He tries to adapt to changes he cannot comprehend. 
The conflict of propaganda takes the place of the debate of ideas. 
Technique smothers the ideas that put its rule in question and filters 
out for public discussion Only those ideas that are in substantial
vlii)
accord with the values created by a technical civilization. Social 
criticism is negated because there is only slight access to the techni­
cal means required to reach large numbers of people.
In Ellul’s conception, then, life is not happy in a civilization domi­
nated by technique. Even the outward show of happiness is bought 
at the price of total acquiescence. The technological society requires 
men to be content with what they are required to like; for those 
who are not content, it provides distractions— escape into absorp­
tion with technically dominated media of popular culture and 
communication. And the process is a natural one: every part of a 
technical civilization responds to the social needs generated by 
technique itself. Progress then consists in progressive de-humani­
zation— a busy, pointless, and, in the end, suicidal submission to 
technique.
The essential point, according to Ellul, is that technique pro­
duces all this without plan; no one wills it or arranges that it be so. 
Our technical civilization does not result from a Machiavellian 
scheme. It is a response to the "laws of development" of technique.
In proposing and expanding this thesis, Ellul reopens the great 
debate over the social, political, economic, and philosophical mean­
ing of technique in the modem age. We need not agree with Ellul 
to learn from him. He has given us a provocative book, in the 
sense that he has provoked us to re-examine our assumptions and 
to search out the flaws in his own gloomy forecasts. By doing so, 
he helps us to see beyond the banal assertion that ours has become 
a mass society, and he leads us to a greater understanding of that 
society.

Translator's Introduction
Jacques EUul
as the Philosopher of the Technological Society
Ernst Jiinger once wrote that technology is the real metaphysics of 
the twentieth century. The irreversible collectivist tendencies of 
technology, whether it calls itself democratic or authoritarian, were 
already apparent to him, at the end of World War I. It is this so­
ciety, in all its forms, which Jacques Ellul, of the Faculty of Law 
of Bordeaux, seeks to analyze.
Professor Ellul, unlike most of the other surviving leaders of the 
French Resistance, still functions as a voice of conscience for a 
France which seems to feel itself in danger of being overwhelmed 
from literally every point of the compass by the materialistic values 
of the cold war— consumer society. Greater influence is enjoyed 
by others such as Malraux and Sartre; but Malraux is in the service 
of the welfare state (albeit one with Gallic flourishes) and Sartre 
is growing rich by dispensing absinthe morality in the cellars of 
the Left Bank. “I sometimes wonder," says Ellul in a related con­
nection, 'about the revolutionary value of acts accompanied by 
such a merry jingle of the cash register."
* )
Ellul’s principal work, this book, appeared under the title La 
Technique and the subtitle L'enjeu du siicle, The subtitle, which 
means literally "the stake of the century,” is a characteristically dark 
and difficult Ellulian phrase which may or may not refer to a kind 
of "Pascal wager” put on technology by twentieth-century man. 
The Technique of the title, however, lends itself more easily to in­
terpretation, although, characteristically, it too is used in a sense 
it does not usually enjoy. Technique, the reader discovers more or 
less quickly, must be distinguished from the several techniques 
which are its elements. It is more even than a generalized mechani­
cal technique; it is, in fact, nothing less than the organized ensemble 
of all individual techniques which have been used to secure any 
end whatsoever. Harold Lasswell’s definition comes closest to 
Ellul’s conception: “The ensemble of practices by which one uses 
available resources to achieve values.” This definition has the merit 
of emphasizing the scope of technique; but Ellul’s further account 
makes it clear that it does not go far enough, since technique has 
become indifferent to all the traditional human ends and values by 
becoming an end-in-itself. Our erstwhile means have all become an 
end, an end, furthermore, which has nothing human in it and to 
which we must accommodate ourselves as best we may. We cannot 
even any longer pretend to act as though the ends justified the 
means, which would still be recognizably human, if not particularly 
virtuous. Technique, as the universal and autonomous technical 
fact, is revealed as the technological society itself in which man is 
but a single tightly integrated and articulated component. The 
Technological Society is a description of the way in which an 
autonomous technology is in process of taking over the traditional 
values of every society witliCut exception, subvcitmg and sup~ 
pressing these values to produce at last a monolithic world culture 
in which all nontechnological difference and variety is mere ap­
pearance.
The technical malaise so deeply felt in non-Communist Europe 
at the imminent takeover has brought forth in recent years an as­
tonishingly large number of literary, philosophic, and sociological 
analyses of the technical phenomenon. One of the great merits of 
Ellul’s book arises from the fact that he alone has pushed such 
analysis to the limit in all spheres of human activity and in the 
totality of their interrelatedness. It may be added that what some
Translator's Introduction(xi
authors feel to be the book’s demerits arise from the same source; 
they maintain that society more often than not refuses to be pushed 
to that reductio ad absurdum which is the inevitable end point of 
every thoroughgoing analysis. The books of such authors generally 
end on a note of optimism. A final chapter always asks: "What is to 
be done?” Unfortunately, their answers to the question are either 
inefficacious myths which confront reality with slogans, or only too 
efficacious technical solutions to technical problems which end 
only in subjecting man the more thoroughly to technology. The 
former are exemplified by most modem religions, philosophical 
systems, and political doctrines; the latter by schemes for mass 
education or mass cultivation of leisure, which, in Ellul’s analysis, 
are themselves highly impersonal and technicized structures Hav­
ing much more in common with the assembly line than with what 
mankind has traditionally designated by these names.
The technological malaise seems to Have been much less acutely 
felt in the United States. Individuals such as Aldous Huxley, Paul 
Tillich, and Erich Fromm, who have raised their voices in protest, 
are of European origin and received their education in Europe. 
Technolaters such as Professors B. F. Skinner of Harvard and most 
other American professors represent the familiar type of the Ameri­
can intellectual caught in an ecstatic technical vertigo and seldom 
proceeding beyond certain vague meditations on isolated problem 
areas such as the “population explosion,” if indeed he considers 
the real problems posed by technology at all. Ellul holds the Ameri­
cans to be the most conformist people in the world, but in fairness 
it must be objected that, in his own analysis, the Soviets seem 
better to deserve this dubious honor since they have made even 
politics into a technique. The Americans, apart from technicizing 
the electoral process, have left at least the sphere of politics to the 
operations of amateurish bunglers and have thereby preserved a 
modicum of humanity. It may be added that France, too, has been 
taken into the technological orbit with a speed which must have 
astonished Ellul. De Gaulle’s plans for his new France contem­
plate the complete technicization of French society in nine years 
instead of the quarter century of grace which Ellul predicts in his 
book.
Since the religious object is that which is uncritically wor­
shipped, technology tends more and more to become the new god.
xtt)
This is true for all modern societies, but especially so for Com­
munist societies, since Marxism, in Ellul’s analysis of it, consciously 
identifies the material infrastructure, upon which the social super­
structure is raised, with technology.* The expression of technologi­
cal malaise in the Soviet Union or in Red China, where technolatry 
has become the new Establishment, would be blasphemy in the 
strictest sense of the word.
In composition and style, Ellul’s book is certain to be an enigma, 
and even a scandal, to many. It is not sociology, political economy, 
history, or any other academic discipline, at least as these terms are 
usually understood. It will not even appear to be philosophy to a 
generation whose philosophic preoccupations are almost exclu­
sively analytic. Ellul himself is in doubt about the value of the 
designation philosopher. But, if we think back to the dialectical 
philosophies of the whole of thinkers such as Plato and Hegel, 
Ellul's book is philosophy. If an American specialist, say, in eco­
nomics, with his ’’terribly linear” logic and his apparently un­
shakable conviction that his arbitrarily delimited systems can and 
should be studied in isolation from all others, were to flip open 
Ellul’s book to those sections which treat of matters economic, it is 
conceivable that he would be repelled by what he found. But if this 
same specialist could somehow or other implausibly be persuaded 
to persevere in the attempt to see with Ellul economics in the light 
of the whole of modem technical culture, it is likewise conceivable 
that he would gain important insights, not perhaps into the fine- 
structure of academic economic problems, but in the border region 
where his subject abuts on other disciplines, in that area where 
basic discoveries in economics (and everything else) are always 
made by gifted amateurs, who faute de mieux must be called 
philosophers.
Ellul’s admittedly difficult style is not to be referred to that 
style heurte affected by so many postwar French existentialists. 
An element of this is doubtless present, but it would be much more 
accurate to say that, in an essentially dramatic work such as the 
present book must be deemed to be, the transitions and turns of 
thought must have a character entirely different from those to be
1 Ellul once again showed much prescience. Marxist publications of the last few 
years have come to speak of the '‘technical-material infrastructure* instead of the 
^material infrastructure.*
Translator^s Introduction(xiii
encountered in the ultra-respectable academic texts which have 
taken over from mathematics certain linear and deductive modes 
of presentation; modes, which, whatever their pedagogic value may 
be, serve, even in mathematics, only to obscure the way in which 
truth comes into being. To its dramatic presentation of what are, 
after all, well-known facts, Ellul’s book owes its high persuasive 
quality.
This dramatic character would have been clearly evident if the 
book had been written as a dialogue. Indeed, a reader could easily 
cast it into this form by representing to himself the various thinkers 
who are introduced by name as the dramatis personae, and by 
treating the nameless “On the one hands” and "On the other 
hands” in the same way. In this way the "successive recantations” 
of some positions and the development of others in the light of a 
guiding concept of the whole become clear, and the book’s essen­
tial affinity to a Platonic dialogue like the Republic is evident. (No­
where is this successive recantation more evident than in the 
first chapter’s search for definitions.) Even clearer is the similarity 
of the book to Hegel’s Phanomenologie des Geistes, the last work of 
Western philosophy with which, in the translator’s opinion, the 
present work bears comparison. The Technological Society is not a 
“phenomenology of mind” but rather a "phenomenology of the 
technical state of mind.” Like Hegel’s book, it is intensely his­
trionic; and like it, it shows, without offering causal mechanisms, 
how its subject in its lowest stage (technique as machine tech­
nique) develops dialectically through the various higher stages 
to become at last the fully evolved phenomenon (the technical 
phenomenon identical with the technical society). Again, as with 
Hegel, what the philosopher J. Loewenberg has called the “his­
trionic irony” of statement must drive the literal-minded reader 
mad.
The Danish historian of philosophy, Harald Hoeffding, says of 
Hegel’s Phenomenology:
The course of development described in this unique work is at 
once that of the individual and of the race; it gives at the same 
time a psychology and a history of culture— and in the exposition 
the two are so interwoven that it is often impossible to tell which of 
the two is intended.
xiv)
With the stipulation that Ellul is treating of culture in the sense of the technological society, Hoeff ding’s penetrating remark holds as well for Ellul’s book.In such a work it is impossible to separate method from content. Yet, in another sense, and especially for a translator, it is impera­tive to do so. Although, after the time of Descartes, French savants in general were preoccupied with clarifying problems of method, it has been almost impossible in the twentieth century to extort from French writers on sociology and economics an adequate ac­count of their procedures. Some of them have doubtless been over­sensitive to Poincare s famous jibe concerning the sciences “with the most methods and the fewest results.” In Ellul’s case, however, disinclination to discuss methodology specifically is almost cer­tainly due in large part to his pervasive distrust of anything at all resembling a fixed doctrine. Nevertheless, throughout the book are scattered a large number of references to method, and it is possible and necessary to reconstruct from them a satisfactory account of the author’s methodology.Ellul first “situates” the “facts” of experience in a general context, and then proceeds to “focus” them. This figure of speech, drawn from, or at least appropriate to, descriptive astronomy, appears over and over again in connection with each supervening stage of complexity of the subject matter. The final result of the procedure is to bring to a common focal point rays proceeding from very difltueul 5plieicj», The reader should be warned that it is only pos­sible to approximate in English the mixed metaphors and the studied imprecisions of each new beginning of the process, which are gradually refined to yield at the focus a precise terminology.

rue iraiisiaioi was arways uncomioruiDiy aware or too little pre­cision, or too much, in his choice of English words. The reader seri­
ously interested in these nuances has no recourse but to consult the original. The translator can do little more for him than to call his attention to the problem. Anyone familiar with similar “dialectic moments” in the works of Hegel or of Max Weber will understand at once what is meant.Ellul repeats again and again that he is concerned not to make value judgments but to report things as they are. One might be tempted to smile at such statements in view of the intensely per­sonal and even impassioned quality of a work in which one is never
Translators Introduction(xv
for a moment unaware where the authors own sympathies lie. 
Nonetheless, on balance, it seems clear that he has not allowed his 
own value judgments to intrude in any illegitimate way on ques­
tions of fact. “Fact” is very important to Ellul, but only as ex­
perienced in the context of the whole. Facts as they figure in un­
interpreted statistical analyses of a given domain, or as they may 
be revealed by opinion polls and in newspapers, are anathema to 
him; and he permits himself many diatribes against this kind of 
“abstract,” disembodied fact which is so dear to the hearts of 
Americans, at least as Ellul imagines them to be. With this proviso, 
Ellul can echo the dictum of Hegel’s Phenomenology that the only 
imaginable point of departure of philosophy is experience.
The insistence on rendering a purely phenomenological account 
of fact, without causal explanation of the interrelation of the sub­
ordinate facts, may seem distasteful to some readers. Since Aristotle 
it has been a common conception of science that we have knowl­
edge only when we know the Why. Admittedly, whenever causal 
knowledge is available, it is indeed valuable. But it ought not to be 
forgotten that such knowledge is increasingly hard to come by, and, 
in fact, hardly makes its appearance at all in modem physics, say, 
where one must, for the most part, be content with purely func­
tional (that is, phenomenological) equations, which dispense with 
any appeal to mechanism but which are nonetheless adequate for 
prediction and explanation, and which have the enormous addi­
tional advantage of containing no hidden concepts unconfront- 
able by experience. The important questions concerning the techno­
logical society rarely turn for Ellul on how or why things came to 
be so, but rather on whether his description of them is a true one.
Ellul’s methodology is fundamentally dominated by the prin­
ciple which has come to be called Engel’s law, that is, the law 
asserting the passage of quantity into quality. To give a common­
place example, the city, after it reaches a certain threshold of 
population, is supposed to pass over into a qualitatively different 
type of urban organization. Unfortunately, both the popular and 
the usual philosophical accounts of Engel’s law are incomplete, to 
use no worse word.
First, it is incorrect to speak at all of a “threshold” of quantity 
which, having been transcended, gives rise to a change of quality 
and to a new set of laws and explanatory principles. In dialectical
*»<)
logic, every change of quantity is simultaneously a change of 
quality; and the discernment of a 'threshold'* quantity is partly a 
psychological fact of awareness, and partly an illicit attempt to try 
to import back into a dialectical logic some of the unequivocalness 
of the ordinary either/or logic. Now, Ellul's explanation of the 
technical takeover is based fundamentally on the fact that the ma­
terial (that is, technical) substratum of human existence, which 
was traditionally not allowed to be a legitimate end of human ac­
tion, has become so “enormous,” so “immense," that men are no 
longer able to cope with it as means, so that it has become an 
end-in-itself, to which men must adapt themselves. But, with a 
better understanding of the illusory nature of the “threshold quan­
tity," we are able to turn aside the objections which are always 
raised by those who rightly but extraneously urge that historical 
societies have always had to struggle with the possibility of a ma­
terial takeover and that the present state of affairs is therefore not 
something new. The answer, of course, is that the objection is ir­
relevant. Ellul could not mean to assert that men in the past have 
not had to contend with material means which threatened to ex­
ceed their capacity to make good use of them, but that men in the 
past were not confronted with technical means of production and 
organization which in their sheer numerical proliferation and ve­
locity unavoidably surpassed man’s relatively unchanging biologi­
cal and spiritual capacities to exploit them as means to human 
ends.
Second, Engel’s law must never be taken to imply a one-way 
transition of quantity into quality. In dialectical logic the trans­
formation of quality into quantity is a necessary concomitant 
of the reversible tn*ns£orm?.Hoii into nnalitv. It is in
fact, the essence of technique to compel the qualitative to become 
quantitative, and in this way to force every stage of human activity 
and man himself to submit to its mathematical calculations. Ellul 
gives examples of this at every level. Thus, technique forces all 
sociological phenomena to submit to the clock, for Ellul the most 
characteristic of all modem technical instruments. The substitution 
of the tempos mortuum of the mechanical clock for the biological 
and psychological time “natural” to man is in itself sufficient to 
suppress all the traditional rhythms of human life in favor of the 
mechanical. Again, genuine human communities are suppressed by
Translators Introduction(xoii
the technological society to form collectivities of 'mass men* in* 
capable of obeying any other law than the statistical "law of large 
numbers.* All the technical devices of education, propaganda, 
amusement, sport, and religion are mobilized to persuade the hu­
man being to be satisfied with his condition of mechanical, mind­
less "mass man,* and ruthlessly to exterminate the deviant and the 
idiosyncratic.
The reduction of everything to quantity is partly a cause, and 
partly an effect, of the modem omnipresence of computing ma­
chines and cybernated factories.
It should not be imagined, however, that the universal concentra­
tion camp which Ellul thinks is coming into being in all technical 
societies without exception will be felt as harsh or restrictive by its 
inmates. Hitler’s concentration camps of hobnailed boots were 
symptoms of a deficient political technique. The denizen of the 
technological state of the future will have everything his heart ever 
desired, except, of course, his freedom. Admittedly, modem man, 
forced by technique to become in reality and without residue the 
imaginary producer-consumer of the classical economists, shows 
disconcertingly little regard for his lost freedom; but, according to 
Ellul, there are ominous signs that human spontaneity, which in 
the rational and ordered technical society has no expression except 
madness, is only too capable of outbreaks of irrational suicidal de­
structiveness.
The escape valves of modem literature and art, which technique 
has contrived, may or may not turn out to be adequate to the harm­
less release of the pent-up “ecstatic” energies of the human bang. 
Technique, which can in principle only oppose technical and quan­
titative solutions to technical problems, must, in such a case, seek 
out other technical safety valves. It could, for example, convince 
men that they were happy and contented by means of drugs, even 
though they were visibly suffering from the worst kind of spiritual 
and material privation. It is obvious that off such ultimate technical 
measures must cause the last meager “idealistic* motifs of the whole 
technical enterprise to disappear. Ellul does not specifically say 
so, but it seems that he must hold that the technological society, 
like everything else, bears within itself the seeds of its own destruc­
tion.
It must not be imagined that the autonomous technique en-
xviii)
visioned by Ellul is a kind of "technological determinism,” to use a 
phrase of Veblen. It may sometimes seem so, but only because all 
human institutions, like the motions of all physical bodies, have a 
certain permanence, or vis inertiae, which makes it highly probable 
that the near future of statistical aggregations will see them con­
tinue more or less in the path of the immediate past. Things could 
have eventuated in the technological society otherwise than as they 
have.
Technique, to Ellul, is a “blind" force, but one which unfortu­
nately seems to be more perspicacious than the best discernible 
human intelligences. There are other ways out, Ellul maintains, but 
nobody wants any part of them.
Ellul’s insistence that the technical phenomenon is not a de­
terminism is not weakened by the enumeration (in the second 
chapter) of five conditions which are said to be “necessary and 
sufficient” for its outburst in the recent past, since the sufficient con­
ditions for the conditions (for example, the causes of the popula­
tion explosion) are not ascertainable.
The inertia of the technical phenomenon guarantees not only the 
continued refinement and production of relatively beneficial arti­
cles such as flush toilets and wonder drugs, but also the emergence 
of those unpredictable secondary effects which are always the re­
sult of ecological meddling and which today are of such magnitude 
and acceleration that they can scarcely be reconciled with even 
semistable equilibrium conditions of society. Nuclear explosions 
and population explosions capture the public’s imagination; but I 
have argued that Ellul’s analysis demands that all indices of mod­
em technological culture are exploding, too, and are potentially 
jusi as dangerous to the cuuuiiucd wcii-bcing of society, if by well­
being we understand social equilibrium.
Reference to the vis inertiae of technique should not obscure the 
fact that technique has become the only fully spontaneous activity 
of the modem world. Art and science are mentioned as other hu­
man activities by Ellul. But art, though it is concrete, is subjective; 
and science, though objective in its description of reality, is ab­
stract. Only technique is at once both concrete and objective in 
that it creates the reality it describes. Ellul must conclude that 
from among the data of science technique legislates those which it 
deems most efficient and rejects the rest Economic and social

"model builders,” those assiduous technocratic apes, may seek to 
soften the violence of this description by pointing out that all 
sciences “specify a universe of discourse.” It remains unfortunately 
true, however, that such “specification” proceeds by way of elimina­
tion of the human;
Ellul is no machinoclast like the partisans of the weak-minded 
Ludd seeking to wreck the stocking frames. He has no doctrinal de­
lusions at all, a fortiori none like those of Rousseau and certain of 
his disciples, who imagined that man would be happy in a state 
of nature.
In view of the fact that Ellul continually apostrophizes technique 
as “unnatural” (except when he calls it the “new nature” ), it might 
be thought surprising that he has no fixed conception of nature 
or of the natural. The best answer seems to be that he considers 
“natural” (in the good sense) any environment able to satisfy man's 
material needs, if it leaves him free to use it as means to achieve 
his individual, internally generated ends. The necessary and suffi­
cient condition for this state of affairs is that man’s means should 
be (qualitatively and quantitatively) “at the level” of man’s ca­
pacities. Under these dubiously realizable circumstances, Ellul 
apparently thinks of techniques as so many blessings.
Since men are unwilling to acknowledge their demotion to die 
status of joyous robots, and since they demand justification for their 
individual and collective acts as never before in history, it is easy 
to understand why the modern intellectuals (and their forcing- 
house, the university) have become veritable machines for the in­
vention of new myths and the propagation of old ones. It would 
be easy to compile a list of all the things which Ellul must deem 
“myth.” Such a list would quite simply contain all philosophical, 
historical, religious, and political doctrines known to man, except 
insofar as such doctrines have technological components. The 
Western democracies, for example, are out after money and the 
Eastern Communists are out after power; otherwise they share an 
identical view of life, and the epiphenomenal variant ideologies 
which accompany identical acts can only be described as a cruel 
hoax.
It is disconcerting in the extreme to contemplate the possibility 
that cherished democratic institutions have become empty forms 
which have no visible connection with the acts of democratic na
XX)
Uons, except perhaps to render these acts technically less efficient 
than they otherwise need have been. But the fact that they have no 
connection is, paradoxically, a powerful reason for their survival. 
Ellul evidently contemplates a long future in which sclerotic rival 
ideologies will carry on their sham polemics.
Ellul, in agreement with much of Creek philosophy, seems to 
think that the distinction usually drawn between thought and ac­
tion is a pernicious one. To him, to bear witness to the fact of the 
technological society is the most revolutionary of all possible acts. 
His personal reason for doing so is that he is a Christian, a fact 
which is spelled out in his book La Presence. His concept of the 
duty of a Christian, who stands uniquely (is “present” ) at the point 
of intersection of this material world and the eternal world to come, 
is not to concoct ambiguous ethical schemes or programs of social 
action, but to testify to the truth of both worlds and thereby to 
affirm his freedom through the revolutionary nature of his religion.
It is clear that many people who will accept Elluls diagnosis of 
the technical disease will not accept his Christian therapy. The is­
sue is nevertheless joined: if massive technological intervention is 
the only imaginable means to turn aside technology from its head­
long career, how may we be sure that this intervention will be 
something other than just some new technical scheme, which, more 
likely than not, will be catastrophic?

Note to the Reader
I think the task of the reader will be lightened if at the outset I at­
tempt a definition of technique. The whole first chapter is devoted 
to making clear what constitutes technique in the present-day 
world, but as a preliminary there must be a simple idea, a defini­
tion.
The term technique, as I use it, does not mean machines, tech­
nology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end. In our 
technological society, technique is the totality of methods rationally 
arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of de­
velopment ) in every field of human activity. Its characteristics are 
new; the technique of the present has no common measure with 
that of the past.
This definition is not a theoretical construct. It is arrived at by 
examining each activity and observing the facts of what modern 
man calls technique in general, as well as by investigating the dif­
ferent areas in which specialists declare they have a technique.
In the course of this work, the word technique will be used with 
varying emphasis on one or another aspect of this definition. At one 
point, the emphasis may be on rationality, at another on efficiency 
or procedure, but the over-all definition will remain the same.
Finally, we shall be looking at technique in its sociological aspect;
xxoi)
that is, we shall consider the effect of technique on social relation­
ships, political structures, economic phenomena. Technique is not 
an isolated fact in society (as the term technology would lead us 
to believe) but is related to every factor in the life of modern man; 
it affects social facts as well as all others. Thus technique itself is a 
sociological phenomenon, and it is in this light that we shall study 
it.

Jacques Ellul
Author s Foreword to the 
Revised American Edition
At the beginning I must try to make clear the direction and aim 
of this book. Although descriptive, it is not without purpose. I do 
not limit myself to describing my findings with cold objectivity in 
the manner qf a research worker reporting what he sees under a 
microscope. I am keenly aware that I am myself involved in 
technological civilization, and that its history is also my own. I may 
be compared rather with a physician or physicist who is describing 
a group situation in which he is himself involved. The physician 
in an epidemic, the physicist exposed to radioactivity: in such 
situations the mind may remain cold and lucid, and the method 
objective, but there is inevitably a profound tension of the whole 
being.
Although I have deliberately not gone beyond description, the 
reader may perhaps receive an impression of pessimism. I am 
neither by nature, nor doctrinally, a pessimist, nor have I pessimis­
tic prejudices. I am concerned only with knowing whether things 
are so or not. The reader tempted to brand me a pessimist should 
begin to examine his own conscience, and ask himself what causes 
him to make such a judgment. For behind this judgment, I believe, 
will always be found previous metaphysical value judgments, such
xxvHi')
as: “Man is free”; "Man is lord of creation”; “Man has always over­
come challenges” (so why not this one too?); “Man is good.” Or 
again: “Progress is always positive”; “Man has an eternal soul, and 
so cannot be put in jeopardy.” Those who hold such convictions 
will say that my description of technological civilization is in­
correct and pessimistic. I ask only that the reader place himself on 
the factual level and address himself to these questions: “Are the 
facts analyzed here false?” “Is the analysis inaccurate?” “Are the 
conclusions unwarranted?" “Are there substantial gaps and omis­
sions?” It will not do for him to challenge factual analysis on 
the basis of his own ethical or metaphysical presuppositions.
The reader deserves and has my assurance that I have not set out 
to prove anything. I do not seek to show, say, that man is deter­
mined, or that technique is bad, or anything else of the kind.
Two other factors may lead the reader to the feeling of pessi­
mism. It may be that he feels a rigorous determinism is here de­
scribed that leaves no room for effective individual action, or that 
he cannot find any solution for the problems raised in the book. 
These two factors must now engage our attention.
As to the rigorous determinism, I should explain that I have tried 
to perform a work of sociological reflection, involving analysis of 
large groups of people and of major trends, but not of individual 
actions. I do not deny the existence of individual action or of some 
inner sphere of freedom. I merely hold that these are not discerni­
ble at the most general level of analysis, and that the individual’s 
acts or ideas do not here and now exert any influence on social, 
political, or economic mechanisms. By making this statement, I 
explicitly take a partisan position in a dispute between schools of 
sociology. To me the sociological does not consist of the addition 
and combination of individual actions. I believe that there is a col­
lective sociological reality, which is independent of the individual. 
As I see it, individual decisions are always made within the frame­
work of this sociological reality, itself pre-existent and more or less 
determinative. I have simply endeavored to describe technique as 
a sociological reality. We are dealing with collective mechanisms, 
with relationships among collective movements, and with modifi­
cations of political or economic structures. It should not be sur­
prising, therefore, that no reference is made to the separate, inde-
Authors Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxix
pendent initiative o f individuals. It is not possible for me to treat 
the individual sphere. But I do not deny that it exists. I do not 
maintain that the individual is more determined today than he has 
been in the past; rather, that he is differently determined. Primi­
tive man, hemmed in by prohibitions, taboos, and rites, was, of 
course, socially determined. But it is an illusion— unfortunately 
very widespread— to think that because we have broken through 
the prohibitions, taboos, and rites that bound primitive man, we 
have become free. We are conditioned by something new: techno­
logical civilization. I make no reference to a past period of history 
in which men were allegedly free, happy, and independent. The 
determinisms of the past no longer concern us; they are finished 
and done with. If I do refer to the past, it is only to emphasize that 
present determinants did not exist in the past, and men did not 
have to grapple with them then. The men of classical antiquity 
could not have found a solution to our present determinisms, and it 
is useless to look into the works of Plato or Aristotle for an answer 
to the problem of freedom.
Keeping in mind that sociological mechanisms are always sig­
nificant determinants— of more or less significance— for the indi­
vidual, I would maintain that we have moved from one set of 
determinants to another. The pressure of these mechanisms is 
today very great; they operate in increasingly wide areas and pene­
trate more and more deeply into human existence. Therein lies the 
specifically modern problem.
This determinism has, however, another aspect. There will be a  
temptation to use the word fatalism in connection with the phe­
nomena described in this book. The reader may be inclined to say 
that, if everything happens as stated in the book, man is entirely 
helpless— helpless either to preserve his personal freedom or to 
change the course of events. Once again, I think the question is 
badly put. I would reverse the terms and say: if man— if each one 
of us— abdicates his responsibilities with regard to values; if each 
of us limits himself to leading a  trivial existence in a  technological 
civilization, with greater adaptation and increasing success as his 
sole objectives; if we do not even consider the possibility of making 
a  stand against these determinants, then everything will happen as 
I have described it, and the determinants teiU  be transformed into 
inevitabilities. But, in describing sociological currents, I obviously
XXX )
cannot take into account the contingent decisions of this or that 
individual, even if these decisions could modify the course of social 
development. For these decisions are not visible, and if they are 
truly personal, they cannot be foreseen. I have tried to describe the 
technical phenomenon as it exists at present and to indicate its 
probable evolution. Fatalism is not involved; it is rather a question 
of probability, and I have indicated what I think to be its most 
likely development.
What is the basis for this most likely eventuality? I would say 
that it lies in social, economic, and political phenomena, and in 
certain chains of events and sequences. If we may not speak of 
laws, we may, at any rate, speak of repetitions. If we may not 
speak of mechanisms in the strict sense of the word, we may speak 
of interdependencies. There is a certain logic (though not a formal 
logic) in economic phenomena which makes certain forecasts pos­
sible. This is true of sociology and, to a lesser degree, of politics. 
There is a certain logic in the evolution of institutions which is 
easily discernible. It is possible, without resorting to imagination 
or science fiction, to describe the path that a social body or institu­
tional complex will follow. An extrapolation is perfectly proper 
and scientific when it is made with care. Such an extrapolation is 
what we have attempted. But it never represents more than a 
probability, and may be proved false by events.
External factors could change the course of history. The probable 
development I describe might be forestalled by the emergence of 
new phenomena. I give three examples— widely different, and de­
liberately so— of possible disturbing phenomena:
1) If a general war breaks out, and if there are any survivors, 
the destruction will be sc enormous, and the conditions of survival
so different, that a technological society will no longer exist.
a) If an increasing number of people become fully aware of the 
threat the technological world poses to man’s personal and spiritual 
life, and if they determine to assert their freedom by upsetting the 
course of this evolution, my forecast will be invalidated.
3) If God decides to intervene, man’s freedom may be saved by 
a change in the direction of history or in the nature of man.
But in sociological analysis these possibilities cannot be con­
sidered. The last two lie outside the field of sociology, and confront 
us with an upheaval so vast that its consequences cannot be as-
Authors Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxxi
sessed. But sociological analysis does not permit consideration o( 
these possibilities. In addition, the first two possibilities offer no 
analyzable fact on which to base any attempt at projection. They 
have no place in an inquiry into facts; I cannot deny that they may 
occur, but I cannot take them rationally into account. I am in the 
position of a physician who must diagnose a disease and guess its 
probable course, but who recognizes that God may work a miracle, 
that the patient may have an unexpected constitutional reaction, or 
that the patient— suffering from tuberculosis— may die unex­
pectedly of a heart attack. The reader must always keep in mind 
the implicit presupposition that if man does not pull himself to­
gether and assert himself (or if some other unpredictable but 
decisive phenomenon does not intervene), then things will go the 
way I describe.
The reader may be pessimistic on yet another score. In this study 
no solution is put forward to the problems raised. Questions are 
asked, but not answered. I have indeed deliberately refrained 
from providing solutions. One reason is that the solutions would 
necessarily be theoretical and abstract, since they are nowhere ap­
parent in existing facts. I do not say that no solutions will be 
found; I merely aver that in the present social situation there is 
not even a beginning of a solution, no breach in the system of tech­
nical necessity. Any solutions I might propose would be idealistic 
and fanciful. In a sense, it would even be dishonest to suggest solu­
tions: the reader might think them real rather than merely literary. 
I am acquainted with the “solutions” offered by Emmanuel Mou­
rner, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Ragnor Frisch, Jean Fourasti^, 
Georges Friedmann, and others. Unfortunately, all these belong to 
the realm of fancy and have no bearing on reality. I cannot ration­
ally consider them in analyzing the present situation.
However, I will not make a final judgment on tomorrow before it 
arrives. I do not presume to put chains around man. But I do 
insist that a distinction be made between diagnosis and treat­
ment. Before a remedy can be found, it is first necessary to make a 
detailed study of the disease and the patient, to do laboratory re­
search, and to isolate the virus. It is necessary to establish criteria 
that will make it possible to recognize the disease when it occurs, 
and to describe the patient’s symptoms at each stage of his illness.
xxxii)
This preliminary work is indispensable for eventual discovery and 
application of a remedy.
By this comparison I do not mean to suggest that technique is a 
disease of the body social, but rather to indicate a working proce­
dure. Technique presents man with multiple problems. As long as 
the first stage of analysis is incomplete, as long as the problems are 
not correctly stated, it is useless to proffer solutions. And, before 
we can pose the problems correctly, we must have an exact descrip­
tion of the phenomena involved. As far as I know, there is no 
over-all and exact description of the facts which would make it 
possible to formulate the problems correctly.
The existing works on the subject either are limited to a single 
aspect of the problem— the effect of motion pictures on the nerv­
ous system, for example— or else propose solutions without the req­
uisite preliminary study. I offer these pages as a first effort in lay­
ing the necessary ground; much more work will have to follow 
before we can see what man’s true response is to the challenge be­
fore him.
But this must not lead the reader to say to himself: 'A ll right, 
here is some information on the problem, and other sociologists, 
economists, philosophers, and theologians will carry on the work, so 
I have simply got to w a it' This will not do, for the challenge is not 
to scholars and university professors, but to all of us. At stake is our 
very life, and we shall need all the energy, inventiveness, imagina­
tion, goodness, and strength we can muster to triumph in our pre­
dicament While waiting for the specialists to get on with their 
work on behalf of society, each of us, in his own life, must seek 
ways of resisting and transcending technological determinants. 
Each man must make this effort in every area of life, in his profes­
sion and in his social, religious, and family relationships.
In my conception, freedom is not an immutable fact graven in 
nature and on the heart of man. It is not inherent in man or in so­
ciety, and it is meaningless to write it into law. The mathematical, 
physical, biological, sociological, and psychological sciences reveal 
nothing but necessities and determinisms on all sides. As a matter 
of fact, reality is itself a combination of determinisms, and freedom 
consists in overcoming and transcending these determinisms. Free­
dom is completely without meaning unless it is related to necessity, 
unless it represents victory over necessity. To say that freedom
Author t Foreword to the Revised American Edition (xxxiii
is graven in the nature of man, is t o say that man is free because he 
obeys his nature, or, to put it another way, because he is condi­
tioned by his nature. This is nonsense. We must not think of the 
problem in terms of a choice between being determined and be­
ing free. We must look at it dialectically, and say that man is in­
deed determined, but that it is open to him to overcome necessity, 
and that this act is freedom. Freedom is not static but dynamic; 
not a vested interest, but a prize continually to be won. Tie mo­
ment man stops and resigns himself, he becomes subject to deter­
minism. He is most enslaved when he thinks he is comfortably 
settled in freedom.
In the modem world, the most dangerous form of determinism 
is the technological phenomenon. It is not a question of getting rid 
of it, but, by an act of freedom, of transcending it How is this to 
be done? I do not yet know. That is why this book is an appeal to 
the individual’s sense of responsibility. The first step in th* quest, 
the first act of freedom, is to become aware of the necessity. The 
very fact that man can see, measure, and analyze the determinisms 
that press on him means that he can face them and, by so doing, 
act as a free man. If man were to say "These are not necessities; I 
am free because of technique, or despite technique," this would 
prove that he is totally determined. However, by grasping the real 
nature of the technological phenomenon, and the extent to which 
it is robbing him of freedom, he confronts the blind mechanisms as 
a conscious being.
At the beginning of this foreword I stated that this book has a 
purpose. That purpose is to arouse the reader to an awareness of 
technological necessity and what it means. It is a call to the sleeper 
to awake.

Author’s Preface to the 
French Edition
Let us, first of all, clear up certain misunderstandings that inevitably 
arise in any discussion of technique.
It is not the business of this book to describe the various tech­
niques which, taken together, make up the technological society. 
It would take a whole library to describe the countless technical 
means invented by man; and such an undertaking would be of 
little value. Moreover, quite enough elementary works describing 
the various techniques are already available. I shall frequently 
allude to some of these techniques on the assumption that their 
applications or their mechanics are familiar to the reader.
I do not intend to draw up a balance sheet, positive or negative, 
of what has been so far accomplished by means of these tech­
niques, or to compare their advantages and disadvantages. I shall 
not repeat what has so often been stated, that through technology 
the work week has been materially shortened, that living stand­
ards have risen, and so forth; or, on the other side of the ledger, 
that the worker has encountered many difficulties in adapting to 
the machine. Indeed, no one is capable of making a true and item­
ized account of the total effect of existing techniques. Only frag­
mentary and superficial surveys are possible.
xxxvi)
Finally, it is not my intention to make ethical or aesthetic judg* 
ments on technique. A human being is, of course, human and not 
a mere photographic plate, so that his own point of view inevitably 
appears. But this does not preclude a deeper objectivity. The sign 
of it will be that worshippers of technique will no doubt find this 
work pessimistic and haters of technique will find it optimistic.
I have attempted simply to present, by means of a comprehen­
sive analysis, a concrete and fundamental interpretation of tech­
nique.
That is the sole object of this book.

SOCIETY
CHAPTER
C O
TECHNIQUES
No social, human, or spiritual fact is so important as the fact of tech­
nique in the modem world. And yet no subject is so little under­
stood. Let us try to set up some guideposts to situate the technical 
phenomenon.
Situating the Technical Phenomenon
Machines and Technique. Whenever we see the word technology 
or technique, we automatically think of machines. Indeed, we 
commonly think of our world as a world of machines. This notion—  
which is in fact an error— is found, for example, in the works of 
Oldham and Pierre Ducassd. It arises from the fact that the ma­
chine is the most obvious, massive, and impressive example of tech­
nique, and historically the first What is called the history of tech­
nique usually amounts to no more than a history of the machine; 
this very formulation is an example of the habit of intellectuals of 
regarding forms of the present as identical with those of the past 
Technique certainly began with the machine. It is quite true 
that all the rest developed out of mechanics; it is quite true also that 
without the machine the world of technique would not exist But
4 ) TECHNIQUES
to explain the situation in this way does not at all legitimatize it. It 
is a mistake to continue with this confusion of terms, the more so 
because it leads to the idea that, because the machine is at the 
origin and center of the technical problem, one is dealing with the 
whole problem when one deals with the machine. And that is a 
greater mistake still. Technique has now become almost com­
pletely independent of the machine, which has lagged far behind 
its offspring.
It must be emphasized that, at present, technique is applied out­
side industrial life. The growth of its power today has no relation 
to the growing use of the machine. The balance seems rather to 
have shifted to the other side. It is the machine which is now en­
tirely dependent upon technique, and the machine represents only 
a small part of technique. If we were to characterize the relations 
between technique and the machine today, we could say not only 
that the machine is the result of a certain technique, but also that 
its social and economic applications are made possible by other 
technical advances. The machine is now not even the most impor­
tant aspect of technique (though it is perhaps the most spectac­
ular); technique has taken over all of man’s activities, not just his 
productive activity.
From another point of view, however, the machine is deeply 
symptomatic: it represents the ideal toward which technique 
strives. The machine is solely, exclusively, technique; it is pure 
technique, one might say. For, wherever a technical factor exists, it 
results, almost inevitably, in mechanization: technique transforms 
everything it touches into a machine.
Another relationship exists between technique and the machine, 
and this relationship penetrates to the very core of the problem of 
our civilization. It is said (and everyone agrees) that the machine 
has created an inhuman atmosphere. The machine, so characteris­
tic of the nineteenth century, made an abrupt entrance into a soci­
ety which, from the political, institutional, and human points of 
view, was not made to receive it; and man has had to put up with it 
as best he can. Men now live in conditions that are less than human. 
Consider the concentration of our great cities, the slums, the lack 
of space, of air, of time, the gloomy streets and the sallow lights 
that confuse night and day. Think of our dehumanized factories, 
our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from
The Technological Society ( 5
nature. Life in such an environment has no meaning. Consider our 
public transportation, in which man is less important than a parcel; 
our hospitals, in which he is only a number. Yet we call this prog* 
ress. . . . And the noise, that monster boring into us at every hour 
of the night without respite.
It is useless to rail against capitalism. Capitalism did not create 
our world; the machine did. Painstaking studies designed to prove 
the contrary have buried the obvious beneath tons of print. And, 
if we do not wish to play the demagogue, we must point out the 
guilty party. “The machine is antisocial,” says Lewis Mumford. "It 
tends, by reason of its progressive character, to the most acute 
forms of human exploitation.” The machine took its place in a social 
milieu that was not made for it, and for that reason created the in­
human society in which we live. Capitalism was therefore only one 
aspect of the deep disorder of the nineteenth century. To restore 
order, it was necessary to question all the bases of that society—  
its social and political structures, its art and its way of life, its com­
mercial system.
But let the machine have its head, and it topples everything that 
cannot support its enormous weight. Thus everything had to be re­
considered in terms of the machine. And that is precisely the role 
technique plays. In all fields it made an inventory of what it could 
use, of everything that could be brought into line with the ma­
chine. The machine could not integrate itself into nineteenth- 
century society; technique integrated it. Old houses that were not 
suited to the workers were tom down; and the new world tech­
nique required was built in their place. Technique has enough of 
the mechanical in its nature to enable it to cope with the machine, 
but it surpasses and transcends the machine because it remains in 
close touch with the human order. The metal monster could not 
go on forever torturing mankind. It found in technique a rule as 
hard and inflexible as itself.
Technique integrates the machine into society. It constructs the 
kind of world the machine needs and introduces order where the in­
coherent banging of machinery heaped up ruins. It clarifies, ar­
ranges, and rationalizes; it does in the domain of the abstract what 
the machine did in the domain of labor. It is efficient and brings 
efficiency to everything. Moreover, technique is sparing in the usa 
of the machine, which has traditionally been exploited to conceal
tech niques6 )
defects of organization. "Machines sanctioned social inefficiency," 
says Mumford. Technique, on the other hand, leads to a more 
rational and less indiscriminate use of machines. It places ma­
chines exactly where they ought to be and requires of them just 
what they ought to do
This brings us to two contrasting forms of social growth. Henri 
Guitton says: “Social growth was formerly reflexive or instinctive, 
that is to say, unconscious. But new circumstances (the machine) 
now compel us to recognize a kind of social development that is ra­
tional, intelligent, and conscious. We may ask ourselves whether 
this is the beginning not only of the era of a spatially finite world but 
also of the era of a conscious world.” All-embracing technique is 
in fact the consciousness of the mechanized world.
Technique integrates everything. It avoids shock and sensational 
events. Man is not adapted to a world of steel; technique adapts him 
to it. It changes the arrangement of this blind world so that man 
can be a part of it without colliding with its rough edges, without 
the anguish of being delivered up to the inhuman. Technique thus 
provides a model; it specifies attitudes that are valid once and for 
all The anxiety aroused in man by the turbulence of the machine is 
soothed by the consoling hum of a unified society.
As long as technique was represented exclusively by the ma­
chine, it was possible to speak of “man and the machine.” The ma­
chine remained an external object, and man (though significantly 
influenced by it in his professional, private, and psychic life) re­
mained none the less independent He was in a position to assert 
himself apart from the machine; he was able to adopt a position 
with respect to it.
But when technique enters into every area of life, including the 
human, it ceases to be external to man and becomes his very sub­
stance. It is no longer face to face with man but is integrated with 
him, and it progressively absorbs him. In this respect, technique is 
radically different from the machine. This transformation, so obvi­
ous in modem society, is the result of the fact that technique has 
become autonomous.
When I state that technique leads to mechanization, I am not 
refecting to the simple fact of human adaptation to the machine. Of 
course, such a process of adaptation exists, but it is caused by the ac-
The Technological Society ( 7
tion of the machine. What we are concerned with here, however, is 
a kind of mechanization in itself. If we may ascribe to the machine 
a superior form of "know-how,’*  the mechanization which results 
from technique is the application of this higher form to all domains 
hitherto foreign to the machine; we can even say that technique is 
characteristic of precisely that realm in which the machine itself 
can play no role. It is a radical error to think of technique and ma­
chine as interchangeable; from the very beginning we must be on 
guard against this misconception.
Science and Technique. Almost immediately we come up against 
a second problem. It is true that it is another pons asinorum; one 
hesitates even to mention it since the question has been so often 
discussed. The relation between science and technique is a stand­
ard subject for graduate theses— in all the trappings of nineteenth- 
century experimental science. Everyone has been taught that tech­
nique is an application of science; more particularly (science being 
pure speculation), technique figures as the point of contact between 
material reality and the scientific formula. But it also appears as 
the practical product, the application of the formulas to practical 
life.
This traditional view is radically false. It takes into account only 
a single category of science and only a short period of time: it is 
true only for the physical sciences and for the nineteenth century. It 
is not possible therefore to base a general study on it nor, as we are 
attempting to do here, an up-to-date review of the situation.
A few simple remarks suffice to destroy our confidence in these 
views. Historically, technique preceded science; even primitive man 
was acquainted with certain techniques. The first techniques of 
Hellenistic civilization were Oriental; they were not derived from 
Greek science. Thus, historically speaking, the relationship between 
science and technique ought to be reversed.
However, technique began to develop and extend itself only after 
science appeared; to progress, technique had to wait for science. 
Bertrand Gille has rightly said, in this historical perspective: "Tech­
nique, by means of repeated experiments, posed the problems, 
derived general notions and the four primary elements; but it had 
to wait for the solutions"— which science provided.
In the present era, the most casual inspection reveals an entirely
TECHNIQUES«>
different relationship. In every instance, it is clear that the border 
between technical activity and scientific activity is not at all sharply 
defined.
When we speak oi technique in historical science, we mean a cer­
tain kind of preparatory work: textual research, reading, collation, 
study of monuments, criticism, and exegesis. These represent an 
ensemble of technical operations which aim first at interpretation 
and then at historical synthesis, the true work of science. Here, 
again, technique comes first.
Even in physics, in certain instances, technique precedes science. 
The best-known example is the steam engine, a pure achievement of 
experimental genius. The sequence of inventions and improvements 
of Solomon De Caus, Christian Huygens, Denes Papin, Thomas 
Savery, and so on, rest on practical trial and error. The scientific 
explanation of the various phenomena involved was to come much 
later, after a lapse of two centuries, and even then it was not easy to 
formulate. There is still no automatic link between science and 
technique. The relation is not that simple; there is more and more 
interaction between them. Today all scientific research presupposes 
enormous technical preparation (as, for example, in atomic re­
search). And very often it is some simple technical modification 
which allows further scientific progress.
When the technical means do not exist, science does not advance. 
Michael Faraday was aware of the most recent discoveries concern­
ing the constitution of matter, but was unable to formulate precise 
theories because techniques for the production of vacua did not yet 
exist. Scientific results had to await high-vacuum techniques. The 
medical value of penicillin was discovered in 1912 by a French 
physician, but he had no technical means of producing and con. 
serving penicillin; misgivings therefore arose about the discovery 
and led to its even tual abandonment.
The majority of investigators in a laboratory are technicians who 
perform tasks far removed from what is commonly imagined to be 
scientific work. The research worker is no longer a solitary genius. 
As Robert Jungk says: “He works as a member of a team and is will­
ing to give up his freedom of research as well as personal recognition 
in exchange for the assistance and equipment a great laboratory 
offers him. These two tilings are the indispensable conditions with­
out which he cannot even dream of realizing his projects. . . .*
The Technological Society (9
Pure science seems to be yielding its place to an applied science 
which now and again reaches a brilliant peak from which new 
technical research becomes possible. Conversely, certain technical 
modifications— in airplanes, for instance— which may seem simple 
and mechanical, presuppose complex scientific work. The problem 
of reaching supersonic velocities is one. The considered opinion of 
Norbert Wiener is that the younger generation of research workers 
in the United States consists primarily of technicians who are un­
able to do research at all without the help of machines, large teams 
of men, and enormous amounts of money.
The relation between science and technique becomes even less 
clear when we consider the newer fields, which have no boundaries. 
Where does biological technique begin and where does it end? In 
modern psychology and sociology, what can we call technique, 
since in the application of these sciences everything is technique?
But it is not application which characterizes technique, for, with­
out technique (previous or concomitant), science has no way of 
existing. If we disown technique, we abandon the domain of science 
and enter into that of hypothesis and theory. In political economy 
(despite the recent efforts of economists to distinguish the bounda­
ries between science and economic technique), we shall demon­
strate that it is economic technique which forms the very substance 
of economic thought.
The established foundations have indeed been shaken. But the 
problem of these relations, in view of the enormity of the technical 
world and the reduction of the scientific, would seem to be an aca­
demic problem of interest only to philosophers— speculation with­
out content. Today it is no longer the frontiers of science which are 
at issue, but the frontiers of man; and the technical phenomenon is 
much more significant with regard to the human situation than 
with regard to the scientific. It is no longer in reference to science 
that technique must be defined. We need not pursue philosophy of 
science here, or establish, ideally or intellectually, what may be the 
relations between action and science. What we must do is look about 
us and note certain obvious things which seem to escape the all too 
intelligent philosophers.
It is not a question of minimizing the importance of scientific ac­
tivity, but of recognizing that in fact scientific activity has been 
superseded by technical activity to such a degree that we can no
TECHNIQUES10 )
longer conceive of science without its technical outcome As Charles 
Camichel has observed, the two are closer than ever before. The 
very fact that techniques advance with great rapidity demands a 
corresponding scientific advance, and sets off a general accelera­
tion.
Moreover, techniques are always put to immediate use The in­
terval which traditionally separates a scientific discovery and its 
application in everyday life has been progressively shortened As 
soon as a discovery is made, a concrete application is sought Capi­
tal becomes interested, or the state, and the discovery enters the 
public domain before anyone has had a chance to reckon all the 
consequences or to recognize its full import. The scientist might act 
more prudently; he might even be afraid to launch his carefully cal­
culated laboratory findings into the world. But how can he resist 
the pressure of the facts? How can he resist the pressure of money? 
How is he to resist success, publicity, public acclaim? Or the gen­
eral state of mind which makes technical application the last word? 
How is he to resist the desire to pursue his research? Such is the 
dilemma of the researcher today. Either he allows his findings to be 
technologically applied or he is forced to break off his research. 
Such is the drama of the atomic physicists who saw that only the 
laboratories at Los Alamos could provide them with the technical 
instruments necessary to the continuation of their work. The state, 
then, exercises a very real monopoly, and the scientist is obliged to 
accept its conditions. As one of the atomic- scientists put it: “What 
keeps me here is the possibility of using for my work a special mi­
croscope which exists nowhere else” (Jungk). The scientist is no 
longer able to hold out: “Even science, especially the magnificent 
science cf our o **vn  day, has hcuinc an nuiut-m ci lecimique, a 
mere means” (Mauss). There we have, indeed, the final word: 
science has become an instrument of technique.
Later, we shall consider how it has come about that scientific 
utilitarianism has gained such momentum from technique that a 
disinterested piece of research is no longer possible. It has always 
been necessary to have a scientific substructure, but today it is 
scarcely possible to effect a separation between scientific and techni­
cal research. Indeed, our omnivorous technique (and this repre­
sents in part Einstein’s thought) may in the end make science 
sterile.

I shall often use the term technique in place of the more com­
monly used term science, and designate as techniques work that is 
usually termed scientific. This is due to the close association of 
technique and science which I have pointed out and which I shall 
discuss more fully later on.
Organization and Technique. A third element will help us formu­
late our problem more clearly. I have already pointed out that we 
must understand the term technique in a broader sense. But some 
authors, not wishing to deviate from traditional linguistic usage, 
prefer to keep to its current meaning and seek another term to 
designate the phenomena we are describing here.
According to Arnold Toynbee, history is divided into three pe­
riods, and it is on the point of passing from the technical period 
into the period of organization. I agree with Toynbee that mechani­
cal technique no longer characterizes our times. However important 
and impressive mechanical technique remains, it is only accessory 
to other factors which are much more decisive, if less spectacular. 
I have in mind the vast amount of organization in every field, the 
recognition of which led James Burnham to write The Managerial 
Revolution.
But I cannot agree with Toynbee in his choice of terms or in the 
line he draws between the technical period and the period of or­
ganization. In his sketchy conception of technique, for which he 
has been severely criticized, the confusion between machine and 
technique remains. He has limited the realm of technique to what 
it was in the past, without considering what it is now.
In reality, what Toynbee calls organization, and Burnham calls 
managerial action, is technique applied to social, economic, or ad­
ministrative life. What but technique is the “organization” defined 
in the following? “Organization is the process which consists in 
assigning appropriate tasks to individuals or to groups so as to at­
tain, in an efficient and economic way, and by the coordination 
and combination of all their activities, the objectives agreed upon” 
(Sheldon). This leads to the standardization and the rationaliza­
tion of economic and administrative life, as Antoine Mas has well 
shown. “Standardization means resolving in advance all the prob­
lems that might possibly impede the functioning of an organization. 
It is not a matter of leaving it to inspiration, ingenuity, nor even 
intelligence to find a solution at the moment some difficulty arises;
TECHNIQUES1 3 )
it is rather in some way to anticipate both the difficulty and its 
resolution. From then on, standardization creates impersonality, in 
the sense that organization relies more on methods and instructions 
than on individuals.” We thus have all the marks of a technique. 
Organization is a technique— and Andre L. A. Vincent had good 
reason to write: "To approach the optimum combination of factors, 
or the optimum dimension is . . .  to accomplish technical prog­
ress in the form of a better organization.”
It will no doubt be asked: What is the point of discussing these 
terms, since, at bottom, you are in agreement with Toynbee? But 
these discussions are important: Toynbee separates centuries and 
phenomena which ought to remain united. He would have us be­
lieve that organization is something other than technique, that man 
has in a way discovered a new field of action and new methods, 
and that we must study organization as a new phenomenon, when 
it is nothing of the sort. I, on the other hand, insist on the con­
tinuity of the technical process. It is this process which is taking on 
a new aspect (I would say, its true aspect) and is developing on a 
world-wide scale.
What are the consequences? The first is that the problems cre­
ated by mechanical technique will be heightened to a degree as 
yet incalculable, as a result of the application of technique to ad­
ministration and to all spheres of life. Toynbee believes that this 
organization which is succeeding technique is in some way a coun­
terbalance to it, and a remedy (and that is a comforting view of 
history). But it seems to me that the exact opposite is true, that this 
development adds to the technical problems by offering a partial 
solution to old problems, itself based on the very methods that 
created the problems in the first place. This is the age-old proce­
dure of digging a new hole to fill up an old one.
A second consequence: If what we are witnessing is only an ex­
tension of the domain of technique, what was said above about 
mechanization is understandable. Toynbee writes of organization 
as a phenomenon whose effects cannot yet be seen. However, we 
can be confident that the final result will be that technique will 
assimilate everything to the machine; the ideal for which technique 
strives is the mechanization of everything it encounters. It is clear, 
therefore, that my opposition to Toynbee, even if it appears to be 
merely verbal, is significant. The technical age continues to ad*
The Technological Society ( 1 3
vance and we cannot even say that we are at the peak of its ex­
pansion. In fact, some decisive conquests remain to be made—  
man, among others— and it is hard to see what is to prevent 
technique from making them. Thus, even if this is not a question 
of a new factor, it is at least clear now what the phenomenon in­
volves and what it signifies.
Definitions. Once we stop identifying technique and machine, the 
definitions of technique we find are inadequate to the established 
facts. Marcel Mauss, the sociologist, understands the problem ad­
mirably, and has given various definitions of technique, some of 
which are excellent. Let us take one that is open to criticism and, 
by criticizing it, state our ideas more precisely: “Technique is a 
group of movements, of actions generally and mostly manual, or­
ganized, and traditional, all of which unite to reach a known end, 
for example, physical, chemical or organic.”
This definition is perfectly valid for the sociologist who deals 
with the primitive. It offers, as Mauss shows, numerous advantages. 
For example, it eliminates from the realm of techniques questions 
of religion or art (magic, however, ought to be classified among 
techniques, as we shall see later). But these advantages apply only 
in a historical perspective. In the modem perspective, this defini­
tion is insufficient.
Can it be said that the technique of elaboration of an economic 
plan ( purely a technical operation) is the result of such movements 
as Mauss describes? No particular motion or physical act is in­
volved. An economic plan is purely an intellectual operation, 
which nevertheless is a technique.
When we consider Mauss’s statement that technique is restricted 
to manual activity, the inadequacy of his definition is even more 
apparent. Today most technical operations are not manual. 
Whether machines are substituted for men, or technique becomes 
intellectual, the most important sphere in the world today (because 
in it lie the seeds of future development) is scarcely that of manual 
labor. True, manual labor is still die basis of mechanical operation, 
and we would do well to recall Jungers principal argument 
against the illusion of technical progress. He holds that the more 
technique is perfected, the more it requires secondary manual 
labor; and, furthermore, that the volume of manual operations 
increases faster than the volume of mechanical operations. This
TECHNIQUES14)
may be so, but the most important feature of techniques today is 
that they do not depend on manual labor but on organization and 
on the arrangement of machines.
I am willing to accept the term organized, as Mauss uses it in 
his definition, but I must part company with him in respect to his 
use of the term traditional. And this differentiates the technique of 
today from that of previous civilizations. It is true that in all civiliza­
tions technique has existed as tradition, that is, by the transmission 
of inherited processes that slowly ripen and are even more slowly 
modified; that evolve under the pressure of circumstances along 
with the body social; that create automatisms which become 
hereditary and are integrated into each new form of technique.
But how can anyone fail to see that none of this holds true today? 
Technique has become autonomous; it has fashioned an omnivo­
rous world which obeys its own laws and which has renounced all 
tradition. Technique no longer rests on tradition, but rather on 
previous technical procedures; and its evolution is too rapid, too 
upsetting, to integrate the older traditions. This fact, which we 
shall study at some length later on, also explains why it is not 
quite true that a technique assures a result known in advance. It 
is true if one considers only the user: the driver of an automobile 
knows that he can expect to go faster when he steps on the ac­
celerator. But even in the field of the mechanical, with the advent 
of the technique of servo-mechanisms,1  this axiom does not hold 
true. In these cases the machine itself adapts as it operates: this 
very fact makes it difficult to predict the final result of its activity. 
This becomes clear when one considers not use but technical 
progress— although, at the present time, the two are closely asso­
ciated. It is less and less exact to maintain that the user remains 
for very long in possession of a technique the results of which he 
can predict; constant invention ceaselessly upsets his habits.
Finally, Mauss appears to think that the goal attained is of a 
chemical or a physical order. But today we recognize that tech­
niques go further. Psychoanalysis and sociology have passed into 
the sphere of technical application; one example of this is propa-
1 M echanism s which involve so-called “feedback,” in which inform ation m easuring 
the degree to which an effector (e.g., an oil furance) is in error with respect to 
producing a desired value (e.g., a fixed room  temperature) is "fed back” to the 
effector by a m onitor (e.g., a thermostat). (Trans.)
The Technological Society (2 5
ganda. Here the operation is of a moral, psychic, and spiritual 
character. However, that does not prevent it from being a tech­
nique. But what we are talking about is a world once given over 
to the pragmatic approach and now being taken over by method. 
We can say, therefore, that Mauss’s definition, which was valid for 
technique until the eighteenth century, is not applicable to our 
times. In this respect Mauss has been the victim of his own socio­
logical studies of primitive people, as his classification of tech­
niques (food gathering, the making of garments, transport, etc.) 
clearly shows.
Further examples of inadequate definition are those supplied by 
Jean Fourastie and others who pursue the same line of research as 
he. For Fourastie, technical progress is “the growth of the volume 
of production obtained through a fixed quantity of raw material or 
human labor”— that is, technique is uniquely that which promotes 
this increase in yield. He then goes on to say that it is possible to 
analyze this theorem under three aspects. In yield in kind, tech­
nique is that which enables raw materials to be managed in order 
to obtain some predetermined product; in financial yield, tech­
nique is that which enables the increase in production to take place 
through the increase of capital investment; in yield of human labor, 
technique is that which increases the quantity of work produced 
by a fixed unit, of human labor. In this connection we must thank 
Fourastie for correcting Jiinger’s error—Jiinger opposes technical 
progress to economic progress because they would be, in his opin­
ion, contradictory; Fourastie shows that, on the contrary, the two 
coincide. However, we must nevertheless challenge his definition 
of technique on the ground that it is completely arbitrary.
It is arbitrary, first of all, because it is purely economic and 
contemplates only economic yield. There are innumerable tradi­
tional techniques which are not based on a quest for economic 
yield and which have no economic character. It is precisely these 
which Mauss alludes to in his definition; and they still exist. 
Among the myriad modern techniques, there are many which have 
nothing to do with economic life. Take, for example, a technique of 
mastication based on the science of nutrition, or techniques of 
sport, as in the Boy Scout movement— in these cases we can see a 
kind of yield, but this yield has little to do with economics.
In other cases, there are economic results, but these results are
I  6  ) TECHNIQUES
secondary and cannot be said to be characteristic. Take, for ex­
ample, the modem calculating machine. The solving of equations 
in seventy variables, required in certain econometric research, is 
impossible except with an electronic calculating machine. How­
ever, it is not the economic productivity which results from the 
utilization of this machine by which its importance is measured.
A second criticism of Fourasti6’s definition is that he assigns an 
exclusively productive character to technique. The growth of the 
volume of production is an even narrower concept than yield. The 
techniques which have shown the greatest development are not 
techniques of production at all. For example, techniques in the care 
of human beings (surgery, psychology, and so on) have nothing 
to do with productivity. The most modern techniques of destruc­
tion have even less to do with productivity; the atomic and hydro­
gen bombs and the Germans’ V i and V2 weapons are all examples 
of the most powerful technical creations of man’s mind. Human 
ingenuity and mechanical skill are today being exploited along 
lines which have little reference to productivity.
Nothing equals the perfection of our war machines. Warships and 
warplanes are vastly more perfect than their counterparts in ci­
vilian life. The organization of the army— its transport, supplies, 
administration— is much more precise than any civilian organiza­
tion. The smallest error in the realm of war would cost countless 
lives and would be measured in terms of victory or defeat
What is the yield there? Very poor, on the whole. Where is the 
productivity? There is none.
Vincent, in his definition, likewise refers to productivity: “Tech­
nical progress is the relative variation in world production in a 
given sphere between two given periods.” This definition, useful of 
course irom the economic point of view, leads him at once into a 
dilemma. He is obliged to distinguish technical progress from 
progress of technique (which corresponds to the progression of 
techniques in all fields) and to distinguish these two from “techni­
cal progress, properly speaking,” which concerns variations in 
productivity. This is an inference made from natural phenomena, 
for, in his definition, Vincent is obliged to recognize that technical 
progress includes natural phenomena (the greater or lesser richness 
of an ore, of the soil, etc.) by definition the very contrary of tech­
niqueI
The Technological Society ( 1 7
These linguistic acrobatics and hairsplittings suffice to prove the 
inanity of such a definition, which aims at a single aspect of techni­
cal progress and includes elements which do not belong to tech­
nique. From this definition, Vincent infers that technical progress 
is slow. But what is true of economic productivity is not true of 
technical progress in general. If one considers technique shorn of 
one whole part, and that its most progressive, one can indeed assert 
that it is slow in its progress. This abstraction is even more illusory 
when one claims to measure technical progress. The definition 
proposed by Fourastie is inexact because it excludes everything 
which does not refer to production, and all effects which are not 
economic.
This tendency to reduce the technical problem to the dimensions 
of the technique of production is also present in the works of so 
enlightened a scholar as Georges Friedmann. In his introduction to 
the UNESCO Colloquium on technique, he appears to start out 
with a very broad definition. But in the second paragraph, without 
warning, he begins to reduce everything to the level of economic 
production.
What gives rise to this limitation of the problem? One factor 
might be a tacit optimism, a need to hold that technical progress 
is unconditionally valid— which leads to the selection of the most 
positive aspect of technical progress, as though it were its only one.
This may have guided Fourastie, but it does not seem to hold 
true in Friedmann’s case. I believe that the reasoning behind Fried­
mann’s way of thinking is to be found in the turn of the scientific 
mind. All aspects— mechanical, economic, psychological, socio­
logical— of the techniques of production have been subjected to 
innumerable specialized studies; as a result, we are beginning to 
learn in a more precise and scientific way about the relationships 
between man and the industrial machine. Since the scientist must 
use the materials he has at hand; and since almost nothing is known 
about the relationship of man to the automobile, the telephone, or 
the radio, and absolutely nothing about the relationship of man to 
the Apparat or about the sociological effects of other aspects of 
technique, the scientist moves unconsciously toward the sphere of 
what is known scientifically, and tries to limit the whole question 
to that.
There is another element in this scientific attitude: only that is
TECHNIQUES18)
knowable which is expressed (or, at least, can be expressed) in 
numbers. To get away from the so-called “arbitrary and subjec­
tive,” to escape ethical or literary judgments (which, as everyone 
knows, are trivial and unfounded), the scientist must get back to 
numbers. What, after all, can one hope to deduce from the purely 
qualitative statement that the worker is fatigued? But when bio­
chemistry makes it possible to measure fatigability numerically, it 
is at last possible to take account of the worker’s fatigue. Then 
there is hope of finding a solution. However, an entire realm of 
effects of technique— indeed, the largest— is not reducible to num­
bers; and it is precisely that realm which we are investigating in 
this work. Yet, since what can be said about it is apparently not 
to be taken seriously, it is better for the scientist to shut his eyes 
and regard it as a realm of pseudo-problems, or simply as non­
existent. The “scientific” position frequently consists of denying 
the existence of whatever does not belong to current scientific 
method. The problem of the industrial machine, however, is a 
numerical one in nearly all its aspects. Hence, all of technique is 
unintentionally reduced to a numerical question. In the case of 
Vincent, this is intentional, as his definition shows; “We embrace in 
technical progress all kinds of progress . . . provided that they 
are treatable numerically in a reliable way.”
H. D. Lasswell’s definition of technique as “the ensemble of prac­
tices by which one uses available resources in order to achieve 
certain valued ends” also seems to follow the conventions cited 
above, and to embrace only industrial technique. Here it might be 
contested whether technique does indeed permit the realization 
of values. However, to judge from Lasswell’s examples, he con­
ceives the terms of his definition in an extremely broad manner. 
He gives a list of values and the corresponding techniques. As 
values, for example, he lists riches, power, well-beihg, affection; 
and as techniques, the techniques of government, production, 
medicine, the family, and so on. Lasswell’s conception of value 
may seem somewhat strange; the term is obviously not apt. But 
what he has to say indicates that he gives techniques their full 
scope. Moreover, he makes it quite clear that it is necessary to 
show the effects of technique not only on inanimate objects but 
also on people. I am, therefore, in substantial agreement with this 
conception.

Technical Operation and Technical Phenomenon. With the use 
of these few guideposts, we can now try to formulate, if not a full 
definition, at least an approximate definition of technique. But we 
must keep this in mind: we are not concerned with the different in­
dividual techniques. Everyone practices a particular technique, 
and it is difficult to come to know them all. Yet in this great di­
versity we can find certain points in common, certain tendencies 
and principles shared by them all. It is clumsy to call these common 
features Technique with a capital T; no one would recognize his 
particular technique behind this terminology. Nevertheless, it takes 
account of a reality— the technical phenomenon— which is world­
wide today.
If we recognize that the method each person employs to attain 
a result is in fact, his particular technique, the problem of means 
is raised. In fact, technique is nothing more than means and the 
ensemble of means. This, of course, does not lessen the importance 
of the problem. Our civilization is first and foremost a civilization 
of means; in the reality of modern life, the means, it would seem, 
are more important than the ends. Any other assessment of the 
situation is mere idealism.
Techniques considered as methods of operation present certain 
common characteristics and certain general tendencies, but we 
cannot devote ourselves exclusively to them. To do this would lead 
to a more specialized study than I have in mind. The technical 
phenomenon is much more complex than any synthesis of char­
acteristics common to individual techniques. If we desire to come 
closer to a definition of technique, we must in fact differentiate 
between the technical operation and the technical phenomenon.
The technical operation includes every operation carried out in 
accordance with a certain method in order to attaiii a particular 
end. It can be as rudimentary as splintering a flint or as compli­
cated as programming an electronic brain. In every case, it is the 
method which characterizes the operation. It may be more or less 
effective or more or less complex, but its nature is always the same. 
It is this which leads us to think that there is a continuity in techni­
cal operations and that only the great refinement resulting from 
scientific progress differentiates the modern technical operation 
from the primitive one.
Every operation obviously entails a certain technique, even the
TECHNIQUES2 0 )
gathering of fruit among primitive peoples— climbing the tree, 
picking the fruit as quickly and with as little effort as possible, dis­
tinguishing between the ripe and the unripe fruit, and so on. How­
ever, what characterizes technical action within a particular ac­
tivity is the search for greater efficiency. Completely natural and 
spontaneous effort is replaced by a complex of acts designed to im­
prove, say, the yield. It is this which prompts the creation of tech­
nical forms, starting from simple forms of activity. These technical 
forms are not necessarily more complicated than the spontaneous 
ones, but they are more efficient and better adapted.
Thus, technique creates means, but the technical operation still- 
occurs on the same level as that of the worker who does the work. 
The skilled work'er, like the primitive huntsman, remains a techni­
cal operator; their attitudes differ only to a small degree.
But two factors enter into the extensive field of technical opera­
tion: consciousness and judgment. This double intervention pro­
duces what I call the technical phenomenon. What characterizes 
this double intervention? Essentially, it takes what was previously 
tentative, unconscious, and spontaneous and brings it into the 
realm of clear, voluntary, and reasoned concepts.
When Andre Leroi-Gourhan tabulates the efficiency of Zulu 
swords and arrows in terms of the most up-to-date knowledge of 
weaponry, he is doing work that is obviously different from that of 
the swordsmith of Bechuanaland who created the form of the 
sword. The swordsmith’s choice of form was unconscious and 
spontaneous; although it can now be justified by numerical calcu­
lations, such calculations had no place whatever in the technical 
operation he performed. But reason did, inevitably, enter into the 
process because man spontaneously imitates nature in his activi­
ties. Accomplishments that merely copy nature, however, have no 
future (for instance, the imitation of birds’ wings from Icarus to 
Ader). Reason makes it possible to produce objects in terms of 
certain features, certain abstract requirements; and this in turn 
leads, not to the imitation of nature, but to the ways of technique.
The intervention of rational judgment in the technical operation 
has important consequences. Man becomes aware that it is possible 
to find new and different means. Reason upsets pragmatic tradi­
tions and creates new operational methods and new tools; it 
examines rationally the possibilities of more extensive and less rigid
The Technological Society ( s i
experimentation. Reason in these ways multiplies technical opera­
tions to a high degree of diversity. But it also operates in the op­
posite direction: it considers results and takes account of the fixed 
end of technique— efficiency. It notes what every means devised 
is capable of accomplishing and selects from the various means at 
its disposal with a view to securing the ones that are the most 
efficient, the best adapted to the desired end. Thus the multiplicity 
of means is reduced to one: the most efficient And here reason 
appears clearly in the guise of technique.
In addition, there is the intervention of consciousness. Conscious­
ness shows clearly, and to everybody, the advantages of technique 
and what it can accomplish. The technician takes stock of alterna­
tive possibilities. The immediate result is that he seeks to apply 
the new methods in fields which traditionally had been left to 
chance, pragmatism, and instinct. The intervention of conscious­
ness causes a rapid and far-flung extension of technique.
The twofold intervention of reason and consciousness in the 
technical world, which produces the technical phenomenon, can 
be described as the quest of the one best means in every field. And 
this “one best means’*  is, in fact, the technical means. It is the 
aggregate of these means that produces technical civilization.
The technical phenomenon is the main preoccupation of our 
time; in every field men seek to find the most efficient method. But 
our investigations have reached a limit. It is no longer the best 
relative means which counts, as compared to other means also in 
use. The choice is less and less a subjective one among several 
means which are potentially applicable. It is really a question of 
finding the best means in the absolute sense, on the basis of nu­
merical calculation.
It is, then, the specialist who chooses the means; he is able to 
carry out the calculations that demonstrate the superiority of the 
means chosen over all others. Thus a science of means comes into 
being— a science of techniques, progressively elaborated.
This science extends to greatly diverse areas; it ranges from the act 
of shaving to the act of organizing the landing in Normandy, or to 
cremating thousands of deportees. Today no human activity es­
capes this technical imperative. There is a technique of organiza- 
ticsi (the great fact of organization described by Toynbee fits very 
well into this conception of the technical phenomenon), just as
22  ) TECHNIQUES
there is a technique of friendship and a technique of swimming. 
Under the circumstances, it is easy to see how far we are from 
confusing technique and machine. And, if we examine the broader 
areas where this search for means is taking place, we find three 
principal subdivisions of modem technique, in addition to the 
mechanical (which is the most conspicuous but which I shall 
not discuss because it is so well known) and to the forms of in­
tellectual technique (card indices, libraries, and so on).
l)  Economic technique is almost entirely subordinated to pro­
duction, and ranges from the organization of labor to economic 
planning. This technique differs from the others in its object and 
goal But its problems are the same as those of all other technical 
activities.
z) The technique of organization concerns the great masses and 
applies not only to commercial or industrial affairs of magnitude 
(coming, consequently, under the jurisdiction of the economic) but 
abo to states and to administration and police power. This organi­
zational technique is also applied to warfare and insures the power 
of an army at least as much as its weapons. Everything in the 
legal field also depends on organizational technique.
3 ) Human technique takes various forms, ranging all the way 
from medicine and genetics to propaganda (pedagogical tech­
niques, vocational guidance, publicity, etc.). Here man himself be­
comes the object of technique.
We observe, in the case of each of these subdivisions, that the 
subordinate techniques may be very different in kind and not 
necessarily similar one to another as techniques. They have the 
same goal and preoccupation, however, and are thus related. The 
three subdivisions show the wide extent of the technical phenome 
non. In fact, nothing at all escapes technique today. There is no 
field where technique is not dominant— this is easy to say and is 
scarcely surprising. We are so habituated to machines that there 
seems to be nothing left to discover.
Has the fact of technique no intrinsic importance? Does it spring 
merely from the march of time? Or does it represent a problem pe­
culiar to our times? Our discussion of the biology of technique will 
bring us face to face with this question. But first we must survey in 
detail the vast field which the technical phenomenon covers, in 
order to become fully cognizant of what it signifies.

Historical Development
Primitive Technique. It is scarcely possible to give here a his­
tory of technique in its universal aspect, as we have just defined it 
We are only now beginning to know a little of the history of me­
chanical technique. It is enough to recall the works of Andre 
Leroi-Gourhan, Richard Lefebvre des Noettes, Marc Bloch, and 
others. But the full history of technique has yet to be written. My 
book is not a history. I shall speak in a historical vein only when it is 
necessary to the understanding of the technical problem in soci­
ety today.
Technical activity is the most primitive activity of man. There is 
the technique of hunting, of fishing, of food gathering; and later of 
weapons, clothing, and building. And here we face a mystery. 
What is the origin of this activity? It is a phenomenon which ad­
mits of no complete explanation. By patient research, one finds 
areas of imitation, transitions from one technical form to another, 
examples of penetration. But at the core there is a closed area—  
the phenomenon of invention.
It can be shown that technique is absorbed into man’s psychol­
ogy and depends upon that psychology and upon what has been 
called technical motivation. But we have no explanation of how an 
activity which once did not exist came to be.
How did man come to domesticate animals, to choose certain 
plants to cultivate? The motivating force, we are told, was 
religious,2  and the first plants were cultivated with some magical 
end in mind. This is likely, but how was the selection made? And 
how did it happen that the majority of these plants were edible? 
How did man come to refine metals and make bronze? Was it 
chance, as the legend of the discovery of Phoenician glass has it? 
This is obviously not the answer.
One is left with an enigma; and there is some point in emphasiz­
ing that there is here the same mysterious quality as in the appear­
ance of life itself. Each primitive operation of man implies the 
bridging of such an enormous gulf between instinct and the techni-
7 See, for exam ple, Pierre Deffootaines'i Geographic dct religiont.
TECHNIQUES* 4 )
cal act that a mystic aura hovers about all subsequent develop­
ment. Our modern worship of technique derives from man’s 
ancestral worship of the mysterious and marvelous character of 
his own handiwork.
It has not been sufficiently emphasized that technique has 
evolved along two distinct paths. There is the concrete 
technique of homo faber— man the maker— to which we are 
accustomed, and which poses the problems we have normally 
studied. There is also the technique, of a more or less spiritual 
order, which we call magic.
It may seem questionable; nevertheless, magic is a technique 
in the strictest sense of the word, as has been clearly demonstrated 
by Marcel Mauss. Magic developed along with other techniques as 
an expression of man’s will to obtain certain results of a spiritual 
order. To attain them, man made use of an aggregate of rites, 
formulas, and procedures which, once established, do not vary. 
Strict adherence to form is one of the characteristics of magic: 
forms and rituals, masks which never vary, the same kind of prayer 
wheels, the same ingredients for mystical drugs, for formulae for 
divination, and so on. All these became set and were passed on: 
the slightest variation in word or gesture would alter the magical 
equilibrium.
There is a relationship between the ready-made formula and a 
precise result. The gods being propitiated obey such an invocation 
out of necessity; all the more reason that they be given no oppor­
tunity to escape compliance because the invocation is not correctly 
formulated. This fixity is a manifestation of the technical character 
of magic: when the best possible means of obtaining the desired 
result has been found, why change it? Every magical means, in 
the eyes of the person who uses it, is the most efficient one.
In the spiritual realm, magic displays all the characteristics 
of a technique. It is a mediator between man and ‘ the higher 
powers,” just as other techniques mediate between man and matter. 
It leads to efficacy because it subordinates the power of the gods 
to men, and it secures a predetermined result. It affirms human 
power in that it seeks to subordinate the gods to men, just as tech­
nique serves to cause nature to obey.
Magic clearly displays the characteristics of primitive technique, 
as Leroi-Gourhan indicates when he says that technique is a
The Technological Society (3 5
cloak for man, a kind of cosmic vestment. In his conflict with mat­
ter, in his struggle to survive, man interposes an intermediary 
agency between himself and his environment, and this agency has 
a twofold function. It is a means of protection and defense: alone 
man is too weak to defend himself. It is also a means of assimilation: 
through technique, man is able to utilize to his profit powers 
that are alien or hostile. He is able to manipulate his surroundings 
so that they are no longer merely his surroundings but become a 
factor of equilibr-ktm'and of profit to him. Thus, as a result of tech­
nique' man transforms his adversaries into allies.
These characteristics of material technique correspond perfectly 
to the characteristics of magical technique. There, also, man is in 
conflict with external forces, with the world of mystery, spiritual 
powers, and mystical currents. But there, too, man erects a 
barrier around himself, for he would not know how to defend him­
self by his own unaided intellect He uses any means that will 
serve him both for defense and for adjustment. He turns to his 
own profit the hostile powers, which are obliged to obey him by 
virtue of his magical formulas. Masson-Oursel, in a recent study, 
confirms this. He shows that magic is basically a “scholasticism of 
efficiency” which man employs as an instrument against his en­
vironment; that magic is pragmatic, yet has a precision that must 
be called objective; and that its efficiency is demonstrated only in 
certain “consecrations or disqualifications.” Masson-Oursel rightly 
believes that magic preceded technique— in fact, that magic is the 
first expression of technique.
Plainly, we have had two streams of technique from the very be­
ginning. How does it happen that we never take cognizance of the 
second? There are a number of reasons. We can leave aside the 
causes that come from modem psychology. Because we are ob­
sessed with materialism and do not take magic seriously, it has 
little interest for us, and we are unaware even today, as we study 
technique— the techniques that relate to men— that we are draw­
ing on the great stream of magical techniques.
But this neglect is due as well to objective causes: in relation to 
purely material factors, it has been demonstrated that every milieu 
resists imitating the techniques of another social or ethnic group. 
Surely, this resistance was much stronger in the realm of magical 
techniques. Here were all the taboos and prohibitions, the im-
TECHNIQUE*2 6 )
mense strength of magical conservatism. Then, too, whereas ma­
terial techniques are relatively distinct and independent of one 
another, magical techniques are rapidly elaborated into a rigid 
system. Everything is of a piece, everything is dependent upon 
everything else; consequently, nothing can be meddled with, noth­
ing modified without threat to the whole structure of beliefs and 
activities. Hence, their weak expansive power and their strong 
power of defense against alien magical techniques.
The realm of magical practice is limited, and there is little or no 
diffusion. Propagation begins with “spiritualist” religions which are 
not bound to special magical rites. There is, then, no possibility of 
choice between different rival magical techniques; yet expansion 
and choice are decisive factors in technical progress. There is no 
real progress in the realm of magic; here lies its fundamental dif­
ference. There is no progress in space, no progress in time; indeed, 
the tendency of magic is to regress. And because magical technique 
is tied to one ethnic group, to one given form of civilization, it dis­
appears completely when that group or civilization disappears.
When a civilization dies, it transmits to its heirs its material but 
not its spiritual apparatus. Tools, houses, and methods of manu­
facture live on and, more or less reincarnated, are to be met with 
again. There may be a temporary material regression in periods of 
great destruction, but the lost ground is recovered, as if a collective 
historical memory made possible the recovery of what had been 
lost several generations before. But magical techniques, rites, for­
mulas, and sacrificial practices disappear irremediably. The new 
civilization will fashion its own new stock of magic, which has 
little in common with the old. Only a set of generalizations so broad 
as to mean nothing, and overhasty analogies, create the belief that 
magical forms are perpetuated and renewed. Indeed, they five on 
only in the minds of the “initiates” and not in any human or social 
reality.
Consequently, a magical technique that is not passed on in 
time or space does not follow the same evolutionary curve as ma­
terial technique. There is not a progression of discoveries built 
one upon the other; rather, discoveries remain side by side and do 
not affect one another.
There is another factor in the regression of magical techniques: 
the problem of evidence. In material techniques, choice is relatively
The Technological Society ( 2 7
simple. Since every technique is subordinate to its immediate result, 
it is only a question of choosing the one that produces the most 
satisfactory result; and, in the material domain, that result can 
readily be seen. That one form of axe is superior to another is a 
judgment not beyond a normal man (in spite of the extreme diffi­
culty primitive man experienced when faced with such a choice). 
But with magical techniques the same certainty or force of evi­
dence does not exist. Who can judge their relative efficiency? 
Magical efficiency is not always to be measured by a clear material 
result such as making rain fall, but may have to do with some 
purely spiritual phenomena or even with material phenomena 
over a long period of time. Here matters are not clear nor the choice 
easy; the difficulty becomes even more acute when we think about 
the uncertainty of the reasons for failure. Was the magical tech­
nique really inefficient? Or was the one who used it incompetent? 
The common reaction is to blame the magician rather than the 
technique, and here again we see an element of immobility in 
magic.
The two great streams of technique which we have traced from 
their beginnings evolved in completely different ways. In manual 
technique we observe an increase and later a multiplication of dis­
coveries, each based on the other. In magic we see only endless 
new beginnings, as the fortunes of history and its own inefficiency 
call its procedures into question.
Explanation becomes even more difficult when we note that in 
the magical domain too our own era has achieved an overwhelming 
superiority; our magical techniques have become really effective. 
These techniques obviously must not be confused with religious 
life or anything of that kind. This is purely a social phenomenon, 
both in aim and in form. However, the two aspects of technique, 
although both are social, are sharply separated, and would seem 
to have interacted very little anywhere.
Greece. Technique is essentially Oriental: it was principally in the 
Near East that technique first developed, and it had very little 
in the way of scientific foundation. It was entirely directed toward 
practical application and was not concerned with general theories, 
which alone can give rise to scientific movements. This predomi­
nance of technique in the East points up an error which is found 
throughout Western thought: that the Oriental mind is turned
* 8 )  TECHNIQUES
toward the mystical and has no interest in concrete action, whereas 
the Western mind is oriented toward "know-how' and action, and 
hence toward technique. In fact, the East was the cradle of all 
action, of all past and primitive technique in the present sense of 
the word, and later of spiritual and magical technique as well.
The Greeks, however, were the first to have a coherent scientific 
activity and to liberate scientific thought. But then a phenomenon 
occurred which still astonishes historians: the almost total separa­
tion of science and technique. Doubtless, this separation was less 
absolute than the example of Archimedes has led historians to 
believe. But it is certain that material needs were treated with con­
tempt, that technical research was considered unworthy of the in­
tellect, and that the goal of science was not application but con­
templation. Plato shunned any compromise with application, even 
in order to forward scientific research. For him, only the most ab­
stract possible exercise of reason was important. Archimedes went 
even further. True, he rationalized practice and even made “appli­
cations' to a certain degree; but his machine was to be destroyed 
after it had demonstrated the exactness of his numerical reckon­
ings.
Why did the Greeks adopt this Malthusian attitude toward ac­
tivity? There are two possible answers: either they were not willing 
or they were not able. And it is likely that both are true. Abel Rey 
has devoted the fifth volume of his Science Technique to the 
Greeks. According to him, Greece in her decline became “in­
capable of sustaining the ideal of hard, disinterested labor (the 
ideal of an essentially contemplative intelligence disdainful of all 
utility). She then fell back on the techniques of the East She 
was involved in them by her own techniques, for she had none the 
less sought to satisfy men’s vital needs, in spite of the contempt in 
which she held them.” Confronted with technical necessity, Greece 
lost her inventive genius and turned to Eastern technique. She did 
not know, says Abel Rey, how to find the bridge between “know­
how” and “know-why.”
This is true for the period of decadence, the second and first 
centuries b.c., but it does not seem to be the case in the preceding 
period; in the fifth century B .C ., Greece experienced rapid technical 
development, although later it came to an abrupt halt.
In their golden age of science, the Greeks could have deduced
The Technological Society ( s$
the technical consequences of their scientific activity. But they did 
not wish to. Walter asks: “Did the Creeks, obsessed with harmony, 
check themselves at the very point at which inquiry ran the risk of 
going to excess and threatened to introduce a monstrosity into their 
civilization?"
This was the result of a variety of factors, most of which were of 
a philosophic nature. For one thing, theirs was a conception of life 
which scorned material needs and the improvement of practical 
life, discredited manual labor (because of the practice of slavery), 
held contemplation to be the goal of intellectual activity, refused 
the use of power, respected natural things. The Greeks were 
suspicious of technical activity because it represented an aspect of 
brute force and implied a want of moderation. Man, however 
humble his technical equipment, has from the very beginning 
played the role of sorcerer’s apprentice in relation to the machine. 
This feeling on the part of the Greeks was not a reflection of a 
primitive man’s fear in the face of something he does not under* 
stand (the explanation given today when certain persons take fright 
at our techniques). Rather, it was the result, perfectly mastered 
and perfectly measured, of a certain conception of life. It repre* 
sented an apex of civilization and intelligence.
Here we find the supreme Greek virtue, iyp&r<t* (self-control). 
The rejection of technique was a deliberate, positive activity in­
volving self-mastery, recognition of destiny, and the application of 
a given conception of life. Only the most modest techniques were 
permitted— those which would respond directly to material needs 
in such a way that these needs did not get the upper hand.
In Greece a conscious effort was made to economize on means 
and to reduce the sphere of influence of technique. No one sought 
to apply scientific thought technically, because scientific thought 
corresponded to a conception of life, to wisdom. The great pie- 
occupation of the Greeks was balance, harmony and moderation; 
hence, they fiercely resisted the unrestrained force inherent in 
technique, and rejected it because of its potentialities. For these 
same reasons, magic had relatively little importance in Greece. 
Rome. Social technique was still in its infancy. Doubtless, there 
had been some attempts at social organization— those of certain 
Pharaohs, and those of the Persian empire, were not neglibible. 
But such organizations could be maintained only by police power.
TECHNIQUES3 ° )
whereas the exact opposite is true of genuine social organization. 
By the very fact of its existence, coercion demonstrates the ab­
sence of political, administrative, and juridical technique; for this 
reason the great empires of the past are of little importance to our 
study. Correlatively, an army (even the army of the Chaldeans, 
who advanced the art of war furthest) was a fairly inorganic crew 
whose aim was pillage and which applied no social technique. The 
army of Alexander made use of genuine strategy, but this was al­
most exclusively military and had no sociological foundations or 
attributes. It was the expression not of a people but of a state— and 
therefore lacked the substance necessary to technique.
In Rome, however, we pass on, at one step, to the perfection of 
social technique, both civil and military. Everything in Roman so­
ciety was related to Roman law in its multiple forms, both public 
and private.
To characterize the technique of this law in the period during 
which it flourished (from the second century b.c. to the second 
century a.d.), we can say first of all that it was not the fruit of ab­
stract thought, but rather of an exact view of the concrete situation, 
which the Romans attempted to turn to account with the fewest 
possible means. This realism respected justice and acknowledged 
history and necessity. From this concrete, experimental view, 
which the Romans held consciously, their administrative and judi­
cial technique developed. And a kind of discipline appeared: the 
use of a minimum of means. This discipline, which probably had 
its foundations in religion, is one of the secrets of the whole de­
velopment To the degree that the Roman had to respond to neces­
sity, and at the same time not permit himself excessive luxury, it 
was necessary to refinp every means, to bring it to perfection, to 
exploit it in every possible way, and to give it free rein, without 
shackling it with exceptions and secondary rules. No social situa­
tion developed which did not immediately find its response in or­
ganization. Nor could this response be the creation of a new means, 
but rather the perfection of an old means. Indeed, the proliferation 
of means is thought even today to denote technological weakness.
A second element in the Roman development of organization 
was the search for an equilibrium between the purely technical 
factor and the human factor. Judicial technique did not begin as a 
substitute for man. In Roman judicial technique there was no
The Technological Society (3 1
question of eliminating initiative and responsibility, but rather of 
allowing them to operate and to assert themselves. It was not until 
the third century a.d. that judicial technique attempted to deal 
with the details of life, to regulate everything, to foresee everything, 
thereby leaving the individual in a state of complete inertia. But 
the great judicial era of Rome was one of equilibrium: the law 
laid down the framework and supplied the means that men could 
use in following their own initiative. Of course, this presupposed 
a civic sense corresponding to the technical conception. The 
equilibrium between the two was evident in the system of pro­
cedure we call bureaucracy; in it is found, with an almost dis­
concerting simplicity, the perfect type of procedure. And there we 
find that one of the conditions of technique is respect for the in- 
dividual, who is not yet considered apart from society.
A third characteristic of Roman technique was that it was di­
rected toward a precise end: the internal coherence of society. This 
technique was not self-justifying, it did not have as its raison d’etre 
its own self-development, and it was not imposed from the out­
side. It was not a kind of scaffolding which held independent ele­
ments together; it sought rather to promote cohesion. The founda­
tion of society was not the police; it was an organization which 
enabled society to make the least possible use of the police. A 
wide variety of techniques— religious, administrative, and finan­
cial— were obviously needed to execute this design, but in no case 
was there recourse to force. When it appeared that the state 
would be compelled to use force, the organizational sense of the 
Romans led them to abandon a given project rather than attempt 
to maintain it by force. Force is never economical, and Rome was 
economical in all things.
This social coherence was the first judicial technique the world 
had knowa It was also the basis for the Roman military system, 
which was a direct expression of civil society in that it had the same 
respect for efficiency and economy. From it came the development 
of organs of transport, food supply, and so on; and the Roman con­
ception of mass strategy and their refusal to create heroes: combat 
was thus reduced to its most utilitarian level.
A fourth element was continuity. The judicial technique of the 
Romans was constantly being readapted in accordance with a his­
torical plan. It involved a policy of watchful waiting while circum-
3 * )  TECHNIQUES
stances were not propitious, at the same time making preparations 
for the right moment, and when that moment came, carrying out 
the plan decisively.
As regards material techniques, the Romans did not develop 
them as brilliantly. From the fourth to the first century b.c., and 
after the second century a.d., there was almost total stagnation—  
tools and armaments no longer evolved. But from the first century 
b.c. to the first century a.d., a technical revival took place. Practical 
necessity (on the economic and military levels and with regard to 
transport) was met by the production of animal-powered ma­
chines (forges, water wheels, pumps, plows, the screw press, 
cord-operated ballistic engines, etc.).
The Romans possessed a remarkable understanding of applica­
bility. Their judicial system could be applied always and every­
where (in the Empire); it was adapted to an unfailing continuity. 
And these were totally new phenomena which Rome introduced. 
Later, Rome was allowed to drift into a technical vertigo; the end 
was near.
Christianity and Technique. The East: passive, fatalist, contemptu­
ous of life and action; the West: active, conquering, turning nature 
to profit. These contrasts, so dear to popular sociology, are said 
to result from a difference in religion: Buddhism and Islam on the 
one hand; on the other, Christianity, which is credited with having 
forged the practical soul of the West.
These ideas are hardly beyond the level of the rote repetitions 
found even in the works of serious historians. It is not for me to 
examine religious doctrines in themselves or as absolute if unreal­
ized dogma, but rather to interpret them sociologically. After all, I 
am not writing theology; I am writing history. And there is a world 
of difference between dogma and its sociological application. (I 
shall not touch upon the personal interpretation of religion, which 
concerns the relationship between the individual and God.)
This being the case, it is obvious that certain statements call for 
modification. For example, the assertion that as a consequence of 
the teachings of Mohammed, the Islamic conquests of the seventh 
century are evidence of passivism. This might also be said of the 
determined Islamic resistance to Western encroachments during 
the last two centuries. We attribute to Buddhist indifferentism the 
remarkable artistic, political, and military development in India

from the second to the fifth century. In fact, however, these civili­
zations were little advanced technically, though they had de­
veloped in many other areas.
Christianity in Russia, on the other hand, gave rise to a mystical 
civilization which was indifferent to material life and had no 
technical drive and no interest in economic exploitation. “Ah, yesl” 
is the reply. “But Christianity in Russia had Eastern overtones . . .” 
Here, then, indifference to technique would appear to be a ques­
tion of temperament and not of religion.
Another embarrassing fact: when in her decline Greece applied 
herself to technical inquiry and the development of industry, she 
looked to the East for methods. And in the first century, when 
Rome— the perfect example of the technical spirit in antiquity—  
took up industry, she too turned to the East for industrial tech­
niques— the refining of silver and gold, glassmaking, the tempering 
of weapons, pottery, ship construction, and so on. All these tech­
niques came to Rome from the East, either early, through the 
Etruscans, or much later, after the conquests. We are far indeed 
from being able to support this traditional cleavage between East 
and West. In fact, during classical antiquity it was the East which 
possessed the concrete, inventive mind that gTasps the truth and 
exploits i t
The West is making a prodigious advance in technique at the 
present, and the West is traditionally Christian. Nor can it be main­
tained that Christianity is a negligible factor in that advance. How­
ever, there were several distinct historical periods in the West The 
West was officially Christian until the fourteenth century; there­
after, Christianity became controversial and was breached by other 
influences. What do we find, from a technical standpoint, in the 
so-called Christian era, the period from the fourth to the fourteenth 
centuries, the “sociological moment”? First, we observe the break­
down of Roman technique in every area— on the level of organiza­
tion as well as in the construction of cities, in industry, and in 
transport From the fourth to the tenth centuries, in fact, there was 
a complete obliteration of technique, a condition so deplored that 
it became a focus of anti-Christian polemic, and rightly so. It was 
because the Christians held judicial and other technical activity in 
such contempt that they were considered the “enemies of the hu­
man race”— and not only because they opposed Caesar. The re-
TECHNIQUES3 4 )
proach of Celsus was not without truth. After the Christian triumph 
in Rome, there was not one great jurist left who could guarantee 
the life and the value of the Roman organization. Decadence? No 
— complete disinterest in such activity. Saint Augustine devoted 
much of his De Civitate Dei to justifying the Christians in this 
respect, and to denying that their influence was detrimental. "They 
are good citizens," he proclaimed. That may have been so, but 
their focus of interest was nevertheless on something other than 
the state and practical activity. I shall show later on that the 
technical state of mind is one of the principal causes of technical 
progress.
It is not a coincidence that Rome declined as Christianity tri­
umphed. The Emperor Julian was certainly justified in accusing 
the Christians of ruining the industry of the Empire.
After this period of decadence (for which, of course, Christianity 
was not solely responsible), what does the historian find? The res­
toration, under Christian influence, of an active civilization—  
methodical, exploiting the riches of the world as a gift given by 
God to be put to good use? Not at alL The society which developed 
from the tenth to the fourteenth century was vital, coherent, and 
unanimous; but it was characterized by a total absence of the tech­
nical will. It was “a-capitalistic” as well as “a-technical.”
From the point of view of organization, it was an anarchy in the 
etymological sense of the word— and it was completely nontechni­
cal. Its law was principally based on custom. It had no social or 
political organization based on reasoned, elaborated rules. In all 
other areas— for example, in agriculture and industry— there was 
the same nearly total absence of technique. This was also true with 
regard to the military,, the principal activity of the time. Combat 
was reduced to its most elementary— to charging in a straight line 
and to hand-to-hand engagement. Only architectural technique 
developed and asserted itself; but this was prompted not by a 
technical state of mind but by religious impulse.
Little effort was made to improve agricultural or industrial prac­
tices. There was no effort at useful creation— evidence of the re­
markable practical genius of the Christian religion! And when at 
the beginning of the twelfth century, at first very feebly a technical 
movement began to take form, it developed under the influence of 
the East.
The Technological Society (3  5
The technical impetus of our civilization came from the East, at 
first through the intermediacy of the Judaei’ and the Venetians, 
and later through the Crusades. But even so, it limited itself to 
imitating what it had seen— except in art Certain autonomous dis­
coveries did take place, especially as a result of commercial neces­
sity; but this development was no more intense than it had been 
under the Roman Empire.
In fact, the Middle Ages created only one new, complete tech­
nique, an intellectual technique, a mode of reasoning: scholasti­
cism. The very name evokes its mediocrity. With its gigantic ap­
paratus, it was in the end nothing but an extremely cumbersome 
formalism; it wandered for centuries in intellectual blind alleys, 
notwithstanding the prodigious intellects of the men who used it 
and were deformed by i t  The halance sheet shows no triumphs, 
even on the historical plane.
The technical movement of the West developed in a world which 
had already withdrawn from the dominant influence of Christian­
ity. A point can doubtless be made of the effects of the Reformation, 
but the economic consequences of this movement have been singu­
larly exaggerated. In any case, this is not the place to take up this 
question.
Although, practically speaking, it seems clear that Christianity 
was scarcely an important cause of technical progress (not to men­
tion regression), it is nevertheless customary to hold that Chris­
tianity, from the theological point of view, paved the way for 
technical development.
Let us consider the two arguments advanced for this point of 
view. First, and most important, it is held that Christianity sup­
pressed slavery, the great obstacle to technical development. The 
moment men are free, they supposedly tum toward technique to be 
delivered from the misery of labor. Slavery was thus a hindrance 
to technique because no attempt was made either to relieve the 
miserable condition of the slave or to replace him by some other 
motive force. The second argument is more intelligent: that an­
tiquity was possessed of a holy fear of nature, and dared not lay 
hand on the secrets which to the ancients were gods. They dared 
not make use of natural forces, which for them were supernatural.
A  particular kind o f trader. (Trans.)
TECHNIQUES36)
Christianity secularized nature: with Christianity nature once 
again became simply nature and no one scrupled to exploit it. 
Unfortunately, however, neither of these arguments is quite ac- 
curate.
There was in fact greater technical progress in civilizations where 
slavery was prevalent ( for example, Egypt) than in others where 
that institution was practically unknown (for example, Israel). 
There was greater technical progress in the slaveholding period of 
Roman history than in the period when slaves were freed whole­
sale. And the liberation of the slaves during the era of the barbarian 
invasions produced no technical improvement, even at long term; 
almost seven centuries elapsed between the suppression of slavery 
and the beginning of even a feeble technical advance. The rela­
tion between technique and the absence of slavery is in no sense 
absolute; as Bertrand Cille has rightly pointed out, human trans­
port by means of slaves was not known in Roman antiquity; yet 
the harnessing of animals had not been developed.
We have here one of those facile, impressive, and altogether 
antihistorical explanations which theorists are so fond of. The 
slave, in fact, represented capital which it was not in the owner’s 
interest to lose or to use haphazardly. And, as the elder Cato indi­
cates, had it been possible to make the slave’s labor more efficient 
and less fatiguing, his master had every interest in doing so. More­
over, it did not cost anything to make use of the free men who lived 
on the vast domains of the public treasury or the limes or the 
Marches,* and later, on the ecclesiastical and seignorial lands. 
Certainly, it was not respect for human life which prompted the 
Romans to spare these people. And the people themselves scarcely 
possessed the freedom of mind or the material possibilities to im­
prove their techniques. Cille has shown admirably that in Athens 
the Greek slaves may have had greater value than the free work­
men.
The second argument is no more applicable. It is true that Chris­
tianity secularized nature. But did this benefit technique? We 
have noted, in passing, the religious origin of many forms of tech­
nique; indeed, nature, as the theater of spiritual forces, gives rise 
to one particular teclinique already mentioned: magic. One of the
•The U m es designated the Empire's boundary regions to the north; the Marches, 
the Scottish and Welsh border areas. (Trans.)
The Technological Society ( 3 7
goals of magic is to render the gods propitious to practical action 
and to put the '‘powers’*  at the service of material technique. The 
representation of nature as inhabited by the gods was itself a 
potent act, and favorable, if not to all applications, certainly to 
technique itself. Taboos applied only to certain concrete applica­
tions which were determined by ideas of right and wrong. Man 
thus felt that his actions were justified by the help given him by 
the gods of nature. Christianity, however, deprived him of this 
justification.
What was the doctrinal position of early Christianity regarding 
practical activity, from the very beginning? On the moral plane, 
Christianity condemned luxury and money— in short, everything 
that represented the earthly city, which was consecrated to Satan 
and opposed to the City of God. This was the era of the anchorite, 
of the renunciation of city life, of cenobitism presented as an ideal. 
The tendency was toward the restriction of economic life. On the 
theological plane, there was the conviction that the world was ap­
proaching its end, that it was useless to strive to develop or cultivate 
it, for the Lord was soon to return. It was wiser to be concerned 
with eschatology than with worldly affairs.
At the beginning of the medieval period, these doctrines lost 
some of their hold (although they persisted under other guises—  
the feeling about death, for instance). But another element of 
Christianity remained which was opposed to technical develop­
ment: the moral judgment which Christians passed an all human 
activities.
Technical activity did not escape Christian moral judgment The 
question “Is it righteous?” was asked of every attempt to change 
modes of production or of organization. That something might be 
useful or profitable to men did not make it right and just. It had to 
fit a precise conception of justice before Cod. When an element 
of technique appeared to be righteous from every point of view, 
it was adopted, but even then with excessive caution. Only inven­
tions (representing a choice among techniques made by individ­
uals versed in Greek or Latin) judged worthy were applied or 
even allowed to become known. It was within this narrow compass 
that certain monks propagated and improved technical instru­
ments. The spread of the hydraulic mill by the Cistercians is well 
known; likewise the many specialized mills to be found at the
TECHNIQUES38 )
Abbey of Royaumont (the smith’s mill, the fuller's mill, etc.). But 
these exceptions were few.
The search for justice before God, the measuring of technique 
by other criteria than those of technique itself— these were the 
great obstacles that Christianity opposed to technical progress. 
They operated in the Middle Ages in all areas of life, and made 
history coincide with theology.
The age of the Reformation, in its effort to return to the most 
primitive conception of Christianity, broke down many barriers. 
But, even then, it was not so much from the influence of the new 
theology as from the shock of the Renaissance, from humanism 
and the authoritarian state, that technique received a decisive im­
petus.
The Sixteenth Century. In the period from the sixteenth to the 
eighteenth century the absence of technique in all areas but the 
mechanical is striking. There was an absence of human reasoning 
concerning action, of efforts directed toward simplification and 
systematization, and of concern for efficiency. Certain important 
technical achievements were made— for example, guns and gun 
factories— and there was some agricultural research. But it is sig­
nificant that histories of technique (Pierre Ducasse’s, for ex­
ample) leap from the Middle Ages to the end of the eighteenth 
century. Indeed, the period which followed the Renaissance and 
the Reformation was much less fertile in invention than the period 
whichhad preceded them.
Printing, the nautical compass, gunpowder (also copied from 
the East), all date from the fifteenth century. It would not do to 
minimize the importance of these inventions. For Norbert Wiener, 
they “constitute the locus of an industrial revolution which pre­
ceded the principal industrial revolution.” Wiener, in a remarkable 
way, relates the principal inventions of this period to navigation, 
which, he proposes, was the propulsive force behind research. 
Alongside these major inventions, this period also saw a multitude 
of discoveries and new applications in banking, armaments, ma­
chinery, architecture (for example, the discovery of a new system 
for constructing the dome, as applied to Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs), 
and in agriculture and the making of furniture.
The fifteenth century, in addition, is notable for a number of 
technical manuals from southern Germany and northern Italy
The Technological Society ( 3 9
( written at the beginning of the century and printed and circulated 
at the end of it). These show a general interest in these problems, a 
technical preoccupation on the part of the men of the times. The 
great voyages were probably a consequence rather than a cause of 
this technical progress.
But this technical drive slackened during the sixteenth century, 
which became poorer and poorer in technique, and technical weak­
ness persisted through the seventeenth century and into the be­
ginning of the eighteenth. This poverty of technical achievement, 
which lasted two centuries, leads us once more to question the 
influence of the Reformation. What caused this slowdown of tech­
nical progress after the fifteenth century, which had been so rich 
in discoveries of all kinds?
An uninitiated reader who opens a scientific treatise on law, econ­
omy, medicine, or history published between the sixteenth and the 
eighteenth centuries is struck most forcibly by the complete ab­
sence of logical order. The materials are treated successively with­
out any connection, progression of thought, development, or show 
of proof. The reader is apparently to be guided only by the au­
thor’s fancy. Every chapter in a scientific work, say, of the sixteenth 
century, is a self-contained unit which justifies and proves itself. 
A mere affirmation by the author generally serves as proof. And he 
lets himself go in a free association of ideas which are in no way 
pertinent to the subject; his thoughts often wend off to matters 
completely unconnected with the subject of the book.
Purely personal reflection and private experience form the foun­
dations of these books; in no sense do they represent an effort at 
common inquiry, reciprocal control, or search for the best method, 
all of which are indispensable for technique. The plan of a book 
was not laid out with the reader in mind; it was not based on 
subject matter, but rather on the personal fancy of the author, or 
on more obscure reasonings. Even men of powerful intellect such 
as Jean Bodin did not escape these failings.
A second characteristic of this scientific literature is that it at­
tempts to set down in one book the whole realm of knowledge. It 
is not rare to find, in works on law in the sixteenth or seventeenth 
centuries, extended treatments of archaeology, theology, psy­
chology, and linguistics, not to mention history and literature. En­
tire chapters concerned with magical practices or Peruvian soci-
TECHNIQUES40)
ology may interrupt the course of a book devoted to revenues or to 
the jurisprudence of the Parliament of Bordeaux.
This amalgam of reflections and miscellaneous bits of knowledge 
is found in the works of the best authors; it demonstrates the ab­
sence of intellectual specialization. The intellectual ideal was uni­
versality, and it was a rare thing for a judge, say, to be ignorant 
of alchemy, or a historian, of medicine. This was, in effect, an 
extension by humanism of the universalism to which medieval 
theology aspired.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries every intellectual had 
perforce to be a universalist. He had to have complete knowledge, 
and when he wrote on a given subject he felt constrained to put 
into the work everything he knew, pertinent or not. This was by 
no means a sign of muddleheadedness but rather of the prevailing 
search for a synthesized, universal system of knowledge. Every 
author sought to put his whole self into his work, even in the case 
of a technical book. Not the subject but the author dominated the 
work: this tendency itself is contrary to technical inquiry. The 
search was not for practical knowledge but for a comprehensive 
explication of phenomena. Thus Descartes, after having established 
an impeccable method of reasoning, gives himself over to the out­
pourings of his imagination in order to explain— to take a single 
example— the movements of the tides.
This explains another characteristic of the hooks written after 
the century of humanism: their lack of convenience. We find few 
tables of contents, no references, no division into sections, no 
indices, no chronology, sometimes not even pagination. The ap­
paratus standard for scientific works today is not found even rudi- 
mentarily in the most perfect works of the period; and its absence 
is characteristic of the absence of intellectual technique. The books 
of the time were not written to be used, along with hundreds of 
others, to locate a piece of information accurately and quickly, or 
to validate or invalidate an experiment, or to furnish a formula. 
They were not written to be consulted. They were written to be 
read patiently in their entirety and to be meditated upon. Again, 
this goes back to the ideal of universality.
The presentation of a book as an author’s entire self, as a per­
sonal expression of his very being, supposes that the reader sought 
in it not the solution of a given difficulty or the answer to a given
The Technological Society (41
problem, but rather to make personal contact with the author. It 
was more a question of a personal exchange than of taking an ob­
jective position. ‘
This applies to every other field of endeavor until the eighteenth 
century. Thus, in the simpjest technical form, the mechanical, no 
decisive progress was made during this time ( unless Pascal were to 
be considered the sole exception; but even Pascal merely extended 
already known techniques). The same holds true for financial, ad­
ministrative, and military techniques, in spite of what Vauban says 
to the contrary.
Then an intermediate situation developed. But despite the efforts 
at co-ordination and systematization made by such great techni­
cians as Richelieu and Colbert, the only result was a greater com­
plication of tire system, without much gain in efficiency. On the ad­
ministrative and political level, all the new organs (each valuable 
in itself and without doubt efficient, but representing only an addi­
tion to what already existed) had to take into consideration every 
other organ already functioning in the same field. New complicated 
departments, jurisdictions, and hierarchies unceasingly weighed 
down the machinery. On the financial plane, the same monstrous 
growth occurred— for valid reasons— but it resulted in enfeeble- 
ment beneath a seeming efficiency. There was no change in finan­
cial technique, in spite of all the efforts of Colbert, who saw what 
should be done. There was no change in the technique of recruit­
ment, supply, and administration of the army, in spite of the efforts 
of Louvois, who saw just as clearly what had to be done. Louis XIV 
was an impotent monarch, despite his authority, because of the 
absence of technical means.
Society was at a crossroads. More and more the need was felt to 
create new means; even the structure these must take was clearly 
perceived. But the framework of society, the ideas in currency, the 
intellectual positions of the day were not favorable to their realiza­
tion. It was necessary to employ technical means in a framework 
foreign to them; these techniques were powerless to force a deci­
sion or to eliminate outmoded means. They ran up against the 
profound humanism, issue of Renaissance humanism, which still 
haunted the seventeenth century— it believed not only in knowl­
edge and respect for the human being but in the genuine su­
premacy of man over means. This humanism, bound up with the
42) TECHNIQUES
idea of universalism, did not allow techniques to grow. Men re­
fused to conform to any uniform law, even when it operated for 
their own good. This refusal was found in all strata of society: in 
the most complex way when finance directors and parliamentary 
counselors refused to utilize new and precise techniques of ac­
counting and legislative supremacy; in the most summary way 
when the peasants rejected new and rational methods of recruit­
ment proposed for the army.
The world had to wait for the eighteenth century to see techni­
cal progress suddenly explode in every country and in every area 
of human endeavor.
The Industrial Revolution. The term industrial revolution is ap­
plied exclusively to the development of machinery, but that is to 
see only one side of it. In actual fact, the industrial revolution was 
merely one aspect of the technical revolution. It is preposterous 
that a specialist such as Lewis Mumford can write that he has found 
in the various modes of exploiting energy the key to the evolution 
of technique and the moving force behind its transformations. In 
his view, a first period, which lasted until about 1750, knew only 
hydraulic energy; a second period, from 1750 to 1880, is the age 
of coal; and a third, that of electricity. (The use of nuclear energy 
has only recently appeared; it is perhaps to be reckoned as part 
of the age of electricity.)
Mumford’s thesis is incomprehensible unless technique is re­
stricted to the machine; Mumford actually makes this identifica­
tion. His distinction is then valid as a plan for the historical study 
of machines, but it is totally invalid for the study of technical 
civilization. When technical civilization is considered as a whole, 
this classification and explanation are shockingly surr.rr.a ry and 
superficial. Norbert Wiener likewise rejects tbe classification 
founded on the different sources of energy. For him there has been 
only one industrial revolution, and that consisted in the replace­
ment of human muscle as a source of energy. And, he adds, there 
is a second revolution in the making whose object is the replace­
ment of the human brain. Of this last we have as yet only prepara­
tions and indications. W e are not yet there. What we are witnessing 
at the moment is a rearrangement of the world in an intermediate 
stage; the change is not in the use of a natural force but in the 
application of technique to all spheres of life.
The Technological Society (43
The technical revolution meant the emergence of a state that was 
truly conscious of itself and was autonomous in relation to anything 
that did not serve its interests— a product of the French Revolu­
tion, It entailed the creation of a precise military technique ( Fred­
erick the Great and Napoleon) in the field of strategy and in the 
fields of organization, logistics, and recruitment; the beginning of 
economic technique with the physiocrats, and later the liberals. In 
administration and police power, it was the period of rationalized 
systems, unified hierarchies, card indices, and regular reports. 
W ith Napoleon particularly, there was a tendency toward mecha­
nization which resulted from the application of technique to more 
or less human spheres of action.
The revolution also entailed the exertion and the regrouping of 
all the national energies. There were to be no more loafers (under 
the French Revolution, they were imprisoned), no more privileged 
persons, no special interests. Everyone must serve in accordance 
with the strictures of technique.
From the judicial point of view, the technical revolution entailed 
the great systematization of law in the Napoleonic codes and the 
definitive suppression of spontaneous sources of law; for example, 
custom. It involved the unification of legal institutions under the 
iron rule of the state and the submission of law to policy. And 
throughout Europe, except in Great Britain, the nations, amazed 
by such an efficient operation, abandoned their traditional judicial 
systems in favor of the state.
This systematization, unification, and clarification was applied 
to everything— it resulted not only in the establishment of budget­
ary rules and in fiscal organization, but in the systematization of 
weights and measures and the planning of roads. All this repre­
sented technique at work. From this point of view, it might be said 
that technique is the translation into action of man s concern to 
master things by means of reason, to account for what is subcon­
scious, make quantitative what is qualitative, make clear and pre­
cise the outlines of nature, take hold of chaos and put order into it.
In intellectual activity the same effort was evident, particularly in 
the creation of an intellectual technique for history and biology. 
The principles established by Descartes were applied and resulted 
not only in a philosophy but in an intellectual technique.
These phenomena are so far from being sources of energy that it
44) TECHNIQUES
can scarcely be maintained that mechanical transformation 
brought about all the rest. In fact, the widespread mechanical de­
velopment, spurred by the exploitation of energy, came after most 
of these other techniques. It would almost seem that the order was 
reversed, that the appearance of these other techniques was nec­
essary to the evolution of the machine— which certainly had no 
greater influence on society than, say, the organization of the 
police.
The revolution resulted not from the exploitation of coal but 
rather from a change of attitude on the part of the whole civiliza­
tion. Here we are faced with a most difficult question: Why, after 
such slow progress for centuries, did such an eruption of technical 
progress take place in a century and a half? Why, at a certain 
moment in history, did something become possible which had not 
seemed possible before? We must confess that the ultimate reason 
escapes us. Why did inventions suddenly burst forth in the second 
half of the eighteenth century? We cannot say. Here we are at the 
center of the mystery of invention, which strangely came to life for 
this brief moment.
The inventions of the nineteenth century are much more easily 
explained. A kind of chain reaction was set up: the discoveries 
made at the beginning of the century generated those that followed. 
There was a logical and foreseeable succession of events, once the 
first steps had been taken.
But why were the first steps taken? We will never know, and, in 
any case, that is not the purpose of this investigation. We ask 
rather why technical inventions have proliferated so radically and 
developed to the point where they threaten to engulf society. Why 
did the limitless applicability of the sciences become a reality 
when hitherto it had been restrained and equivocal? The Greeks 
knew that machines could be utilized; why did it devolve upon the 
nineteenth century to utilize them? The question, indeed, is why 
the nineteenth century not only made applications but did so on 
such a grand scale. Leonardo da Vinci' invented a prodigious num­
ber of useful devices (the alarm clock, the silk-winder, a machine 
for carding textile fabrics, and so on), and proposed many technical 
improvements (double-hulled ships, the universal joint, conical 
gears, etc.). Why did none of his inventions and improvements 
find practical application?
The Technological Society ( 4 5
There are a number of general answers. One can relate everything 
to scientific progress, for example. The eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries saw advances in application, not in pure knowledge or in 
speculation. It is useless to recount the scientific evolution of this 
period or to enumerate the sensational series of principles and laws 
formulated and applied at this time. Parenthetically, it might be 
noted that the scientific revolution began as early as the first half 
of the seventeenth century. Experiments were then performed to 
prove the exactness of quantitative hypotheses. Moreover, a psy­
chological transformation occurred which led to the consideration 
of phenomena as worthy of study in themselves. This prepared the 
way for technical progress, but it cannot explain it. These scientific 
discoveries represent necessary conditions— but not imperatives. 
It is evident that applications are impossible without principles, but, 
once principles have been established, applications do not neces­
sarily follow. Applications may be made out of simple curiosity, as 
among the Creeks or among the makers of automatons in the 
eighteenth century. (These automatons were not without experi­
mental value. Research in cybernetics today likewise ends in the 
making of automatons.)
The close link between scientific research and technical inven­
tion appears to be a new factor in the nineteenth century. Accord­
ing to Mumford, “the principal initiatives came, not from the 
inventor-engineer, but from the scientist who established the gen­
eral law." The scientist took cognizance both of the new raw ma­
terials which were available and of the new human needs which 
had to be met Then he deliberately oriented his research toward a 
scientific discovery that could be applied technically. And he did 
this either out of simple curiosity or because of definite commercial 
and industrial demands. Pasteur, for instance, was encouraged in 
his bacteriological research by wine producers and silkworm grow­
ers.
In the twentieth century, this relationship between scientific re­
search and technical invention resulted in the enslavement of 
science to technique. In the nineteenth century, however, science 
was still the determining cause of technical progress. The society of 
the eighteenth century was not yet mature enough to allow the sys­
tematic development of inventions. As Siegfried Giedion says, the 
France of that period was a testing ground. Ideas proliferated but
46) TECHNIQUES
could take no final form until society had undergone a transforma­
tion.
What distinguishes the eighteenth century is that applications 
were made for reasons of utility; soon the only justification of science 
was applicability. Most historians of technique content themselves 
with invoking philosophy to explain this.
The philosophy of the eighteenth century did indeed favor tech­
nical applications. It was naturalistic and sought not only to know 
but also to exploit nature. It was utilitarian and pragmatic. It con­
cerned itself with easing human life, with bringing more pleasure 
into it and simplifying its labor. For the eighteenth century, man’s 
life was narrowly confined to the material; it seemed evident that 
the problem of life would be resolved when men were able to work 
less while consuming more. The goal of science thus appeared to 
be fixed by philosophy.
This philosophy was concrete; it was bound up with material re­
sults. What cannot be seen cannot be judged, and this explains this 
century’s judgment of history: that tbe foundation of civilizations 
is technique, not philosophy or religion.
For these admirable philosophers, technique had the enormous 
superiority of manifesting itself in a concrete way and of leaving its 
tracks for all to read. Voltaire and Diderot were its principal ex­
ponents. But I am unable to give this philosophy the highest place 
in the history of the development of techniques. It played a role, 
but it was not the prime force behind the technical movement. 
To say it was would be to exaggerate the force of these philosophic 
ideas and systems, which affected only a small minority of French­
men and a minute elite abroad. The technical movement was a 
Eurovean movement; the ideas of these philosophic minorities 
could scarcely have penetrated Europe in such a way as to make 
evident to everyone the excellence of technical progress. We have 
only to recall popular reactions to machinery— for example, to 
Vaucanson’s loom, to the first steamboat, and to the first blast fur­
naces. These philosophic ideas scarcely suffice to explain the re­
markable mobilization of all human forces in the nineteenth cen­
tury.
It is even questionable whether this philosophy was universally 
accepted. At other times there have been utilitarian currents in 
philosophy, but they represented only one branch of philosophy
The Technological Society (4 7
among several and did not lead to such a radical transformation of 
society.
The optimistic atmosphere of the eighteenth century, more than 
this philosophy, created a climate favorable to the rise of technical 
applications. The fear of evil diminished. There was an improve­
ment in manners; a softening of the conditions of war; an increasing 
sense of man’s responsibility for his fellows; a certain delight in 
life, which was greatly increased by the improvement of living 
conditions in nearly all classes except the artisan; the building of 
fine houses in great numbers. All these helped persuade Europeans 
that progress could only be achieved by the exploitation of natural 
resources and the application of scientific discoveries.
This state of mind created, in the second half of the eighteenth 
century, a land of good conscience on the part of scientists who de­
voted their research to practical objectives. They believed that hap­
piness and justice would result from their investigations; and it is 
here that the myth of progress had its beginning.
It is clear that this atmosphere was favorable to technical de­
velopment. But, in itself, it was not enough. How, then, are we to 
explain the sudden blossoming of technique in the nineteenth cen­
tury? (The eighteenth century was only the preliminary phase of 
technical application; the nineteenth century is the really interest­
ing period.) I feel that this transformation of civilization can be 
explained by the conjunction in time of five phenomena: the frui­
tion of a long technical experience; population expansion; the suit­
ability of the economic environment; the plasticity of the social 
milieu; and the appearance of a clear technical intention.
The first of these factors must not be neglected: every modem 
technical application had ancestors. Arthur Vierendeel and Lewis 
Mumford have analyzed these preparations. Every invention has 
its roots in a preceding technical period, and every period bears in 
itself “not only the trivial residue but also the valuable survivals of 
past technologies, and the nuclei of new ones.” What appears to be 
genuinely new is the formation of a “technical complex,” which, ac­
cording to Mumford, consists of a series of partial inventions that 
combine into an ensemble. This unit begins to function when the 
greatest number of its constituents have been assembled, and its 
trend is toward continuous self-perfection. From 1000 -to about 
1750, there had been a slow fermentation which had no immediate
TECHNIQUES4 « )
consequences but which had amassed materials in every area of 
life. They had only to be drawn on for the technical miracle to take 
place. This continuity has been analyzed by Vierendeel in particu­
lar; and Wiener emphasizes it when he writes; “It is interesting to 
reflect on the fact that every tool possesses a genealogy and is the 
result of the took which served to make it.” This enormous sum of 
experiments, of apparatus, of inquiries was put to use abruptly at 
the end of an evolutionary period which had lasted for nearly ten 
centuries without social catastrophe. Continuity of this kind was 
important because it made unnecessary the transmission of the 
technical legacy from one civilization to another, an operation 
which inevitably involves the loss of a part of it, especially a part 
of the social forces that apply to nontechnical areas. This continuity 
is found in all fields of technique, from finance to transport If 
technical progress does not appear at a given moment, it is only 
because the social milieu is not completely favorable. But it is 
ripening underground; it k  self-perpetuating even while it k  dor­
mant, as in the seventeenth century. This long preparation was 
necessary as support and foundation for the structure the nine­
teenth century was to build; it represented what Charles Moraz6 
in his Essai sur la civilisation dOccident calk “collective incuba­
tion,” This incubation, consisting of millions of accumulated ex­
periments, was the preparation for the moment of formulation, of 
expression.
A second factor was equally necessary: the population expansion. 
Here again we find ourselves face to face with a familiar problem. 
For two decades population studies in relation to the development 
of civilization have demonstrated that there is a close link between 
technique and population: the growth of population entails a 
growth of needs which cannot be satisfied except by technical de­
velopment. From another viewpoint, a population expansion offers 
favorable grounds for research and technical growth by furnishing 
not only the necessary market but also the requisite human ma­
terial.
The third condition has been analyzed by Vincent. If technical 
progress is to take place, the economic milieu must combine two 
apparently contradictory traits: it must be at once stable and in 
flux. The foundations of economic life must be stable so that 
primary technical research can be devoted to well-defined objects
The Technological Society (49
and situations. But at the same time this milieu must be capable of 
great change, so that technical inventions can be absorbed into the 
economy, and research stimulated. A rigid economy brings with it 
fixed customs which stifle the inventive faculty. Studies of the eco­
nomic situation in the second half of the eighteenth century show 
that it had precisely these two opposed characteristics. But this is 
well known. I shall do no more than point it out and shall devote 
greater space to the last two conditions, which are usually neg­
lected.
The fourth condition is possibly the most decisive. It is the 
plasticity of the social milieu, which involves two factors: the dis­
appearance of social taboos and the disappearance of natural social 
groups.
The first of these appears in various forms, depending on the 
society involved. In the Western civilization of the eighteenth cen­
tury there are two large categories: the taboos resulting from 
Christianity, and sociological taboos. The first category takes in all 
religious and moral ideas, judgments concerning action, the prevail­
ing conception of man, and the ends proposed for human life. 
These were, theoretically and factually, opposed to technical de­
velopment. When faith had been translated into prejudice and 
ideology, and personal religious experience incorporated into a so­
cial institution, a hardening of moral positions took place which 
corresponded to the creation of genuine taboos. The natural order 
must not be tampered with and anything new must be submitted 
to a moral judgment— which meant an unfavorable prejudgment. 
This was the popular mentality created by Christianity, particu­
larly during the seventeenth century. Closely related to these were 
sociological taboos, in particular the conviction that a natural 
hierarchy exists which nothing can modify. The position of the 
nobility and the clergy, and above all of the king, could not be 
questioned. When in the middle of the eighteenth century these be­
gan to be questioned, the reaction of the people was that sacrilege 
was being committed; the stupor that accompanied the execution 
of Louis XVI was a religious stupor. In fact, regicide was seen as 
deicide. This constitution of society, which everyone relied on and 
recognized as the only one possible, was an obstacle to technique 
within it; technique was held to be fundamentally sacrilegious. 
The natural hierarchy operated against the practice of the mechani-
TECHNIQUESS o )
cal arts, which would only bring conveniences to the lower 
classes. And since the lower classes too believed in the natural 
hierarchy, they could only be submissive and passive; they did not 
try to better their lot. The important point here was not the reality 
of the facts or the existence of the hierarchy; it was belief in its 
natural and sacred character which stood in the way of technique.
The very structure of society— based on natural groups— was 
also an obstacle. Families were closely organized. The guilds and 
the groups formed by collective interests (for example, the Uni­
versity, the Parliament, the Confraternities and Hospitals) were 
distinct and independent. The individual found livelihood, patron­
age, security, and intellectual and moral satisfactions in collectives 
that were strong enough to answer all his needs but limited enough 
not to make him feel submerged or lost. They sufficed to satisfy 
the average man who does not try to gratify imaginary needs if 
his position is fairly stable, who opposes innovation if he lives in a 
balanced milieu, even though he is poor. This fact, which is so 
salient in the three millennia of history we know, is misunderstood 
by modern man, who does not know what a balanced social en­
vironment is and the good he could derive from it.
Man himself may feel less need to improve his condition. In ad­
dition, the very existence of natural groups is an obstacle to the 
propagation of technical invention. For primitive peoples, inven­
tion spreads in certain geographical areas within certain groups 
according to existing social bonds. Exterior diffusion, however, the 
crossing of a sociological frontier, is extremely difficult. This phe­
nomenon exists in every society. Division into closely constituted 
groups is an obstacle to the propagation of inventions. The same 
holds for guilds. Guilds act not only spontaneously and as socio­
logical units, but also voluntarily and according to the lawful con­
stitution of each. This is also true of religious groups. Consider, for 
example, the manufacturing secrets jealously guarded by the 
French Protestants in the seventeenth century. The diffusion of 
every technique tends to be checked by these social divisions.
These obstacles disappeared at the time of the French Revolu­
tion, in 1789. With the disappearance of religious and social taboos 
came the creation of new religions, the affirmation of philosophic 
materialism, the suppression of the various hierarchies, regicide, 
and the struggle against the clergy. These factors acted powerfully
The Technological Society ( 5 1
upon the popular consciousness and contributed to the collapse of 
the belief in these taboos.
At the same time (and this is the second factor which made for 
the plasticity of the social milieu) a systematic campaign was 
waged against all natural groups, under the guise of a defense of 
the rights of the individual; for example, the guilds, the com­
munes, and federalism were attacked, this last by the Girondists. 
There were movements against the religious orders and against the 
privileges of Parliament, the Universities, and the Hospitalers. 
There was to be no liberty of groups, only that of the individual. 
There was likewise a struggle to undermine the family. Revolu­
tionary legislation promoted its disintegration; it had already been 
shaken by the philosophy and the fervors of the eighteenth century. 
Revolutionary laws governing divorce, inheritance, and paternal 
authority were disastrous for the family unit, to the benefit of the 
individual. And these effects were permanent, in spite of temporary 
setbacks. Society was already atomized and would be atomized 
more and more. The individual remained the sole sociological unit, 
but, far from assuring him freedom, this fact provoked the worst 
kind of slavery.
The atomization we have been discussing conferred on society 
the greatest possible plasticity— a decisive condition for technique. 
The breakup of social groups engendered the enormous displace­
ment of people at the beginning of the nineteenth century and 
resulted in the concentration of population demanded by modem 
technique. To uproot men from their surroundings, from the rural 
districts and from family and friends, in order to crowd them into 
cities still too small for them; to squeeze thousands into unfit lodg­
ings and unhealthy places of work; to create a whole new environ­
ment within the framework of a new human condition (it is too 
often overlooked that the proletariat is the creation of the indus­
trial machine)— all this was possible only when the individual was 
completely isolated. It was conceivable only when he literally had 
no environment, no family, and was not part of a group able to 
resist economic pressure; when he had almost no way of life left.
Such is the influence of social plasticity. Without it, no technical 
evolution is possible. For the individual in an atomized society, only 
the state was left: the state was the highest authority and it became 
omnipotent as well. The society produced was perfectly malleable
5 * )  TECHNIQUES
and remarkably flexible from both the intellectual and the material 
points of view. The technical phenomenon had its most favorable 
environment since the beginning of history.
At the same time, by a historical coincidence (whether fortuitous 
or not, I shall not undertake to say), what I have called a clear 
technical intention came into being. In all other civilizations there 
had been a technical movement— more or less extensive work of 
this kind— but not a mass intention, clearly understood and de­
liberately guiding the whole society in a technical direction.
Ciedion says of the period from 1750 to 1850: "Invention was a 
part of the normal course of life. Everyone invented. Every entre­
preneur dreamed of more rapid and economical means of fabrica­
tion. The work was done unconsciously and anonymously. No­
where else and never before was the number of inventions per 
capita as great as in America in the 6o‘s of that century.”
It is possible that a similar phenomenon took place in prehistoric 
times when technique appeared out of sheer necessity. Pressed on 
all sides, man reacted by creating technique. In historical times the 
situation changed, however. Homo sapiens had by then established 
his supremacy over the other mammals with respect to natural 
forces. Some technical efforts had been pursued, now in one field, 
now in another; for example, in the military art of the Assyrians or 
in the art of construction of the Egyptians. There were always in­
dividuals who possessed a clear vision of technical supremacy; say, 
Archimedes in mechanics, or Loyola in spiritual technique. But wc 
almost never find the distinctive characteristic of our time— a precise 
view of technical possibilities, the will to attain certain ends, ap­
plication in all areas, and adherence of the whole of society to a 
conspicuous technical objective. All these, taken together, con­
stitute what I have termed a clear technical intention.
Whence arose this intention? Many causes conspired to produce 
it, among them the influence of the philosophy of the eighteenth 
century, reinforced by the philosophy of Hegel and later that of 
Marx. But there were other factors which were as important. What 
really produced the general movement in favor of technique was 
special interest.
This technical movement has been studied by men as different 
as Descartes and Mare. But it was only when industrial self-inter-
The Technological Society (5 3
est, for the sake of efficiency, demanded a search for the “one best 
way to do work” that research was begun by Gilbreth in the field of 
technique, with the amazing results we see today.
Special interest was and is the great motive force behind the de­
velopment of technical consciousness— but not necessarily any par­
ticular interest; say, the capitalistic interest or the moneyed inter­
est. The state interest was the first to become conscious in France, 
at the time of the Revolution. The state developed political and in­
dustrial technique, and later, with Napoleon, military and judicial 
technique, because it found them to be potent forces against its 
enemies within and without The state protected “the arts and the 
sciences” (in reality, techniques) not out of greatness of spirit or 
concern for civilization, but out of the instinct for power. After the 
state, it was the bourgeoisie who discovered how much profit could 
be extracted from a consciously developed technique. In fact, the 
bourgeoisie has always been more or less involved with technique. 
They were the initiators of the first financial techniques and, later 
on, of the modern state. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
they saw the possibilities of drawing huge profits from this system, 
especially as they were favored by the crumbling “of morals and 
religion” and felt themselves free, in spite of the idealistic smoke 
screen they raised, to exploit individuals. This class put the interests 
of technique before the interests of individuals, who had to be 
sacrificed in order that technique might progress. It is solely be­
cause the bourgeoisie made money, thanks to technique, that tech­
nique became one of their objectives.
This alliance is well known and we need recall but a few facts. 
James Watt, his steam engine perfected, was ruined and at a 
dead end. It was a bourgeois, Matthew Boulton, who grasped the 
industrial and financial possibilities of Watt’s invention and de­
cided to apply it. Two further facts are pertinent: commercial 
capitalism preceded industrial capitalism; industry owed its rise to 
the accumulation of capital originating from commerce. And where 
did industrialization first occur and become most widespread? In 
England, because capitalism was more highly developed there and 
the bourgeoisie more at liberty to act than anywhere else. This is 
well known. The union between the bourgeoisie and technique 
was expressed not only in the development of factories, but much
5 4  ) TECHNIQUES
more subtly in the fact that the majority of technicians came from 
this class. It was the bourgeoisie which promoted the advance of 
science.
Moreover, the bourgeoisie were so well aware of the relation be­
tween economic success and the scientific foundations of that suc­
cess that they kept in their own hands, almost as a monopoly, the 
instruction which was the only means of access to the great schools 
and faculties that trained the technicians of science and the tech­
nicians of society.5
Technical progress is a function of bourgeois money. Yet today 
the Marxists claim that the bourgoisie either have attempted to 
restrain technical progress or make it serve the purposes of war. 
Their claim, however, does not prevent history from contradicting 
their theories. Marx himself would never have made such state- 
ments, what is true today was not true in his time.
However, this self-interest of the bourgeoisie was not enough to 
carry the whole of society along with it— witness the popular re­
actions against technical progress. As late as 1848, one of the de­
mands of the workers was the suppression of machinery. This is 
easily understood. The standard of living had not risen, men still 
suffered from the loss of equilibrium in their lives brought about by 
a too rapid injection of technique, and they had not yet felt the in­
toxication of the results. The peasants and the workers bore all the 
hardships of technical advance without sharing in the triumphs. 
For this reason, there was a reaction against technique, and so­
ciety was split. The power of the state, the money of the bour­
geoisie were for it; the masses were against.
In the middle of the nineteenth century the situation changed. 
Karl Marx rehabilitated technique in the eyes of the workers. He 
preached that technique can be liberating. Those who exploited it 
enslaved the workers, but that was the fault of the masters and not 
of technique itself.
Marx was perhaps not the first to have said this, but he was the 
first to convince the masses of it. The working class would not be 
liberated by a struggle against technique but, on the contrary, by 
technical progress itself, which would automatically bring about 
the collapse of the bourgeoisie and of capitalism. This reconcilia-
* The author includes here not only faculties such as the Ecole Polytechnique, but 
also adm inistrative tribunals such as the Conseil d'fitat (Trans.)
The Technological Society ( 5 5
tion of the masses to techniques was decisive. But it would not 
have been sufficient to result in a clear consciousness of the tech­
nical objective, the new consensus omnium, had it not appeared 
simultaneously with a second historical fact, namely, the diffusion 
of the so-called benefits of techniques among the masses. These 
benefits included, for example, the conveniences of daily life, the 
progressive shortening of the work day, facilities for public trans­
portation and medicine, new possibilities of making one’s fortune 
(in the United States and in the colonies), housing improvements, 
and so forth. A prodigious upheaval took place between 1850 and 
1914 which convinced everyone of the excellence of a technical 
movement that could produce such marvels and alter human life. 
All this, Marx explained, presaged even better things and pointed 
to the road to follow. Fact and theory were for once in agreement. 
How could public opinion resist?
Drawn by self-interest (the ideal of comfort, for instance), the 
masses went over to the side of technique; society was converted. 
A common will developed to exploit the possibilities of technique 
to the maximum, and groups of the most conflicting interests 
(state and individual, bourgeoisie and working class) united to 
hymn its praises. Literally everyone was agreed on its excellence. 
True, after 1914, certain criticisms came from the intellectuals, but 
these were ineffective because they were usually beside the point 
— manifestations of vague idealism or of sentimental humanitar- 
ianism.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, when technique had 
hardly begun to develop, another voice was raised in prophetic 
warning against it. The voice was Kierkegaard s. But his warnings, 
solidly thought out though they were, and in the strongest sense of 
the word prophetic, were not heeded— for very different reasons. 
They were too close to the truth.
This analysis applies chiefly to the countries where the technical 
movement first developed— England and France. In England 
events took a somewhat different course than in France, but they 
had the same scope and profound significance. The historical se­
quence varied, but the orientation in both countries was toward 
technical development. Social plasticity developed in England by 
different paths and at a different time than in France. Sociological 
taboos were broken at an early date. The regicide of Charles I by
TECHNIQUES5 6 )
Cromwell gave the initial and primary impulse to social plasticity; 
as all writers agree, after this date a rigid social hierarchy no longer 
existed in England. The supreme value was productive and efficient 
labor which permitted the industrious to rise high on the social 
ladder (William Pitt is a good example). The king no longer rep­
resented divine authority, nor was he able to resist the nation. No 
longer was there sociological rigidity based on the royal person or 
on the power of money. It would be an error to interpret sociologi­
cally the England of the eighteenth century in accordance with 
the stability which is discernible in the nineteenth, and which was 
achieved after the technical revolution, when society had entered 
new paths. In the eighteenth century, England was essentially 
mobile and unstable in all its structures. Christianity itself was not 
the conservative force it proved to be on the Continent. Two great 
currents divided English society before the advent of Methodism: 
the Church of England and the Puritans. The Puritans, even after 
their political failure, were the predominant influence. In keeping 
with the trend the Reformation set, they exploded all prevailing 
religious taboos and developed a practical and utilitarian mental­
ity that emphasized the use and even the exploitation of the good 
things of this world given by Cod to men. The relationship of this 
trend to the development of capitalism is well known. The Church 
of England had favored tolerance since the end of the eighteenth 
century and had adopted as its leading principle Bishop War- 
burton’s idea of social utility. Here, too, there was a kind of secular­
ization of religion. Religion is no longer the framework of society; 
it can no longer impose its taboos or forms upon it. Rather, it inte­
grates itself into society, adjusts to it, and adopts the notion of social 
utility as criterion and justification. At the same time the disintegra­
tion and atomization of English social groups occurred— brought 
about not so much by the influence of the state (as in France) as 
by the destruction of peasant society which began in the early 
eighteenth century and of which Defoe and Swift were such elo­
quent witnesses.
The peasant commune and the peasant family were slowly 
mined in the eighteenth century. The historian notes the collapse, 
relentless and more rapid than in France, of a whole society which 
had been in equilibrium until then. The struggle between the 
landed and the moneyed interests ended with the victory of the
The Technological Society ( 5 7
moneyed interests. It is not important here to detail the ways a new 
peasant society, based on the moneyed interest, came into being. 
Newly rich entrepreneurs bought up the great estates and took the 
place of the old gentry, but that is not our concern. Our concern is 
the merchants whose influence changed the organic structure of 
the traditional world. The small landowners and the yeomen were 
eliminated or reduced to an agricultural proletariat, or they were 
forced to migrate to the city. The rural corporations were ruined, 
the communes passed almost completely into the hands of the new 
landlords and ceased to constitute coherent sociological units. The 
movement was accelerated by the application of new agricultural 
methods, which were accepted much more rapidly than in France. 
The enclosure of the commons, which in France took place chiefly 
after 1780, began in England in 1730. The new agricultural tech­
niques were plainly so superior that it was not possible to preserve 
the old “open field” system— the commons, the pastures, and the 
forests; thus the final blow was dealt to the old, organic, peasant 
society. The peasant could not survive as such, and with him, the 
whole of society entered into a state of flux. The plasticity we refer 
to came about in England as a result of this evolution in the use of 
land, which furnished the technical movement with the necessary 
manpower: apathetic, vacant, and uprooted. Not only was this 
manpower necessary for the development of industry; the masses 
thus created were indispensable to faith in techniques and the 
spread of techniques.
To summarize: social plasticity came about earlier in England 
than in France, and the technical movement developed along with 
it. Moreover, the state, which was dominant in French society, did 
not have the same influence in Creat Britain.
This applies too to the development of a clear technical con­
sciousness. In Creat Britain this consciousness appeared as a bour­
geois interest. The spirit behind the introduction of new techniques 
in the rural districts was very different from that which character­
ized France a short time later. The technical movement in France 
was launched by the monarchy and took a scientific form: the 
academies and the research institutes propagated the new tech­
niques throughout the country; and the nobles applied them, very 
often disinterestedly. In England, profit was from the very begin­
ning the prime motive. And empiricism was the dominant factor
TECHNIQUES5« )
because technique was more efficient Techniques were developed 
because it paid to develop them; commercial activity found them 
advantageous. This was true in agriculture as well as in industry.
The English technical movement was marked by the fact that all 
the different financial systems (banks, stock exchanges, insurance 
companies) were perfected. The clear consciousness of the value 
of technique expressed itself primarily in terms of money, and was 
located at the center of the systems of distribution. And the accel­
eration of invention in this area influenced all other techniques. 
The British state attained this clear technical consciousness at a 
comparatively last date, and then only when it saw that techniques 
were to its immediate interest.
This phenomenon of technical clarity sometimes came about 
through an association of the interests of the state and the interests 
of private individuals. In steelmaking, for example, the fact that 
Henry Cort was supplier to the Admiralty was decisive, in 1780, for 
the application and development of steel puddling. The state 
found in this procedure an excellent means of improving its naval 
vessels. However, it was competition with the Napoleonic empire 
that started His Majesty’s government down the road of tech­
nique.
Thereafter, both governments understood that only technical 
efficiency in all governmental relations and enterprises could com­
mand the paths of peace as well as the affairs of war. The English 
state henceforth had the same influence on the development of 
techniques as the French revolutionary state had exerted through 
the establishment of a clear technical consciousness. The way had 
already been paved in England by the emergence of the British 
bourgeoisie. Whatever the differences in its development in Eng­
land and France, however, the technical consciousness that ap­
peared was identical in both countries.
In the United States this took place at the beginning of the nine­
teenth century. Until then, the society of this country was inor­
ganic. But at that time the American social milieu was favorable; 
moreover, the Americans profited from the technical conscious­
ness evolved in Europe, and so they arrived immediately at a 
model for technique. Giedion has noted that the Americans began 
by mechanizing complex operations, which produced the assembly 
line, whereas the Europeans tended to mechanize simple opera-
The Technological Society (5  9
tions, such as spinning. This American accomplishment was the 
result of the exceptional flexibility of the American milieu.
These conditions were not found in the other European coun­
tries: Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia. In these nations the 
social structures remained as they were and the social hierarchy 
was not attacked. The taboos of religion were fanatically respected, 
and those of society were not questioned. The Inquisition and the 
Tribunal of the Empire jealously guarded the spiritual and socio­
logical divisions of society. This world was already undermined, 
ruined, and emptied of content, but its rigid forms were univer­
sally accepted as good. There were few changes in the cities and 
none at all in the rural areas. The traditional organism remained 
intact And when enlightened despotism began to create some ex­
citement, this world was so little prepared that it exhausted itself 
in the struggle against the old social structures. Consider, for ex­
ample, the fate of Peter the Great, Joseph II, and the melancholy 
and celebrated Marquis de Pombal.
Great inventions may have been made in Germany and Russia 
during this period. Everyone is familiar with the claims of Hitler, 
and later of Stalin, that all important discoveries were made in 
their respective countries. Allowing for exaggeration, there is per­
haps some truth in these claims. But the discoveries were not 
applied, and only application counts in the rise of technique. 
Application did not take place because the felicitous combination 
of factors we have discussed was lacking. The social milieu of these 
countries, their spiritual tendencies, group psychology, sociological 
structures, and past history were all unfavorable to the rise of tech­
nique. The state in some countries, principally Prussia, was fav­
orable to it; but a clear technical consciousness on the part of the 
state alone was obviously insufficient to open the door to the great 
mobilization of men and things necessary for this multiform prog­
ress.
The joint occurrence of the five factors we have briefly analyzed 
explains the exceptional growth of technique. Never before had 
these factors coincided. They are, to summarize: (1) a very long 
technical maturation or incubation without decisive checks before 
the final flowering; (2) population growth; (3) a suitable eco­
nomic milieu; (4) the almost complete plasticity of a society mal-
TECHNIQUES6o)
leable and open to the propagation of technique; (5) a clear tech­
nical intention, which combines the other factors and directs them 
toward the pursuit of the technical objective. Some of these condi­
tions had existed in other societies; for example, the necessary tech­
nical preparation and the destruction of taboos in the Roman Em­
pire in the third century. But the unique phenomenon was the 
simultaneous existence of all five— all of them necessary to bring 
about individual technical invention, the mainspring of everything 
eke.
What else can history teach us? Only the vanity of believing we 
can impose our theories on history. Any philosophy which asserts 
that human experience repeats itself is ineffectual.
CHAPTER
OO
THE
CHARACTEROLOGY 
OF TECHNIQUE
In discussing technique today it is impossible not to take a position. 
And the position we take is determined by a historical choice, con­
scious or unconscious.
Acknowledging that the technical phenomenon is a constant of 
human history, is there anything new about its present aspect? 
There are two distinct positions on this question. The first main­
tains that there is no more real technical innovation in the modern 
world than there was in the Stone Age. Jean Fourastie asks hu­
morously whether prehistoric man, the first time he saw a bronze 
sword used, did not feel as menaced by it as we feel by the atom 
bomb. It would seem, then, that technical innovations have al­
ways had the same surprising and unwelcome character for men. 
(This is an inexhaustible source of jokes for motion pictures and 
cartoons.) If we become frightened, we are merely obeying ances­
tral instincts. There is no more real reason to be frightened by the
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE62)
atomic bomb than by any invention thousands of years old— which, 
as we see, has not destroyed the human race. The technique of to­
day has the same characteristics as all preceding techniques. This 
normal development, however rapid and surprising, cannot be of 
danger to us.
In opposition to this resolutely optimistic position, there is an­
other which maintains that we are confronted with a genuinely new 
phenomenon. There is nothing in common between the modern 
technical complex and the fragments of it which are laboriously 
sought out in the course of history to demonstrate that there has al­
ways been technique.For those who hold this viewpoint, the techni­
cal phenomenon represents a complete change, not only of degree, 
but of kind. Modern society is confronted with a transition (her­
alded by Marx and particularly by Engels) which involves change 
of quality as a consequence of change of quantity. This postulate, 
which Engels applied to physical phenomena, holds true for so­
ciological phenomena as well Beyond a certain quantity, the phe­
nomenon, even though in a sense it remains the same, does not 
have the same quality, is not of the same nature.
One cannot choose between these two theses in a subjective 
and a priori manner. It is necessary to examine the objective char­
acteristics of technique to determine whether there has really been 
a change. But what characteristics shall we examine? Not the in­
trinsic ones; these do not change. If we consider intrinsic charac­
teristics, the first position is right. The mental operation by means 
of which Archimedes constructed certain engines of war is iden­
tical with that of any modem engineer who improves a motor. And 
the same instinct impels a man to catapult stones and to construct 
a machine gun. Likewise, the same laws of propagation of ieulmi- 
cal invention operate, no matter what the stage of technical evolu­
tion. However, these identities are not at all convincing.
Many men who have studied the problems posed by different 
techniques admit that there is a radical difference between the tra­
ditional situation and the situation we face today. On the basis of 
intrinsic characteristics, these men have established a distinction be­
tween (a) the fundamental techniques which, as Ducasse says, 
"sum up all man’s relations with his environment,” and (b) the 
techniques which are the results of applied science. The first group 
is composed of techniques which, although seldom identical in
The Technological Society (63
method and form, are identical in intrinsic characteristics. They 
constitute the complex of fundamental techniques which sociolo­
gists such as LeRoi-Gourhan usually study and on the basis of 
which they elucidate the laws of technique. Primitive techniques 
have no reality in themselves; they are merely the intermediary be­
tween man and his environment.
The techniques which result from applied science date from the 
eighteenth century and characterize our own civilization. The new 
factor is that the multiplicity of these techniques has caused them 
literally to change their character. Certainly, they derive from old 
principles and appear to be the fruit of normal and logical evolu­
tion. However, they no longer represent the Same phenomenon. In 
fact, technique has taken substance, has become a reality in itself. 
It is no longer merely a means and an intermediary. It is an object 
in itself, an independent reality with which we must reckon.
However, this often admitted difference does not seem to me to 
characterize conclusively the singularity of the technical situation 
today. The characterization can be challenged because it does not 
rest upon deep historical experience. It is not enough simply to de­
clare, by drawing on everyone’s experience of the disparity be­
tween our technique and the limited needs of our bodies, that 
technique is a reality in itself. We may keep this in mind, but we 
must also recognize that it is incomplete and not altogether con­
vincing.
It is not, then, the intrinsic characteristics of techniques which 
reveal whether there have been real changes, but the characteristics 
of the relation between the technical phenomenon and society. Let 
us take a very simple comparison. A  shell explodes and the explo­
sion is normally always the same. Any fifty shells of the same cali­
ber when exploded display approximately the same objective char­
acteristics from a physical or chemical point of view. The sound, 
light, and projection of fragments remain nearly identical. The in­
trinsic characteristics of the fifty explosions are the same. But if 
forty-nine shells go off in some remote place and the fiftieth goes off 
in the midst of a platoon of soldiers, it cannot be maintained that 
the results are identical. A relation has been established which en­
tails a change. To assess this change, it is not the intrinsic character 
of the explosion which must be examined, but rather its relation to 
the environment In the same way, to learn if there has been, for
T H E  C H A M C R M H a C T  O F  TE C H N IQ U E6 4 )
man, a change in modem technqiue in relation to the old, we mutt 
assess, not the internal characteristics of the technique, but the ac­
tual situation of technique in human society.
To go beyond this and to imagine, for example, what might flave 
been the psychological reaction of primitive men when faced with 
technical invention is pure fantasy. The question put by Jean 
Fourastie, strictly speaking, has no meaning. The working of the 
mind varies according to place and time, and we cannot project our­
selves with any assurance into the mind of primitive man. In 
order to remain within the limits of what can be known, 
we must be content to study the relation between technique and 
society, a relation which has the advantage of being meaningful.
Technique in Civilisation
Traditional Techniques and Society. What was the position of 
technique in the different societies which have preceded ours? 
Most of these societies resembled one another in their technical 
aspects. But it is not enough to say that technique was restricted. 
We must determine the precise characteristics of the limitations, 
which are four in number.
First, technique was applied only in certain narrow, limited areas. 
When we attempt to classify techniques throughout history, we find 
principally techniques of production, of war and hunting, of con­
sumption (clothing, houses, etc.), and, as we have said, magic. This 
complex of techniques would seem to modern man to represent a 
rather considerable domain and, indeed, to correspond to the 
whole of life. What more could there be than producing, consum­
ing, fighting, and practicing magic? But we must look at these 
things in perspective.
In so-called primitive societies, the whole of life was indeed en­
closed in a network of magical techniques. It is their multiplicity 
that lends them the qualities of rigidity and mechanization. Magic, 
as we have seen, may even be the origin of techniques; but the pri­
mary characteristic of these societies was not a technical but a reli­
gious preoccupation. In spite of this totalitarianism of magic, it 
is not possible to speak of a technical universe. Moreover, the im­
portance of techniques gradually diminishes as we reach historical
The Technological Society (6 5
societies. la  these societies, the life o f the group was essentially 
nontechnical. And although certain productive techniques still ex­
isted, the magical forms which had given a technique to social rela­
tions, to political acts, and to military and judicial life tended to 
disappear. These areas ceased to respond to techniques and became 
subject instead to social spontaneities. The law, which had tradi­
tionally expressed itself in certain customs, no longer had any char­
acter of technical rigor; even the state was nothing but a force 
which simply manifested itself. These activities depended more on 
private initiative, short-lived manifestations or ephemeral tradi­
tions, than on a persevering technical will and rational improve­
ments.
Even in activities we consider technical, it was not always that 
aspect which was uppermost. In the achievement of a small eco­
nomic goal, for example, the technical effort became secondary to 
the pleasure of gathering together. “Formerly, when a New Eng­
land family convoked a ‘bee’ (that is, a meeting for working in 
common), it was for all concerned one of the most pleasurable 
times of the year. The work was scarcely more than a pretext for 
coming together.” 1 The activity of sustaining social relations and 
human contacts predominated over the technical scheme of things 
and the obligation to work, which were secondary causes.
Society was free of technique. And even on the level of the indi­
vidual, technique occupied a place much more circumscribed than 
we generally believe. Because we judge in modern terms, we be­
lieve that production and consumption coincided with the whole 
o f life.
For primitive man, and for historical man until a comparatively 
late date, work was a punishment, not a virtue. It was better not 
to consume than to have to work hard; the rule was to work only 
as much as absolutely necessary in order to survive. Man worked 
as little as possible and was content with a restricted consumption 
of goods (as, for example, among the Negroes and the Hindus)—  
a prevalent attitude, which limits both techniques of production 
and techniques of consumption. Sometimes slavery was the answer: 
an entire segment of the population did not work at all and de­
pended on the labor of a minority of slaves. In general, the slaves
1 George C Hom ans, quoted by Jerome Scott and R. P. Lyatom .
6 6 ) THE CHARACTEROLOCV OF TECHNIQUE
did constitute a minority. We must not be misled by Imperial 
Rome, Greece under Pericles, or the Antilles in the eighteenth 
century. In most slaveholding nations, slaves were in a minority.
The time given to the use of techniques was short, compared 
with the leisure time devoted to sleep, conversation, games, or, best 
of all, to meditation. As a corollary, technical activities had little 
place in these societies. Technique functioned only at certain pre­
cise and well-defined times; this was the case in all societies before 
our own. Technique was not part of man’s occupation nor a subject 
for preoccupation.
This limitation of technique is attested to by the fact that in 
the past technique was not considered nearly as important as it is 
today. Heretofore, mankind did not bind up its fate with technical 
progress. Man regarded technical progress more as a relative in­
strument than as a god. He did not hope for very much from it. 
Let us take an example from Giedion’s admirable book, in which 
he elucidates the small importance technique had traditionally.
In our day, we are unable to envisage comfort except as part of 
the technical order of things. Comfort for us means bathrooms, easy 
chairs, foam-rubber mattresses, air conditioning, washing ma­
chines, and so forth. The chief concern is to avoid effort and pro­
mote rest and physical euphoria. For us, comfort is closely asso­
ciated with the material life; it manifests itself in the perfection of 
personal goods and machines. According to Giedion, the men of 
the Middle Ages also were concerned with comfort, but for them 
comfort had an entirely different form and content. It represented 
a feeling of moral and aesthetic order. Space was the primary ele­
ment in comfort. Man sought open spaces, large rooms, the possi­
bility of moving about, of seeing beyond his nose, of not con­
stantly colliding with other people. These preoccupations are alto­
gether foreign to us.
Moreover, comfort consisted of a certain arrangement of space. 
In the Middle Ages, a room could be completely "finished," even 
though it might contain no furniture. Everything depended on pro­
portions, material, form. The goal was not convenience, but rather 
a certain atmosphere. Comfort was the mark of the man’s personal­
ity on the place where he lived. This, at least in part, explains the 
extreme diversity of architectural interiors in the houses of the pe­
riod. Nor was this the result of mere whim; it represented an
The Technological Society (6 7
adaptation to character; and when it had been realized, the man of 
the Middle Ages did not care if his rooms were not well heated 
or his chairs hard.
This concept of comfort, closely bound up with the person, 
clearly takes death for granted, as did man himself; man’s aware­
ness of death likewise profoundly influences his search for an ade­
quate milieu. Giedion’s study is convincing. Medieval man did not 
dream for an instant that technique had any influence at all, even 
on objects which today we consider completely material and con­
sequently of a technical order.
This limitation of the sphere of action of technique was in­
creased even more by the limitation of the technical means em­
ployed in these fields. There was no great variety of means for 
attaining a desired result, and there was almost no attempt to per­
fect the means which did exist It seems, on the contrary, that a 
conscious Malthusian tendency prevailed. It was expressed, for 
example, in the regulations of the guilds concerning tools, and in 
Roman law, by the principle of the economy of forms. Man tended 
to exploit to the limit such means as he possessed, and took care 
not to replace them or create other means as long as the old ones 
were effective. From the judicial point of view, the principle of 
the economy of forms led to the creation of the fewest possible legal 
instruments. Laws were few, and so were institutions. Man used 
the utmost ingenuity to obtain a maximum of results from a mini­
mum of means at the price of fictions, transpositions, applications 
a pari and a contrario, and so on. This was also true industrially. 
Society was not oriented toward the creation of a new instrument 
in response to a new need. The emphasis was rather on the applica­
tion of old means, which were constantly extended, refined, and 
perfected.
The deficiency of the tool was to be compensated for by the 
skill of the worker. Professional know-how, the expert eye were 
what counted: man’s talents could make his crude tools yield the 
maximum efficiency. This was a kind of technique, but it had none 
of the characteristics of instrumental technique. Everything varied 
from man to man according to his gifts, whereas technique in the 
modem sense seeks to eliminate such variability. It is understand­
able that technique in itself played a very feeble role. Everything 
was done by men who employed the most rudimentary means. The
65 )  THE CHARACTEROLOCY O F TECHNIQUE
search for the ’’finished,” for perfection in use, for ingenuity of ap­
plication, took the place of a search for new tools which would 
have permitted men to simplify their work, but also would have 
involved giving up the pursuit of real skill.
Here we have two antithetical orders of inquiry. When there is 
an abundance of instruments that answer all needs, it is impossible 
for one man to have a perfect knowledge of each or the skill to use 
each. This knowledge would be useless in any case; the perfection 
of tlie instrument is what is required, and not the perfection of the 
human being. But, until the eighteenth century, all societies were 
primarily oriented toward improvement in the use of tools and 
were little concerned with the tools themselves. No clean-cut divi­
sion can be made between the two orientations. Human skill, hav­
ing attained a certain degree of perfection in practice, necessarily 
entails improvement of the tool itself. The question is one of tran­
scending the stage of total utilization of the tool by improving it  
There is, therefore, no doubt that the two phenomena do inter­
penetrate. But traditionally the accent was on the human being 
who used the tool and not on the tool he used.
The improvement of tools, essentially the result of the prac­
tice of a personal art, came about in a completely pragmatic way. 
For this reason, we can put in the first category all the techniques 
we have classified with regard to intrinsic characteristics. A small 
number of techniques, not very efficient; this was the situation in 
Eastern and Western society from the tenth century b.c. to the 
tenth century a.d.
The world of technique had still a third characteristic prior to 
the eighteenth century; it was local. Social groups were very strong 
and closed to outsiders. There was little communication, materially 
speaking, and even less from the spiritual point of view. Technique 
spread slowly. Certain examples of technical propagation are al­
ways cited; the introduction of the wheel into Egypt by the Hyksos; 
the Crusades; and so on. But such events took millennia and were 
accidental. In the majority of cases, there was little transmission. 
Imitation took place very slowly and mankind passed from one tech­
nical stage to the next with great difficulty. This is true of material 
techniques, and even more so of non-material techniques.
Creek art remained Creek in industrial projects such as pottery­
making, even when imitated by the Romans. Roman law did not
The Technological Society (69
extend beyond the Roman borders, whereas the Napoleonic code 
was adopted by Turkey and Japan. As for magic, that technique re­
mained completely secret
Every technical phenomenon was isolated from similar move­
ments elsewhere. There was no transmission, only fruitless grop- 
ings. Geographically, we can trace the compass of a given tech­
nique, follow the zones of its influence, imitation, and extension; in 
almost every case we find how small was the extent of its radiation.
Why was this so? The explanation is simple: technique was an 
intrinsic part of civilization And civilization consisted of numerous 
and diversified elements— natural elements such as temperament 
and flora, climate and population; and artificial elements such as 
art, technique, the political regime, etc. Among all these factors, 
which mingled with one another, technique was only one. It was 
inexorably linked with them and depended on them, as they de­
pended on it  It was part of a whole, part of the determinate so­
ciety, and it developed as a function of the whole and shared its 
fate.
Just as one society is not interchangeable with another, so tech­
nique remained enclosed in its proper framework; no more would 
it become universal than the society in which it was embedded. 
Geographically there could be no technical transmission because 
technique was not some anonymous piece of merchandise but 
rather bore the stamp of the whole culture. This entails much more 
than the existence of a simple barrier between social groups. 
Technique was unable to spread from one social group to another 
except when the two were in the same stage of evolution and ex­
cept when civilizations were of the same type. In the past, in other 
words, technique was not objective, but subjective in relation to 
its own culture.
It is understandable, therefore, that technique, incorporated in 
its proper framework, did not evolve autonomously. On the con­
trary, it depended on a whole ensemble of factors which had to 
vary with it. It is not accurate to conceive the movement in the 
oversimplified manner of Marxism, as first the evolution of tech­
nique, and subsequently the alignment of the other factors. This 
veiw is accurate for the nineteenth century but it is false for history 
as a whole. Certain important covariations traditionally existed, 
and these factors, covariant with technique, changed according
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE70)
to the type of civilization. There was, for example, the association 
of technique and the state among the Egyptians and the Incas; of 
technique and philosophy in Greece and China. Francastel has 
shown how technique could be “absorbed and directed by the 
arts,” as happened, say, in the fifteenth century, when it was sub­
ordinated to a plastic vision of the world, which imposed on it 
limits and demands. At that time, there existed a whole “civiliza­
tion well provided with technical inventions, but which deliber­
ately undertook to use them only to the degree in which these in­
ventions would allow it to realize an imaginative construction.” 
Thereafter, we find a complicated “art technique” and, as else­
where, we almost never find technique in a pure state.
The consequence was an extreme local diversity of techniques 
for attaining the same result. No comparison or competition existed 
yet between these different systems; the formulation: "The one best 
way in the world" had not yet been made. It was a question of the 
"best way” in a given locality. Because of this, arms and tools took 
very different forms, and social organizations were extremely di­
verse.
It is impossible to speak of slavery as all of a piece. Roman slav­
ery, for example, had nothing to do with Teutonic slavery, or Teu­
tonic slavery with Chaldean. We habitually use one term to cover 
very different realities. This extreme diversity divested technique 
of its most crucial characteristic. There was no single means 
which was judged best and able to eliminate all others by virtue of 
its efficiency. This diversity has made us believe that there was an 
epoch of experimentation, when man was groping to find his way. 
This is a false notion; it springs from our modem prejudice that the 
stage we find ourselves in today represents the highest level of 
humanity. In reality, diversity resulted not from various experimen­
tal attempts on the part of various peoples, but from the fact that 
technique was always embedded in a particular culture.
Alongside this spatial limitation of technique, we find a time 
limitation. Until the eighteenth century, techniques evolved very 
slowly. Technical work was purely pragmatic, inquiry was empiri­
cal, and transmission slow and feeble. Centuries were required 
for: (a) utilization of an invention (for example, the water mill); 
(b) transition from a plaything to a useful object (gunpowder, 
automatons); (c) transition from a magical to an economic opera-
The Technological Society ( 71
tion (breeding of animals); (d) simple perfecting v u  instru­
ment (the horse yoke and the transition from the simple stick plow 
to the train plow). This was even more true for abstract techniques. 
Abstract techniques, I maintain, are almost nontransmissible in 
time from a given civilization to its successor. We must be some­
what skeptical, and in any case prudent, when thr evolution of 
techniques is presented as an evolution of inventions; actually this 
development was never more than potential. There is nothing to 
prove that true technique existed heretofore, that is, in the sense of 
generalized application. It is possible to compile a fine catalogue of 
seventeenth-century inventions, and to deduce from it that a great 
technical movement was in force at that time. Many writeis have 
fallen into this error— among them, Jean Laloup and Jean Nelis. It 
is not because Pascal invented a calculating machine and Papin 
a steam engine that there was a technical evolution; nor was it 
because a “prototype” of a power loom was built; nor because the 
process of the dry distillation of coal was discovered. As Cille has 
very judiciously noted: "The best-described machines in the eight­
eenth century Encyclopedic are possibly better conceived than 
those of the fifteenth century, but scarcely constitute a revolution." 
The initial problem was to construct the machine, to make the in­
vented technique actually work. The second consisted in the diffu­
sion of the machine throughout the society; and this second step 
proceeded very slowly.
This divergence between invention and technique, which is the 
cause of the time lag we have spoken of, is correctly interpreted 
by Gille in these words: "There was a discontinuity of technical 
progress but there was probably a continuity of research.” Gille 
shows clearly that technical progress develops according to a dis­
continuous rhythm: “It is tied up with demographic or economic 
rhythms and with certain internal contradictions." This discontinu­
ity still contributes to evolutionary lag today.
Slowness in the evolution of techniques is evident throughout 
history. Very few variations seem to have occurred in this constant. 
But it cannot be maintained that this slowness was completely uni­
form. Yet, even in periods that appear rather fertile, it is clear that 
evolution was slow. For example, Roman law, which was particu­
larly rich in the classical period, took two centuries to find a perfect 
form. Moreover, the number of applied inventions was sharply re-
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE7*)
stricted. The fifteenth century, in spite of its importance, produced 
no more than four or five important technical applications. The 
natural consequence of this evolutionary slowness was that tech­
nique could be adapted to men. Almost unconsciously, men kept 
abreast of techniques and controlled their use and influence. This 
resulted not from an adaptation of men to techniques ( as in mod­
em times), but rather from the subordination of techniques to men. 
Technique did not pose the problem of adaptation because it was 
firmly enmeshed in the framework of life and culture. It developed 
so slowly that it did not outstrip the slow evolution of man himself. 
The progress of the two was so evenly matched that man was able 
to keep pace with his techniques. From the physical point of view, 
techniques did not intrude into his life; neither his moral evolu­
tion nor his psychic life were influenced by them. Techniques en­
abled man to make individual progress and facilitated certain 
developments, but they did not influence him directly. Social 
equilibrium corresponded to the slowness of general evolution.
This evolutionary slowness was accompanied by a great irra­
tional diversification of designs. The evolution of techniques was 
produced by individual efforts accompanied by a multitude of scat­
tered experiments. Men made incoherent modifications on instru­
ments and institutions which already existed; but these modifica­
tions did not constitute adaptations. We are amazed when we 
inspect, say, a museum of arms or tools, and note the extreme di­
versity of form of a single instrument in the same place and time. 
The great sword used by Swiss soldiers in the sixteenth century had 
at least nine different forms (hooked, racked, double-handed, hex­
agonal blades, blades shaped like a fleur-de-lis, grooved, etc.). This 
diversity was evidently due to various modes of fabrication peculiar 
to the smiths; it cannot be explained as a manifestation of a techni­
cal inquiry. The modifications of a given type were not the out­
come of calculation or of an exclusively technical w ill They re­
sulted from aesthetic considerations. It is important to emphasize 
that technical operations, like the instruments themselves, almost 
always depended on aesthetic preoccupations. It was impossible to 
conceive of a tool that was not beautiful. As for the idea, fre­
quently accepted since the triumph of efficiency, that the beautiful 
is that which is well adapted to use— assuredly no such notion 
guided the aesthetic searchings of the past No such conception of
' The Technological Society (73
beauty (however true) moved the artisan who carved a Toledo 
blade or fabricated a harness. On the contrary, aesthetic considera­
tions are gratuitous and permit the introduction of uselessness into 
an eminently useful and efficient apparatus.
This diversity of forms was manifestly conditioned by vainglory 
and pleasure— the vainglory of the user, the pleasure of the artisan. 
Both caused changes in the classic type. And why not include as 
well that pure fantasy which runs through all the creations of 
Greece and the Middle Ages?
All this led to a modification of the given type. The search for 
greater efficiency likewise played a role, but it was one factor 
among several. The different forms were subject to trial and error, 
and certain forms were progressively stabilized and imitated, either 
because of their plastic perfection or because of their usefulness. 
The final result was the establishment of a new type derived from 
its predecessor.
Ibis diversity of influences, which operated on all technical 
mechanisms, explains in part the slow tempo of progress in these 
areas. To obey a multiplicity of motives and not reason alone seems 
to be an important keynote of man. When, in the nineteenth cen­
tury, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique 
which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt 
that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind 
had been violated. Men sought to reintroduce indispensable factors 
of aesthetics and morals. Out of this effort came the unprecedented 
creation of certain aspects of style in the 1880’s: the tool with ma­
chine-made embellishments. Sewing machines were decorated 
with cast-iron flowers, and the first tractors bore engraved bulls’ 
heads. That it was wasteful to supply such embellishments soon 
became evident; their ugliness doubtless contributed to the realiza­
tion. Moreover, these flourishes represented a wrong road, techni­
cally speaking. The machine can become precise only to the degree 
that its design is elaborated with mathematical rigor in accordance 
with use. And an embellishment could increase air resistance, 
throw a wheel out of balance, alter velocity or precision. There 
was no room in practical activity for gratuitous aesthetic preoccu­
pations. The two had to be separated. A style then developed based 
on the idea that the line best adapted to use is the most beautiful.
Abstract techniques and their relation to morals underwent the
7 4  ) THE characterolocy of technique
same evolution. Earlier, economic or political inquiries were inex­
tricably bound with ethical inquiry, and men attempted to main­
tain this union artificially even after they had recognized the inde­
pendence of economic technique. Modern society is, in fact, con­
ducted on the basis of purely technical considerations. But when 
men found themselves going counter to the human factor, they re­
introduced— and in an absurd way— all manner of moral theories 
related to the rights of man, the League of Nations, liberty, jus­
tice. None of that has any more importance than the ruffled sun­
shade of McCormick’s first reaper. When these moral flourishes 
overly encumber technical progress, they are discarded— more or 
less speedily, with more or less ceremony, but with determination 
nonetheless. This is the state we are in today.
The elimination of these evolutionary factors and of technical 
diversification has brought about a transformation of the basic 
process of this evolution. Technical progress today is no longer 
conditioned by anything other than its own calculus of efficiency. 
The search is no longer personal, experimental, workmanlike; it is 
abstract, mathematical, and industrial. This does not mean that the 
individual no longer participates. On the contrary, progress is made 
only after innumerable individual experiments. But the individual 
participates only to the degree that he is subordinate to the search 
for efficiency, to the degree that he resists all the currents today 
considered secondary, such as aesthetics, ethics, fantasy. Insofar 
as the individual represents this abstract tendency, he is permitted 
to participate in technical creation, which is increasingly independ­
ent of him and increasingly linked to its own mathematical law.
It was long believed that rational systematization would act to 
reduce the number of technical types: in the measure iliac the fac­
tors of diversification were eliminated, the result would be fewer 
and more simple and precise types. Thus, during the latter part of 
the nineteenth century— in the mechanical, medical, and adminis­
trative spheres— exact instruments were available from which fan­
tasy and irrationality had been totally eliminated. The result was 
fewer instruments. As further progress was made, however, a new 
element of diversification came into play: in order that an instru­
ment be perfectly efficient, it had to be perfectly adapted. But the 
most rational instrument possible takes no account of the extreme 
diversity of the operational environment. This represents an essen^
The T echnological Society ( 7  5
tial characteristic of technique. Every procedure implies a single, 
specific result. As Porter Gale Perrin puts it “Just as a word evokes 
an idea which exactly corresponds to no other word,” so a fixed 
technical procedure generates a fixed result. Technical methods are 
not multipurposive, or adaptable, or interchangeable. Perrin has 
demonstrated this in detail with reference to judicial technique, but 
it also holds for everything else. Take the well-known example, 
cited by Pierre de Latil, of a machine, brought to the highest possi­
ble pitch of perfection, the purpose of which was to produce from 
cast iron, at a single stroke, cylinder heads,for aircraft engines. 
The machine was 28 meters long and cost $100,000. But the mo­
ment the required type of cylinder head was changed, the machine 
became good for nothing; it was unadaptable to any new operation. 
A  judicial system may function perfectly adequately in France but 
not in Turkey. For true efficiency, not only must the rational aspect 
of the machine be taken into account, but also its adaptation to 
the environment. A military tank will have a different form de­
pending on whether it is to be used in mountainous terrain or in 
rice paddies. The more an instrument is designed to execute a sin­
gle operation efficiently and with utmost precision, the less can it be 
multipurposive. A new diversification of technical apparatus thus 
appears: today instruments are differentiated as a result of the con­
tinually more specialized usage demanded of them.
The field of aviation gives us one of the best examples of this. 
Aircraft are described by the use to which they are put We have, 
correspondingly, extremely precise and more and more diversified 
types. The list of French military aircraft, consisting at the present 
of five great categories, is as follows: (1) strategic bombers, 
(2) tactical bombers, (3) pursuit planes, (4) reconnaissance 
planes, and (5) transport planes. These five categories are sub­
divided further; there are altogether thirteen different subtypes, 
none of which are interchangeable with one another. Each has very 
different characteristics resulting from more and more refined tech­
nical adaptations.
The same extensive differentiation is found in much less impor­
tant areas. A recent brochure of the world's largest refiner of lubri­
cating oils fists fifteen different kinds of lubricants designed exclu­
sively for automobiles. Each type corresponds to a definite use, each 
possessing specific qualities, and all equally necessary.
7 6) the chabacterolocy or technique
A fourth characteristic of technique, which results from the 
characteristics just enumerated, is the possibility, reserved to the 
human being, of choice. Inasmuch as all techniques were geo­
graphically and historically limited, societies of many different 
types were able to exist. For the most part, there was an equilib­
rium between two major types of civilization— the active and the 
passive. This distinction is well known. Some societies are oriented 
toward the exploitation of the earth, toward war, conquest, and ex­
pansion in all its forms. Other societies are inwardly oriented; they 
labor just enough to support themselves, concentrate on them­
selves, are not concerned with material expansion, and erect solid 
barriers against anything from without. From the spiritual point of 
view, these societies are characterized by a mystical attitude, by a 
desire for self-dissolution and absorption into the divine.
Human societies are variable, however. A group which has 
hitherto been active might become passive. The Tibetans, for in­
stance, were conquerors and believers in magic until their conver­
sion to Buddhism. Thereafter they became the world s most pas­
sive and mystical people. The reverse can also take place.
The two types of society coexisted throughout history; indeed, 
this seemed necessary to the equilibrium of world and man. Until 
the nineteenth century, technique had not yet excluded one of them. 
Moreover, man could isolate himself from the influence of tech­
nique by attaching himself to a given group and exerting influence 
on this group. Of course, other constraints acted on him; the indi­
vidual was never completely free with respect to his group, but 
these constraints were not completely decisive or imperative in 
character.
Whether we are considering unconscious sociological cohesion 
or the power of the state, we find these forces always necessarily 
counterbalanced by the existence of other neighboring groups and 
other loyalties. There was no irrefutable constraint on man, because 
nothing absolutely good in respect to everything else had been dis­
covered. We have noted the diversity of technical form and the 
slowness of imitation. But it was always human action which was 
decisive. When several technical forms came into contact, the indi­
vidual made his choice on the basis of numerous reasons. Efficiency 
was only one of them, as Pierre Deffontaines has demonstrated in 
his work on religious geography.
The Technological Society ( 7 7
Although the individual existing in the framework of a civiliza­
tion of a certain type was always confronted with certain tech­
niques, he was nevertheless free to break with that civilization and 
to control his own individual destiny. The constraints to which he 
was subject did not function decisively because they were of a non­
technical nature and could be broken through. In an active civili­
zation, even one with a fairly good technical development, the in­
dividual could always break away and lead, say, a mystical and 
contemplative life. The fact that techniques and man were more or 
less on the same level permitted the individual to repudiate tech­
niques and get along without them. Choice was a real possibility 
for him, not only with regard to his inner life, but with regard to 
the outer form of his life as well. The essential elements of life were 
safeguarded and provided for, more or less liberally, by the very 
civilization whose forms he rejected. In the Roman Empire (a 
technical civilization in a good many respects), it was possible for 
a man to withdraw and live as a hermit or in the country, apart 
from the evolution and the principal technical power of the Em­
pire. Roman law was powerless in the face of an individual’s deci­
sion to evade military service or, to a very great degree, imperial 
taxes and jurisdiction. Even greater was the possibility of the indi­
vidual’s freedom with respect to material techniques.
There was reserved for the individual an area of free choice at 
the cost of minimal effort. The choice involved a conscious decision 
and was possible only because the material burden of technique 
had not yet become more than a man could shoulder. The existence 
of choice, a result of characteristics we have already discussed, ap­
pears to have been one of the most important historical factors gov­
erning technical evolution and revolution. Evolution was not, then, 
a logic of discovery or an inevitable progression of techniques. It 
was an interaction of technical effectiveness and effective human 
decision. Whenever either one of these elements disappeared, 
social and human stagnation necessarily followed. Such was the 
case, for example, when effective technique was (or became) rudi­
mentary and inefficacious among the Negroes of Africa. As to the 
consequences of a lapse in the second element, we are experiencing 
them today.
The New Characteristics; The characteristics of the relationship 
of technique, society, and the individual which we have analyzed
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE78 )
were, I believe, common to all civilizations up to the eighteenth 
century. Historically, their existence admits of little discussion. 
Today, however, the most cursory review enables us to conclude 
that all these characteristics have disappeared. The relation is not 
the same; it does not present any of the constants recognizable 
until now. But that is not sufficient to characterize the technical 
phenomenon of our own day. This description would situate it in a 
purely negative perspective, whereas the technical phenomemon is 
a positive thing; it presents positive characteristics which are pe­
culiar to it. The old characteristics of technique have indeed dis­
appeared; but new ones have taken their place. Today’s technical 
phenomenon, consequently, has almost nothing in common with 
the technical phenomenon of the past. I shall not insist on demon­
strating the negative aspect of the case, the disappearance of the 
traditional characteristics. To do so would be artificial, didactic, 
and difficult to defend. I shall point out, then, in a summary fash­
ion, that in our civilization technique is in no way limited. It has 
been extended to all spheres and encompasses every activity, in­
cluding human activities. It has led to a multiplication of means 
without limit. It has perfected indefinitely the instruments available 
to man, and put at his disposal an almost limitless variety of inter­
mediaries and auxiliaries. Technique has been extended geo­
graphically so that it covers the whole earth. It is evolving with a 
rapidity disconcerting not only to the man in the street but to the 
technician himself. It poses problems which recur endlessly and 
every more acutely in human social groups. Moreover, technique 
has become objective and is transmitted like a physical thing; it 
leads thereby to a certain unity of civilization, regardless of the en­
vironment or the country in which it operates. We are faced with 
the exact opposite of the traits previously in force. We must, there­
fore, examine carefully the positive characteristics of the technique 
of the present.
There are two essential characteristics of today’s technical phe­
nomenon which I shall not belabor because of their obviousness. 
These two, incidentally, are the only ones which, in general, are 
emphasized by the “best authors.”
The first of these obvious characteristics is rationality. In tech­
nique, whatever its aspect or the domain in which it is applied, a 
rational process is present which tends to bring mechanics to bear
The Technological Society ( 7 9
on all that is spontaneous or irrationaL This rationality, best exem­
plified in systematization, division of labor, creation of standards, 
production norms, and the like, involves two distinct phases: first, 
the use of “discourse” in every operation; this excludes spontaneity 
and personal creativity. Second, there is the reduction of method 
to its logical dimension alone. Every intervention of technique is, 
in effect, a reduction of facts, forces, phenomena, means, and in­
struments to the schema of logic.
The second obvious characteristic of the technical phenomenon 
is artificiality. Technique is opposed to nature. Art, artifice, artifi­
cial: technique as art is the creation of an artificial system. This is 
not a matter of opinion. The means man has at his disposal as a 
function of technique are artificial means. For this reason, the com­
parison proposed by Emmanuel Mounier between the machine 
and the human body is valueless. The world that is being created 
by the accumulation of technical means is an artificial world and 
hence radically different from the natural world.
It destroys, eliminates, or subordinates the natural world, and 
does not allow this world to restore itself or even to enter into a 
symbiotic relation with it. The two worlds obey different impera­
tives, different directives, and different laws which have nothing in 
common. Just as hydroelectric installations take waterfalls and lead 
them into conduits, so the technical milieu absorbs the natural. We 
are rapidly approaching the time when there will be no longer any 
natural environment at all. When we succeed in producing artificial 
aurorae boreales, night will disappear and perpetual day will reign 
over the planet.
I have given only brief descriptions of these two well-known 
characteristics. But I shall analyze the others at greater length; they 
are technical automatism, self-augmentation, monism, universalism, 
and autonomy.
Characteristics of Modem Technique
Automatism of Technical Choice. ‘The one best way”: so runs the 
formula to which our technique corresponds. When everything has 
been measured and calculated mathematically so that the method 
which has been decided upon is satisfactory from the rational point
80  ) THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE
of view, and when, from the practical point of view, the method if 
manifestly the most efficient of all those hitherto employed or those 
in competition with it, then the technical movement becomes self- 
directing. I call the process automatism.
There is no personal choice, in respect to magnitude, between, 
say, 3 and 4; 4 is greater than 3; this is a fact which has no personal 
reference. No one can change it or assert the contrary or personally 
escape it. Similarly, there is no choice between two technical meth­
ods. One of them asserts itself inescapably: its results are calculated, 
measured, obvious, and indisputable.
A surgical operation which was formerly not feasible but can now 
be performed is not an object of choice. It simply is. Here we see 
the prime aspect of technical automatism. Technique itself, ipso 
facto and without indulgence or possible discussion, selects among 
the means to be employed. The human being is no longer in any 
sense the agent of choice. Let no one say that man is the agent of 
technical progress (a question I shall discuss later) and that it is 
he who chooses among possible techniques. In reality, he neither 
is nor does anything of the sort. He is a device for recording effects 
and results obtained by various techniques. He does not make a 
choice of complex and, in some way, human motives. He can decide 
only in favor of the technique that gives the maximum efficiency. 
But this is not choice. A machine could effect the same operation. 
Man still appears to be choosing when he abandons a given method 
that has proved excellent from some point of view. But his action 
comes solely from the fact that he has thoroughly analyzed the re­
sults and determined that from another point of view the method 
in question is less efficient. A good example is furnished by the 
attemnts to deooneentrate our (Treat industrial plants after we had 
concentrated them to the maximum possible degree. Another ex­
ample would be the decision to abandon certain systems of high 
production in order to obtain a more constant productivity, al­
though it might be less per capita. It is always a question of the 
improvement of the method in itself.
The worst reproach modern society can level is the charge that 
some person or system is impeding this technical automatism. When 
a labor union leader says: “In a period of recession, productivity is 
a social scourge,” his declaration stirs up a storm of protest and con­
demnation, because he is putting a personal judgment before the
The TechnologictU Society ( 81
technical axiom that what can he produced must be produced. If a 
machine can yield a given result, it must be used to capacity, and it 
is considered criminal and antisocial not to do so. Technical autom­
atism may not be judged or questioned; immediate use must be 
found for the most recent, efficient, and technical process.
Communism’s fundamental criticism of capitalism is that finan­
cial capitalism checks technical progress that produces no profits; 
or that it promotes technical progress only in order to reserve for 
itself a monopoly. In any case, as Rubinstein points out, technical 
progress occurs under capitalism for reasons which have nothing to 
do with technique, and it is this fact which is to be criticized. Since 
the Communist regime is oriented toward technical progress, the 
mark of the superiority of Communism is that it adopts all technical 
progress. Rubinstein concludes his study by remarking that this 
progress is the goal of all efforts in the Soviet Union, where it is said 
to be possible to allow free play to technical automatism without 
checking it in any way.
Another traditional analysis supplements Rubinstein’s. This seri­
ous study, carried out by Thorstein Veblen, maintains that there is 
a conflict between the machine and business. Financial investment, 
which originally accelerated invention, now prolongs technical in­
activity. Capitalism does not give free play to technical activity, 
the goal of which is that a more efficient method or a more rapidly 
acting machine should ipso facto and automatically replace the pre­
ceding method or machine. Capitalism does not give free play to 
these factors because it inadmissibly subordinates technique to ends 
other than technique itself, and because it is incapable of absorbing 
technical progress. The replacement of machines at the tempo of 
technical invention is completely impossible for capitalist enter­
prise because there is no time to amortize one machine before new 
ones appear. Moreover, the more these machines are improved, and 
hence become more efficient, the more they cost.
The pursuit of technical automatism would condemn capitalist 
enterprises to failure. The reaction of capitalism is well known: 
the patents of new machines are acquired and the machines are 
never put into operation. Sometimes machines that are already in 
operation are acquired, as in the case of England’s largest glass fac­
tory in 1933, and destroyed. Capitalism is no longer in a position 
to pursue technical automatism on the economic or social plane. It
THE CHARACTEHOLOGY OF TECHNIQUE82)
is incapable of developing a system of distribution that would per­
mit the absorption of all the goods which technique allows to be 
produced. It is led inevitably to crises of overproduction. And in the 
same way it is unable to utilize the manpower freed by every new 
technical improvement. Crises of unemployment ensue.
Thus we return to the old schema of Marx: it is the automatism 
of technique, with its demand that everything be brought into line 
with it, that endangers capitalism and heralds its final disappear­
ance. This is an accurate criticism, and reveals two things. First, 
that we are correct in speaking of automatism. If the situation of 
capitalism is indeed as described, it is so because technical progress 
acts automatically. The choice between methods is no longer made 
according to human measure, but occurs as a mechanical process 
which nothing can prevent. Capitalism, in spite of all its power, 
will be crushed by this automatism. Second, that for the men of 
our time, this automatism is just and good. If Communism can 
make this critique of capitalism a successful springboard for propa­
ganda, it is only because the criticism is valid. And it is valid be­
cause everything can be called into question (God first of all), ex­
cept technical progress. There is nothing left to do but wonder at a 
mechanism that functions so well and, apparently, so tirelessly. But, 
above all else, no finger must be laid upon it, nor its automatism in­
terfered with. It is in this that the headway of technical progress 
becomes automatic; when modern man renounces control over it 
and cannot bring himself to raise his hand agaiust it so as to make 
the choice himself.
This, then, is the first aspect of technical automatism. Inside the 
technical circle, the choice among methods, mechanism, organiza­
tions, and formulas is carried out automatically. Man is stripped of 
his faculty of choice and he is satisfied. He accepts the situation 
when he sides with technique.
Let us examine the second aspect of automatism. When we leave 
the technical domain proper, we find a whole ensemble of nontech­
nical means; among them a kind of preliminary process of elimina­
tion is taking place. The various technical systems have invaded all 
spheres to the point that they are everywhere in collision with 
modes of life which were heretofore nontechnical. Human life as a 
whole is not inundated by technique. It has room for activities 
that are not rationally or systematically ordered. But the collision
The Technological Society (8 3
between spontaneous activities and technique is catastrophic for the 
spontaneous activities.
Technical activity automatically eliminates every nontechnical 
activity or transforms it into technical activity. This does not mean, 
however, that there is any conscious effort or directive will.
From the point of view which most interests modern man, that of 
yield, every technical activity is superior to every nontechnical 
activity. Take, for example, politics. It used to be said that politics 
was an art, consisting of finesse, aptness, a particular kind of ability, 
even genius; in short, of personal qualities which seemed to operate 
by chance. If politics was to become a technical activity, chance 
must be eliminated. The results to be obtained must be certain. Un­
predictability, which all men share to a greater or lesser degree, 
must also be eliminated. Rules had to be established for this par­
ticularly unstable game if certainty of result was to be achieved. 
The difficulty was great, but not greater, perhaps, than the difficulty 
involved in harnessing atomic energy.
It was Lenin who established political technique. He did not suc­
ceed in formulating a complete set of principles for it, but from the 
beginning he attained a twofold result Even a mediocre politician, 
by the application of the “method,” was able to achieve a good aver­
age policy, to ward off catastrophes, and to assure a coherent politi­
cal line. Moreover, the method was far superior to nontechnical 
policy; the same result could be obtained with fewer resources and 
with much less expense.
On the military plane, the technique applied by Hitler (and it 
was a technique, not military genius as with Napoleon— although it 
is a mark of genius to develop a technique for war or for politics) 
not only enabled him to achieve what was not necessarily a direct 
result of his technique but, more important, it enabled him to resist 
for three years an adversary who possessed approximately a fivefold 
superiority in all areas— in numbers of men and military machines, 
in economic power, and so on. This capacity to resist resulted from 
the remarkable military technique of the Gomans and from the per­
fectly developed relationship they worked out between nation and 
army.
In the same way, the political technique of Lenin’s school made, 
and is making, possible the achievement of successes over all other 
political forms, even when these political forms are able to bring
THE CHARACTEROU Of TECHNIQUE««>
infinitely superior resources to bear. The tide of Leninian policy 
retreats for certain periods before the superior weight of the enor- 
mous politico-economic machines of the opponents. But to such a 
political technique only another political technique can be opposed; 
and since the American political technique, for example, is so in­
ferior, it must deploy instead an enormous expenditure of resources. 
The superiority of a technique to enormous but inefficiently used 
resources and machinery means that the point at which technique 
inserts itself becomes a real turning point The milieu into which a 
technique penetrates becomes completely, and often at a stroke, a 
technical milieu. If a desired result is stipulated, there is no choice 
possible between technical means and nontechnical means based on 
imagination, individual qualities, or tradition. Nothing can compete 
with the technical means. The choice is made a priori. It is not in the 
power of the individual or of the group to decide to follow some 
method other than the technical The individual is in a dilemma: 
either he decides to safeguard his freedom of choice, chooses to use 
traditional, personal, moral, or empirical means, thereby entering 
into competition with a power against which there is no efficacious 
defense and before which he must suffer defeat; or he decides to 
accept technical necessity, in which case he will himself be the 
victor, but only by submitting irreparably to technical slavery. In 
effect he has no freedom of choice.
We are today at the stage of historical evolution in which every­
thing that is not technique is being eliminated. The challenge to a 
country, an individual, or a system is solely a technical challenge. 
Only a technical force can be opposed to a technical force. All else 
is swept away. Serge Tchakotin reminds us of this constantly. In 
the face of the psychological outrages of propaganda, what reply 
can there be? It is useless to appeal to culture or religion. It is use­
less to educate the populace. Only propaganda can retort to propa­
ganda, or psychological rape to psychological rape. Hitler formu­
lated this long before Tchakotin. He writes, in Mein Kampf: 
“Unless the enemy learns to combat poison gas with poison gas, this 
tactic, which is based on an accurate evaluation of human weak­
nesses, must lead almost mathematically to success.”
The exclusive character of technique gives us one of the reasons 
for its lightning progress. There is no place for an individual today 
unless he is a technician. No social group is able to resist the pres-
The Technological Society (8  5
sures of the environment unless it utilizes technique. To be in pos­
session of the lightning thrust of technique is a matter of life or 
death for individuals and groups alike; no power on earth can with­
stand its pressures.
Will the technical phenomena of today be able to maintain itself, 
or must it suffer in its turn impairment or even liquidation? It is 
difficult to see ahead, and, in any case, this is not the place to try to 
do so. Doubtless, technique has its limits. But when it has reached 
these limits, will anything exist outside them? Its limits are presup­
posed by its object and its method. But is it not succeeding in under­
mining everything which is outside it? Beyond its precise and lim­
ited compass, whatever its size, will there remain anything in exist­
ence? We shall be answering this question all through this book. 
Within the technical circle nothing else can subsist because tech­
nique’s proper motion, as Jiinger has shown, tends irresistibly to­
ward completeness. To the degree that this completeness is not yet 
attained, technique is advancing, eliminating every lesser force. 
And when it has received full satisfaction and accomplished its 
vocation, it will remain alone in the field. Technique thus reveals 
itself at once destroyer and creator, and no one wishes or is able to 
master it.
Self-augmentation. The self-augmentation of technique also has 
two aspects. At the present time, technique has arrived at such a 
point in its evolution that it is being transformed and is progressing 
almost without decisive intervention by man. Modern men are so 
enthusiastic about technique, so assured of its superiority, so im­
mersed in the technical milieu, that without exception they are 
oriented toward technical progress. They all work at it, and in every 
profession or trade everyone seeks to introduce technical improve­
ment. Essentially, technique progresses as a result of this common 
effort Technical progress and common human effort come to the 
same thing. Vincent analyzes with great subtlety the multitude of 
factors which intervene, each in its small way, in technical pro­
gress: the consumer, accumulation of capital, research bureaus and 
laboratories, and the organization of production, which acts “in 
some sense mechanically.’’ Technical progress appears to Vincent 
to be “the resultant' of all these factors. In one sense, technique 
indeed progresses by means of minute improvements which are the 
result of common human efforts and are indefinitely additive until
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE8 6)
they form a mass of new conditions that permit a decisive forward 
step. But it is equally true that technique sharply reduces the role 
of human invention. It is no longer the man of genius who discovers 
something. It is no longer the vision of a Newton which is decisive. 
What is decisive is this anonymous accretion of conditions for the 
leap ahead. When all the conditions concur, only minimal human 
intervention is needed to produce important advances. It might 
almost be maintained that, at this stage of evolution of a technical 
problem, whoever attacked the problem would find the solution.
The example of the steam engine and its manifold successive 
small alterations is well known. This example is being repeated 
today in all fields.
The accretion of manifold minute details, all tending to perfect 
the ensemble, is much more decisive than the intervention of the 
individual who assembles the new data, adds some element which 
transforms the situation, and thus gives birth to a machine or to 
some spectacular system that will bear his name.
This is the way progress takes place in the field of education, too. 
After the general direction given by initiators (like Decroly or 
Montessori), it is the findings of thousands of educators which 
ceaselessly nourish the improvement of technique. In fact, educa­
tional systems are completely transformed as a result of practice—  
without any one’s being quite aware of it. In industrial plants, the 
discovery of details is utilized in another way: to create interest on 
the part of the worker in his work. The worker is asked not only to 
use the machine he operates, but also to study it to find flaws in its 
operation, then to find remedies against these faults, and in addition 
to determine how its productivity might be improved. The result is 
the “suggestion box” by means of which workers may indicate their 
ideas and plans for improvement.
This collective, anonymous research advances techniques almost 
everywhere in the world by a like impulse, a striking result of self­
augmentation. It is noticeable that identical technical inventions are 
produced simultaneously in many countries. To the degree that 
science is taking on a more and more technical aspect, these dis­
coveries are made everywhere at the same time— a further indica­
tion that scientific discoveries are, in reality, governed by technique.
The smashing of the atom and the atomic bomb are characteris-
The Technological Society (8 7
tic of this simultaneity. In Germany, Norway, the U.S.S.R., the 
United States, and France, research had reached almost the same 
point in 1939. But circumstances upset European technical evolu­
tion and gave superiority to the United States. Among these circum­
stances were the invasion of Norway and France, the collapse of 
Germany several months after the discovery, and the lack of means 
and raw material in the U.S.S.R. What is true of scientific inventions 
is much more true of technical inventions. Only lack of means halts 
progress in certain countries. The more advanced a country is in the 
employment of technique, the more material is required, whether 
in numbers of men, raw materials, or complexity of machines. A 
country must be wealthy to exploit techniques to a maximum. And 
when the country is able to do this, technique returns a hundredfold 
increase in its wealth. This is another element in self-augmenta­
tion.
It is still necessary to justify the term self-augmentation, since it 
appears to be contradicted by what I have just been saying. If 
technical advance is assured by the joint effort of thousands of 
technicians, each of whom makes his contribution, it would seem 
impossible to speak of self-augmentation. But there is another as­
pect which must be brought to light.
There is an automatic growth (that is, a growth which is not 
calculated, desired, or chosen) of everything which concerns 
technique. This applies even to men Statistically, the number of 
scientists and technicians has doubled every decade for a century 
and a half. Apparently this is a self-generating process: technique 
engenders itself. When a new technical form appears, it makes 
possible and conditions a number of others. To take a plain and 
elementary example: the internal-combustion engine made possible 
and conditioned the techniques of the automobile, the submarine, 
and so on. In the same way, once a technical procedure has been 
discovered, it is applicable in many fields other than the one for 
which it was primarly invented. The techniques of “operational 
research,” for example, were devised to help make certain military 
decisions. But it was immediately noted that they could be ap­
plied wherever any decision had to be made. As Barache, a special­
ist in these techniques, says: “The nature of the problems them- 
•elves was secondary . . the methods of approach and the tech-
the characteholocy of technique88 )
niques employed proved to have a general scope.” The same could 
be said for the techniques of organization. There is, therefore, a self­
augmentation of the areas of application.
This does not necessarily mean an infinite or indefinite augmen­
tation of technique. I do not wish at this point to enter the realm of 
prognosis, but predictions of the more or less rapid extinction of 
technical progress seem to me to be contradicted by the facts. 
Whether it be Lewis Mumford, say, declaring that the era of 
mechanical progress is almost at an end, or Colin Clark announc­
ing the transition of secondary mechanical activities to tertiary ac­
tivities, they are exhibiting what can only be termed a dangerous 
confidence.
Lewis Mumford shows that certain of our inventions cannot be 
improved, that the possible domain of mechanical activity cannot 
be extended, and that mechanical progress is limited by the nature 
of the physical world. This last is true. But we are far from knowing 
the total possibilities of the physical world. And after Mumford had 
written that statement fifteen years ago, servomechanisms, radar, 
and atom smashing were discovered. It is obvious that the augmen­
tation of machines cannot be unlimited. But, so as not to rest our 
hopes on an alleged stagnation, it will be enough for this progress 
to continue for another century.
What is true of mechnical techniques is also true of economic 
techniques. I agree fully with the remarks of Leon Hugo Dupriez 
when he points out the error of the “stagnationist?”— of Wolf, for 
example, who writes: "The law of the limit of technico-economic 
development is that past progress closes the door to future progress. 
For future progress there remains in every case only a margin, only a 
fraction, indeed only a small fraction, of past progress.” Dupricz's 
exposure of the error of statements like this seems to me so con­
vincing that I shall content myself with referring the reader to his 
work.
On the other hand, Lewis Mumford shows (and, from another 
perspective, this is also Colin Clark’s thought) that the best organi­
zation will tend to reduce the use of certain machines. This is 
rigorously exact. But this “best organization” is precisely technique 
itself and, moreover, it comprises a mechanical element as well. 
When Fourastie announces an augmentation of the tertiary, non- 
mechanized sector, the extraordinary progress of administrative
The Technological Society (8 9
mechanization of the last ten years must be considered. This mecha­
nization completely modifies the conditions of human work by 
what has been termed "the replacement of the organic and the 
psychological by the mechanical.” It is certain that this fact will 
entail the same social crisis of unemployment as in the “secondary” 
sector. To take an example, the tabulator adds and prints 45,000 
numbers an hour (as compared with 1,500 for a trained employee). 
It reads, calculates, analyzes, and prints 150 lines a minute. A 
punching machine, attached to it, produces the punched cards 
which recapitulate the results. The Gamma (a magnetic-drum 
machine) has a “memory” with a capacity for 200,000 individual 
items of data. A 1960-model calculating machine can handle 40,000 
operations a second. The machine, along with organizational devel­
opment, is now the means of reducing both the number of em­
ployees and expenses, and also of reducing, on the collective plane, 
the tertiary sector of manpower.
We can hardly agree that mechanical augmentation is decelerat­
ing. We are simply in another phase of technical progress: the 
phase of assimilation, organization, and conquest of the other areas. 
Here the progress to be made seems limitless, and consists primarily 
in the efficient systematization of society and the conquest of the 
human being. All that can be said is that, at best, technical activity 
has changed its field of operation; it cannot be said that it has slowed 
down.
Moreover, nothing argues that subsequently technical activity 
will not again turn toward the world of machines with renewed 
vigor. On the whole, it is the principle of the combination of tech­
niques which causes self-augmentation.
Self-augmentation can be formulated in two laws:
1. In a given civilization, technical progress is irreversible.
2. Technical progress tends to act, not according to an arith­
metic, but according to a geometric progression.
The first of these laws— and we base our conviction on the whole 
of history— makes us certain that every invention calls forth other 
technical inventions in other domains. There is never any question 
of an arrest of the process, and even less of a backward movement 
Arrest and retreat only occur when an entire society collapses. In 
the transition to a successor, a certain number of technical proce 
dures are lost. But, in the framework of the same civilization.
THE CHARACTEBOUXJY OF TECHNIQUE90 )
technical progress is never in question. Later I shall examine the 
reasons for this. Technical progression is of the same nature as the 
process of numbering; there is no good ground for halting the pro­
gression, because after each number we can always add 1. In tech­
nical evolution also, it seems that limits no longer exist Improve­
ments that result from the application of technique to the matter 
at hand (whether it be physical or social) can be added uninter­
ruptedly; there is no reason for arresting the process. In arguing 
thus, the qualification must be made that this can be said only of the 
ensemble of techniques, of the technical phenomenon, and not 
of any particular technique. For every technique taken by itself 
there apparently exist barriers that act to impede further progress, 
barriers to the addition of new inventions— but these can sometimes 
be cleared, as the sound barrier has been for aircraft. For the tech­
nical phenomenon in its ensemble, however, a limitless progress is 
open. This progress, as Wiener has shown, is a necessity. Since 
techniques, proportionally to their development, exhaust the re­
sources of nature, it is indispensable to fill the vacuum so created 
by a more rapid technical progress. Only inventions perpetually 
more numerous and automatically increasing can make good the 
unheard-of expenditures and the irremediable consumption of raw 
materials such as wood, coal, petroleum, and even water.
What is it that determines this progression today? We can no 
longer argue that it is an economic or a social condition, or educa­
tion, or any other human factor. Essentially, the preceding tech­
nical situation alone is determinative. When a given technical 
discovery occurs, it has followed almost of necessity certain other 
discoveries. Human intervention in this succession appears only as 
an incidental cause, and no one man can do this by himself. But 
anyone who is sufficiently up-to-date technically can make a valid 
discovery which rationally follows its predecessors and rationally 
heralds what is to follow.
Two points must be made more precise here. First, the tech­
nical consequences of a technical improvement are not necessarily 
of a kind. Thus, a purely mechanical discovery may have repercus­
sions in the domain of social techniques or in that of organizational 
techniques. For example, machines that use perforated cards affect 
statistics and the organization of certain business enterprises. Con-
The Technological Society (g i
versely, some kind of social technique (for instance, full employ­
ment) may entail an improvement in the techniques of economic 
production.
Here we note the interdependence of techniques which is stated 
in the second law of self-augmentation: technical progress tends to 
be brought about according to a geometric progressioa A technical 
discovery has repercussions and entails progress in several branches 
of technique and not merely in one. Moreover, techniques combine 
with one another, and the more given techniques there are to be 
combined, the more combinations are possible. Thus, almost with­
out deliberate will, by a simple combination of new data, incessant 
discoveries take place everywhere; and whole fields are opened up 
to technique because of the meeting of several currents. Material 
techniques of communication, psychological techniques, commer­
cial techniques, techniques of authoritarian government, all com­
bine to produce the important phenomenon of propaganda, which 
represents a new technique independent of all the rest and neces­
sarily produced as a consequence of the preceding phenomena.
This second law of self-augmentation explains a characteristic of 
the technical movement which has engaged the attention of con­
temporary sociologists. This is the unevenness of technical develop­
ment. Enormous disparities exist not only in the various global areas 
of technical expansion but also in each field within the various sec­
tors. Technique progresses more rapidly in one branch than in 
another— and certain retrogressions are always possible. To Frankel 
this unevenness of development is the key to the disturbances of 
equilibrium and the social difficulties that the technical phenom­
enon provokes. According to Frankel, if all branches evolved in the 
same rhythm, there would be no problem. Frankel’s view, certainly 
too simple, is probably not inexact. However, it explains little. In 
fact, these clashing rhythms cannot be altered because of tech­
nical automatism.
Fourastie is right in arguing that technical progress is unpredict­
able. It cannot be known with certainty even a short time in advance 
in what quarter the new technical invention will be produced, 
precisely because such inventions are, for the most part, the result 
of self-augmentation. (Of course, a distinction must be made be­
tween invention and discovery.) Short of halting progress by force
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE9* )
in an advanced sector, there are no means of bringing these rhythms 
back into harmony; and the role of the individual is progressively 
weakened.
The final point to make in discussing self-augmentation is that 
technique, in its development, poses primarily technical problems 
which consequently can be resolved only by technique. The present 
level of technique brings on new advances, and these in turn add to 
existing technical difficulties and technical problems, which de­
mand further advances still. This is a concrete problem in town 
planning. A large city supposes a concentration of the means of 
transport, air control, traffic organization, and so on. Each of these 
permits the city to grow even larger and promotes new technical 
advances. For example, to make housework easier, garbage-disposal 
units have been put into use which allow the garbage to run off 
through the kitchen sinks. The result is enormous pollution of the 
rivers. It is then necessary to find some new means of purifying the 
rivers so that water can be used for drinking. A great quantity of 
oxygen is required for bacteria to destroy these organic materials. 
And how shall we oxygenate rivers? This is an example of the way 
in which technique engenders itself.
The mechanization of administrative work in business offices 
raises the problem of a necessarily different kind of organization. 
It is not merely a question of replacing human beings with machines 
or of speeding up the work (of bookkeeping, for example), but 
rather of effecting operations of a new type which must be inte­
grated into a new kind of organization. For example, the organiza­
tion of the whole system of inventory analysis (with its four func­
tions of entering, grouping, totaling, and comparing) becomes 
necessary. An ensemble of new techniques must be elaborated with­
out which the machine in question would be good for nothing, 
resulting only in what Mas terms “pseudo-systematization."
The implications of self-augmentation become clearer: the in­
dividual's role is less and less important in technical evolution. 
The more factors there are, the more readily they combine and the 
more evident is the urgent need for each technical advance. 
Advance for its own sake becomes proportionately greater and 
the expression of human autonomy proportionately feebler.
Human beings are, indeed, always necessary. But literally anyone
The Technological Society (9 3
can do the job, provided he is trained to it. Henceforth, men will be 
able to act only in virtue of their commonest and lowest nature, 
and not in virtue of what they possess of superiority and individ­
uality. The qualities which technique requires for its advance are 
precisely those characteristics of a technical order which do not 
represent individual intelligence. And here we enter into another 
area, the nature of the technician.
In this decisive evolution, the human being does not play a part. 
Technical elements combine among themselves, and they do so 
more and more spontaneously. In the future, man will apparently 
be confined to the role of a recording device; he will note the effects 
of techniques upon one another, and register the results.
A whole new kind of spontaneous action is taking place here, and 
we know neither its laws nor its ends. In this sense it is possible to 
speak of the “reality” of technique— with its own substance, its own 
particular mode of being, and a life independent of our power of 
decision. The evolution of techniques then becomes exclusively 
causal; it loses all finality. This is what economists such as Alfred 
Sauvy mean when they say that "by a slow reversal . . . produc­
tion is more and more determined by the wishes of individuals in 
their capacity as producers, than by their decisions as consumers.” 
In reality, it is not the “wishes” of the “producers’  which control, 
but the technical necessity of production which forces itself on the 
consumers. Anything and everything which technique is able to 
produce is produced and accepted by the consumer. The belief 
that the human producer is still master of production is a dangerous 
illusion.
Technique is organized as a closed world. It utilizes what Hie 
mass of men do not understand. It is even based on human igno­
rance. As Charles Camichel says: “ The worker cannot understand 
the workings of modem industry.” The individual, in order to make 
use of technical instruments, no longer needs to know about his 
civilization. And no single technician dominates the whole com­
plex any longer. The bond that unites the fragmentary actions and 
disjointedness of individuals, co-ordinating and systematizing their 
work, is no longer a human one, but the internal laws of technique. 
The human hand no longer spans the complex of means, nor does 
the human brain synthesize man’s acts. Only the intrinsic monism
THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE94)
of technique assures cohesion between human means and acts. 
Technique reigns alone, a blind force and more clear-sighted than 
the best human intelligence.
This phenomenon of self-augmentation gives technique a 
strangely harsh aspect. It resembles nothing other than itself. What­
ever the domain to which it is applied, man or Cod, technique 
simply is; it undergoes no modifications in the movement which 
is its being and essence. It is the only locus where form and 
being are identical. It is only a form, but everything conforms to it. 
Here technique assumes the peculiar characteristics which make it 
a thing apart. A precise and well-defined boundary surrounds it: 
there is that which is technique, and there is everything else, which 
is not. Whoever passes this boundary and enters into technique is 
constrained to adopt its characteristics. Technique modifies what­
ever it touches, but it is itself untouchable. Nothing in nature, or in 
social or human life, is comparable with it. The intelligence of art or 
war comes nowhere near that of technique, no more than does the 
industry of ants or bees. A hybrid but not sterile being, and capable 
of self-generation, technique traces its own limits and fashions its 
own image.
Whatever the adaptations nature or circumstances demand of it, 
technique remains self-identical in its characteristics and its course. 
Hindrances seem to compel it to become, not something else, but 
even more itself. Everything it assimilates strengthens it in its 
traits. There is no hope of seeing it change into a fine and gracious 
being: it is neither Caliban nor Ariel, but it has been able to take 
Ariel and Caliban into the unconditioned circles of its universal 
method.
M on ismThe technical phenomenon, embracing all the 
separate techniques, forms a whole. This monism of technique was 
already obvious to us when we determined, on the basis of the 
evidence, that the technical phenomenon presents, every­
where and essentially, the same characteristics. It is useless to look 
for differentiations. They do exist, but only secondarily. The 
common features of the technical phenomenon are so sharply
* The French word is tmictti or InxScabiliti. I have adopted “m onism ” as the Eng­
lish equivalent. "Holism” might have been better. In any case, the accumulated 
philosophical baggage of both these term s m ust be rejected and the meaning of the 
term  understood contextually. (Trans.)

drawn that it is easy to discern that which is the technical phenom­
enon and that which is not The difficulties experienced in the study 
of technique arise partly from the method to be used and partly 
from terminology. They do not arise from the phenomenon itself, 
which is eminently simple to fix.
To analyze these common features is tricky, but it is simple to 
grasp them. Just as there are principles common to things as dif­
ferent as a wireless set and an internal-combustion engine, so the 
organization of an office and the construction of an aircraft have 
certain identical features. This identity is the primary mark of that 
thoroughgoing unity which makes the technical phenomenon a 
single essence despite the extreme diversity of its appearances.
As a corollary, it is impossible to analyze this or that element out 
of it— a truth which is today particularly misunderstood. The great 
tendency of all persons who study techniques is to make distinc­
tions. They distinguish between the different elements of technique, 
maintaining some and discarding others. They distinguish between 
technique and the use to which it is put. These distinctions are 
completely invalid and show only that he who makes them has 
understood nothing of the technical phenomenon. Its parts are 
ontologically tied together; in it, use is inseparable from being.
It is common practice, for example, to deny the unity of the 
technical complex so as to be able to fasten one’s hopes on one or 
another of its branches. Mumford gives a remarkable example of 
this when he contrasts the grandeur of the printing press with the 
horridness of the newspaper. “On the one side there is the gigantic 
printing press, a miracle of fine articulation . . . On the other the 
content of the papers themselves recording the most vulgar and 
elementary emotional states . . . There the impersonal, the co­
operative, the objective; here the limited, the subjective, the recalci­
trant, the ego, violent and full of hate and fear, etc. . . .” Unfortu­
nately, it did not occur to Mumford to ask whether the content of 
our newspapers is not really necessitated by the social form imposed 
on man by the machine.
This content is not the product of chance or of some economic 
form. It is the result of precise psychological and psychoanalytical 
techniques. These techniques have as their goal the bringing to the 
individual of that which is indispensable for his satisfaction in the 
conditions in which the machine has placed him, of inhibiting in
THE CHARACIEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE96 )
him the sense of revolution, of subjugating him by flattering him. 
In other words, journalistic content is a technical complex expressly 
intended to adapt the man to the machine.
It is certain that a press of high intellectual tone and great moral 
elevation either would not be read ( and then one would scarcely 
see the wherefore of these beautiful machines) or would provoke 
in the long run a violent reaction against every form of technical 
society, including the machine. This reaction would come about not 
because of the ideas such a press would disseminate, but because 
the reader would no longer find in it the indispensable instrument 
for releasing his repressed passions.
In a sound evaluation of the problem, it ought never to be said: 
on the one side, technique; on the other, the abuse of it There are 
different techniques which correspond to different necessities. But 
all techniques are inseparably united. Everything hangs together 
in the technical world, as it does in the mechanical; in both, the 
advisability of the isolated means must be distinguished from the 
advisability of the mechanical ‘‘complex.’*  The claims of the me­
chanical “complex' must prevail when, for example, a machine too 
costly or overrefined threatens to wreck the ensemble.
There is an attractive notion which would apparently resolve 
all technical problems: that it is not the technique that is wrong, but 
the use men make of it. Consequently, if the use is changed, there 
will no longer be any objection to the technique.
I shall return more than once to this conception. Let us examine a 
single aspect of it now. First, it manifestly rests on the confusion 
between machine and technique. A man can use his automobile to 
take a trip or to kill his neighbors. But the second use is not a use; it 
is a crime. The automobile was not created to kill people, so the fact 
is nut important. 1 know, of course, that killing people is not what 
those wiho explain things in this way have in mind. They prefer to 
say that man orients his pursuits in the direction of good and not of 
evil. They mean that technique seeks to invent rational therapies 
and not poison gases, useful sources of energy and not atomic 
bombs, commercial and not military aircraft, etc. This leads them 
straight back to man— man who decides in what direction to orient 
his researches. (Must it not be, then, that man is becoming better?) 
But all this is an error. It resolutely refuses to recognize technical 
reality. It supposes, to begin with, that men orient technique in a
The Technological Society ( 9 7
given direction for moral, and consequently nontechnical, reasons. 
But a principal characteristic of technique (which we shall 
study at length) is its refusal to tolerate moral judgments. It is 
absolutely independent of them and eliminates them from its 
domain. Technique never observes the distinction between moral 
and immoral use. It tends, on the contrary, to create a completely 
independent technical morality.
Here, then, is one of the elements of weakness of this point of 
view. It does not perceive technique’s rigorous autonomy with 
respect to morals; it does not see that the infusion of some more or 
less vague sentiment of human welfare cannot alter it. Not even the 
moral conversion of the technicians could make a difference. At 
best, they would cease to be good technicians.
This attitude supposes further that technique evolves with some 
end in view, and that this end is human good. Technique, as I 
believe I have shown, is totally irrelevant to this notion and pursues 
no end, professed or unprofessed. It evolves in a purely causal 
way: the combination of preceding elements furnishes the new 
technical elements. There is no purpose or plan that is being pro­
gressively realized. There is not even a tendency toward human 
ends. We are dealing with a phenomenon blind to the future, in a 
domain of integral causality. Hence, to pose arbitrarily some goal or 
other, to propose a direction for technique, is to deny technique and 
divest it of its character and its strength.
There is a final argument against this position. It was said that 
die use made of technique is bad. But this assertion has no meaning 
at all. As I have pointed out, a number of uses can always be made 
of the machine, but only one of them is the technical use. The use of 
the automobile as a murder weapon does not represent the tech­
nical use, that is, the one best way of doing something. Technique is 
a means with a set of rules for die game. It is a ‘ method of being 
used” which is unique and not open to arbitrary choice; we gain no 
advantage from the machine or from organization if it is not used as 
it ought to be. There is but one method for its use, one possibility. 
Lacking this, it is not a technique. Technique is in itself a method 
of action, which is exacdy what a use means. To say of such a 
technical means that a bad use has been made of it is to say that no 
technical use has been made of it, that it has not been made to 
yield what it could have yielded and ought to have yielded. The
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OP TECHNIQUE9 &  )
driver who uses his automobile carelessly makes a bad use of it. 
Such use, incidentally, has nothing to do with the use which 
moralists wish to ascribe to technique. Technique is a use. Moralists 
wish to apply another use, with other criteria. What they wish, to be 
precise, is that technique no longer be technique. Under the cir­
cumstances, there are no further significant problems.
There is no difference at all between technique and its use. 
The individual is faced with an exclusive choice, either to use the 
technique as it should be used according to the technical rules, or 
not to use it at all It is impossible to use it otherwise than according 
to the technical rules.
Unfortunately, men today accept this reality only with difficulty. 
Thus, when Mumford makes the statement: "The army is the 
ideal form towards which a purely mechanical industrial system 
must tend,” he is unable to restrain himself from adding: “But the 
result is not ideal.” What is the “ideal" doing here? The ideal is not 
the problem. The problem is solely to know whether this mode of 
organization responds to technical criteria. Mumford is able to 
show that it is nothing of the kind, because he limits techniques to 
machines. But if he were to accept the role of human techniques in 
the organization of the army he could account for the fact that the 
army indeed remains the irreproachable model of a technical 
organization, and its value has nothing to do with an ideal. It is 
infantile to wish to submit the machine to the criterion of the ideal.
It is also held that technique could be directed toward that which 
is pusilive, constructive, and enriching, omitting that which is 
negative, destructive, and impoverishing. In demagogic formula­
tion, techniques of peace must be developed and techniques of 
war rejected. In a less simple-minded version, it is held that means 
ought to be sought which palliate, without increasing, the draw­
backs of technique. Could not atomic engines and atomic power 
have been discovered without creating the bomb? To reason thus is 
to separate technical elements with no justification. Techniques of 
peace and alongside them other and different techniques of war 
simply do not exist, despite what good folk think to the contrary.
The organization of an army comes to resemble more and more 
that of a great industrial plant. It is the technical phenomenon 
presenting a formidable unity in all its parts, which are inseparable. 
The fact that the atomic bomb was created before the atomic
The Technological Society (99
engine was not essentially the result of the perversity of technical men. Nor was it solely the attitude of the state which determined this order. The action of the state was certainly the deciding factor in atomic research (I shall take up this point later). Research was greatly accelerated by the necessities of war and consequently directed toward a bomb. If the state had not been oriented toward the ends of war, it would not have devoted so much money to atomic research. All this caused an undeniable factor of orientation to intervene. But if the state had not promoted such efforts, it would have been the whole complex of atomic research which would have been halted without distinction between the uses of war and peace.If atomic research is encouraged, it is obligatory to pass through the stage of the atomic bomb; the bomb represents by far the sim­plest utilization of atomic energy. The problems involved in the military use of atomic energy are infinitely more simple to resolve than are those involved in its industrial use. For industrial use, all the problems involved in the bomb must be solved, and in addition certain others, a fact corroborated by J. Robert Oppenheimer in his Paris lecture of 1958. The experience of Great Britain between 
1955 and i960 in producing electricity of nuclear origin is very significant in this respect.It was, then, necessary to pass through the period of research which culminated in the bomb before proceeding to its normal sequel, atomic motive power. The atomic-bomb period is a transi­tory, but unfortunately necessary, stage in the general evolution of this technique. In the interim period represented by the bomb, the possessor, finding himself with so powerful an instrument, is led to use it. Why? Because everything which is technique is necessarily used as soon as it is available, without distinction of good or evil. This is the principal law of our age. We may quote here Jacques Soustelle’s well-known remark of May, i960, in reference to the atomic bomb. It expresses the deep feeling of us all: “Since 
it was possible, it was necessary/* Really a master phrase for all technical evolution.Even an author as well disposed toward the machine as Mumford recognizes that there is a tendency to utilize all inventions whether there is need for them or not. “Our grandparents used sheet iron for walls although they knew that iron is a good conductor of
THE CHARACTEROLOCY Or TECHNIQUE100  )
heat . . . The introduction of anesthetics led to the performance 
of superfluous operations. ..."  To say that it could be otherwise 
is simply to make an abstraction of man.
Another example is the police. The police have perfected to an 
unheard of degree technical methods both of research and of action. 
Everyone is delighted with this development because it would seem 
to guarantee an increasingly efficient protection against criminals. 
Let us put aside for the moment the problem of police corruption 
and concentrate on the technical apparatus, which, as I have 
noted, is becoming extremely precise. Will this apparatus be ap­
plied only to criminals? We know that this is not the case; and we 
are tempted to react by saying that it is the state which applies this 
technical apparatus without discrimination. But there is an error 
of perspective here. The instrument tends to be applied everywhere 
it can be applied. It functions without discrimination— because it 
exists without discrimination. The techniques of the police, which 
are developing at an extremely rapid tempo, have as their neces­
sary end the transformation of the entire nation into a concentra­
tion camp. This is no perverse decision on the part of some party or 
government. To be sure of apprehending criminals, it is necessary 
that everyone be supervised. It is necessary to know exactly what 
every citizen is up to, to know his relations, his amusements, etc. 
And the state is increasingly in a position to know these things.
This does not imply a reign of terror or of arbitrary arrests. The 
best technique is one which makes itself felt the least and which 
represents the least burden. But every citizen must be thoroughly 
known to the police and must live under conditions of discreet 
surveillance. All this results from the perfection of technical meth­
ods.
The police cannot attain technical perfection unless they have 
total control. And, as Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt has remarked, this 
total control has both an objective and a subjective side. Sub­
jectively, control satisfies the desire for power and certain sadistic 
tendencies. But the subjective aspect is not the dominant one. It is 
not the major aspect, the expression of what is to come. In reality, 
the objective aspect of control— more and more, that is to say, the 
pure technique which creates a milieu, an atmosphere, an environ­
ment, and even a model of behavior in social relations— dominates 
more and more. The police must move in the direction of anticipat-
The Technological Society (101
ing and forestalling crime. Eventually intervention will be useless. 
This state of affairs can come about in two ways: first, by constant 
surveillance, to the end that noxious intentions be known in advance 
and the police be able to act before the premeditated crime takes 
place; second, by the climate of social conformity which we have 
mentioned. This goal presupposes the paternal surveillance of every 
citizen and, in addition, the closest possible tie-in with all other 
techniques— administrative, organizational, and psychological. The 
technique of police control has value only if the police are in close 
contact with the trade unions and the schools. In particular, it is 
allied with propaganda. Wherever the phenomenon is observed, 
this connection exists. Propaganda itself cannot be efficient unless 
it brings into play the whole state organization, and particularly the 
police power. Conversely, police power is a genuine technique only 
when it is supplemented by propaganda, which plays a leading role 
in the psychological environment necessary to the completeness of 
the police power. But propaganda must also teach acceptance of 
what the police power is and what it can do. It must make the police 
power palatable, justify its actions, and give it its psychosociological 
structure among the masses of the people.
All this is equally true for dictatorial regimes in which police 
and propaganda concentrate on terror, and for democratic regimes 
in which the motion pictures, for example, show the good offices 
of the police and procure it the friendly feeling of the public. The 
vicious circle mentioned by Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt (past terror 
accentuates present propaganda, and present propaganda paves 
the way for future terror) is as true of democratic as of dictatorial 
regimes, if the term terror is replaced by efficiency.
This type of police organization is not an arbitrary prospect. It is 
maintained by every authoritarian government, where every citizen 
is regarded as a suspect ignorant of his own capabilities. It is the 
tendency in the United States, and we are beginning to see the first 
elements of it in France. The administration of the French police 
was oriented, in 1951, toward an organization of the system “in 
depth.” This took place, for example, at the level of the Record 
Office. Certain elements of this are simple and well known: finger­
print files, records of firearms, application of statistical methods 
which allow the police to obtain in a minimum of time the most 
varied kinds of information and to know from day to day the current
THE CHAHACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE10 2 )
state of criminality in all its forms. Other elements are somewhat 
more complicated and new. For example, a punched-card mechan­
ical index system (Recherches) has been installed in the Criminal 
Division. This system oifers four hundred possible combinations 
and permits investigations to begin with any element of the 
crime: hour of commission, nature, objects stolen, weapons used, 
etc. The combination obviously does not give the solution but a 
series of approximations.
The most important item in this catalogue of police techniques is 
the creation of the so-called “suspect files,” which show whether the 
police ever suspected any individual for any reason or at any time 
whatsoever, even though no legal document or procedure ever 
existed against him ( from the press conference of M. Baylot, Pre­
fect of Police, 1951). This means that any citizen who, once in his 
life, had anything to do with the police, even for noncriminal rea­
sons, is put under observation— a fact which ought to affect, speak­
ing conservatively, half the adult male population. It is obvious 
that these lists are only a point of departure, because it will be 
tempting, as well as necessary, to complete the files with all observa­
tions which may have been collected.
Finally, this technical conception of the police supposes the 
institution of concentration camps, not in their dramatic aspects, 
but in their administrative aspects. The Nazi’s use of concentration 
camps has warped our perspectives. The concentration camp is 
based on two ideas which derive directly from the technical con­
ception of the police: preventive detention (which completes pre­
vention), and re-education. It is not because the use of these terms 
has not corresponded to reality that we feel it necessary to refuse to 
see in the concentration camp a very advanced form of the system. 
Nor is it because the so-called methods of re-education have, on the 
whole, been methods of destruction that we feel we must consider 
such a concept of “re-education” an odious joke. The further we 
advance, the more will the police be considered responsible for the 
re-education of social misfits, a goal that is a part of the very order 
which they are charged with protecting.
We are experiencing at present the justification of this develop­
ment. It is not true that the perfection of police power is the result 
of the state’s Machiavellianism or of some transitory influence. The 
whole structure of society implies it, of necessity. The more we mo-
The Technological Society (103
bilize the forces of nature, the more must we mobilize men and the 
more do we require order, which today represents the highest value. 
To deny this is to deny the whole course of modem times. This 
order has nothing spontaneous in it. It is rather a patient accretion 
of a thousand technical details. And each of us derives a feeling of 
security from every one of the improvements which make this 
order more efficient and the future safer. Order receives our com* 
plete approval; even when we are hostile to the police, we are, by a 
strange contradiction, partisans of order. In the blossoming of 
modem discoveries and of our own power, a vertigo has taken hold 
of us which makes us feel this need to an extreme degree. After all, 
it is the police who are charged, from die external point of view, 
with insuring this order which covers organization and morals. How 
then can we possibly deny to the police indispensable improve­
ments in their methods? •
We in France are still in the preparatory phase of this develop­
ment, but the organization of police power has been pushed very 
far in Canada and New Zealand, to take two examples. Technical 
necessity imposes the national concentration camp (which, I must 
point out, does not involve the suffering usually associated with it).
Let us take another example. A new machine of great productive 
power put into circulation “releases” a great quantity of work; it 
replaces many workers. This is an inevitable consequence of tech­
nique. In the crude order of things, these workers are simply thrown 
out of work. Capitalism is blamed for tlus state of affairs and we 
are told that technique itself is not responsible for technological 
unemployment and that the establishment of socialism would set 
things right. The capitalist replies: “Technological unemployment 
always dies out of itself. For example, it creates certain new activi­
ties which will in the long run create employment for qualified 
workers.” This appears to be a dreadful prospect because it implies 
a readaptation in time and a more or less lengthy period of un­
employment. But what does socialism propose? That the “liberated” 
worker will be used somewhere else and in some other capacity. 
In the Soviet Union the worker is either adapted to a new skill 
by means of vocational training or he is sent to another part of the 
country. In the Beveridge Plan the worker is employed wherever 
the state opens a plant of any sort. This socialist solution involves 
readaptation in space. But this solution, too, appears to be com-
THE CHARACTEHOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE104)
pletely alien to human nature. Man is not a mere package to be 
moved about, an object to be molded and applied wherever there is 
need. These two forms of readaptation, the only ones possible, 
are both inhumane. The New Work Code promulgated in the 
(East) German Democratic Republic in November, i960, shows 
this inhumanity in operation in the socialist camp. And none of 
these adaptations can be separated from the machine which re­
places human labor. They are its necessary and inevitable conse­
quence. Of course, idealists will speak of the reduction of the work 
week. But this reduction can only be effected when equivalent 
technical improvements are produced in all fields of work. Accord­
ing to Colin Clark, it seems that this reduction, too, must “ceiling 
out” before long. But this consideration passes over into the area 
of economics.
I could cite innumerable examples, but the ones I have given 
suffice to show that technique in itself (and not the use made of it, 
or its non-necessary consequences) leads to a certain amount of 
suffering and to social scourges which cannot be completely sepa­
rated from it. This is its very mechanism.
Of course, a technique can be abandoned when it proves to have 
evil effects which were not provided for. From then on, there will 
be an improvement in the technique. A characteristic example is 
furnished by J. de Castro in The Geography of Hunger. De Castro 
shows in detail, with regard to Brazil, what was already known 
superficially about other countries, that certain techniques of ex­
ploitation have proved disastrous. According to de Castro, certain 
regions were deforested in order to grow sugar cane. But only the 
immediate technical productivity was considered. In a further 
work, de Castro seeks to show that the hunger problem was created

His reasoning, however, is correct only to a very limited extent. It 
is true that when an agriculture of diversified crops is replaced by 
a single-crop economy for commercial ends (tobacco and sugar 
cane), capitalism is to blame. But most often crop diversification is 
not disturbed. What happens is that new areas are brought under 
cultivation, producing a population increase and also a unilateral 
utilization of the labor forces. And this is less a capitalist than a 
technical fact. If the possibility of industrializing agriculture exists, 
why not use it? Any engineer, agronomist, or economist of a hun-
The Technological Society ( 10 5
dred years ago would have agreed that bringing uncultivated 
lands under cultivation constituted a great advance. The applica­
tion of European agricultural techniques represented an incom­
parable forward step, when compared, for example, to Indian 
methods. But it involved certain unforeseen consequences: the re­
sulting deforestation modified hydrographic features, the rivers 
became torrents, and the drainage waters provoked catastrophic 
erosion. The topsoil was completely carried away and agriculture 
became impossible. The fauna, dependent on the existence of the 
forest, disappeared. In this way, the food-producing possibilities of 
vast regions vanished. The same situation is developing as a result 
of the cultivation of peanuts in Senegal, of cotton in the South of 
the United States, and so on. None of this represents, as is com­
monly said, a poor application of technique— one guided by selfish 
interest. It is simply technique. And if the situation is rectified “too 
late" by the abandonment of the old technique, it will only be as a 
consequence of some new technical advance. In any case, the first 
step was inevitable; man can never foresee the totality of conse­
quences of a given technical action. History shows that every tech­
nical application from its beginnings presents certain unforeseeable 
secondary effects which are much more disastrous than the lack of 
the technique would have been. These effects exist alongside those 
effects which were foreseen and expected and which represent 
something valuable and positive.
Technique demands the most rapid possible application; the 
problems of our day are evolving rapidly and require immediate 
solutions. Modern man is held by the throat by certain demands 
which will not be resolved simply by the passage of time. The 
quickest possible counter-thrust, often a matter of life or death, is 
necessary. When the parry specific to the attack is found, it is used. 
It would be foolish not to use the available means. But there is 
never time to estimate all the repercussions. And, in any case, they 
are most often unforeseeable. The more we understand the inter­
relation of all disciplines and the interaction of the instruments, 
the less time there is to measure these effects accurately.
Moreover, technique demands the most immediate application 
because it is so expensive. It must “pay off,” in money, prestige, 
or force (depending on whether the regime is capitalist, Com­
munist, or Fascist, respectively). There is no time for precautions
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE106)
when the distribution of dividends or the salvation of the prole­
tariat is at stake. Nor can we permit ourselves to say that these 
motives are no affair of technique. If none of them existed, there 
would be no money for technical research and there would be no 
technique. Technique cannot be considered in itself, apart from its 
actual modes of existence.
We are brought back, then, to serious facts of this order: in 
certain agricultural research in England, antiparasitic agents called 
systemics were applied. An injection was made into a fruit tree, 
which as a consequence was infected with the agent from its 
roots to its leaves. Every parasite died. But nothing is known of the 
effects on the fruit, or of the effects on man, and in the long run of 
the effects on the tree. All that is known is that the agent is not an 
immediate deadly poison for the consumer. Such products are al­
ready commercially available, and it is probable that they will 
shortly be used on a large scale. What we have said about systemics 
holds for the specific insecticide, D.D.T. It was announced origi­
nally that this insecticide was completely harmless for warm­
blooded animals. Subsequently, D.D.T. was widely used. But it 
was noted in 1951 that D.D.T. in fatty solution (oily or otherwise) 
is actually a poison for warm-blooded animals and causes a whole 
complex of disturbances and diseases, in particular, rickets. This 
fatty solution may be produced entirely by accident, as when cows 
treated with this chemical produce milk containing D.D.T. Rickets 
has been detected in calves nourished with such milk. And several 
international medical congresses since 1956 have drawn attention 
to the grave danger to children.
But the real question is not the question of error. Errors are 
always possible. Two facts alone concern us: it is impossible to 
foresee all the consequences of a technical action; and technique 
demands that everything it produces be brought into a domain that 
affects the entire public.
The weight of technique is such that no obstacle can stop it. And 
every technical advance is matched by a negative reverse side. An 
excellent study of the effect of petroleum explorations in the Sahara 
(1958) concludes with the observation that the most serious prob­
lem is the increase in the wretchedness of the local population. The 
causes of this growing misery, among others, are: the supplanting of 
caravan traffic by motor vehicles; the disappearance of the date
The Technological Society (107
palms (diseased through widespread chemical wastes); and the 
disappearance of cereal grains because of nonmaintenance of the 
irrigation works. This complex seems to represent a typical example.
The human being is delivered helpless, in respect to life’s most 
important and most trivial affairs, to a power which is in no sense 
under his control. For there can be no question today of man’s con­
trolling the milk he drinks or the bread he eats, any more than of his 
controlling his government. The same holds for the development of 
great industrial plants, transport systems, motion pictures, and so 
on. It is only after a period of dubious experimentation that a tech­
nique is refined and its secondary consequences are modified 
through a series of technical improvements. Henceforth, someone 
will say, it will be possible to tame the monster and separate the 
good results of a technical operation from the bad. That may be. 
But, in the same framework, the new technical advance will in its 
turn produce further secondary and unpredictable effects which are 
no less disastrous than the preceding ones (aithough they will be of 
another kind). De Castro declares that the new techniques of soil 
cultivation presuppose more and more powerful state control, with 
its police power, its ideology, and its propaganda machinery. This 
is the price we must pay.
William Vogt, surveying the same problem, is still more precise: 
in order to avoid famine, resulting from the systematic destruction 
of the topsoil, we must apply the latest technical methods. But con­
servation will not be put into practice spontaneously by individuals; 
yet, these methods must be applied globally or they will not amount 
to anything. Who can do this? Vogt, like all good Americans, asserts 
that he detests the authoritarian police state. However, he agrees 
that only state controls can possibly produce the desired results. He 
extols the efforts made by the liberal administration of the United 
States in this respect, but he agrees that the United States continues 
“to lose ground literally and figuratively,” simply' because the 
methods of American agricultural administration are not authori­
tarian enough.
What measures are to be recommended? The various soils must 
be classified as to possible ways to cultivate them without destroy­
ing them. Authoritarian methods must be applied in order (a) to 
evacuate the population and to prevent it from working the im­
periled soil; and (b) to grow only certain products on certain types
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE108)
of soil. The peasant can no longer be allowed freedom in these 
respects. This evolution is to be facilitated by centralization of the 
great land holdings. In Latin America there are today from 20 to 40 
million ecologically displaced persons, persons occupying lands 
which ought not to be under cultivation.They are living on hillsides 
from which it is absolutely necessary to drive them if the means of 
existence of their countries are to be saved from destruction. It will 
be difficult and costly to relocate these people, but Latin America 
has no choice. If she does not solve this problem, she will be re­
duced to the most miserable standard of living.
All experts on agricultural questions are in fact in fundamental 
agreement. De Castro (although hostile to the ideas of Vogt) and 
Dumont (critical of de Castro on certain points) come to the con­
clusion that only strict planning on a world scale can solve the prob­
lems of agriculture, and that only human relocation and collective 
distribution of wealth can solve the problem of famine. This can 
only mean that man, if he is to improve the traditional agricultural 
techniques and be rid of their drawbacks, will be obliged to apply 
extremely rigorous administrative and police techniques. Here again 
we have a good example of the interconnection of different elements 
and of the unpredictability of the secondary effects.
It was believed for a long time that the TVA was a praiseworthy 
response to certain problems raised by technique. Today, however, 
certain major flaws have become apparent. For example, the correct 
application of methods of reforestation and animal reproduction 
were not understood. Flood control was not carried out by retention 
of the water in the soil but by submerging permanently a good part 
of the lands which have been saved to protect others. Man, we 
repeat, is never able to foresee the totality of effects of his tech­
nique. No one could have foreseen that regulating the Colorado 
River for irrigation purposes would lead the Pacific Ocean to en­
croach upon the coast of California, or that it would endanger 
the valleys (which had been “regulated”) by the removal of up to 
500 tons a day of sand and rock. It is likewise impossible to foresee 
the effect of techniques intended to control the weather, dispel 
clouds, precipitate rain or snow, and so on. In another area, 
Professor Lemaire, in a study of narcotic drugs, shows that tech­
nique permits the manufacture of synthetic narcotics with greater 
and greater ease and in increasing quantities. But, according to
The Technological Society (109
Lemaire, the control of these drugs is thereby rendered more and 
more difficult because “we cannot predict whether they will or 
will not be dangerous. The only proof is their habitual use by 
addicts. But to obtain this proof requires y ears of experience.*
There is scarcely need to recall that universal famine, the most 
serious danger known to humanity,* is caused by the advance of 
certain medical techniques which have brought with them good and 
evil inextricably mixed. This is not a question of good or bad use. 
No more so is the problem, posed by atomic techniques, of the dis­
posal of atomic waste. Atomic explosions are not the real problem. 
The real problem continues to be that of the disposal of the 
ceaselessly accumulating waste materials, despite the reassuring 
but unfortunately partisan explanations of some atomic scientists. 
The International Agency for Atomic Energy recognized, in 1959, 
that these wastes represent a deadly peril and that there is no sure 
way of avoiding it, except perhaps by means of the difficult process 
of "vitrification” being undertaken in Canada. And all this involves 
the peaceful use of the atom!
In every case, what can really be foreseen more or less clearly is 
the need of state intervention to control the effects of technical 
applications. But by the time a technique is modified in the light 
of these effects, the evil has already been done. When it is proposed 
to “choose* between effects, it is always too late. It is doubtless still 
possible to modify any given element, but only at the price 0i 
secondary repercussions. Again, it is doubtless possible to produce, 
by means of rational exploitation of natural resources, enough food 
to nourish five billion human beings. But this can be accomplished 
only at the price of forced labor and a new kind of slavery. What­
ever point we choose to examine, we always perceive this inter­
relation of techniques. In i960, the World Congress for the Study of 
Nutrition considered the problem of how modem nutrition is viti­
ated by the use of chemical products which are themselves sig­
nificant contributory causes of the so-called diseases of civilization 
(cancer, cardiovascular illnesses, etc.). But the Congress’s studies 
indicate that the solution can no longer be a return to a “natural* 
nutrition. On the contrary, a further step must be taken which 
involves completely artificial alimentation, so-called rational ali-

THE CHARACTEROLOCY OP TECHNIQUE1 1 0 )
mentation. It will not be sufficient merely to control grains, meat, 
butter, and so forth. The stage at which this would have been 
feasible has been passed. New technical methods must be found. 
But can we be assured that this new alimentation will in its turn 
present no danger?
Every rejection of a technique judged to be bad entails the appli­
cation of a new technique, the value of which is estimated from the 
point of view of efficiency alone. But we are always unaware of the 
more remote repercussions. History shows us that these are seldom 
positive, at least when we consider history as a whole instead of 
contenting ourselves with examining disconnected phenomena such 
as the population increase, the prolongation of the average life 
span, or the shortening of the work week. These are symptoms 
which perhaps would have meaning if man were merely an animal, 
but which have no conclusive significance if man is something more 
than a production machine.
However, it is not my intention to show that technique will end in 
disaster. On the contrary, technique has only one principle: efficient 
ordering. Everything, for technique, is centered on the concept of 
order. This explains the development of moral and political doc­
trines at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Everything which 
represented an ordering principle was taken in deadly earnest. At 
the same time the means destined to elaborate this order were 
exploited as never before. Order and peace were required for the 
development of the individual techniques (after society had 
reached the necessary stage of disintegration). Peace is indispensa­
ble to the triumph of industrialization. It will be hastily concluded 
from this that industrialization will promote peace. But, as always, 
logical deductions falsify reality. J. U. Nef has shown admirably 
that industrialization cannot act otherwise than to promote wars. 
This is no accident, but rather an organic relation. It holds not only 
because of the direct influence of industrialization on the means of 
destruction but also because of its influence on the means of ex­
istence. Technical progress favors war, according to Nef, because 
(a) the new weapons have rendered more difficult the distinction 
between offense and defense; and (b) they have enormously re­
duced the pain and anguish implied in the act of killing.
On another plane, the distinction between peaceful industry and 
military industry is no longer possible. Every industry, every tech-
The Technological Society (111
nique, however humane its intentions, has military value. "The 
humanitarian scientist finds himself confronted by a new dilemma: 
Must he look for ways to make people live longer so that they are 
better able to destroy one another?” Nef has described all this 
remarkably well It is no longer a question of simple human be­
havior, but of technical necessity.
The technical phenomenon canncft be broken down in such a 
way as to retain the good and reject the bad. It has a “mass” which 
renders it monistic. To show this we have taken only the simplest, 
and hence the most easily debatable, examples. To enable the 
reader to grasp fully the reality of this monism, it would be neces­
sary to present every problem with all its implications and ramifi­
cations into other fields. The case of the police, for example, cannot 
be considred merely within its specific confines; police technique 
is closely connected with the techniques of propaganda, adminis­
tration, and even economics. Economics demands, in effect, an 
increasing productivity; it is impossible to accept the nonproducers 
into the body social— the loafers, the coupon-clippers, the social 
misfits, and the saboteurs— none of these have any place. The police 
must develop methods to put these useless consumers to work. The 
problem is the same in a capitalist state (where the Communist is 
the saboteur) and in a Communist state (where the saboteur is the 
internationalist in the pay of capitalism).
The necessities and the modes of action of all these techniques 
combine to form a whole, each part supporting and reinforcing the 
others. They constitute a co-ordinated phenomenon, no element of 
which can be detached from the others. It is an illusion, a perfectly 
understandable one, to hope to be able to suppress the “bad” side 
of technique and preserve the “good.” This belief means that the 
essence of the technical phenomenon has not been grasped.
The Necessary Linking Together of Techniques. We have seen 
how the two technical characteristics, self-augmentation and 
monism, combine. Now we must consider the historical, necessary 
linking up of all the different techniques. This analysis will complete 
my discussion of these two characteristics.
Machine technique appeared after 1750. The technical state of 
mind was first manifested in the application of the principles of 
science. We already know how this necessity arose (it is emphasized 
in all textbooks). The flying shuttle of 1733 made a greater pro-
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE1 1 1 )
duction of yarn necessary. But production was impossible without 
a suitable machine. The response to this dilemma was the invention 
of the spinning jenny by James Hargreaves. But then yarn was 
product*! in much greater quantities than could possibly be used 
by the weavers. To solve this new problem, Cartwright manu­
factured his celebrated loom. In this series of events we see in its 
simplest form the interaction that accelerates the development of 
machines. Each new machine disturbs the equilibrium of pro­
duction; the restoration of equilibrium entails the creation of one 
or more additional machines in other areas of operation.
Production becomes more and more complex. The combination 
of machines within the same enterprise, is a notable characteristic of 
the nineteenth century. It is impossible, in effect, to have an isolated 
machine. There must be adjunct machines, if not preparatory ones. 
This need, which is not clearly evident in the textile industry (a 
loom is relatively self-sufficient), is singularly well defined in the 
metallurgical industry. Fabrication in this area consists of multiple 
inseparable operations. For each of these operations, one or more 
machines are needed. This gives rise to a complex enterprise which 
demands the application of the organization of production. The 
need for organization of machines is found even in the textile 
industry. A large number of looms must be grouped together in 
order to utilize the prime mover most effectively, since no indi­
vidual loom consumes very much energy. To obtain maximum yield, 
machines cannot be disposed in a haphazard way. Nor can produc­
tion take place irregularly. A plan must be followed in all technical 
domains. And this plan, which becomes more and more inflexible in 
proportion to increasing production, is the product of a technique 
of organization and of operation.
Organizational technique was still very sketchy at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century. But with the increase in the number of 
manufactured products, new commercial methods had to be 
created. Capital, labor, producers, and consumers had to be found. 
Three new kinds of technique emerged: commercial, industrial, 
and transportational. Commercial techniques developed at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century with the same velocity as 
industrial techniques. These commercial techniques exploited all 
the old systems which had previously existed sporadically and
The Technological Society (113
without much vigor. Bills of exchange, banks, clearing houses, 
double-entry bookkeeping, and the like, were further developed.
The need to distribute manufactured goods thus acted to produce 
a powerful commercial technique, which, however, proved to be 
incapable of assuring proper distribution. The accumulation of 
capital (produced by the machine and also necessitated by it) be­
came tlie source of an international financial organization, with 
its systems of great firms, insurance, credit, and the corporation 
with limited liabilities. The corporation was indispensable in view 
of die magnitude of the commercial traffic generated by sheer 
concentration.
But the two systems, commercial and financial, were only able 
to function at full capacity if they were in a position to dispose of 
their merchandise at the most favorable point, as determined by 
commercial techniques. This implied the rapid, regular, and certain 
transport of merchandise. Hence, systems of transport had to be 
assured if financial and commercial techniques were to be able to 
operate. A new technique came into being, transport, which was 
not a direct result of the machine. It was a separate branch; and 
organization played a greater role in it than the machine itself (in 
railway routes and timetables, problems of eminent domain, etc.).
At the period this technical torrent was emerging from industrial 
enterprise, a crowd of human beings began to gather about the 
machine. A great number of individuals were necessary to service 
it; an equally great number were required to collect about it to com- 
sume its products. The first great change consisted in forcing the 
consumer to come to the machine, inasmuch as adequate means of 
transportation were to come fifty years too late. With this develop­
ment came the hitherto unknown phenomenon of the big city. 
At the beginning, the big city engendered no particular technique; 
people were merely unhappy in it But it soon appeared that mega­
lopolis represented a new and special kind of environment, calling 
for special treatment. The technique of city planning made its ap­
pearance. At first, urban planning was only a clumsy kind of adap­
tation which was little concerned, for example, with slums (despite 
the efforts of the utopian planners of the middle of the century). 
Somewhat later, as big city life became for the most part intolera­
ble, techniques of amusement were developed. It became indis­
THE CHARACTEHOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE
pensable to make urban suffering acceptable by furnishing amuse­
ments, a necessity which was to assure the rise, for example, of a 
monstrous motion-picture industry.
This phase of development was still dominated by the machine, 
and corresponded to what Mumford has called the paleotechnical 
period. During this period the instruments of the power mentality 
developed. It became apparent that mechanical improvements 
alone do not suffice to yield socially valuable results. This was 
clearly a period of transition in which inventions had not yet com­
pletely overthrown the older institutions. And they had not yet 
touched human life, except indirectly. It was a period of disorder. 
And the most glaring manifestation of this disorder was man’s ex­
ploitation of man. This disorder, however, led to a strenuous search 
for order, which developed first in the economic field. For some 
time it had been possible to believe that the increasing flow of 
merchandise would be absorbed automatically. But the illusions 
of liberalism collapsed very quickly. Little by little, the liberal 
system broke down before the profusion of goods which the ma­
chine blindly poured forth. It was inescapable that only technical 
methods of distribution would be able to cope with the problems 
created by technical methods of production. There was no way 
around it. A mechanism of distribution and consumption was nec­
essary, as precise as the mechanism of production, which itself was 
not yet sufficiently precise, merely because it was mechanical. It 
was imperative that the different parts of the productive mecha­
nism be adjusted and that the goods produced correspond exactly 
to the need, in quantity as well as in quality. It was no-longer suffi­
cient to organize enterprise. The entire production had to be 
organized in all its details. And if production were completely or­
ganized, there could be no question of allowing consumption 
(which had, in the meantime, become mechanized) to operate 
without its own world-wide organization. These logical interac­
tions, which emerged first on the national level, were soon found 
on the international level as well.
The development of this mechanism inevitably implied the most 
perfect possible economic technique. This economic technique in 
turn would permit the utilization of new machines. Reciprocally, 
certain other instruments would facilitate the improvement of the 
economic technique. Moreover, nothing could be left to chance,
The Technological Society ( 115
in this kind of organization; the labor supply in particular could not 
be entrusted to the whim of the individual. Economic organization 
presupposes a technique of labor. ( The precise form of this tech­
nique is of little consequence to us here. We are interested only in 
the principle.) Labor had to be systematized; it had to become 
scientific. Thus, of necessity a new technique was added to the pre­
ceding ones. But at the same time it became mandatory to com­
pensate the workers for the fatigue generated by technical labor. 
Here we meet again the necessity for additional mass amusement 
— a necessity which the existence of the big city had already pro­
voked. The cycle was inevitable.
The whole edifice was constructed little by little, and all its indi­
vidual techniques were improved by mutual interaction. Before 
long, however, the need for still another instrument appeared. Who 
was to co-ordinate this multiplicity of techniques? Who was to 
build the mechanism necessary to the new economic technique? 
Who was to make binding the decisions necessary to service the 
machines? The individual is not by himself rational enough to ac­
cept what is necessary to the machines. He rebels too easily. He 
requires an agency to constrain him, and the state had to play this 
role— but the state now could not be the incoherent, powerless, and 
arbitrary state of tradition. It had to be an effective state, equal to 
the functioning of the economic regime and in control of every­
thing, to the end that machines which had developed at random 
should become “coherent.” To this end, the state itself must be 
coherent. Thus, the techniques of the state— military, police, ad­
ministrative, and political— made their appearance. Without them, 
all the rest would have been no more than faint hopes unable to at­
tain maximum development. They intermingled, necessitating one 
another, and all of them necessitated by the economy.
It soon became evident that such external action was insufficient. 
A  great effort was required of the individual, and this effort he 
could not make unless he was genuinely convinced, not merely 
constrained. He must be made to yield his heart and will, as he had 
yielded his body and brain. And so the techniques of propaganda, 
education, and psychic manipulation came to reinforce the others. 
Without them, man could scarcely have been equal to his organiza­
tions and his machines. Without them, technique could not have 
been completely certain of its operation. To the degree that material
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUEll6)
techniques became more precise, intellectual and psychic tech­
niques became more necessary. By these means man acquired the 
conviction and strength needed to make possible the maximum 
utilization of the others. So the edifice was completed.
It is impossible to amputate a part of the system or to modify it 
in any way without modifying the whole. The system was not built 
through whim or personal ambition. Its factors were all reciprocally 
engendered.
In this description we have constantly encountered the term 
necessity; it is necessity which characterizes the technical uni­
verse. Everything must accommodate itself to it with mathematical 
certainty. Every successive technique has appeared because the 
ones which preceded it rendered necessary the ones which fol­
lowed. Otherwise they would have been inefficacious and would 
not have been able to deliver their maximum yield.
It is useless to hope for modification of a system like this— so com­
plex and precisely adjusted that no single part can be modified by 
itself. Moreover, the system perfects and completes itself unremit­
tingly. And, except in print, I see no sign of any modification of the 
technical edifice, no principle of a different social organization that 
would not be founded on technical necessity.
Technical Unioersalism. This characteristic of the technical phe­
nomenon manifests itself under two aspects, the first geographic 
and the second qualitative.
From the geographic point of view, it is easy to see that tech­
nique is constantly gaining ground, country by country, and that 
its area of action is the whole world. In all countries, whatever 
their degree of “civilization,’*  there is a tendency to apply the same 
technical procedures. Even when the population of a given country 
is not completely assimilated technically, it is nevertheless able to 
use the instruments which technique puts into its hands. The peo­
ple of these countries have no need to be Westernized. Technique, 
to be used, does not require a “civilized” man. Technique, what­
ever hand uses it, produces its effect more or less totally in propor­
tion to the individual’s more or less total absorption in it.
Vogt emphasizes this fact, for example, when he shows that in 
the domain of agriculture the most up-to-date techniques have be­
come universal. Never before, says Vogt, has man destroyed his 
natural environment “with the inexorableness of an armored divi-
The Technological Society (117
sion. These ‘civilized’ forces of destruction, which have been de­
veloped under our influence, have conquered the entire globe to 
such a degree that Malays, Hottentots and Ainos are spreading the 
plague.”
In the course of history there have always been different princi­
ples of civilization according to regions, nations, and continents. 
But today everything tends to align itself on technical principles. 
In the past, different civilizations took different “paths”; today all 
peoples follow the same road and the same impulse. This does not 
mean that they have all reached the same point, but they are situ­
ated at different points along the same trajectory. The United 
States represents the type that France will represent in thirty years, 
and China in possibly eighty. All the business of life, from work 
and amusement to love and death, is seen from the technical point 
of view. The number of “technical slaves” is growing rapidly, and 
the ideal of all governments is to push as fast as possible toward 
industrialization and technical enslavement.
I am well acquainted with the perfectly valid arguments which 
turn on economic necessity and the misery of the so-called “back­
ward” peoples. But the problem is not the process involved; it is 
simply to note that different societies are adopting Western tech­
nique. The Vevey Congress of i960 forcefully emphasized this 
point. Although, understandably, the primary problem of the un­
derdeveloped peoples is undernourishment, obsession with tech­
nique has befuddled them to such a point that what they are de­
manding, and what we are offering, is the very industrialization 
that will aggravate the evil. Technique is the same in all latitudes 
and hence acts to make different civilizations uniform. This tend­
ency arises directly from technique itself. The Oriental, Russian, 
and South American societies were by no means historically pre­
pared, as was ours, to favor technical development
The best sociologists have noted that technique involves die 
same effects everywhere. R. P. Lynton writes: “The industrializa­
tion of a community of Europe or America, on the one hand; or of 
Siam, Nigeria, Turkey, or Uruguay, on the other, poses the same 
problems.” If the technical movement had had its inception in one 
of these “backward” countries, it would have aborted. But these 
societies are presented with a technical movement in full vigor and 
in all its expansive power. No longer is there any question as to
THE CHAtUCTEnOLOCY OF TECHNIQUE118)
whether circumstances favorable to its flowering exist. The tech­
nical movement is strong enough to impose itself and to break down 
all barriers to its progress.
But why does this expansion exist at all? Until now it was gen­
erally accepted that very similar social environments were neces­
sary if propagation of techniques were to occur. This is no longer 
true. Today technique imposes itself, whatever the environment. 
This expansive force can be explained by a whole ensemble of 
historical reasons (more or less superficial, though true), and by 
one profound reason ( to be examined later on).
The historical reasons are bound up with two great currents 
which have occasioned the technical invasion:  commerce and war. 
Colonial war opened the door to those European nations that 
possessed the whole complex of technical means. The conquering 
nations exported their machines and their organization through 
their armies. The vanquished peoples, in a state of mind com­
pounded of admiration and fear, adopted the machines, which 
came to replace their gods. Not only were the machines the means 
their conquerors had used to subdue them, but the machines repre­
sented the possible means for liberation from these conquerors. In 
these colonies traffic in arms and in all the instruments of power 
began to flourish as a means of provoking insurrection. At first, 
rebellion was incoherent, but to the degree that these peoples be­
came better organized and technicized, rebellion became a national 
affair.
War also involved the backward peoples globally. I have in 
mind not so much the direct effects of colonial war as the effects of 
wars among so-called civilized nations. The colonies of Germany 
and France became involved in the war between these nations. 
Later on, China and Siberia came in. Yakuts rode in tanks in the 
front line of the Red Army. War provokes the sudden and stupefy­
ing adaptation of the “savage” to machinery and discipline.
The second factor governing technical invasion is commerce. It 
was mandatory for the Western powers to conquer the markets 
necessary for Western industry and technical life. No barrier could 
oppose this necessity; and primitive peoples were literally 
swamped by the products of modem technique. In 1945 the Ameri­
cans sent tons of individual military rations to the Bulgarians, who 
had no desire at all to adapt themselves to a new kind of butter and
The Technological Society (119
to other substitutes. But their resistance necessarily yielded to tech­
nical adaptation and, very rapidly, to plain abundance. The exces­
siveness of the means broke down all traditional and individual 
desires.
After consumer goods came an invasion of productive tech­
niques. Technical invasion is a question not only of colonialism but 
also, for the less powerful countries, of simple technical subordina­
tion. This, and this only, explains the formation of the two blocs 
today. All political or economic explanations are superficial and 
ridiculous. There are two great technical powers, the United States 
and the Soviet Union. Every other country must subordinate itself 
to one or the other of the two simply because of their technical 
superiority. Technical invasion is not exclusively colonial in­
vasion but assumes other forms as well.
The phenomenon of present-day decolonialization is closely re­
lated to the possibilities of the technical development of peoples 
who, up to now, have lived in symbiosis with colonial powers. From 
the very moment of "independence,” these peoples are constrained 
to appeal for assistance to the two major powers; after all, they can­
not possibly be self-sufficient on the technical plane. The major 
powers then equip them in a “disinterested” way. In fact, of course, 
the major powers have no choice if they cherish any hope at all that 
the poverty of these new “free” nations will not make them theatres 
of endemic war (not to mention the fact that the major powers are 
themselves in competition). Thus, the best and most moral inten­
tions (as, for example, Harry S. Truman’s Point Four aid to colonial 
lands) lead to a rapid technicization of the world; and every polit­
ical phenomenon accelerates this technicization, which necessarily 
assumes a Western look.
The expensive factors are clearly favored by the elementary 
technical facts. Consider, for example, the speed and thoroughness 
of the means of communication, which permit technical products 
to be transported anywhere in the world soon after their appear­
ance in the country of origin. The result of this must be speedy 
unification.
The very means of communication presuppose such unification. 
Great ocean-going vessels necessitate continually improved port 
installations everywhere. Railroads demand identical roadbeds in 
all countries. Aviation requires a whole technical substructure.
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE130 )
which is becoming more important day by day and which must be­
come ever more uniform as tonnage and speed increase.
The creation of the port of Lavera, near Port-de-Bouc, is a case 
in point. To construct a harbor for oil tankers to meet the de­
mands of the French market, it was necessary to conform exactly 
to the international requirements of petroleum shipping. These de­
mands are wholly technical: depth of channel for modem tank­
ers of more than 30,000 tons, special docks, relay reservoirs fitted 
with technical improvements exactly adapted to the tankers, and 
so on. It was clearly impossible to continue to do without these 
facilities. In French home ports today, the petroleum brought in 
by the large tankers must first be discharged by small lighters to 
plants which are either floating installations or of insufficient pump­
ing capacity. This results in loss of time and excessive handling. 
Every ton of crude oil bears an extra burden of approximately 
three dollars. These factors are clear and are leading to the accept­
ance of the most modem procedures— which reciprocally contrib­
utes to world-wide technical unification.
There is still another element in the mechanism of technical 
expansion: the export of technicians. This is not only a question of 
German technicians going, for example, to the United States or to 
Russia. (This exodus, incidentally, was accompanied by a certain 
technical flowering which rendered German technique truly in­
ternational.) There is the same diffusion of American technique to 
underdeveloped countries by the application of President Truman's 
Point Four Program. Academicians are supplied who are charged 
with blueprinting the future of underdeveloped peoples. (This 
form of technical assistance assimilates intellectually the inhabi­
tants of the countries in question.) In addition, the United States 
directly supplies the necessary technicians for exploiting the natu­
ral resources of these countries. The immediate purpose is to raise 
the standard of living of the population, beginning with a realistic 
appraisal of the possibilities of the given country, and the final ob­
jective is a perfectly humanitarian one; we can refrain from passing 
judgment on whether American imperialism is involved. Neverthe­
less, this leads to a diffusion of techniques throughout the world in 
an accelerated tempo, and at the same time it leads to technical 
identity in all countries.
A certain educational unity is also involved here. Every citizen
The Technological Society (121
of an underdeveloped country must become adept in the use of 
the new techniques. This leads to the extension of European-style 
education, allows the colored peoples to participate actively in 
scientific progress, and provokes as a consequence a kind of a 
priori adhesion to technical diffusion. Since 1956 we have been 
witnessing the same diffusion of technicians from the Soviet Union, 
and more recently from China, to Syria, Guinea, Ghana, and Cuba. 
Without entertaining political suspicions of these acts, let us bear 
in mind only that these factors, among others, are an active aid to 
technical invasion.
Technical invasion does not involve the simple addition of new 
values to old ones. It does not put new wine into old bottles; it 
does not introduce new content into old forms. The old bottles are 
all being broken. The old civilizations collapse on contact with the 
new. And the same phenomenon appears under every possible cul­
tural form. Take, for example, religion. We have seen one religion 
disappear under our very eyes as a result of a technical fact: Mi­
kado worship vanished after the bomb was dropped at Hiroshima. 
We are witnessing the collapse of Buddhism under Communist 
pressure in Tibet and China. And, according to recent studies. 
Buddhism is vanishing for technical reasons, not because of the 
ideological effect of Communism. The phenomenon is due, on the 
one hand, to a brutal and massive infusion of industrial techniques 
and, on the other, to the use of propaganda techniques which en­
tail the abandonment of religion by the ever growing population. 
In a certain sense these religious people are not left without reli­
gion. To their transcendental religion a “social” religion is opposed, 
a religion which is but an expression of technical progress.
Even the most classically oriented sociologists today recognize 
that the impact of techniques is producing a collapse of the non- 
Westem civilizations. This involves the collapse of cultural as well 
as of economic forms, and of the traditional psychological and 
sociological structures.
UNESCO has been greatly preoccupied with these questions, 
and both the Bulletin of the Social Sciences and the reports of Dr. 
Margaret Mead strike an alarming note. Investigators find, in effect, 
that it is easy to transfer technical procedures, but that the elabora­
tion of sociological and psychological methods of controlling them 
is slow, difficult, and laborious.
1 2  2 )  THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE
One is always running up against the simple-minded tendency 
to say, as Charles F. Frankel puts it, that "it is sufficient to give 
technical procedures and their accumulated blessings to the back­
ward peoples in order to put them on their feet, as one might give 
an injection to a sick man.” This kind of injection may conceivably 
help. But in giving it, we destroy the traditional ways of life. Tech­
nique does not, of itself, carry its own equilibrium. The opposite is 
nearer the truth. We have seen in the West how technique des­
troyed communities and brought the relevance of the human being 
into question, even though technique was born in the Western 
milieu and grew only slowly. How much more formidable are its 
effects when it is suddenly implanted in a foreign environment, ap­
pearing in all its power at a single stroke. In Africa the worker is 
separated from his family and, as S. Herbert Frankel says, “his 
social ego remains attached to the rural group while he himself has 
been transplanted into an industrial milieu. When his family comes 
to the city they are completely unprepared for urban life and are 
destroyed in that environment morally and sociologically.” In 
Australia we find the same collapse of the traditional way of life. 
A. P. Elkin says: “In the tribe, authority belonged to the eld­
ers . . . but it is now in process of passing to the corral boss, 
or to the ranch owner. . . . The mysterious rites, which are asso­
ciated with the succession of the seasons and with the search for 
food, and which in the past occupied a great deal of time, are tend­
ing to lose their meaning.” It would be easy enough to give many 
more examples.
Every culture must be considered as a whole. The transformation 
of a given element through the effect of technique produces shocks 
in all areas. All the peoples of the world today live in a cultural 
breakdown provoked by the conflicts and the internal strife re­
sulting from technique. Over and above this— as Margaret Mead 
points out— since every human being incorporates in his own per­
son the cultural environment in which he lives, its disagreements 
and incoherences are to be met with again in each individual 
personality.
Moreover, we are poorly equipped to respond to this cultural 
collapse. We have few studies of the mentality and the needs of 
these peoples, and even fewer studies of their psychological reac­
tions to technique. We have no studies of the social and adminis-
The Technological Society (123
trative measures that might meet their needs, or of their changes 
in aptitudes. We never send along with our technique any civilized 
environment or adaptable value capable of replacing what is being 
destroyed. This, at any rate, is the diagnosis of UNESCO, an 
agency generally characterized by optimism.
The situation is being studied now, but for the most part we are 
too late. All the instruments ought long since to have been pre­
pared, for no natural adaptation or spontaneous reorganization can 
be counted upon. No hope of this exists. We have no instruments 
ready. And while the problem is being studied, the ravages of 
technique are making steady inroads. We are in a veritable race, 
but it is evident that we are beaten before we begin. The effects of 
technique are already too far advanced for us to begin again at 
the beginning. There is no doubt that all the traditional cultures 
and sociological structures will be destroyed by technique before 
we can discover or invent social, economic, and psychological 
forms of adaptation which might possibly have preserved the 
equilibrium of these peoples and societies.
In the political sphere the phenomenon takes the form of the 
brutal transition from elementary forms of society to the fully 
developed modem dictatorship. A major part of the world’s popu­
lation has passed in a few years from serfdom or feudalism to the 
most punctilious dictatorial state, by virtue and necessity of pro­
ductive and administrative techniques. The Soviet Union, Turkey, 
and Japan are well-known examples.
The problem of dictatorship is likewise posed by decolonializa- 
tion. Either one succeeds in organizing the country and in estab­
lishing a centralized authoritarian state (as has occurred in 
Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Sudan) or anarchy reigns (as in the 
Belgian Congo, CameroonJ. Halfway liberal successes (as, for 
example, Tunisia) are infinitely rare and fragile.
As to economics, it seems scarcely necessary to discuss these 
problems. All the traditional economic structures of production and 
distribution in Africa and Asia are exploding in the presence of the 
new technical means. Up to the time of Western intervention, life 
on the Asiatic continent was highly stable; populations and envi­
ronments were in equilibrium. O f course, things were far from be­
ing perfect; undernourishment, for example, was always a danger. 
But certain civilizations were harmonious enough; some of them
TH E CHARACTEROLOCT O F TECHNIQUE1 * 4 )
endured much longer than our own. Everyone, I believe, agrees 
that the tribulations of modem Asia stem in part from the com­
plexity that the West has imposed on it, the complexity and density 
of structure provoked by the indispensable application of tech­
niques.
In all areas, then, technique is producing the rapid collapse of 
all other civilizations. When we speak of the collapse of these civili­
zations, we are speaking only of sociological forms. Even the weak­
est civilizations preserve certain values which, in Roger Bastide’s 
words, permit them to "maintain a mental equilibrium which cul­
tural shock might shatter. . . . The social situation allows the old 
complexes to remain alive which, not being fulfilled any longer 
through ancestral customs, create for themselves new defense 
mechanisms." But it is very probable that this situation is only 
temporary; even these psychological- reserves will be attacked and 
absorbed by technique when the so-called human techniques 
(those which have man for their object) are applied to them.
Obviously, the effect of technique on these groups will not he 
the same everywhere. Detailed sociological studies have been 
made of the various phenomena of assimilation, regrouping, func­
tioning, and marasmus or progressive dissolution. According to 
these studies, there has not been comparable and identical pro­
gression in every case. However, behind this diversity is to be 
noted an absolute incompatibility between the technical type of 
civilization and all the others. Technicians have not willed this 
outcome; no one seeks consciously to destroy a civilization. This 
is simply the proverbial collision between the earthenware pot and 
the iron pot. What happens, happens, despite the best possible 
intentions of the iron pot.
It might be said: "This is not necessary. Why should the simple 
fact of bringing more well-being to India ruin the Hindu civiliza­
tion?” I do not know if it is necessary, but nevertheless it is so. A 
civilization which is collapsing cannot be re-created abstractly. 
It is too late to turn back and enable these worlds to live. What 
has been given them is not simply well-being. This well-being pre­
supposes a transformation of all of life: work where there had been 
only laziness; machines and their accessories, organs of co-ordina­
tion and rational administration, and internal adherence to the 
regime.
The Technological Society ( u j
Technique cannot be otherwise than totalitarian. It can be truly 
efficient and scientific only if it absorbs an enormous number of 
phenomena and brings into play the maximum of data. In order to 
co-ordinate and exploit synthetically, technique must be brought to 
bear on the great masses in every area. But the existence of tech­
nique in every area leads to monopoly. This is noted by Jacques 
Driencourt when he declares that the technique of propaganda is 
totalitarian by its very nature. It is totalitarian in message, meth­
ods, field of action, and means. What more could be required?
One could require more. Totalitarianism extends to whatevei 
touches it, even things which seem, at first sight, very remote from 
it. When technique has fastened upon a method, everything must 
be subordinated to it. There are no longer any neutral objects or 
situations. Claude Munson forcefully demonstrates that psychologi­
cal technique, as it operates in the army or in a great industrial 
plant, entails a direct action on the family. It involves psycholog­
ical adaptation of family life to military or industrial methods, 
supervision of family life, and training family life for military or 
industrial service. Technique can leave nothing untouched in a 
civilization. Everything is its concern.
It will be objected: "If these transformations do take place, tech­
nique alone is not responsible. Many other factors have contrib­
uted; for example, the intellectual superiority of the white race, the 
corruption of these other civilizations, and the population growth.”  
In fact, all these factors refer back to the problems of techniques. 
Indeed, Western intellectual superiority is only manifested in the 
technical domain. And the alleged corruption of the Chinese and 
Islamic civilizations depends solely on the criteria by which they 
are judged. In making the objection, we are in effect judging solely 
on the basis of technical criteria.
Again, it will be objected: “Granting all this, is it not the case 
that coexistence, and even synthesis, has been possible between 
these two kinds of life? After all, when the Barbarians invaded the 
Roman Empire, a successful synthesis eventually took place.” But 
the historical situation was clearly not the same then as it is to­
day. In fact, it was the Roman civilization which, being technical, 
endured. The civilizations threatened today by our own can offer 
no effective resistance because they are nontechnical.
The decisive factor which leads me to reject the three objections
THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE1 *6  )
just stated is that our technique, which is destroying aO other civili­
zations, is more than a simple mechanism: it is a whole civilization 
in itself.
We have analyzed the combination of circumstances that 
favored technical development in the West and guaranteed its 
easy diffusion. Since technique has engulfed civilization, a very 
remarkable effect has been observed— in fact, a complete reversal. 
When technique penetrates a new milieu, it tends to reproduce in 
this milieu the circumstances which, in a fortuitous way, it found 
favorable to itself in the nineteenth century in France and Eng­
land. At least, it reproduces those features which it is possible and 
necessary to reproduce. It is of small importance for technique to 
hit upon a long cultural experience or a favorable demographic 
situation. On the contrary, social plasticity and a clear technical 
consciousness are the general terms which it forcibly imposes in 
every area of the world. It dissociates the sociological forms, des­
troys the moral framework, desacralizes men and things, explodes 
social and religious taboos, and reduces the body social to a collec­
tion of individuals. The most recent sociological studies (even 
those made by optimists) hold that technique is the destroyer of 
social groups, of communities (whatever their kind), and of 
human relations. Technical progress causes the disappearance, as 
Jerome Scott and R. P. Lynton put it, of that “amalgam of attitudes, 
customs and social institutions which constitute a community.” 
Communities break up into their component parts But no new 
communities form. The individual in contact with technique loses 
his social and community sense as the frameworks in which he op­
erated disintegrate under the influence of techniques. This fact is 
established beyond question by the disappearance hf responsibili­
ties, functional autonomies, and social spontaneities, the absence of 
contact between the technical and the human environment, and so 
forth. In the area of industrial labor, for example, sociologists point 
out the physical separation between the industrial plant and the 
social group in which the plant is situated (the city, say). In tra­
ditional societies, the social and the economic aspects of life were 
inextricably meshed into a social whole. But in a technical society 
the two aspects are strictly separated; this in itself brings about 
the dissolution of the entire group. Related activities such as pro­
duction and social relations cannot be separated without ruining
The Technological Society ( 127
the whole society. However, to the degree that production is tech­
nique and social relations is not, the two are of necessity dissociated. 
This is the conclusion reached by innumerable detailed studies of 
social groups at the point at which technique begins to function. 
The conclusion is equally true of the industrialized milieus of Eu­
rope, America, Asia, and Africa. The situation cannot be otherwise. 
The technicians themselves are very clear on this point. For exam­
ple, an official report of 1958 on the perspectives of economic devel­
opment in Algeria indicated that this development can only be 
brought about by changing the Algerians’ whole way of life, in 
particular, by putting the still seminomad masses to work. Develop­
ment involves economic planning, displacement of populations, 
mobilization of the local economy, acceptance of authoritarian po­
litical power, modification of local moral habits and traditional 
mentalities; in short, a New Deal of the Emotions! These are the 
conditions proposed and (and considered normal) for technical 
progress in the ’Third World.”*  Technique makes its sociological 
compost pile where it does not find one already made. And it pos­
sesses sufficient power and efficiency today to succeed. Before long, 
it will produce everywhere that clear technical consciousness which 
is the easiest of its creations to bring about, and which man falls in 
with so willingly. The world that technique creates cannot be any 
other than that which was favorable to it from the very beginning. 
In spite of all the men of good will, all the optimists, all the doers 
of history, the civilizations of the world are being ringed about 
with a band of steel. We in the West became familiar with this 
iron constraint in the nineteenth century. Now technique is me­
chanically reproducing it everywhere as necessary to its existence. 
What force could prevent technique from so acting, or make it be 
otherwise than it is?
Technique has progressively mastered all the elements of civiliza­
tion. We have already pointed this out with regard to man’s eco­
nomic and intellectual activities. But man himself is overpowered 
by technique and becomes its object. The technique which takes 
man for its object thus becomes the center of society; this extraordi­
nary event (which seems to surprise no one) is often designated 
as technical civilization. The terminology is exact and we must fully
* Sauvy, Balaodier, et at.: Le Tiers Monde.
1x8) th e ch aracteh olocy o f tech n iq ue
grasp its importance. Technical civilization means that our civili­
zation is constructed by technique ( makes a part of civilization only 
what belongs to technique), for technique (in that everything in 
this civilization must serve a technical end), and is exclusively 
technique (in that it excludes whatever is not technique or reduces 
it to technical form).
W e can see that this is actually the case in certain phenomena 
considered essential to a civilization, for example, art and litera­
ture. These activities in modern society are tightly subordinated 
in different ways to technical necessities by the direct interference of 
technique. Take, for example, the motion pictures, radio, and tele­
vision. These media require great capital investments. As a result, 
artistic expression is subordinated to a censorship of money or of 
the state. This censorship most often takes the form of indirect in­
fluences, which, again, may assume different guises. Personal music 
is supplanted by the radio; and painting, threatened by photogra­
phy, is obliged to modify itself by becoming abstract so as not to 
be a mere substitute for reproduction. Modern art and literature 
manifest in all points their subordination to the technique which 
has extended its power over all activity, and hence over all culture.
Herein lies the inversion we are witnessing. Without exception in 
die course of history, technique belonged to a civilization and was 
merely a single element among a host of nontechnical activities. 
Today technique has taken over the whole of civilization. Certainly, 
technique is no longer the simple machine substitute for human la­
bor. It has come to be the “intervention into the very substance 
not only of the inorganic but also of the organic.”
This intervention into the inorganic world is represented, for ex­
ample, by the exploration of the atom and its use for purposes as 
yet unknown. But the world which is most clearly taking on a tech­
nical form is the organic. In this realm the necessity of production 
penetrates to the very sources of life. It controls procreation, influ­
ences growth, and alters the individual and the species. Death, 
procreation, birth, habitat; all must submit to technical efficiency 
and systematization, the end point of the industrial assembly line. 
What seems to be most personal in the life of man is now techni- 
cized. The manner in which he rests and relaxes becomes the object 
of techniques of relaxation. The way in which he makes a deci­
sion is no longer the domain of the personal and voluntary; it has
The Technological Society (**9
become the object of the techniques of "operations research.” As 
Giedion says, all this represents experimentation at the very roots 
of being.
How is it possible, then, not to believe that all of civilization is 
affected and engulfed when the very substance of man is ques­
tioned? The essence of civilization is thus absorbed.
Concerning art, Giedion goes on to say: “What happened to art 
in this period gives us the most intimate vision possible of the pene­
tration in depth of the human being by mechanization. Barr’s re­
vealing selections in his Cubism and Abstract Art show us how the 
artist, who reacts like a seismograph, expresses the influence of full 
mechanization . . . Mechanization has penetrated into the sub­
conscious of the artist. Chirico expresses it in a remarkable way in 
the mixture he makes of man and machine . . . The anxiety, the 
solitude of man forms a melancholy architecture of the preced­
ing epoch and its mechanical dolls, painted in the smallest details 
with a tragic expression.”
We have the large-scale frescoes of L6ger which construct the 
image of cities out of signs, traffic signals, and machine parts. Even 
the Russians and Hungarians, who in 1920 were far from mechani­
zation, were inspired by his creative power. In the hands of Du- 
chanu and others, the machine, marvel of efficiency, was trans­
formed into an irrational object, charged with irony. At the same 
time, a new aesthetic language was introduced.
To free themselves from a corrupt art and the prevailing taste, 
artists have recourse to objects such as machines and mechanisms 
because these objects contain an objective truth. What is true of 
the plastic arts is likewise true of music. Preoccupation with “ob­
jectivity” is prevalent there, too. Igor Stravinsky writes: “My work 
is architectonic and not anecdotal; objective construction and not 
descriptive.” These are the words of a man unconsciously steeped 
in the technical milieu. Since Stravinsky wrote this, music has been 
still further transformed by means of techniques which were not 
originally musical techniques, that is, neither musical methodology 
nor instrument construction. I have in mind Schaeffer’s “concrete 
music,” Ussachewsky’s “music for tape,” and Eimert’s electronic 
music, all of which make use of technical means that are not a 
priori musical. In none of these types of music is there any longer 
the need for a performer. The ancestral musical structures disin-
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE1 3 0 )
tegrate and are atomized and we have a phenomenon that is funda­
mentally new. We shall doubtless see ever more refined and ex­
acting research into musical technique, and the dominant 
musical structure and rhythm will undoubtedly correspond en­
tirely to the technical environment.
The external structures imposed by technique can no longer, by 
themselves, modify the components of a society; here the internal 
influence of technique on the human being becomes decisive. 
Henceforth, every component of civilization is subject to the law 
that technique is itself civilization. Civilization no longer exists of 
itself. Every activity— intellectual, artistic, moral— is only a part of 
technique. This fact is so enormous and unpredictable that we 
are simply unable to foresee its consequences. Most of us, blinded 
by traditional and well-established situations, are unable to grasp 
its meaning. Henceforth, there will be no conflict between contend­
ing forces among which technique is only one. The victory of tech­
nique has already been secured. It is too late to set limits to it 
or to put it in doubt. The fatal flaw in all systems designed to 
counterbalance the power of technique is that they come too late.
Under these circumstances, it is understandable that technique, 
in all the lands it has penetrated, has exploded the local, national 
cultures. Two cultures, of which technique is one, cannot coexist. 
This does not mean, of course, that uniformity prevails. There are 
still great differences from region to region. But for the most part 
these differences are due to the fact that the vestiges of a civiliza­
tion lake a long time to disappear completely. Technique has al­
ready gained its victory over Buddhism. It is clear, however, that it 
will take two or three generations to modify the mode of life and 
thought engendered by Buddhism. A certain diversity will per­
sist while this inode of life is weakening. Technique does not lead 
to general uniformity. In fact, it creates a certain diversity. Its ob­
jectives are always the same, and so is its influence on man. But 
though it is axiomatic that the one best way will prevail, this one 
best way will vary with climate, country, and population. The more 
technique is refined, the more it varies its means of action. There­
fore, we shall continue to have the appearance of different civili­
zations in India and in Greenland. They will indeed be different in 
certain aspects. But their essence will be identical; they will be 
techniques. And what differences there are will result from the cold
The Technological Society ( 1 3 1
calculation of some technician, instead of being the result of the 
profound spiritual and material effort of generations of human be­
ings. Instead of being the expression of man’s essence, they will be 
the accidents of what is essential: technique.
The differences which exist today are therefore without impor­
tance in relation to the fact of technical identity. The differences 
to come will bear upon the most diverse activities and give the 
illusion of liberty. But they will nevertheless be no more than the 
expression of the monism of technique. Geographically and quali­
tatively, technique is universal in its manifestations. It is devoted, 
by nature and necessity, to the universal. It could not be otherwise. 
It depends upon a science itself devoted to the universal, and it is 
becoming the universal language understood by all men. We need 
not belabor the fact, which everyone recognizes, that science is uni­
versal. And this fact in turn leads of necessity to the technical uni- 
versalism which stems from it.
The second of the two elements we referred to (production and 
social relations) requires more explication. In his relation to the 
world, man has always made use of multiple means, none of which 
were universal because none were objective. Technique is a means 
of apprehending reality, of acting on the world, which allows us to 
neglect all individual differences, all subjectivity. Technique alone 
is rigorously objective. It blots out all personal opinions. It effaces 
all individual, and even all collective, modes of expression. Today 
man lives by virtue of his participation in a truth become objective. 
Technique is no more than a neutral bridge between reality and 
the abstract man.
Technique, moreover, creates a bond between men. All those 
who follow the same technique are bound together in a tacit 
fraternity and all of them take the same attitude toward reality. 
There is no need for them to converse together or to understand 
one another. A  team of surgeons and assistants who know the tech­
nique of a given operation have no need to address one another in 
order that the necessary motions be correctly performed at the right 
moment.
Industrial labor likewise tends more and more to dispense with 
orders and personal contact. This was pushed to an extreme in the 
concentration camps, where men of different nations were mixed 
together so that they should have no contacts and yet be able to
THE CHARACTEROU OF TECHNIQUB
perform collective work. It was hasty and superficial work, to be 
sure, but a little more rigor could easily make this labor really pro­
ductive (as seems to be the case in the Soviet Union). One cannot 
speak merely of isolation. These men work in teams, but there is 
no need for them to know or understand one another. They need 
only understand the technique involved and know in advance what 
their teammate will do. It is not necessary for the crew to under­
stand one another in order to run an aircraft The indicator panel 
controls the actions to be performed; and every crew member, sub­
mitting by necessity and conscience to the automatic indications, 
obeys for the safety of all. Each man’s actions are dictated by the 
conditions of life and its preservation. This is clear in the case of 
flying an aircraft But it is equally clear in every other situation in­
volving technique— and this encompasses the most important areas 
of life. Men do not need to understand each other in order to cany 
out the most important endeavors of our times.
Technique is of necessity, and as compensation, our universal 
language. It is the fruit of specialization. But this very specializa­
tion prevents mutual understanding. Everyone today has his own 
professional jargon, modes of thought, and peculiar perception of 
the world. There was a time when the distortion of overspecializa­
tion was the butt of jokes and a subject for vaudeville. Today the 
sharp knife of specialization has passed like a razor into the living 
flesh. It has cut the umbilical cord which linked men with each 
other and with nature. The man of today is no longer able to under­
stand his neighbor because his profession is his whole life, and the 
technical specialization of this life has forced him to live in a closed 
universe. He no longer understands the vocabulary of the others. 
Nor does he comprehend the underlying motivations of the others. 
Yet technique, having ruptured the relalions between man and 
man, proceeds to rebuild the bridge which links them. It bridges 
the specializations because it produces a new type of man always 
and everywhere like his duplicate, who develops along technical 
lines. He listens to himself and speaks to himself, but he obeys 
the slightest indications of the apparatus, confident that his neigh­
bor will do the same. Technique has become the bond between 
men. By its agency they communicate, whatever their languages, 
beliefs, or race. It has become, for life or death, the universal lan­
guage which compensates for all the deficiencies and separations it
The Technological Society (13 3
has itsel{ produced. This is the major reason for the great impetus 
of technique toward the universal.
The Autonomy of Technique. The primary aspect of autonomy is 
perfectly expressed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, a leading tech­
nician. He takes, as his point of departure, the view that the in­
dustrial plant is a whole in itself, a 'closed organism,” an end in 
itself. Ciedion adds: “What is fabricated in this plant and what is 
the goal of its labor— these are questions outside its design.” The 
complete separation of the goal from the mechanism, the limita­
tion of the problem to the means, and the refusal to interfere in 
any way with efficiency; all this is clearly expressed b y  Taylor and 
lies at the basis of technical autonomy.
Autonomy is the essential condition for the development of tech­
nique, as Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt’s study of the police clearly 
indicates. The police must be independent if they are to become ef­
ficient. They must form a closed, autonomous organization in or­
der to operate by the most direct and efficient means and not be 
shackled by subsidiary considerations. And in this autonomy, they 
must be self-confident in respect to the law. It matters little whether 
police action is legal, if it is efficient. The rules obeyed by a techni­
cal organization are no longer rules of justice or injustice. They are 
“laws” in a purely technical sense. As far as the police are con­
cerned, the highest stage is reached when the legislature legalizes 
their independence of the legislature itself and recognizes the pri­
macy of technical laws. This is the opinion of Best, a leading Ger­
man specialist in police matters.
The autonomy of technique must be examined in different per­
spectives on the basis of the different spheres in relation to which 
it has this characteristic. First, technique is autonomous with re­
spect to economics and politics. We have already seen that, at the 
present, neither economic nor political evolution conditions tech­
nical progress. Its progress is likewise independent of the social 
situation. The converse is actually the case, a point I shall develop 
at length. Technique elicits and conditions social, political, and eco­
nomic change. It is the prime mover of all the rest, in spite of any 
appearance to the contrary and in spite of human pride, which pre­
tends that man’s philosophical theories are still determining influ­
ences and man’s political regimes decisive factors in technical 
evolution. External necessities no longer determine technique.
TOE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUE134)
Technique’s own internal necessities are determinative. Technique 
has become a reality in itself, self-sufficient, with its special laws 
and its own determinations.
Let us not deceive ourselves on this point. Suppose that the 
state, for example, intervenes in a technical domain. Either it inter­
venes for sentimental, theoretical, or intellectual reasons, and the 
effect of its intervention will be negative or nil; or it intervenes for 
reasons of political technique, and we have the combined effect of 
two techniques. There is no other possiblity. The historical experi­
ence of the last years shows this fully.
To go one step further, technical autonomy is apparent in respect 
to morality and spiritual values. Technique tolerates no judgment 
from without and accepts no limitation. It is by virtue of technique 
rather than science that the great principle has become established: 
chacun chez soi. Morality judges moral problems; as far as techni­
cal problems are concerned, it has nothing to say. Only technical 
criteria are relevant. Technique, in sitting in judgment on itself, is 
clearly freed from this principal obstacle to human action. 
(Whether the obstacle is valid is not the question here. For the 
.moment we merely record that it is an obstacle.) Thus, technique 
theoretically and systematically assures to itself that liberty which 
it has been able to win practically. Since it has put itself beyond 
good and evil, it need fear no limitation whatever. It was long 
claimed that technique was neutral. Today this is no longer a use­
ful distinction. The power and autonomy of technique are so well 
secured that it, in its turn, has become the judge of what is moral, 
the creator of a new morality. Thus, it plays the role of creator of a 
new civilization as well. This morality— internal to technique— is 
assured of not having to suffer from technique. In any case, in re­
spect to traditional morality, technique affirms itself as an inde­
pendent power. Man alone is subject, it would seem, to moral judg­
ment. We no longer live in that primitive epoch in which things 
were good or bad in themselves. Technique in itself is neither, and 
can therefore do what it will. It is truly autonomous.
However, technique cannot assert its autonomy in respect to 
physical or biological laws. Instead, it puts them to work; it seeks 
to dominate them.
Giedion, in his probing study of mechanization and the manu­
facture of bread, shows that “wherever mechanization encounters
The Technological Society (13 5
a living substance, bacterial or animal, the organic substance deter­
mines the laws.” For this reason, the mechanization of bakeries was 
a failure. More subdivisions, intervals, and precautions of various 
kinds were required in the mechanized bakery than in the non- 
mechanized bakery. The size of the machines did not save time; 
it merely gave work to larger numbers of people. Giedion shows 
how the attempt was made to change the nature of the bread in 
order to adapt it to mechanical manipulations. In the last resort, 
the ultimate success of mechanization turned on the transformation 
of human taste. Whenever technique collides with a natural obsta­
cle, it tends to get around it either by replacing the living organism 
by a machine, or by modifying the organism so that it no longer 
presents any specifically organic reaction.
The same phenomenon is evident in yet another area in which 
technical autonomy asserts itself: the relations between techniques 
and man. We have already seen, in connection with technical self­
augmentation, that technique pursues its own course more and 
more independently of man. This means that man participates less 
and less actively in technical creation, which, by the automatic 
combination of prior elements, becomes a kind of fate Man is re­
duced to the level of a catalyst. Better still, he resembles a slug in­
serted into a slot machine: he starts the operation without partici­
pating in it
But this autonomy with respect to man goes much further. To the 
degree that technique must attain its result with mathematical pre­
cision, it has for its object the elimination of all human variability 
and elasticity. It is a commonplace to say that the machine replaces 
the human being. But it replaces him to a greater degree than has 
been believed.
Industrial technique will soon succeed in completely replacing 
the effort of the worker, and it would do so even sooner if capital­
ism were not an obstacle. The worker, no longer needed to guide or 
move the machine to action, will be required merely to watch it 
and to repair it when it breaks down. He will not participate in the 
work any more than a boxer’s manager participates in a prize fight. 
This is no dream. The automated factory has already been realized 
for a great number of operations, and it is realizable for a far greater 
number. Examples multiply from day to day in all areas. Man indi­
cates how this automation and its attendant exclusion of men op-
136 ) THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE
erates in business offices; for example, in the case of the so-called 
tabulating machine. The machine itself interprets the data, the ele­
mentary bits of information fed into it. It arranges them in texts 
and distinct numbers. It adds them together and classifies the re­
sults in groups and subgroups, and so on. We have here an ad­
ministrative circuit accomplished by a single, self-controlled ma­
chine. It is scarcely necessary to dwell on the astounding growth of 
automation in the last ten years. The multiple applications of the 
automatic assembly line, of automatic control of production opera­
tions (so-called cybernetics) are well known. Another case in point 
is the automatic pilot. Until recently the automatic pilot was used 
only in rectilinear flight; the finer operations were carried out by 
the living pilot. As early as 1952 the automatic pilot effected the 
operations of take-off and landing for certain supersonic aircraft 
The same kind of feat is performed by automatic direction finders 
in anti-aircraft defense. Man’s role is limited to inspection. This 
automation results from the development servomechanisms which 
act as substitutes for human beings in more and more subtle opera­
tions by virtue of their “feedback' capacity.
This progressive elimination of man from the circuit must Inexo­
rably continue. Is the elimination of man so unavoidably necessary? 
Certainly! Freeing man from toil is in itself an ideal. Beyond 
this, every intervention of man, however educated or used to ma­
chinery he may be, is a source of error and unpredictability. The 
combination of man and technique is a happy one only if man has 
no responsibility. Otherwise, he is ceaselessly tempted to make un­
predictable choices and is susceptible to emotional motivations 
which invalidate the mathematical precision of the machinery. He 
is also susceptible to fatigue and discouragement. All this disturbs 
the forward thrust of technique.
Man must have nothing decisive to perform in the course of 
technical operations; after all, he is the source of error. Political 
technique is still troubled by certain unpredictable phenomena, in 
spite of all the precision of the apparatus and the skill of those in­
volved. (But this technique is still in its childhood.) In human re­
actions, howsoever well calculated they may be; a “coefficient of 
elasticity' causes imprecision, and imprecision is intolerable to 
technique. As far as possible, this source of error must be elimi­
nated. Eliminate the individual, and excellent results ensue. Any
The Technological Society (13 7
technical man who is aware of this fact is forced to support the 
opinions voiced by Robert Jungk, which can be summed up thus: 
T h e  individual is a brake on progress.” Or: “Considered from the 
modem technical point of view, man is a useless appendage.” For 
instance, ten per cent of all telephone calls are wrong numbers, due 
to human error. An excellent use by man of so perfect an apparatus!
Now that statistical operations are carried out by perforated- 
card machines instead of human beings, they have become exact 
Machines no longer perform merely gross operations. They perform 
a whole complex of subtle ones as well. And before long— what 
with the electronic brain— they will attain an intellectual power of 
which man is incapable.
Thus, the “great changing of the guard” is occurring much 
more extensively than Jacques Duboin envisaged some decades 
ago. Gaston Bouthoul, a leading sociologist of the phenomena of 
war, concludes that war breaks out in a social group when there 
is a “plethora of young men surpassing the indispensable tasks of 
the economy.” When for one reason or another these men are not 
employed, they become ready for war. It is the multiplication of 
men who are excluded from working which provokes war. W e 
ought at least to bear this in mind when we boast of the continual 
decrease in human participation in technical operations.
However, there are spheres in which it is impossible to eliminate 
human influence. The autonomy of technique then develops in an­
other direction. Technique is not, for example, autonomous in re­
spect to clock time. Machines, like abstract technical laws, are 
subject to the law of speed, and co-ordination presupposes time 
adjustment. In his description of the assembly line, Giedion writes: 
“Extremely precise time tables guide the automatic cooperation of 
the instruments, which, like the atoms in a planetary system, consist 
of separate units but gravitate with respect to each other in obedi­
ence to their inherent laws.” This image shows in a remarkable way 
how technique became simultaneously independent of man and 
obedient to the chronometer. Technique obeys its own specific 
laws, as every machine obeys laws. Each element of the technical 
complex follows certain laws determined by its relations with the 
other elements, and these laws are internal to the system and in no 
way influenced by external factors. It is not a question of causing 
the human being to disappear, but of making him capitulate, of in-
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE
during him to accommodate himself to techniques and not to ex­
perience personal feelings and reactions.
No technique is possible when men are free. When technique 
enters into the realm of social life, it collides ceaselessly with the 
human being to the degree that the combination of man and tech­
nique is unavoidable, and that technical action necessarily results 
in a determined result. Technique requires predictability and, 
no less, exactness of prediction. It is necessary, then, that technique 
prevail over the human being. For technique, this is a matter of life 
or death. Technique must reduce man to a technical animal, the 
king of the slaves of technique. Human caprice crumbles before 
this necessity; there can be no human autonomy in the face of tech­
nical autonomy. The individual must be fashioned by techniques, 
either negatively (by the techniques of understanding man) or 
positively (by the adaptation of man to the technical framework), 
in order to wipe out the blots his personal determination introduces 
into the perfect design of the organization.
But it is requisite that man have certain precise inner charac­
teristics. An extreme example is the atomic worker or the jet pilot. 
He must be of calm temperament, and even temper, he must be 
phlegmatic, he must not have too much initiative, and he must be 
devoid of egotism. The ideal jet pilot is already along in years 
(perhaps thirty-five) and has a settled direction in life. He flies 
his jet in the way a good civil servant goes to his office. Human 
joys and sorrows are fetters on technical aptitude. Jungk cites the 
case of a test pilot who had to abandon his profession because 
"his wife behaved in such a way as to lessen his capacity to fly. 
Every day, when he returned home, he found her shedding tears of 
joy. Having become in this way accident conscious, he dreaded 
catastrophe when he had to face a delicate situation." The individ­
ual who is a servant of technique must be completely unconscious 
of himself. Without this quality, his reflexes and his inclinations are 
not properly adapted to technique.
Moreover, the physiological condition of the individual must an­
swer to technical demands. Jungk gives an impressive picture of 
the experiments in training and control that jet pilots have to 
undergo. The pilot is whilred on centrifuges until he “blacks out” 
(in order to measure his toleration of acceleration). There are cata­
pults, ultrasonic chambers, etc., in which the candidate is forced
The Technological Society (139
to undergo unheard-of tortures in order to determine whether he 
has adequate resistance and whether he is capable of piloting the 
new machines. That the human organism is, technically speaking, 
an imperfect one is demonstrated by the experiments. The suffer­
ings the individual endures in these “laboratories” are considered 
to be due to “biological weaknesses,” which must be eliminated. 
New experiments have pushed even further to determine the re­
actions of “space pilots” and to prepare these heroes for their roles 
of tomorrow. This has given birth to new sciences, biometry for 
example; their one aim is to create the new man, the man adapted 
to technical functions.
It will be objected that these examples are extreme. This is cer­
tainly the case, but to a greater or lesser degree the same prob­
lem exists everywhere. And the more technique evolves, the more 
extreme its character becomes. The object of all the modem “hu­
man sciences” (which I will examine later on) is to find answers 
to these problems.
The enormous effort required to put this technical civilization 
into motion supposes that all individual effort is directed toward 
this goal alone and that all social forces are mobilized to attain the 
mathematically perfect structure of the edifice. (“Mathematically” 
does not mean “rigidly.” The perfect technique is the most adapta­
ble and, consequently, the most plastic one. True technique will 
know how to maintain the illusion of liberty, choice, and individ­
uality; but these will have been carefully calculated so that they 
will be integrated into the mathematical reality merely as appear­
ances!) Henceforth it will be wrong for a man to escape this 
universal effort. It will be inadmissible for any part of the individ­
ual not to be integrated in the drive toward technicization; it will be 
inadmissible that any man even aspire to escape this necessity of 
the whole society. The individual will no longer be able, materially 
or spiritually, to disengage himself from society. Materially, he will 
not be able to release himself because the technical means are so 
numerous that they invade his whole life and make it impossible 
for him to escape the collective phenomena. There is no longer an 
uninhabited place, or any other geographical locale, for the 
would-be solitary. It is no longer possible to refuse entrance into 
a community to a highway, a high-tension line, or a dam. It is vain 
to aspire to live alone when one is obliged to participate in all col-
THE CHARACTEROLOCT OF TECHNIQUE140)
lective phenomena and to use all the collective’s tools, without 
which it is impossible to earn a bare subsistence. Nothing is gratis 
any longer in our society; and to live on charity is less and less 
possible. ‘‘Social advantages” are for the workers alone, not for “use­
less mouths.” The solitary is a useless mouth and will have no ration 
card— up to the day he is transported to a penal colony. (An at­
tempt was made to institute this procedure during the French Rev­
olution, with deportations to Cayenne.)
Spiritually, it will be impossible for the individual to disassociate 
himself from society. This is due not to the existence of spiritual 
techniques which have increasing force in our society, but rather to 
our situation. We are constrained to be “engaged,” as the existen­
tialists say, with technique. Positively or negatively, our spiritual 
attitude is constantly urged, if not determined, by this situation. 
Only bestiality, because it is unconscious, would seem to escape 
this situation, and it is itself only a product of the machine.
Every conscious being today is walking the narrow ridge of a 
decision with regard to technique. He who maintains that he can 
escape it is either a hypocrite or unconscious. The autonomy of 
technique forbids the man of today to choose his destiny. Doubt­
less, someone will ask if it has not always been the case that social 
conditions, environment, manorial oppression, and the family con­
ditioned man’s fate. The answer is, of course, yes. But there is no 
common denominator between the suppression of ration cards in 
an authoritarian state and the family pressure of two centuries ago. 
In the past, when an individual entered into conflict with society, 
he led a harsh and miserable life that required a vigor which ei­
ther hardened or broke him. Today the concentration camp and 
death await him; technique cannot tolerate aberrant activities.
Because of the autonomy of technique, modern man cannot 
choose his means any more than his ends. In spite of variability and 
flexibility according to place and circumstance (which are charac­
teristic of technique) there is still only a single employable tech­
nique in the given place and time in which an individual is situ­
ated. We have already examined the reasons for this.
At this point, we must consider the major consequences of the 
autonomy of technique. This will bring us to the climax of this 
analysis.
Technical autonomy explains the “specific weight” with which
The Techndogical Society (141
technique is endowed. It is not a kind of neutral matter, with no 
direction, quality, or structure. It is a power endowed with its own 
peculiar force. It refracts in its own specific sense the wills which 
make use of it and the ends porposed for it. Indeed, independently 
of the objectives that man pretends to assign to any given technical 
means, that means always conceals in itself a finality which cannot 
be evaded. And if there is a competition between this intrinsic final­
ity and an extrinsic end proposed by man, it is always the intrinsic 
finality which carries the day. If the technique in question is not 
exactly adapted to a proposed human end, and if an individual pre­
tends that he is adapting the technique to this end, it is generally 
quickly evident that it is the end which is being modified, not the 
technique. Of course, this statement must be qualified by what has 
already been said concerning the endless refinement of techniques 
and their adaptation. But this adaptation is effected with reference 
to the techniques concerned and to the conditions of their applica­
bility. It does not depend on external ends. Perrot has demon­
strated this in the case of judicial techniques, and Giedion in the 
case of mechanical techniques. Concerning the over-all problem of 
the relation between the ends and the means, I take the liberty 
of referring to my own work, Presence au monde modeme.
Once again we are faced with a choice of 'all or nothing.' If 
we make use of technique, we must accept the specificity and 
autonomy of its ends, and the totality of its rules. Our own desires 
and aspirations can change nothing.
The second consequence of technical autonomy is that it renders 
technique at once sacrilegious and sacred. (Sacrilegious is not used 
here in the theological but in the sociological sense.) Sociologists 
have recognized that the world in which man lives is for him not 
only a material but also a spiritual world; that forces act in it which 
are unknown and perhaps unknowable; that there are phenomena 
in it which man interprets as magical; that there are relations and 
correspondences between things and beings in which material con­
nections are of little consequence. This whole area is mysterious. 
Mystery (but not in the Catholic sense) is an element of man’s life. 
Jung has shown that it is catastrophic to make superficially clear 
what is hidden in man’s innermost depths. Man must make allow­
ance for a background, a great deep above which lie his reason and 
his clear consciousness. The mystery of man perhaps creates the
THE CHARACTEROLOGY OF TECHNIQUEI4 S )
mystery of the world he inhabits. Or perhaps this mystery is a real­
ity in itself. There is no way to decide between these two alterna­
tives. But, one way or the other, mystery is a necessity of human 
life.
Man cannot live without a sense of the secret The psychoana­
lysts agree on this point. But the invasion of technique desacralizes 
the world in which man is called upon to live. For technique noth­
ing is sacred, there is no mystery, no taboo. Autonomy makes this so. 
Technique does not accept the existence of rules outside itself, or 
of any norm. Still less will it accept any judgment upon it. As a 
consequence, no matter where it penetrates, what it does is per­
mitted, lawful, justified.
To a great extent, mystery is desired by man. It is not that he 
cannot understand, or enter into, or grasp mystery, but that he does 
not desire to do so. The sacred is what man decides unconsciously 
to respect. The taboo becomes compelling from a social standpoint, 
but there is always a factor of adoration and respect which does not 
derive from compulsion and fear.
Technique worships nothing, respects nothing. It has a single 
role: to strip off externals, to bring everything to light, and by ra­
tional use to transform everything into means. More than science, 
which limits itself to explaining the “how,” technique desacralizes 
because it demonstrates (by evidence and not by reason, through 
use and not through books) that mystery does not exist. Science 
brings to the light of day everything man had believed sacred. 
Technique takes possession of it and enslaves it. The sacred cannot 
resist. Science penetrates to the great depths of the sea to photo­
graph the unknown fish of the deep. Technique captures them, 
hauls them up to see if they are edible— but before they arrive on 
deck they burst. And why should technique not act thus? It is au­
tonomous and recognizes as barriers only the temporary limits of its 
action. In its eyes, this terrain, which is for the moment unknown 
but not mysterious, must be attacked. Far from being restrained by 
any scruples before the sacred, technique constantly assails it. 
Everything which is not yet technique becomes so. It is driven on­
ward by itself, by its character of self-augmentation. Technique 
denies mystery a priori. The mysterious is merely that which has 
not yet been technicized.
Technique advocates the entire remaking of life and its frame-

work because they have been badly made. Since heredity is full of 
chance, technique proposes to suppress it so as to engender the kind 
of men necessary for its ideal of service. The creation of the ideal 
man will soon be a simple technical operation. It is no longer neces­
sary to rely on the chances of the family or on the personal vigor 
which is called virtue. Applied biogenetics is an obvious point at 
which technique desacralizes;5  but we must not forget psycho­
analysis, which holds that dreams, visions, and the psychic life in 
general are nothing more than objects. Nor must we forget the pene­
tration and exploitation of the earth’s secrets. Crash programs, par­
ticularly in the United States, are attempting to reconstruct the soil 
which massive exploitation and the use of chemical fertilizers have 
impaired. We shall soon discover the functions of chlorophyll and 
thus entirely transform the conditions of life. Recent investigations 
in electronic techniques applied to biology have emphasized the 
importance of DNA and will possibly result in the discovery of the 
linkbetween the living and the nonliving.
Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the super­
natural. The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very 
well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere. But man cannot live 
without the sacred. He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred 
to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to tech­
nique itself. In the world in which we live, technique has become 
the essential mystery, taking widely diverse forms according to 
place and race. Those who have preserved some of the notions of 
magic both admire and fear technique. Radio presents an inex­
plicable mystery, an obvious and recurrent miracle. It is no less 
astonishing than the highest manifestations of magic once were, 
and it is worshipped as an idol would have been worshipped, with 
the same simplicity and fear.
But custom and the recurrence of the miracle eventually wear 
out this primitive adoration. It is scarcely found today in European 
countries; the proletariat, workers and peasants alike, with their 
motorcycles, radios, and electrical appliances, have an attitude of 
condescending pride toward the jinn who is their slave. Their ideal 
is incarnated in certain things which serve them. Yet they retain 
some feeling of the sacred, in the sense that life is not worth the
8 See, in this connection, the previous note.
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUEM 4 )
trouble of living unless a man has these jinns in his home. This 
attitude goes much further in the case of the conscious segment of 
the proletariat, among whom technique is seen as a whole and not 
merely in its occasional aspects. For them, technique is the instru­
ment of liberation for the proletariat. All that is needed is for tech­
nique to make a little more headway, and they will be freed pro­
portionately from their chains. Stalin pointed to industrialization 
as the sole condition for the realization of Communism. Every 
gain made by technique is a gain for the proletariat. This represents 
indeed a belief in the sacred. Technique is the god which brings 
salvation. It is good in its essence. Capitalism is an abomination 
because on occasion it opposes technique. Technique is the hope 
of the proletarians; they can have faith in it because its miracles are 
visible and progressive. A great part of their sense of the mysterious 
remains attached to it. Karl Marx may have been able to explain 
rationally how technique would free the proletariat, but the prole­
tariat itself is scarcely equal to a full understanding of this “how.” 
It remains mysterious for them. They retain merely the formula 
of faith. But their faith addresses itself with enthusiasm to the 
mysterious agent of their liberation.
The nonintellectual classes of the bourgeoisie are perhaps less 
caught up in this worship of technique. But the technicians of the 
bourgeoisie are without doubt the ones most powerfully taken with 
it. For them, technique is sacred, since they have no reason to 
feel a passion for it. Technical men are always disconcerted when 
one asks them the motives for their faith. No, they do not expect to 
be liberated; they expect nothing, yet they sacrifice themselves 
and devote their lives with frenzy to the development of industrial 
plants and the organization of banks. The happiness of the human 
race and suchlike nonsense are the commonplaces they allege. But 
these are no longer of any service even as justifications, and they 
certainly have nothing at all to do with man’s passion for technique.
The technician uses technique perhaps because it is his profes­
sion, but he does so with adoration because for him technique is 
the locus of the sacred. There is neither reason nor explanation in 
his attitude. The power of technique, mysterious though scientific, 
which covers the whole earth with its networks of waves, wires, 
and paper, is to the technician an abstract idol which gives him a
The Technological Society (145
reason for living and even for joy. One sign, among many, of the 
feeling of the sacred that man experiences in the face of technique 
is the care he takes to treat it with familiarity. Laughter and humor 
are common human reactions in the presence of the sacred. This is 
true for primitive peoples; and for the same reason the first atomic 
bomb was called “Gilda," the giant cyclotron of Los Alamos 
“Clementine,” the atomic piles “water pots,” and radioactive con­
tamination “scalding.” The technicians of Los Alamos have banned 
the word atom from their vocabulary. These things are significant.
In view of the very different forms of technique, there is no 
question of a technical religion. But there is associated with it the 
feeling of the sacred, which expresses itself in different ways. The 
way differs from man to man, but for all men the feeling of the 
sacred is expressed in this marvelous instrument of the power in­
stinct which is always joined to mystery and magic. The worker 
brags about his job because it offers him joyous confirmation of his 
superiority. The young snob speeds along at 100 m.p.h. in his 
Porsche. The technician contemplates with satisfaction the gradi­
ents of his charts, no matter what their reference is. For these men, 
technique is in every way sacred; it is the common expression of 
human power without which they would find themselves poor, 
alone, naked, and stripped of all pretentions. They would no longer 
be the heroes, geniuses, or archangels which a motor permits them 
to be at little expense.
What shall we say of the outburst of frenzy when the Sputnik 
went into orbit? What of the poems of the Soviets, the metaphysical 
affirmations of the French, the speculations on the conquest of the 
universe? What of the identification of this artificial satellite with 
the sun, or of its invention with the creation of the earth? And, on 
the other side of the Atlantic, what was the real meaning of the ex­
cessive consternation of the Americans? All these bore witness to a  
marked social attitude with regard to a simple technical fact.
Even people put out of work or ruined by technique, even those 
who criticize or attack it (without daring to go so far as to turn 
worshippers against them) have the bad conscience of all icono­
clasts. They find neither within nor without themselves a compen­
sating force for the one they call into question. They do not even 
live in despair, which would be a sign of their freedom. This bad
THE CHARACTEROLOCY OF TECHNIQUE146  )
conscience appears to me to be perhaps the most revealing fact 
about the new sacralization of modern technique.
The characteristics we have examined permit me to assert with 
confidence that there is no common denominator between the tech­
nique of today and that of yesterday. Today we are dealing with an 
utterly different phenomenon. Those who claim to deduce from 
man’s technical situation in past centuries his situation in this one 
show that they have grasped nothing of the technical phenomenon. 
These deductions prove that all their reasonings are without 
foundation and all their analogies are astigmatic.
The celebrated formula of Alain has been invalidated: "Tools, 
instruments of necessity, instruments that neither lie nor cheat, tools 
with which necessity can be subjugated by obeying her, without the 
help of false laws; tools that make it possible to conquer by obey­
ing.” This formula is true of the tool which puts man squarely in 
contact with a reality that will bear no excuses, in contact with mat­
ter to be mastered, and the only way to use it is to obey it. Obedi­
ence to the plow and the plane was indeed the only means of domi­
nating earth and wood. But the formula is not true for our 
techniques. He who serves these techniques enters another realm 
of necessity. This new necessity is not natural necessity; natural 
necessity, in fact, no longer exists. It is technique’s necessity, which 
becomes the more constraining the more nature’s necessity fades 
and disappears. It cannot be escaped or mastered. The tool was 
not false. But technique causes us to penetrate into the innermost 
realm of falsehood, showing us all the while the noble face of ob­
jectivity of result. In this innermost recess, man is no longer able to 
recognize himself because of the instruments he employs.
The tool enables man to conquer. But, man, dost thou not know 
there is no more victory which is thy victory? The victory of our 
days belongs to the tool. The tool alone has the power and carries 
off the victory. Man bestows on himself the laurel crown, after the 
example of Napoleon III, who stayed in Paris to plan the strategy 
of the Crimean War and claimed the bay leaves of the victor.
But this delusion cannot last much longer. The individual obeys 
and no longer has victory which is his own. He cannot have ac­
cess even to his apparent triumphs except by becoming himself the 
object of technique and the offspring of the mating of man and
The Technological Society (*47
machine. AH his accounts are falsified. Alain’s definition no longer 
corresponds to anything in the modem world. In writing this, I 
have, of course, omitted innumerable facets of our world. There are 
still artisans, petty tradesmen, butchers, domestics, and small agri­
cultural landowners. But theirs are the faces of yesterday, the more 
or less hardy survivals of our past. Our world is not made of these 
static residues of history, and I have attempted to consider only 
moving forces. In the complexity of the present world, residues do 
exist, but they have no future and are consequently disappearing.
Only the things which have a future interest us. But how are we 
to discern them? By making a comparison of three planes of civili­
zation which coexist today: India, Western Europe, and the United 
States. And by considering the line of historical progression from 
one to the other— all of this powerfully reinforced by the evolution 
of the Soviet Union, which is causing history to boil.
In this chapter we have sketched the psychology of the tyrant. 
Now we must study his biology: the circulatory apparatus, the 
state; the digestive apparatus, the economy; the cellular tissue, man.

TECHNIQUE 
AND ECONOMY
There is a certain nai'vet6 in wishing to treat the problem of eco­
nomic technique in a few pages, and it seems completely useless 
to take up once again a question so frequently studied. But, as in 
the book as a whole, I do not mean to address myself exclusively to 
those aspects of the problem which are traditionally considered, 
that is, to the facts. The facts, figures, statistics (well or little 
known) form the background and foundation of my inquiry. It 
seems unnecessary to reiterate them. They can be found in many 
books, so I shall continue with the “cursive” method I have hitherto 
employed. By encircling the facts, I shall emphasize their impor­
tance; and on the basis of the data given, I shall seek to derive 
new aspects and “lines of force” for new studies. It might be asked 
whether, this has not already been done and is hence unnecesary. 
But this inquiry presupposes that we have escaped not only from 
sole preoccupation with brute facts but from formal logic as well 
Neither gives an account of reality. The point is to let oneself be 
guided by a kind of logic internal to facts and things. It is useless 
to speak of “laws.” I am opposed to the attitude, represented for ex-
The Technological Society (14 9
ample by the works of Fourasti6, which combines elements on the 
basis of pure logic, yielding a terribly linear and inhuman result. 
I am likewise opposed to the attitude, characteristic of the majority 
of Western intellectuals, which, having taken account of the facts, 
denies them forthwith by avowals of hope and assertions of the cer­
tainty of human freedom— which is anything but scientific. This 
attitude can be reduced to the conviction that the reality of things 
is simply too frightful to behold. Instead of guiding themselves by 
reality, most investigators of the problem adopt an attitude flatly 
contradicted by all the events of modern times. This attitude might 
be summarized as follows: “The facts are the elements of a game 
of patience which is amorphous and has no form of its own. The 
individual is perfectly at liberty among these facts to arrange the 
pieces of the game as he will and to elaborate a voluntary and hu­
mane economy.”
I take an extreme view but one that I believe is closer to reality. 
I see that the facts have their form and their specific weight. They 
respect neither freedom of the individual nor formal logic. I am 
striving in this essay to find their special consistency and their com­
mon tendencies, and to discover whether man still has a place in 
this tangle; whether he still has any authority among these colossal 
masses in movement; whether he still can exert any force whatever 
on the statistics which are slipping from his hands into the abstract 
and the unreal. Can he have a place, authority, and the pos­
sibility of action on. a better basis than ill-founded declarations of 
hope or blind acts of unreasonable faith?
The Best and the Worst
The Influence of Technique on the Economy. Let us consider first 
the aspect of the relation between technique and economy which 
is traditionally studied, particularly by Marx. Technique, or rather 
techniques, appears as the motive force and the foundation of the 
economy. Without them, there is no economy. For this reason, a 
distinction can be made in economics between dynamic force, 
which is technical invention, and static force, the organization of 
the economy. Marx distinguishes between the system of production 
and the system of distribution: the former revolutionary, the latter
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY*5°)
necessarily conservative. It is self-deception to put economics at the 
base of the Marxist system. It is technique upon which all the rest 
depends. But the distinction made by Marx must be revised, for 
it is no longer true that technique plays its role in the realm of pro­
duction alone. Distribution, too, is to a great degree modified by 
techniques. Indeed, no area of economic life is today independent 
of technical development. It is to Fourastie’s credit that he pointed 
out that technical development controls all contemporary economic 
evolution, from production operations to demography. (There is no 
doubt that world population growth is related to the increase in 
consumption.) Even more abstract spheres are shown by Four- 
astie to be dominated by technical progress; for example, the price 
mechanism, capital evolution, foreign trade, population displace­
ment, unemployment, and so on.
This invasion of all economic activity by technique seems today 
indisputable. O f course the problem had been raised by economists 
before Fourastie, if not in full, at least to a certain degree. In an ef­
fort to explain crises, Gottfried Haberler, in Prosperity and De­
pression, ascribed their existence to inequality of technical develop­
ment in different branches of economic activity. The success of a 
technique leads to its full development; technique will tend to reach 
the limits of its possible development in a given area. The result is, 
first, an inequality of power in the various areas of the economy, 
which provokes an unblancing of the whole system; and second, 
a diminution of plasticity of the economic milieu. Technical prog­
ress entails stasis in one part or other of the system; the economy 
is strained to the full and loses all possibility of adaptation, bar­
ring, of course, a complete breakdown. The crisis then results from 
the fact that the system cannot progress, economically, at the same 
tempo in all its parts.
Henri Guitton returns to this idea when he notes that the adap­
tive mechanisms which were active during the nineteenth century 
have become more and more hampered. This disturbance seems to 
be attributable to the loss of structural elasticity. A structure suita­
ble to simplified mechanisms, lighter, so to speak (the old world had 
not accumulated as many innovations as the new), is no longer 
adapted to the exigencies of growth of a world no longer young.
In an altogether different field, John Maynard Keynes has also 
shown in his work, General Theory, that technical progress is an
The Technological Society ( 1 5 1
indispensable factor in the economy. The economic world cannot 
remain stationary. It is unceasingly called on to evolve. In particu­
lar, the importance of technical progress is central to the theory of 
investment. All the possibilities of labor must be utilized at any 
price. It is necessary constantly to uncover new possibilities of in­
vestment. For, says Keynes, the more numerous the consumers’ 
goods— the production of which has been provided for in advance 
— the more difficult it is to find corresponding new needs— which 
must likewise be anticipated and which call for new investments. 
What Keynes in fact fears is that there will not be sufficient new 
possibilities of investment. There is only one way to ensure limit­
less possibilities. These possibilities have nothing to do with spon­
taneous human needs, but involve technical discovery and applica­
tion, which create new products to replace the old, and also stimu­
late the need for these products. Technical progress is therefore a 
decisive factor in the progression of investment. The epicentric po­
sition of the theory of investment in Keynes’s system is well known. 
If a Byzantine phase of technical arrest were to occur in the eco­
nomic realm, it would represent not only an arrest of economic 
evolution but a regression as well, with a resultant series of deep 
crises.
In a closely related sense, a great importance is attached to tech­
nique both by those who hold and by those who reject the theory 
of economic maturity. According to this theory, only ceaseless tech­
nical progress can compensate for the causes of depression which 
become manifest in an economy that has arrived at maturity. 
These causes of depression are decline in the rate of population 
growth and limitation of geographic expansion— two factors which 
entail a decrease in the rate of investment. Technical progress could 
remedy this but, according to the initiator of the theory, technique 
shares in the decrease, not absolutely, but relatively. Technical 
progress no longer occurs rapidly enough to compensate for the 
other factors. Not even the opponents of this theory repudiate the 
importance of the technical factor, and that is what interests 11s 
here.
Yet another element of economic life ought not to be neglected: 
agricultural production. In this case, too, the upheaval brought 
about by techniques is a radical one. We have already noted the 
danger to the earth itself. As to the benefits and the penetration of
is*) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY
technique into farm labor, it suffices to refer the interested reader to 
Giedion s work. But I must insist on one point: as a result of the 
influence of techniques, the modern world is faced with a kind of 
“unblocking of peasant life and mentality." For a long time peasant 
tradition resisted innovation, and the old agricultural systems pre­
served their stability. Today technical transformation is an estab­
lished fact; the peasant revolution is in process or already com­
pleted, and everywhere in the same direction The actual extent of 
the progress of this revolution is of small importance; what counts 
is the first step, which permits the barriers of tradition to be hur­
dled. The peasant becomes conscious of the inferiority of his tradi­
tions; the usual justifications are held in contempt and the peasant 
world passes from the irrational to the rational. Once again we en­
counter the notion that technique destroys traditional forms of civi­
lization and introduces instead a global unity. What does this un­
blocking mean for the future? In the years to come we shall witness 
an acceleration of technical progress in rural life, and an accelera­
tion of already perceptible phenomena: peasant emigration, agri­
cultural specialization, deforestation, and the growth of agricultu­
ral production in general. These events are of major importance in 
view of the fact that agricultural production still remains the basis 
of economic life; and that the countries of the world most depend­
ent on industry, Great Britain and Japan, have not reached as high 
a standard of living as the United States because of the lack of suf­
ficient cultivable lands. The economic repercussions of this type of 
technical progress are easily grasped.
These examples, chosen arbitrarily from different social areas, 
show that the influence of technique on economic life is much more 
widespread and profound than classical manuals of economics 
would have us believe.
Moreover, all this is implied in the elementary observation that 
the progress of production closely depends on technical progress. 
It is at the present a truism to say that a new, general economic 
organization corresponds to certain new forms of production.
This dependence of the economy on techniques and primarily 
on machines has come about in an irrational way. It is not the ac­
tion of clear and certain causes which have produced this interde­
pendence. Veblen asks whether machines do not squander more
The Technological Society ( i S3
effort and material than they save; whether they do not cause grave 
economic losses by the developments they bring about in means of 
transport, etc. The same questions are put by Bertrand Bussell and 
still more emphatically by Gaston Bardet, who points to the enor­
mous waste of human forces, of time, work, and capital, occa­
sioned by the social structures conditioned by the machine. These 
are indeed simple questions, but important ones.
We see, then, that the influence of technique on the economy 
does not arise from an indisputable economic superiority of the ma­
chine. Ideas and theories no longer dominate, but rather the power 
of production. The industrial revolution of the nineteenth century 
resulted immediately from the technical advances of that time; this 
relation has not changed. Marx was unquestionably right with re­
spect to the period from about 1830 to the present; the motive force 
of all economic evolution has indeed been technical development. 
However, Marx was not necessarily right with respect to other pe­
riods of history. Technical progress has not always been the basic 
principle. We have already shown the contrary. Moreover, this does 
not mean that the consequences Marx draws from his contention 
are true. All we need do is note that Marx’s observation is correct: 
the more we advance into the new world, the more is economic life 
dependent on technical development.
Economic Consequences. As Jean Marchal says, “the accumula­
tion of machines transforms the economy.” We know that technique 
is not equivalent to the machine, and Marchal’s statement is even 
truer when technique is considered in my more general sense. 
Furthermore, his formula, which historically is more or less exact, 
tends to appear all the more exact in view of the economic dis­
turbances caused, for example, by automation. A simplistic view of 
the automated economy proclaims ease and abundance for all 
men, thanks to technique. But, unfortunately, this is not so sim­
ple. We are, in fact, confronted with a phenomenon which will 
produce a veritable economic mutation. None of the economic 
modalities (salaries, distribution, reduction of the work week, trans­
fer of the labor force from one area to another, disturbance of the 
balance of production in the various areas) seems capable of reso­
lution in the present state of affairs. Even the socialist economic 
structure is not adapted to receive the massive effects of automa-
1 5 4) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY
tion. This has been avowed by the Soviet economists themselves in 
their research into the effects of automation in the light of Marxism.
Returning to Marchal’s formula, we might ask in what direction 
this transformation acts. If we consider certain traits of technical 
progress of concern to the economy, we note that they all move in 
the same direction. Let us recall that technical means are becom­
ing more and more enormous and costly. Consider, for example, 
(a) the ever more numerous machines that are necessary to pro­
duction, which act more rapidly, are always being improved upon, 
and are subject to frequent replacement because of constant inven­
tive progress; (b) the organization of labor, which implies more 
and more numerous and costly personnel, which, although indis­
pensable, is not always immediately forthcoming; (c) publicity 
techniques. In all these economic means the same fact is to be 
noted, the investment of enormous amounts of nonproductive capi­
tal. Capital in such amounts can no longer be owned by a single per­
son and economic activity is beyond the range of individual possi­
bilities. But technical progress cannot do without the concentration 
of capital. An economy based on individual enterprise is not con­
ceivable, barring an extraordinary technical regression. The neces­
sary concentration of capital thus gives rise either to an economy of 
corporations or to a state economy.
A concentration of enterprise corresponds to this concentration 
of capital. This fact can hardly be denied today, especially in view 
of the power of these enterprises. Two examples from the United 
States: In 1939, 52 per cent of all industrial capital was held by 
0.1 per cent of the total number of enterprises; and in 1944, 62 per 
cent of all workers were employed in 2 per cent of American enter­
prises. A similar concentration of banking facilities exists. O f 30,000 
banks in the United States in 1920, only 15,000 were left in 1956. 
There were 350 mergers in 1955 alone. The situation became so evi­
dent that in 1956 the Federal Reserve Board undertook a campaign 
against this concentration.
This tendency toward concentration is confirmed daily, as Joseph 
Lajugie shows. The important thing is to recognize the real motive 
force behind it. The human and social effects of this concentration 
are, on the whole, evil. In a great corporation, the workers are 
more than ever enslaved and scarcely in a position to act in a dis­
tinctively human way. Even the consumer is frequently imposed
The Technological Society (255
upon. The integration of the individual into the technical complex 
is more complete than ever before.
From the purely economic point of view, the value of the results 
is highly debatable. It would seem, from the point of view of the 
market economy, that concentration should be a markedly favora­
ble factor. It involves, for example, suppression of competition and 
a tendency to raise prices. But, more striking still, concentration does 
not result in growth of profits. In many branches of production, 
profit growth is arrested or even declines when the transition is 
made from the medium-size enterprise to the large corporation.
What, then, is the motive force behind this concentration? Tech­
nique alone. A number of elements in technique demand concen­
tration. Mechanical technique requires it because only a very large 
corporation is in a position at the present to take advantage of the 
most recent inventions. Only the large corporation is able to apply 
normalization, to recover waste products profitably, and to manu­
facture byproducts. Technique applied to problems of labor effi­
ciency requires concentration because only through concentration 
is it possible to apply up-to-date methods which have gone far be­
yond the techniques of the former efficiency and time-study experts 
(for instance, the application of techniques of industrial relations). 
Finally, economic technique demands both vertical and horizontal 
concentration, which permits stockpiling at more favorable prices, 
accelerated capital turnover, reduction of fixed charges, assurance 
of markets, and so on.
Technical progress thus entails concentration. But this concen­
tration represents real advantages only in the technical domain. The 
impulse to concentrate is so strong that it takes place even contrary 
to the decisions of the state. In the United States and in France, 
the state has often opposed concentration, but ultimately it has 
always been forced to capitulate and to stand by impotently while 
the undesired development occurs. This confirms my judgment con­
cerning the decisive action of technique on the modem economy.
What is more, the technique of organization renders the inter­
vention of the state indispensable.
The necessity of normalizing products is no longer debated today. 
It is one of the conditions of economic progress. This normalization 
is based on technical research. But here, as everywhere else in a 
capitalist or semiliberal economy, the technical result is in conflict
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY15« )
with certain interests. In order to apply it, the good will of the pub­
lic cannot be counted on. It then becomes indispensable to sanction 
normalization in some other way. And only the state can apply this 
sanction. The result is the creation of arbitration commissions armed 
with public powers to deal with normalization.
Technical necessity calls for state intervention in order to organ­
ize the electric power network. Later on I shall discuss the inter­
relation of the network and the purely technical motives which 
prompt it. It is not the regulation of opposed interests, but the ne­
cessity of a higher organization embracing the local organizations, 
which, in this case, brings about the appeal to state power. The 
technical organism called a combine is of the same order. Whether 
it be the TVA or a Soviet Kombinat, it is perfectly illusory to claim 
that such combines represent autonomous organisms. In fact, the 
technical necessity which brought them into being gains force and 
value only through state intervention. Doubtless, when the organ­
ism is constituted, it may receive a certain independence from the 
state. But we must not forget who the real parent is. Nor must we 
overlook the fact that this parentage represents a profound inter­
vention in the economy on the part of the state, an intervention, 
moreover, not dictated by a theory or a will to power, but by the 
technical manifest.
The necessity of utilizing certain goods also tends in the same 
direction. It has long been recognized that technical progress is 
effected more rapidly in the creation of the means of production. 
From this fact comes a kind of hypertrophy of machine-producing 
industries. The well-known Hoover Committee for the elimination 
of waste found, for example, that the production of the American 
clothing industry was 45 per cent greater than necessary. The ca 
pacity ot the shoe industry was double its real production; and the 
printing industry was overequipped by 100 per cent. The excess 
production of home appliances and automobiles is well known. 
None of this overproduction would represent a waste, if one were 
judging on the basis of world needs. But, in the present situation, 
overproduction produces disequilibrium with respect to revenues, 
investment, and consumption possibilities, and so on. There is no 
absolute need to halt technical growth in any given area (say, in 
heavy industry). But there is a need to find markets for this over­
production. At present, only the state is in a position to sustain the
The Technological Society (15 7
tempo of technical progress in this direction, a heavy burden in­
deed.
Economics even intervenes in politics— consider the expansion 
of systematic “planning,” which proceeds by waves, so to speak. 
Here there is a transition from the microeconomy to the macro­
economy which it would be interesting to study in a detailed way. 
I shall simply point out that the application of planning on the 
scale of the enterprise leads to a nationwide application of planning 
in which all enterprises obey a like rule.
The establishment of production norms or of a plan becomes 
rational and technically necessary when the method is already ex­
tended to the national field. I could easily give additional examples; 
for instance, in the development of financial and banking tech­
niques. Let us bear in mind that atomic energy, say, when put to 
work will suppose state control of all sources of energy. It is incon­
ceivable that an individual could have at his disposal the sources 
of atomic power. Not doctrinal but technical reasons today render 
economic life inseparable from the state. This does not mean that 
the economy necessarily becomes collectivist or totalitarian. For the 
moment let us simply note the indissoluble relation.
This relation is admitted by many economists. Is it the result 
of chance or of choice? Of neither exclusively. Nor is it the result of 
a managed economy. As Robert Moss6 writes: “With the develop­
ment of the managed economy, it has become very difficult to trace 
a boundary between politics and economics . . . ” In reality, it is a 
necessity resulting from the advance of technique. Technique plays 
an important role in economic life; but it has the same effect with 
reference to economic science. A relation is being established be­
tween technical progress in economic life and technical progress 
in science or method. The two converge and end in identical 
results.
.  Before examining this transformation of method, we must briefly 
recall that political economy has changed its object, and almost its 
nature, as a consequence of the enormous accumulation of eco- 
mic facts. Economic facts have been rendered more numerous and 
more enormous— and this is not the least effect of technique in 
economic life. The definition of economic science has hence be­
come more and more complex and comprehensive. Without seek­
ing to note all the points of the curve, let two definitions suffice for
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY15® )
comparing the distance between the extremes. The first was given 
in 1850, the second in 1950. In the first, economic science was de­
fined as the “science of wealth.” Its object was primarily acquiring 
wealth and disposing of it. It was therefore an individual and pri­
vate matter. The objective of political economy is conceived in 
such a way today that it is virtually impossible to encompass it in a 
formula. As Marchal shows, we have the problem of satisfying the 
needs of humanity, co-ordinating the available means of produc­
tion, modifying existent institutions, and even transforming human 
needs. These problems must all be studied not on the plane of the 
individual but on the plane of the social group, and an effort made 
to disengage the laws of these social groups.
There is no need to go to the extreme and substitute for the or­
ganization of production the organization of distribution alone, as 
Robert Mosse appears to be doing when he writes: “From the mo­
ment production becomes sufficient, the essential thing is to dis­
tribute goods and leisure.” Without going that far, it is easy, as 
Lange has done, to see the difference between a science of the pro­
duction of wealth and a science of administration of scarce goods. 
More and more, the economic fact covers all human activity. Every­
thing has become function and object of the economy, and this has 
been effected by the intermediacy of technique. To the extent that 
technique has demanded complete devotion of man or brought to 
light a growing number of measurable facts, or rendered economic 
life richer and more complex, or enveloped the human being in a 
network of material possibilities that are being gradually realized, 
it has transformed the object of the economy. The economy now 
becomes obliged to take into account all human problems. The 
development of techniques is responsible for the staggering phe­
nomenon of the absorption by economics of all social activities.
The Secret Way
But another relation between technique and economy exists: the 
formation of an economic technique. Not only has economic science 
changed its object and its nature, but it has produced a technique 
which is simultaneously a method of knowledge and a method of
The Technological Society (159
action. Political economy has not renounced its claim to being 
normative. It seeks not only to grasp reality but also to modify it. 
But the real relation of these two aspects of economic technique 
is obvious. The method of scientific knowledge as such reacts on the 
economic milieu and tends to shape it; but this technique is not 
“neutral." It does not merely stand ready to do the bidding of any 
random doctrine or ideology. It behaves rather with its own 
specific weight and direction. It is not a mere instrument, but 
possesses its own force, which urges it into determined paths, some­
times contrary to human wishes.
Economists, not understanding this, want to disengage their 
technique from its “neutrality” and to bring it into the service of 
their ends. They reject the definition; “Economics is the science 
[technique!] of efficient choices.” But when they seek to humanize 
the economy, they learn quickly enough that such attempts lead 
directly to the subjugation of the ends to techniques. Those who 
pose the problem of ends and propose a humane economy as their 
goal are the very persons who develop techniques further and en­
hance their specific weights, as Jacques Aventur has shown. But 
whereas the overpowering phenomenon of the machine strikes 
home to everyone and makes plain its influence on economic life, 
the ways of economic technique are secret and everyone remains 
convinced of its innocuousness and docility.
In order to grasp the nature of economic technique, it is first of all 
necessary to grasp the reasons for its rise. One of its causes is so 
simple that I shall mention it only in passing. This is the evolution 
of the sciences in general.
The sciences in general, in the twentieth century, have passed 
through a crisis of growth characterized by the appearance of cer­
tain problems of methodology and technique. Economic science 
is likewise abandoning dogmatic positions and deductive methods 
in order to establish exact procedures. This may have taken place 
before the first gropings of the infant science had borne definitive 
results. Many economists believe that the ideal science, which must 
serve all others as model, is physics, and that economic method 
must approximate the method of physics taken as general type but 
not as specific means.
At the same time economists feel, as a kind of challenge, the in-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYl6o)
effectiveness of their system. Nothing has exposed the vanity of 
political economy better than their contradictory diagnoses and 
therapies for economic crises. For some the cause of crisis is an un­
saleable surplus of goods; for others, insufficiency of production. 
For some it is an excess of savings; for others, a lack of them. And 
as far as the proposed remedies are concerned, some economists 
would raise the discount rate and others would lower it. Some hold 
that wages must be stabilized and others demonstrate that they 
must be lowered. Such contradictions can only arise from a defect 
of method. And the economists bitterly resent the ironical attitude 
the public has toward them. One of them recently wrote: “The 
public believes in the physicist, but it has no confidence in the 
economist.” Policymakers absolutely cannot rely on what the econo­
mists say, nor follow their contradictory counsels with respect to 
action. All this, then, made it mandatory to replace the regime of 
theories, which gave birth to nothing but opinion, with a rigorous 
method which “sticks” to facts.
The need to stick to the facts became more imperative as the facts 
themselves became more complex. Here again the effect of tech­
niques made itself felt. The facts of economic life could be grasped 
directly when economic life was still relatively simple, when eco­
nomic phenomena (for example, at the end of the eighteenth cen­
tury) presented a picture which, in magnitudes and elements, was 
compatible with direct experience. But the enormous growth of the 
economic milieu has made direct apprehension impossible and 
brought about the decline of corresponding modes of reasoning. 
Everyday logic cannot embrace more than a very limited number 
of data. It was therefore necessary to invent a method correspond­
ing to the increasing complexity and amplitude of economic phe­
nomena. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a “technical 
state of mind” appeared which developed mightily toward mid­
century. This state of mind was characterized, first of all, by an 
effort to make a hard and fast separation between what is and 
what should be. The doctrinal character of economics was com­
pletely repudiated. The sole interest was in matters of fact. The 
goal was simply to know scientifically, to accumulate facts, to put 
them in mutual relation, and, if possible, to explain them by means 
of one another.
The Technological Society (161
Political economy is no longer a moral science in the traditional 
sense. It has become technique and has entered into a new ethical 
framework, which I shall define later on. This represents a de­
cisive step for the creation of a technique. The technical state of 
mind is likewise evident in the creation of a precise method (which 
more and more consists in the application of mathematics to eco­
nomics) and in the precise delimitation of a sphere of action. In 
effect, in order for technique to exist, method must be applied to a 
fixed order of phenomena. In the transition of doctrine to technique, 
the central idea was the distinction between microeconomics and 
macroeconomics, as in the work of Francois Perroux, a leader in 
this inquiry in France.
We have here a decisive situation. Microeconomics studies 
economic phenomena at the human level where the relatively hu­
mane traditional methods can be applied, where individual de­
cision is respected, but where the complete application of the tech­
nical apparatus is not permitted, either with respect to method or 
with respect to action. The observation of facts on the microeco­
nomic level does not ipso facto entail action, and to promote action 
is one of the principal characteristics of techniques. Even if 
microeconomic inquiry is useful and congenial, it nevertheless ap­
pears to have no future because it pertains to the limited world of 
the individual
Macroeconomics, on the other hand, opens all roads to technical 
research and application. Technical application presupposes, as we 
have already noted, measurable magnitudes, elimination of errors 
of judgment, and amplitudes of movement wide enough for tech­
nique to have an understandable object. These are precisely the 
characteristics of macroeconomic inquiry. There is no doubt that 
the methods of macroeconomics are still somewhat uncertain, and 
many phenomena are recalcitrant to it (for example, scientific tech­
niques applicable to revenues). Nevertheless, this is the domain a 
priori of technique and we can be assured, as a consequence, that 
this is where the really effective forces will be concentrated. We are 
likewise assured that microeconomics, far from being an element in 
the foundation of macroeconomics, or a complementary element to 
it, will be absorbed. It will lose its reason for existence to the extent 
that macroeconomics develops surer techniques. We are heading
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMtl 6 s )
toward a society in which knowledge of microeconomic phenomena 
will be the result of simple deduction from knowledge of macro- 
economic phenomena.
The technicians in these new disciplines all have one trait in 
common: the joy of constituting a closed group in which the lay­
man has no part at all. This represents an unconscious tendency; but 
we observe it among many modern economists in the form of a se­
cret technique, an esotericism, a certain contempt for whatever 
does not belong to its new world of means.
This “pride of youth" always appears among technicians when 
they are convinced that their new method is unassailable and that 
their discoveries are becoming the center of things. The authority 
in which they clothe themselves takes the form of a secret vocabu­
lary which is incomprehensible to the outsider even when it is em­
ployed, as often happens, to enunciate the most obvious facts. 
Technique always creates a kind of secret society, a closed frater­
nity of its practitioners. It is a new thing in the milieu of economics 
to note a kind of studied incommunicability. Up to now, every man 
with a little education was able to follow the works and theories of 
the economists. To be able to follow them today, one would have to 
be both a specialist and a technician. The technique itself is difficult 
and the necessary instruments cannot be managed without previ­
ous education. And there is that caprice of many economists to 
constitute themselves a closed society. These two factors coincide, 
indicating the grave consequence of excluding the public from the 
technical life. Yet it can scarcely be otherwise.
Technique as a general phenomenon (as we shall see when we 
study the political milieu) always gives rise to an aristocracy of 
technicians who guard secrets to which no outsider has access. De­
cisions which have a serious basis take on the appearance of arbi­
trary and incomprehensible decrees. A cleavage like this, which is 
inevitable in the advance of technique, is decisive for the future of 
the democracies. Economic life, not in its content but in its direc­
tion, will henceforth entirely elude popular control. No democracy 
is possible in the face of a perfected economic technique. The de­
cisions of the voters, and even of the elected, are oversimplified, in­
coherent, and technically inadmissible. It is a grave illusion to be­
lieve that democratic control or decision-making can be reconciled 
with economic technique. Little by little the elements necessary to
The Technological Society (163
the creation of this technique are taking shape; and soon they will 
be perfected.
The Economic Techniques of Observation. I do not intend to 
describe these instrumentalities; I am concerned here solely with 
exhibiting them as an ensemble.
The principal instruments which have been developed are: statis­
tics, accounting procedures, the application of mathematics to eco­
nomics, the method of models, and techniques of research into 
public opinion. It is evident that these elements reciprocally con­
dition one another.
At the base of the structure lies statistics, the instrumentality for 
determining the raw facts of economics. At one time statistical data 
were ridiculed on the ground that they were misleading. But this 
stage lies behind us, and nowadays a large measure of confidence 
rests in the precision of such data. This change has resulted, in part, 
from a change in the state of mind of the statisticians themselves. 
They are immersed in a “statistical atmosphere” and comply with 
the quantitative and numerical practices of the modem world. To 
statisticians, statistics is no longer a mere game; it is an essential 
operation of society. This represents a change not only in perspec­
tive and in seriousness, but also in basic position. For a long time 
statistics was the work of amateurs; today it is a complex organiza­
tion of specialists. It has become a profession and, as a conse­
quence, is practiced much more earnestly. Moreover, the statisti­
cians have at their disposal increasingly precise instruments. Among 
these instruments (which have transformed administrative as well 
as statistical technique) are the calculating machine, the punched- 
card machine, and microfilm. Not only has the speed of operation 
been prodigiously accelerated, but also its precision and its dimen­
sions. By means of microfilm, hitherto uncombinable elements can 
be combined; and by means of the electronic brain, operations can 
be effected which the human brain could never perform.
The statistician is, materially speaking, in a position to perform 
convincingly. This is even more evident in the utilization of statisti­
cal data. As we shall see, the combination of the elements is essen­
tial, and this combination becomes feasible largely through the 
intermediacy of the machine.
A final element increases the professional seriousness of the statis­
ticians: their responsibility. In democratic countries, it lies in the
164 )  TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY
realm of private enterprise; the various organs concerned with sta­
tistical data in effect sell their studies to the great corporations 
which must know precisely, for example, the course of a market. If 
the information proves inexact, the statistician can be sued in 
civil court, at least in the United States. In countries under authori­
tarian rule, responsibility is a public matter; in the Soviet Union the 
statistician who gives false information is regarded as a saboteur.
These elements together make modern statistical data more and 
more precise. The great scope of statistical operations and of the 
organs involved generally escapes the nonspecialist. To give a sin­
gle example, there are in the United States fifty-six federal agencies, 
each of which specializes in one or several statistical categories. Al­
together, twelve categories of weekly statistics are published. One 
of these, the category of price, takes in four elements. One of these 
(gross price) comprehends 1,690 weekly quotations combined 
in 890 series. This indicates the extreme complexity of the opera­
tion. It must become even more complex when interpretation is 
undertaken.
All this work is not motivated by pure scientific interest. It is 
oriented toward action. Permanent inquiry of this sort is no longer 
instituted to construct or support doctrines but rather to relate in­
formation to action. In order to succeed in effecting this connection, 
interpretation is necessary, and this is the principal task of the tech­
nical discipline called econometrics.
Econometrics is distinct from mathematical economics. It is much 
more theoretical. Its principal operations on statistical data are two­
fold: (1) analysis, comprising operations such as simplification or 
dissociation of statistical data; and (a) comparison, which can be 
applied to different kinds of elements. Magnitudes can be com­
pared by establishing what are called equations of regression, 
which express a constant relation between two magnitudes of the 
economic domain. Variations can also be compared; here a correla­
tion index is established, according to which two economic phe­
nomena vary in direct or in inverse proportion but with the same 
velocity. Within the same realm, the econometrician tries to estab­
lish certain relations: no fact in the economic domain can be re­
garded as due to chance; and not satisfied with simply noting and 
giving the correlation formula, the econometrician goes further and
The Technological Society (165
establishes the causal relation between two phenomena, a proce­
dure which leads into the future.
Until recently, economists operated on concrete data alone. But, 
for the purposes of action, they must make predictions. A distinction 
must be drawn between predictions which are made according to 
the system of covariations, and causal explanations of phenomena. 
Here the economist leaves the purely technical realm. An equation 
no longer provides the solution; there is a certain subjectivity, a cer­
tain personal judgment. To be sure, it is present in the various 
other operations, but to a lesser degree.
Economic technique has taken over a variety of other means; for 
example, stochastics, the application of the calculus of probabilities 
to economic phenomena. This technique is extraordinarily difficult 
to handle. It does not operate on raw figures but on statistical data, 
on data furnished by econometrics (as, for example, the coefficients 
of elasticity), and on the data furnished by public-opinion research 
institutes. In connection with the third element, it is evident that 
economic phenomena are not mechanical; opinion plays a role. In 
a very simplified way, it might be said that stochastics seeks to es­
tablish a law of probability, or of the frequency, of a given event, 
starting with a very large number of observations. Stochastics, 
therefore, represents an instrument of prediction which gives the 
direction of the most probable evolution of the situation.
This stochastic calculus is limited only by the nature of the eco­
nomic and social milieu. For example, if a given law is exact, the 
public which is informed of it tends to react in the inverse sense. 
But sometimes it reacts by conforming to the law. The act of predic­
tion is thus in a sense self-falsifying. But the public, by so reacting, 
falls under the influence of a new prediction which is completely 
determinable. The economist is able to establish laws of probability 
for all deviations of opinion. It must be assumed, however, that 
one remains in the framework of rational behavior. The system 
works all the better when it deals with men who are better inte­
grated into the mass, men whose consciousness is partially para­
lyzed, who lend themselves willingly to statistical observations and 
systematization. The results obtained by this technique are impres­
sive, even though tlie technique is still immature.
Much more classical, and of a different order, is the whole com-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY166)
plex of accounting techniques. These techniques have been much 
modified and no longer belong merely to the realm of enterprise 
but rather to that of economics. The accountant is no longer a mere 
agent for registering the movement of funds in an enterprise. Ac­
cording to the Lutfalla report published by the Conseil ficonomique, 
1948, he has become a veritable “profits engineer.” His operations 
encompass not only money but all the elements of production. He 
is oriented toward the past and also toward the future. The more 
complex manufacturing operations become, the more necessary it 
is to take adequate precautions and to use foresight. It is not possi­
ble to launch modem industrial processes lightly. They involve too 
much capital, labor, and social and political modifications. De­
tailed forecasting is necessary. We shall meet this question again 
when we discuss planning, but it is appropriate here to call atten­
tion to the so-called “input-output” techniques Leontieff has 
pointed out. These represent a method designed to establish in a 
precise, numerical way the interconnections among all sectors of 
production techniques. They determine for each sector what is 
bought from and sold to the others. This method makes it possible 
to establish in detail what raw materials, instruments, tools, and 
machines are required to produce a given product. Under present 
conditions, one can no longer fix magnitudes approximately or be 
content with mastering certain key subjects. For even a very ordi­
nary commodity, two or three hundred basic elements must be 
taken into account. Exact quantities, weights, and times must be 
fixed. The necessary calculations can only be performed with the 
help of computing machines. With this method the well-known and 
hackneyed formula— that everything is reciprocally dependent—  
becomes a rigorous reality. But it is the technical elements which 
are reciprocally dependent, welded together by a common neces­
sity and expressed in certain new techniques.
What holds for the private accountant is even more true for the 
public accountant who works on a nationwide scale. There are 
certain differences between the two insofar as enterprise has pri­
vate profit as its end. As a consequence of the profit motive, the pri­
vate accountant must comply with the rules of capitalist manage­
ment. The public accountant (who becomes an accountant of 
initiative) draws up balance sheets and future revenue potentials 
for a complex organism whose reactions are slow and of great am-
The TechnobgicalSociety (167
plitude when referred to the impulses at their origin. If public en­
terprise behaves in any way like capitalist enterprise, its internal 
dynamism complies with certain laws. The role of the accountant 
is to discover these laws. The eif ects of this new revenue-calculating 
economic technique, which relates economic effects to their causes, 
are easily seen in fields such as the liquor industry, housing, trans­
portation, and so on. It is clear that this calculated revenue poten­
tial bears not merely on money but also on human capital. France 
does not yet have a central accounting service which could com­
pletely exploit this technique and establish a measurement of social 
needs, means of production, movement of capital, national income, 
and demographic change, etc.
Returning to the methods of pure economic technique, we find 
the metl^od of models. It is extremely difficult to experiment in eco­
nomic matters. But experimentation is indispensable in all sciences 
and even more so in techniques. As Vincent puts it, a model is a 
“simplified but complete representation in its numerical aspect of 
the economic evolution of a society; for example, a nation during a 
given period.” A model is a reproduction in miniature of a certain 
economic ensemble in the form of mathematical equations. It is im­
possible, obviously, to put all economic phenomena into a model; a 
certain arbitrariness is called for. The primary act is therefore a 
choice, founded on some theoretical decision, of the constants and 
variables to be put into the model. This theoretical decision, how­
ever, is not arbitrary. It is guided by certain principles, in particular 
the necessity of linking observation to action. Once the constants 
and the variables of the system have been selected (and they may 
be numerous), the relations between them are established. Some 
of these relations are evident in the sense that they are purely 
quantitative; others are more unstable and subjective and must be 
established by the economic technician himself. They are empirical 
relations, verified or proven false by experiment Finally, the en­
semble of these relations must be put in the form of equations by 
insertion of the time factor. Then, by solving the equations, it 
is possible to study the evolution of the system and its incidences. 
This facilitates the study of the evolution of certain mechanisms 
determined by a social group, or of the incidence of some ex­
terior intervention into an economic system, or of the influence 
and importance to the whole of every element in an ensemble.
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY168)
Models can be purely theoretical or historical, as when the data 
arise from statistics (in which case they must be tested against 
the actual evolution of society). Or they can be predictive, as when 
the attempt is made to forecast the future. These predictive models 
are the object of great interest in the study of economic complexes.
The last of these new economic techniques which I wish to de­
scribe in this brief review is public-opinion analysis. Everyone is ac­
quainted with the Callup Institute, which has branches in almost 
every country of the world. Various systems (soundings, sam­
plings, inquiries) are used to establish periodically the feelings of a 
given class or category of the population; about any important 
question. Certainly, there is strong skepticism about these methods. 
No one believes that he thinks and acts like his neighbor. No one is 
sympathetic to the notion that he is a mere number in some list or 
series; and this unconscious rejection makes for skepticism. None­
theless, the results of such samplings must be deemed valid, in 
spite of the seeming (but easily explainable) setbacks they suffer, 
as, for example, in the well-known case of the American presiden­
tial elections of 1948. The results reflect various phenomena: soci­
ological currents, ethical preferences, and political opinions with 
which we here are not concerned. But other results reflect eco­
nomic currents: opinions concerning prices and wages, commer­
cial choices, urgent economic needs (to the extent that they are 
measurable), and so on. In sum, anything in the nature of an opin­
ion which can be grasped by a good observer or reporter will hence­
forth be numerically measured and followed scientifically during 
all stages of its development. This method represents a great revo­
lution; it permits the integration of opinion in the technical world 
in general and in economic technique in particular. This system 
brings into the statistical realm measures of things hitherto unmeas­
urable. It effects a separation of what is measurable from what is 
not. Whatever cannot be expressed numerically is to be eliminated 
from the ensemble, either because it eludes numeration or because 
it is quantitatively negligible. We have, therefore, a procedure for 
the elimination of aberrant opinions which is essential to the 
understanding of the development of this technique. The elimi­
nation does not originate in the technique itself. But the investi­
gators who utilize its results are led to it of necessity. No activity 
can embrace the whole complexity of reality except as a given
The Technological Society (169
method permits. For this reason, this elimination procedure is 
found whenever the results of opinion probings are employed in 
political economy.
The economist is thus provided with an arsenal of technical 
means which enable him to observe and sometimes to predict eco­
nomic reality in detail. Then the following question is unavoidable: 
Will these techniques remain simple techniques of observation, of 
pure knowledge? We grant that their creators had no ulterior mo­
tives. The means are there simply to be of assistance to economic 
science. But will this motive be adhered to? Let us consider the 
position of the economist as J. U. Nef has described it. The econo­
mist, more or less stricken with an inferiority complex in regard to 
the public, “abandoning the hope of affecting policy by objective 
thinking, seeks refuge by becoming an expert and counselor on 
questions of technology or practical politics.” Economists cherish 
the hope of influencing reality. The technique of knowledge the 
economist is now acquiring allows him, through the state, to exer­
cise this influence. We note this in all countries, no matter what 
their type of economy or form of government. It has been called the 
reign of the experts, but it is in actual fact the reign of the techni­
cians. Economists today have the means of being technicians near 
the seat of state power. But even without wishing to take account 
of this tendency, we know that these means of observation of reality 
will not remain inert. Like all techniques, they possess specific 
weights and direction. The reasons are very simple.
An organization for establishing statistical data is extremely 
costly and cannot continue without profits. One way of making 
a profit is to sell statistical products to a capitalist clientele, which 
will utilize them to guide its business into certain channels. A  
statistical bureau then becomes a counseling bureau. But the 
use of statistical data in a semiliberal capitalist economy is re­
stricted and cannot be developed to its full effectiveness. This 
incapacity of capitalism correctly to employ techniques appears 
time and again. Mumford says: "One of the most flagrant faults of 
capitalism is not to have known how to make use of existing lab­
oratories, for example, the Bureau of Standards, to determine 
norms from which the whole body of consumers would have bene­
fited.” The tendency of technological society is to determine the 
movements of the macroeconomy; yet it is striking to note that sta-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY170 )
tistics, once established, tend to revert to the level of the micro- 
economy and individual decision, and to find employment only on 
this level. This is obviously insufficient; the economists are in a 
position to lay claim to something better than a clientele which, 
in any case, seldom enables them to cover their costs. They must 
address themselves to the state. Certain semipublic corporations 
finance the operations, but it is clear that the state demands its 
quid pro quo. If the state is to pay for statistical research, it must 
get something in return; assistance in directing national affairs. 
The state requires the economist, on the basis of statistics, to seek 
out methods of intervention either directly or by subtle means 
such as those advocated by John Maynard Keynes. When the 
great private corporations or the state ask the economist for a 
method to influence reality, they are addressing the economist’s 
own invincible longing, which in the beginning engendered the 
improvement of these scientific means. Suppose that we have ac­
cumulated enormous quantities of facts, have encompassed the 
whole of reality, and possess the means to follow the mechanism of 
economic phenomena and even to a certain degree to predict them. 
Shall this accumulated force, then, serve no purpose? The 195* 
report of the American Bureau of Labor Statistics shows clearly 
that this ensemble of means leads inevitably to planning.
We confess that we are unable to follow Closon’s reasoning 
when he declares that the operations of the Compabilite Nationale 
are not a threat to freedom because, in fact, they are not applied. 
Once the trends of the economy have been recognized and re­
duced to numerical form, will it be tolerated that no intervention 
be undertaken when the catastrophic consequences of some de­
cision or other have been clearly perceived?
On a more modest but still significant plane, what meaning has a 
detailed accounting of all the needs of a thoughtless worker (in­
cluding the number of springs in his mattress and the number of 
razor blades he uses annually), undertaken in order to establish a 
minimum wage, if he can spend his money haphazardly? Mere pre­
diction would plainly be absurd. The irrationality of the individual 
keeps him from living on the amount he could live on according to 
calculations. He would die of hunger on a subsistence minimum, 
unless an authoritarian education made him conform.
Let us grant that this represents no more than a temptation to
The Technological Society ( 1 71
the economist. But it would require superhuman strength not to 
yield to this temptation once action becomes possible; the more so 
because the informational techniques described are closely con­
nected to techniques of action, as are the establishment of norms or 
of accounting plans. We have distinguished somewhat arbitrarily 
between knowledge and action in order to present in the most ob­
jective way possible the normal development of economics pro­
duced by the creation of these techniques. Even when they serve 
solely for the purposes of knowledge, it is clear by how many routes 
they, end in intervention. Econometrics is only to be understood if 
it issues in its normal end, the establishment of economic plan­
ning. Without this, econometrics is inefficient, and efficiency is the 
very law of technique. Like a horse chafing at the bit, the tech­
niques of economic science await the signal to intervene more com­
pletely than ever before in the reality they have come to under­
stand.
The Economic Techniques of Action. At the same time that the 
economist has created a technique for knowing, he has created a 
technique for acting. A new world is awakening, an economic mu­
tation is being effected. Among these techniques of intervention we 
shall consider only two: plan and norms.
The establishment of norms by the economist has become neces­
sary, Dieterlen tells us, simply in order to follow and understand 
economic development (A good example of the transition from 
techniques of understanding to techniques of action.) It is not 
sufficient merely to follow the course of statistical data. It is neces­
sary to erect in advance a system of norms of progression of the 
elements of a given economic system which will permit us at any 
moment to estimate the divergence of a given element of the sys­
tem from the norm. Even in a nondirected economy, it is possible 
to determine (a) a certain relation among the different economic 
components; (b ) a “normal” tendency for the evolution of each of 
these elements; and, consequently, (c) a “normal” evolution of 
their relation. When such a scheme has been established, it is then 
possible to say whether one of the elements is progressing too rap­
idly or too slowly, a fact which, in Dieterlens opinion, should 
serve to reveal the causes of an economic crisis.
But if we thus establish certain norms of progression, we are con­
fronted with two facts. First, the necessity of intervention: once
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMT27* )
the norm has been set and a condition which diverges from k has 
been observed, it would be folly to permit a dangerously abnormal 
phenomenon to develop. Second, the possibility of extending such 
an establishment of norms. Why should inquiry be limited to a 
given system? Once a calculus of norms is possible, it ought to be 
extended throughout the economy. This legislative tendency 
will operate not merely in the area of the organization of labor. A 
bureau for setting standards, or a service of industrial analysis, is no 
longer limited to the co-ordination, say, of wages and of the scien­
tific organization of labor. These operations transcend the level of 
private enterprise and attain the level of the general. They har­
monize the complementary activities of wide economic sectors. We 
are then completely within the technique of intervention; the tran­
sition from the one to the other has been imperceptible.
If the term norm is taken in its exact meaning, it is evident that 
the application of the system of norms orients us in a unique direc­
tion. Under capitalism, norms are fundamental to the planning of 
enterprise, but the tempo of production remains a function of mar­
ket conditions. In a planned economy, norms are fundamental to 
all economic calculations. They determine the quantities to be pro­
duced and measure the degree to which the plan is realized in the 
market (Fedotov). The technique of normalization can only have 
full scope in a planned economy. It tends, in proportion to its devel­
opment, to imply a planned economy, simply because it tends to 
pass from private planning and an atomized economy to a global 
economy and general planning (the fundamental condition of its 
application). A  global economy is more exact to the degree that 
both these aspects of planning are subject to the law and control of 
the machine, as Mas indicates.
All this represents a tendency rather than an accomplished fact 
As soon as industrial normalization intervenes, it brings with it 
this tendency which inevitably devalues the older economic types 
and the older industrial organizations.
Norms mutually entail each other and presuppose certain syn­
chronizations. It is almost impossible to conceive of localized 
norms. If it is asked what the motive force behind this tendency is, 
once again we must answer: efficiency. The logic of norms was 
clearly evident in the application in Britain in 1940 of the National 
Research Project. Research on the measure of production and its
The Technological Society l 1 73
practical consequences spread like a slick of oil and brought the 
whole of industry into line. It has been praised as "political econ­
omy entering into action."
This "chain reaction" is also only a tendency at the moment It is 
claimed that counteracting factors, economic and human, will pre­
vent it from becoming a reality. But these other factors are not tech­
nical. The competition is between divergent forces, the one techni­
cal, the others not And in our society the technical factor must pre­
vail over the others. I therefore believe that in this area, too, the 
logic of norms will impose itself everywhere. And if in my analysis 
of this development I seem to have isolated the technical factor, 
this is not because I choose to neglect or fail to recognize the others. 
But, as I have already demonstrated, the technical factor is at pres­
ent the decisive one. In addition, most of the other developmental 
factors are well known and almost universally studied, whereas 
the technical factor remains, in general, obscure.
As soon as norms become essential because of their obvious util­
ity, they appear to complement the plan. There is no better means 
of co-ordinating them or permitting them their full efficiency than 
to integrate them into a plan. This is what I mean by the logic of 
norms.
Another technique of intervention which has recently become 
essential (and which I shall only mention) is so-called operational 
research. Its basic characteristics, its objectives, and its meaning are 
identical with those of norms. But the problem here is a problem of 
decision. Norms and operational research are today the two means 
by which the plan is executed.
Planning represents a second aspect of the economic technique 
of intervention. Everyone has an approximate idea of what plan­
ning means: the state decides everything and regulates everything 
in advance. We must analyze at least the characteristics of the plan­
ning operation, if not its details. Economic planning is a variety of 
technique, not a form or a system or an economic theory. Not a 
single economy of any type whatsoever has been constructed by 
means of planning. We think otherwise because the Russian ad­
venture has always appeared to us in such a guise. “It was desired 
to build an economy of the collective type and to succeed in this a 
plan was elaborated." But the Russian plan assumed its own mean-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY174)
ing independently of all theoretical ideas. In reality, the plan is a 
technique and ipso facto indifferent to doctrines and opinions; it is 
least of all concerned with principles of action. In Germany no one 
had any very clear concept of the economic form that should be 
adopted, but planning was accepted as an efficient means. In our 
own day, it is even more true that plans develop in all countries 
without any foundation of economic doctrine. This, in one sense, is 
very reassuring. People constantly say: “If we remain true to our 
old doctrine and the plan is only an instrument, we remain what 
we were. If planning has sometimes functioned as a socialist in­
strument, it was only because it was in the service of socialist doc­
trines.” This is, as consolation, illusory. But it is at least founded on 
the truth that planning is not connected with any particular doc­
trine. System or not, however, it perhaps implies a certain definite 
form of economy.
A second observation leads us to insist on the importance of 
“ways and means” in the establishment of the plan. The plan is not 
merely a set of commands or some general orientation. There are 
two focuses in the plan. There is the choice of objectives, the direc­
tion to give to an economic system in its ensemble. There is also the 
most concrete possible anticipation of the means needed to reach 
these objectives. Economic choice of objectives and the establish­
ment of corresponding means— such is die plan. But this choice and 
these means are elaborated in the most rational possible way, and a 
whole complex of techniques of application enables the user to 
avoid arbitrariness. With regard to the techniques of the forma­
tion of a plan, we refer the reader to the works of Charles Bettel- 
heim.
Now let us consider a great difficulty which is an important point 
of discussion in modem planning: prices and wages. Until now, the 
plan has been more or less tied to “real” prices and wages. Plan­
ning, if not actually established by the market, was at least fixed in 
temporal or spatial relation to market prices and wages. But this 
situation could not last long. The intention of the third Soviet 
plan was precisely to fix prices and wages in a purely abstract, but 
not arbitrary, way by certain econometric methods, independently 
of the laws of the market. It would seem from the various wage 
manipulations which took place in 1949, and the repudiation of 
Vosnessenski, that this attempt was not a success. However, we
The Technological Society ( 1 7 5
must consider it as the only logical way in which planning could 
then have been undertaken. And this approach may vesy well be 
eliminated by new improvements in economic technique. This 
would set to rest the objections of Francis Perroux, for whom the 
plan was thereby deprived of all "economic rationality.”
A plan is executed in accordance with two constant principles: 
efficiency and social need. The plan first answers the constant 
search for the most efficient use of mechanical means, natural 
riches, and disposable forces. The problem is to organize, co-ordi­
nate, and normalize these elements in such a way that each instru­
ment produces its'maximum yield. Planning has been criticized on 
all fronts, from the philosophic to the economic. But no one has yet 
questioned the fundamental efficiency of planning, except at the 
beginning. This criticism had its origin in two things, the gropings 
of the planners and the ignorance of the critics. Everyone has since 
become convinced that the mechanism is efficient— with allowances 
for a certain bluff that up to now has accompanied planning experi­
ments. As far as technique is concerned, judgment is based solely 
on efficiency, and planning appears fully justified in this respect.
The second of the two principal criteria of planning is the satis­
faction of social needs. The initial difficulty is to determine just 
what these needs are at a given moment How shall we effect the 
balance between social needs and production? Theoretically these 
are insoluble questions (I say theoretically advisedly). The pro­
posed means (opinion polls, ration cards, obligatory absorption by 
the buyer of whatever is produced) indicate that the question as it 
is usually posed is abstract If one says: “In planning, the consumer 
is in command,” one is making abstraction from the fact that the 
plan, a sociological phenomenon, answers to social need and not to 
individual need. At the same time one is thinking of an abstract 
man (a kind of fixed image of man), and this, too, renders the pro­
posed question inoperative. The social man envisaged by the plan 
is a man integrated more and more into modem technical society. 
His needs are more and more collectivized, not indeed by direct 
pressure, but by publicity, standardization of goods, intellectual 
uniformity, and so on. It is well-known that “to the standardization 
of production corresponds a standardization of taste which gives to 
social life its collective character.” Moreover, mass consumption 
corresponds spontaneously to mass production. There is no need
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY176)
for repressive measures. The adaptation of the public occurs of it­
self. The average man becomes the norm in the most liberal system 
in the world because only the products necessary to the average 
man are offered on the market. In fact, the problem of understand­
ing social needs is complicated only if planning technique is sepa­
rated from all the other techniques. These other techniques spon­
taneously lead men to feel certain social needs conformable to 
certain data. When the plan is reinserted into its true framework, it 
is evident that there is no need of forcing social needs. They are 
prepared in advance, so that the plan is in a position to correspond 
exactly to them, after a more or less difficult period of adaption.
The whole evolution of human needs, in their “sociologism,” 
tends toward the plan. There is almost no necessity any longer to 
exert pressure on these needs. They are already what they should 
be, provided that we abandon human misfits to their miserable lot, 
a procedure which is, in any case, the course of all techniques. 
When it is a question of dominating the world, one cannot stop to 
consider Kirgiz shepherds or Bantu huntsmen who will not accept 
the-kws of the determining forces.
Planning does not pretend to produce an immediate response to 
all social needs. As I have said, there is choice. It is choice which 
can render certain persons unhappy but not hopeless, because the 
plan is inserted into a dynamic conception of the economy. The 
-  equilibrium between production and consumption is neither static 
nor does it exist at present It is to come, and will constantly re­
new itself. The choice effected at a given moment is placed in a 
general perspective which makes this choice relative, and at the 
same time subordinate, to subsequent foreseeable development It 
is necessary therefore to consider both the future of realization 
and the mechanism of unitomnization of needs (which I have al­
ready mentioned). This leads the two lines to come together con­
stantly. This is an element of the dialectical view of the eeenomy, 
which is the only one admissible today. During the realization of a 
plan, a constant readaptation of means and ends is simultaneously 
effected, assuring a greater cohesion of the ensemble, if not a 
greater certainty of realization.
Finally, it seems to me important, in connection with the plan 
itself, to emphasize the need for utilizing the labor force efficiently. 
It would appear that full employment is an internal necessity, not
The Technological Society (177
merely a momentary circumstance, of the plan. Charles Bettelheim 
has demonstrated that without full employment there is no possi­
ble satisfaction of the totality of social needs. In this connection, 
wages change their character and become a part of the social 
product The plan ought, therefore, to provide for both full employ­
ment and the assignment of the labor force in accordance with the 
requirements of the production plan. It becomes indispensable to 
extend the plan to the whole labor force. Without this, the mecha­
nism cannot function. And this then poses the question of the 
place, of the limitation, of the characteristics of planning.
One need not yield to the puerile enthusiasm that considers plan­
ning a panacea, a polyvalent remedy like penicillin. But it is nec­
essary to put the plan into a different perspective. Whatever the 
remedies or proposed reforms for resolving injustice and incoher­
ence in the modern economy, everything occurs through the agency 
of the plan. The plan in itself is no solution. But it is the indispensa­
ble instrument of all solutions. Even if one starts with Knut Wicksell 
or John Maynard Keynes, one meets again and again the urgency 
of planning.
In Mumford’s proposals to release man from the clutches of tech­
nique, there is an interesting project for an economic regionalism 
on a world-wide plane. But this regionalism can, in fact, only be 
based on the exceedingly complete and rigid planning of produc­
tion and distribution.
Planning and Liberty. Everybody, or almost everybody, is con­
vinced today of the effectiveness of the two techniques of interven­
tion, norm and plan. And, in fact, in view of the challenges which 
not only nations but political and social systems hurl at one another, 
and even more, in view of the challenge that man is making to 
misery, distress, and hunger, it is difficult to see how the use of the 
means provided by planning could be avoided. In the complexity 
of economic phenomena arising from techniques, how could one 
justify refusal to employ a trenchant weapon that simplifies and re­
solves all contradictions, orders incoherences, and rationalizes the 
excesses of production and consumption? And since the techniques 
of economic observation, if they are to have their full scope, issue 
directly in the technique of planning, and since there can be no 
question of renouncing the youthful vigor of these mathematical 
methods, how is it possible not to see them through to the end?
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYI ? 8 )
Yet a certain disquiet has appeared among those who cherish 
human freedom and democracy. They ask if planning is not an all- 
consuming force. They seek to set three kinds of limits to its power, 
represented by: (a) flexible planning, (b) the system of limited 
planning, and (c) the separation of the planning agency from the 
state (in short, what is usually called the reconciliation of liberty 
and socialism). No one accepts Friedrich August von Hayek’s 
proposition (in his Road to Serfdom) that planning is essentially 
evil. Conscientious economists are unable to renounce technical 
discovery. They seek a middle term.1  Is it to be a limited plan? But
1  See a com pendium  of ideological illusions concerning planning and liberty con* 
tained in a recent special num ber devoted to this question in the Indian Journal of Political Science. Ten or so articles attem pt to dem onstrate that planning is indeed 
indispensable but that it presents no danger at all to freedom. A complete unreality 
characterizes these articles. The position of the authors can be sum m arized as 
follows.
First, they express the hope of saving freedom  through liberal and partial plan* 
ning. (However, other authors in the sam e volume show that this hope is absurd 
anu ineffective.)  Second, the articles contain other form ulas, equally absurd and 
w ithout content. “Planning should have as its object the realization of freedom '*; 
“The m ore rational planning becomes, the greater the freedom  of toe people.” These 
are m ere affirm ations, and one would seek in vain for corresponding realities or for 
a possible content
Som e of these authors rely for proof of their propositions on a series of sim ple 
syllogism s. For example; “(a) Planning increases production, (a) Production allows 
the satisfaction of m ore needs. (3) The satisfaction of needs is the condition of 
freedom . Hence, planning is the condition of freedom.” This reasoning is faulty for 
two reasons. It is linear and takes no account of the complexity of the facts (for 
exam ple, put a m an in prison, give him  everything he needs; he is nonetheless 
free). It derives its conclusion partly from  an economic premise (the first) and 
partly from an ethical prem ise (the third), without attempting to distinguish the 
logical planes on which these prem ises lie. The third prem ise is, in any case, wholly 
questionable from  a spiritual or ethical point of view. (I shall return later to a 
discussion of this.)
But for these authors the principal hope of saving freedom , in  this amazing theory, 
Ups to the claim  that an enlightened public opinion has the oower to direct the 
decision of the planners toward the satisfaction of its real needs. In this case, one 
would indeed have dem ocratic planning, collectivism on a voluntary base. But to 
reason like this is surely to move in  a world of dream s. The good faith of these 
intellectuals com pels one to think seriously of pathology.
Can anyone really believe that, if public opinion wanted pastry shops, planning 
could be oriented toward these institutions, if, in addition, the other uses of flour 
had to be sacrificed? Can anyone really believe that public opinion would receive 
any satisfaction if it demanded footgear when tractors were needed? Such beliefs 
are sim ple nonsense. It will be maintained that public opinion does not really know  
what it needs . . . But then the technician m akes the decision. We are fam iliar 
enough with the m echanism: first producer goods, then consum er goods. Of course, 
public opinion will be "consulted" after the technician has made his decision: “You 
would have preferred woolen goods? Technically im possible; we had to m ake them  
of cotton. Green? Unfortunately, there is no aniline. But you can choose between
The Technological Society (179
then the problem is posed: where lies the limit? For some econo­
mists, planning is a purely economic question bearing on key in­
dustries. But the debate has lasted a century and no decision has 
been reached as to which industries are key industries. The deci­
sion becomes even more difficult as categories change with time 
(the extraction of uranium, for example, was not a key industry 
twenty years ago) and as the interpenetration of economic activi­
ties becomes greater and greater. It is becoming extremely diffi­
cult to analyze the factors involved in production. Every part of the 
system is, directly or indirectly, dependent on all the others through 
financial repercussions or through the structure of labor. How, 
then, is it possible to set up a planned sector of the economy along­
side an unplanned sector? When one rereads what was published 
on this problem only ten years ago, it is clear that these studies 
are completely out of date and have been rendered null and void 
by subsequent technical improvements. Let us assume that a plan 
has been made for a five-year period. If now the attempt is made 
to limit it to economics by allowing the greatest possible freedom 
outside this area (for example, by having no planning in the social 
domain), how can this economic plan possibly be viable?
The problem of financing is necessarily raised even by a flexible 
and limited plan. It was clear, at the time of the discussion of the 
new phase of the Monnet plan (September, 1950), that bank credit, 
the appeal to private financing, was insufficient. It was necessary 
to turn to public financing. But this represented an enormous un­
dertaking, even for the state. The state was obliged to concern it­
self with the planning of its finances according to the more or less
light red and dark red. See what freedom you havef* In effect, these authors 
seek to baptize obedience to technical necessity with the name freedom. They 
attempt to hide the real com pulsions and write either out of blindness or hypocrisy.
Only one of these articles is valid. Suda declares: “So much the worse for freedom. 
We can sacrifice it. In any case, on the plane of values, dedication to the common 
good is a higher idea) than freedom.** I cannot agree with this, but at least it allows 
us honestly to assess our situation. We encounter the same attempt at justification 
(In general, better supported but as unconvincing) in Entre la planification et la 
liberty, in which Dutch, French, Norwegian, and American authors study the prob­
lem from very varied viewpoints (Revue Economique, March, 1953).
These illusions are contradicted by Tibor Mende himself (India After 12 years, 
1959). He shows that Indian agricultural planning (the communal projects of die 
villages) collapsed because it was not comprehensive and authoritarian. His com- 
arison of India with China is a clear demonstration that, in accordance with the 
criteria of yield and efficiency (the sole justified criteria of any planning), the most 
authoritarian methods are the most profitable.
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYl8o)
new totalitarian financial conception, which assumes control of the 
whole national revenue and affects every citizen.
In order for the plan to be realized, the use of the labor force 
must also be integrated into it  This is recognized by Great Britain, 
for example, in its eonception of full employment The application 
of the plan likewise presupposes planning of housing and of voca­
tional guidance, apprenticeships, and schools. Moreover, it quickly 
becomes clear that there is a need too for social security ( a neces­
sary psychological and sociological element if full employment is 
to function without too violent a shock to human nature). This in­
terrelation is not imaginary and gratuitous. Internal necessity con­
nects the elements of the plan, and it is folly to think of breaking its 
links.
Thus the plan, once adopted as method, tends perpetually to 
extend to new domains. To limit it would be to put the method in 
a position in which it cannot function— exactly as though one were 
to construct efficient automobiles but refuse to build adequate 
roads. The car could indeed run on narrow, rutted, and sandy roads, 
but it would not give the results for which it had been designed. 
Certain complementary given elements become proportionately 
more numerous as planning improves and modern society becomes 
more complicated. These mutual relationships render limited plan­
ning impossible. The plan engenders itself, unless technique itself 
is renounced.
The same situation holds if the planner aspires to adopt a flexi­
ble plan or one independent of the state. In such a case the fun­
damentals of the plan are not obligatory. The plan appears as mere 
advice concerning what would be desirable; the producers remain 
independent, the consumers have free choice, and the attitude of the 
individual prevails over the social The flexible plan is subject to 
constant revisions and readjustments demanded by universal per­
sonal freedom. The same holds true if the attempt is made to refer 
the organization of the plan to agencies other than the state: to 
narrower organisms, such as administrative divisions of specialized 
economic organizations; or to organizations of wider scope, as, for 
example, international organizations. The appeal to international 
bodies is designed to vitiate the criticism of such writers as Hayek 
concerning the dangers of totalitarianism which arise when the 
State is in charge of the plan.
The Technological Society (181
These different proposals are extremely deceptive. The flexible 
plan has only one defect; but that defect is crucial: the plan cannot 
be realized. The reason is simple. If the plan corresponds to the 
real nature of planning, it ought to fix objectives, which normally 
would not be attained by the play of self-interest and a modicum of 
effort. It must stretch productive forces to the maximum, arouse 
energies, and exploit existing means with the maximum of effi­
ciency. (That planners do not always succeed, that administrative 
errors occur, and that not all planning invariably acts with the maxi­
mum efficiency is no more a criticism of the system than errors of 
calculation are a criticism of mathematics.) But if the individual is 
allowed freedom of decision and there is no plan, he will not make 
the maximum effort required of him. If the industrialist is allowed 
to retain full independence, he will seek out other arrangements 
and not arrive at the objectives proposed. Hence, the plan, in or­
der to be realized, must be paired with an apparatus of sanctions. 
This appears to be a veritable law of economics; planning is in­
separably bound up with coercion.
The individual does not realize spontaneously what is most ef­
ficient. Nor do the workers conform spontaneously to Gilbreth’s 
“movements.” The following alternative presents itself. Either the 
plan is flexible but is not realized, as experience shows: in spite of 
the propaganda about the Monnet plan, its objectives were only 70 
per cent realized. The flexible plan of the Bulgarians (1947) was 
37 per cent realized. The Monnet plan, which ought to have been 
completed in 1950, was actually completed in 1953, having taken 
twice the proposed time. In L’action psychologique (1959), Mai- 
gret restudies the effect on the breakdown of the plan of the ab­
sence of propaganda (which would have rendered the plan psy­
chologically compulsory). It is useless to expend the great amount 
of labor which goes into a plan only to reach a stalemate. Or the 
plan must be realized, but at the cost of loading it with sanctions 
so that it becomes more rigid. Those who count on the good will 
of mankind display a delirious, idealistic optimism. Centuries of his­
tory, despite the facts, have not been able to convince them of the 
contrary; reason certainly will not change them. But they are so 
far removed from reality that their opinion is negligible.
The problem of sanctions brings planning into relation with the 
state. Anyone who claims that planning and the state are separable,
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY182  )
or that local plans can be carried out (the TVA is always cited), has 
forgotten that local plans must be guaranteed by the state or they 
come to nothing. And this suffices to give back to the state all its 
prerogatives. It is evident (and Russia and Germany were no ex­
ceptions) that it is not the state itself which creates the plan, but 
rather some specialized organism more or less dependent on it. 
As to the TVA, the source of this enterprise was the Roosevelt 
government, which performed operations of expropriation, made 
means available, and assured sanctions.
How, then, is it possible to retain a belief in the independence 
of the plan? The bond between planning and the state is organic 
and not due to chance. At the minimum, the power of the state is 
required for a general examination of available resources and to put 
all the national forces to work. I do not use the word planning in 
the technical sense, as when one points to school-construction pro­
grams or traffic-signal installations. Local entities are of course able 
to execute such programs. But they do not represent planning any 
more than does dike construction in the Netherlands. If they did, 
the “planning” of a house by an architect would have to fall under 
this category. As to international decisions (which might be cited 
as a proof of the separation of the plan from the state), these do 
not represent plans in the proper sense of the term (for instance, 
the Bretton Woods agreements). The sole hope of realization of 
international plans— for example, in Europe— rests, as we clearly 
see today, on the existence of a European state. This kind of plan­
ning acquires substance only to the degree that such a state is con­
stituted. This fact corroborates our thesis. Only a supranational state 
would be able to convince both the national states and the trusts 
to co-operate in a common economic operatioa The Dawes and 
Young plans ended in failure because they had no means for genu­
ine sanctions and no political power to support them. Conversely, 
we note that the Marshall Plan (which became the ECA) is im­
perceptibly producing a political system. The Atlantic Pact is a cor­
relative to the Marshall Plan, and Europe will begin to organize 
itself only in the event that the ECA is seen to be completely use­
less unless it is applied to a politically ordered world.
The Americans understood perfectly that the only alternative to 
a useless expenditure of money in the ECA was a European politi­
cal organization. Unification, or even economic co-ordination, can-
The Technological Society (183
not b e conceived of independently. Mere understanding or good in* 
tentions can scarcely result in real planning. Again we are back at 
the necessary conditions for the realization of a planned economy.
That in an ideal society the connection between plan and state is 
unnecessary, just as the need for penalties disappears in the case of 
die individual as he exists in himself, I am willing to admit. But 
that does not make me believe in such an ideal and take it as a 
reality. In fact, I note that techniques of knowledge engender and 
necessitate techniques of action, and techniques of action presup­
pose certain conditions and developments in accordance with a 
true law which might be called the law of the extension of planning.
This extension of planning does not necessarily bring about a so­
cialist society. Private ownership of the means of production need 
not be modified in order to have a planned economy. Likewise, 
planning does not necessarily bring about a dictatorial state. The 
use of sanctions and propaganda can be accommodated to forms 
other than dictatorships. But when a technique invades a certain 
domain, in connection with planning, the technique effects its 
whole operation with completeness. It is useless to try to set limits 
to it or to seek some other mode of procedure.
The Great Hopes
Economic Systems Confronted by Technique. Jean Marchal is 
right in reducing to three systems die economic solutions presendy 
recommended. Marchal’s three systems are: corporatism, planning, 
and liberal interventionism. But after having correcdy observed 
that the system of planned economy is at bottom no more rational 
than the system of the market economy, he is wrong in adding that 
“the choice between the two systems follows more from philosophic 
preferences than from truly scientific considerations”; and that “nei­
ther of these systems can pretend to a total rationality.”
It is not philosophical preferences which weigh one system 
against the other, or which lead to the choice between them. If I 
ask myself which of the two ought logically to prevail, I am not 
referring to the “philosophical” choice of the masses. It is efficiency 
and success that lead history to adopt a certain direction— not man 
who in some sense makes a decision. The problem does not concern
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY184)
personal decision or preference; it is a question of discerning what 
seems most probable. At the present moment, what system is most 
efficient? I insist on the phrase at the present moment. It means 
nothing to explain that liberal capitalism was extraordinarily effi­
cient a century ago. The statement is true and we do not wish to 
deny it. But what of the present moment? If we accept the idea that 
different human systems of action ought to correspond to different 
social, political, and economic circumstances, can we uphold the 
thesis that the past efficiency of liberal capitalism is a pledge of 
present efficiency? Let us remember that from the point of view 
of efficiency the Russian and German planned economies were 
successes. And the United States adopted a planned regime when 
it was challenged by war— it may be added, with all the care and 
precaution presupposed by the critical democratic sensibility of the 
Anglo-Saxons.
Shortly after reconversion, in 1950, however, the Americans were 
obliged to embark on a new program. It was not merely an arma­
ments program (which had certain advantages in connection with 
full employment), but a sound program encompassing a group of 
countries, as indicated by Truman’s Point Four. These programs 
presupposed a planned economy.
It would seem that we are today unable to escape the facts. And 
the facts direct us toward the planned economy, regardless of our 
theoretical judgments in the matter. It is also often asked whether, 
after long periods of planned economy, the trend could be reversed. 
But this is another problem.
W emustask why these fixed and rigid programs ( which emerge 
in a planned economy) are adopted on a wider and wider scale, 
irrespective of doctrines and intentions. The only reply is that plan­
ning permits us to do more quickly and mure completely whatever 
appears desirable. Planning in modern society is the technical 
method. It does not necessarily represent the best economic solu­
tion, but it does represent the best technical solution. We must de­
mand of planning what it is able to do, and nothing else. Marchal, 
therefore, is right in saying that the planned economy is not more 
rational than the market economy. It is not at all certain that it will 
result in any greater savings. I understand that one of the pre­
occupations of economic science is whether a result has been at­
tained in the most economical manner possible. But this is possibly
The Technological Society (185
only an abstract point of view and, in any case, is secondary. The 
same problem arises in war between one general who hesitates to 
sacrifice human life and another general who desires victory at any 
cost and is willing to sacrifice everything to gain it. Unfortunately, 
our experience since the eighteenth century has been that the gen­
eral who hesitates to make the sacrifice is always defeated. The 
same problem is posed by "dumping.” In speed, intensity, and co­
herence, the technique of the plan proves superior. There may be 
waste. This is not completely certain. But it ought not to be for­
gotten that the charge of waste was one of the keenest criticisms 
leveled against liberalism. It is possible that waste will be mitigated 
through an improvement of the technique. We are not presently 
in a position to say one way or the other.
These observations might be summed up in the statement that 
in one case technique exists and in the other it does not. But things 
are not so simple. It is standard practice to set up in opposition 
the possible solutions; for example, corporatism and planning. But 
we should guard against the possibility that the contrast is com­
pletely artificial. We should guard against abandoning ourselves 
to the judgment of the specialists. The important question is one of 
perspective. Every system is composed of different elements. W e 
can put these elements in different perspectives and thereby arrive 
at different judgments. The specialist will fasten on certain specific 
elements. Either he will envisage a given system sub specie aeter- 
nitatis, in which case his judgment will be that the planned econ­
omy and the corporate economy are clearly not identical. Or he 
will envisage the system from the viewpoint of practical realization 
in all the facets of its achievements. In this case the structure of a 
corporation (or the systems of corporative production) will again 
be judged not to be the same as the structure of the planned econ­
omy in genuinely concrete details.
These elements of a given system, which are important in their 
specificity, lose importance, however, if, instead of isolating the 
system, we try to reintegrate it into the complex of society and 
into the general course of history. What then takes on importance 
are the elements in their relation. Relations are of the highest im­
portance, not mere internal consistency. It is the connections be­
tween the economic system and the state (with its technical 
means, different classes, and structures in national form) which be-
1 86 ) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMT
come characteristic. And we do not mean here theoretical connec­
tions, but real ones resulting from the internal necessity of the re­
gime. From this point of view, the corporate economy and the 
planned economy come singularly close together, to the degree 
that both systems (a) take a firm hold on the economy, (b) man­
age it on the basis of exact mathematical methods, (c) integrate it 
into a Promethean society which excludes all chance, (d) centralize 
it in the frameworks of nation and state (the corporate economy to­
day has no chance of success except as a state system), (e) cause 
it to assume an aspect of formal democracy to the total exclusion of 
real democracy, and (f) exploit all possible techniques for con­
trolling men. The kinship of the two systems is obvious in spite of 
differences in material structure.
The end pursued by both the corporate economy and the planned 
economy, and the means adopted to reach this end, are identical. 
Only the outward forms change. It is useless to compare these 
forms. History will decide which form is best— best adapted to the 
common end.
It does not seem to me to be exact, therefore, to hold that there 
are three possible economic pathways. There are only two. And 
only one of them entails the exploitation of these techniques; the 
other one ascribes the chief place to nature. ( Here again is the old 
opposition between the natural and the artificial, the artificial repre­
senting the expression of art: techni.) The complete identity, 
rather than the resemblance, between corporatism and planning 
ought to be noted. Corporatism is adapted to a traditional, culti­
vated, bourgeois mentality; planning, to an innovating, proletarian, 
pseudo-scientific mentality. But the attitude of the two is funda­
mentally the same. And, speaking objectively, the result, insofar as 
the real structure of human society is concerned, will be identical. 
As to the choice between the two, the system that can best utilize 
the techniques proposed by the economists will prevail. Up to 
now, there is no doubt that the planned society seems better able 
than the corporate society to utilize these techniques. The cor­
porate society brings to bear a whole complex of nontechnical 
considerations (sentimental or doctrinaire) which the planned 
society rejects.
It may be objected that in the planned society politics intervene 
on a major scale and that this is not technique. I would then ask
The Techndogical Society ( 18  7
what kind of politics is meant. As we shall see, politics have tended 
to become technical in the countries that have adopted planning.
The serious study of the opposition between politics and eco­
nomics, and of the relations between them, dates back perhaps 
twenty years. This opposition has tended to become less and less 
real as the two have found a common denominator in technique. 
When the economy and the political milieu are simultaneously sub­
jected to technical method, the problem of the interference of 
politics in the economy ceases to have major importance. It no 
longer has the same significance as personal influence, private inter­
est, or moral judgments. The alignment of the two has not yet been 
fully completed— and this constituted the particular weakness of 
Hitler’s Germany— but it takes more than a decade to overcome 
technically great political and economic machines.
All these considerations attest to the fundamental likeness of the 
corporate economy and the planned economy. Only these two eco­
nomic attitudes are left. They should not be considered, however, 
in their extreme aspects. A planned society does not imply that 
every detail is integrated into the plan. Nor does the plan provide 
for the humblest means. Liberalism, likewise, cannot be understood 
in its entirety. One scarcely speaks any longer of a “liberal inter­
ventionism” in which the distinction is made between the policy of 
structure (improvement of distribution, etc.) and the policy of pros­
perity (influence on the economy itself of certain means which have 
been decided upon; for example, money). The state no longer 
leaves the economy to itself; but state intervention is flexible enough 
to allow the entrepreneurs some initiative and grant ( controlled) 
freedom to the market. This is the attitude of the best minds in 
Franee. They are guided not only by a desire for equilibrium and 
a traditional confidence in the “middle of the road,” but also by a 
preoccupation with human and nonconformist elements. I do not 
deny that these elements are desirable, or that attributing a strategic 
role to the state ( while reserving tactical freedom to the citizens) 
is a tempting concept. But I am searching for the possible here. 
Would such an economic orientation really satisfy technical condi­
tions? Is it realizable in depth? The answer is certainly yes, if we 
abstract it from reality. But when we come back to reality, it is 
immediately evident that the liberal orientation represents the most 
difficult of the possible alternatives. The equilibrium we seek be-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYl88)
tween technique and freedom and between state and private enter­
prise is not stable. It is continually being put to the test and must 
be ceaselessly re-established. The tension required of the individual 
in this struggle seems to me to raise a grave question. Is it feasi­
ble to obtain from the individual ceaseless effort to establish the 
very framework of his activity? And will his activity within this 
framework be sustained? In other words, is this equilibrium the best 
possible condition for economic development? Will not the energy 
employed to secure the structural framework be dissipated in some 
other quarter? One must take account, after all, of human nature. 
This is even more true of a liberally supervised economy than of a 
totally planned economy, precisely because the former entails a 
certain degree of freedom for the individual. The human being, 
left to his own devices, will not choose the most difficult paths or 
the tightest situation. He will choose the line of least resistance. I 
am speaking of the man of the twentieth century, the product of 
the society based on ease, security, and comfort 
The average man like myself, or the entrepreneur of my acquaint­
ance, has no great desire to maintain his equilibrium at the expense 
of a ceaseless re-creating of a failing virtue. Under these conditions, 
he finds that things go badly. He far prefers a simple solution, 
summary, no doubt, and brutal, but assuring him an easy road. 
Since means of direct intervention are available, the average person 
prefers that they be used ( unless private interests lead him to prefer 
the freedom of the great beasts of the jungle). The partisans of di­
rect intervention present two conditions as necessary to its realiza­
tion: first, a reform of the state, which is henceforth to transcend 
all private interests and be endowed with competent organisms for 
flexible and concealed intervention; second, a precise and complete 
economic theory dealing with the sequence of economic events and 
the means of intervention. These two conditions amount, however, 
to a single condition: the primacy of technique. But then the same 
problems recur. There is the difficulty of preventing technique from 
going to the limit of its potentialities. There is the difficulty pre­
sented by the conjunction of economic and political techniques 
which mutually reinforce one another. And so on Is it credible that 
a state which has become really technical (we shall study its char­
acteristics in the following chapter) will be satisfied with half meas­
ures? Nothing of the kind The seeds of destruction are in the very
The Technological Society (18$
conditions proposed for the establishment o f the economic form 
represented by liberal interventionism. Thence the fundamental in­
stability which renders the attempt to establish such an economic 
form not a final solution but merely an intermediate stage.
This development (that is, from liberal interventionism to the 
fully planned society) is the more certain because liberal interven­
tionism has usually corresponded neither to the general tendencies 
of society nor to the historical situation. I certainly do not wish to 
imply that such an economic form, from the standpoint of economic 
science, is not valid or justified. But when considered in the frame­
work of today’s reality, it loses its validity.
The general tendencies of modern society are too well known for 
me to dwell on the contradictions they offer to liberal intervention­
ism. It is said that this solution, which allows for concessions and 
would abandon certain values it believes cannot be saved, in order 
to preserve certain others, represents an underhanded way of es­
tablishing collectivism. My answer is that the problem is essen­
tially spiritual. The economic orientation called liberal interven­
tionism, presupposes a spiritual revolution that has not yet even 
begun.* Again, the historical situation is eminently unfavorable to 
the philsophy of the “middle of the road.” Herein lies the chal­
lenge that is made both in war and in peace to peoples seeking to 
orient themselves in this direction.
The simple presence of the Soviet Union acts as a catalyst and 
transforms the internal situation of the semiliberal countries, 
whether they have direct economic relations with the Soviets or not 
Here we have a planned economic system in competition with cer­
tain other systems. As Marchal has shown, when contact is estab­
lished, the capitalistic countries, out of commercial necessity, are 
obliged to align themselves with the Soviet system. In other words, 
planning technique forces the competitors to imitation.
This effect has been brilliantly analyzed by Gottfried Haberler. 
He demonstrates that the development of state socialism and col­
lectivism is reflected in the whole economic complex and results in 
a generalized nationalization of economic activity and in state mo­
nopolies of foreign commerce. A country engaged in planning its 
economic activity will establish quantitative controls over foreign
* I refer the interested reader to m y book Frdience au monde mcdeme.
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOM Y1 9 0 )
trade in order to adapt it to the general national planning. Quotas 
and exchange controls are established which are then necessarily 
reflected in the commerce of nations that aspire to free activity. 
Haberler astutely notes that measures of international commerce 
taken by free nations in response to other countries with planned 
economies in turn result (if they are co-ordinated and planned) in 
a marked degree of internal economic planning. State monopolies of 
international commerce cannot result in multilateral and nondis- 
criminatory commerce. Haberler shows also that commercial agree­
ment on a liberal basis is not possible between nations with a 
planned economy and nations with a nonplanned economy.
In view of the disturbance from abroad, then, how is it possible 
to maintain the delicate mechanisms of the policy of prosperity 
based on individual enterprise?
The planned economy seems to represent the most probable solu­
tion imposed by economic technique and desired by the greater 
part of modem society, not only of men but of powers.
The real problem is not to judge but to understand.
Progress. Technique, in its action on the economy, awakened vast 
hopes in human hearts. And certainly there is no question of deny­
ing these hopes. The machine and all that came with it, all it 
brought in the way of progress, would put into human hands riches 
perhaps different but as impressive as those of legend. These riches 
would not be piles of gold or precious stones reserved for the dar­
lings of the gods, but comfort and pleasure for everyone. And if the 
carved palaces, the chests encrusted with coral and enamel, the 
scultpures and objects of gold, the precious table services, the arms 
with handles of emerald and pearl were all fated to disappear, in 
compensation every man was promised decent glassware and porce­
lain, a house in which he could be warm, abundant nourishment, 
and, little by little, comfort and hygienic surroundings that would 
assure him physical and mental harmony. Everyone was to have 
in full measure the wherewithal to live. And, more than that, new 
needs would arise which would no longer be the rare pleasures of 
initiates but simply the human condition. To drink chilled bever­
ages in the summer or to be warm in the winter would no longer be 
the costly fancy of a prince.
Poverty was retreating and, with it, man’s suffering. The machine 
was taking over. The time devoted to work remained time wasted;
The Technological Society (19 1
but it was constantly decreasing and no one imagined that this 
process would ever stop.
This extreme view of things developed so rapidly that by the 
end of the nineteenth century people saw in their grasp the moment 
in which everything would be at the disposal of everyone, in which 
man, replaced entirely by the machine, would have only pleasures 
and play. We have had to lower our sights. In practice, things have 
not turned out to be so simple. Man is not yet relieved of the 
brutal fate which pursues him. What appeared so near has again 
been postponed. Yet two wars, two "accidents,” have in no way af­
fected our glorious conception of progress. Spiteful actions of fate, 
human errors— call them what they will— men refuse to see in 
them anything that essentially aifects the marvelous progress that 
opens before them. In spite of accidents, they believe that the road 
is still free. The man of the mid-twentieth century preserves in his 
heart exactly the same expectations as his grandfather had.
No doubt he has repudiated what he thought was naive. And 
perhaps a certain distrust keeps him from enjoying the full life to 
the extent that he might have expected. Even if he is unaware of 
it, the average man preserves in his collective consciousness the 
obscure feeling that he has been duped. He had believed so com­
pletely in the takeover by the machine, and in plenty, and he does 
not wish to fall into a trap again. Nevertheless, hope persists wher­
ever tomorrows beckon; say Hitler’s Thousand Years, or the bour­
geois’s stupid notion of progress. The hope is still the same, but the 
human being (model 1950) tells himself that he can only attain 
Paradise through the destruction of his enemies. His feeling of frus­
tration— occasioned by the abrupt loss of what was possible and 
even within reach— is one of the elements behind the atrocities of 
modern wars. When man finds the foe who stands in his way and 
who alone has barred Paradise to him (be it Jew, Fascist, capitalist, 
or Communist), he must strike him down, that from the cadaver 
may grow the exquisite flower the machine had promised.
All myths directly or indirectly go back to the myth of Paradise; 
and the technical productivity man is witnessing seems to have 
spurred a proliferation of myths. Psychologists and sociologists have 
observed the appearance of new myths; and many theories have 
been advanced to account for this return of man to the sacred 
world. But such explanations are unsatisfactory because they lack
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY19J*)
a material basis. That material basis is, in fact, the enormous tech­
nical progress of the modern world. This progress restores to man 
the supernatural world from which he had been severed, an in­
comprehensible world but one which he himself has made, a world 
full of promises that he knows can be realized and of which he is 
potentially the master. He is seized by sacred delirium when he sees 
the shining track of a supersonic jet or visualizes the vast granaries 
stocked for him. He projects this delirium into the myth through 
which he can control, explain, direct, and justify his actions . . . 
and his new slavery. The myth of destruction and the myth of ac­
tion have their roots in this encounter of man with the promise of 
technique, and in his wonder and admiration.
If we consider the theses of the economists, we find that they, 
too, affirm the same hope. They locate it elsewhere and prescribe 
conditions and modalities to it, but the foundation is the same. 
Technique is for them, too, the only means of abundance and lei­
sure. Fourastie is right in putting the case numerically to dramatize 
the shortening of the work week and the enormous transformation 
in living standards and in the qualitative nature of life. The case 
is indeed simple if 1950 is compared with 1815. But it is no 
longer quite so simple if 1950 is compared with 1250. It is impor­
tant to consider, for labor, not only time but intensity. It is possi­
ble to make a meaningful comparison between the fifteen-hour 
workday of a miner in 1830 and the seven-hour workday of 1950. 
But there is no common denominator between the seven-hour day 
of 1950 and the fifteen-hour day of the medieval artisan. We know 
that the peasant interrupts his workday with innumerable pauses. 
He chooses his own tempo and rhythm. He converses and cracks 
jokes with every passer-by.
Exactly the same holds true for the qualitative nature of life. 
If a whole people is oriented toward the search for justice or purity, 
if it obeys in depth the primacy of the spiritual, it does not suffer 
from the lack of material things, just as we today do not feel the 
inverse need of the spiritual. Such preferences depend on personal 
judgment and on the society concerned.
We cannot say with assurance that there has been progress from 
1250 to 1950. In so doing, we would be comparing things which 
are not comparable. Certainly, an airplane which, after all, exists 
concretely seems like progress, compared with dim historical mem-
The Technological Society ( 193
ories. Therefore, it is advisable to limit ourselves to saying that 
there has been progress since the beginning of the industrial era, 
which was founded on the breakup and destruction of the non­
comparable and vanished old order. For modern man with his pe­
culiar orientation— which has material possessions and “stomach* 
as the central values— the period of great hopes indeed arrived. 
And these hopes are the same (even if the forms differ) for a man 
met atrandomandfora great economist.
However, as it is said in England, “you get nothing for nothing, 
and not much for sixpence.* In spite of leisure and abundance, 
supposing that leisure and abundance come in the way men expect 
them, there is a great difference between this state and Paradise. 
The difference has to do with the cost. The old dream that has 
tempted man from the beginning, the medieval legend of the man 
who sells his soul for an inexhaustible purse, which recurs with an 
enticing insistence through all the changes of civilization, is per­
haps in process of being realized, and not for a single man but for 
all. I say perhaps. Modern man never aks himself what he will have 
to pay for his power. This is the question we ought to be asking. 
(And we shall do so later, after we have completed our descrip­
tion of the technical phenomenon.)
Centralized Economy. We are now in a position to trace certain 
characteristics that technique imposes on the economy of the mod­
em world. We must recall that there is no accommodation with 
technique. It is rigid in its nature and proceeds directly to its 
end. It can be accepted or rejected. If it is accepted, subjection 
to its laws necessarily follows.
What are the effects of these laws on the economic world? The 
first trait that can be clearly perceived is the connection between 
the economic mechanism and the state. This connection exists not 
by virtue of socialist doctrines, nor because the state wills to inter­
vene, but because there is no other way of proceeding when tech­
nical development is present.
Technique always supposes centralization. When I use gas, or 
electricity, or the telephone, it is no plain and simple mechanism 
which is at my disposal, but a centralized organization. A central 
telephonic or electrical station gives substance to the whole electric 
network and to every individual piece of apparatus. The technical 
“central* is the normal expression of every application. A coexist-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY19 -#)
ence of these centrals is implied: a completely centralized organi­
zation which ultimately encompasses all human activities. Techni­
cal centralization is one of the major realities of our time. The ques­
tion is whether these centralized organs can exist independently of 
one another. Can each develop in its own specific and autono­
mous way? Jttnger, who poses this question, is correct in stressing 
that the system is not hierarchical, that every technical body is in­
dependent of its neighbor, and that there is no subordination among 
them. Economically and politically, however, the risk is very great. 
Each of the centralized bodies must be put into its proper position 
and relation with respect to the others. This is a function of the 
plan, and only the state is in a position to supervise the whole com­
plex and to co-ordinate these organisms in order to obtain a higher 
degree of centralization.
The idea of effecting decentralization while maintaining techni­
cal progress is purely utopian. For its own centralization, technique 
requires interrelated economic and political centralization. And we 
are speaking here of mechanical technique alone, without going 
into the motives of political technique.
The state, which by its very nature is the organ of centralization, 
is at the same time the organ of choice of the technical centraliza­
tion. Anyone who believes statesmen are malevolent in willing cen­
tralization demonstrates thereby only his own naivety. The state is 
forced to realize the plan for exclusively technical reasons.
We have already seen how the necessity of sanctions brings about 
a relation between the plan and the state. This relation can also 
be envisaged as the administrative framework of the state, which 
supports the techniques of planning and assures them freedom of 
operation and a certain stability. I must insist on this last charac­
teristic.
The techniques set up by the plan must envisage economic real­
ity and its probable development as faithfully as possible. In order 
to elaborate a plan, however, it is necessary to consider certain ele­
ments as stable and fixed, and not take all elements as simulta­
neously variable. But there is no guarantee that these elements 
will really be fixed. The same difficulty arises when it becomes sub­
stantially impossible to forecast the development of some factor or 
other in economic life. In such a case, either a hypothetical evolu­
tion of the factor will be posed, or the factor will be fixed arbi-
The Technological Society (195
trarily. This is a problem in a five-year plan and, much more 
acutely, in a plan of longer duration in which production must be 
projected far into the future. An excellent example is the ground­
work for the electrification of France. Should it be based on steam 
plants or hydroelectric plants? To decide this, inquiry must be 
made, among other factors, into the relative cost price of each sys­
tem for a given amount of electrical power produced. These plants 
would be designed to last for a long time; but how long? Let us 
suppose the period to be the mean duration of a waterfall, a hun­
dred years. The calculation would then proceed on this basis, 
subject to three fundamental factors: the cost of the initial estab­
lishment, the capitalization of the maintenance charges for a hun­
dred years, and the cost of coal for a hundred years. The third of 
these factors can be calculated roughly; but what of the second? 
It depends on the interest rate, which cannot be predicted that far 
im advance. There is yet another factor: monetary developments. 
How then can the plan be established? There is only one way: to re­
quire state guarantees; to obtain from the political power the as­
surance that for the realization of the plan the interest rate of the 
loans will not vary.
It may be noted in passing (and this confirms our thesis of the 
unity of the technical phenomenon) that the improvement of sta­
tistics makes it necessary for the state to intervene in economic 
technique: the publication of statistics may be of great utility to 
the intelligence services of some eventual enemy. Stuart Arthur 
Rice gives examples of statistics in foreign commerce which con­
tributed to sabotage operations. Hence, the state must centralize all 
statistics and either make available only statistics of interest to a 
given category of businessmen or manufacturers or keep completely 
secret whatever might be of interest to the enemy. This surveil­
lance was entrusted, in 1950, in the United States to the Bureau of 
the Budget. It must be noted that American public opinion is not 
content with this compromise. It tolerates badly the “indecision” 
imposed by the cold war. However, a strong minority desires a total 
blackout of statistics, as in the Soviet Union. The state would then 
have indirect, but nevertheless complete, control of economic ac­
tivity, inasmuch as it alone would know the full economic situation.
A bond is thus established between the state and the economy 
whereby technical progress is not possible without the interven-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY196 )
tion of the state. This does not mean that the whole economy is in 
the hands of the state. We ought, on the whole, to abandon the idea 
of a ravaging and dictatorial state. Let us think only of the cold 
and impersonal mechanism that holds all sources of energy in its 
hands. What is production without energy? What is the economy? 
Does not the agent that controls the supply of energy also direct the 
economy? Technically speaking, the control of energy can no longer 
be in the hands of any agent but the state. This is true even in 
the United States, as has recently been shown.
If statistics are to be given their full scope, it is necessary to co­
ordinate the actions of different organisms to avoid useless repeti­
tion, and also to pay the bill, since centers for statistical research 
do not pay for themselves. When statistical data have been col­
lected, what agency but the state is in a position to exploit them 
fully and make them yield their total practical value? It is scarcely 
necessary to recall that the very different factors that result from 
technique (trusts, atomic energy, capital concentration, the hyper­
trophic enlargement of the means of production, and many more) 
all entail state action. The relation established by technical facts, 
which become the common denominator between state and econ­
omy, is neither chance nor fleeting. There is no possibility of re­
versing the movement, as certain idealistic anti-interventionists 
would have us believe. Neither is there any hope, short of certain 
extraordinary transformations, that the conjunction of state and 
economy is transitory, as the Communists would have us believe.
Certainly, if production were to become sufficiently great, if the 
system of distribution were perfect (and, once fixed, were not sub­
ject to variation), and if, above all else, men were to become an­
gels (an indispensable condition), the conjunction between state 
and economy might disappear. The same would be true if modern 
technique were to vanish. But it is advisable to think in more re­
alistic terms.
The fact that the economy and the state are reciprocally joined 
is technically founded in such a way that the two tend to become 
aspects of the same phenomenon, a phenomenon which, moreover, 
is not the the result of a simple accretion of previous phenomena. 
It seems to me particularly important to emphasize this new charac­
ter. Because of the existence of techniques, we are beyond the 
problems of ordinary £tatism or of socialism. It is not the simple
The Technological Society ( 197
phenomenon of the growth of power or the struggle against capi­
talism which is decisive here. We are witnessing the birth of a new 
organism, the technical state, which makes economic life more se­
cure in proportion as it becomes more technical. It is no longer 
even possible to say: “It could be done otherwise.” In the abstract 
as well as in the concrete, all technical evidence attests to the con­
trary. What is involved is in fact the logical development of the 
nation-state.
This double relation (the state assuring the national life, and 
whatever pertains to the nation converging toward the state) be­
comes more specific, stronger, and more rigid when technical 
elements come into play. What was mere tendency becomes frame­
work, what was talk becomes means, and the relation of adminis­
tration to population becomes organization. And because the econ­
omy is an aspect of the nation, it, too, comes into the system. The 
state, too, changes its aspect on contact with technical elements. 
The principal goals of the economy are at first modified, but its 
elements of pride and power, potentially always there, emerge sub­
sequently in a more brutal way. Humble humanitarian motives are 
no longer important. Technique is too neutral and the state too 
powerful for either to encumber itself with such things. It is no 
longer even a question of wealth or distribution; in the technical 
synthesis, the economy becomes again the servant, when (after 
Marx) it had been thought the master.
The duel of politics and economics culminates in a synthesis in 
which politics disappears and economics is forced into submission. 
This synthesis, to be sure, has not yet been fully realized. France, 
one of the older nations, is not even completely conscious of what 
is happening. But the Soviet Union is already very close to this 
synthesis, and the United States is being oriented in this direction 
very rapidly as a result of the large-scale economic maneuvers 
into which it is being forced. And, above all, new nations such as 
Australia and New Zealand are spontaneously constructing this syn­
thetic complex. How could Africa even hope to refashion its society 
rapidly (as its new independence requires) if it did not resolutely 
embrace technical synthesis? Nasser, Mohammed V, and Castro 
are all attempting precisely this.
I remarked above that this is not socialism. With the disappear­
ance of humanitarian goals, socialism is rendered unfeasible by
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY1 9 8 )
the sheer weight of techniques. The ownership of the means of 
production ceases to be the central problem. Social equality be­
comes a myth as a result of the emergence of an aristocracy of 
technicians; and the proletariat is necessarily extended (to no 
one’s dissatisfaction), instead of disappearing. Certain elements of 
socialism continue to exist; for example, social security, the redis­
tribution of the national income, and the suppression of individual 
profit. But they exist as isolated fragments, and not as a system. It 
is not even certain that these elements will be found in all the syn­
theses now being created. Their continued existence depends on 
whether they are judged to be efficient. They cannot escape this 
judgment. An excellent example of fragmentary socialism, based on 
anything but socialistic motives, is given by Fourastie. He demon­
strates (correctly, I believe) that capital decreases in importance 
in proportion as technique increases in importance. “In a period of 
technical progress, the wage value of capital tends toward zero, 
whereas the physical product of capital constantly increases." 
Clearly, it is not a question of the absolute value of capital. Yet the 
capitalist sees his assets lose value in direct proportion to the de­
velopment of technical progress. I shall not repeat Fourastie s rea­
soning— it seems to me convincing. His conclusion, moreover, is 
of the first importance: that the center of the economic problem is 
shifting. The legal question of ownership is no longer important 
The debate no longer concerns who owns the means of produc­
tion, or who will take the profits. The crux of the economic problem 
has moved to the extreme point of technical development. The real 
debate concerns who will be in a position to support, absorb, and 
integrate technical progress and to furnish optimal conditions for 
its development
It is contrary to the nature of technique to be compatible with 
anarchy in any sense of the word. When milieu and action become 
technical, order and organization are imposed. The state itself, pro­
jected into the technical movement, becomes its agent Technique 
is, therefore, the most important factor in the destruction of capi­
talism, much more so than the revolt of the masses. Human revolt 
can only accompany the destruction of capitalism and philosophize 
about it. As to socialism, the final result is still indiscernible and no 
prediction, except of a negative nature, is possible.
The Technological Society (199
Economic centralization has been criticized on humane grounds. 
Jean Francis Gravier has attacked the movement on purely techni­
cal grounds and has attempted to show that decentralization (at 
least of the population) is necessary if society is to remain in equi­
librium. His thesis is as follows: Technique permits the diffusion of 
the population over a wide area with as well developed economic 
potentialities as the great cities. Diffusion would not be subject to 
present health hazards, oppressive costs to communities ( a resident 
of Paris costs the state five times as much as a resident of Vendee), 
and so on. This thesis, then, is based on new technical development. 
But there are three objections: First, decentralization is not possible 
unless there is a powerful planned organization for decentraliza­
tion. Such an organization usually operates on the level of the in­
dividual, not of the economic organism. Second, population diffu­
sion could lead to an urbanization of the countryside rather than 
to a true diffusion of the population into a rural milieu. Third, the 
thesis represents a mere theoretical possibility and not a necessary 
movement.
It must be admitted that actual experience seems to contradict 
the thesis. Since 1955 a serious and concerted movement has been 
under way to decentralize Paris and its industrial complex. The re­
sult so far is that six hundred industrial plants have left the area. 
But only four thousand wage earners have been resettled in the 
provinces, whereas, when the plants in question achieve full op­
eration, they will employ seventy-five thousand wage earners re­
cruited locally. Moreover, half of these six hundred plants have 
been settled in the vicinity of Paris. During the five-year period in 
question, fifty thousand new jobs have been created each year in 
Paris alone and the population of the city has risen by nearly a 
million.
Decentralization, then, has experienced a radical setback. Econo­
mists who have analyzed this setback conclude that in order to de­
centralize industrially it is necessary to effect total decentralization, 
including administrative, financial, and cultural decentralization. 
Total action, however, would be difficult to achieve; precise and 
adequate technical motives for it do not exist Furthermore, it 
would have to be implemented by authoritarian measures. The 
state would have to act to constrain the citizens with authoritarian
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY200 )
penalties corresponding to authoritarian decisions. It is easily seen 
that the proposed decentralization would have to rest upon a ma­
jor aggrandizement of centralized authority.
The Authoritarian Economy. An economy completely founded on 
technique cannot be a liberal economy. (This is not entirely the 
same as the preceding idea.) Technique is, in reality, opposed to 
liberalism, a social form which is unable to absorb and utilize 
modern techniques. It seems clear that economic liberalism is not 
in itself a technique. In fact, the attitude represented by laissez- 
faire, however much mitigated it may have become, is a renuncia­
tion of the use of techniques; techniques suppose conscious human 
action, not abstention from action.
When liberalism requires men to put their trust in the obscure 
alchemy of certain natural "laws,” it in effect restrains them from 
making use of the technical means at their disposal. These means 
permit men to intervene in the order of nature, to adjust its "laws” 
to their purposes, and to exploit them, as in the physical order. They 
also permit intervention that would appear to contradict natural 
laws and modify the order of nature. It is clear, then, that they are 
not really "laws” at all. In view of this, technique does not accord 
these nonexistent laws the respect recommended by liberalism. 
Therefore, when technique develops, both the liberal attitude and 
its doctrine become impossible. I have posed the problem at its 
most acute by placing it at the point of contact between liberalism 
and the economic techniques of intervention (which are the very 
negation of liberalism). But my thesis is just as true for the simple 
techniques of production which influence the economy. As I have 
already shown, every mechanical technique supposes a correspond­
ing organization. And organization is the diametrical opposite of 
free enterprise; and the organizational state of mind is the diametri­
cal opposite of the liberal state of mind.
It will doubtless be pointed out, by way of refutation, that pro­
duction techniques were developed during the ascendancy of lib­
eralism, which furnished a favorable climate for their development 
and understood perfectly how to use them. But this is no counter­
argument. The simple fact is that liberalism permitted the develop­
ment of its executioner, exactly as in a healthy tissue a constituent 
cell may proliferate and give rise to a fatal cancer. The healthy 
body represented the necessary condition for the cancer. But there
The Technological Society (201
was no contradiction between the two. The same relation holds be­
tween technique and economic liberalism.
Here, then, is the locus of the conflict between technique and 
the liberal economy, which Jiinger, among others, has studied. 
Technique is inevitably opposed to the liberal economy because the 
end of technique is efficiency and rationality, and the end of lib­
eralism is money profit. Technique requires of the liberal econ­
omy nonprofitable decisions and risks. For example, when expen­
sive new machines are developed before the old ones have been 
amortized, the industrialist is forced to liquidate the old machines 
or he runs the risk of being eliminated from the market. This con­
flict holds good on all levels.
When the state controls the economy, it faces similar problems. 
But such problems affect every economy. In this perspective, plan­
ning is criticized as wasteful. Yet the very criticism shows that the 
liberal mentality is still in force.
Even in a capitalist context, however, judgments concerning 
wastefulness are modified with time and according to the sector. 
In a report, the ILO has compared ordinary mechanization with 
the mechanization of offices: “The mechanization of labor in offices 
will often, against standard practice, be considered justified from 
the viewpoint of profits, even if it increases the expenses of the 
office. This is the case when mechanization increases the yield of 
the productive unit of which the office forms the administrative sec­
tion” (Mas). But even taking into consideration such partial ex­
ceptions, it remains true that conflict between technique and the 
liberal economy is inevitable because the liberal economy is essen­
tially based on profit. It does not exist without profit. To a planned 
economy, however, profit is not the highest value. Certainly, the 
planned economy does not neglect the profit motive completely, 
but profit represents only one element in its calculations. The prin­
cipal criterion of the planned economy is rationality (or effi­
ciency): in a word, technique.
In the conflict between technique and the liberal economy, tech­
nique, then, is victorious over the liberal economy and bends it to 
its laws. The process is furthered, as I have shown, by the fact that 
the liberal economy, insofar as it is thought out, itself becomes 
technique. The unity between economy and technique is thus re­
stored, but liberalism is eliminated. Economists may seek to justify
technique and economyao2)
this by speaking of “public service” or the “common good,” but 
such talk represents no more than a justification a posteriori, an 
ideological smoke screen. It is, as such, not without value, but it is 
not comparable in importance with the major fact of technical in­
vasion.
Liberalism is softened and progressively eclipsed in direct pro­
portion to the growth and imposition of techniques. The relation 
between the degradation of liberalism and the development of 
these techniques is unavoidable. The oft-heard assertion that lib­
eralism is capable of production but incapable of distribution rep­
resents the broadest view of the matter. How is it that liberalism is 
capable of producing? The answer is that, in free enterprise, pro­
duction is not a part of the liberal framework. It is, rather, subject 
to extensive planning, and it could not well be otherwise. What is 
specifically liberal is the passage of consumer goods and their dis­
tribution in the various consumer sectors; and it is precisely the dis­
tributive process which works so poorly and which is constantly be­
ing hampered, since technique throws such enormous unmeasured 
quantities of ill-considered products onto the market
The same is true of the tendency toward monopolies and trusts. 
In all sectors of the economy, this tendency is the plague and the 
destruction of liberalism. It ends either in a straightforward mo­
nopoly with no competitive' freedom (whether the monopoly is pri­
vate or of the state, the result of the contest between state control 
and liberalism is the same), o r  monopolistic competition, which is 
no less ruinous than outright monopoly because of the waste it 
causes. It is technique alone, in two different aspects, which gives 
rise to these facts. First, financial techniques are encouraged, which 
permit the establishment of institutions such as trusts and concerns 
(this would be unthinkable without a prodigious development of 
means) and assure the flexibility of these institutions on the level 
of banks and stock exchanges. Second, competition is encouraged, 
which, when it becomes established among several enterprises un­
der a liberal regime, is in reality a competition of techniques in 
the microeconomic phase. To the extent that techniques remain 
static, different enterprises are able to exist side by side, each with 
its own clientele for its own products. Some of the enterprises may 
be powerful and some weak, but the weak ones are nonetheless 
still able to subsist. It is not magnitude of enterprise which destroys
The Technological Society (203
the equilibrium, but technical progress. The moment an enterprise 
applies new procedures (for example, new public-relations tech­
niques, machines that increase yield and decrease unit cost, busi­
ness organization that makes labor more efficient, financial modali­
ties that assure greater stability), it finds that these technical 
elements give it an advantage over its competitors and allow it to 
eliminate or absorb them.
Competition is thus an incitement to such technical progress as 
will bring victory over the competitor. This means that competition 
tends to destroy liberalism. It will be objected that competition does 
not destroy the liberal economy completely because all the com­
petitors will adopt technical development. (In practice, certain sec­
tors of the economy are completely monopolistic.) In reply to the 
objection, I reiterate that technique engenders itself and that any­
one who succeeds in making a headstart in the technical domain in­
creases his advantage without limit.
For these reasons I am unable to agree completely with Vincent’s 
position. For Vincent, as for me, technique and liberalism are in­
compatible. But, it seems, his reasoning does not take account of 
all the facts. Vincent’s thesis can be summarized as follows: “How 
will the advantages of technical progress be divided in a pure lib­
eral regime, supposing perfect competition and nonintervention of 
the state? It is clear that in this hypothetical case the producers who 
have achieved technical progress would not be able to benefit 
from it, since, by hypothesis, competitors will arise to bring sales 
price to the level of decreased cost price.” We conclude that only 
the consumer would be in a position to benefit from technical prog­
ress. This implies an unexpected conclusion: since progress would 
bring no special advantage, no one could be expected to want or 
seek it  The affirmation is inescapable that pure liberalism in es­
sence compels stagnation.
This way of putting the problem is rather hypothetical and ab­
stract. Vincent himself admits it. But, even so, the reasoning is not 
convincing in itself. It is too easy to reply (and the liberals will 
not fail to do so) that the application of such simon-pure liberalism 
has never been an issue. What is important to liberals is a liberalism 
adapted to economic conditions and then stabilized. This liberal­
ism would permit technical progress.
Vincents arguments are convincing only in regard to one side of
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY*04)
the following dilemma: either liberalism remains true to itself, and 
is forced to challenge technical progress according to the arguments 
given above; or it adopts technical progress, and is obliged to repu­
diate itself. But the first alternative, that is, to stabilize the limita­
tions on liberalism, is impossible. The second alternative will be 
the actual issue. The more technical progress advances, the more 
constricted'will be the role of liberalism.
Could we not pass between the horns of the dilemma by means 
of the less and less likely possibility of competition? Just as techni­
cal progress never attains the absolute, so freedom of competition 
will doubtless never disappear absolutely. But there is a point at 
which it is no longer possible to speak of liberalism. In the most 
authoritarian regime, some freedom remains. It is nonetheless an 
authoritarian regime. The perspective changes depending on the 
time and the psychology; the point at which we stop saying “lib­
eralism” and say “controlled economy" also varies. But the process 
cannot be checked. No personal choice is possible. Certainly, it is 
not that a strict automatism comes into play. To clinch the system 
and complete the process, human decision and intervention are nec­
essary.
It might nevertheless be objected that economic laws have ex­
istence insofar as they are understood— that a choice is possible be­
tween technical intervention and a return to the free operation of 
economic laws. Unfortunately, illusions and hopes are more tena­
cious than realistic considerations. When technical progress inter­
venes, it modifies not only the application of economic laws but 
also the essence of the laws. We may consider this in two ways. 
First, economic laws are not eternal like the laws received by 
Moses on M t Sinai. Our economic laws are valid only for a certain 
type or form of economy. When technical progress occurs, it is 
integrated into the economic system not as a foreign element but 
organically. Technical progress is a part of the essence of an eco­
nomic system, not a mere accidental event. When some chemical 
substance changes the metabolism of a body, the result is a new 
situation which follows certain laws that did not hold for the pre­
ceding situations. The chemist studies a new combination from 
which he must extract new laws. When the facts change, the con­
stants, as well as the laws, are modified.
Second, even if we insist on making value judgments, on declar-
The Technological Society (205
ing a certain state to be normal and the laws that control it alone 
to be just, if, in other words, we want economic laws to be as 
rigorous and eternal as the laws of physics, the situation does not 
change. The laws of physics are known to be relative; the laws of 
microphysics in force today are not the laws we learned from our 
schoolbooks. The situation is exactly the same in economics. A 
change of scale is not merely a change of magnitude; it is a modifi­
cation of nature. In fact, technique has modified the scale of human 
economy, and the laws that held for the average economic system 
at the beginning of the nineteenth century no longer apply in the 
new scale of the economy we know today. Liberalism is only con­
ceivable if technical progress is choked off so that the system re­
mains at a fixed stage of equilibrium and of middling force.
The antinomy between liberalism and technique is further ac­
centuated when we consider that technique can give rise to noth­
ing but a mass economy. We refer here not only to the fact that the 
expanding and developing economy embraces an ever increasing 
number of human individuals and that demographic growth re­
quires such an expansion. Here we are not using the word num in 
the sense of great numbers, but in the usual sociological sense of 
mass opposed to community. It is recognized that our civilization is 
becoming a mass civilization. But we generally neglect the twofold 
fact that technique is one of the important factors of this “massifica- 
tion” and that the economy takes from it a particular form. Tech­
nique makes the economy a mass economy, that is to say, the econ­
omy taken as a whole to which we give the name macroeconomy. 
(This hypothesis is necessary in order to account for the free play 
of economic techniques.) Economic problems must be posed in 
global terms, in terms of global income, global employment, global 
demand, and so on. This global, macroeconomic conception cor­
responds to mass society, which is extremely differentiated, as we 
know. Just as technique breaks down the barriers between eco­
nomic sectors, so an economy based on technique tends to burst 
asunder the traditional sociological frameworks.
The macroeconomy is only a framework and an element of an 
economic technique. It is indifferent to free enterprise and to the 
concept of the nation, which it destroys, not voluntarily but indi­
rectly. It has no personal, private goal. It does not seek at all to 
modify a given social or economic reality. Nevertheless, the break-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY206)
down of all the traditional particularisms occurs in economics (as I 
have already described). The result of the macroeconomic method, 
to the degree that it proves itself efficient, will be to smoothe out 
economic contradictions and to encompass within the artificial what 
previously belonged to the natural. To the degree that macroeco­
nomics brings us to think in global and statistical terms, it leads to 
the suppression of the causes of fractionation, for example, na­
tional frontiers.
The macroeconomic movement toward universalism will be 
stronger the more it is reinforced by other, convergent factors. The 
first step is the constitution of an intercontinental economy (which 
technique, in any case, renders inevitable for other reasons). The 
movement toward an intercontinental economy leads to a mass 
economy.
A second characteristic of this "massification” is summarized in 
Sartre’s profound remark that “statistics can never be dialectics.” 
There is an opposition (even a mutual exclusion) between statistics 
and dialectics. They differ not merely in their mode of explaining 
but also in their very mode of apprehending the world and action. 
Statistics is necessarily a univocal method that expresses an aspect 
of reality which is uncombinable with any other (except other sta­
tistics ) and which cannot tolerate contradiction or evolutionary de­
velopment Statistics conceives evolution only in its formal aspect, 
fastening on its strictly numerical element and proceeding dis­
cretely along the number continuum which it connects by extrapo­
lation. It sets up this linear formulation as the very essence of evolu­
tion. But it is incapable of grasping in any degree the internal and 
continuous mechanism of evolution and the interplay of negations 
involved in the affirmations. Statistics (and every technique) can 
proceed only by affirmation, by exclusion of negations, refusal, and 
destruction. It implies and prescribes a logical evolution, but not 
a dialectic evolution. An economics founded on this method is of 
necessity antidialectical; it is one of the profound betrayals of 
Marxism on the part of modem Communism.
The movement of masses is likewise univocal and antidialectical. 
(The interested reader is referred to Reiwald’s L’Esprit des 
masses.) There is therefore a fixed connection between statistics 
and the economics of mass society. But only opposition exists be­
tween statistics and organic society: the life of an organic, dialectic
The Technological Society (207
society cannot be completely enclosed in a technical operation like 
statistics. Statistics even implies a mass society. Economically, this 
technical operation presupposes that all members of society partici­
pate, privately and without concern for the whole, in the economic 
system that techniques progressively elaborate. It is not only that 
everyone is inescapably a consumer and producer and as such par­
ticipates in economic life. More important, all members of society 
(not each member) are integrated in the mass into a pre-established 
system. It is the facts of “all” and “pre-established,” required by the 
use of technique, which involve the mass.
The “all” is involved because technique yields results and de­
mands effort to such a degree that no individual can remain out­
side. But if technique demands the participation of everybody, this 
means that the individual is reduced to a few essential functions 
which make him a mass maa He remains “free,” but he ,can no 
longer escape being a part of the mass. Technical expansion re­
quires the widest possible domain. In the near future not even the 
whole earth may be sufficient.
The “pre-established” is involved because technique has its laws 
and its motives (which I have already outlined) and fashions the 
frameworks that are most auspicious to it We are experiencing this 
in the modern world. Despite the preoccupations of humanist 
economists, the economic mechanism tends to become stricter, ad­
hering to reality through its technique but, at the same time, ab­
sorbing it Men must enter into a pre-established framework. Tech­
nique cannot act otherwise than to “pre-establish” them too; if it 
did not act so, it would not even exist itself.
We now see why the social complex, on contact with technique, 
becomes mass, rather than a community or an organism. Technique 
demands for its development malleable human ensembles. We 
have already encountered this characteristic in our discussion of 
technical expansion, and we find it again (in a very typical way) in 
our study of the influence of technique on the economy. The econ­
omy, oriented in this direction, supposes mobile masses of men 
available to needs which are simultaneously economic and tech­
nical.
Every undertaking involving a real community is necessarily anti- 
technical on the economic level, not only because it is relatively 
static but because of its particularism. If genuine communities were
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY208  )
to develop, no further economic technique would be possible. I am, 
of course, speaking here of true communities, not of counterfeit 
communities such as the corporations have represented since 1935. 
We conclude, then, that the social form most auspicious to economic 
technique is the mass. In this form, the calculus of probabilities and 
planning both have free play.
The Antidemocratic Economy. All this being so, we touch upon 
a new characteristic of economic technique: it is inevitably anti-, 
democratic. At first glance, this comment sounds surprising, even 
shocking. After all, technique does bring the masses of men into the 
economic circuit, allowing them to participate in it as they never 
did before. In the technical affirmation of the present, we can point 
to the fact that we are witnessing the forward movement of social­
ism: management committees, autonomous administration of social 
security, profit sharing, workers’ councils (which exist not only in 
the Soviet Union), and the achievement of recognized status by the 
labor unions, which thus can play a positive (not merely a revolu­
tionary) role.
How, under these circumstances, is it possible to speak of the 
technical economy as antidemocratic? In reply, it would be easy to 
show that all these different kinds of "progress” become feasible 
only to the degree that men are subjected in advance to the action 
of technique. The opposition men manifest to this slavery (and it 
is a kind of slavery) is merely superficial, a matter of self-interest, 
and is not due to any basic revolutionary orientation. Men are un­
able to exert genuine influence on the direction of the economy. 
They can change certain modalities of wages. They can alter the 
direction of enterprise and intervene in certain economic forms to 
compensate for certain mechanical drawbacks; and they can give 
opinions on fabrication, procedures, and financial methods. None 
of these is negligible and I have no desire to minimize their impor­
tance. But they do not add up to economic democracy.
Collective ownership of the means of production (from the point 
of view of nationalization, collectivization, or state socialism) is an 
abstraction, an even greater abstraction than political democracy. 
W e well know to what degree of abstraction political democracy 
has been pushed and how little the vote of the citizens actually 
counts despite all the talk about “popular sovereignty.” The means
The Technological Society (2 0  9
of production are said to be the property of the people. But can the 
people do with them what they wish? Can they actually nominate 
their leaders? These are the real questions. If the people directly 
concerned in some business affair (for example, the workers in an 
industrial plant) were to decide to exploit the plant in some other 
way, or not to exploit it at all, or even to destroy the machinery, 
would anyone listen to them? If no one listened, under the pretext 
that the decisions in question were senseless, the real reason would 
be that there are criteria superior to the popular will according to 
which popular will is judged. Popular will can only express itself 
within the limits that technical necessities have fixed in advance. 
Can the people select engineers? Or accountants, or organizers? 
Can they pass judgment about methods of work? If they could, it 
would amount to the system (which has actually been attempted) 
in which judges are elected by the governed, tax collectors by the 
taxpayers, generals by the privates. Such a system would represent 
the only truly democratic method. Why is the democratic method 
not applied in the areas cited, whereas we do elect politicians. For 
the simple reason that the functions of judge, general, and engineer 
are considered to be functions of technicians, but the politician is 
deemed to be a nontechnical functionary: good for everything, 
good for nothing.
The Russian and French Revolutions introduced popular elec­
tion of judges and generals: this was consistent with their con­
cept of democracy. But the results were so disastrous that it was 
soon necessary to repeal this procedure.
Technique is the boundary of democracy. What technique wins, 
democracy loses. If we had engineers who were popular with the 
workers, they would be ignorant of machinery. In our time, tech­
nique is the court of last appeal. The worker is master neither of 
his factory nor of his bosses.
The democracy of popular “control” is purely formal. The situa­
tion in this respect is the same in all representative democracies in 
which all things technical are taken out of the control of the elec­
tors, who must thenceforth repose their faith in an ideology of 
political function superior to all others and encompassing every 
human activity. By its intermediacy, the elector would still be 
master of his destiny. Unfortunately, when the politician intervenes
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY2 1 0 )
to advance the cause of his constituents, he succeeds only in dis­
turbing the proper functioning of technique, in making everyone 
discontented, and ultimately in losing his powers.
Are we, then, to believe today that by some secret alchemy the 
workers, who hold title to a purely abstract property, really inter­
vene in the economic game? Were it really so, it could only be on 
condition that they had to do with an extraordinarily flexible, not 
to say slovenly, economy. It would certainly be nontechnical. If 
such an economy were even conceivable, it would be a noncapital­
ist liberalism, that is to say, anarchy.
When the economy becomes exact and technical, it cannot toler­
ate the intervention of the working man’s desires. Certainly, there is 
such a thing as benevolent and rational regulation of labor, human 
industrial relations, hygiene, and so forth. But this is the internal 
regulation that a good technique supposes and requires. The only 
possibility of obtaining a high, continuous, and profitable produc­
tivity is by taking adequate account not only of immediate, bare 
yield but also of the conservation of human material, which also 
represents a kind of capital. At present the working man’s wishes 
happen to coincide well with the imperatives of a rather exact and 
profound technique. This is the only reason his wishes are taken 
into account. The real function, then, of the worker’s desires is to 
advance and improve technique, and not at all to enhance his free­
dom. This fact has a political parallel: in elections under authori­
tarian regimes, ballots may be cast only for the regime. Although 
the authority of the government is thereby increased, the elector 
draws material advantages from his vote, for the government, 
officially relying on the people, will commit itself to great efforts in 
their behalf.
There can be no doubt that this kind of democratization leads to 
a certain improvement in the lot of the people. But it is an improve­
ment brought about not by the people themselves, who are mere 
servitors, but by technique, to the degree and according to the con­
ception of life dictated by technique.
It is possible to envisage the democratic effect of technique in 
another perspective, that of consumption. It is currently argued 
that technique eliminates social privileges and suppresses pre­
existing social distinctions (although we must recognize that it 
establishes certain others in their stead). The Italian economist
The Technological Society (211
Bertolino gives a good example of this argument in his study of 
standardization. Standardization produces certain democratic ef­
fects, according to this economist, for two reasons. First, it reduces 
prices; consequently consumption is increased, welfare is more 
widely distributed, and living standards are equalized. Second, it 
reduces the types of available merchandise; there is less diversity 
on the market and choice is limited. These two factors tend toward 
democratic equalization. The search for what is “distinctive,” which 
is based on a diversity of economic powers, is rendered impossible. 
Hence, technique should operate in the direction of democracy.
This argument represents exactly the same attitude as that of a 
Henry Ford driven by democratic sentiment to mass-produce auto­
mobiles so that everyone might benefit from this luxury article. 
But the mass production of automobiles required the employment 
of tens of thousands of workers on the assembly line. Bertolino 
passes very lightly over the disadvantages thus occasioned, but 
we must pay close attention to them. For example, there is the 
danger of unemployment. In case of substantial unemployment, 
there is no increase in the public welfare even though prices de­
cline. Bertolino's argument does not seem to me to be decisive.
No more decisive is the argument that technique produces social 
equality. To argue, as Mumford does, that social equality exists be­
cause the poor man’s electric light is identical with the rich man’s, 
whereas in the middle ages an enormous difference existed be­
tween a pitch pine torch and a luxurious candle, is to risk proving 
the exact opposite of what was intended. The life of the lord of the 
manor was in many ways closer to that of a serf than the life of a 
modem industrialist is to that of a worker. The serf and the lord 
shared the same nourishment and the same discomfort. There is 
certainly at least as much difference between the poor man’s 
cheap radio and the rich man’s Telefunken, or between a motor 
scooter and a Chrysler, as between the pine torch and the candle. 
We could adduce an endless number of such comparisons.
The question may be asked; what is the price we must pay for 
Standardization? Bertolino indicates this price very clearly. In 
the first place, it is essential that cost reduction not be expressed in 
wage reduction or unemployment. The state must intervene to see 
to this. In the second place, cost reduction must be translated into 
reduction in sales price. The state must enforce obligatory redue-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOM Ytit)
tions in sales prices. In the third place, standardization must be 
applied in its totality; it must not be merely of limited effect. It 
must be applied to a whole industry, and if the industry is suffi­
ciently important this will inevitably lead to the standardization of 
related and complementary industries. Here again the state must 
intervene with either persuasive or coercive measures.
It is already clear that standardization, as a “democratic’*  effect, 
implies extremely authoritative state action, extensive controls, a 
more and more forced centralization, and a pronouncedly undemo­
cratic state of mind. Moreover, one cannot fail to be somewhat sur­
prised to leam that the reduction of “types” is a democratic process. 
Bertolino says that this reduction leads sometimes to a single type 
and, one must suppose, the consequent nullification of choice. But 
until now it has seemed that the very essence of democracy was 
precisely the choice among several solutions, several types, several 
doctrines, and that, moreover, this choice was left freely to the 
people. The exercise of democracy was the exercise of choice. 
Where there is no longer any choice, dictatorship exists.
But we must analyze this notion of choice further. We often say; 
“It is not democratic that certain persons are excluded by poverty 
from certain blessings, which deprives them of any possibility of 
choice. If we extend well-being by standardization, we will im­
prove the democratic conditions of the poor.” Unfortunately, this 
is not the case. If we admit the fact ( which is certainly true) that 
the absence of choice occasioned by poverty is antidemocratic, it is 
not by removing the more or less great freedom of choice— which 
the majority still possess— that we will have democracy. In all coun­
tries the majority still have some choice, and to take this away from 
them is to consecrate the opposite of democracy. Bertolino is aware 
of this: he attempts to compensate for his risky assertion in two 
ways. First, he tells us that standardization must be accompanied 
by inquiry into human tastes and desires, a procedure which will 
reintroduce personal choice within standardization, so to speak. 
The proposal appears to be completely utopian. Standardization 
implies a certain investment of funds over long periods. But, clearly, 
these investments will never be seriously questioned just because 
the public taste changes. Furthermore, technical development fol­
lows its own proper laws, not the tastes of the public. It was not the 
public which demanded air travel and television. Technical prog-
The Technological Society ( a 13
ress created these things, and they were technically diffused and 
imposed on the public. The mechanism of standardization is identi­
cal with that of every technique.
Second, Bertolino supposes standardization to be democratic in­
sofar as it represents the conviction of the individuals who accept 
it. It is not sufficient that it be egalitarian in fact, It must be accom­
panied by the popular consciousness that an egalitarian situation 
and a more complete equality are being realized through its agency 
and that the people are thus making progress toward a social de­
mocracy. If a regime is sanctioned by the people, it can indeed be 
maintained that it is democratic. But, of course, that is precisely 
what Hitler said of his regime. We must not lose sight of the fact 
that today popular support can be secured with great ease by 
means of certain precise techniques. But this point does not matter 
much here. What is important is the fact that Bertolino’s desire to 
show at any price that technique is democratic leads to a strange 
conception of democracy. We may best illustrate this by means of 
two quotations: “Democracy is the adhesion of each citizen individ­
ually to the opinion of the majority. This majority opinion becomes 
an irrefragable and indisputable fine of conduct. The individual 
is duty bound to look upon the line (economic or political) dictated 
by the majority as the best for society. The individual becomes 
democratic in this way. . . ." “Democracy consists in the practice 
of regarding and using certain goods in a common way. Democracy 
supposes that the individual transcends himself in order to realize 
social values with the others, and in the same way as the others.'*
These textual citations recall some strange speeches we have 
heard. The transition of the majority to a condition of unanimity 
through the adhesion of the individual, who renounces his in­
dividuality to meld with the collectivity, is precisely the transition 
from democracy to dictatorship. It is true that standardization 
demands this kind of democracy and that it could not be reconciled 
with any other democratic form. But democracy in this case is 
only a name superimposed on the reality of dictatorship. Whatever 
aspects of economic technique we examine, we always find this 
opposition between technique and democracy.
The conflict between technique and democracy appears clearly 
in Soviet planning. The Soviets maintain that the Five-Year Plan 
(in its second phase) moves from the base to the summit, and that
2 1 4  )  TECHNIQUE AMD ECONOMY
the decision of the base is decisive. However, the following ques­
tion cannot be avoided: since technicians establish both norms and 
details, how is it possible to reconcile production directives, which 
originate at the summit, with the desires of the workers’ cells at 
the base? Soviet studies maintain that this antinomy can be re- 
•solved by so-called “production conferences.” But what we wit­
ness in fact is a technical centralization of wages and norms. Par­
ticularly instructive and worthy of note is the history of the plan 
of 1955. Khrushchev, in denouncing the errors of Stalin, declared 
that until then planning had been "bureaucratic,” “authoritarian,” 
“based on mere statistics”— and, moreover, that the plan of 1950 
had been fulfilled by only 30 per cent of enterprises. He said that it 
was necessary to democratize the plan because the “active partici­
pation of the workers was indispensable. . . .” What, in fact, has 
been the result of Khrushchev’s good intentions? (1) The workers 
have been given latitude to increase the goals set by the plan, but 
not to decrease them; (2) the workers have had freedom to study 
ways and means to obtain maximum productivity; (3) a propa­
ganda campaign for increasing productivity has been launched 
which has turned out to be the most intensive since the original 
introduction of five-year plans. In this campaign the slogan is re­
peated ceaselessly: “The State Plan is the law for every enterprise.” 
Democratic freedom is clearly discernible in all this!
The decisive point in the development of these “production con­
ferences” is the necessity of technical progress, which may not be 
held back by the desires of the workers.3  A workers’ committee can­
not regulate the complexity of technical problems. Moreover, a 
view of the whole (which the worker certainly cannot have) is 
necessary in order to unify wages and norms on the plane of the 
macroeconomy. Without this, social inequality and economic dis- 
equilibration would be inevitable. Along the same line, a stringent 
control of production tempos and distribution of revenues is man­
datory— whatever the efficiency of the plan.
All this leads, both for the elaboration of the plan and for its 
execution, to the primacy of technical demands imposed authorita­
tively on all democratic orientations. All that is demanded of the 
man who carries out the plan is that he adapt himself to its norms
See Kerblay’j  Let Normes dam Fdconomk lovktique.
The Technological Society (215
and that he find a stimulus to his productivity in the overfulfill­
ment of these norms. All that can be conceded to him is sufficient 
time to adapt himself to the norms. To save face, there is endless 
talk about psychological climate, environment, and socialist rivalry. 
(We shall study this point in detail in the last chapter.) It suffices, 
for the present, to make the following comparison: a soldier who 
takes part in an attack because he is forced to do so and a soldier 
who is moved by patriotic enthusiasm do not share the same psy­
chological climate. But both bring themselves to kill in the same 
way. As far as efficiency and collective results are concerned, psy­
chological methods have been discovered and elaborated which 
give the first soldier a belligerence equivalent to the patriotic ardor 
of the second. Democracy has nothing to do with the matter.
Democracy did not enter either into the theorem (conceded by 
the majority of economists) that full employment, which is neces­
sary to the sound development of economic technique, demands an 
authoritarian method of worker placement. As Fourastie indicates, 
technique implies a transformation that makes “production due to 
human labor the very foundation of social progress; so that no social 
progress can occur without transference of the working popula­
tion.” But where is the democratic element in displacing the 
human being from his familiar surroundings, separating him from 
his traditions and from his human and geographic milieu? I know 
that the uprooting of human beings counts for little in respect to 
economic law and that where economic necessity exists (for ex­
ample, in the struggle against unemployment) all other human 
needs are unimportant and must vanish. I am, moreover, cognizant 
of the seeming truth that where there is nothing to eat there is no 
longer a stable milieu. This new version of the primum vivere in a 
materialist form is only an apparent truth. But even if it were 
true, we would have to say then that the human being is con­
strained by economic necessity, and this is the exact opposite of 
democracy.
This method presupposes the destruction of our social structures 
and, in reality, deprives a civilization of any chance to give itself 
form. The primary element in any civilization is a stable relation 
between man and his environment. When man becomes the play­
thing of abstract decisions, a civilization can no longer be created. 
Here we have, on the economic plane, the same effect of technique
21  6 ) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY
which we previously studied in a more general way. Man indeed 
participates in the economy, but technique causes him to participate 
not as a man but as a thing.
It is in the realm of economic technique that we experience most 
clearly the great and dramatic process of modem times, in which 
both chance and natural laws are transformed into decisions of 
accountants, rules of planning, and decrees of the state. It is exactly 
at this point that technique begins to be concerned with natural 
fact— with the fact of total human behavior, with man’s spontane­
ous obedience to so-called sociological currents, with his conformity 
to certain general types, with his responses (almost everywhere the 
same) to given stimuli. Whether the question is one of understand­
ing public opinion, or of stochastics, or of statistics as a whole, the 
technical starting point is always the human behavior of the major­
ity. From this behavior, technique draws a number of consequences 
and modes of action, erecting on it the system into which it will 
necessarily insert itself. Moreover, it makes this behavior obliga­
tory. It allows certain minor modifications (w e shall not concern 
ourselves with the problem of aberrants), but its real problem is to 
transform a law spontaneously obeyed into a law made con­
sciously obligatory. In no other domain is this procedure of tech­
nique as clear-cut as in the present forward movement of the econ­
omy. The effects of technique in other areas are not as evident; for 
example, the effects of “human techniques” such as propaganda 
have not yet been rendered obligatory to the same degree as tech­
nique in the economic field.
Thus, economic techniques, despite their still rudimentary na­
ture (often more pronounced in this respect than mechanical, psy- 
vuulugical, or judicial techniques), nevertheless express better than
any others the transition, implied by every technique, from the 
natural to the artificial. It is not that economic techniques are better 
developed than the others, but that here, more than elsewhere, the 
artificialevolves from the natural.
Every technique tends, more or less, to constrain nature; accord­
ingly, the artificial is opposed to the natural. There is a struggle, 
but whether it be expressed in terms of man against nature or in 
terms of the conflict of systems, the desideratum is a mastery that 
excludes, eliminates, and replaces the natural. Thus, for example,
The Technological Society ( 2 1 7
the directed and planned economy replaces liberalism. But we 
note in this domain another more subtle, integrative movement. 
Economic technique tends less to eliminate the natural than to inte­
grate it. (In this sense it approaches the mode of action of physical 
techniques. And Francois Perroux’s criticism of planning, relative 
to its "lack of rationality,” rests on the fact that planning suppresses 
the free mechanism of the economy instead of adhering to it and 
interpreting it. The latter, for Perroux, should be the ideal of eco- 
nomictechnique.)
But when the natural is integrated, it ceases to be natural. It be­
comes part of the technical ensemble. It is an element of the mecha­
nism, an element which must play its role, and no more. The role 
may be plotted in advance. Even when, as in the case of servo­
mechanisms, the improvement of technique introduces unforeseen 
elements and leaves a large part of the operation in the realm of 
the natural, it is nonetheless integrated.
I will be asked whether there is anything evil in this integration. 
I make no value judgments; I merely note that the human being 
who acts on his own personal decisions, following what is in essence 
a common tendency, a sociological current, acts freely, but that the 
same tendency, once integrated into a system, becomes essen­
tially and expressly obligatory.
It might be asked whether man had not lost his freedom even be­
fore this integration, since he was obeying an already existing al­
though hidden imperative, now revealed by modem techniques. 
Is man more constrained than formerly merely because this impera­
tive is recognized and written down in textbooks? This does not 
seem clearly evident. Even without reference to the danger rep­
resented by monopoly of the secrets of our actions on the part of a 
few ( and it is always the few who succeed in gaining control of the 
instruments of technique), the simple act of writing it down 
changes human obligation. In the sociological and economic world, 
the result is comparable to the long-recognized transition from 
morals to law. There, too, sanctions appear to have been decisive. 
What is the sanction against violating the moral law, or refusing 
to follow a sociological tendency, or disobeying natural economic 
law? And what is the sanction against a challenge of the law of the 
state and the plan? Is not the difference clear? What is at stake 
here is all of man’s liberty, the liberty to take chances, even to
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMYax8 )
gamble with the death penalty. We see in this loss of liberty the 
downward path into which technique is leading us.
Economic Mon
Let us not overdramatize; it is not the goal of the technical move­
ment to drive men to the death penalty. Happily, its goal is more 
subtle. The death penalty is only a straw, the existence of which 
testifies to the fact that technique is in a transitory phase.
The transformation of natural law into technical law is accom­
panied by the shaping of the human being; he is adapted and made 
to harmonize with what is to be. Social individualism corresponded 
to economic liberalism. The economic man corresponds to the 
planned economy.
I am aware that economic man was a creation of the liberal 
period and the first economic doctrinaires, but the question is to 
understand the problem. The term economic man generally re­
ferred to a purely theoretical concept. For the liberals, economic 
man was an abstraction created to satisfy the demands of economic 
inquiry. The conception was a working hypothesis. It was framed 
by omitting certain human characteristics, which man undeniably 
possesses in order to reduce him to his economic aspect of producer 
and consumer. The abstraction corresponded to a complete anthro­
pology, current at the beginning of the nineteenth century, which 
can only be characterized as dichotomous.
This conception of man has had a changing history. The studies 
of Jean Merigot on economic man undertook to demonstrate that, 
in terms of the doctrine and economic theory of the present, this 
abstract simplification is no longer admissible, for two reasons. 
First, the human being is a whole and this whole changes in the 
very act of being analyzed; and second, economic phenomena act 
and react correlatively to the totality of the human being. Conse­
quently, Merigot asserts, it is impossible to be satisfied with this 
one-sided view. But all this remains on a purely intellectual plane 
and the “progress" he describes is to be found only in textbooks of 
political economy. The great satisfaction manifested by certain au­
thors that the homo economicus is dead remains purely theoretical.
I should like for my part to note another set of developments.
The Technological Society (219
Technique, and especially economic technique, does not en­
counter man in textbooks but in the flesh. One of the facts which 
seems to me to dominate the present epoch is that the further eco­
nomic technique develops, the more it makes real the abstract con­
ception of the economic man. What was merely hypothesis tends to 
become reality incarnate. The human being is changing slowly un­
der the pressure of the economic milieu; he is in process of becom­
ing the uncomplicated being the liberal economist constructed. The 
transition of the purely theoretical image to its incarnation is what 
concerns us here. It is occurring at a time when the theoretical 
economist is beginning to take account of the real complexity of 
man, a complexity which, however, man is in process of losing (if 
he has not already lost it altogether). The result is that the modem 
economist still runs the risk of theorizing about an abstraction be­
cause he is speaking either of a man philosophically conceived 
or of some historical and traditional image. He is not speaking of the 
man of today, the man we do not dare to recognize because we can­
not bear to find in him our own faces or to meet in him the prefigur­
ing of our own destiny.
The economic man, that reduced schema of economic activity, 
was formulated in the second half of the nineteenth century by a 
twofold movement. The first was the absorption, to a greater and 
greater extent, of the entire man in the economic network. The 
second was the devaluation of all human activities and tendencies 
other than the economic. Thence arose the validation of the pro- 
ducing-consuming part of man, while all his other facets were grad­
ually erased. This reduction of man is the first movement to come 
to completion under the reign of the triumphant bourgeoisie. It is 
hardly necessary at this point, by way of explanation, to recall the 
predominant importance that money assumed during this period. 
Everything happened through its agency, in the economic and 
social structure, in the business world, in private life. Nothing hap­
pened without money; everything happened by means of it. All 
values were reduced to money values, not only by the theoreticians 
but by practice. The only important human occupation seemed to 
be to make money. And this became, in fact, the symbol of human 
submission to economies, an internal submission more serious than 
the external. For primitive man, hunting likewise represented eco­
nomic submission, but this submission was more a magical and
tto) TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY
virile act. The bourgeois domination of the nineteenth century was a 
rational domination. It excluded all romantic enthusiasm. It sought 
not paradise but temporal power, and marveling at what had come 
to pass, it took the newly discovered economic forces as its instru­
ments of choice. But to use these instruments meant submission to 
them. The bourgeoisie itself submitted and compelled everyone 
else to submit. The world was divided into two classes: those who 
created the economy and amassed its rewards, and those who sub­
mitted to it and produced its riches. Both classes were possessed by 
i t  The bourgeoisie, in a two-pronged attack, constructed an eco­
nomic morality which exhausted the totality of its values and sub­
ordinated men to economic power. A new spiritual situation was 
created that was ultimately destined to make the new bourgeois 
morality collapse, leaving intact the primacy of the economic.
The bourgeois morality was and is primarily a morality of work 
and of metier. Work purifies, ennobles; it is a virtue and a remedy. 
Work is the only thing that makes life worthwhile; it replaces God 
and the life of the spirit More precisely, it identifies God with 
work: success becomes a blessing. God expresses his satisfaction by 
distributing money to those who have worked w ell Before this 
first of all virtues, the others fade into obscurity. If laziness was 
the mother of all the vices, work was the father of all the virtues. 
This attitude was carried so far that bourgeois civilization neglected 
every virtue but work.
It is understandable that for the adult bourgeois the only im­
portant thing became the exercise of a metier, and for the youth, 
the choice of an occupation and preparation for it. A kind of eco­
nomic predestination was established in the great families. Human 
destiny seemed to revolve about the making of money or the fail­
ure to make it. Such was, and is, the viewpoint of the bourgeois.
For the proletariat the result was alienation, which likewise rep­
resented the grip of the economic on the human being. In the pro­
letariat, we see human beings emptied of all human content and 
real substance, and possessed by economic power. The proletarian 
was alienated not only because he was the servant of the bourgeois 
but because he became a stranger to the human condition, a sort of 
automaton filled with economic machinery and worked by an eco­
nomic switch. But human nature cannot long tolerate such a condi­
tion. In creating it, the bourgeoisie signed the death warrant of its
The Technological Society ( m
own system. The spiritual situation of alienated man implies revo­
lution, and his subordination without hope demanded the creation 
of the revolutionary myth. It might be thought that the primacy of 
the economy over man (or, rather, the possession of man by the 
economy) would have come into question. But unfortunately, the 
real, not the idealized, proletarian has concentrated entirely on 
ousting the bourgeoisie and making money. The proletarian instru­
ment for winning this revolution is the labor union. And the union 
subordinates its members even more closely to the economic func­
tion in the process of satisfying their revolutionary will and ex­
hausting their will with regard to purely economic objects.
The bourgeois himself is losing ground, but his system and his 
conception of the human being is gaining. For the proletariat, as 
for the bourgeoisie, man is only a machine for production and 
consumption. He is under obligation to produce. He is under the 
same obligation to consume. He must absorb what the economy 
offers him. Indeed, in the face of a historically unparalleled con­
sumption of goods, it is ridiculous to explain crises of overproduc­
tion as crises of underconsumption.
The counterpart of the necessary reduction of human life to 
working is its reduction to gorging. If man does not already have 
certain needs, they must be created. The important concern is not 
the psychic and mental structure of the human being but the unin­
terrupted flow of any and all goods which invention allows the 
economy to produce. Whence the measureless trituration of the 
human soul, the true issue of which is propaganda. And propa­
ganda, reduced to advertising, relates happiness and a meaningful 
life to consumption. He who has money is the slave of the money he 
has. He who has it not is the slave of a mad desire to get it. The first 
and great law is consumption. Nothing but this imperative has any 
value in such a life.
This summary description enables us to grasp quickly the sub­
jective and incoherent way in which the human being tends to per­
mit himself to be reduced to the two closely related variables of 
the economic man. All other dimensions are excluded in this ideal­
ized concept Money is the principal thing; culture, art, spirit, mo­
rality are jokes and are not to be taken seriously. On this point, there 
is once again full agreement between the bourgeoisie and the Com­
munists.
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY222  )
The phenomenon we witness here is the birth in reality of the 
economic man the classical economists postulated. Man is not essen­
tially homo economicus. But the concept is relatively simple; and 
the pressure of economic events, greater than ever before, has 
made it necessary to put man through this rolling-mill in order to 
obtain the indispensable material substratum. The operation has 
not always been easy. Sometimes the machine has gotten stuck. 
The bourgeoisie did not succeed entirely in eliminating the life of 
the spirit. In the working class, a true spiritual life developed about 
the turn of the century. Literature with Rimbaud and painting 
with Van Gogh were enormously attractive in comparison with the 
rolling-mill. Man remained, if not whole, at least dissatisfied with 
his castration, the more so as the promises which had been made 
were not kept and economic crises continually endangered the 
new blessings.
The second phase of this development was the attempt of the 
human being to find Spiritual satisfaction within the economic 
sphere itself. Karl Marx carried out the encircling maneuver, taking 
over from the bourgeoisie and continuing its work. On the plane 
of the human and of spiritual life, Marx was— in a deep and not 
merely formal sense— a faithful representative of bourgeois 
thought. He did not represent the official thought of the bour­
geoisie in the manner of Thiers or Guizot. But he did represent the 
current thought of the average man, which ideologically was ma­
terialistic and in practice was even more so. Marx sought to make 
a going concern of what, he was convinced, the bourgeoisie was in 
the process of losing. To the spiritual force of the emergent- prole­
tariat, he added economic force. He integrated the revolution, as 
well as all life, into the economic world. He consecrated, theoreti­
cally and scientifically, the common sentiment of all the men of his 
century and furnished it with the prestige of dialectic. Proudhon 
and Bakunin had placed spiritual forces in rivalry with the eco­
nomic order. Against them, Marx upheld the bourgeois order of the 
primacy of the economic, not, however, as a merely historical pri­
macy but as a primacy in human hearts. If economic conditions 
are changed, men are changed. Marx made a success of the terrible 
confiscation. The spiritual resources released from oppression were 
to be put at the service of the oppressor, not, indeed, the bourgeois 
oppressor but the economic one. (In my Presence au monde mod-
The Technological Society (2  2 3
erne I have studied in detail this mutation of the revolutionary 
idea.)
The second prong of this double movement (the subordination 
of men to economic power) did not apply to all men, only to those 
who ventured to escape from the subjective creation represented 
by the homo economicus. We have been studying how this con­
cept was slowly and circuitously brought into being by certain 
modes of thought, social conditions, and doctrines. Its progress was 
insidious and sometimes groping. But the individual still had cer­
tain possibilities of escaping it. The escape hole was narrow and 
growing narrower. Sometimes escape was found only in dreams. 
Poetry is useful to this end. Rostand, for example, faithfully served 
to satisfy the homo economicus by giving him an illusion of the 
spiritual. And Peguy taught us, not in his writings but in his life, 
that the whole man was still possible. In proportion as the milieu 
became more restrictive, the economic world approached comple­
tion. It became more and more difficult for anyone to do anything 
except work in order to live. But for what? Exclusively for consump­
tion. Leisure was granted to man, but only the leisure of the con­
sumer. Man’s primordial functions of creating, praying, judging 
disappeared in the rising tide of material goods. Conditions were 
at last ripe for bringing off the decisive operation. Technique com­
pleted its movement of encirclement and put the finishing touch to 
the economic man, in accordance with its unchanging procedure 
of transforming what is into what ought to be and making out of 
mere gropings an irrefutable and simple line. Technique was no 
longer a spontaneous movement; it was a concerted action to shape 
the economic man it needed.
In order for economic technique (for example, planning) to 
succeed, men had to satisfy its requirements. There is no such 
thing as technique by and in itself. In its irresistible forward prog­
ress, it forced the human individual, without whom it is nothing, 
to accompany it. For this reason economic man, a working hypoth­
esis when economics was only a doctrine, was forced to become 
reality when reality became technical. This mutation (which had 
been prepared in the manner we have studied) was not completely 
a creation of technique, but technique found in it what it required. 
Stalin* as well as the liberal economists, considered man as “capi­
tal.” And Jacques Aventur has shown that, from the technical
TECHNIQUE and economy** 4 )
point of view, man must be appraised as capital. To recoil before 
this conception is merely a sentimental reaction. No efficiency is 
possible for economic technique in the absence of exact calculation 
of average human production costs and human profit-making abil­
ity. Man is capital, and he must become perfectly adapted to this 
role. The actions proposed by technique to educate man for this 
role fall into two distinct categories. The first is essentially economic 
and does not lead to immediate and direct action on human beings. 
The second, however, implies the combination of various special 
techniques and their intervention into human life.
In the first category is found the union of the two concepts, pro­
ducer and consumer. Although traditionally a distinction was made 
between them, planning brings them together. It is true that man is 
thereby restored to a certain unity, but the new reality takes in 
everything. All human functions are mobilized in the “production- 
consumption” complex. This restoration of unity is, in a certain 
sense, a step forward, for it holds that production and consumption 
are perfectly adapted to each other and that two correlative and 
interdependent functions may no longer be separated, as in liberal 
capitalism. But what in one sense restores unity represents in an­
other a circumscribing of the whole human being. To be in tech­
nical equilibrium, man cannot live by any but the technical reality, 
and he cannot escape from the social aspect of things which tech­
nique designs for him. And the more his needs are accounted for, 
the more he is integrated into the technical matrix. It may seem 
paradoxical to hold that man becomes technicized as his needs are 
respected. But technique itself teaches him that needs are not in­
dividual, or, put more exactly, that individual needs are negligible. 
What technique envisages as needs is social needs as revealed by 
Statistics. Technique can and will take into consideration only 
man s social requirements. O f course no one denies the existence 
of individual needs. But when all human forces are attracted by 
the labor of satisfying social needs, when these forces include edu­
cation, orientation, proper environment, and hygiene, when at the 
same time the goods necessary to the satisfaction of social needs 
are numerous and easy to come by while those satisfying individ­
ual needs are rare and hard to find, it is pure utopian abstraction to 
say that nothing prevents the existence of individual needs. On the 
contrary, human nature does. Technique entails socialization of
The Technological Society (2 2 5
needs because it takes only social needs into account. This explains 
why technical research is more and more compelled to act on the 
basis of objective criteria of value. The measure of value, which has 
been made objective, better integrates man into his economic con­
dition. A hierarchy can better be established when precise rules 
are specified which are based on the economic value of the human 
being.
A second category of technical actions that are addressed di­
rectly to man and modify him attests strongly to what has just been 
said. It is necessary to act upon the individual in his capacity of 
producer so as to make him contribute his small share in carrying 
out the plan— that part of the operation, negligible in itself but in­
dispensable to the whole, which technique has assigned to him. The 
operations of hundreds of workers depend with mathematical rigor 
on the work done by a single individual. The joint responsibility of 
all the workers subject to the same technique is rigorous. In the 
name of this common responsibility, it is binding on every worker 
to execute his task strictly with the kind of enthusiasm that calls for 
personal devotion. The technical means for compelling this devo­
tion are well known, from human-relations techniques to the differ­
ent kinds of propaganda: shock brigades, Stakhanovism, socialist 
rivalry, and so on. The study of these technical means lies outside 
our study of the economic sphere. But it may be noted in passing 
that they are closely connected with the technique of economics, 
which cannot be realized without them.
It is likewise possible to exert pressure upon the individual in 
his capacity of consumer. Roughly speaking, the problem here 
is to modify human needs in accordance with the requirements of 
planning. The constraints that operate on man as consumer are not 
as sharp and brutal as those which operate on him as producer. As I 
have shown, the “spontaneous” creation of social needs among al­
most all men in our time justifies the application of economic tech­
nique. But although planning must satisfy both needs and the tech­
nical data, it is not at all certain that the correspondence between 
the two will be perfect What is required then is a small adjust­
ment. After all, only social needs are in question here; there is small 
cause for us individualists to become upset. A sociological current 
is to be modified, but not the conscience of the individual. More­
over, should not the means to this end reassure us? The more tech-
TECHNIQUE AND ECONOMY226 )
niques develop, the more unobtrusive they become. The use of the 
police, or even more radical means such as famine, as in the first 
years of the Soviet Union, shows a certain technical deficiency and 
a want of tact
The necessary adjustments are effected through price manipu­
lation and public relations. (Psychoanalysis has shown the malle­
ability of needs under the influence of public relations.) The same 
influences are here at work on social needs as were operative in the 
liberal economy. The only difference lies in the orientation of these 
means and in the person who uses them. Scientific, willed utiliza­
tion systematically and definitely creates the economic man, who 
ultimately comes to be nothing more than the “needs-yield com­
plex.” But the human being no longer feels any particular distress 
at this, because the almost magical results of economic technique 
come from perfect adjustment. The man who suffered under capi­
talism because of its spasmodic fits and starts and its spiritual un­
satisfactoriness, the individuals who suffered under a Communist 
regime because of fear and restraint, find themselves released from 
suffering by this adaptation, when in either regime technique as­
sumes primacy. In both situations, man’s spiritual needs are par­
tially gratified by propaganda and, in both, technique demands 
active participation of him. It even requires of him that he become 
intelligent, the better to serve the organization and the machine. 
The stage in which the human being was a mere slave of the me­
chanical tyrant has been passed. When man himself becomes a 
machine, he attains to the marvelous freedom of unconsciousness, 
the freedom of the machine itself. A spiritual and moral life is re­
quired of him because the machine has need of such a life: no 
technique is possible with amoral and asocial men. Man feels him­
self to be responsible, but he is not. He does not feel himself an ob­
ject, but he is. He has been so well assimilated to the economic 
world, so well adjusted to it by being reduced to the homo economi- 
cus, in short, so well conditioned, that the appearance of personal 
life becomes for him the reality of personal life.
Thus, the development of economic techniques does not formally 
destroy the spiritual, but rather subordinates it to the realization of 
the Great Design. Henceforth, there is no more need for the hy­
pothesis of the economic man. The whole of man’s life has be­
come a function of economic technique. In its realization, technique
The Technological Society (227
itself has far transcended the timid hypotheses of the classical 
economists. Man knows himself to be more and more free, for 
technique has eliminated all natural forces and in this way has 
given him the sense of being master of his fate. The new man being 
created before our very eyes, correctly tailored to enter into the 
artificial paradise, the detailed and necessary product of the means 
which he ordains for himself— that man is I.

TECHNIQUE 
AND THE 
STATE
The ponderous economic organization described in the preceding 
chapter requires the formation of a political technique. Nothing 
else could administer the decisions of economic policy. T  am not 
speaking here merely of economic planning, to which the state 
alone can give a direction and a foundation. The whole of eco­
nomic technique is confronted by the following dilemma: either it 
receives from the state that sanction which alone can render it 
efficacious, or it must remain a mere abstraction, an offer without 
a taker. But who believes that such a noble edifice can remain an 
abstraction? There is, in any case, one agency which asks nothing 
better than to intervene: the state. But then the state itself will be­
come technique.
The Technological Society(2 2 9
The State's Encounters with Technique
Ancient Techniques. The state has always exploited techniques to 
a greater or lesser degree. This is not new. But the techniques of 
the state, corresponding to the limited functions of the state, were 
hitherto encountered only in limited domains. Let us consider 
briefly the techniques employed by the state on the eve of the 
French Revolution.
There was, first of all, a military technique. This technique rep­
resented even then a very advanced system. It had undergone a 
great development in many respects and it involved a loosening of 
the traditional rigidities. There had been much improvement, for 
example, in the art of fortification and, above all, in tactics. Logis­
tics, recruitment, and military hospitals had all experienced im­
provement. In my Memoire sur le recrutement, I have shown that 
the study of Le Tellier and Louvois on this subject fails because 
they confuse civil and military administration.
In logistics and related fields, France had experienced the high­
est development. Tactics made an extraordinary leap forward in 
the eighteenth century and became a technique of extreme preci­
sion under Frederick the Great. According to Frederick’s concep­
tion, battles were to be won through the execution of certain 
movements, with a minimum of combat and with minimal use of 
soldiers. Skill in position and movement would necessarily lead 
the enemy to surrender. According to Guglielmo Ferrero, economy 
of means and an almost guaranteed success were characteristics 
of this technique— already far advanced.
The French Revolution, however, brought about a decisive re­
gression in tactical technique through its introduction of popular 
armies and mass levies of soldiers. With the Revolution, tactics 
sank little by little into obscurity. Military strategy and its related 
services developed and gave rise to innumerable techniques; but 
tactical science remained inert. Thus, in modern wars enormous 
masses of human and material means are employed, and, more 
often than not, are sacrificed to a dubious outcome. To offset this, 
medical and supply services have at their disposal a vast apparatus
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE230)
that operates with great efficiency as a result of technical improve­
ments. (The American Army in 1944 was the most remarkable 
example of this.) Epidemics, for instance— hitherto the universal 
accompaniment of war— claimed no victims in the last two wars 
(with the exception of the year 1918-19). Military technique, 
taken as a whole and in its various forms, represents a very old 
technique which at the present is executed entirely by the state 
and devised by its employees.
A financial technique, corresponding to the financial function, 
had likewise evolved and by the time of the Revolution was al­
ready of great age and comparatively highly developed. In fact, of 
all techniques, financial technique had evolved most rapidly; it had 
already arrived at a stage at which no further improvement was 
thought necessary. Here, too, the state was the prime mover. 
Philip IV had initiated a number of financial techniques which 
were completed between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries. 
Among Philip's innovations were double-entry bookkeeping, budg­
etary management and forecasting, separation of the services of 
the Budget and the Treasury, and the theory of loan management.
The state, however, did not play an exclusive role in matters re­
lating to financial techniques. There were financiers who were also 
merchants and who used for their own ends a merchandising tech­
nique they helped to develop. But although the role of the state 
was not exclusive, it was decisive: it was in connection with the 
state that these techniques reached their apex. After the progress 
that had already been made, the system seemed scarcely suscepti­
ble of further development. Napoleon’s reforms were limited to 
certain trivial alterations and to restoring certain features which 
had fallen into disorder. By and large, financial technique remained 
what it had been. It is true that its objects (taxes) and its organs 
(administrations) were profoundly perturbed, but these two ele­
ments did not, properly speaking, represent financial technique, 
and the technique itself continued to give satisfaction up to the 
beginning of the present century, when a rational and general 
systematization began to penetrate this domain. But the technique 
itself was still so well articulated that it was and is very difficult to 
change. Everyone recognizes that it no longer squares with other 
techniques and that its influence is retardatory. But its very power 
of resistance shows the excellence of its mechanism. There are two
The Technological Society ( 2 31
necessary conditions for the initiation of a real change; the integra­
tion of the finances into the general economy, and the transforma­
tion of the concept of public finance. These are the problems that 
confront us at the moment.
The functioning of justice very rapidly produced a judicial 
technique, less certain and rigid than the financial technique be­
cause ideological and human factors have always played an im­
portant role in it. For this reason, judicial technique was never 
completely able to take over the law as a whole. A certain conflict 
continued, after the Roman era, between justice and technique and, 
in the period under consideration, this conflict seems to have be­
come fixed. I shall treat this problem in all its complexity later on.
An administrative technique corresponded to the administrative 
function. But this technique was much less clearly defined than 
the others I have enumerated. As in the relation between law and 
judicial technique, administrative technique represented an un­
certain area because of the human element. The state never pos­
sessed the means, during the course of history, to convert its wishes 
into techniques, that is, to make them efficient. Louis XIV assumed 
the tone of an absolute monarch, but he did not possess the practical 
means to make his subjects obey his will in any well defined way. 
He had neither police nor administrative cadres. All he could do 
was coerce a few persons and make examples of them. However, 
terror is only exceptionally a technical means. The whole French 
administrative system was based on mere empiricism. Napoleon 
was able to systematize the administration in a rational way and to 
create a technical organ. But there were still no means for securing 
efficient action. It is difficult to see how there could have been, in 
the absence of both material substratum and method. A very simple 
example of the material substratum is the means of communication. 
It was scarcely possible to have a technicized administration when 
orders from the central administration in Paris took at least eight 
days to reach Marseille. Every kind of local latitude was encour­
aged by such delay. As to method, it was not known how the ad­
ministration ought to act with respect to the persons administered! 
Only constraint by force was recognized, and even that was merely 
empirical. Likewise, the choice of the persons upon whom con­
straint was to operate was not made with any rational rigor.
Much more technical rules of organization and administrative
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE33a)
action began to appear toward the end of the nineteenth century; 
they formed the content of administrative law. The concepts of 
public function, of centralization and decentralization, and so on, 
began to assume more precise outlines. But these concepts still 
represented a mere theory. Out of it, however, emerged the tech­
nical improvements necessitated by the very existence of great 
masses of people. But the actions dictated by this theory still 
offered a very great latitude of choice. There was no certainty as 
to which method was really the most efficient because experimenta­
tion was possible only on a very limited scale. In this theoretic 
domain, all choices and all arguments were still possible. Ad­
ministrative law was still not radically and indisputably the best 
system. It may be said, therefore, that at the beginning of the 
twentieth century administrative technique did not yet exist.
Finally, the state fulfilled a political function, a function of 
general direction into which all the others were combined and 
which addressed itself to foreign as well as to domestic affairs. 
But on the eve of the Revolution this political function was in its 
infancy. There was no political technique of any sort; "secret di­
plomacy” could not possibly have been called a technique. Policy 
was delivered over to the whims of a Minister of the Interior, or an 
ambassador, or a Chamber of Deputies, or a dictator. There was 
nothing but flair, personal ability, special interest, routine. Political 
theories never gave rise to any realistic practical application, only 
to bad copies of historical situations and to political circumstances 
which had to be endured with fortitude. In spite of the frequent 
mention of Machiavelli's Prince, the truth is that until the beginning 
of the twentieth century no one ever drew the technical conse­
quences of that work. What existed, then, was a kind of original 
chaos in which the umu of genius always outclassed his adversar- 
ies because they never had at their disposal a technique which 
sufficed to redress the balance. The beginnings of a political 
technique had to await the appearance of Lenin. And even Lenin’s 
political technique in many respects had to be based on certain 
other techniques which he did not hava.at his disposal; for example, 
techniques for obtaining scientific knowledge of the masses and 
the modes of action applicable to them, techniques of temporal 
and spatial co-ordination, techniques of strategy, and social tech-
TheTechnologicd Society (2 3 3
niques on a global scale. All these are only today in the process of 
being elaborated.
The most important technical activity of the state remained 
completely empirical until the beginning of the twentieth century. 
Nevertheless, the state did press into service a certain number of 
other techniques which we have already examined. However, the 
techniques used by the state had one characteristic in common: 
all of them were limited both in their objects and in their means. 
They referred to particular questions and did not extend beyond 
the framework of the particularities. Moreover, they were merely 
co-ordinated and were only sporadically applied. Nevertheless, 
there were, in the immense field of state activity, certain technicized 
points which offered some degree of permanence. Whatever real 
relation these sustained to one another was effected by the organism 
common to them all, the state.
New Techniques. The state was fated sooner or later to come into 
contact with other methods. Since the end of the eighteenth century 
it has gradually encountered all techniques and finally the technical 
phenomenon itself. From the political, social, and human points of 
view, this conjunction of state and technique is by far the most 
important phenomenon of history. It is astonishing to note that no 
one, to the best of my knowledge, has emphasized this fact It is 
likewise astonishing that we still apply ourselves to the study of 
political theories or parties which no longer possess anything but 
episodic importance, yet we bypass the technical fact which ex­
plains the totality of modern political events, and which indicates 
the general line our society has taken much more surely than some 
painful revival of Marx ( who was not acquainted with the techni­
cal fact) or some spiritualistic theory. These so-called “explana­
tions” are mere utopias and flourish only as utopias flourish.
This ignorance of tire technical phenomenon springs perhaps from 
an obdurate traditionalism which causes us always to live in the 
past and explain the present without understanding it. Thereby, 
our grasp of social events lags by half a century. Or it may spring 
from an unconscious repression. We simply will not to see whatever 
is too difficult for us to bear or whatever bulks too large for our 
understanding. However the case may be, it is striking to note 
that such political thinkers as Max Class interpret the facts of the
TECHNIQUE AND TIE  STATE234 )
present by means of concepts that date from the turn of the 
century. At best, they talk about “technical barbarism" without 
taking into account that such terms do not represent anything 
real and that the term barbarism in this domain can only come out 
of the decadent society of igoo. If one quits this kind of tradi­
tionalism, one falls straightway into an extravagant metaphysic, 
such as that of the Jesuit Father Teillard de Chardin, which has no 
more substance.
We take it, then, that in the present century the state has en­
countered the technical phenomenon in a far different framework 
from the traditional. How has this encounter been effected? There 
are a multiplicity of causes. We shall not concern ourselves with 
general causes such as the diffusion of ideas, demography, national­
ism and colonialism, the influence of finance on the state, and so 
on. All these factors are well known and are dealt with in numer­
ous textbooks. We shall apply ourselves here to those causes which 
stand in direct relationship to technique.
The first cause is the rapid extension of techniques formerly em­
ployed only by individuals into domains which the state had never 
before penetrated. Among these techniques were those of trans­
port, education, aid to the helpless and indigent, and even spiritual 
techniques (as represented by the Congregation “de Propaganda 
Fide” or the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola). The use of 
these techniques had two effects: on the one hand, they produced 
clearer and more distinct results so that they attracted the attention 
of the state; and on the other, they allowed a considerable exten­
sion of the field of activity to which they were applied. For exam­
ple, they were able to reach the masses of men. But the moment 
they proved themselves able to operate efficiently on the masses, 
they ceased to be purely private. The state could no longer remain 
disinterested.
When instruction was imparted by a few masters on the Pont 
des Arts, or in a small number of episcopal colleges, there were 
only a handful of students— and de minimis non curat praetor.l By 
the time the technique of organization and pedagogy permitted 
the creation of the university, however, the state’s attention was
A Roman legal maxim: “The praetor [the state] has no concern for trifles.*’ (Trans.)
TheTechndogical Society ( 2 3 5
inevitably attracted by this much more grandiose phenomenon. It 
was impossible for the state not to feel directly concerned, espe­
cially when in the eighteenth century certain ecclesiastics such as 
Jean-Baptiste de la Salle aspired to make education free and com­
pulsory by way of a new pedagogy which could be directly ad­
dressed to all children.
Put another way, these techniques, because they were applicable 
to the masses, allowed individual persons to transform their sphere 
of activity from a private to a public one. These techniques seemed 
designed for this very purpose. And to the degree that their in­
fluence increased, they had to come into contact with the state 
itself, since they collided with the fundamental principles of state 
power. In any case, the private persons who had developed these 
techniques gradually ceased to be able to utilize them because 
they came to exceed the possibilities of any individual. When ap­
peal was not made to the state, it was necessary, for their exploita­
tion, to set up organisms as vast and powerful as the state itself. 
Thus, trusts and corporations were rendered necessary by the 
technical apparatus. This occurred even in the absence of the 
profit motive, after wealth had become incommensurable with the 
individual and therefore abstract. The prime purpose of state or 
corporation might even be to rob and despoil the individual by 
the exploitation of these techniques. I repeat that it could not have 
been otherwise. From a certain degree of development onward, 
every technique concerns the collectivity of men.
It would be unthinkable for us today to leave in private hands 
really efficient instruments such as atomic energy. In 1949 a report 
was presented to the Congress of the United States emphasizing 
the fact that the study and production of atomic energy must re­
main in the public domain. It would likewise be unthinkable that 
a private citizen have the radio at his disposal in order to unleash 
a campaign of agitation on a world scale. In every country the 
radio is at least under the supervision of the state, whether it is 
under direct state control or in private hands. No matter how 
liberal the state may be, it is obliged by the mere fact of technical 
advance to extend its powers in every possible way.
The second cause of the interrelation of state and technique is 
directly related to the first; the application of techniques is ex-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 3 «)
tremely expensive. Whatever realm we survey, we note that it 
becomes gradually impossible for personal or familial capital, how­
ever concentrated, to answer technical requirements.
Modern research in nuclear physics implies that the state must 
pay the bill No private person could support the cost of cyclotrons 
and their auxiliary apparatus. Once a certain degree of technical 
progress has been achieved, continual improvements give rise to 
instrumentation so complex and large that the cost price is inacces­
sible to the individual. The present growth of cost price in all 
technical domains is unparalleled, even in recent history. The pub­
lic has gained some faint conception of this through the prices of 
some of the recently discovered “wonder drugs” such as strepto­
mycin. But it fails to realize the magnitude of the growth of other 
cost figures. For example, one hour of flight in a B-17 bomber (com­
parable to the larger commercial passenger aircraft) cost 60,000 
francs in 1944. The B-36, which replaced the B-17, cost 400,000 
francs per flight hour in 1950. There is a comparable growth in the 
cost of the machines themselves. The B-17 cost 120 million francs; 
the B-36, 1 billion 600 million. These cost prices, officially recog­
nized in 1951, have been far surpassed. Thus, the prototype of the 
B-52 cost, on the day of its commissioning, 40 billion francs. An 
analogous growth of cost price applies to all techniques. The prices 
indicated are virtually the same for commercial aviation, equipped 
with the latest technical improvements. Private companies no 
longer exist which are able to support such expense. A blast furnace 
for a modern steel plant costs 8 billion francs; a hot rolling-mill, 
12 billion; a cable mill, 7 billion. Altogether, a plant capable of 
producing a million tons of steel annually requires a primary in­
vestment of 125 billion francs. It is impossible not to appeal to the 
state to make up with subventions the insufficient resources of 
private enterprise. We have already noted the alternative: the slow­
down of technical progress occasioned by private capitalism. Such 
a slowdown would be regarded as intolerable, and could not last 
very long.
The problem has nothing to do with debates about “nationaliza­
tion.” No more relevant is the allegation that the state frequently 
applies techniques with “less ability” than private enterprise, or that 
it “wastes money.” What I am emphasizing here is that the prin­
cipal menace to capitalistic individualism is not some theory or
The Technological Society ( * 3 7
other, but technical progress. T o take another example, it is clear 
that, as city-planning techniques develop, they will give rise to
more extended and precise urban research, to urgent reconstruc­
tion plans, and to a new and completely indispensable conception 
of the city. It is impossible to go on indefinitely contemplating 
these plans on paper; a technique must be applied. The only ques­
tion is: who shall apply it?
Electrical networks may remain for some time independent of 
one another. But this situation cannot last when it is found that 
independence gives rise to general costs of no inconsiderable 
magnitude, difficulties in arranging the courses of the lines, and 
even practical difficulties in electrical technique. The interconnec­
tion of electrical networks is demanded by all technical men. 
Again, the only question is: who will execute it? And it is immedi­
ately clear that only the state is in a position to do so. The problem 
is even more acute when it is a question of the interconnection of 
the lines of several nations, not merely the domestic lines of a single 
country. (An international European network is already pro­
jected.)
Whatever the area of interest, problems are raised by technology 
which demand technical solutions but which are of such magni­
tude that they cannot be solved by private enterprise: for example, 
pollution of water supplies and of the urban atmosphere. These 
phenomena, which have assumed such proportions that they 
threaten the whole of city life, are of purely technical origin. Only 
rigorous and authoritarian measures of general control can solve 
these problems if they are to be solved at all That is to say, appeal 
to dictatorial state action is indispensable.
These problems all exceed the powers of private individuals. 
Technique, once developed to a certain point, poses problems that 
only tire state can resolve, both from the point of view of finance 
and from that of power.
The third cause of the interrelation of state and technique is the 
transformation of the role of the state and of its conceptions of its 
role. The state takes on increasingly extended and numerous ac­
tivities. It considers itself the ordainer and preceptor of the nation. 
It takes charge of the national life and becomes the nation-state. 
The phenomenon of the nation-state has appeared as a result of 
the coincidence of a variety of circumstances upon which it is
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE238)
useless to insist here. Let us simply note, first, that the state seeks 
to organize national life and to govern its various collectivities, 
most often because natural communities have disappeared and it is 
necessary to create new ones. Second, the state seeks to fashion the 
“individualist” society (the role the twentieth century has elected 
to play) and to penetrate into men’s private lives on the ground 
that they are no longer able materially to manage their own af­
fairs. Finally, all kinds of theories, both socialist and nonsocialist, 
are influential; but, whatever their nature, they all appeal to the 
state to secure a greater degree of justice and equality. In all these 
ways the state assumes functions which were formerly the province 
of private groups. And in performing these functions, the state 
encounterstechniques hitherto employed by individuals.
When, for example, the state takes charge of education, it en­
counters two technical elements originally developed by private 
persons: a complete educational organization and a pedagogy. The 
state, in taking over any activity, encounters the techniques of that 
activity and sees its technical potential augmented thereby. The 
augmentation of potential reciprocally brings the state into closer 
relation with the technique. Nowhere is this relation clearer than 
in the economic field. When the state establishes itself as producer 
and consumer, it enters the older domain of exploitation by indi­
viduals. It is confronted with a complete technical system the 
broad outlines of which have already been drawn and focused. 
But basically the state enters this domain because productive and 
economic techniques, the development of which we have already 
studied, render such action indispensable. Thus, we have a two- 
way street: technical development inevitably brings about state 
intervention in the economic world; and, reciprocally, when the 
state intervenes it finds a , technical apparatus which it develops 
further.
The economy, to a greater or lesser degree, conditions the creation 
of the nation-state. Alternative explanations— political and intel­
lectual— are given for the creation, let us say, of the Fascist state. 
But the most profound cause of this phenomenon was the economic 
impasse in which Italy and Germany found themselves. The 
nation-state was primarily a response to the cessation of economic 
evolution. That there were other causal factors is clear, but we are 
seeking to locate the central cause. The problem of the adaptation
The Technological Society (239
of the whole of society to the economic movement in all its ramifi­
cations is not to be solved by economics alone. It is a technical 
problem. The economy, with its enormous productive capacity, 
volume of trade, mobilization of society, and economic techniques 
which thirst to be applied, is no longer a closed circle, a single 
activity among others. It engages the life of the whole society and 
of all men in it
Economic problems are now problems of the whole of society. 
The relation between the economy and all other human activities 
can no longer be merely empirical. Liberalism sufficed for the 
economy of a century and a half ago. Today it has no meaning. 
No economic theory is eternally valid; every period demands its 
own. The problem of the adaptation of society to economy (and it 
is in this sense rather than in the inverse, traditional sense that the 
problem must be posed) is a technical problem. That is to say, the 
problem has a solution only in a certain arrangement, through 
the mediation of the social apparatus and social mechanisms. This 
supposes an adaptative intervention having as its object the whole 
of society and conscious of end and methods. Only a superior 
power, limited by nothing and possessing all instrumentalities, is 
in a position to proceed to this adaptation. This is what will bring 
about the mobilization of all means by the state; in our day it is 
completing the encounter between state and techniques which was 
already necessitated by the other factors we have studied.
Private and Public Techniques. The techniques first developed by 
individuals and later on encountered by the state present very dif­
ferent characteristics from those of traditional political techniques. 
In their origin and development they manifest the following traits:
1) They are better perfected and better adapted than the 
techniques of the state. They represent the inspirations of individu­
als acting out of personal interest or for those higher motives we call 
vocation. In either case the individual devotes himself to his task 
wholeheartedly and with passion; such a devotion is rarely to be 
found among the creators of state techniques. There genuine en­
thusiasm is found only for very limited periods. Thus, the councilors 
of Philip IV, the prefects of Napoleon, the Nazi Ftihrer, the 
people’s commissars of the Soviet Union alone seem to have been 
capable of rivaling the ardor and technical devotion of free workers 
who have made technical progress. Isolated individuals working for
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE240)
personal motives seem to display more imagination. When the same 
problems are posed simultaneously to the state and to individuals, 
the individuals are usually the first to find the correct method and 
solution. Whenever it has been of importance to secure acceptance 
for some brand of goods, doctrine, product, or action, private per­
sons (businessmen or religious groups) confronted with the same 
necessities as the state have tended to respond much more rapidly. 
The Church created propaganda; later, private commercial in­
terests created publicity. The state and its propaganda came in a 
poor third. Even then, it was private persons who applied propa­
ganda long before the great systems of Lenin and Hitler. In France 
the Maison de la Presse inaugurated efficient propaganda opera­
tions in 1916. In England, a private organization, The Central 
Committee for National Patriotic Organization, performed the 
same function. Commercial interests found the most efficient prop­
aganda methods by exploiting the discoveries of psychology and 
psychoanalysis.
In the private creation of techniques there is a very great di­
versity of methods. No one acts in accordance with a general 
schema. The individual always lives a much more realistic and real 
life than a collectivity, especially the state. The individual con­
siders the problem as it really exists in its individuality and, as a 
consequence, seeks the method that represents the best solution. 
The state, on the other hand, acts on masses of men and on 
multiple problems, and it is inevitably drawn to schematize and to 
deny the complexity of problems. As a result, it is unable to dis­
cover the technique best adapted to their solution. This is why 
techniques created by individuals yield the best output and are 
better adapted to their objects, why they are techniques in the 
truest sense. We discover the same thing in the following fact: 
the individual possesses only limited financial resources and cannot 
allow himself the luxury of waste and excess. When he seeks the 
solution of a difficulty, expense is a factor. He must find the least 
costly mode of action; thus, he is brought around to economy of 
means, a characteristic of true technique which we have already 
examined. Corroboration of this is found even in domains which 
concern the state directly. Thus, the mechanization of state ad­
ministration is a result of experiments made by private banking 
houses since 19x4 and by German industry since 1926. Only around
The Technological Society (241
1940 did public administration begin to apply the “new” principles. 
The state rarely discovers and applies any true techniques, for the 
simple reason that it has too much power and too many financial 
resources for its agents to seek out economy of means— the first re­
quirement. Its methods are, generally speaking, ponderous and ex­
pensive and require an enormous apparatus to secure mediocre 
results. Its results are obtained, in fact, through the sheer enormity 
of the means employed rather than through their technical quality. 
(This is evident today in the French insurance industry.) The pri­
vate person, on the other hand, is constrained by pecuniary neces­
sity to develop true techniques. This also applies sometimes in the 
case of a poor state. Such was the case in the Third Reich. Another 
factor operated in favor of private persons throughout the nine­
teenth century: capitalistic competition. Then techniques had not 
yet produced machines and methods exceeding human possibili­
ties; it was therefore mandatory to employ the most efficient tech­
niques so as not to be crushed by the competition. Technical im­
provement usually conferred substantial competitive superiority. 
This favored an acceleration of private technical progress right up 
to the time when it was no longer possible for the finances of 
private entities to keep pace with technical progress.
2) Techniques elaborated by individuals were the result of 
specialization, which operated at first in the scientific domain but 
which was introduced into the technical world before long. 
During the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth centuries, 
specialization was conducive to the development of different tech­
niques along very divergent lines. Every technical branch operated 
independently of the others. Few or no relations existed among 
them. There was no organ to co-ordinate their efforts. (The situa­
tion was very different with the techniques of the state. Through 
the co-ordinating effect of the state’s political function, as we have 
noted, these techniques had a certain degree of co-ordination 
among themselves.) But it mattered little whether private tech­
niques were or were not co-ordinated, since the majority of them 
had as their end money profit, not the improvement of society. 
Every individual found his own way to success. This specialization 
produced very advanced techniques with which to deal with cir­
cumscribed problems in certain areas but it left large areas barren 
and unexplored. This led to the impression, up to about 1930, of
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE242)
a certain incoherence and of an extraordinary inequality of de­
velopment; it also led to the common error, which still persists, 
that technique and machine are identical. Undoubtedly it is this 
dispersion of technical operations that allows certain writers to 
deny that they are dealing with a technical society. These super­
ficial observers do not deny that certain areas of society are affected 
by technique; but they assert that inumerable factors are inde­
pendent of it. This is a backward view of things, based on tradi­
tional conceptions of society and completely removed from reality. 
But it is true that co-ordination of the different techniques has 
still not been completed; and wherever they remain in private 
hands they tend to remain specialized and unco-ordinated. How­
ever, technical co-ordination is rapidly being extended, and it is 
becoming less and less possible to speak of areas into which tech­
nique has not penetrated.
3) The techniques created by private individuals, contrary to 
those of the state, rarely slacken their pace. They are in constant 
forward movement and progressively affect all spheres of human 
activity. This has taken place only in the twentieth century, but it 
was always of the essence of private activity that its techniques 
had expansive power.
We have already studied the step-by-step development of priv­
ate techniques. It must in justice be added that private activity has 
also been conducive to technical generalization. When in the past 
the state created its techniques, it was satisfied with them as they 
were and made no attempt at further progress, although this is no 
longer the case today. However, private activity has never wearied 
of the struggle, particularly since it has become necessary to exploit 
all possibilities in order to survive. The population explosion, for 
example, has encouraged the proliferation of private research. Sud­
denly there were too many people. It was impossible to employ all 
the new workers, and even industrial production could not absorb 
the extra manpower. It became a matter of prime necessity to dis­
cover new industries and to utilize new work forms. Technique 
proved to be just the right means for exploring the possibilities. 
The extension of the factory system, along with technical applica­
tion in certain new domains, was the (unconscious) means of 
employing the surplus workers. Simultaneously, however, it pre­
cipitated crises of unemployment. (The two facts are intimately
The Technological Society ( 243
related.) Thus, techniques rapidly came to be employed every­
where to a certain extent They have taken over not only all work­
ing life but also man’s diversions, which have been transformed into 
industrial enterprises. Very soon man himself became the object of 
technique, a mere means to the end of profitmaking. Among the 
most notable techniques developed and applied in this area are 
public relations and human relations, which have as their goal to 
associate, adapt, and integrate the human individual into the tech­
nical milieu in such a way that he will not suffer from it.
Private initiative, then, took the decisive step in the application of 
techniques to man. State action could never have brought this to 
pass. The state was too content with its coercive power to apply 
precise techniques.
The Reaction of the State to Techniques. When, as a conse­
quence of the circumstances we have studied, the state comes into 
contact with the techniques elaborated by individuals, when it 
encounters a private sphere of action which techniques have trans­
formed into a sphere of public interest, it reacts by taking over this 
sphere as well as the techniques which brought about the mutation.
Sometimes the state enters a field of action for very different 
reasons than the ones I have so far mentioned. The state will adopt 
techniques simply because it finds them already functioning. How­
ever evident this fact may be, it is necessary to emphasize it; to 
neglect it is to occasion many misunderstandings. The state will 
not act otherwise than as individuals have already acted. Insurance 
companies have developed insurance techniques; when these com­
panies are nationalized, the state retains the old mechanism. After 
all, there are only a limited number of ways of using actuaries or 
establishing a police force. When an automobile manufacturing 
enterprise passes under state control, the tempo of the operations 
and the assembly line are not modified. This is particularly clear 
with regard to material techniques, because techniques seem to us 
the more constraining the more they are material. But, in fact, im­
material techniques display exactly the same characteristics.
W hentheF rench Revolution tried to suppress the systems of edu­
cation and of charities that the old regime had established through 
the efforts of private persons, the attempts miscarried lamentably. 
The effort to create a system of public assistance (hospitals and 
homes for the elderly, for abandoned children, and for the poor)
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 4 4 )
and a system of state education was a major enterprise of the Con­
vention and of the Constituent Assembly. But these systems were 
failures. Excessive systematization and theoretical precision some­
times represent the exact opposite of a good technique. In these 
instances, the state encountered an organization which was indeed 
imperfect but which was, after the technical improvements of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, very nearly sufficient. Con­
fronted by these institutions, the state, for theoretical reasons, set 
out to destroy and to re-create on paper systems of education and 
of public assistance which corresponded to the theoretical deci­
sions and doctrines of the Convention, although they turned out to 
be neither efficient nor technically sound. (In the realm of educa­
tion, the state sought to break the power of the Church and estab­
lish a wholly laicized system. In public assistance, the state set the 
concept of justice in opposition to that of charity and desired to 
give its support only to citizens.) The new systems, unfortunately, 
were never able to function. With the Directory and the Consulate, 
a backward movement set in. The revolutionary innovations made 
with such difficulty were repudiated and the techniques that had 
preceded them were restored. The university and the colleges were 
reorganized in nearly the same way as the schools of the eight­
eenth century. The pedagogical system created by the Jesuits was 
restored; hospices and hospitals were reconstituted as they had 
been before the Revolution. And since it was difficult to secure 
new specialized personnel, the old personnel, monks and nuns, 
were restored to duty. The great difference was that now all the 
institutions were under the control of the state. But although they 
functioned as organizations belonging to the state, they were in 
fact identical with the earlier private organizations. The arbitrary 
creations of the Revolution having failed, it was necessary to use 
already existing technical creations.
The same phenomenon appeared in the realm of finance under 
the Third Reich. Hitler’s revolution claimed to have done away 
with all the classical methods of finance; it wanted to be revolu­
tionary in the management of nationalized enterprises, in the or­
ganization of commerce and monetary relations, and even in finan­
cial technique. Insofar as National Socialism was a party, it 
emphasized the struggle against capitalism. Feders program pro­
vided for a complete transformation of economic and financial life;
The Technological Society (245
manipulation of money, prices, and wages would lead to the dis* 
appearance of capitalism, and to this end completely new financial 
forms were recommended. But, little by little, financial necessity 
in its most traditional form reasserted itself: to accomplish reforms, 
money was needed. In 1938 Schacht reaffirmed the old position 
that only the orthodox financial technique of capitalism was capa­
ble of furnishing the funds necessary to the Nazi state. Rejection 
of inflation, short-term financing, refusal to use currency for financ­
ing— all thesewere traditional principles of financial technique. The 
financial machinery of the Third Reich was nearly identical with 
that of the Empire in 1914. All this is characteristic of the sub­
mission of state and revolutionary doctrine to enemy principles 
through the effects of techniques, which, when they are efficient, 
are necessarily common to both. In essence, the Nazis turned from 
technically untenable inventions back to an efficient financial tech­
nique, a technique identical with the one that dominated in the 
capitalistic countries and in the Soviet Union. At a given moment 
and in a given framework, there are only a limited number of tech­
niques for attaining a given result.
The technical phenomenon is not modified when an organization 
passes under state control. According to Simone Weil, this explains 
why a system of industrial rationalization, which ought normally 
to develop into socialism, in fact can only exacerbate the worker’s 
condition. Fourastie agrees (perhaps involuntarily) when he 
writes: "If technical development has been intensive, then, what­
ever the nature of judicial conditions, profits, unearned income and 
even political regime, there has been improvement in consumer 
purchasing power. This is the essential source of the social progress 
brought about by the last century and a half.” This amounts to 
saying that technical progress breaks down all barriers and tech­
nique imposes its structures and social progress. This forward 
motion of technique is a constant, whatever the variables of the 
question may be.
The state cannot modify technical rules; and should it attempt 
to do so for doctrinal reasons, it suffers an inevitable setback. For 
this reason, the transition of the economy to state control can create 
only state capitalism, not socialism. Socialism implies the suppres­
sion of the state. (We shall see further on what it implies with 
respect to technique.) Insofar as the state continues to exist, noth-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE246)
ing prevents it from calling itself socialist, but in reality nothing 
has changed. It is only a sleight-of-hand trick to say that the same 
institution with the same rules, applied in the same way and having 
the same results, is socialist when it is at the service of the people 
and capitalist when it is at the service of capitalist institutions. 
What does it mean to be at the “service of the people”? Such an 
expression can only designate the service of a state which calls 
itself socialist, although it does not proceed democratically from 
the people. But what does it mean to be socialist under these con­
ditions? It means to be at the service of the people. We are going 
around in a circle. One of the gravest symptoms of our times is 
that technique has little by little emptied socialism of any con­
tent. Beyond evident facts— such as the relation of Stakhanovism 
to Taylorism, or the identity of police methods in the Soviet Union 
and in Fascist countries— a major example is the persistence of the 
capitalist’s so-called “surplus value” (in reality, profit) in socialistic 
regimes. The financial system of the Soviets is based, to the extent 
of 80 per cent, on the difference between wages paid to the work­
ers and the value of their product. This profit, which the socialist 
regime professes to have eliminated, has actually been extended. 
The only difference is that it goes into the coffers of the state in­
stead of the corporation’s cash box. But in capitalist regimes the 
corporation tends to become a public entity. Mikoyan, in his speech 
of October 17, 1953, declared: “Capitalist commerce has certain 
technical features that we ought to study. By reason of competition 
and the difficulty of attracting customers, capitalist countries have 
developed exact methods of commercial organization These ought 
to be applied in those areas of the Soviet Union where they are 
likely to prove efficient.”
I could go on and show that all technical rules and institutions 
are identically reproduced in the socialist state. This means that 
there are no longer any specifically1  socialist institutions. Nor are 
there any adminisrative or economic organizations which are pe­
culiarly the result of socialism. The socialist state, because it is 
efficient, has been obliged to adopt the technical principles of 
capitalism. Hence, in order to distinguish the socialist situation 
from the others, socialism always falls back on that vaguest of all 
concepts, teleology. Capitalism, it is said, has regard only for itself; 
it seeks but to preserve itself. Socialism, on the other hand, is a
The Technological Society ( a47
constructive force on the march. But nothing warrants the belief 
that the means employed will result in socialism. Teleology can 
only create a stir for a short time as an instrument of propaganda; 
but it is far from certain that such propaganda can give character 
to socialism, which more and more is losing its specific reality as 
a result of technique.
The state, by taking possession of all technical spheres and in­
strumentalities, becomes of necessity a capitalist state, substituting 
itself for private capitalists. And when it has come to understand 
its real interest, it adds nothing and modifies nothing that, techni­
cally speaking, pre-existed. When the state realizes the use it can 
make of techniques, when it understands the usefulness of tech­
niques in all spheres, it moves deliberately to appropriate them.
In the past (and to a certain degree today), circumstances led 
the state to appropriate a given technique. The fortuitous develop­
ment of some political trend, the encounter of technique with the 
state— these led the state, a bit haphazardly, to adopt a technique. 
But instances of premeditated action on the part of the state in this 
direction are beginning to be discernible; for example, the exploita­
tion of propaganda and atomic research. We must expect this 
movement to gain greater and greater amplitude, for when the 
state has once undertaken some action, it generally goes on to the 
end.
Repercussion* on the State
The conjunction of state and technique is not a neutral fact. For 
many it is not surprising and implies nothing but a growth of state 
power. They ask whether, after all, it is not a good thing that the 
state perform its functions as well as possible and be well equipped 
to this end. We have indeed known a state which had only a 
laughable police force, powerless and incapable of checking crimi­
nals. It is a good thing for technical progress in this sphere to 
collate all other techniques, thus enabling the state to perform its 
role of arresting crime. These techniques, when utilized by the 
state, enable it to restore order, to guarantee certain liberties, and 
even perhaps to master its political destiny. This is how current 
opinion interprets the conjunction of technique and the state. I be-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE* 4 8 )
lieve that such attitudes are superficial and inaccurate. Technique, 
in its present state of development, is no longer merely a passive 
instrument under state control, as it was under the control of cer­
tain individuals. The question now is what we see when we ex­
amine contemporary facts instead of antiquated principles. 
Evolution. The first consequence of the conjunction of state and 
technique is the progressive transformation of the old techniques of 
the state after they have come in contact with the new techniques—  
formerly private but now becoming public. When a comparison 
is made between private and public techniques, it is noted that 
private techniques are incomparably more efficient. (I have al­
ready indicated certain reasons for this.) To the extent that tech­
niques remain private, they lie outside the framework of the state. 
When they come under state control, however, the question in­
evitably arises why these techniques should not be incorporated 
into the traditional framework of the state. But private techniques 
seem to have been created to answer different requirements; they 
have different dimensions, and this poses a problem. Private meth­
ods are intimately connected with their objectives, and these of- 
jectives are of human dimensions. Consequently, they are not 
adaptable to the much more extended needs of the state. This in­
compatibility ceases to be true, however, as private business begins 
to assume dimensions equal to and sometimes greater than those 
of the state. It is clear that enterprises such as Citroen or Bata 
are of such dimensions that their administrations are comparable to 
the administration of the state. Standard Oil has international in­
terests of such magnitude that its international policy is like that 
of a state. The financial power of the Insurance Trust is such 
that a parallel can be drawn between its financial system and that 
of a stale. It appears that, starting with a certain critical mass, 
sociological and technical laws are identical for private and public 
enterprises.
We may exclude from the technical framework states such as 
Luxembourg and San Marino. And we may soon be forced to ex­
clude nations which do not prepare themselves quickly enough to 
face up to technical demands, such as Belgium, Holland, and Den­
mark. These three have already been obliged to combine in order 
to meet modern technical problems. European nations in general 
are being compelled to renounce political sovereignty and form
The Technological Society (*49
associations designed to realize certain far-reaching technical op­
erations, as, for example, research projects in atomic energy (1958), 
the exploitation of the Sahara (1958), the launching of an artificial 
satellite (i960). Conversely, we must include in the technical 
framework the great private enterprises, whose technical princi­
ples are identical with those of the state. Indeed, it may be said 
in general that the state lags behind the great corporations in this 
respect and that it is compelled to modify and rationalize its ad­
ministrative, judicial, and financial systems on the model of the 
great commercial and industrial enterprises. This is the point that 
Hrant Pasdermaidjan makes in his book about the government of 
great organizations. He shows in particular that all administra­
tions— civil or military, state or industrial— must rest on identical 
principles of technical organization if they would be efficient. If 
these principles are not followed, the administration is condemned 
to being overtaken and passed by private enterprises. In this re­
spect, France is alarmingly backward. Because our administrative 
and financial system was the world's best a century ago, we care­
fully persist in maintaining it, whereas the plain truth is that cer­
tain techniques would guarantee much better results. Even our 
newly created administrations, such as Social Security, refuse to be 
guided by well-known technical rules. This is not the case in the 
so-called progressive countries, in which the administrative and 
financial systems are aligned very rapidly (too rapidly, perhaps, 
when the social order is not on the same plane as the technical or­
ganization ) with industrial and commercial techniques.
This new organization of administration results in part from the 
creation of a technique of administration and in part from the in­
troduction of the machine into all organizations. The two are re­
lated, not only because mechanization entails, as I have already 
pointed out, a reorganization of administrative units but also be­
cause mechanization solves the major problem of administration, 
the problem of paper work. All organizations are founded on paper 
work. And when paper work transcends human capacities by virtue 
of sheer quantity and complexity, the problem of what to do about 
it arises. The machine is the solution.
To get some idea of the magnitude of this mechanization, let us 
consider the two over-all categories of office machines, accounting 
and statistical. The first category is divided into seven major types
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 5 0 )
and their subdivisions. The second is divided into four types and 
fourteen species. The operations effected by these machines in­
volve a modification of the administrative structure: administra­
tive tasks must comply with mechanical requirements. Mas says 
that “the operations cannot be carried out except by breaking them 
down into homogeneous tasks and functions so that they can be 
committed to mechanical organs.” The operations may be grouped 
by cycles as a function of the end sought; or they may be brought 
together into a single task combining all operations of the same 
technical nature. This last is the so-called functional grouping, 
which results in an administration divided into “performance func­
tion,” “arrangement function,” “interpretation function,” and “con­
trol function.” It is easily seen how far removed all this is from 
the traditional type of office and from the customary division of 
administrative tasks.
What is true in administration is also true in finances. The tradi­
tional principles of public accounting, such as the separation of 
the funcions of comptroller and accountant, the control of monies 
paid out, etc., have clearly been affected. A tremendous leap was 
necessary for the Cour des Comptes, twenty years in arrears with 
its inspection of finances, to deliver in 1948 the results for 1944 
and 1945. The guiding principle of finance today is that security 
is sacrificed to speed. Finance no longer represents, as it did in 
the nineteenth century, the rule, the criterion, and the check. It 
has become the instrument of an efficient general policy. It must 
never act as an obstacle to a decision which is technically valid. 
Its traditional role as a check and constraint has been rendered 
questionable through the adoption of new techniques in imitation 
of private enterprise.
The financial regime of a modern state is highly reminiscent of 
commercial affairs. The rules of accounting are modified by the ap­
plication of business machines, for example, punched-card ma­
chines. Here machine intervention directly voids an older ad­
ministrative technique. A certain flexibility is necessary but is 
rarely found in state structures, which are, for various reasons, 
rigid. Nothing less than revolution brings about the adaptation of 
political regimes to the technical improvements which have be­
come mandatory as a result of private enterprise. This is only a 
corollary of what I have been saying— namely, that political moti-
The Technological Society (251
vations do not dominate technical phenomena, but rather the re­
verse. The state is usually unable for doctrinal reasons to revolu­
tionize the techniques of public finance. But when technical 
progress makes this revolution mandatory, the state is obliged to 
capitulate.
This is clear enough with respect to army, police, administra­
tion, and finance, but it is perhaps less clear with respect to law. 
Here is one of the major problems contemporary jurists ought to 
be considering; but all too often they waste their time in textual 
subtleties. The judicial regime is simply not adapted to technical 
civilization, and this is one of the causes of its inefficiency and of 
the ever greater contempt felt toward i t
Law is conceived as a function of a traditional society. It has not 
registered the essential transformation of the times. Its content is 
exactly what it was three centuries ago. It has experienced only a 
few fragmentary transformations (such as the corporation)— no 
other attempts at modernization have been made. Nor have form 
and methods varied any more than content. Judicial technique has 
been little affected by the techniques that surround us today; had 
it been, it might have gained much in speed and flexibility.
Faced with this importance of the law, society passes to the oppo­
site extreme and burdens administration with everything that is the 
product of the times in the judicial sphere. Administration, because 
it is better adapted from the technical point of view, continually 
enlarges its sphere at the expense of the judicial, which remains 
centered on vanishing problems such as codicils, community re­
versions, and the like. These last, and all similar problems that are 
the exclusive concern of our law, are problems that relate to an 
individualistic society of private property, political stability, and 
judicial subtlety.
Law is radically vitiated by its backwardness. We ought to be 
concerned not only with making laws but with rediscovering judi­
cial principles that might possibly put into some kind of order the 
constructions made necessary by modem technique. All the tradi­
tional legal principles are collapsing; for example, the principle of 
the nonretroactivity of laws or that of the personality des delits 
et des peines. This is not due to the particular evil of our society, 
but simply to the fact that the law, insofar as it is a system, is not 
adapted to absorb necessary innovations. This is the resistance to
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE35a )
social upheaval of a long-tested and traditional technique. And in 
the judicial sphere, unlike the others, there is no fund of private 
experiment to render it more efficient. As I have pointed out, priv­
ate experiment remains the principal source of the advance of 
technique, even when technique has passed into the hands of the 
state.
Another striking example of this is found in pedagogy. Educa­
tional method was stabilized after the state nationalized education 
and adopted the Jesuits’ technique. But the pedagogic movement 
dating from the turn of the century is at present rendering the 
whole edifice questionable. The older framework was coherent, but 
the combined technical discoveries of psychologists, physicians, 
and educators have given birth to a new system which is progres­
sively penetrating the educational milieu. The state is moving in 
the direction of these discoveries. It has created the so-called new 
classes, which do not yet correspond exactly to the principles of 
modern pedagogy but which do represent the first step of integra­
tion into the body of the state of a method worked out by private 
persons. Once again we see the traditional techniques of the state 
being modified by the influence of private techniques, subject to a 
certain lag and to difficulties that result from the enormity of the 
operations, which concern not a few individuals but millions.
The Technical Organism, A second consequence of the penetra­
tion of the state by techniques is that the state as a whole becomes 
an enormous technical organism. Thus, nationalization of certain 
industrial plants not only makes the state an industrial “boss” or 
technician, but also compels it to revise its techniques of organiza­
tion and administratioa Indeed, in Great Britain, France, and 
even the United States the dimensions of the newer industrial or­
ganizations of the state far surpass those of private enterprise. We 
are witnessing the creation of technical bureaus of a new character 
and the creation of hitherto unknown types of organizations de­
signed to redistribute power internally on the different levels. All 
this, unbeknown to the public, doubtless produces repercussions 
on the structure of the state, the effects of which are decisive but 
will only make themselves felt some years hence. It may be added 
that these changes are much more widespread in Great Britain 
than in France.
In order to gain some conception of the full range of techniques
The Technological Society (*53
applied by the modem state, consider the following enumeration 
of techniques which lie outside the traditional domains already 
examined:
Industrial and commercial techniques of all orders (the state be­
coming state-boss to an ever greater degree)
Insurance and hanking techniques, including social security, 
family allotments, and nationalized hanks
Organizational techniques, including co-ordinating commissions 
among all services, and new inspection systems 
Psychological techniques, including services of propaganda, vo­
cational guidance, and psychotechniques 
Artistic techniques, including radio, television, a more or less 
official motion-picture industry, city planning, and controlled tour­
ism
Scientific techniques, including the various centers of scientific 
research
Planning techniques (with arbitrary objectives), including gen­
eral economic planning, transport planning, and city planning 
Biological techniques (already a reality, although rare), includ­
ing human stud-farms, euthanasia, obligatory vaccination and 
medical inspection, and social assistance 
Sociological techniques (for the management of the masses and 
the study of public opinion)
Each of these comprises various subsidiary techniques, complex 
mechanisms, and specialized methods. The state, since it applies 
these methods where necessary, can itself no longer be anything 
other than technical. Persons who become panic-stricken before 
such administrative proliferation and aggrandizement of state ac­
tivities, who criticize social security, for example, because it em­
ploys too many civil servants, who hold that a return to liberalism 
would suppress this proliferation, show thereby that they have not 
understood the development of modern times. No deliberate choice 
on the part of the state, no theoretical decision, has brought about 
this growth of technique; its causes were independent of the per­
sonal or collective. The modern state could no more be a state 
without techniques than a businessman could be a businessman 
without the telephone or the automobile. The businessman does 
not employ these objects because he is particularly enamored of 
progress. The state does not employ propaganda or planning be-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE254 )
cause it is socialist The circumstances are such that the state can­
not be other than it is. Not only does it need techniques, but tech­
niques need it  It is not a matter of chance, nor a matter of 
conscious will; rather, it is an urgency which expresses itself in the 
growth of the technical apparatus around a rather slight and feeble 
“brain." The motive force behind the state does not develop in 
proportion to the state apparatus. This motive force ( theological 
interpretations aside) is man. And man has no more capacity to 
function when he is at the center of the technical organization than 
when he is a simple citizen lost in the machinery. In other words, 
the politician is demoted to minority status by the enormity of the 
techniques the state has at its disposal The state is no longer the 
President of the Republic plus one or more Chambers of Deputies. 
Nor is it a dictator with certain all-powerful ministers. It is an 
organization of increasing complexity which puts to work the sum 
of the techniques of the modem world. Theoretically our politi­
cians are at the center of the machinery, but actually they are being 
progressively eliminated by it. Our statesmen are impotent satel­
lites of the machine, which, with all its parts and techniques, ap­
parently functions as well without them. The state machine is, to 
be sure, not yet well adjusted, but we are only at the beginning, 
and its adjustment is already good enough to give the unmistakable 
impression that it will tolerate no outside influence.
I know there are some who believe the political factor to be 
predominant. These people will cite the sovereign authority of men 
such as Stalin, who for political reasons modified the technical or­
ganization by excluding certain techniques and retaining others. 
Some will cite the authority of Hitler, which was exercised for 
doctrinaire, not technical reasons. In these cases, and in many 
others, it would seem that politicians make real political decisions 
which coerce and determine the technical machinery. Were this 
true, the state would not be primarily technical. But we must not 
be taken in by appearances. Gabriel Ardant has clearly shown that 
today the search for efficiency is the law of the state’s administra­
tions and services. Where purely administrative technique is not 
the chief goal, government is no longer possible. It is not sufficient 
to improve one or another governmental service, or to create iso­
lated new organisms. The whole structure and methodology must
The Technological Society (2 5 5
be considered; in this process the politician does not count for 
much.
The Conflict Between the Politicians and the Technicians. The 
intrusion of techniques into the machinery of the state involves the 
conflict of politicians and technicians. “Let the technicians speak” 
is a leitmotiv of all the journals of the opposition. Dardenne, in his 
Trots mots chez les paysans noirs, concludes his African inquiry by 
noting the necessity of allowing the “era of the technicians to suc­
ceed the era of authoritarian administrators.” He sees in this the 
solution of all the human problems of the Negro peasantry. For ex­
ample, he contrasts the political decisions of administrators to build 
barracks and strategic military roads with the technical decisions 
of agronomists and economists to develop the African cotton in­
dustry and to furnish cheap cotton goods to the natives. But 
Dardenne overlooks the fact that the first decision was not made 
by politicians, but technicians: the military. He holds too firmly 
to the idea that technician means engineer. He neglects the tech­
nical character of both the army and the air force, and sometimes 
even of the administration.
This oversight, which is widespread, often leads to a misinter­
pretation of certain well-known conflicts of interest. In 1938 many 
people insisted that there was hostility between the Nazi Party and 
the technicians (and even the army). But this “conflict” came to 
nothing, unless it was the attempt on Hitler— which was made in 
1944 after his power had been effectively broken. A. Ciliga and 
Stolypine report that a similar situation exists in the Soviet Union. 
According to Ciliga, alongside the Communist bureaucracy which 
holds the political power through its mass organizations and labor 
unions, there is a “technical intelligentsia,” the ITR, which is 
strongly organized and nonpartisan and which has created its own 
corporative organization. All technicians belong to the ITR, and its 
role has become more important in proportion as the economic 
structure is increasingly based on the activities of technicians. The 
five-year plan implies a technical framework without parallel. An 
alleged conflict exists between the Communist Party and the ITR; 
the ITR seeks to turn out the Party on the grounds that the Party 
(a) hampers technical development, (b) provokes discontent 
among the workers, and (c) intrudes into its decisions certain
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*56)
motives which the technicians cannot accept. R is possible that 
such a conflict exists. Certain signs suggest it The Communist 
Party’s fear of the saboteur is doubtless not just propaganda. But 
there are not enough signs to enable us to form a judgment.
Moltchanowski presents another aspect of this alleged conflict. He 
writes of a class of very bureaucratic and backward technicians, 
incapable of modifying their methods to adapt them to technical 
developments. Preoccupied with the realization of the plan, they 
ignorantly increase the number of workers or the hours of work, 
instead of increasing efficiency. The insistence on the old methods 
of work paralyzes the new mechanical means and diminishes yield 
even further in view of the magnitude of the labor force employed 
in the upkeep of equipment. The problem then becomes: Who 
ought to take responsibility for adapting the worker to the ma­
chine? Who is to educate the worker? The answer is: the local 
branches of the Communist Party.
The complexity of the elements of this conflict is evident; and 
it is difficult to accept without reservation the image of the tech­
nician-archangel sallying forth to do battle with the megalomaniac 
and rotten politician. Nevertheless, it is probable that in the Soviet 
Union, as in Nazi Germany, there is a conflict between the two 
classes. But this conflict cannot be counted (hi to bring about a 
change in the regime. As C. Wright Mills has shown, the managers 
under any regime whatsoever are never anything but executive 
agents. They are never in a position, publicly or institutionally, to 
assert themselves against their masters. Conversely, the masters 
become totally powerless without the complex (and secretly all- 
powerful) managerial cadre.
In democratic regimes, there is indeed a conflict between politi­
cian and technician, but it is apparently much less acute. Two 
questions arise. First, how does it come about that the conflict is 
greater in the dictatorships? Second, how does it come about that 
the technicians do not take the upper hand in a democracy and 
overwhelm the politicians, who possess no serious means of resist­
ance? The answer to the second question enables us to dispose once 
and for all of the idea that there is a natural and inevitable hostility 
between politicians and technicians. As for the first question, there 
is an easy reply: in a dictatorship the politician is more demanding 
and makes his weight felt more heavily, so that the technicians find
The Technological Society ( 2 5 7
his decisions rather difficult to tolerate. But then how to explain 
the fact that dictatorships make the most of the technician, sub­
mitting everything to his judgment and integrating everything into 
the technical system? How to explain the fact that the ITR takes 
its meaning from the five-year plan, the plan itself being a product 
of politicians? How to explain the prodigious technical rise of the 
Soviet Union and Nazi Germany under the sway of the politicians? 
The orientation of both these regimes was technical. Why do the 
technicians complain?
The answer is that the conflict is not between politicians and 
technicians but among technicians of different categories. In the 
dictatorships, the politician aims, successfully or unsuccessfully, to 
comply with the demands of a political technique. In democratic 
systems, the politician complies only with the requirements of a 
technique for getting himself elected; he has an altogether inade­
quate grasp of the various technical services. He has no direct 
relation to any of the innumerable technical activities. The politi­
cian in a dictatorial system, on the other hand, tends to become a 
technician and ipso facto collides with other techniques.
The new political technique claims to be concerned with aU 
techniques, indeed to effect a synthesis among them. Synthesis is 
very likely its real function. But synthesis cannot be achieved at 
the first attempt, and the claim is not easily accepted by the other 
technicians. We are witnessing a crisis of adaptation. Political 
technique is far from realization; it is only in its first stammering 
stages. Yet it claims to be the science of synthesis, as did theology 
in the Middle Ages or philosophy in the eighteenth century. When 
the engineer protests against the politician’s decisions, he may be 
justified on the grounds that the politician is deceiving himself and 
in reality is quite ignorant. But the engineer may also be ignorant 
of the technical motives behind the politician’s decision; the en­
gineer has no conception of the elements necessary to judge politi­
cal technique on the plane of synthesis. This is indeed a crisis of 
adaptation; but precisely because adaptation is involved, the con­
flict does not lead to the overthrow of the regime.
A similar crisis, practically speaking, does not exist in democratic 
systems where the attempt to form a political technique has just 
begun. The English, however, have wanted for a long time to in­
troduce technique into governmental operations and thus to resolve
as8 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
conflicts between politicians and technicians before they become 
acute. Since the eighteenth century the English have been pre­
occupied with the technique of lawmaking. In the nineteenth cen­
tury, with Arthur Seymonds and Bellanden Ken, their express goal 
was the rationalization and systematization of legislative opera­
tions. Their motto was: Codification, Consolidation, Purification. 
Their technical reforms resulted in the creation of offices for the 
technical editing of legal projects, in uniformity of method, in the 
use of marginal notes, and in the editing of resumes and tables. 
This effort has been resumed in the last few years in Great Britain 
on the ministerial level; to be able to compete with the techni­
cians, the politicians have undertaken governmental reorganization 
on the Cabinet level, with a view to greater efficiency. They have 
divided up their work systematically by developing numerous so- 
called “standing committees,” each of which has its rigorously de­
fined specialty. The co-ordination of these committees is assured 
by the Cabinet Office, an organ of great originality. The cabinet 
office consists of a small group of highly trained civil servants under 
the direction of a permanent secretary. Its function is to prepare 
the agenda of the Cabinet and its committees and to take minutes 
of the meetings. It is interesting to note that the importance of this 
office is growing. The technical function which it assumes gives 
it a kind of supremacy over the whole political complex.
Similarly, the United States has shown a desire to establish a 
truly independent corps of political technicians as opposed to poli­
ticians, and to separate completely the political organ of decision 
from the technical organ of preparation. The task of the expert is to 
furnish the politician with information and estimates on which he 
can base a decision. A clearly defined division of responsibility 
corresponds to this functional division: that is, the expert has no 
responsibility. The problem is, above all else, to maintain the in­
dependence of the technician; he must avoid pressures, involve­
ment in contests of influence, and the personal quarrels of the 
members of the administration. When the technician has completed 
his task, he indicates to the politicians the possible solutions and 
the probable consequences— and retires.
Unfortunately, the Americans do not consider the inverse prob­
lem, which is, objectively speaking, becoming more important 
When the expert has effectively performed his task of pointing out
The Techndogicd Society (2 5 9
the necessary ways and means, there is generally only one logical 
and admissible solution. The politician will then find himself 
obliged to choose between the technician’s solution, which is the 
only reasonable one, and other solutions, which he can indeed try 
out at his own peril but which are not reasonable. At such a moment 
the politician is gambling with his responsibility since there are 
such great chances of miscarriage if he adopts technically deviant 
solutions. In fact, the politician no longer has any real choice; deci­
sion follows automatically from the preparatory technical labors. 
Jungle even claims that in the United States, on very advanced 
technical levels, unchallengeable decisions have already been 
made by “electronic brains” in the service of the National Bureau 
of Standards; for example, by the EAC, sumamed the “Washington 
Oracle.” The EAC is said to have been the machine which made 
the decision to recall General MacArthur after it had solved equa­
tions containing all the strategic and economic variables of his 
plan. This example, which must be given with all possible reserva­
tions, is confirmed by the fact that the American government has 
submitted to such computing devices a large number of economic 
problems that border on the political. Even admitting that we are 
not yet at this stage, we must recognize that every advance made 
in the techniques of inquiry, administration, and organization in 
itself reduces the power and the role of politics.
Consequently, the opposition between technicians and politi­
cians places the politician squarely before a truly decisive di­
lemma. Either the politician will remain what he is in a democracy, 
in which case his role is fated to become less and less important in 
comparison to the role of technicians of all sorts ( a state of affairs 
already evident in the financial sphere); or the politician will take 
the road of political technique, in which case the crisis of adapta­
tion will inevitably arise. If the politician really wishes to continue 
to exist, he must choose the second solution as the only possible 
one. The existence of techniques in all other spheres forces him to 
this choice. Even so, little by little he is being stripped of any real 
power and reduced to the role of a figurehead. These tech­
niques entail for him both the possibility and the obligation to 
devolve a political technique. This does not mean dictatorship, 
which is a provisional, trial form. It means, as we shall see, an 
inevitable and radical transformation of the political perspective,
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE260 )
The Nazi dictatorship and Stalin’s regime ought not to be com­
pletely identified. I have already stated that Lenin was the first 
man to create a political technique. For Lenin— and Stalin under­
stood this in a remarkable way— the politician was neither a 
theoretician nor a chief of state in the traditional sense, but a 
technician.
Lenin’s concept makes politics a technique like the others, but 
actually superior to them since it is basically charged with co­
ordinating the other spheres of activity. Political decisions are 
taken by virtue of technical motives, and it is this fact which dif­
ferentiates this kind of politics both from the purely doctrinaire 
Communism of the left and from the older opportunism that makes 
its decisions on the basis of subjective motives, impressions, and 
reasonings bearing on the immediate situation and varying with 
circumstance. When Stalin modified a given organization or 
changed the content of a plan, he did so not underpressure of facts 
but as a function of facts, by applying a precise technique. Of 
course, it is possible to apply the technique badly; certain errors 
may persist because the technique has not yet been fully de­
veloped. But the important thing is that the politician is forced to 
follow the line laid down by the technician. This is the tendency 
which has become classical in Communism. According to this 
tendency, Marxism is not a doctrine but a method, a method of 
thought as well as of action. This political technique is not well 
understood and may not even be recognized— above all because 
its ends are not clear. Is it directed toward Communism as a whole? 
Or must the distinction be made, with Lenin, between strategy 
(which is indeed directed toward Communism) and tactics (rep­
resenting the more specifically technical part, in which immediate 
political problems are resolved in relation to strategy). Tactical 
decisions are all made rationally to satisfy all possible technical 
data arising from all co-ordinative bureaus and organisms. The 
distinction between strategy and tactics enables us to understand 
the most sensational zigzags of the party line; for example, the 1937 
stand against the older Communism, the 1940 pact with Nazism, 
the admission in 1943 of the Church into the Communist frame­
work, the 1947 stand against “formalism,” that of 1949 against the 
authors of the plan. These tactical changes can all be explained on 
the basis of technical reasons of great precision; they do not repre-
The Technological Society (261
sent arbitrary decisions of hard-pressed politicians. The growing 
influence of technicians was further emphasized in 1953 by the 
selection of five technicians to be the five vice-presidents of the 
Council of Ministers.
The problem, posed by Hitlerism was very different. Hitler was 
a politician who made his decisions without the advice of techni­
cians, and often even despite their advice. His decisions were moti­
vated by subjective, internally generated impulses. This attitude 
was the more extraordinary in that the Nazi apparatus appeared 
to be among those which had best understood and applied the 
fusion between state and technique. It utilized all techniques to the 
maximum possible degree, reducing them unconditionally to its 
service, with the exception of the borderline case of politics. Even 
so, it is not always correct to assume that politics intervened hap­
hazardly. Very often, the firmest doctrines of Nazism had to 
yield to technical necessities. Thus, the Nazi propaganda tech­
nique twice resorted to actions which were publicly popular but 
which were at the same time completely contrary to Nazi doctrine. 
One such instance was the great propaganda drive of 1935, at the 
time ot the "confirmation” plebiscite: "We are more democratic 
than the democracies.” The plebiscite was intended to show that 
the Fiihrer was the true incarnation of the people and that, conse­
quently, the Nazi regime was a real democracy, not an artificial 
one, as France’s was. The second instance was the great propa­
ganda campaign in behalf of liberty: “We are defending the 
liberty of European man.” These two themes, widely used but 
formally opposed to the Hitler doctrine, arose from the technical 
necessities of propaganda. It is also known that the financial tech­
nique of the Nazis often led them to act contrary to doctrine; for 
example, in the case of Jews who were made "honorary Aryans,” 
or in the case of certain capitalists who became mainstays of the 
regime and were integrated into the financial organism of the 
Third Reich. However, the personal political decisions of Hitler 
frequently did upset the techniques of the state. The conflict was 
particularly keen between Hider and the general staff; but it also 
existed with the Geheim Polizei and with the organs of foreign 
trade. Hitler ordered the adoption of certain measures the tech­
nicians disapproved, and after the fall of Nazism, they blamed 
every difficulty and misfortune on these arbitrary decisions. In any
262 )  TECHNIQUE AND TH E STATE
case, it can certainly be said that the majority of Hitler's personal 
decisions were unfortunate, notably from the military point of 
view.
It is clear that the future belongs not to Hitler’s kind of political 
action but to Stalin’s. Some important political chieftains may still 
bypass these techniques; but their situation appears more and more 
precarious.
In the conflict between politician and technician, corruption is 
a much more serious matter. Political milieus are very generally 
corrupt The fact is indisputable, both in democratic regimes such 
as France and the United States and in authoritarian systems such 
as Fascism, Francoism, and Nazism. We cannot really speak about 
the Soviet Union. The vertigo of power and the opportunity to 
become rich corrupt politicians very quickly. To the degree that 
the state becomes more and more technical, there is increasing 
contact between politicians and technicians. Though technique 
tends more and more to have primacy over politics, and technical 
decisions seem unassailable by parliaments, the takeover of tech­
nique Can be arrested by corruption. The technician is a man, and 
in contact with corrupt men he may well allow himself to be cor­
rupted. He can sidetrack his technique, annul the decisions de­
manded by its strict application, and grant some favor or special 
privilege which perverts technical action. In such an instance, 
general interests (the only true objects of politics) no longer con­
trol technique; particular interests (which are much more efficient 
in checking technical action) do. Pure technique represents the 
general interests, the true politics, and is opposed to the politician 
who represents the corrupting element for private, and hence 
politically nonexistent, reasons. The corruption of politicians is the 
only factor which can retard the total transformation of the state 
into a gigantic, exclusively technical apparatus. Even so, the im­
petus of this movement of transformation is being intensified; and 
public opinion is oriented towards its success. Public opinion, which 
counts for a great deal even in authoritarian regimes, is almost 
unanimously favorable to technical decisions as opposed to politi­
cal ones, which are usually described as either “partisan” or “ideal­
istic.” One of the current reproaches made against politics is that 
it fetters the normal activity of techniques, which the public gen­
erally considers good in themselves. Citizens become angry, for
TheTechnologicalSociety ( 263
example, when they see the state holding back the development of 
aviation. In case of a conflict between politician and technician, the 
technician has public opinion behind him. A characteristic instance 
was furnished by Spain. Spanish Fascism ought clearly to have 
been censured by the democracies in 1945, as was Italian Fascism. 
There were political, sentimental, and doctrinal reasons for doing 
so. But the military technicians proclaimed that this would be a 
disaster, and the economic technicians agreed. The United States 
and Great Britain let Franco survive, and France was ridiculed 
for closing the frontier. Public opinion, which, particularly after 
ig44, was sharply anti-Fascist, ought to have reacted favorably to 
this action of the French government. Indeed, the first impulse 
was to condemn Spain. But after the technicians had shown that 
such a move would be harmful economically and financially (on 
the plane of foreign commerce), public opinion began to shift. A 
callous comparison was made between an ideological action, a 
noble gesture which yielded nothing, and the judgment of the 
technicians, who were demonstrating the stupidity of such an 
ideology. Public opinion wavered for a time, only to turn, after 
about six months, in the direction of the technicians.
Can it be said that this was a matter of personal interest? The 
overwhelming majority of Frenchmen had no direct interest in the 
matter; yet, it ought not to be forgotten that adherence to a tech­
nical decision is always a matter of personal interest. As for the 
technicians, it may be asked why they made the judgment they 
did. Clearly because they were applying their technical instru­
ment, in which generous or sentimental motives had no place. The 
technicians as technicians told us that the closing of the frontier 
was disastrous; as men, they might have approved of the action 
for ideological reasons. It is not at all certain that technicians are 
still capable of making humane judgments; that, however, is an­
other question.
The transformation of the state and the consequent predomi­
nance of technicians involves two elements. First, the technician 
considers the nation very differently from the politician. For the 
technician, the nation is essentially an affair to be managed, for 
(righdy) he remains imbued with the private origin of technique; 
as a consequence, the private and the public spheres are poorly 
delimited. All that the technician can take into account is the ap-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE264)
plication of his instruments— whether in the service of the state or 
of something else is of small importance. For him, the state is not 
the expression of popular will, or a creation of God, or the essence 
of humanity, or a modality of the class war. It is an enterprise with 
certain services which ought to function properly. It is an enter­
prise which ought to be profitable, yield a maximum of efficiency, 
and have the nation for its working capital.
The influence of the technician on the state does not reside solely 
in the conditions he imposes through his administrative decisions 
or in the schema of good organization he draws up. It resides also 
in the judgments he makes concerning governmental and adminis­
trative efficiency. I have discussed the transformation of the system 
of public accounting. A new and remarkable example of this is 
furnished by the Netherlands. The problem there is to evaluate the 
efficiency of governmental services as a function of their cost 
prices. Every organization, we are told, must in principle establish 
a valid relation among men, ends, and means in respect to their 
productive efficiency. Productivity, which seemed heretofore to be 
a purely economic concept, has made its appearance in the last 
few years in the political framework. It is necessary to evaluate 
the cost of every administrative operation and to apply the law of 
marginal yield. Funds are assigned to each department on the 
basis of a standard cost established through service. By introducing 
modern double-entry bookkeeping, it is possible to carry out a 
constant inspection of activities on every level and to establish the 
relation between actual and standard expenses. In this way, the 
law of the technician transforms the administrative perspective. 
Every administration becomes an object, as formerly the worker 
became an object in Taylor’s hands. Politics assigns the goal; but 
the technician dictates the means to the last dot. We have a detailed 
description of this orientation in Gabriel Ardant’sbook.
The entire administration is only a machine whose operations 
must become more and more rigorous. In this way, that ideal theo­
retical situation is attained in which, to use the words of James K. 
Feely, Jr, the “margin of chance between intention and realization* 
is almost nil. For, according to Feely, the smaller this margin be­
comes, the more a check on execution appears possible, and the 
more the coefficient of predictability is increased. Such a situation 
would give maximum security in all the different administrative
The Technological Society ( 265
units, and what Feely proposed as a theoretical ideal becomes prac­
tical. The only price tag on its attainment is the conversion of the 
administration into an apparatus, the civil servants into objects, 
and the nation into a supplier of working capital.
The nation becomes the object of the technical state in that it 
furnishes all the different kinds of material substratum: men, 
money, economy, and so on. The state becomes a machine de­
signed to exploit the means of the nation. The relation between 
state and nation is henceforth completely different from what it 
had been before. The nation is no longer primarily a human, geo­
graphic, and historical entity. It is an economic power whose re­
sources must be put to work, and to which a “yield” must be re­
turned. In connection with this yield, the older technicians used 
the term maximum but the newer ones use the term optimum. 
Maximum yield is yield that exhausts and debases the resources 
of the state in a short interval of time; optimum yield is yield that 
attempts to safeguard substance and vitality, the typical example 
being the TVA. However this may be, we must regard the nation 
as an entity whose total resources are to be brought into action 
precisely because all the different techniques, mutually condition­
ing one another, have come into play. Once the technician has 
commenced his operations, he cannot recognize any limits. He 
cannot esteem or respect anything in the nation except the “nature 
of things.” This promotes the greater coherence of the state-nation 
which is so characteristic of our times.
What is true on the national level is also true on the level of 
international organization. In view of the radical setbacks experi­
enced by the political organisms designed to foster international 
agreement, it was decided to entrust further exploration along these 
lines to a group of technicians. It was believed that international 
consideration of the areas to be exploited, rather than purely na­
tional interests, would be more propitious to an entente. Thus, in 
1949 a great assemblage consisting of 550 scientists and technicians 
opened its deliberations at Lake Success to consider how best to 
exploit the world’s natural resources. International projects of this 
kind are much less advanced than similar intranational projects, 
and the reactions of politicians to the technicians are correspond­
ingly more enthusiastic. This was evident at the 1949 Strasbourg 
assembly of the Organisation Europ6enne de Cooperation fico-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 6 6 )
nomique, a purely technical group. The Americans were of the 
opinion that this organization did not progress as quickly as the 
technical situation permitted. We are witnesses at the inception, 
on the international level, of the same "takeover” by the technicians 
which we have already observed on the national level.
The second element implied in the transformation of the state 
and the predominance of the technician is the progressive suppres­
sion of ideological and moral barriers to technical progress. The 
old techniques of the state were a compound of purely technical 
elements and moral elements such as justice. The moral elements 
are not completely negligible even today, although they by no 
means occupy the place of honor accorded them in official dis­
course. The techniques employed by private persons are usually 
techniques in a pure state, and contain no admixture of moral ele­
ments. (We shall see later on that this is no random fact, but the 
result of the very nature of technique.) The state is charged not 
only with maintaining respect for law and order but also with 
establishing just relations among its citizens. It therefore imposes 
limits on the pure technique of private persons. Thus, from the 
beginning, the liberal state forbade the free manufacture of ex­
plosives and substances pernicious to health. On a higher plane, it 
struggled by means of antitrust laws (as in The United States) 
against the trust, an economic organization notorious for social 
injustice. It also established labor legislation limiting the abuse of 
the workers by mechanical techniques. In the area of justice, the 
state has been a barrier and a check against private technical 
abuses. But when technique became state technique, when techni­
cal instrumentalities passed into the hands of the state, did the 
state adhere to its old wisdom? Experience must answer in the 
negative. The techniques, to which the state opposed checks when 
they were in the hands of private persons, become unchecked for 
the state itself. There is no self-limitation in this respect.
The English state forbade traffic in narcotics but made wide use 
of them in India and China. An omnipotent state, Fascist or Com­
munist, ceases to respect laws made for the protection of labor. 
(The Communist state proclaims this to be a provisional solution 
pending the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat; 
but we can make no judgment of future events.) This is not merely
The Technological Society (267
a case of princeps legibus solutus est3 but something much more 
profound. The state is the only barrier between men and the 
techniques of individuals, but it ceases to be a barrier when tech­
nique, increasing geometrically, encounters the ancient raison 
d’etat.3 This last, which perhaps has nothing to do with the nature 
of the state, has nevertheless existed almost continuously through- ' 
out history. But the raison detat never possessed the means to 
express itself. It operated sporadically and incoherently and its 
decisions often miscarried. It remained more an intention than a 
reality but was always latently there. Primarily, it represented the 
justification by the state of itself. It was the negation of morality 
by the state. But the means at the disposal of the state were them­
selves subject to a strong moral influence. They were consequently 
neither technically nor morally adapted to the raison d’etat, which 
was deprived of any force without these arms.
The French Parliament under absolute monarchy, or the French 
administration under the Restoration, for example, were not 
adapted to this objective. But when new techniques refined the 
old ones, the old ones lost their internal curbs. The state then found 
itself in possession of means agreeable to the raison d’etat. As soon 
as it had these means, it applied them without hesitation because 
it entertained no doubts at all as to the excellence of its ends. At 
the same time other techniques, the result of the activity of indi­
viduals and until then restrained by the state, came into the hands 
of the state, which well understood their usefulness for realizing 
its constant objective. How could the state be expected not to 
exploit a judiciary without independence and a police without any 
faculty of judgment? But the most noteworthy fact in this compli­
cated development is that henceforth the raison d'etat could only 
be the expression of the multiplicity of techniques which it had 
employed to realize itself.
Technique and Constitution. French administration remained, un­
til about 1940, as Napoleon had created it in 1800. It had, of 
course, undergone certain modifications in detail; there had even 
been certain reversions to pre-Napoleonic practices. But no serious

changes had taken place either in orientation or in structure. 
Constitutional monarchy, monarchy with absolutistic tendencies, 
bourgeois and socialist republics, the Empire— these French re­
gimes all accepted or suffered Napoleon’s instrument because it 
was a good one. There is no doubt that one of the gravest prob­
lems of the Third Republic, if one seldom explicitly considered, 
was that an administration created by and for an authoritarian 
state should be in the service of a state which wished to be thought 
liberal. This is the situation of the state today in all areas. Only 
with difficulty can the technical apparatus be varied; only with 
difficulty can it be employed in one way rather than in another.
To take a simple example: it matters little, in driving an automo­
bile, whether the regime be republican or Fascist. Techniques are 
becoming less and less material, and really important differences 
from state to state tend to fade progressively away. A given state 
technique must be exercised on its own terms, though the political 
opinions of successive ministers differ. This continuity can be ex­
pressed in terms of the dictatorship of bureaus. It explains the 
often-noted fact that socialist ministers, once in power, act in all 
countries very much as did their nonsocialist predecessors. This 
is the result not of so-called Marxist treachery or of weakness of 
character, but of the specific weight of techniques. Ardant, in his 
book on the technique of the state, emphasizes that there is a tech­
nique of state that no regime, whatever its nature, can do without.
Every statesman is faced with the dilemma, either he must apply 
these techniques on their own invariable terms, or he must re­
nounce them and forego the results they tend to produce. We 
must not lose sight of the fact that techniques furnish the best 
possible means, each in its own sphere. A country's economic min­
ister will be forced to plan the economy or abandon it to anarchy. 
We have already studied the unfeasibility of a half-planned econ­
omy or of planning which contents itself with making recommenda­
tions. Technique will not tolerate half measures.
What is true of a political personality— a minister, for example—  
is in part true of a political regime. It makes little difference 
whether or not the constitution provides for a separation of powers, 
for one or more chamber, or for a democracy on the model of East 
or of West. From the technical point of view the results will be 
very nearly the same. Any type of administration other than that
The Technological Society (189
which is technically the most efficient is impossible. A  different 
financial regime is also an impossibility. In the case of taxes, for 
example, it is said that a rightist regime will favor indirect taxes 
that bear hardest on the general population because this popula­
tion represents the "masses,” but that a socializing regime will 
favor direct taxes that bear hardest on the great fortunes. This only 
shows that a scientific tax technique is not being applied. It seems 
incontestable that such a rigorous technique, in view of the yields 
it can produce, will in the end carry the day. There is an optimum 
tax structure which can be completely determined. It gives the best 
yield to the state, and at the same time equalizes the fortunes of 
the citizens and saves the fiscal substance. There is no valid reason 
for not implementing it. This optimal system is making headway 
in all states and is gradually overcoming the associated and ad­
ventitious ideological motives.
In the same way, planning imposes itself little by little on every 
regime. It is ideologically puerile to profess to see differences be­
tween Soviet and Nazi planning. Planning is not reserved to au­
thoritarian states. Democratic states which tend toward socialism, 
such as France or Britain after 1945, or nonsocializing democratic 
states such as Denmark, today employ the system of planning. 
Even states which are completely liberal, such as South Africa, are 
engaged in planning. This does not mean that the whole economy 
is necessarily planned; it means that the technique of planning is 
making headway even in political systems unfavorable to it  
Whether it is a question of an immigration plan, an export plan, a 
transport plan, or a city-planning operation, the same technique 
is involved.
Planning is being extended to all domains of political life as well 
as to all state regimes. In 1951, Chancellor Adenauer declared 
that German youth had not responded to the efforts of the regime, 
that the youth were anarchic and disorganized, that it was impos­
sible to have any hopes for them, and that planning represented 
the sole means of reintegrating this wayward youth into the Ger­
man community. He announced that a German Youth Plan was 
being elaborated to cope with the necessity of bringing youth into 
rigid organizations, giving youth an ideal and a collective soul, 
discipline and a fixed way of life. Adenauer went on to say that 
all this had to be planned. In a way, he was suggesting a return
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE270)
to totalitarian methods. Fiance in 1952 took steps to provide plan­
ning for scholarships and tourism. In 1956 it planned youth or­
ganizations, and in i960 sports. It is to be noted that planning is 
becoming more and more widespread in the United States, where 
there is a tendency to apply it not only to economic problems but 
also to social (for example, city planning) and political questions. 
Indeed, American planning is becoming a basic element; it is no 
longer an accidental fact or a mere adjunct. In the United States 
there are nearly two thousand planning organisms in the service 
of the various states, not to mention national organisms, some of 
which are public (The Council of Economic Advisors) and some 
private (The National Planning Association).
We must not lose sight o f the fact that nations are more and 
more closely connected. Moreover, when one nation engages in 
planning, there is an inevitable repercussion on the others; they are 
more or less obliged to engage in planning too. And the planning 
of one element implies first the understanding, then the mastery of 
many others, and little by little the planning of these others. It is 
not possible to establish a plan for a small comer of the economy 
and permit all the rest of the economy to remain free. Gaston 
Bardet has shown that good city planning requires the mobiliza­
tion of the entire economy. Then, it will be said, the best thing is 
not to do any city planning at all. But planning cannot possibly 
be avoided; the explosive increase in t^e population means that 
no one will have any living space unless the area at our disposal 
is organized rationally. Moreover, certain inconveniences of urban 
life are daily becoming more serious; for example, traffic density, 
air pollution, and excessive noise. None of these problems can be 
effectively resolved except by means of a truly regulative plan. 
In the last few years, numerous medical and administrative con­
gresses have of necessity been concerned with this cluster of prob­
lems.
Similar problems are raised by immigration. No country is today 
in a position to allow free movement in or out: free movement 
would result in excessive population displacement in the direction 
of countries with high wages or political stability. Conversely, 
countries with dictatorial regimes would see their populations 
dwindle, a state of affairs they would not welcome since it means 
diminution of power. Democratic countries would see an exag-
The T echnologicai Society (271
gerated rise in their populations, which they certainly do not de­
sire because of the danger to their economic equilibrium and the 
risk of a fifth column. What is to be done? Put a complete stop to 
population displacement? Such a solution is neither possible nor 
desirable for reasons of manpower and colonization. But this pre­
supposes a plan for immigration, subject moreover to international 
agreement. Immigration planning will be identical whether we 
have to do with a dictatorship or a democracy. It will require 
identical police, economic, and administrative mechanisms. Present- 
day democracies cannot escape these technical necessities.
These examples help us grasp the fact that the structures of the 
modem state and its organs of government are subordinate to the 
techniques dependent on the state. If u>e were to consider in turn 
each of die indispensable services of the modem state, we would 
find that they are becoming more and more alike, regardless of the 
theories of government under which they operate. We must insist 
on the more and more; the final identity has not yet been achieved. 
There is no greater similarity among the techniques of the state 
than among mechanical techniques. There are backward countries 
with respect to both. But the direction of the evolution is plain, 
and there is, practically speaking, no way of arresting it. We shall 
see why.
The supremacy of technical instruments is a result of their exact 
correspondence to social necessities. When society did not have 
constantly to appeal to the state, when problems of all kinds were 
not as numerous or acute as they are today, the state was relatively 
free with respect to its instruments. In spite of all the worthy per­
sons who reassure themselves by saying that all historical epochs 
are alike, that the crises of the fourth century resembled those of 
the ninth, and so on, the fact is that no one ever before saw world 
economies, world wars, or world and national populations which, 
on the average, double every forty-five years. The state is no longer 
in a position to reject the most efficient means possible. Its prob­
lems are more difficult and complicated than any ever encountered 
before. If the state desires to have an effect on society ( and it has 
no alternative), there is only one way to have this effect. Parlia­
mentary discussions, the hesitance of theoreticians, the protesta­
tions of humanists, democratic elections— all of these signify very 
little. The state has no more real choice than the worker on the
tJ2 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
assembly line; it is led to the technical society by the very terms 
of the problem.
Let us consider two examples. The concentration camp is gen­
erally taken as characteristic of dictatorial and Fascistic regimes. 
Such institutions undeniably exist in the Soviet Union, Poland, and 
Bulgaria. But they existed in France under the Third Republic and 
in England during the Boer War. We must not be misled by dif­
ferences in name. Work camps, re-education camps, refugee camps 
— all represent the same fact. And we are only too aware of how 
important the use of concentration camps was in Algeria. We are 
speaking here of the concentration camp in its pure form, which 
has nothing to do with crematoria or hanging up the inmates by 
the thumbs. Such tortures are imputable to men, not to technique. 
The camp as an institution is making its appearance everywhere, 
under the most varied political regimes, as a result of the conjunc­
tion of social problems and police technique. The terms of the 
problem can be enumerated in this way; given the nationalistic 
organization and conversely the existence of fifth columns, given 
the administrative character of the supervision of territory and the 
population expansion, it is absolutely necessary to establish a police 
power based not on individuals but on categories of individuals. 
There is no way of escaping the establishment of police power by 
categories— which implies, for example, preventive arrest, con­
centration of masses of innocent persons not for judging but for 
sorting, and so forth. To effect sorting and checking operations, 
highly perfected systems have been developed, as, for example, 
the MVD in the Soviet Union, the FBI in the United States, and 
the CIC in occupied Germany. Such systems, obviously, often re­
quire a considerable length of time for their operations. Suspects 
may be detained for years before the system finishes its investiga­
tions. Its precision and rigor cause it to move slowly. The technical 
system of concentration camps has proved so efficient and satis­
factory to the state that it is increasingly being incorporated into 
our society. It no longer represents the activity of aberrant dicta­
tors, but rather the activity of every good administrator.
The concentration-camp system of today is closely linked to the 
nationalistic state. But it fits so well into administrative systems in 
general that there is no chance of its disappearing, even if the 
nationalistic structure of the modern world were to change. Certain
The Technological Society (273
categories of undesirables would remain, social misfits for whom 
the camp is the ideal solution, at least until a more efficient tech­
nique allows the resolution of the problem at even less expense. 
But it is highly improbable that this will happen in the near future.
The second example is the system of sales engineering, originally 
conceived in the United States to facilitate private commerce 
within the country. Now the system exists on the level of inter­
national commerce under state direction. There are firms which 
specialize in psychological and sociological prospecting of markets. 
The products of one nation cannot be sold on the markets of 
others unless they meet certain conditions, not only of manufacture 
but of design and usefulness. It would be clearly inefficient to ship 
products abroad which one knew in advance would not sell. It is 
said that there is not a single American firm which would dare 
launch a new product, even a hairpin, and itself assume responsi­
bility for design, color, etc. The firm takes its problem to one of the 
three or four large industrial-design consultants whose job it is to 
give to the object in question its optimum external appearance, 
that is, the appearance which best suits the public taste.
This approach to consumer research is recognized by American 
producers as the only correct one. It is nevertheless freely chosen. 
As soon as commerce becomes international, however, it enters 
more or less into the province of the state. The problem might 
then be how a nation with a foreign trade deficit could wipe it out. 
To accomplish this, it must comply with the law of the creditor’s 
market. One of the organizations described would have to be con­
sulted, and what was hitherto choice based on interest then be­
comes obligatory. Once more we see that a  technically backward 
nation is forced to model itself after the most advanced nation as 
soon as organic relations are established between the two. The 
situation is not due to American desire to dominate or to American 
pride. It is a technical situation. There is one and only one efficient 
method for establishing a system of international commerce, and 
it is necessary to comply with this method, no matter what the 
view of the state. Of course, the state could conceivably choose 
to go bankrupt. . . .
I have taken two examples as different as possible in order to 
emphasize the degree to which technical facts act upon the state 
in all areas.
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 7 4 )
But the facts lead us further. State constitutions do not alter the 
use of techniques, but techniques do act rather rapidly on state 
structures. They subvert democracy and tend to create a new 
aristocracy. Almost all sociologists are in agreement here; it is suffi­
cient to refer to the writings of Georges Friedmann to be con­
vinced of the unanimity which exists on this point even among 
sociologists with the most pronouncedly democratic and socialist 
leanings. Political equality becomes a myth— unattainable through 
the agency of technique. On the contrary, technique, to an ever 
greater degree, produces on the technical level a majority of serv­
ants and a minority of governors. Friedmann has studied the matter 
scientifically and has shown in a completely nonpartisan way that 
the worker-slaves are reduced to the lowest possible human 
value when their functions are specialized to completely particular 
tasks. We see in this phenomenon of specialization what technique 
makes of man in the aggregate. For example, the precision of police 
mechanisms makes it possible to train a good policeman in a few 
weeks. But the man so trained has no knowledge at all of the 
techniques within which he works. Men are shifted unceasingly 
from job to job, never attaining a true calling; they are vocationally 
downgraded by technique. But a vocation is a major part of life 
and culture. Under these circumstances, even a pervasive culture 
rapidly disappears.
We must also consider the influence of agricultural techniques 
which result in the exhaustion of certain types of soils while medi­
cal techniques lead to overpopulation. The interaction of these two 
factors brings about the creation of masses of underdeveloped hu­
man beings who are considered by some as unfit for democracy 
because they are ineanahle of reacting with the necessary speed 
to the problems of life.
In contrast to this mob there is a limited elite that understands 
the secrets of their own techniques, but not necessarily of all tech­
niques. These men are close to the seat of modem governmental 
power. The state is no longer founded on the “average citizen” but 
on the ability and knowledge of this elite The average man is al­
together unable to penetrate technical secrets or governmental or­
ganization and consequently can exert no influence at all on the 
state.
The Technological Society (275
Friedmann, in order to do something constructive about this 
downgraded and overspecialized manpower, has put his hopes in 
the evolution of socialism, which, by giving man the feeling of 
socialist brotherhood and the consciousness of working for the 
common good, would give him pleasure in his work. But this psy­
chological remedy (whose value I am not trying to deny) could 
do nothing at all to bridge the gap between the intellectual in­
capacity of the mob of specialized workers on the one hand and 
the monopoly of technical means by a technical elite on the other. 
The new elite is an elite even when it is popular with the people. 
This split is obvious in all domains. For example, in the administra­
tive domain, the intervention of a technique of organization and 
mechanization results in the creation, as Mas puts it, “of two classes 
very far removed from one another. The first, numerically small, 
understands the means to conceive, organize, direct and control; 
the second, infinitely more numerous, is composed of mere execu­
tants . . .” The latter are hacks who understand nothing of the 
complicated techniques they are carrying out It is not conceivable 
that the normal operation of democracy would be acceptable to 
those who exercise this technical monopoly— which, moreover, is 
a hidden monopoly in the sense that its practitioners are unknown 
to the masses.
Technique shapes an aristocratic society, which in turn implies 
aristocratic government. Democracy in such a society can only be 
a mere appearance. Even now, we see ki propaganda the premises 
of such a state of affairs. When it comes to state propaganda, there 
is no longer any question of democracy.
Let us consider ordinary propaganda as it occurs in republican 
countries. It is innocently said that since there is a plurality of 
parties and propaganda machines they counterbalance one an­
other. The elector is therefore free to make a real choice between 
rival candidates. However, certain persons, perhaps no less in­
nocently, claim to be able to mathematicize everything. Specifi­
cally, the propaganda which is most technical, the most skillful 
and urgent, gets the greatest number of votes. As far as I am con­
cerned, neither of these positions in itself perverts democracy. 
What does is the very accumulation of propaganda techniques, the 
very deployment of technical means for exerting pressure. It is not
TECHNIQUE AMD TH E STATE* 76 )
true that two opposed propaganda apparatuses cancel each other 
out Or rather, it may be true politically, but it is false psycho­
logically.
The real problem lies in the psychological situation of the in­
dividual assailed by a number of equally skillful propagandas act­
ing upon his nervous system, and now, with the discovery of new 
methods, probing and disturbing his unconscious, working over 
his intelligence, and exacerbating his reactions. The individual can 
no longer live except in a climate of tension and overexcitement. 
He can no longer be a smiling and skeptical spectator. He is indeed 
"engaged,” but involuntarily so, since he has ceased to dominate his 
own thoughts and actions. Techniques have taught the organizers 
how to force him into the game. He has been stripped of his power 
of judgment. If he has not been “fixed” in advance, he oscillates 
at random, in obedience not to his own power of judgment but to 
the law of large numbers. The intensive use of propaganda de­
stroys the citizen’s faculty of discernment In a truly democratic 
regime, everything rests on judicious choice and free w ill But it 
is precisely in democracies that propaganda machines proliferate. 
Where only a single propaganda machine exists, that of the state, 
it conditions individuals directly and could not be really intensive 
since there is no competition. In the so-called democracies, propa­
ganda must become more and more intense in order to. dominate 
its rivals. It becomes thereby more and more insidious.
Thus, technique disturbs immediately the operation of a democ­
racy. It leads public opinion in one direction only, because the 
means at the disposal of a state directed by a technical aristocracy 
are generally more powerful than those at the disposal of parties. 
The very presence of technique, therefore, poses a grave prohlero-
But for every political system a further problem arises: the 
changing variety of available machines, which entails the disor­
dering of traditional strategic and tactical military conceptions. It 
is of course possible to concoct grand theories on the art o f war 
and strategic doctrines, to organize armies in accordance with 
philosophic principles, and so on. But one factor always upsets 
everything: the machine. The machine has in fact conditioned 
modern strategy. Hitler, because he understood this, achieved cer­
tain successes. The technical problem can be simply stated: given 
a certain machine, how can it be used most efficiently? What ac-
The Technological Society i * 7 7
tions concerning logistics, liaison, and co-ordination of weapons 
must be taken? What plan must be created to make optimal use of 
the machine? And so on. For example, the tank conditioned com­
bat between 1939 and 1943. Today aircraft, guided missiles, and 
intercontinental rockets are of major inportance. But beyond the 
effect of technique on strategy, the changing machinery of war 
forces political choice. The United States, in a Congressional re­
port (1949), recognized that because of the rapid advance of 
technique it was no longer in a position to pay for complete arma­
ment— for a land army with an unlimited number of vehicles of 
every type, plus a navy and an air force. The military aircraft of 
1946 were already out of date by 1949. It seemed impossible to 
continue the construction of machines by the thousands which 
would never see service and would so soon be outmoded. A politi­
cal choice had to be made.
Similarly, Britain abandoned most of its prototypes in order to 
devote itself to constructing a unique kind of army judged to be 
decisive. The fact of forced political choice was confirmed by the 
distribution of military tasks among continental Europe, the United 
States, and Great Britain as a consequence of the Atlantic Pact 
With further developments, it became necessary to seek new 
modes of financing to support the burden of a military technique 
distributed as described. This reminds us of the interdependence 
of techniques in general and in particular of the influence of tech­
nique on military concepts and through this on political choice. In 
this connection, recall Bevan’s biting remark in one of his last lec­
tures: "The techniques of modem war have destroyed democ­
racy.” This is precisely our point.
Let us reason by analogy. In the same way that military machines 
condition strategy, organizational and other techniques condition 
the structure of the modem state. Wiener was not speaking idly 
when he said that the different systems of broadcasting and air­
transport networks make a world state inevitable. Technique puts 
the question, not whether a given state form is more just, but 
whether it permits more efficient utilization of techniques. The 
state is no longer caught between political reality and moral theo­
ries and imperatives. It is caught between political reality and 
technical means. The problem is to find the state form most ade­
quate to the application of the techniques the state has at its dis-
378  )  TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
posal. Doubtless, it is free to prefer a certain doctrine and to look 
with disfavor on a given technique. It is free to dream of the reali­
zation of a certain kind of justice rather than to make use of tech­
nical means. But then it must expect almost inevitable retribution 
such as the French Army suffered in 1940. Our generals had their 
doctrine and their military conceptions, but they neglected the in­
fluence of the machine— a heroic example, it was said, of getting 
yourself killed at the outposts of progress. Face to face with techni­
cal efficiency, the state owes it to itself to give this efficiency free 
rein. Ardant has written: “Good methods bring about good struc­
tures.”
These factors doom parliamentary government, which is bur­
dened with considerable excess baggage which hinders technical 
progress: the numerous persons involved in decision making, the 
ponderousness and slowness of democratic mechanisms, the com­
plete inability of a representative assembly to apply political tech­
nique, the frequent turnover in parliamentary personnel in contrast 
to the stability of the technicians in the service of the administra­
tion, etc. As a result of these factors, technical advance gradually 
invades the state, which in turn is compelled to assume forms and 
adopt institutions favorable to this advance. The importance of 
“commissions” in French parliamentary life is already recognized, 
and, it might be added, these commissions have clearly got out of 
hand. In the United States the system of lobbyists (a group of in­
dividuals who hang about the corridors of Congress) assures liai­
son between the legislative organ and the technical organ. All the 
great American corporations and technical groups have representa­
tives accredited to Washington who are charged with looking after 
the interests (not necessarily in the capitalist sensed of the groups 
they represent in the legislative branch. The system is perfectly 
legal in the United States and allows the retention of some connec­
tion between politicians (who are more and more detached from 
reality) and the technical conditions of life. Such institutions rep­
resent very weak modes of adaptation. It is certain that the mod­
ern state will eventually be compelled to total adaptation. Total 
adaptation may come about through a revolution, such as the one 
which created the Hitler state. It may be, however, that the con­
stitution will not undergo even the slightest of alterations and that 
the whole problem will be reduced to the elimination of political
The Technological Society (279
powers, which will have become purely formal, a mere matter of 
show. The conclusion seems unavoidable that this is the road upon 
which our democracies have already entered.
But if the state adapts itself completely to technical necessities 
and becomes nothing but a huge machine, will it still be recogniz­
ably a state? Let us first of all remark that the question in no sense 
presupposes a theory of a technological state. Things happen today 
in the political sphere without the benefit of the minutest theory. 
There is no longer any question of a state in the classic sense. To 
think otherwise is a laughable error on the part of the majority of 
those who talk about the state, b^ they philosophers, theologians, 
publicists, politicians, or professors of constitutional law. They are 
speaking of the state in terms and forms appropriate to the state of 
the nineteenth century, or to that of Napoleon. The situation today 
is radically different.
The political power is no longer precisely a classical state, and it 
will be less and less so. It is an amalgam of organizations with a 
greatly reduced organism for making decisions, reduced because, 
in the interplay of techniques, decision making has less and less 
place. The situation is comparable to the elimination by an auto­
matic machine of the individual, who retains no function except 
that of inspecting the machine and seeing that it remains in work­
ing order; the political power is like any well-adjusted organization 
which functions with a minimum of decision making. Such an or­
ganization is not too rigid and knows of itself how to adapt to cur­
rent problems. We are admittedly not yet in this situation, but we 
are rapidly approaching it/ This is the state form which Lenin 
forecast for the socialist world. "The state,” he said, “will be re­
duced to census taking and statistics.” Lenin of necessity described 
the future role of the state in a very summary fashion; the tech­
niques of organization were not yet developed in 1920. But what 
he discerned is exactly what we observe in outline today behind
* We shall sot consider here "machines for evaluating m ilitary situations and de­
termining the best action." These m achines are no m ere fantasy. W iener, Shannon, 
and M orgenstern—among the elite of American m athem aticians—are working o n  
such a machine and speak of it as "imminent." W iener even thinks that this will 
lead to a m achine to evaluate political situations. Cybernetic devices will m ake 
die state conduct politics as one plays a game of chess. If this apocalyptic possibility 
is realized, we clearly cannot foresee the consequences for the state. We therefore 
shall not consider the hypothesis.
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATEl80 )
the old-fashioned republican mask. It is not necessary that such a 
society be socialist. What seems to be important is that the state 
Lenin foresaw and the purely technological state which modern 
organizations imply are in fact identical.
That such a state is socialist is debatable. That it is technical (a 
statement not intended as a theory) is not debatable. At this very 
moment, technical synthesis could bring about the total elimination 
of the state in the traditional sense. The framework in which society 
exists could get along well enough without the traditional state, and 
perhaps even do better without it. The technological state corre­
sponds directly to modem society itself since it is technically con­
structed and exists in the very soul of men who worship efficiency, 
order, and speed. The classical state corresponds to vanished forces 
of an entirely different nature.
Technique and Political Doctrine*. The structure of the state is 
not the only thing modified by technique; political doctrines are 
modified too.
We note, first of all, that the same thing holds for political doc­
trines as for political structures, that some are adapted to technical 
usage and some are not. In general, the new doctrines (those, for 
example, of the people’s democracies, which it would be stupid to 
lump together naively as “Stalinist” ) are so adapted. “No freedom 
for the enemies of freedom”; “Only the worker is a citizen”; “the 
state guarantees freedom; the stronger the state, the more freedom 
is guaranteed." These slogans are representative of an idea which is 
becoming prevalent. Doctrinal elements coincide exactly with the 
development of state techniques; doctrine expresses the social 
situation exactly and is therefore vital. It is believed in by a large 
number of citizens; it tends toward effective application and pos­
sesses a contagious force. On the other hand, the doctrines of tra­
ditional democracy— the rights of man, the abstract conception of 
the citizen, equality in voting, the clash between power and liberty 
— are not adapted to modern social reality. For this reason, we are 
witnessing the rapid sclerosis and obsolescence of these doctrines; 
and it is becoming harder and harder to defend them. Public opin­
ion no longer holds with them, except possibly among the Ameri­
cans, who seem still to believe in individual freedom, a somewhat 
theoretic concept. But democratic peoples as a whole are more at­
tached to traditions than to precise doctrines. Democratic doctrine
The Technological Society (281
is, in any case, unadapted to technical progress, a fact which robs 
it of any compelling force or power to make new conquests.
Documents such as the United Nations Declaration of Human 
Rights mean nothing to a mankind surrounded by techniques. It is 
our responsibility to study man’s situation vis-i-vis techniques and 
not vis-a-vis some no longer existent force. No one gets worked up 
about declarations which may be violated with impunity, whether 
by private enterprise (as exemplified by the attitude of employers 
on the subject of strikes in 1948) or by the state itself (as in the 
case of the law of September 15,1948, concerning war crimes, a di­
rect violation of the declaration of rights).
Technique has rendered traditional democratic doctrines obso­
lete. This should be regarded as a normal situation, for no political 
doctrine is eternal. When situations change, doctrines must change 
too. Evolution is necessary, whether it takes place under the in­
fluence of technique or in some other way. But one fact does seem 
new: what is in question is not merely a change of doctrine; politi­
cal doctrine is being called upon to play a fundamentally different 
role. In the nineteenth century, political doctrine was strongly pre­
scriptive and constitutive; this was consonant both with the whole 
idealist and romantic movement and with the belief in progress. 
Men were convinced of the omnipotence of ideas and were pre­
pared to put into action doctrines which appeared to them to be 
just. Doctrinal motives played a role of prime importance in the 
Revolution of 1789. Napoleon I was disgraced because of his lack 
of doctrine, a deficiency which Napoleon III sought to overcome. 
Republics and even monarchies were anxious to apply that doc­
trine which was most just. Political doctrine, whatever its content, 
established an end to be attained. It represented the best form of 
government, founded in reason (rather than in history) and in phi­
losophy. The problem was to realize the ideal. Doctrine was the 
criterion of action; it was the judge not so much of whether the ac­
tion was well or ill done as of whether the action was valid with re­
spect to the doctrine itself. Even Marx was of this mind; for him 
also, doctrine represented the end and criterion of action. Mani­
festly, doctrine dominated political life; it was no mere conceit but 
a reality.
With the introduction of technical development into the life of 
the state, the situation becomes completely different; doctrine is
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE282  )
merely explicative and justifying. It no longer represents the end; 
the end is defined by the autonomous operation of techniques. It is 
no longer the criterion of action; the sole criterion of action consists 
in knowing whether or not technique has been correctly used, and 
no political theory can tell us that.
Political doctrine, since about 1914, works in this way: the state 
is forced by the operation of its own proper techniques to form its 
doctrine of government on the basis of technical necessities. These 
necessities compel action in the same way that techniques permit 
it. Political theory comes along to explain action in its ideological 
aspect and in its practical aspect (frequently without indicating its 
purely technical motives). Finally, political doctrine intervenes to 
justify action and to show that it corresponds to ideals and to moral 
principles. The man of the present feels a great need for justifica­
tion. He needs the conviction that his government is not only effi­
cient but just Unfortunately, efficiency is a fact and justice a 
slogan.
We conclude that the political doctrine of today is a rationalizing 
mechanism for justifying the state and its actions and is the source 
of the dangerous intellectual acrobatics indulged in by official jour­
nalists and statesmen. Sometimes the preoccupation of these gen­
tlemen is to square some totally unjust action with democratic 
principles. A good example of this was the British intervention of 
1944 in Greece as a function of the Yalta agreements. This interven­
tion resulted in the crushing of a popular movement (represented 
by ELAS and EAM)  under the pretext of organizing a Western- 
style democracy. Sometimes the aim of these men is to create a 
judicial doctrine in order to justify purely pragmatic action. The 
masterpiece of this species of rationalization was the theory of 
"trusteeship.” Judicially, the theory was extremely well constructed, 
but its application led the United States inevitably to occupy the 
Japanese islands while forbidding the Soviet Union to occupy any 
enemy colony whatever. The direction of this "theory” is clearly 
visible. All the theories concerning “crimes against humanity” are 
of this order; the charge of genocide is in fact the judicial justifica­
tion of the need to condemn the vanquished as war criminals.
The French Constitution of 1958 is another example of this tend­
ency; it was devised to justify a de facto situation. The Commu­
nists, however, are the real virtuosi of this genre. They have re-
The Technological Society (383
moved all the bones from Marxist doctrine and reduced it to a 
method. Once this is achieved, no contradiction between doctrine 
and action is possible. Take, for instance, the Soviet doctrine of 
the necessity of the “national stage” in the development of all 
peoples, a doctrine intended to justify Soviet intervention in Africa. 
All Soviet actions are a consequence of their method, which, being 
at the same time a doctrine, serves to justify action.
The only real problem, then, is to know whether action has been 
effective by virtue of the correct application of method. The prob­
lem thus becomes purely technical. In ordinary democratic govern­
ments, the unity of doctrine and method resolves all contradictions 
that show themselves as bad conscience. Nowadays, it is enough if 
fidelity to method is assured— this fidelity, as all techniques, is 
tested by results— for justification to be assured also. Justification, 
no doubt, only in the eyes of those who already believe in the doc­
trine. It is illusory to think that political doctrine can justify action 
in an objective way, erga omnes. The adversary is never really 
taken in by this “justification,” although he may well accept it, since 
he uses it himself.
This transformation of the role of political doctrine demonstrates 
the complete vanity of pfesent-day political theories. When we see 
such theoreticians as Max Glass or Ropke proposing a new world 
structure to resolve all problems, or a new political regime to satisfy 
all exigencies, we stand confounded before such innocence (in the 
etymological sense of the word). These political innocents always 
suppose that theories have educational force, that mobs can bestir 
themselves to apply principles, and that ideal doctrines will be­
come ends. The plain truth is that such opinions have been over­
taken and left behind.
The role of doctrines is fixed with precision by political technique, 
and since nothing else can stem the tide of history or of techniques, 
there is no room for the supposition that political doctrines will 
change roles in the near future. Because of the vanity of their pre­
tentions, our political theoreticians cannot be taken seriously. How 
could we possibly take seriously, on the political level, anyone who 
does not even know how to view fundamental events? Or who takes 
as fundamental what he reads in the newspaper?
In many ways this profound transformation of political doctrines 
is perhaps not very new. What was new was the attention paid to
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE284)
doctrine in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Before that 
time, political theories incontestably played the role of justifiers, 
as they do today. Thus, the counselors of Philip IV, armed with the 
whole apparatus of Roman law, used it for the sole purpose of lend­
ing an appearance of legitimacy to the acts of their king. The same 
applies to Richelieu and to the theory of the divine right of kings. 
(I purposely do not cite Machiavelli because his theories were 
never applied.) In reality the brutal reversal we are witnessing at 
present is essentially a return to a long tradition. Power is power; 
but it cannot be exercised without at least the appearance of justice. 
Doctrine is charged, therefore, with the task of furnishing power 
with this semblance of justice. We repeat, it has not always been so. 
But since, at present, power is technique, these intellectual con­
structs no longer have any usefulness beyond supplying justifica­
tion.
The Totalitarian State. Finally, technique causes the state to be­
come totalitarian, to absorb the citizens’ life completely. We have 
noted that this occurs as a result of the accumulation of techniques 
in the hands of the state. Techniques are mutually engendered and 
hence interconnected, forming a system that tightly encloses all our 
activities. When the state takes hold of a single thread of this net­
work of techniques, little by little it draws to itself all the matter 
and the method, whether or not it consciously wills to do so.
Even when the state is resolutely liberal and democratic, it can­
not do otherwise than become totalitarian. It becomes so either 
directly or, as in the United States, through intermediate persons. 
But, despite differences, all such systems come ultimately to the 
same result. I shall not repeat these facts since I believe that I have 
sufficiently emphasized them.
Technique engenders totalitarianism by another expedient: its 
mode of action. Let us take a simple example, that of total war. 
There has been a theory of total war, and consequently, it would 
seem, some will and choice in the matter. But the action of tech­
niques nowadays makes war of necessity total. The use of guided 
missiles such as the Va weapons and rockets which had an error of 
about nine miles in three hundred, presupposed that the great 
majority of them would fall among the civilian population. The 
same holds for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile: one ICBM is 
capable of destroying all life over very considerable areas. Auto-
The Technological Society ( » 8 g
matic steering mechanisms can give great precision to the flight of 
antiaircraft missiles. But precision of aim has no meaning when 
targets are terrestrial objects closely grouped together. A  formation 
of bombers is isolated in the sky, and a missle fired at them neces­
sarily hits a military target. But this is not so on the ground.
The situation is even more acute with an H-bomb which can de­
stroy everything within a radius of thirty miles. Despite any and 
all possible precautions, the H bomb would destroy civilians and 
nonmilitary structures. There is no need here to decide whether or 
not to make total war. Even if one wished to limit it, war is total be­
cause the means are totalitarian.
The same applies to civilian techniques. It is no longer possible 
to limit their effects even if there is a desire to do so. Censoring 
films may sometimes limit their subject matter, give them a con­
formist tone or a moral content; but it does not touch the essential, 
that is, the psychic modification of the individual by means of the 
violent impression films make upon him. The emotion he inevitably 
feels modifies the psychological tonus of the individual and tends 
to make him a component of a mob. Such effects lie outside the 
range of possible means of rectification. Or, put more precisely, 
new means of rectification will be invented. One might, for ex­
ample, try psychoanalysis or one might limit the number of per­
formances each week. But such measures only represent a new at­
tack on the human soul or a new limitation of freedom.
It would be possible to consider in turn every element of state 
technique and to show that each one, pushed to the limit, leads to 
totalitarianism. Jacques Driencourt has unwittingly done this for 
propaganda and Ernst Kohn-Bramstedt for police techniques.
Driencourt attempts to show that propaganda is consistent with 
democracy, but he recognizes parenthetically that democratic gov­
ernment is obliged to integrate propaganda into its institutions for 
reasons outside its own principles. He recognizes that democracy 
is obliged to exploit the same practices, the same violation of hu­
man conscience, and the same encouragement of conformism as 
does totalitarianism. He has, in fact, shown that propaganda is in 
itself totalitarian. And when he asserts that propaganda is demo­
cratic if it is not a monopoly, he forgets what he proved at the be­
ginning of his book, that propaganda always tends to monopoly. 
The fact is that when the state employs a complete and technical
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE286)
propaganda system, it inevitably becomes totalitarian. Driencourt 
notes with surprise that “the country which boasts of being most 
liberal [that is, the United States] is the country in which the tech­
nique of thought direction is, by its perfection, the closest to totali­
tarian practices; and is the country in which people, accustomed 
to living in groups, are most inclined to leave it to the experts to 
&  lines of spiritual conduct.”
As for the police power, it is to be noted that when it becomes 
technical, it assumes the leading position in the state and becomes 
a fundamental institution, not merely a supplementary one. It af­
firms itself as the “essence of the state.” It appears as a mysterious 
entity which evades all laws and assumes complete autonomy. As 
Hamel says: “It is the irrational nucleus which escapes all defini­
tion and limitation by the sovereignity of the state.” In fact, we 
might as well have an undisguised totalitarianism which controls 
everything, since the simple use of techniques produces a totalitar­
ian structure of the state, as it does in the economy.
Why is this so? The answer is that technique is a mass instru­
ment. One can think of technique only in terms of categories. 
Technique has no place for the individual; the personal means 
nothing to it  We certainly cannot deny in theory that every individ­
ual is particular; we even concede him his particularity willingly. 
But in the case of rules of organization and action we are unable to 
take this particularity into account. It must remain carefully con­
cealed; the particular is identical with the subjective and is not 
allowed to show. If it could appear it would have to do so by way 
of technique, and in technique there is no particular. Technical 
procedures, therefore, abstract from the individual and seek traits 
common to masses of men and mass phenomena. Without these com­
mon traits, neither statistics nor the use of the law of great numbers 
nor the Gaussian curve— indeed, no organization— would be pos­
sible. Abstraction from the individual is doubtless intended only 
as a formal procedure for the convenience of reasoning. But the 
formal has become terribly real. It has produced the world which 
constrains man on every side, which leaves him no outlet to that 
realm which was ostensibly excluded merely for the convenience 
of reasoning. There no longer exists any form in which the particu­
lar can be concretely incarnated because form has become the 
domain of technique. Technique, in the form of psychotechnique,
TheTechnological Society (287
aspires to take over the individual, that is, to transform the qual­
itative into the quantitative. It knows only two possible solutions: 
the transformation or the annihilation of the qualitative. It is pre­
cisely by way of the former that technique is totalitarian; and 
when the state becomes technical, it too becomes totalitarian; it has 
no alternative.
The words the totalitarian state inevitably evoke cliches and 
passionate opinions. But these no longer represent anything but 
historical reminiscences. The totalitarian state we are discussing 
here is not the brutal, immoderate thing which tortured, deformed, 
and broke everything in its path, the battleground of armed bullies 
and factions, a place of dungeons and the reign of the arbitrary. 
These things did certainly exist; but they represented transient 
traits, not real characteristics of the totalitarian state. It might even 
be said that they were the human aspects of the state in its inhu­
manity. Torture and excess are the acts of persons who use them as 
a means of releasing a suppressed need for power. This does not in­
terest us here. It does not represent the true face of the completely 
technical, totalitarian state. In such a state nothing useless exists; 
there is no torture; torture is a wasteful expenditure of psychic 
energy which destroys salvageable resources without producing 
useful results. There is no systematically organized famine, but 
rather a recognition of the pressing necessity of maintaining the 
labor force in good condition. There is nothing arbitrary, for the 
arbitrary represents the very opposite of technique, in which every­
thing “has a reason” ( not a final but a mechanical reason). Irra­
tionality might appear to exist— but only for the person who 
knows nothing of technique; it is like trying to tell a man who does 
not know the radio that there is music all around him although he 
cannot hear it.
The totalitarian state does not necessarily have totalitarian theo­
ries, nor does it necessarily even desire them. On the contrary, what 
we call totalitarian doctrines litter up the clear line of the technical 
state with aberrant elements such as “race,” “blood,” “proletariat” 
The technical state is the technical state only because it exploits 
certain technical means.
There is, however, a great difference between the democracies 
and the so-called totalitarian states. All are followingthe same road, 
but dictatorial states have become conscious of the possibilities of
*88  ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
exploiting technique. They know and consciously desire whatever 
advantage can be drawn from it. The rule, for them, is to use means 
Without limitation of any sort. The democratic states, on the other 
hand, have not attained to this consciousness and are consequently 
inhibited in their development Scruples concerning tradition, 
principles, judicial affirmations, the maintenance of a fagade of 
public and private morality— all these still exist in the democratic 
state. It may be going too far to say that scruples concerning hu­
man beings also exist in democratic states; the democratic state is 
preoccupied most of all with a very special type of man: the voter.
All these scruples, in any case, are without force or reality. They 
are merely verbal smokescreens, and the democracies disregard 
them every time it is necessary to do so. This fagade no longer 
corresponds in any way to a real community; it represents only 
vestiges of a community. Nevertheless, however without substance 
such talk may be, it still has great importance in democratic life, 
especially as it acts to prevent democratic governments from 
launching themselves along the road of technique without some 
other justification. Here, more than anywhere else, justification is 
necessary. Even so, democracies have a bad governmental con­
science which no one has succeeded in dispelling. The state has 
not taken the decisive step of affirming that only technical neces­
sity counts; it has therefore failed to do two things: to become con­
scious (of what the state can accomplish by exploiting tech­
niques) and to sow its wild oats (by deciding that there are no 
compelling moral reasons to get in its way). Thus, at present every 
time the democratic state exploits a given technique, it must begin 
all over again to justify itself, to debate the necessity of the pro­
posed measure, and to question everything. In the long run it will 
have to capitulate, but in the meantime its scruples act as a drag on 
it, if not in the actual application of techniques (which would, in 
any case, be impossible), at least in its enterprise. In order to force 
the democratic state to come to any decision there must always be 
a “present danger,” some direct competition with the dictatorial 
state, in which action becomes a matter of life or death.
The superiority of dictatorship stems wholly from its massive ex­
ploitation of techniques. Democracy has no choice in the matter: 
either it utilizes techniques in the same way as the enemy, or it will
The Technological Society (289
perish. It is clear enough that the first term of this proposition will 
prevail For this reason, wars always bring about a prodigious 
advance in the use of certain techniques in democratic societies. 
The democracies are, of course, careful to assert that they are using 
these techniques only because of the state of war. But there are al­
ways wars of one kind or another: war preparations, cold war, hot 
war, new cold war, and so on, ad infinitum.
Indeed, cold war is as productive as hot war in forcing the 
democracies to imitate the dictatorships in the use of technique. 
The officers of the French Army, for example, have been obliged to 
engage in psychological activity and subversive war to counter the 
enemy’s use of these. Here is a good example of technical imitation 
of a dictatorship by a democracy.
Up to this point we have contrasted the democratic state with the 
dictatorial state. But we have not distinguished among the different 
forms assumed by the dictatorships. There are two major lines 
followed by these states, represented, respectively, by Commu­
nism and Fascism. The question might be put whether or not these 
two are identical. A superficial, bourgeois survey will immediately 
come up with an affirmative answer, on the basis of certain massive 
facts of the present day. It might be noted, for example, that both 
sides have concentration camps, enormous police apparatuses, 
torture, ration cards, economic and other kinds of planning, plebi­
scites in place of elections, a single party (Nazi or Communist) 
dominating the state, a single individual exercising plenary pow­
ers, and so on. This adds up to a complex of identical forms; as a 
consequence, the regimes are alike. The intellectuals, however, 
will protest against such a hasty assimilation of the two; and in a 
deeper sense, the differences are real.
In Communism, despite its methods, there is an indubitable will 
to human liberation. It has the genuine support of millions of 
poverty-striken persons and, consequently, a humane aspect which 
Fascism never possessed. It recruits its adherents from many dif­
ferent parties— on the one hand from the true proletariat and on the 
other from the “Lumpen-proletariat,” that is to say, a sub-proletar­
iat without positive value. Communism has the honesty not to 
affirm bogus spiritual values or make pacts with international cap­
italism. In addition, the fact that Nazism was anti-Semitic has a
2go) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
special significance for Christians— a point which Karl Barth has 
emphasized. Communism as such does not imply this, even though 
it may become anti-Semitic for short periods.
Upon closer analysis, however, we find a similarity between the 
two: a comparable attitude toward techniques. This relation may 
appear to some a bit thin, but it is the very essence of the twin 
movement represented by Communism and Fascism, both of 
which owe their origin to techniques, and uniquely so. Communism 
emerges when the development of certain techniques endangers 
the very society which has allowed them to flourish. Communist 
dialectic makes its appearance as an explanation of the way in 
which technical progress first produced a society, then transcended 
that society’s economic and political forms, finally provoking their 
inevitable decline. Marxism orders this succession of events into a 
precise doctrine. It furnishes the key to an understanding of the 
modern world and at the same time ties its own fate to that of tech­
nique. Recall in this connection the famous remark of Lenin con­
cerning socialism and electrification. Marxism is, in fact, nothing 
but an epiphenomenon of technical development, a phase of the 
painful marriage of man and technique. “Neither with thee, nor 
without thee.” It is an attempt at dialectic reconciliation, so to 
speak.
Fascism stands in exactly the same relation to technique. It can be 
stated without exaggeration (in spite of the scandalous character 
of such an affirmation) that both Fascism and Nazism are approxi­
mations derived from Marx for the adaptation of man to his tech­
niques. They represent that part of Marxism which is centered on 
the narrower problem of the state and technique, whereas Marx­
ism itself is a broader theory encompassing the totality of the prob­
lem of society and technique. Nazism, however, far from being 
opposed to Marxism, completes it and confirms it. It gives the solu­
tion to numerous problems of adaptation. Hitler's methods stem 
directly from Lenin’s precepts; and conversely, Stalinism learned 
certain lessons about technique from the Nazis.
If we suppress the episodic in order to get at the essential, we 
find in the two fraternal enemies the same phenomenon of awe at 
the power to be had from technique, and the same enthusiastic pur­
suit of the same objective. The Guelphs and the Ghibellines made 
merciless war on each other to decide which party was to exercise
The Technological Society (2  j) 1
world supremacy. But they had the same objective: the greatest 
possible power of the state whose sovereignty had no limits, the 
earthly hope of all whom feudal anarchy had exhausted.
The dictatorial state has efficiency as its goal. It submits to the 
law of techniques, for it understands that only by giving tech­
niques free rein can it hope to derive the maximum profit from 
them. Whatever techniques are involved— human or physical, eco­
nomic or educational— the state musters around it all available 
technical instruments. This occurs spontaneously, by chance; but 
in dictatorial states it is voluntary, calculated, studied (and there­
fore the process occurs more rapidly). It is the end sought by all 
forms of state. The Communist knows that technical progress 
means the progress of the proletariat. The Nazi knows that he is the 
instrument of state power; he cannot conceive that anyone would 
allow its limitation.
Nazism gave its goals an ideological veneer, but this veneer was 
futile insofar as it was not an instrument of propaganda and pro­
ceeded too rapidly. Communism, in its fusion of technique and 
state, proved much more prudent and in that sense more humanis­
tic. It was in this way closer to reality and less shocking to the con­
science of the average man. Hitlerism caused the essential barbar­
ism of the thing to explode in men’s faces. Behemoth showed his 
true face, and it proved to be too terrifying for the man of 1930, 
who still sought to hold on to some of his illusions and to preserve 
for himself at least the semblance of freedom. In this, Nazism com­
mitted a grave error which the Communists knew well enough how 
to exploit. However, both Nazism and Communism were working 
toward the total exploitation of the means which man had created 
to vanquish necessity.
Summum Jus: Summa Injuria
The function of justice provokes an unending major debate be­
tween the claims of justice and those of judicial technique.
Judicial technique is in every way much less self-confident than 
the other techniques, because it is impossible to transform the 
notion of justice into technical elements. Despite what philosophers 
may say, justice is not a thing which can be grasped or fixed. If one
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*9* )
pursues genuine justice (and not some automatism or egalitarian* 
ism), one never knows where one will end. A law created as a func­
tion of justice has something unpredictable in it which embar­
rasses the jurist. Moreover, justice is not in the service of the state; 
it even claims the right to judge the state. Law created as a function 
of justice eludes the state, which can neither create nor modify it. 
The state of course sanctions this situation only to the degree that it 
has little power or has not yet become fully self-conscious; or to the 
degree that its jurists are not exclusively technical rationalists and 
subordinated to efficient results. Under these conditions, technique 
assumes the role of a handmaiden modestly resigned to the fact that 
she does not automatically get what she desires.
A certain equilibrium is established between the pursuit of jus­
tice and the judicial technique which flourishes in a period of natu­
ral law.5  Judicial technique has a place, but in many respects it is 
not easily defined.
There are indeed very different definitions of the role of judicial 
technique. For Saleille, judicial technique constitutes the arrange­
ment of judicial concepts, the reduction of rules to a coherent sys­
tem. This limits it to a highly theoretical notion, essentially an in­
tellectual operation. The same holds for Savigny’s contention that 
judicial technique is concerned with the scientific elaboration of 
law by jurists, as opposed to the spontaneous creation of law by the 
people! This is doubtless not inexact, but Savigny is referring rather 
to the consequences of judicial technique. It is true that when 
judicial technique develops, the spontaneous creation of law de­
clines and dies; that the popular source of law is sterilized by 
learned law; and that this gives the jurists a free hand. But then, 
Savigny is describing an aspect of judicial technique, not the pur­
pose of judicial technique. We come much closer to actuality with 
Kohler, who assigns to judicial technique the role of adapting legal 
texts to practice. And it is Kohler’s concept which has guided the 
major authors who have studied the problem of judicial technique, 
albeit with individual differences (Geny, Dabin, Haesaert, Per- 
rot).
In this context, judicial technique consists in setting reality in a 
framework of means through legal decisions and in rendering these
9 O n these points, see m y Fondementthtologique du droit.
The Technological Society (a g 3
decisions effective. It can then be reasonably argued that political 
function and judicial technique are complementary. Political func­
tion consists in supplying the substance of the rules, that is, the 
goal to be attained, the political or social ideal which the law is to 
realize. By its laws the state will also indicate ways and means of 
reaching the political goal, and in so doing will approach reality 
to a sufficient degree, without, however, grappling with it directly. 
It is the task of the jurists to give form to the instructions and de­
cisions of the law, not only by rendering them systematic but by 
implementing them. Legal form is clearly not a mere verbal, ex­
ternal matter, but a means of effecting something. It has a broader 
scope than Perrot suggests when he defines legal technique as an 
“operational procedure meant to secure the goal sought by the 
will by causing the will to enter onto the legal plane.'
But this exclusive relation between technique and will, which 
leaves out the whole judicial expression of social and economic 
Teality, is far too restricted. Judicial technique is not merely a 
technique of adaptation but one of creation of law in its entirety.
The great task of judicial technique then is to arrange the ele­
ments furnished it by the political function in order that the law 
not be merely a verbalism, a dead letter. And this takes a whole 
arsenal of proofs, civil and penal sanctions, guarantees, in short, 
the whole detailed mechanism created to secure the realization of 
the ends of the law.
Haesaert seems to me to have defined this judicial technique ex­
cellently as “the ensemble of means by which the subjects of law 
are induced to take, in the social system in which they exist, the 
legal attitude," the active or passive behavior judged necessary. It 
is really, therefore, a question of obedience, and this is in fact the 
end toward which judicial technique aims.
For the technician of the law, all law depends on efficiency. 
There is no law but in its application. A law which is not applied 
is not a law. Obedience to rule is the fundamental condition of its 
being. Legal abstraction is unreal. The whole technical apparatus 
(expression of legal norms, publication of laws, applications in 
jurisprudence or doctrine, voluntary or forced realization) has but 
one end: the application of the law. And this complex corresponds 
exacdy to the notion of technique in general, that is, an artificial 
search for efficiency. In this definition, efficiency is taken in its
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE2 94 )
pure state; we are forced to admit that law does not exist without 
it. The term artificial is used in the same way; law is no longer 
obeyed spontaneously, and the popular consciousness which origi­
nally created law does not adhere spontaneously and naturally to 
this system. Application of law no longer arises from popular ad­
hesion to it but from the complex of mechanisms which, by means of 
artifice and reason, adjust behavior to rule.
This technical creation of law is, then, requisite and gains its 
scope through two operations:
1) By means of the first the judicial element is separated from 
the law as such. The judicial element (which becomes principally 
organization) is no longer charged with pursuing justice or creating 
law in any way whatsoever. It is charged with applying the laws. 
This role can be perfectly mechanical. It does not call for a phi­
losopher or a man with a sense of justice. What is needed is a good 
technician, who understands the principles of the technique, the 
rules of interpretation, the legal terminology, and the ways of de­
ducing consequences and finding solutions. The removal of law 
from the concrete is a great step forward in the process of tech- 
nicization. The judicial element is charged with certain practical 
questions but, as we have said, not with making law. It is in a 
position to become technical in detail because the problem of 
justice is no longer one of its concerns. It does not have to be judge 
of the rules which it is commissioned to apply.
2) The dissociated judicial element gains more efficiency to the 
degree that it is made completely technical. It becomes possible to 
divorce judicial reasoning from a “dangerous empiricism, by con­
fining the infinite diversity of judicial situations to a limited num­
ber of conceptual frameworks.” Fundamental legal institutions 
thereby derive simplicity and vigor because they are more directly 
based in the techniques which give them their logical foundation. 
This logical foundation is doubtless compensated by a certain 
sclerosis of the legal framework and by a certain stiffness of judicial 
will. If, moreover, because of the invasion of techniques the judicial 
factor exists apart from concrete problems, it comes under state 
control
There is, in addition, another problem: the perpetual problem of 
justice. Justice is no longer conceived of as a practical requirement 
vis-a-vis individual problems, but rather as a mere idea, an abstract
The Technologieal Society ( a 9 5
notion. Then it becomes simple to discard it entirely. Even so, men 
of law have certain scruples and are unable to eliminate justice 
from the law completely without twinges of conscience. But it is 
not possible to retain it because of the difficulties it involves, the 
uncertainty of operation and unpredictability it entails. In a word, 
judicial technique implies that bureaucracy cannot be burdened 
any longer with justice.
But, in that case, how shall another and newer meaning be given 
to the law? It is a remarkable fact that all societies which have 
arrived at a certain degree of state control and legal evolution 
have found the same answer to this question. In Egypt, in Rome 
in the fourth century after Christ, in fifteenth-century France, and 
in all of twentieth-century Western civilization, the concept of or­
der and security is substituted for justice as the end and foundation 
of law when judicial technique becomes sufficiently developed.
The formula then becomes: “Better injustice than disorder.” The 
notions of order and security are at least as easily reduced to tech­
nique as is the impossible notion of justice. One knows exactly what 
measures must be taken to achieve order. The definition of order 
may vary, but the means are always the same. One knows and is 
in a position to specify the conditions of legal security. Even though 
these means imply injustice, it is impossible to object, in view of the 
changeable character of the concept of justice. The more explicit 
judicial technique becomes, the more the law tends to ensure or­
der. This is, moreover, one of the major objectives of the state. 
Therefore, the law and the police become identical, for the law is 
no longer anything but an instrument of the state. At such a price 
judicial technique blossoms and yields its consequences. Today we 
are in a position to study this phenomenon in all its vigor.
At most, a possible inconsistency in the laws (to which the need 
for order constrains the state) might trouble the conscience of 
jurists. But since there is no longer any foundation of law in justice, 
legal inconsistency cannot have any very far-reaching effects or 
endanger the judicial technique.
The schematism I have described is found over and over again 
behind the complexity of modem legal phenomena. Under such 
conditions the traditional equilibrium between the technical and 
human elements is quickly lost. In affirming that there is no law 
without efficiency, we in fact announce the implicit sacrifice of jus-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE*S6)
tice and the human being to efficiency. With this lack of equi­
librium, the door is wide open to further technical invasion. We are 
witnessing the result— the takeover of law by technique— among 
nations which have a less firmly rooted legal sense than the French.
Until now I have been speaking of judicial technique still as a 
recognizable part of the world of law. The jurist, although turned 
technician, adhered to a general line which prevented technique 
from reaching a “pure” state. But once the pure technical men­
tality, technique-in-itself, has penetrated the legal world, legal 
technique, which no longer has its roots in law but in the physical 
sciences or perhaps even in biology, brings about certain decisive 
upheavals in social life. The technician rejects both the school of 
natural law and the historical school, so that, according to 
F. Jiinger, the law becomes merely a complex of technical norms. 
The demands of conscience, as well as those of society ( to use the 
traditional language), become subordinated to normative tech­
nique. It is no longer considered necessary to secure popular ad­
herence to law or to be limited to legal means in order to secure 
the application of law. The enormous simplicity of technique has 
deprived the whole ensemble of judicial mechanisms of meaning—  
mechanisms which had as their end to guarantee the law and to 
cause it to be obeyed without excessive use of force. The whole 
apparatus of devices such as penalties, distraints, and the like, no 
longer makes sense. There is no need of such finesse. Adherence and 
obedience are secured by extralegal means (among which the po­
lice are very often the most innocuous).
We are today in the process of transcending the traditional posi­
tion. That is to say, law ensures order instead of justice. Hans 
ICelsen represents the culmination of this development; and it was 
expressed ii, certain of tire legal forms of nariiuu. x ne itszis recog­
nized that a science of human behavior would make it possible to 
dispense with many legal rules. If the people to be administered 
were “persuaded,” if they were made to understand by sufficiently 
powerful means that the observation of the rule was in their own 
interest, that rule would become more and more useless. If a suf­
ficiently functional, realistic, and coherent pattern is established for 
the organized human milieu (and the technique of organization can 
furnish such a plan in short order), a great part of the administra­
tive apparatus is rendered superfluous. In this way society is di-
The Technological Society (297
rected toward a progressive emptying of legal forms and a conse­
quent gain in the human techniques which render a gendarmery 
useless.
A further consequence of the technicization of the law is that the 
distinction between political technique and judicial technique dis­
appears, for all practical purposes. The subject and object of the 
law are no longer social, but rather technical, exigencies. The 
technician approves of proceeding in this way: the very matter of 
law becomes his object. He has good reason to desire such a situa­
tion. He is no longer burdened with absurd methods of procedure. 
His judgments become completely rational since he understands 
the social necessities and the economic situation and can take them 
into account in his calculations. But it should not be thought that 
the technician merely translates these necessities into law. Above 
all, he elaborates them, and they are essentially subordinate to him 
and his technique.
This explains the enormous proliferation of laws. The technician 
analyzes and predicts; he cannot endure the indeterminate or tol­
erate any initiative which upsets order. These two traits explain the 
multiplicity of laws. In the past, this multiplicity was attributed 
to inefficiency. The repeated promulgation of a law, or the indefi­
nite multiplication of laws, accentuated the fact that laws were 
going unobserved. Legal multiplicity today is something else 
again. Whatever a technician believes is true must be made into 
law. But his inferences only concern details. His analytic spirit 
leads him to perceive, understand, and affirm strictly localized 
truths; and thus strictly delimited, they then become the objects 
of law. There must be a law for each fact; whence the indefinite 
proliferation of the legal apparatus.
The modem proliferation of laws can also be explained by the 
legal technician’s complete antipathy to the notion of a doctrinal 
law, to a jurisprudence of “concepts.” A legal system which merely 
establishes principles and lays down general lines of procedure 
entrusts to the judge the creation of the living law under the 
maxim praetor viva vox juris civilis.* Such a state of affairs is in­
tolerable to the technician, who dreads above all else the arbitrary,
•"The magistrate is the real voice of the civil law." M. Ellul points out elsewhere 
to what a degree Roman law depended on the magistrate's interpretation of very 
general, not to say vague, legal maxims. (Trans.)
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE298)
the personal, and the fortuitous. The technician is the great enemy 
of chance; he finds the personal element insupportable. For that 
reason he finds it advisable to enclose the judge or the administrator 
in a tighter and tighter technical network, more and more hedged 
about with legal prescriptions, in such a way that the citizen will 
understand exactly where he is heading and just what conse­
quences are to be expected.
Law, then, must provide for every contingency, so that man can­
not disturb its operation. The traditional development of law in­
volved a kind of competition between judges and crooks; but with 
the progress of technique, this is no longer the case. Society, 
through the application of extralegal means, is beginning to guar­
antee public obedience to the law. Its real problem now is to 
restrain the activities of those who would apply the law only to 
distort it, from the judge down to the lowest prison guard.
The smallest detail must therefore be invested with the majesty of 
the law: after all, law concerns an organized society. The law of 
persons, for example, is now the law of persons technically or­
ganized. Even property law has been profoundly modified by the 
disturbances to which technique has subjected property owner­
ship. We see once more that all the fundamental technical data 
verify and reinforce one another.
As to the consequences, I believe they may be reduced to two: 
law becomes a mere instrument of the state; and, in the end, law 
disappears. The first of these statements is in no way connected 
with a general theory of law. I am not saying that the essence of 
law is reduced to the will of the state. I confine myself to the ob­
servation of facts. When the law becomes technical, it must be 
formulated on the basis of technical methods; it is necessary to 
propound an “edict” from some center (exactly as in the Latin 
e-dicere). Technical law implies a close relation with the state; 
and the more technical the law becomes, the more this relation be­
comes exclusive of all but technical content. The movement is rein­
forced by the fact that the state simultaneously becomes technical 
too.
This concordant development results in an actual identification 
(apart from any doctrinal position) of the expression of the law 
with some purely administrative proceeding. It is always possible, 
of course, to affirm the supremacy of aspects of the law other than
The Technological Society (299
its actual expression; they are completely detached from reality, 
being separated from it by a formidable arsenal of strictly adminis­
trative texts and the specific turn of the technical mentality. The 
law at present is an affair of the state. The state, whenever it ex­
presses itself, makes law. There are no longer any norms to regulate 
the activity of the state; it has eliminated the moral rules that 
judged it and absorbed the legal rules that guided it. The state is 
a law unto itself and recognizes no rules but its own will. When, in 
this way, technique breaks off the indispensable dialogue between 
the law and the state, it makes the state a god in the most theologi­
cally accurate sense of the term: a power which obeys nothing but 
its own will and submits to no judgment from without. This godlike 
will of the state is for modern man the most precise expression of 
technique.
In the second place, we are witnessing the disappearance of the 
law in the legal proliferation described. This dissolution is notable 
in two things, the loss by the law of its end and of its domain.
In connection with the first point, law, whether we like it or 
not, is dependent on justice. This is no arbitrary affirmation; fur­
ther, I do not have in mind a justice which is subject to all manner 
of intellectual tortures. When law is detached from justice, it be­
comes a compass without a needle. The substitution of order for 
justice, useful though this may be for the purpose of making law 
technical, itself quickly becomes a contributory factor in this dis­
sociation. For what does order signify? In effect, the same thing as 
efficiency. Law must assure order. Order is the application of the 
will of the state. Law must be efficient. Efficiency is itself order. 
Once more we witness a general transformation of means into ends. 
Law thus becomes an activity without any end and without any 
meaning. It is efficient for efficiency’s sake; and individual laws are 
conceived solely with a view to being efficient. The whole func­
tional theory of law is in accord with this. The idea that every man 
has a function in society, that the law exists to give him the means 
of fulfilling this function and to see to it that he does fulfill it, rep­
resents justice in abstracto. The idea is not new; it dominated the 
whole of medieval law. What is new (and is in process of com­
pletely changing the meaning of the idea of function) is the rela­
tion between function and technique. Law no longer poses the 
problem of the finality of man’s functions. Law no longer co-
300)  TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
ordinates man’s functions in their relation to justice. As soon as that 
function is keyed to technique, it becomes valid in and of itself. 
Everyone’s function, once it has become technical, finds in tech­
nique its meaning and validity; its proper results and destiny are of 
little importance. The law has become a mere organizer of indi­
vidual functions. It thus constitutes only a part of the larger science 
of social relations and connections.
This development is clearly taking place today in property law, 
contract law, and so on; similarly it is contributing to the dissolu­
tion of the law. Traditionally, there was a specific domain of law 
which could easily be defined, for example, by comparing different 
legal systems, present and past. Legal domain always remained 
the same; today, however, the frontiers have expanded. It is no 
longer possible to distinguish between what is law and what is 
not. Every application of technique to the social sphere becomes 
part of the domain of law. A clear example of this is the problem 
of planning: the true legal domain, today, is that of planning. 
Everything affected by planning must be transformed into law. 
The domain of law is therefore no longer defined by object or by 
end, but by method.
This transition represents a triumph of technique. No longer is the 
preoccupation of the law and justice its measure. The law’s con­
cern is to apply new means to all accessible areas. The very being 
of the law is thus dissolved. In itself the law has come to represent 
nothing but a terminology and a travesty on tradition which hap­
pens to be useful to the new lords and masters. People who today 
hold the law in contempt are at least not deceived by false im­
pressions. Nevertheless, in consenting to be robbed in this way, 
man renounces one of his highest vocations.
Repercussion on Technique
It is not merely the state which is being transformed by the techni­
cal movement. For the past thirty-odd years, when the encounter 
between the state and technique has become more explicit, tech­
nique has developed with greater rapidity than ever before, not 
only according to its own internal logic but also with the aid of 
the power and support of the state. The advantages of private
The Technological Society (301
and public techniques have complemented each other in such a 
way as virtually to cancel out the inconveniences of either. W e 
have seen, for example, that the immobility to which the technique 
of the state tends is compensated for by the activities of private 
techniques— initiative remaining with the individual even when 
private technique has become state technique.
But we must admit that the state’s appropriation of technique 
has dispelled much of technique’s familiar magical appeal. Man 
is gradually losing his illusions about technique and his bedazzle- 
ment with it. He is becoming aware that he has not created an in­
strument of freedom but a new set of chains; this appears with 
compelling clarity when the state exploits technical instruments. 
Man, however, is still not willing to believe in the reality of this 
new situation^ he tends to reject, above and beyond bad techni­
cal uses and doctrines, the results of this conjunction between 
state and technique.
But this rejection is the result of an oversimplification. It is tech­
nique itself which has changed. Either that, or it has followed its 
own law, a law man was ignorant of at the beginning of this glo­
rious era. In any case, man sees that technique has changed, but 
he is unwilling to examine it too closely for fear of losing his last 
hopes.
Technique Unchecked. At present there is no counterbalance to 
technique. In a society in equilibrium, every new cultural tend­
ency, every new impulse, encounters a certain number of obstacles 
which act as the society’s first line of defense. This is not due to 
the interplay of conservative and revolutionary forces in general, 
nor in particular to the play between the means of production and 
the organs of consumption. It is rather due to the simple fact that 
every new factor must be integrated into the cultural framework, 
and this process requires a certain period of time because it en­
tails modifications of the two interacting elements. It is never 
initially clear that the new factor will be acceptable to the cultural 
complex. On one hand is a kind of process of selection and, on 
the other, a resistance that gradually abates. A number of different 
forces play this restraining role. I shall discuss four of them.
The first is morality. Every civilization has rules of precise con­
duct, which are covered by the term morality in either its French 
or its Anglo-Saxon meaning. They may be conscious and thought
302 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
out, or unconscious and spontaneous. They determine what is good 
and what is bad and, consequently, admit or reject a given in­
novation.
Very close to morality, public opinion comprises a set of much 
more irrational reactions which are not necessarily related to good 
and evil. For reasons still poorly understood, public opinion may 
be impelled in a certain direction under the influence of a given 
impulse, or it may remain refractory. Obviously, public opinion 
is decisive in the interaction between morality and a new factor. 
It can render morality obsolete or lead it to triumph.
A third restraining force is social structure, which includes both 
social morphology and economic or legal structure. The social 
structure reacts strongly whenever new factors threaten to modify 
it. (This, incidentally, is the only one of the four factors retained 
by Marxism.) Systems or ideas are no longer the sole operative 
factors; economic relations or sociological factors can disturb the 
equilibrium even of a situation the stability of which was pre­
viously thought assured.
Finally, there is the state, the special organ of defense of a 
society, which reacts with every means at its disposal against all 
disturbing forces.
We may now ask what position we are in today with respect to 
these factors insofar as technique is concerned. Let us put aside 
the problem of morality and concern ourselves with public opin­
ion It is completely oriented in favor of technique; only technical 
phenomena interest modern men. The machine has made itself 
master of the heart and brain both of the average man and of the 
mob. What excites the crowd? Performance— whether perform- 
ailP P  In  s n o r ts  (th ft r e s u lt  o f  a  P flr t a in  S irn rtin er fgcbziiQUS) O rA  '  '  “  *  O  1  /
economic performance (as in the Soviet Union), in reality these 
are the same thing. Technique is the instrument of performance. 
What is important is to go higher and faster, the object of the 
performance means little. The act is sufficient unto itself. Modem 
man can think only in terms of figures, and the higher the figures, 
the greater his satisfaction. He looks for nothing beyond the mar­
velous escape mechanism that technique has allowed him, to off­
set the very repressions caused by the life technique forces him 
to lead. He is reduced, in the process, to a near nullity. Even if
The Technological Society (303
he is not a worker on the assembly line, his share of autonomy and 
individual initiative becomes smaller and smaller. He is constrained 
and repressed in thought and action by an omnivorous reality 
which is external to him and imposed upon him. He is no longer 
permitted to display any personal power. Then, suddenly, he 
learns that the airplane his factory manufactures has flown at 700 
miles an hour! All his repressed power soars into flight in that 
figure. Into that record speed he sublimates everything that was 
repressed in himself. He has gone one step further toward fusion 
with the mob, for it is the mob as a whole that is moved by a 
performance that incarnates its will to power. Every modem man 
expresses his will to power in records he has not established him­
self.
Public opinion is all the more important in that it is a two­
pronged element. In the first place, there is modem man’s col­
lective worship of the power of fact, which is displayed in every 
technique and which is manifested in his total devotion to its over­
whelming progress. This adoration is not passive but truly mys­
tical. Men sacrifice themselves to it and lose themselves in the 
search for it. In this sense Mussolini was right in speaking of men 
realizing themselves in and through the state, the collective in­
strument of power. The martyrs of science or of the air force or 
of the atomic pile give us the most profound sense of this worship 
when we see the deference the crowd pays them. “I have faith 
in technique,” declared Henry Wallace, the former Secretary of 
Commerce of the United States. His faith indeed dwells in men’s 
hearts. Man is scandalized when he is told that technique causes 
evil; the scourges engendered by one technique will be made good 
by still other techniques. This is society’s normal attitude.
In the second place, there is the deep conviction that technical 
problems are the only serious ones. The amused glance people 
give the philosopher; the lack of interest displayed in metaphysi­
cal and theological questions (“Byzantine” quarrels); the rejec­
tion of the humanities which comes from the conviction that we 
are living in a technical age and education must correspond to it; 
the search for the immediately practical, carrying the implication 
that history is useless and can serve no practical ends— all these are 
symptomatic of that “reasonable” conviction which pervades the
304 ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
social hierarchy and is identical for all social classes. "Only tech­
nique is not mere gab.” It is positive and brings about real achieve­
ments.
In these two ways, the mystic and the rational, public opinion is 
completely oriented toward technique. And at present another pre­
cise technique molds public opinion with reference to any given 
question. This technique has never been fully exploited because 
public opinion is favorable enough to technique without it. But if 
a sudden change should occur and public opinion should turn 
against technique, we would see the propaganda machinery set into 
motion to re-create a favorable atmosphere, for the whole social 
edifice would be at stake.
As to the third traditional restraining force— the social structure 
— the question is whether the social structure of our world acts as a 
brake on technical evolution. By way of answer, I have shown that 
progress has been rapid only because social morphology has fa­
vored it. This phenomenon has not fluctuated very much; and at 
present we are witnessing the penetration of social structure by 
techniques. The life of the modem world is to an ever greater 
degree dominated by economics, and economics in turn is more and 
more dominated by technique. The whole of the material world in 
which we live rests on this technical base. (It is a commonplace of 
science-fiction writers to imagine what would happen if the use of 
technical instruments were to be suddenly stopped.) Likewise, our 
analysis has led us to recognize that as technique progresses in a 
given society, it tends to reproduce in that society the social struc­
tures that gave birth to it
The individualist and atomized society of the nineteenth cen­
tury was, from the sociological point of view, favorable to technical 
development. Today we are witnessing a kind of technical recon­
stitution of the scattered fragments of society; communities and 
associations flourish everywhere. Men seem overjoyed at this crea­
tion of new social frameworks independent of the state. The social 
solidification of today contrasts sharply with the fluidity of the 
nineteenth century. Does this phenomenon then present an effec­
tive opposition to techniques? The answer must be in the negative. 
If we examine these new sociological forms in detail, we find them 
all organized as functions of techniques. We hardly need to ex­
amine industrial associations, but the same applies to all other
The Technological Society (305
twentieth-century associations. They may be associations for sport 
or for culture, the goal of which is clearly recognizable (Dickson). 
They may be labor unions, which have their characteristic relation 
to life through the economy, this last being conditioned by tech­
nique. They may be communities like the Kibbutzim, whose object 
is to exploit techniques while allowing man a normal life. In every 
kind of modem society there is a predominance of techniques. The 
social morphology of these societies indeed differs radically from 
that of traditional societies. Traditional societies were centered 
upon human needs and instincts (for example, in family, clan, 
seignory). Modem societies, on the other hand, are centered on 
technical necessity and derivatively, of course, on human adher­
ence. Man, in modem societies, is not situated in relation to other 
men, but in relation to technique; for this reason the sociological 
structure of these societies is completely altered. There is no 
longer any question of autonomous collectivities or groups with 
specific values and orientations. Modem collectivities and groups 
have no existence beyond technique— they are representative of 
the major tendency of our time.
In the transition from the individualist to the collectivist society, 
there are then two stages of evolution, both of which are favorable 
to technique, not two different attitudes of society toward tech­
nique. Comparably, it is clear that collectivist society cannot be 
established, or even conceived of, except as growing out of an ex­
treme technical development. This might not be true in a com­
munal society (although the communities that exist today are 
markedly dependent on technique); but we do not seem to be mov­
ing in the direction of such societies.
Hence, we must conclude that our social structures, viewed m 
any light whatsoever, are unanimously favorable to technique and 
could hardly act as a check upon it.
Only the state remains, then, as a possible brake upon technique. 
But we have already seen that the state has abdicated this function, 
renouncing its directive role in favor of technique. Indeed, since 
the nineteenth century every social element which traditionally 
acted as a restraint on innovating forces has been overthrown as far 
as technique is concerned. Inverted might be a better term; the 
factors which formerly acted as hindrances have today become 
powerful auxiliaries to technique. (W e have only to reflect on pub-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 0 6 )
lie opinion and the expansion of the economy to realize this.) Tech­
nique, therefore, encounters no possible obstacles or checks to its 
progress. It can advance as it will, since it encounters no limiting 
factors other than its own powers (which seem unlimited and in­
exhaustible).
A technique without limits is not in itself disquieting. If we look 
at our technical society without our idealist spectacles, what seems 
most disquieting is that the character of technique renders it inde­
pendent of man himself. We do not mean by this that the machine 
tends to replace the human being; that fact is already well-known. 
The important thing is that man, practically speaking, no longer 
possesses any means of bringing action to bear upon technique. 
He is unable to limit it or even to orient it. I am well acquainted 
with the claims of those who think that society has technique 
under firm control because man is always inventing it anew. I 
know too of the hopes of those who are always prescribing reme­
dies for this sorcerer’s apprentice whom they feel free to invoke 
without discernment. But these claims and hopes are mere words. 
The reality is that man no longer has any means with which to 
subjugate technique, which is not an intellectual, or even, as some 
would have it, a spiritual phenomenon. It is above all a sociological 
phenomenon; and in order to cure or change it, one would have to 
oppose to it checks and barriers of a sociological character. By 
such means alone man might possibly bring action to bear upon 
it. But everything of a sociological character has had its character 
changed by technique. There is, therefore, nothing of a sociologi­
cal character available to restrain technique, because everything 
in society is its servant. Technique is essentially independent of the 
human bem ** who finds himself naked and disarmed before it. 
Modern man divines that there is only one reasonable way out: to 
submit and take what profit he can from what technique otherwise 
so richly bestows upon him. If he is of a mind to oppose it, he finds 
himself really alone.
It has been said that modern man surrounded by techniques is in 
the same situation as prehistoric man in the midst of nature. This is 
only a metaphor; it cannot be carried very far, even though it is as 
exact as a metaphor can be. Both environments give life but both 
place him in utter peril. Both represent terrifying powers, worlds 
in which man is a participant but which are closed against him. In
The Technological Society (3 o 7
the joy of conquest, he has not perceived that what he has created 
takes from him the possibility of being himself. He is like a rich 
man of many possessions who finds himself a nonentity in his own 
household. The state, man’s last protector, has made common 
cause with alien powers.
The Role of the State in the Development of Modem Technique» . 
The state plays a role of prime importance with respect to tech­
niques. We have noted that until recently different techniques 
were unrelated to one another. This unrelatedness was true of state 
techniques because they were localized and their domains were 
not contiguous; it held for private techniques because they were 
the result of highly uncoordinated activity which, while fruitful, 
was also anarchical and was dominated, moreover, by specializa­
tion.
The basic effect of state action on techniques is to co-ordinate the 
whole complex. The state possesses the power of unification, since 
it is the planning power par excellence in society. In this it plays its 
true role, that of co-ordinating, adjusting, and equilibrating social 
forces. It has played this role with respect to techniques for half a 
century by bringing hitherto unrelated techniques into contact 
with one another, for example, economic and propaganda tech­
niques. It. relates them by establishing organisms responsible for 
this function, as, for example, the simple organs of liaison between 
ministries. It integrates the whole complex of techniques into a 
plan. Planning itself is the result of well-applied techniques, and 
only the state is in a position to establish plans which are valid on 
the national level. We are, at present, beginning to see plans on a 
continental scale, not only the so-called five-year plans, but the 
Marshall Plan and plans for assisting underdeveloped countries.
It is only in the framework of planning that such operations are 
arranged and find their exact place. The state appears less as the 
brain which orders them organically and more as the relational 
apparatus which enables the separate techniques to confront one 
another and to co-ordinate their movements. We find concrete 
evidence of this again and again; in the co-ordination of rail and 
automobile traffic, the co-ordination of the production of steel and 
motor vehicles and aircraft, in the co-ordination of the medical 
profession and social security, the co-ordination of foreign and 
colonial commerce, and of all commerce with finance, and so forth.
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE308)
The more closely related the different sectors, the more does a 
discovery in one involve repercussions in the others, and the more 
it becomes necessary to create organisms of transmission, cogs and 
gears, so to speak, connecting the different techniques. This is an 
impossible task for private enterprise, not only because the phe­
nomenon in question is a global one but because the technicians 
themselves are specialists. The state alone can undertake the in­
dispensable task of bridging these specializations. The state knows 
approximately the available resources in men and techniques and 
can undertake the still embryonic function of co-ordinator. Since 
discoveries in one technical sector are so useful in others, the role 
of co-ordinator is bound to become more and more important.
Consider, for example, the diversity of techniques necessary for 
the production of a motion picture. There are financial, literary, 
and cinematographic techniques; there are lesser techniques, such 
as make-up techniques and the techniques of light and sound. 
There are completely new techniques, such as script techniques, 
and so on. These cinematic techniques, though complicated, can 
be grasped by the brain of a single man, and hence there are still 
some cases of one-man management. But consider the magnitude 
of the task of co-ordinating, on a national scale, even more compli­
cated clusters of techniques which offer active resistance to being 
co-ordinated. In such cases the role of organizer, manager, co­
ordinator— whatever it is called— becomes more necessary in pro­
portion as the state takes over that function. Moreover, the state 
alone can fulfill it. This state of affairs is already a reality; the state 
is already engaged in bridging the isolated technical specialties. 
Individual specialized disciplines— for example, those of the biolo­
gist, the engineer, the sociologist, the psychologist— are combined 
to yield new techniques such as psychotechniques and industrial 
relations. But these individual disciplines are also joined together 
in a more organic way, as, for example, when the so-called human 
techniques, physics and politics, are combined in propaganda.
In addition to co-ordinating the different techniques, the state 
furnishes material means far beyond the power of any individ­
uals to supply. An expedition to the North Pole, which only a half 
century ago was within the resources of one or at most a few pri­
vate persons, is no longer possible on a private basis. Formerly all 
that was needed was Eskimo equipment, such as a boat, sledges,
The Technological Society (309
dogs— and, above all, courage. Today complicated mechanical 
equipment is necessary: airplanes (especially equipped for the 
cold and for ice landings), caterpillar trucks, radio and radio 
telephones, prefabricated housing, and so on. Every possible means 
to lessen danger is available to him who dreams of exploring un­
known territory. It would doubtless be possible to revive old tradi­
tions— by risking one's life. But why reject the new means? Why 
endanger one’s life when one can do a better job without that? 
Obviously, bravado is unreasonable. One must employ the maxi­
mum means to assure optimal results with the least danger. But no 
private person has the means to set into motion the enormous 
apparatus that is needed. The means must be requisitioned by the 
state, which alone is in a position to find indefinite supplies of 
cash and to exploit financial techniques forbidden to individuals. 
The same applies in submarine exploration. When one leaves the 
domain of the merely amateurish and desires to give one’s work 
status, legal or otherwise, it is necessary to solicit the support of the 
state to cover expenses and to resolve administrative problems.
But the state demands something in return for subventions. The 
state does not think it important for an individual to go to the 
North Pole, either for sport's sake or for honors. The state desires 
tangible technical results. It agrees to furnish assistance for pur* 
poses of scientific research and for the acquisition of certain rights 
it hopes to exploit; for example, mineral resources and aviation. 
The result must be the technical aggrandizement of the state; that 
is the only condition under which a contract between state and 
individual is possible.
That the state acts to promote scientific research is not new; in 
die eighteenth century the state offered recompenses to inventors, 
and these recompenses had much to do with the discovery of cer­
tain navigational methods (compensating chronometer, mathemat­
ical tables, and so on). The state thereafter seemed to lose interest, 
but for the last thirty years it has resumed the policy of recompens­
ing technologists and inventors.
There are multiple examples of this, for the modern state, to a 
greater degree than ever before, alone has the means to put to 
work what technique has to offer man. It suffices to mention agri­
cultural machinery, automatic threshers and reapers, and so on. 
Although in France this machinery is of comparatively small size.
3  1 0  ) TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE
it is, even so, far beyond the resources of the average individual 
fanner to buy. An intermediary is necessary, either a capitalist 
who leases machines to the farmers, or a farmer-co-operative 
which buys the machines. Yet both of these hesitate to invest the 
requisite capital because large-scale farm machinery is used only 
for a small part of the year and is idle the rest of the time. (Such 
machinery must therefore be deemed technically backward.) 
Airplanes are being used increasingly for sowing, seeding clouds 
for rain, distributing chemical substances, and so on. But these 
techniques exceed the resources of peasant co-operatives.
There are only two ways to resolve the situation. One is to ex­
propriate the land in favor of capitalist corporations which will ex­
ploit vast areas with the latest technical improvements. The other 
is to unite the farmers in state collective farms which would have 
at their disposal instruments furnished by the state. A choice is still 
possible between the two alternatives. But almost certainly the 
balance will swing in favor of state collectives; only through state 
collectives can technical progress be fully realized and technical 
means exploited without fear of financial setbacks.
The state offers technique possibilities of development which no 
Other agency could offer. It gives research men the necessary 
means to expedite their research, and, as a consequence, to expe­
dite technique. Only the state is in a position to make available to 
scientists the results of scientific investigations from other parts of 
the world; the state can exploit information techniques which no 
lesser agency could possibly exploit. It can buy necessary new 
instruments in any country. It even lures foreign scientists into its 
laboratories with hard cash (it may even kidnap them into semi­
slavery, as in the case of the German scientists who were “distrib­
uted” among the victorious Allies). Only the state can purchase 
essential scientific equipment and, in addition, give the scientist 
the indispensable support of its authority.
Technique, as I have remarked, has no meaning if it is not ap­
plied. But in its application it encounters certain concrete difficul­
ties, especially with individuals. This in no way contradicts what 
I have already said about public opinion. Public opinion is com­
pletely and resolutely favorable to technical progress. But it is fa­
vorable retrospectively, so to speak. Technical progress is what 
we already know. In actual instances, however— in respect to some
The Technological Society (311
new discovery, for example— the reaction of the public is not so 
simple. If a discovery does not concern the public directly, its re­
action is generally enthusiastic, as, for example, in the case of 
supersonic aircraft. But if the public is directly affected, if the dis­
covery may in fact be applied to it, enthusiasm is notably dimin­
ished, the more so because there is always a difference of opinion 
among the technicians themselves. Here the state intervenes. In 
innumerable cases it has had to resolve the quarrels of technicians 
and scientists, as formerly it resolved the debates of theologians. 
Recall the strife concerning the antitubercular vaccines of Cal­
mette and Guerin; also the reservations of some scientists concern­
ing the “polyvalent vaccination” which is now obligatory in France. 
The state alone decided what was to be done in these cases. More­
over, the state clothed its opinion in its authority, which, in a short 
time, became the authority of the technician. Where necessary, 
authority was reinforced by compulsion. A complicated system 
developed. The child who has not been vaccinated cannot be ad­
mitted to school; and the child who does not attend school has no 
right to family subsidies. Thus the state overcomes the objections 
of individuals to technical progress. Friedmann writes: “It is 
clear that in a society in which the psychotechnician’s important 
task is not invested with the authority of the state . . .  his position 
is ambiguous and his recommendations do not always have the 
weight they should.” And Friedmann goes on to remark that state 
authority frees technique from the grip of private persons. 
Through the authority of the state, technique is no longer at the 
service of private interests; and this gives the state, if not real 
freedom, at least additional justification.
The authority with which the state invests technique becomes 
a factor in its development. But it ought not to be forgotten that 
this state has itself become technical; it does not act on whim. 
Institutions in the Service of Technique. The state then proceeds 
to create organs to meet the demands of technique, and here arise a 
number of possibilities.
The system created in France involves a certain decentralization. 
The CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research) is fairly au­
tonomous. But it is necessary right off to dispel a misunderstanding. 
The name includes the word scientific, but the work of the Center is 
is above all ebe technical. However, the persons who created and
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 * * )
who champion the work of the Center associate the two concepts 
very closely. Consider the statement of Louis de Broglie and 
Frederic Joliot-Curie: “For France it is not a question of maintain­
ing scientific and technical research in spite of the fact that the na­
tion is poor; it is a question of developing it, precisely because the 
nation is poor." This statement, incidentally, confirms my conclu­
sion about the exploitation of the nation by the technicians. Scien­
tific research is justified in a poor country because it produces 
certain techniques which permit more complete use of the coun­
try’s resources.
This sheds light on the real meaning of scientific work. Science 
is becoming more and more subordinate to the search for technical 
application. Numerous scientists, who are attached to the labora­
tories of the CNRS and with whom I am personally acquainted, 
have confirmed to me its preoccupation with results and its empha­
sis on technical investigations. The CNRS is not an institution for 
disinterested and objective research nor is it a purely cultural 
entity. It represents a further step toward the union between the 
scientific and the technical. We must recognize, however, that the 
French state still does not understand exactly what is to be ex­
pected from this union.
The politicians distrust the technicians; the petty war which is 
being fought between them over the CNRS is another example of 
the competition I have described. Biquard, chef de cabinet of the 
Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research, has written that 
the reason lor which the CNRS ought to remain independent of the 
National Ministry of Education is that “The tasks of the CNRS—  
recruitment, training, equipment, co-ordination, organization, and 
management— are sufficiently heavy to justify the existence of an 
administration appropriate to scientific research; an administration 
in which scientists ought to play the most important role.”
This quotation discloses two things: first, that this state organ 
performs with respect to technique precisely the functions we have 
already indicated: co-ordination, organization, and management; 
second, that in it technicians must play the principal role, to the 
exclusion of politicians represented by the National Ministry of 
Education.
But the creation of the CNRS is clearly only a first step. It repre­
sents a commitment; and i t is impossible to stop there. The demo-
The Technological Society (3*3
cratic state has proved to be clearly unequal to the task of develop­
ing techniques, and the CNRS does not have the prestige or the 
means it would possess in an authoritarian state. In comparison 
with the authoritarian state, of course, the CNRS is still relatively 
free in its activities and its research. Although its general orienta­
tion is toward the technical application of discoveries, certain pos­
sibilities ( incidentally, more and more restricted) are still left men 
for pure research which cannot in principle terminate in immedi­
ate application. The well-known margin of unpredictability in 
research is thus protected. Which discoveries are susceptible of 
applicability is never known in advance. Research is blind; it ad­
vances gropingly and by means of a thousand experiments which 
miscarry. One experiment will make a breach and allow an ex­
plosive technical advance. But the thousand fruitless experiments 
were nevertheless necessary. We recognize this. But— and this is 
the important thing— technical exigence is dead set against science 
in this respect, because technique cannot tolerate the gropings and 
slowtempoof science.
We have already examined the requirement of immediate appli­
cability; here we meet it again on the state level. The state is not 
disinterested any more than private capitalists, but it is concerned 
in a different way. The state claims to represent the public interest 
and hence to have the duty of being a “good manager,” dispensing 
the public revenues only on condition that they mean something, 
that they pay off. Disinterested activity on the part of the state is 
inconceivable. Some may say that such activity should not be im­
possible; but in fact it is impossible. Neither individuals nor public 
opinion nor the structure of the state is oriented toward the ac­
ceptance of the kind of culture pure scientific research would 
represent.
The state demands that anything scientific enter into the line of 
“normal” development, not only for the sake of the public interest 
but also because of its will to power. We have previously noted 
that this will to power has found in technique an extraordinary 
means of expression. The state quickly comes to demand that tech­
nique keep its promises and be an effective servant of state power. 
Everything not of direct interest to this drive for power appears 
valueless. Just as financiers seek their interest in money profit, the 
state seeks it in power. In neither case is the motivation disinter-
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE3 *4 )
ested; technical discovery must pay off. Capitalists and state alike 
become impatient at delays in research, at experiments which a 
priori "lead to nothing,” and at the “uncertainty” of the scientist 
when he indulges in pure research without knowing in advance 
which research will pay off and which will not. Moreover, the 
tendency is to eliminate from the legitimate concerns of the state 
all sciences that have no immediate practical application: history, 
philosophy, grammar, and so on.
In the case of sciences susceptible of practical application, there 
is an immediate demand for this application. This is, of course, un­
favorable to science; but it must not be imagined that it is the work
of imbeciles.
The state begins by assigning a precise task to scientific research, 
issuing directives to the effect that it must find solutions for certain 
pressing problems, for example, a more rapid method to produce a 
part of a machine, a jet engine for aircraft, and so on. These direc­
tives are veritable commands to scientific research to summon all 
its resources to solve the problems as soon as possible. In a demo­
cratic system there are no sanctions against scientists who fail to 
fulfill the state’s demands, except suppression of financial support 
A dictatorial regime, however, goes very much further to secure 
the compliance of the scientists. Even though it still leaves a rather 
broad area to personal initiative, it nevertheless tends more and 
more to become specific on this score. This is evident in different 
ways both in the Soviet Union and in the United States.
In the Soviet Union the Academy of Sciences appears to be the 
state organism which directs research and determines the frame­
work in which scientific activities will be carried out. The Acad­
emy constitutes the "general staff of the army of technicians.” 
Article %  of the statutes, definitively fixed in 1935, charged it with 
providing for the “progress of the theoretical and applied sciences." 
But the technical sciences administered by the Soviet Academy 
have ceaselessly outstripped the theoretical sciences. The Acad­
emy plans the course of research and assigns objectives to the in­
stitutes. On the initiative of the Academy, the education of higher 
technicians has been accelerated; in i960 the Soviet Union claimed 
to have 7,500,000 technicians of all classes. The Academy directs 
more than twenty institutes for research in applied science, em-
The Technological Society (315
ploying altogether 2,000 researchers. One of its institutes 
(the Institute for Information) is charged with collating the tech­
nical publications of the entire world; for this task alone it employs 
2,000 people full-time. All this makes it clear that the Academy 
plays an important role in technical activities. The system, how­
ever is on the whole poorly understood. It would appear to 
be less authoritarian than the Nazi system. But one should not 
forget the decision of the state, on the initiative of the Communist 
Party, in the Lysenko affair. Here the state, faced with two op­
posed biogenetic theories, decided for scarcely scientific reasons 
that Lysenko’s theory was true and ordered its application forth­
with.
The Gosplan,’ whose function is essentially to co-ordinate new 
scientific elements, is closely related to the Academy. The Gosplan 
is kept informed by the Academy about technical discoveries, and 
maintains a central file of all data of economic and statistical tech­
niques. In this way, a systematic and rational evaluation of scien­
tific research is possible, the results of which are then integrated 
into the state plan itself. In the reform of 1946, in which co-ordinat­
ing bureaus took the place of the former district offices, a technical 
bureau was set up whose function was to plan scientific research. 
At present this research is being directed on the basis of the over-all 
plan and of the needs of the state, and the whole is evaluated from 
the point of view of the individual techniques. The technical bur­
eau channels research by distributing financial credit of great 
magnitude; for example, in 1949 it allocated approximately 10 
billion rubles to scientific research, a sum equivalent to 20 per cent 
of all budgeted industrial investment.
The organization of scientific research in the United States is still 
far from complete. There are, in principle, private entities which 
perform research in all imaginable domains— such as the various 
committees for political research, committees for social research, 
and so on. In addition, there are entities for gathering and evaluat­
ing statistics, for polling public opinion, and for the study of policy. 
Closer and closer relations are being established among these en­
tities, which for the most part have been set up either by private
* The Soviet State Planning Agency. ( Trans.)
TECHNIQUE AND TH E STATE3 * 6 )
industry or by the state and then attached to the universities. 
(Seventy per cent of these entities have been set up by the large 
corporations.)
It is standard procedure for public services in need of informa­
tion to have recourse to these research centers. Specialized bureaus 
have also been set up to handle relations between research organi­
zations and the public services. These bureaus receive requests in 
all areas (agricultural, industrial, and so on) and orient research. 
Subsequently, they act as transmission media for discoveries, and 
study the possibilities of technical adaptation. Then the appro­
priate administrations are in a position to make contracts with the 
industrialists charged with practical implementation.
Technical operations of this kind and scope become more and 
more necessary as the state finances technical investigations to a 
greater and greater degree. The state is compelled to finance re­
search which exceeds the financial means of, say, the universities. 
The state has direct interest, therefore, in such institutions; it will 
therefore not leave unexploited the possibilities thus uncovered. 
All this means a much freer movement among government, in­
dustry, and technical research centers than would otherwise be the 
case.
In addition, the American state has organized research services 
of its own. The Bureau of the Census, for example, encompasses 
more than fifteen centers of statistical studies. The National Re­
sources Planning Board, which existed from 1923 to was an­
other such center. There are today other much more specialized 
agencies, the most comprehensive of which is the Atomic Energy 
Commission. The government owns the laboratories and furnishes 
the raw materials and equipment, but the actual research of the 
Commission is conducted by universities and by private industry. 
The Associated Universities, Inc., operates the Brookhaven National 
Laboratories; Union Carbide operates Oak Ridge; the University 
of California operates Los Alamos; and General Electric operates 
the center at Hanford.
Finally, it might be mentioned that the United States feels a  
strong need to co-ordinate the research carried out by the different 
agencies. Two associations seem fitted for this operation, the Public 
Service Administration and the Government Research Association. 
In due course, the work of these agencies will result in the realiza-
The Technological Society ( 3 1 7
tion of a project which is already underway: the creation of a cen­
ter of scientific research oriented toward technical goals, a Federal 
Research Board.
In principle, it is still possible for science to be independent 
But we must take note that the state calls on the best scientists for 
its research (in the United States, scientists are eager to work for 
the state, in view of the tow salaries paid university professors); 
that these scientists, in view of the state’s heavy demands, have 
little time to do anything else; and that the state employs an ever 
increasing number of them. Moreover, the greatest part of the 
funds devoted by corporations to research goes into technical re­
search. Only 4 per cent goes into basic scientific research. When, 
after the Steelman report of 1947 and certain public statements of 
Einstein, it seemed indispensable to promote scientific research, the 
state was appealed to, and in 1951 the state created the National 
Science Foundation. When, in the wake of the Sputnik, a new 
report (the Waterman report) made a new appeal for state inter­
vention, the state responded by creating the post of an adviser to 
the President for science and technology, a National Scientific 
Committee, and so on. These events imply a greater and greater de­
gree of intervention. Scientific and technical competition between 
the United States and the Soviets must inevitably produce centrali­
zation and growth of political power in the United States. It seems 
impossible therefore that independent research can survive; a sys­
tem such as Zweckwissenschaft (“practical or purposive science," 
which the Nazis applied too soon) will gradually take over. In it 
there is no longer any question of free research. The state mobilizes 
all technicians and scientists, and imposes on all a precise and 
limited technical objective. It forces them to specialize to a greater 
and greater degree, and remains itself the ordering force behind 
the specialists. It forbids all research which it deems not to be in 
its own interests and institutes only that research which has utility. 
Everything is subordinated to the idea of service and utility. Ends 
are known in advance; science only furnishes the means.
In Zweckwissenschaft the development of technique reaches its 
highest point, to the detriment of science. What is socially most 
important is the prohibition of all research other than that willed 
by the state. But in view of the conjunction of state and technique, 
the situation could hardly have been otherwise, and on the whole.
TECHNIQUE AND THE STATE318)
it cannot be said that the system ha* yielded poor results. Argu­
ments to the contrary could doubtless be drawn from the Nazi sup­
pression of research in the area of radar, to take one example. The 
Nazi government forbade research on short radio waves because 
it thought such inquiry had no future and could not be applied. 
Great Britain’s "free” research in this area, however, led to the 
creation of radar and represented a great setback for the Nazis’ 
Zweckwissenschaft, a setback which had important consequences 
for the war. On the other hand, the Nazis’ “directed” research 
produced impressive results. In the case of tanks, V i and V2 
missiles, and the heavy water bomb, in the fields of surgery, optics, 
and chemistry (not to speak of organization or agricultural meth­
ods), Zweckwissenschaft seems to have had rapid and efficient 
results. And after the war, the United States and the Soviet Union 
took these inventions and profited from them.
The lesson is not lost. We too are advancing progressively to­
ward this conception, which may in the long run prove to be 
ruinous despite the dazzling fireworks it produces today.
In view of what has been said, it may be affirmed with confidence 
that, in the decades to come, technique will become stronger and 
its pace will be accelerated through the agency of the state. The 
state and technique— increasingly interrelated— are becoming the 
most important forces in the modern world; they buttress and re­
inforce each other in their aim to produce an apparently indestructi­
ble, total civilization.

HUMAN
TECHNIQUES
The last techniques to make their appearance are those which re­
late directly to the human being. They are today the subject of 
great discoveries— and great hopes. We hear everywhere: “They 
will save everything.” Before we study them, let us inquire why 
they have appeared.
Necessities
Human Tension. Never before has so much been required of the 
human being. By chance, in the course of history some men have 
had to perform crushing labors or expose themselves to mortal 
periL But those men were slaves or warriors. Never before has the 
human race as a whole had to exert such efforts in its daily labors 
as it does today as a result of its absorption into the monstrous 
technical mechanism— an undifferentiated but complex mechanism 
which makes it impossible to turn a wheel without the sustained, 
persevering, and intensive labor of millions of workers, whether in 
white collars or in blue. The tempo of man’s work is not the tradi-
HUM AN TECHNIQUES320)
tional, ancestral tempo; nor is its aim the handiwork which man 
produced with pride, the handiwork in which he contemplated and 
recognized himself.
I shall not write (after all, so many others already have) about 
the difference between conditions of work today and in the past—  
how today’s work is less fatiguing and of shorter duration, on the 
one hand, but, on the other, is an aimless, useless, and callous busi­
ness, tied to a clock, an absurdity profoundly felt and resented by 
the worker whose labor no longer has anything in common with 
what was traditionally called work.
This is true today even for the peasantry. The important thing, 
however, is not that work is in a sense harsher than formerly, but 
that it calls for different qualities in man. It implies in him an ab­
sence, whereas previously it implied a presence. This absence is 
active, critical, efficient; it engages the whole man and supposes 
that he is subordinated to its necessity and created for its ends.
This is the first time in history that man has been so affected in 
so many untraditional ways. Carried along by events, he has been 
plunged into war at periodic intervals. But today’s war is total war, 
a unique and unbelievable phenomenon. It is the onus and concern 
of all men. It subjects everyone to the same way of life, puts every­
one on a level with everyone else, and threatens everyone with 
the same death. Under its sway men have to endure unheard of 
sufferings and fatigue. War is now beyond human endurance in 
noise, movement, enormity of means, and precision of machines; 
and man himself has become merely an object, an object to be 
killed, and prey to a permanent panic that he is unable to translate 
into personal action. Man is subjected by modem war to a nervous 
tension, a psychic pressure, and an animal submission which are 
beyond human power to support. But, involved and committed 
to the machine, he does contrive to support all this, admirable ma­
chine that he isl In the process, however, he is stretched to the 
limit of his resistance, like a steel cable which may break at any 
moment.
The conditions of war may still be abnormal and exceptional. 
Nevertheless, even four or five years of war are significant in the 
life of a man. And the conditions of war eventually become very 
nearly his daily state; for the “abnormal” and the “exceptional,” 
with a somewhat lesser intensity, are reproduced regularly during
The Technological Society ( 3 * 1
the course of each day. Man was made to do his daily work with 
his muscles; but see him now, like a fly on flypaper, seated for 
eight hours, motionless at a desk. Fifteen minutes of exercise can* 
not make up for eight hours of absence. The human being was 
made to breathe the good air of nature, but what he breathes is an 
obscure compound of acids and coal tars. He was created for a 
living environment, but he dwells in a lunar world of stone, cement, 
asphalt, glass, cast iron, and steel. The trees wilt and blanch among 
sterile and blind stone facades. Cats and dogs disappear little by 
little from the city, going the way of the horse. Only rats and men 
remain to populate a dead world. Man was created to have room 
to move about in, to gaze into far distances, to live in rooms which, 
even when they were tiny, opened out on fields. See him now, 
enclosed by the rules and architectural necessities imposed by over­
population in a twelve-by-twelve closet opening out on an anony* 
mous world of city streets.
Every man is in this fix, not merely the proletariat, and nothing 
can be done about it. What was once the abnormal has become 
the usual, standard condition of things. Even so, the human being 
is ill at ease in this strange new environment, and the tension de­
manded of him weighs heavily on his life and being. He seeks to 
flee— and tumbles into the snare of dreams; he tries to comply—  
and falls into the life of organizations; he feels maladjusted— and 
becomes a hypochondriac. But the new technological society has 
foresight and ability enough to anticipate these human reactions. It 
has undertaken, with the help of techniques of every kind, to make 
supportable what was not previously so, and not, indeed, by modi­
fying anything in man’s environment but by taking action upon 
man himself. Psychology is resorted to more and more; everybody 
knows how important morale isl Man can support the harshest and 
most inhumane living conditions, provided his morale holds. In­
numerable psychological examples and experiments confirm this.
In a world where technique demands the utmost of men, this 
maximum cannot be attained, maintained, or surpassed— as some­
times is required— except by a will that is always steady and taut. 
Man does not by nature possess such a will. He is by no means 
naturally prepared for such a sublime condition, and if he some­
times does attain to it naturally, the exaltation endures only a few 
moments. Yet it must be prolonged. Psychological conditions must
3 3  2 )  HUMAN TECHNIQUES
be created to enable the individual to give his utmost to war (or 
peace) and to resist prostration and discouragement in the face of 
the dreadful conditions of life into which technique has forced 
him.
At the beginning of 1914, a short war was predicted; the morale 
of the troops, it was said, could not endure a long one. The same 
prophecy was made in 1941 at the beginning of the all-out bom­
bardment of Germany; human beings, it was said, could not long 
endure such a pounding. In 1917 it was announced that the misery 
attendant on the Russian Revolution would soon bring about the 
collapse of Communism. None of these predictions came true; 
morale, and morale alone, sustained human stability. Depending 
on the side men adhered to, they glorified faith in Hitler, their 
country, Communism. But it was not a question of faith; it was 
really a question of an extremely efficient technique of morale 
building designed to make the insupportable supportable. Between 
the intensive Allied bombardment and the intensive German prop­
aganda, the German propaganda carried the day. The Strategic 
Bombing Service of the Americans was forced to conclude that, 
despite all the bombardments, there was by 1944 no noticeable 
lowering of industrial production and that the German workers 
were working with the same enthusiasm as before.
Conversely, when psychological motivation is lacking, industrial 
production immediately falls. Man is able to endure famine, dis­
comfort, and the most abnormal conditions; he can make in t e n s iv e  
and lasting efforts, provided he is psychologically doped. Our so­
ciety places him in a position in which he is always near the break­
ing point and demands just such effort of him. In order that he not 
break down or lag behind (precisely what technical progress f o r ­
bids), he must be furnished with psychic forces he does not have 
in himself, which therefore must come from elsewhere. This is 
sometimes a very simple matter, as, for example, with the system 
of the “self-arresting” production line. When, through fatigue or 
discontent, one of the workers lags behind the others who have 
finished their operation, the production line comes to a halt and 
the other workers are obliged to pause. According to Friedmann, 
“the lagging worker sees that he is keeping his fellows from earning 
the wages they might earn. He feels guilty toward them, and this 
feeling acts as a psychological stimulant which effectively compels
The Technological Society ( 3 * 3
him to resume the collective tempo in spite of fatigue or discon­
tent" These psychological stimulants are innumerable and are very 
often the spontaneous product of the conditions of life. Ideologies 
are a good example. I am not alluding here to political ideologies, 
but to a whole complex of ideologies of a much more restricted 
kind such as are to be found in the Readers Digest.
Technique, then, brings its own ideology; and every technical 
realization engenders its own ideological justifications. A recent 
study of the Tennessee Valley Authority by Wengert examines this 
phenomenon in detail. The TVA originally was an exclusively tech­
nical program to develop hydraulic power and prevent dangerous 
flooding. The program was carried out and the power generated 
was duly distributed to neighboring localities. It proved to be a 
profitable venture, in spite of what some people may say about it. 
In the beginning the TVA did not have cultural implications. But 
even before the program yielded concrete results, the myth began 
to develop, and today the TVA has become a symbol of regionalism 
in the United States. To it is ascribed the function of co-ordinating 
and integrating diverse activities; a role in the methodical develop­
ment of natural resources; a task of decentralization affecting pub­
lic and private federal and local institutions; and even a mission of 
education. We hear of “democracy on the march" and other such 
panegyrics. But nothing in this myth corresponds to facts; it is a 
set of ideological constructions which do indeed start from con­
crete, technical, and true facts. But these facts in no way imply 
such constructions. Mythical constructions such as these lie in the 
realm of those moral fables for which politicians, economists, and 
sociologists are often responsible. The press and the radio then 
take up these fictions and popularize them; and the public, always 
uneasy about its failure to find solutions to the problems perpetually 
dinned into its ears, falls eagerly upon what seems to be a solution 
and gives it currency.
At such a moment an ideology is born and, in the democratic 
countries, becomes public opinion. After the public has taken it up, 
other technical schemes are elaborated on the basis of the myth. 
Thus, as a function of ideologies in no way implied by the TVA, 
corresponding programs were proposed for the Missouri River. 
But the correspondence is mere appearance.
Not technique but man is responsible for this wholesale manu-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3* 4 )
facture of symbols. Perhaps it is closer to the truth to say that the 
contact between man and technique brings this about, of necessity. 
It is literally impossible for the public to believe that so much ef­
fort and intelligence, so many dazzling results, produce only ma­
terial effects. People simply cannot admit tliat a great dam produces 
nothing but electricity. The myth of the dam in France springs from 
the fact that mass man worships his own massive works and can­
not bring himself to attribute to them a merely material value. 
Moreover, since these works involve immense sacrifices, it is neces­
sary to justify the sacrifices ( a fact I shall return to in my study of 
propaganda). In short, man creates for himself a new religion of a 
rational and technical order to justify his work and to be justified 
in it The mechanism of the TVA affords a remarkable example of 
this process.
It is thus possible through psychological means to draw from man 
his last measure of effort and at the same time compel him to bear 
up under the disadvantages with which the new society hinders 
him. This is the first goal of psychological techniques. The only 
thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of 
technique; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization 
of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation 
of all human psychic forces.
After these reflections, we cannot accept the often quoted state­
ment: "The effort to increase production must cease when the 
equilibrium of the whole man is endangered.” This statement 
would be acceptable if equilibrium were stable or static. But what 
does equilibrium mean when it is possible to re-create it more or 
less arbitrarily by purely artificial means? What can limits mean 
when psychological devices make it possible to push back all limits? 
A fixed structure no longer exists for man. We exact of him what 
he would never yield of himself. The machine allows him to com­
ply with the material demands made upon him and psychological 
manipulation permits it spiritually. The modification of the human 
psyche that results from the interrelation of all techniques makes 
nonsense of the statement quoted. The equilibrium of the whole 
man? The technical society is capable of re-creating man as a very 
different whole from what he was a century ago. It is able to re­
establish “equilibrium” at a higher or lower point ( according to the
The Technological Society (3 2 5
criteria employed); but, in any case, to establish it at a different 
level from the one maintained before the technical era.
Modification of the Milieu and Space. Technique has penetrated 
the deepest recesses of the human being. The machine tends not 
only to create a new human environment, but also to modify man’s 
very essence. The milieu in which he lives is no longer his. He 
must adapt himself, as though the world were new, to a universe 
for which he was not created. He was made to go six kilometers an 
hour, and he goes a thousand. He was made to eat when he was 
hungry and to sleep when he was sleepy; instead, he obeys a clock. 
He was made to have contact with living things, and he lives in a 
world of stone. He was created with a certain essential unity, and 
he is fragmented by all the forces of themodern world.
Admittedly, the machine has enriched man as it has changed 
him. The machine’s senses and organs have multiplied the powers 
of human senses and organs, enabling man to penetrate a new 
milieu and revealing to him unknown sights, liberties, and servi­
tudes. He has been liberated little by little from physical con­
straints, but he is all the more the slave of abstract ones. He acts 
through intermediaries and consequently has lost contact with 
reality. The interested reader may wish to consult Friedmann's 
admirable work concerning the separation of the worker from his 
material. Man as worker has lost contact with the primary element 
of life and environment, the basic material out of which he makes 
what he makes. He no longer knows wood or iron or wool. He is 
acquainted only with the machine. His capacity to become a me­
chanic has replaced his knowledge of his material; this develop­
ment has occasioned profound mental and psychic transformations 
which cannot yet be assessed.
Men with scientific knowledge of materials are found only in 
research institutes. But they never use these materials or see them 
and have merely an abstract knowledge of their properties. The 
men who actually use the materials to produce a finished product 
no longer know them. They follow engineering specifications, using 
the only object they will ever know firsthand: the machine. Even 
so, it cannot be said that man is adapted to the machine. The pilot 
of the supersonic aircraft at its maximum velocity becomes, in a 
sense, completely one with his machine. But immobilized in a net-
3 2 6 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
work of tubes and ducts, he is deaf, blind, and impotent. His senses 
have been replaced by dials which inform him what is taking place. 
Built into his helmet, for example, is an electroencephalographic 
apparatus which can warn him of an imminent rarefaction of oxy­
gen before his senses could have told him. We can say he “subsists” 
in abnormal conditions; but we cannot say he is adapted to them 
in any really human sense. And his situation is not exceptional.
It is not only in work (which takes up a great part of his life) 
that man encounters this transformation. His environment as a 
whole— everything that goes to make up his milieu, his livelihood, 
habitat, and habits— is modified. The machine has transformed 
whatever is most immediately connected with him: home, furni­
ture, food. His dwelling place becomes more and more mecha­
nized, like a factory, through an extreme division of labor and the 
organization of housework. Catherine Esther Beecher’s1  analysis 
of the domestic function caused many people to feel sympathetic 
in some degree toward the systematization of housework in the 
nineteenth century, even though it seemed strange at first. Since 
the thirties, however, the systematic organization of kitchen space 
has been completely accepted, with its three "centers” of work (for 
preparation, cooking, and washing), along with the “taylorization” 
of the motions of cooking. Technical rigor has penetrated into the 
domain of the unco-ordinated, the unconsidered, the individual, 
and has resulted in the avoidance of motion, steps, time, and 
fatigue. It has also put the housewife into a laboratory, into a 
minutely ordered network of relentless motions representing slav­
ery a thousandfold more exacting than anything she knew in the 
past. It is useless to insist on this point. France is on the threshold 
of this transformation; it is already far advanced in the United 
States. Even the most superficial observers can see that this trans­
formation of housework by the machine has brought about a com­
pletely different style of living. Wife and children no longer fulfill 
their traditional function. A new relation exists between husband 
and wife and between parent and child. The “hearth” no longer 
has any meaning, and the patient building of family relations no 
raison d’etre. A different state of mind necessarily corresponds to
1  M iss Beecher (1800-78) wrote extensively on education for wom en. She held that 
wom an's domestic function was paramount and for this reason opposed female 
suffrage. (Trans.)
The Technological Society (3 *7
a radically different state of affairs. But what state of mind? As yet, 
no one seems to know. One’s first reaction is simply to say: "No 
state of mind.”
The machine is modifying household furnishings to an ever 
greater degree. The interested reader is referred to Siegfried 
Giedion’s work, which describes not only this modification of 
household furniture but also the modification of the whole struc­
ture of housing. Giedion’s conclusion is that mechanization is "tyr­
annizing over housing.” Furniture and housing must of course 
comply with the necessities of mass production. Both must undergo 
modification because of the mechanization of household interiors; 
a house must be conceived less for the comfort of its occupants 
than for the accommodation of the numerous mechanical gadgets 
to be installed in it.
In a different area of private life, there is the wide range of ef­
fects mechanization has had upon food, for example, through the 
various new methods of preservation and storage. I. have already 
mentioned the profound modification of bread, which has become 
a chemical substance of very different composition from that pro­
duced from simple cereal grains.. Beginning with Sylvester Gra­
ham’s Treatise on Bread, a number of studies have shown to what 
degree the organic structure of bread has been modified by the 
machine and by the science of chemistry. The result was a pro­
found modification of taste, as if “the consumers, by an unconscious 
reaction, adapted their taste to the type of bread which corre­
sponded exactly to the demands of mass production.” Mechaniza­
tion shattered the age-old character of bread and con verted it into a 
valueless article of fashion. This statement is not an aesthetic judg­
ment or a lingering romanticism, but rather the result of exact tech­
nical studies, a technical fact established by technicians; this in it­
self presupposes it is not a value judgment. We are registering a fact 
and not nostalgia for the old whole-wheat bread of our ancestors. 
It is a fact of the same order as the retreat of wine before Coca- 
Cola; the ancient “civilization of wine” is becoming obsolescent as 
a result of an industrial product
Just as material surroundings— the nearest, humblest, and most 
personal— have been modified, so have the broader and more ab­
stract elements of life. Work, rest, and food, and time, space, and 
movement as well, no longer have any connection with traditional
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 *8 )
forms. It is commonly said that with the new modes of transport 
distance no longer exists; and, indeed, man has vanquished space. 
He is able to travel about the entire globe. He meets men of other 
races. He becomes a cosmopolite and a citizen of the world, less, 
it may be added, through his own will and ideals than through the 
mechanical fact of easy transport.
But only a small minority of people use airlines, enter into rela­
tions with the world, and see space stretch out before them. For 
the overwhelming majority, although space has not remained tra­
ditional, it has undergone an inverse evolution. The world’s popula­
tion has increased tenfold in a very short time. In particular, the 
population of France has almost trebled in a century and a half, 
so that we have, in effect, only one third the amount of room per 
capita that we formerly had. No longer are there any lonely moun­
tains and deserted seacoasts. Solitude is no longer possible; space 
is at such a premium that men jostle one another everywhere. Quite 
apart from the solitude of relaxation, we no longer have even the 
normal solitude which implies sufficient space to live other than as 
if in a prison cell or at a factory workbench. Living and working 
traditionally meant open space, a no man’s land separating a man 
from his fellows. But there is no longer any possibility of that.
Man has always known wide horizons. Even the city dweller had 
direct contact with limitless plains, mountains, and seas. Beyond 
the enclosing walls of the medieval city, was open country. At most 
the citizen had to walk five hundred yards to reach the city walls, 
where space, fair and free, suddenly extended before him. Today 
man knows only bounded horizons and reduced dimensions. The 
space not only of his movements but of his gaze is shrinking. The 
paradox is characteristic of our times, that to the abstract conquest 
of Space by Man (capitalized) corresponds the limitation of place 
for men (in small letters). It is scarcely necessary to emphasize 
the fact that this diminution of Lebensraum results indirectly from 
techniques (through population growth) or directly from them 
(through urban and industrial agglomeration).
Modification of Time and Motion. In much the same way tech­
nique has modified human time. That man until recently got along 
well enough without measuring time precisely is something we 
never even think about, and that we do not think about it shows 
to what a degree we have been affected by technique. What means
TheTechnological Society ( 329
there were in the past for measuring time belonged to the rich and, 
until the fourteenth century, exerted no influence on real time or 
on life. Until then, there were mechanical horologia which did not 
so much mark the hour as indicate it very approximately by bells 
or chimes. The clocktower, with its public clock, made its appear­
ance toward the end of the century. Until then, time had been 
measured by life’s needs and events. At most, life had been regu­
lated since the fifth century by church bells; but this regulation 
really followed a psychological and biological tempo. The time 
man guided himself by corresponded to nature’s time; it was ma­
terial and concrete. It became abstract (probably toward the end 
of the fourteenth century) when it was divided into hours, minutes, 
and seconds. Little by little this mechanical kind of time, with its 
knife-edge divisions, penetrated, along with machinery, into hu­
man life. The first private clocks appeared in the sixteenth century. 
Thenceforward, time was an abstract measure separated from the 
traditional rhythms of life and nature. It became mere quantity. 
But since life is inseparable from time, life too was forced to submit 
to the new guiding principle. From then on, life itself was measured 
by the machine; its organic functions obeyed the mechanical. Eat­
ing, working, and sleeping were at the beck and call of machinery. 
Time, which had been the measure of organic sequences, was 
broken and dissociated. Human life ceased to be an ensemble, a 
whole, and became a disconnected set of activities having no other 
bond than the fact that they were performed by the same indi­
vidual.1  Mechanical abstraction and rigidity permeated the whole 
structure of being. “Abstract time became a new milieu, a new 
framework of existence.” Today the human being is dissociated 
from the essence of life; instead of living time, he is split up and 
parceled out by it. Lewis Mumford is right in calling the dock 
the most important machine of our culture. And he is right too in 
asserting that the clock has made modern progress and efficiency 
possible through its rapidity of action and the co-ordination it ef-
* Enrico Castelli'i study Le Temps harcelant extends our observations in to  the realm 
of the psychological. He show s how the m an of the technical world lives without 
past or future and how the loss of the sense of duration deprives law and language 
of their m eaning. According to Castelli, m odern m an lives in a universe in  which 
technique has divested language of its m eaning and value. If this formula seem s 
exaggerated, I would direct you to Castelli’s book, to see its essential truth.
The book stresses the fact that technique, as a result of the perfection of meats 
which it has placed at the disposal of m odern m an, has effectively suppressed the
HUMAN TECHNIQUES330 )
fects in man’s daily activities. All organization of work and study of 
motion is based on the clock.
There is a third general, nonmaterial element of human life 
which, along with space and time, has been profoundly modified 
by technique: motion. Here, too, we observe the same process. 
Motion is the spontaneous expression of life, its visible form. Every­
thing alive chooses of itself its attitudes, orientations, gestures, and 
rhythms. There is, perhaps, nothing more personal to a living being 
— as far as the observer is concerned— than its movements. In 
reality there is no such thing as movement in general; there are 
only the movements of individual things.
Technique, however, considers the matter very differently. Gil- 
breth’s ingenuity consisted in analyzing the notions of an indi­
vidual and thus rendering them abstract. There was no longer a 
being in motion, but a point; not a series of acts, but a curve, a 
trajectory in abstract space and time. It is true that human activi­
ties bear certain resemblances to one another, and by synthesizing 
them it is possible to arrive at precise laws of their motion. More­
over, every human skill in action is based upon a complex of funda­
mental principles common to all. It is therefore possible to specify 
not only the laws which govern them but also their exact trajec 
tories. This supposes, first, the abstraction of motion, and second, 
its analysis. Motion is dissected into discrete aspects so that its 
form appears phenomenally, point by point. The immediate conse­
quence of such analysis is that motion becomes completely dis­
joined from personal and internal life. Technical analysis concen­
trates on the efficient cause of human actions and eliminates as 
secondary everything that expresses human personality. Action is 
no longer a real function of the person who performs it; it is a 
function of abstract and ideal symbols, which become its sole 
criteria.
As long as we restrict ourselves to scientific investigation, such at-
respite of time indispensable to the rhythm of life; between desire and the satis­
faction of desire there is no longer the duration which is necessary for real choice 
and exam ination. There is no longer respite for reflecting or choosing or adapting 
oneself, or for acting or wishing or pulling oneself together. The rule of life is: No 
sooner said than done. Life has become a racecourse com posed of instantaneous 
variations of the universe, a succession of objective events which drag us along and 
lead us astray without anywhere affording us the possibility of standing apart, 
taking stock, and ceasing to act
The Technological Society ( 3 31
tempts to analyze motion are completely acceptable. But as far as 
concrete reality is concerned, they must be judged futile. However, 
these analyses Soon showed their compelling power, and were ap­
plied to an everincreasing degree to the modification of the worker’s 
practical motions. The problem of the regulation of these move­
ments in industry is so well known that I need not refer to it here. 
But this type of regulation is gaining ground outside the sphere of 
manual labor. All the machines of our technological society pre­
suppose to an ever greater degree the perfect motions Gilbreth 
defined in his trajectories. The more rapidly our machines operate, 
the more precise they must be, and the less we can allow ourselves 
the luxury of using them arbitrarily. This is as true of the machines 
we have in our houses as of the machines we meet on the street. 
Our movements must approach perfection to the degree that the 
machines approach it and continue to increase in number. Our mo­
tions are no longer entitled to express our own personalities. It 
suffices to take one look at distracted and panicky elderly people 
in the middle of a Paris street to understand that modern velocities 
render motion abstract and no longer tolerate imperfect motions 
just because they are human.
We still do not know the ultimate effects of these transforma­
tions on the human being. We have only begun to study them. 
Precisely what is modified in man by this violent upheaval of 
every element of his environment? We do not know. But we do 
know that violent modifications have taken place, and we have a 
foreboding of them in the development of neuroses and in the new 
behaviors with which contemporary literature acquaints us. In 
ceasing to be himself, modem man bears testimony to these phe­
nomena not only when he suffers anxiety but even when he is 
happy. For the last decade scientific studies have been accumulat­
ing which demonstrate man’s psychological, moral, and even bio­
logical incapacity to adapt in any real way to the milieu technique 
has created for him. Careful studies have analyzed the nervous 
afflictions brought on by industrial work; but contact with other 
kinds of machines (for example, automobiles, television) or the 
life of the technician in general apparently produce the same ef­
fects. The November i960 issue of Semaines mSdicales de Vans, 
on the basis of information contributed by 4,000 physicians all over 
the world, offers a study of a new disease of great complexity which
332 )  HUM AN TECHNIQUES
is brought on by modem city life and which might be called urban-
itis.
Some investigators have already become engrossed in the ques­
tion of a better adaptation of man to his new milieu. For example, 
they are concerned with the necessity of giving man the means of 
“assimilating the machine,” or of assimilating its lessons, of causing 
it to become a part of human life. It is generally agreed that with­
out such assimilation it is impossible to transcend the machine or 
to arrive at a new form of society. This assimilation is the prime 
objective of the so-called human sciences, the sciences which have 
man as their subject.
Furthermore, it is necessary to protect man by outfitting him 
with a kind of psychological shock absorber. Only another tech­
nique is able to give efficient protection against the aggression of 
techniques. This protection is the second objective of the human
sciences.
We shall examine later on whether it is reasonable to hope to 
create a genuinely human civilization by transcending the ma­
chine with the aid of the human sciences. At this point let us 
remark merely that it is precisely the need to diagnose and cure 
this disease that is offered as both justification and demand for the 
creation of new human techniques.
The Creation of the Mass Society. There is a third area in which 
human techniques are applied, and it represents a further cause of 
disequilibration for the human being seeking to adapt to his new 
milieu.
It is a truism to state that contemporary society is becoming a 
mass society. The “process of massification,” “the accession of the 
masses” have been thoroughly studied and understood. Less well 
understood, however, is the fact that the man of the present is not 
spontaneously adapted to the new form of society. Previous socie­
ties took their character to a very large degree from the men in 
them. Technical or economic conditions imposed certain sociologi­
cal structures, but the human being was in essential agreement with 
these structures, and the form society took expressed the psy­
chology of the individual. This is no longer true. The process of 
massification takes place not because the man of today is by 
nature a mass man, but for technical reasons. Man becomes a mass 
man in the new framework imposed upon him because he is unable
The Technological Society (333
to remain for very long at variance with his milieu. The adaptation 
of men to a mass society is not yet an accomplished fact; and recent 
research in the field of psychoanalytic sociology has revealed the 
gap which still exists between man and the collective society, a 
gap which is the cause of disequilibration. Every society has norms 
which represent a criterion of the normal. When these norms 
change their character, a disturbance of equilibrium ensues and, 
for the man who has not kept pace with the changes, neurosis. 
There is no doubt that the norms of our civilization have changed 
for reasons which are not “human”; men as a whole had no desire 
for the changes that occurred nor did they work toward them con­
sciously. Indirect influences have operated on the norms of modem 
society, and these norms have been transformed without men 
knowing what was happening.
It seems to me that Karen Homey’s analysis of this disequilibra­
tion is accurate. According to Homey, our civilization (or so men 
believe) still attests to a secularized Christian ideology which sets 
the highest value on brotherly relations. But the structures of our 
world and its real norms represent diametrically the opposite. The 
fundamental rule of the world today is the rule of economic, 
political, and class competition— and this competition extends to 
the social and human relations of friendship and sex. The dis­
equilibration between the traditional affirmation and the new cri­
terion has produced the climate of anxiety and insecurity charac­
teristic of our epoch and of our neuroses, and corresponds exactly 
to the distinction between the individualist society and the mass 
society.
The human being does not feel at home in the collective at­
mosphere. This is true of societies that differ in many ways among 
themselves; it applies to the primitive sociological collectivism of 
Africa, to the individualistic civilization of Europe, and to the col­
lective adaptation of a higher type in the United States. In all these 
societies everyone is affected by a certain malaise. The change of 
sociological structures is occurring at a very rapid tempo and af­
fects everyone; and the state demands an immediate collective 
effort from all the citizens. A sufficient respite is never afforded the 
individual to allow him to assimilate all the new criteria.
The process of classification corresponds, moreover, to the dis­
appearance of anything resembling a community. The majority of
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 3 4 )
American psychosociologists insist on the importance of human 
social relations for the individual. As Jerome Scott and R. P. 
Lynton put it: “Every man requires emotional and intellectual 
satisfactions which alone secure for him his belonging to a com­
munity.” When this need is suppressed, neuroses result Some ex­
perts even maintain that most obsessive neurosis springs from a 
failure of social adaptation and from the suppression of community 
relations, for which technical relations are substituted, as Roeth- 
lisbergerhas pointed out.
This new sociological mass structure and its new criteria of 
civilization seem both inevitable and undeniable. They are inevita­
ble because they are imposed by technical forces and economic 
considerations beyond the reach of man. They are not the result of 
thought, doctrine, discourse, will. They are simply there as a con­
dition of fact All social reforms, all social changes, are located 
wholly within this condition of fact, unless they are purely utopian. 
When social change is truly realistic, it accepts this condition buoy­
antly, vindicates it, and exploits it. Only two possibilities are left 
to tbe individual: either he remains what he was, in which case he 
becomes more and more unadapted, neurotic, and inefficient, loses 
his possibilities of subsistence, and is at last tossed on the social 
rubbish heap, whatever his talents may be; or he adapts himself to 
the new sociological organism, which becomes his world, and he 
becomes unable to live except in a mass society. (And then he 
scarcely differs from a cave man.) But to become a mass man en­
tails a tremendous effort of psychic mutation. The purpose of the 
techniques which have man as their object, the so-called human 
techniques, is to assist him in this mutation, to help him find the 
quickest way. to calm his fears, and reshape his heart and his brain.
When we look into technical rather than theoretical works on 
this subject, the design emerges with great clarity. “It is a question 
of strengthening the environment in such a way that, in practice, 
all subjects come more or less quickly under its influence,” says 
Claude Munson, from a pragmatic American point of view. If inte­
gration proves impossible, it is then necessary to uproot the indi­
vidual from one social environment and place him in another where 
adaptation is possible. Somehow provision must be made for the 
individual to reach the glorious state of equilibrium so desired by 
those who guide human destiny— the state in which the individual
The Technological Society (335
is so adapted that his personal difficulties are no different from 
those of the collectivity. He is no longer a man in a group, but an 
element of the group.
It is remarkable that mass participation distracts the individual 
from his miseries and even dispels them. After all, the process of 
massification was itself the origin of man’s psychic difficulties!
Another aspect of this adaptation is the adjustment of the in­
dividual to technical instruments. The instruments in our posses­
sion are, in effect, mass instruments, both in the realm of material 
action and in that of psychological action. If at present we desire to 
exert any influence on man, it is possible to do so only through the 
mass media and only to the degree that man is a mass man. I shall 
return to this fact with reference to mass education and to propa­
ganda methods, both of which are able to move the mass individual 
only by “massifying” him more and more.
The nonspontaneous union of the individual and the collectivity 
is one of the essential conditions for the development of techniques 
in the special sociological form they take in our society. This union 
is, as we shall see, one of the most noteworthy results of the tech­
niques devoted to man. In this connection it is an oversimplifica­
tion to speak of “collectivization’’ or "human guidance.” This com­
plete mutation of the human species has not been produced by a 
collectivist theory or by someone’s will to power. The cause is 
much more profound, at once human and inhuman; inhuman be­
cause it is occasioned by things and circumstances, human because 
it answers the heart’s desire of every modem man, without excep­
tion.
We have studied the threefold foundation of the indispensable 
human techniques: the superhuman demands made on man by 
present-day society, the complete modification of the human en­
vironment, and the alteration of sociological structures. Man, in 
fundamental disaccord with his universe, must of necessity be 
restored to harmony with it.
Human Techniques. It thus became imperative to rethink the 
whole situation of man in his new world. But thinking things 
through seemed altogether insufficient; it was necessary to act Ac­
tion upon the techniques themselves appeared to be impossible. 
The question therefore became: Is it not possible to act upon man 
himself? To help him resist? To protect him, perhaps; to educate
3 3*>) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
him, certainly? The applications of the human sciences were 
worked out along these lines of thought.
In our day human techniques offer great hopes to man, sorely 
beset by anxiety. Not long ago an extensive survey of the different 
scientific disciplines appeared under the title: The Sciences of 
Man Re-establish His Supremacy. Man, menaced by his own dis­
coveries and no longer capable of mastering the forces unleashed 
by them, is to have his greatness restored by human techniques. 
The grounds for hope given in the survey by Georges Fried­
mann, Alain Sargent, Jean Fourastie, Georges Weill, Chombart de 
Lowe, J. Gueron, and others are reducible to three elements:
First, the liberation of man, not by technique in general, but spe­
cifically through the agency of human techniques, a liberation 
which proceeds as much from within man as from without. With 
the help of the human sciences, man will be freed from technocracy 
itself. Technique will combat slavery. According to Chombart de 
Lowe, research in this area must be completely disinterested and 
free from any preoccupation with immediate application. Tech­
niques are in a position to offer man a saner and more balanced 
life and to free him from material constraints, whether these arise 
from nature or from the actions of other men. The human being 
is freer when he is no longer in danger of famine and when he has 
some leisure from labor. Technique is in great part the basis of 
this freedom. In addition, the human techniques purify and free 
the inner man; this, for example, is the grand design of psycho­
analysis. Man, freed and returned to himself, will be much better 
adapted to life and to the mastery of the difficulties with which the 
modem world confronts him.
The second element is less hackneyed: the world of techniques 
is no longer the abstract and mechanical world imagined by its 
critics and by the technocrats themselves. We have known for some 
time that technique is of little value if it has not been rendered 
tractable by man. Humanism, then, has been restored to its place 
of honor; to act contrary to the profundities of human nature is to 
act irrationally. This represents, for the most part, a merely verbal 
and ideological humanism. There may have been some genuinely 
humanistic aspects in modem discoveries, but for the most part 
they have been primarily technical. A good method applied by an 
imbecile does not yield good results; and a technique used by a
The Technological Society (3 3 7
man full of rancor, disgust, or resentment, or by a man who detests 
it, will not be very efficient. Research therefore has taken two di­
rections. It has concerned itself with making the interests of man 
and technique correspond, thus rendering technique flexible. It 
has also attempted to take human nature into account in order to 
keep man from being crushed by technique, thereby becoming an 
obstacle to technique. On both these counts there has been an un­
ceasing effort to refine our knowledge of human techniques in order 
to bridge the gap between man and technique. The claims of the 
human being have thus come to assert themselves to a greater and 
greater degree in the development of techniques; this is known as 
“humanizing the techniques.” Man is not supposed to be merely a 
technical object, but a participant in a complicated movement. 
His fatigue, pleasures, nerves, and opinions are carefully taken into 
account Attention is paid to his reactions to orders, his phobias, 
and his earnings. A ll this fills the uneasy With hope. From the mo­
ment man is taken seriously, it seems to them that they are wit­
nessing the creation of a technical humanism.
The third element of hope is the fact that these human tech­
niques have tended to reconstitute the unity of the human being 
which had been shattered by the sudden and jarring action of 
technique. The grand design of human techniques is to make man 
the center of all techniques. He has been torn in every direction 
by the technical forces of the modem world and is no longer able 
of himself, at least on an individual level, to preserve his unity. 
But this lost unity can be restored by technique on the abstract 
level of science. There is no doubt that technique can counter tech­
nique; and abstractly man can thereby be restored to unity. A 
group of techniques is to be formed, therefore, centered on a con­
cept of man and activated by the human techniques.
There is a fourth glorious element: the prospect of the creation 
of a “superman.” He will not appear tomorrow. But serious biolo­
gists already speak of the possibilities of chemical conditioning in 
the near future, and, more distantly, of parthenogenesis and ecto- 
genesis, and embryonic conditioning. It is useless to dwell on these 
theories here; they are only remote possibilities. However, it is 
instructive to see how many intellectuals hope to find in the crea­
tion of superman the solution of all the otherwise insoluble prob­
lems posed to the common man by the technical world in which
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 3 8)
he lives. Of course the superman I speak of has nothing to do with 
Superman, the American comic-strip character. Man’s power is not 
the issue here, but his intellectual and psychic life, to say nothing 
of his spiritual life.
It would be idle to deny all reality to such hopes. To a great 
degree these auguries are justified. Technical knowledge does give 
us new insights into human reality and can serve toward its unifi­
cation.
Among the elements I have summarized, the most important is 
undoubtedly the second. The concrete details of man’s life with 
respect to technical apparatus must be taken into consideration on 
the human plane. The fatigue factor is important; and the indi­
vidual’s labor must be planned to reduce fatigue. It is essential in 
constructing machinery to avoid uncomfortable or dangerous situa­
tions for the operator, and to modify the wage earner’s milieu to 
give him more pleasure, light, and the freedom and fellow feeling 
indispensable to him. It is desirable to show concern for the 
worker’s dwelling place, for the comfort of the housewife’s kitchen, 
for the lighting of the children’s rooms; in short, for any factor 
that will obviously be of advantage to all. Who could believe the 
contrary or plead for slums or worker casualties?
However, a certain misunderstanding must be avoided. The 
word humanism is often spoken in connection with the situation I 
have described. Humanism is essentially a certain conception of 
man. And, it develops, this is an astonishing conception of man, a 
conception that involves contempt for man’s inner life to the ad­
vantage of his sociological life, contempt of his moral and intel­
lectual life to the advantage of his material life. This position is 
admissible for conscious materialists; but I cannot admit it for the 
unconscious materialists who are always prating of their spiritu­
ality. The argument that moral development will follow material 
development can only be characterized as hypocrisy. Moreover, 
it has not always been a voluntary and conscious humanism which 
has presided over this progress. If we seek the real reason, we hear 
over and over again that there is "something out of line” in the 
technical system, an insupportable state of affairs for a technician. 
A remedy must be found. What is out of line? According to the 
usual superficial analysis, it is man that is amiss. The technician
TheT echnological Society (3 3 9
thereupon tackles the problem as he would any other. He has a 
method which has hitherto enabled him to solve all difficulties, and 
he uses it here too. But he considers man only as an object of 
technique and only to the degree that man interferes with the 
proper function of the technique. Technique reveals its essential 
efficiency in discerning that man has a sentimental and moral life 
which can have great influence on his material behavior and in pro­
posing to do something about such factors on the basis of its own 
ends. These factors are, for technique, human and subjective; but 
if means can be found to act upon them, to rationalize them and 
bring them into line, they need not be a technical drawback. Of 
course, man as such does not count.
When the technical problem is well in hand, the professional 
humanists look at the situation and dub it “humanist.” This pro­
cedure suits the literati, moralists, and philosophers who are con­
cerned about the human situation. What is more natural than for 
philosophers to say: "See how we are concerned with Man?”; and 
for their literary admirers to echo: “At last, a humanism which is 
not confined to playing with ideas but which penetrates the facts!” 
Unfortunately, it is a historical fact that this shouting of humanism 
always comes after the technicians have intervened; for a true 
humanism, it ought to have occurred before. This is nothing more 
than the traditional psychological maneuver called rationalizing.
Since 1947 we have witnessed the same humanist rationalizing 
with respect to the earth itself. In the United States, for example, 
methods of large-scale agriculture had been savagely applied. The 
humanists became alarmed by this violation of the sacred soil, 
this lack of respect for nature; but the technical people troubled 
themselves not at all until a steady decline in agricultural pro­
ductivity became apparent Technical research discovered that the 
earth contains certain trace elements which become exhausted 
when the soil is mistreated. This discovery, made by Sir Albert 
Howard in his thorough investigation of Indian agriculture, led to 
the conclusion that animal and vegetable (“organic” ) fertilizers 
were superior to any and all artificial fertilizers, and that it is es­
sential not to exhaust the earth's reserves. Up to now no one has 
succeeded in finding a way of replacing trace elements artificially. 
The technicians have recommended more care in the use of fer­
tilizers and moderation in die utilization of machinery; in short.
HUMAN TECHNIQUES340)
“respect” for the soil. And all nature lovers rejoice. But was any 
real respect for the earth involved here? Clearly not. The impor­
tant thing was agricultural yield.
It might be objected: “Who cares what the real causes were if 
the result is respect for man or for nature? If technical excess 
brings us to wisdom, let us by all means develop techniques. If 
man must be effectively protected by a technique that understands 
him, we may at least rest assured that he will be better protected 
than he ever was by all his philosophies.” This is hocus-pocus. To­
day’s technique may respect man because it is in its interest and 
part of its normal course of development to do so. But we have 
no certainty that this will be so in the future. We could have a 
measure of certainty only if technique, by necessity and for deep 
and lasting reasons, subordinated its power in principle to the in­
terests of man Otherwise, a complete reversal is always possible. 
Tomorrow it might be in technique’s interest to exploit man bru­
tally, to mutilate and suppress him. We have, as of now, no guaran­
tee whatsoever that this is not the road it will take. On the contrary, 
we see all around us at least as many signs of increasing contempt 
for man as of respect for him. Technique mixes the one with the 
other indiscriminately. The only law it follows is that of its own 
autonomous development. To me, therefore, it seems impossible 
to speak of a technical humanism.
Review
Bight at the beginning, let us emphasize that we are studying 
technique.
It was thought for a long time that man’s conduct belonged to 
the realm of art, and it can certainly be said that Freudian psy­
choanalysis is an art. Behavior based on flair, on intuitive as well 
as reasoned knowledge, and on personal relations; the spontaneous 
devising of means for influencing heart and mind; the whole­
hearted participation of man in his acts— all these are characteristic 
of art. Great leaders, great teachers, and agitators have all been 
artists. But art and artistry no longer suffice. We must find solu­
tions to the problems raised by techniques, and only through 
technical means can we find them.
The Technological Society (341
The means of exerting action on men must answer to the fol­
lowing three criteria: (1) Generality. Every man must be reached 
in every area of life because everyone is involved. Individual ac­
tion is unimportant, (a) Objectivity. Action, since it is a function 
of society itself, cannot be dependent upon the transient and sub­
jective acts of individuals. The means must be rendered independ­
ent of the individual who employs them so as to make them ap­
plicable by anyone at all. This criterion alone would imply the 
transition from art to technique. (3) Permanence. Since the techni­
cal challenge to man concerns his whole life, psychic action must 
be exerted upon him without letup, from the beginning of his 
existence to its end.
Localized intervention by the great or powerful can no longer be 
relied upon. And action by fits and starts is not enough; it must be 
steady and uniform. Because the transition to practical application 
must be effected quickly, it is scarcely possible to speak of science. 
The problem is to discover the most effective means; one is there­
fore obliged to call the whole complex technique, in spite of the 
lofty tone taken by people who put their faith in the “human 
sciences.” When Serge Tchakhotin writes, with reference to prop­
aganda, that “the understanding of the mechanisms of human 
behavior entails the possibility of managing them at will” . . . and 
that “calculation, prediction, and action according to verifiable 
laws are possible,” he is describing human techniques accurately.
Three facts demonstrate the reality of the transition of action 
from art to technique. The first is the state of mind common to the 
technicians who make use of human techniques. They arbitrarily 
select only those scientific data which seem useful and are disdain­
fully condescending toward whatever data are not utilizable. In 
psychology and psychoanalysis, for example, vocational counselors 
dnd propagandists make a definite choice. In the field of practical 
psychology known as "public relations” (as practiced by, say, Dale 
Carnegie or Claude Munson), a certain suspicion of theoretical and 
abstract psychology prevails; and certain indispensable simplifica­
tions are made. Munson writes that “the mechanism of morale 
building is neither simpler nor less technical than a problem in 
mechanics. Both require a clear conception of the objective, the 
elaboration of a plan of methodical execution, the knowledge of 
all the co-operating factors, a central agent entrusted with the direc-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES34 * )
tion and verification of the operations, a thorough study of meth­
ods, and so on.” Munson, moreover, calls attention to “a remark­
able unpredictability” for which every technician must make al­
lowance. He writes: “Without being able to point out in advance 
the solution for a particular case, one at least knows that the solu­
tion will fit into a determinate type to which certain general prin­
ciples are applicable.” Munson has in mind a program of all the 
different forms of deliberate persuasion, a program with technical 
precision and flexibility.
A second characteristic of the transition from art to technique is 
the extensive application of mathematics. Biometry, psychometry, 
sociometry, and cybernetics have become the chief intermediaries 
for creating these techniques. It is considered illusory to think it 
possible to construct a true system of action from nonquantitative 
laws and observations. This was the traditional stumbling block for 
psychological techniques. When the attempt was first made to 
create a true technique of propaganda, for example, biology, an 
exact science, was taken as the basis. Subsequently, other exact 
disciplines were called upon; for example, public opinion polls and 
statistics. Progress in this and other human techniques came about 
only when the human sciences took on the exactitude of mathe­
matics. Only metric methods can analyze and predict efficiently. 
It is striking to note, incidentally, that metric methods applied in 
different kinds of political regimes by different kinds of technicians 
come to the same result. This too is characteristic of techniques. 
In this respect, I find a remark made by Paul H. Maucorps very 
much to the point. Speaking of American sociometry, Maucorps 
says: “It is interesting to observe that this sociometry has the same 
practical conclusions as the so-called Stakhanovism.” Rubinstein 
makes the same observation from the Soviet point of view.
The third characteristic element in the transition from art to 
technique is the appearance of the technical-experimental state of 
mind. It is admittedly difficult to test human techniques experi­
mentally. This is so for two reasons. These techniques cannot be 
manipulated freely by the experimenter. Moreover, human society 
forms a complicated whole, so that it is very difficult to achieve 
the two conditions necessary for technical experimentation, isola­
tion of phenomena and analysis of elements.
However, without having recourse to the dangerous and over-
The Technological Society (343
hasty methods of totalitarian states, experimenters in the field of 
human techniques have found a particularly good experimental 
field: the army. The army is a singularly favorable environment be­
cause the soldier is away from his customary framework. His social 
ties have been severed, and he has been divested of his traditional 
personality. He then forms completely new social ties; the resultant 
collectivity can be studied from its inception, and isolated from 
secondary and complicating influences. Such a collectivity, more­
over, lends itself to study and is easily observed from day to day. 
The personality of each man is completely new, for with the new 
uniform he assumes a new psychology.
The experiments on the army serve a twofold purpose. First, the 
recruits are directly influenced in their actions and carry this in­
fluence back into civilian life, where their behavior will be predict­
able and they themselves will be easily manipulated. The civilian 
population, therefore, can be influenced through the intermediacy 
of the army, which is connected with the rest of society by links 
that are being drawn tighter and tighter. Second, the knowledge 
gained through experimentation on soldiers has indirect import­
ance. This knowledge can be applied to other, more complex mi­
lieus which might not lend themselves readily to experimentation, 
even though they are similar to the army in kind. Examples which 
come to mind are business organizations and, particularly, great 
industrial plants. Methods found effective in the army are applied 
to the plant; and in the process there is an inevitable tendency to 
simplify human relations and to model after the military the indus­
trial collectives in which these techniques are applied. This in­
direct action is only slowly being felt; but the massive displacement 
of workers, which is constantly increasing even in liberal coun­
tries, shows that, involuntarily, technique in the form of human 
techniques is gradually gaining the upper hand.
Human techniques are of such multiplicity that any attempt to 
describe them adequately would require a whole library. Even an 
attempt to enumerate them would entail the loss of a cohesiveness 
and compactness. There are techniques addressed to man as an 
isolated individual and techniques addressed to man as a social 
being. Some concern his mind and some his body; others touch his 
will; still others that secret place where matter becomes spirit and 
soul animates matter. Techniques are addressed to the child and
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 4 4 )
to the man, to the fetus and to the commissioner. They should be 
ordered into a system, as in fact they are. In such a system the same 
technique would be represented on different levels corresponding 
to different ends. For example, psychoanalytic technique enters 
into the mechanisms of propaganda, the modem school, and voca­
tional guidance. Here, however, I shall try only to describe as 
soberly and briefly as possible the basic themes, subjects, and prin­
ciples of the problem. It would be useless to describe them at 
length or in great detail. A condensed description will bring the 
facts into sharp relief, and that must suffice.
Educational Technique. All of us who were adult in 1950 in 
France preserved a vivid memory of dismal schools where teachers 
were enemies and punishment was a constant menace; of narrow, 
barred windows, gloomy brown walls, and uncomfortable benches 
hollowed out by generations of bored students. The smell of sour 
milk, dirty smocks and snot-nosed kids made a unique impression 
that a young instructor would never forget. We well remcml>er 
books without illustrations, incomprehensible lessons learned by 
rote, discipline, and boredom. We had a healthy fear of the mas­
ters, upon whom we played our tricks. We feared some of our fel­
low pupils too, especially those who sat behind us, against whom 
we were unarmed. The students were divided into the weak and the 
Strong, much like an embryonic political structure where the weak 
quickly band together. There was pitiless competition in respect 
to studies, marks, and places. Categories were simple then: work 
was a curse, the school Wii d iiuaii.It; world, and the greater society 
outside its walls seemed to be the same. All superiors were ene­
mies. There were the snivelers who wanted only to get by, and 
the tough characters strong enough to dispense with the kind of 
success school life offered. All the rest were either cowed or re­
bellious, according to their natures. These were the ancient and 
familiar categories of school life which were suddenly overthrown 
by the extension of a series of techniques that we call techniques 
de tecole nouvelle— progressive education.
Progressive education has as its end the “happiness" of the child. 
It entails bright classrooms, understanding teachers, and pleasur­
able work. Its educational formulas are well-known: the child in 
school must be “relaxed" and enjoy himself; he must exist in a 
“balanced environment,” get rid of his “complexes,” and “play
The Technological Society ( 3 4 5
while he is learning.” All this represents a perfectly valid program. 
It has the elements of genial scholarship derived from the cele­
brated saying of Montaigne to the effect that we must stop cram­
ming children’s skulls to pass the baccalaureate; supercharging 
their brains with encyclopedic knowledge to the detriment of all 
other activities. Education must seek, rather, to develop in a bal­
anced way all their faculties, physical, manual, psychic, and intel­
lectual, and in this last, it must seek to stress personal observation 
and reasoning instead of rote learning. Moreover, the whole process 
is supposed to take place with the minimum possible use of force. 
It is essential to respect the person of the child and to individualize 
instruction to the maximum. Instruction is part of total education 
and is not addressed to the intelligence alone. Its method, based on 
the maieutic *  of Socrates, consists in bringing the child himself 
to discover the properties of objects or, starting from facts he him­
self observes, the principles which underlie them. This educational 
procedure is, however, a highly refined technique, detailed and 
rigorous; and it makes the most exacting demands on the tech­
nician himself, who must indeed be a remarkable pedagogue to 
be able to apply it It is not a mechanical technique that applies 
itself almost ipso facto. The same holds for the majority of the 
human techniques we shall discuss. The person of the technician 
counts for a very great deal, especially since these techniques are in 
their infancy.
Clearly, the child so educated will be much better balanced and 
in a better position to develop his own personality. It is beside the 
point to note how inadequately this program has been applied in 
France and how meager have been its results. It has been a prob­
lem, for example, to recruit enough qualified teachers to make it 
possible to assign students to classes of no more than fifteen. Diffi­
culties have been experienced in adapting the new methods to the 
old-time examination programs, which remain unchanged; this of 
course vitiates the system and results in overburdening the child. 
There are difficulties with regard to school location and equipment. 
But these stumbling blocks seem to me only of secondary impor­
tance. They represent transitional problems of adaptation which,
* Maieutic (from the Greek word for “ m idwife"): a term applied by Socrates to his 
method of teaching which was designed to bring to clear consciousness what was 
already present but hidden in the recesses of the mind. (Trans.)
HUMAN TECHNIQUES34 « )
in the normal course of events, will disappear. In a “normalized” 
society the new school is the only possible system; and when the 
importance of the education it has to offer has been understood, 
no sacrifice will be spared to secure the application of its method. 
Recall the sacrifices of the Hitler regime and of the Communists in 
behalf of education. The new education is a governing principle of 
every modern political system and of technique as a whole.
We come here to one of the most important problems raised by 
the new method: the child’s personality development. The problem 
is to put the child in the best possible situation and to prepare him 
optimally for the tasks that await him. These are phrases that are 
heard everywhere, as for example in the following statement drawn 
from a speech of Mme Montessori to UNESCO:
We must awaken the child’s social conscience. I know that it is a 
complicated educational question, but the child who will become 
the man must be able to understand life and its needs, the funda­
mental reason for all existence, the search for happiness . . . He 
must know exactly what he must do and what he must not do for 
the good of humanity . . .  To reach these ends, we must prepare 
the child to understand the meaning and necessity of the entente 
among the nations. The organization of the peace devolves more 
on education than on politics. To secure peace practically, we must 
envision a humane education, psychopedagogy, which affects not 
one nation but all men on earth . . . Education must become a 
truly humane science to guide all men to judge the present situ­
ation correctly.
This statement seems to me truly remarkable in that it designates 
candidly the end of psychopedagogic technique in the best pos­
sible circumstances, within a liberal and democratic conception of 
man, state, and society. ( Mme Montessori is a liberal and speaks 
for liberal countries.) I have taken Mme Montessorfs statement by 
way of example; but one could examine the purpose of this tech­
nique in numerous other pedagogical studies published in the past 
few years.
We note first of all that this technique must be implemented by 
the state, which alone has the means and the breadth to carry it 
through. But the rigorous application of the psychopedagogic tech­
nique means the end of private instruction— and therefore of a 
traditional freedom.
The Technological Society (347
Second, this technique is “pantocrator.”4  It must be exercised 
over all men. If one man is left who is not trained according to its 
methods, there is the danger of his becoming a new Hitler. The 
technique cannot be effected unless all children are obliged to par­
ticipate and all parents to co-operate. There can be no exceptions. 
If only a minority are educated to comply, this technique can re­
solve none of the problems it is intended to meet. Mme Montes- 
sori's statement is therefore neither a metaphor nor an exaggera­
tion; all human beings, without exception, must be reached. We 
note again the aggressive character of technique. Mme Montessori 
emphasizes the fact that “it is necessary to free the child from the 
slavery of school and family” for him to enter the cycle of freedom 
proper to this technique. However, this freedom consists in a 
profound and detailed surveillance of the child’s activities, a com­
plete shaping of his spiritual life, and a precise regulation of his 
time with a stop watch; in short, in habituating him to a joyful 
serfdom. The most important aspect of this technique is the forced 
(mentation toward it. It is a social force directed toward a social 
end.
The education of the child, however, is not directed toward some 
merely abstract social end. Concretely, the child must develop a 
social conscience, understand that the meaning of life is the good 
of humanity, and grasp the need for an entente among all nations. 
These ideas are much less vague than one might think. The good 
of humanity, for example, is not the obscure notion the philoso­
phers pretend it to be. At most, it varies somewhat with the 
political regime; and even this variability is becoming less and less 
pronounced. Compare Life magazine with the Soviet News and 
you will see that the “good of humanity” is conceived in almost 
identical terms in the United States and in the Soviet Union; the 
difference lies mainly in the persons charged with securing it  In 
both cases, the social good can be reduced to a few concrete and 
precise factors. The corresponding educational technique, as a 
consequence, takes a completely determinate direction. Social con­
formism must be impressed upon the child: he must be adapted to 
his society; he must not impair its development. His integration 
into the body social must be assured with the least possible friction.
*Pantocrator— a Creek word signifying “ omnipotent.'' It was an epithet applied to 
Yahweh, Lord of Hosts, and to the Byzantine emperors. (Trans.)
HUMAN TECHNIQUES348)
This technique of alleged liberation of the child cannot be ori­
ented differently, even if it were so desired. The technique permits 
the broadening of the child, the development of his social per­
sonality and happiness, and consequently, of his equilibrium. Op­
position to society, the lack of social adaptation, produces serious 
personality difficulties which lead to the loss of psychic equilib­
rium. One of the most important factors in the child’s education 
therefore is social adaptation. This means that— despite all the 
pretentious talk about the aims of education— it is not the child 
in and for himself who is being educated, but the child in and for 
society. And the society, moreover, is not an ideal one, with full 
justice and truth, but society as it is.
When a society becomes increasingly totalitarian (and I say 
“society,” not “state” ), it creates more and more difficulties of 
adaptation and requires its citizens to be conformist in the same 
degree. Thus, this technique becomes all the more necessary. I 
have no doubt that it makes men better balanced and “happier.” 
And there is the danger. It makes men happy in a milieu which 
normally would have made them unhappy, if they had not been 
worked on, molded, and formed for just that milieu. What looks 
like the apex of humanism is in fact the pinnacle of human sub­
mission: children are educated to become precisely what society 
expects of them. They must have social consciences that allow 
them to strive for the same ends as society sets for itself. Clearly, 
when modem youth are fully educated in the new psycliupedagogic 
technique, many social and political difficulties will disappear. Any 
form of government or social transformation becomes possible with 
individuals who have experienced this never-ending process of 
adaptation. The key word of the new human techniques is, there­
fore, adaptation, and we shall come upon it repeatedly as we con­
sider each of these techniques separately.
The new pedagogical methods correspond exactly to the role 
assigned to education in modem technical society. The Napoleonic 
conception that the Lycees must furnish administrators for the 
state and managers for the economy, in conformity with social 
needs and tendencies, has become world-wide in its extent. Ac­
cording to this conception, education no longer has a humanist end 
or any value in itself; it has only one goal, to create technicians. A

survey conducted by the newspaper Combat In 1950 appeared 
under the headline: Higher Education Has Ho Relation to Indus­
trial Needs. A survey conducted by Le Monde in 1952 began with 
the words: “There are too many half-baked intellectuals and not 
enough technicians.” It would be useless to multiply such refer­
ences. They are literally infinite in number since they express every­
body’s feelings in the matter. Instruction must be useful in life. 
Today’s life is technique. It follows, then, that instruction must 
above all else be technical. This is all very well for the individual 
preoccupied with finding a trade or a profession; but we find the 
same tendency when we look at society as a whole. Technique has 
again effected the reconciliation of individual and society.
Education, even in France, is becoming oriented toward the spe­
cialized end of producing technicians; and, as a consequence, to­
ward the creation of individuals useful only as members of a tech­
nical group, on the basis of the current criteria of utility— individ­
uals who conform to the structure and the needs of the technical 
group. The intelligentsia will no longer be a model, a conscience, 
or an animating intellectual spirit for the group, even in the sense 
of performing a critical function. They will be the servants, the 
most conformist imaginable, of the instruments of technique. As 
Louis Couffignal puts it, the human brain must be made to conform 
to the much more advanced brain of the machine. And education 
will no longer be an unpredictable and exciting adventure in 
human enlightenment, but an exercise in conformity and an ap­
prenticeship to whatever gadgetry is useful in a technical world. 
The Technique of Work. The day is still a long way off when we 
will have at our disposal men educated in accordance with the 
new methods. It will be another half century at the earliest before 
they mature; time is needed for organizing them. In France we 
must count on two decades for generalizing them and breaking 
them in and on another two decades for the results to become 
evident in the whole generation so educated. The tempo of change 
will perhaps be more rapid in the United States and in the Soviet 
Union and less rapid in the rest of Europe.
In the meantime, society must continue to function. During the 
interim period, another powerful system of adaptation will be put 
into effect: the complex of work techniques. This technical complex
HUMAN TECHNIQUES350)
includes vocational guidance, the organization of labor, the physi­
ology of work, and so on. Here again we find the assertion that 
progress is in the direction of a certain “humanism.”
Work techniques began with the world of the machine and dis­
played scant regard for human beings. Machines were invented 
and assembled, buildings were put up around them, and men were 
put inside. For fifty years the procedure was completely haphazard. 
Then it was noted that the worker’s productivity could be markedly 
increased by imposing certain rules on him. The result was the sys­
tem associated with the names of the Americans Frederick Winslow 
Taylor and Henry Ford. As Georges Friedmann has shown, they 
took nothing into consideration beyond the necessities of produc­
tion and the maximum utilization of the machine; they completely 
ignored the serfdom these factors entail— with their production 
lines, their infinite subdivision of tasks, and so on.
The objection will be raised, and rightly so, that this system was 
gradually changed and eventually became concerned not so much 
with questions of maximal exploitation as with optimal results. 
Worker fatigue (a topic we still don’t know enough about) became 
the subject of intense investigations. The importance of the human 
factor was recognized. And it even began to be recognized that 
this was insufficient, that man was still only one “factor” among 
many, and not the most important. It became necessary to recog­
nize the primacy of the whole human being, to adapt the work to 
the man, and to take the worker’s psychological equilibrium into 
consideration. It goes without saying that the motive force behind 
all this was the recognition that human psychology reacts directly 
upon productivity. When the worker feels that he is in a hostile 
environment and in an economic system opposed to his interests, 
he will not work (and this is involuntary) with the same ardor 
and skill. All this, according to Friedmann, posed the problem of 
the economic regime as a whole. Economic improvement is not of 
itself a strong enough tendency to allow the worker as producer 
to benefit from technical progress, although he may have benefited 
greatly from it as consumer. Purely material transformations in 
the conditions of labor are insufficient. They are doubtless neces­
sary to begin with, but physiological adaptation is not the only 
kind. Hygiene and safety must indeed be improved; the best loca­
tion must be selected, and even music may have to be exploited
The Technological Society (  351
to make labor more rhythmic and less disagreeable. But this is still 
not enough. The true problem is psychological. The worker is con­
fronted by cut-and-dried procedures that must be carried out in 
unvarying sequence in order that work be systematic, rational, and 
efficient; he is bored, slowed down, and psychologically con­
strained. It is necessary to arouse in him reflective thought and to 
make him participate in the life of the entire plant. He must be 
made to feel a community of interest; the idea that his labor has 
social meaning must be instilled in him. In short, he must be inte­
grated into the enterprise in which he is working. This integration 
will take different forms in different countries. It may take the form 
of a manufacturing structure like that of Bata,5  or it may consist of 
social, sports, or educational arrangements. Integration may mean 
worker participation in finance or management or, in an extreme 
case, the application of a thorough system such as "public rela­
tions” or "human engineering.” It suffices here to point out some 
of the many techniques of integration without going into their 
quite varied mechanisms.
Some excellent results have been achieved along this line. For 
example, the tendency to adapt the machine to man and to assert 
man’s primacy over the machine has produced a body of respect­
able research. Until recently, very few designers and manufacturers 
of machine tools bothered much about the workers who were to use 
the tools. It represents enormous progress for them to acknowledge 
that machines should be built with the workers in mind, that 
the human being ought to be the point of departure. However, 
the further they advance in this direction, the more complicated the 
problem appears. They were at first concerned primarily with the 
elimination of physical fatigue; having succeeded in this, they 
find that nervous or mental fatigue is now a problem. Business 
machines are highly adapted to the worker from a material point 
of view; physical effort has been almost completely reduced by the 
progressive elimination of fatigue due to standing, sensory Over­
burdening, and the need for overtime work. But the reduction of 
physical effort has only served to increase fatigue due to mental 
concentration, reflex attention, and dissymmetry of motion, factors 
which rapidly produce nervous exhaustion. It was certainly not
* Thomas Bata (1876-1932) was a Czech industrialist who made his shoe factories 
at Zlin into a federation of independent "studios.”  (Trans.)
HUMAN TECHNIQUES35^)
anticipated that machines designed (or man, and well adapted to 
him physically, would occasion even more rapid deterioration and 
an accelerated aging of their operators. Indeed, worker produc­
tivity markedly decreases after only four years, and, in general, 
becomes marked at age twenty-two. The optimum age of an em­
ployee who operates business machines would seem to lie between 
sixteen and twenty-two. Now, this last fact comes from the machine 
in itself, from its tempo, and so on. The human problem has been 
intensified, rather than resolved. It even seems insoluble. The con­
cern for the human being that is evident in these attempts must, 
one supposes, be reckoned progress; the same holds for the tech­
nician’s concern with the person of the worker, and the attempts to 
furnish him with means for self-improvement by establishing li­
braries or by helping him resolve his personal problems.
But on further consideration, are not these efforts and this in­
terest part of an abstract ideal? What do they really signify? Leon 
Walther, the great theoretician of the adaptation of machine to 
man, states that this adaptation has as its end “the maximum 
productivity with the minimum expenditure of human energy.” 
But such a goal represents a primacy of efficiency, with reference 
both to man and machine. The greater concern is to make men 
work effectively; and, marvelous dispensation, advantages for pro­
duction turn out to coincide with advantages for the individual.
One of the principal creators of libraries for workers has de­
scribed the concept of “practical utility” which ought to govern 
such libraries. Books are to be selected on the basis of “their even­
tual moral yield.” If a book enables the worker to escape the direct 
control of the bosses, “it ought to be authorized only to the degree 
that the subject treated allows the management to exercise control 
indirectly.” With this proviso, a book can be an invaluable auxil­
iary, since it introduces personal interest, serves as a source of 
initiative, and satisfies curiosity; but on the condition that the 
worker is ignorant of what he ought to know and that management 
has the “duty” to choose for him.
It might, incidentally, be asked: “Are these ideas capitalist or 
Communist?” Anyone who could give an unambiguous answer to 
this question would indeed be an expert, for the same conceptions 
occur as frequently in one system as in the other. They do not 
represent theories, but are the direct expression of the fact that
The Technological Society (3 S3
work technique necessitates the complete integration o£ the worker. 
It is inadmissible that the worker's reading matter should occasion 
slowdowns, rebellion, or displacement of the center of interest 
Such things are unthinkable, whatever the regime. Culture must 
conform to technique and encouraige productivity. Censorship in 
this area ought therefore not to be regarded as an evil, but as an 
unavoidable condition of objective technique. The same holds for 
the surprising creation of the post of “counselors,” of which Fried­
mann has written. After it had been observed in certain industrial 
plants that the conditions of modem labor provoke psychological 
difficulties, psychologists were hired to act as “safety valves” for 
employee grievances and dissatisfactions. Employees may express 
their feelings to these “counselors” with the assurance that the 
counselors will say nothing to management. But the counselors 
never actually counsel anything. Their activities have nothing what­
ever to do with a positive cure of the soul, a mission which would 
suppose at least the possibility of profound changes, new orienta­
tions, and an awakening consciousness on the worker's part, all of 
which are highly dangerous. Nor are the counselors concerned with 
investigations of concrete modifications that might be binding on 
the company. Their sole duty is to encourage the voicing of com­
plaints and to listen to them. It is well-known that suffering ex­
pressed is suffering relieved. It has been observed that certain 
psychological disturbances are provoked simply by being silent 
and that rebellions are nourished in secret. To let people talk does 
them good and quashes revolt It is dangerous to allow the workers 
to talk over their problems among themselves. It is far more 
prudent to give them a safety valve in the form of a discreet com­
pany agent, a psychological technician, than to let them air their 
grievances in public. These “counselors" play the same role on the 
industrial level as the Soviet magazine KrokodU does on the politi­
cal. It is difficult to find a human interest in any of this. The 
concern here is primarily with technical development. The pallia­
tion of the human difficulties raised by technique is secondary. 
Michel Crozier asserts that this is true also for the technique called 
“human engineering.”
This situation exists also in other disciplines (for example, in 
sociology), which forces us to conclusions that seem in no sense 
subjective. Social research establishes the primacy of the socio-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES354}
logical over the human: it is not concerned only with man’s indi­
vidual psychology and physiology, but also with his relation to the 
body social. Here the important problem is to make him really 
belong to the social group. The problem is the same for a socialized 
as for a capitalist economy. A solution may perhaps be more 
feasible for a capitalist society, but both are faced with the problem 
of convincing man and gaining his allegiance. This gives rise to yet 
another human technique, which I shall refer to later on. At this 
point let us consider its aims.
In Aspects sociaux de la rationalisation, the 1931 report of the In­
ternational Labor Organization, we read that "it is necessary to 
rationalize not only manufacturing, but also employer-employee 
relations.” And in 1941 the ILO asserted that “only when industrial 
technique succeeds in developing concern for the human being will 
American capitalism win the confidence of its workers, customers, 
and bond holders, of the public individually and collectively.’' As 
Friedmann puts it, the purpose of the scientific organization of 
labor, before and after the advent of psychotechnique, industrial 
relations, and technical humanism, was and is to “assure maximal 
yield with minimal loss of effort or material. But these latter repre­
sent means which are becoming complicated and refined to the 
point of transforming little by little the face of the scientific or­
ganization of labor.” The system of human relations which is being 
re-created in the industrial framework is constructed, according to 
its originators, on the basis of an industrial model. In this respect 
the study of W. E. Moore is significant. According to Moore, human 
relations must correspond to the functions of individuals engaged 
in the production cycle. Moore assigns the following four char­
acteristics to human relations:
First, human relations must be restricted to the technical de­
mands of their vocational role. They must not become deep rela­
tions involving profound ideas, tendencies, and preoccupations. 
Individuals who are part of the industrial tempo must remain hu­
man and sustain mutual human relationships, but only those that 
relate to technical activity.
Second, human relations must be universal; they must be "based 
on criteria which the members of an arbitrary grouping of the 
population can satisfy, independently of prior social relations or 
prior membership in other groups unconnected with the work in
The Technological Society ' (355
hand.” In other words, human relations must not have an extra- 
technical basis. The individual’s prior milieu is of little importance; 
neither are his prior preferences or tendencies. Technique compen­
sates for everything else. It is therefore reasonable to speak of 
technical “universalism.” Technique is the bond between men; it 
is both objective and indeterminate; it makes up for individual 
deficiencies, admitting no excuses or individual dissociation.
The third characteristic of human relations is rationality. Human 
relations are indispensable to the proper functioning of the or­
ganism as a whole. The organism is strictly rational, and relations 
integrated into it must be conceived on a rational basis. Emotion or 
sentementality must not be allowed to disturb the mechanism. 
When the problem of emotion is considered, as, for example, in 
“molar microsociological analysis,” it is treated as a function of the 
greater rationality of the group and of a more objective equilib­
rium.
In the fourth place, these relations must be impersonal, estab­
lished not on the basis of subjective choice and for personal rea­
sons but on the basis of their optimum validity. Of course, subjec­
tive choice and personal reasons must also be dealt with insofar 
as they influence the technician, but they are stripped of spon­
taneous validity;-they are only one element in the situation.
Scott and Lynton, in a rather more versatile study made in 
1953, confirm Moore’s analysis. According to them, in the technical 
complex which our society has become, and which is destroying 
every kind of community, it is necessary to compensate for man’s 
natural incapacity to sustain human relations in a technical uni­
verse. This must be done not only for man’s sake but also because 
human relations are technically indispensable to the progress of 
great enterprises. It is necessary, therefore, to organize groups in 
these enterprises, groups which are responsible but also sufficiently 
directed to serve the common end, productivity. Then it is neces­
sary to reproduce natural conditions artificially, so that human re­
lations can be established. For example, the enterprise can be given 
an administrative structure that reproduces a spontaneous organi­
zation.
The technique of so-called human relations, developed to adapt 
the individual to the technical milieu, to force him to accept his 
slavery, to make him find happiness by the “normalization” of his
HUMAN TECHNIQUES356)
relations with his group and integrate him into that group to an 
ever greater degree— this technique is characteristic of the fakeries 
and shams with which men must be provided if the conflicts pro­
voked by life in a technicized environment are to be avoided. As 
a remedy it does not amount to much, but as a symptom of techni­
cal reinforcement, it is important. We can say that these personal 
relations are also techniques, that they are not a counterweight to 
other techniques, but that they bring about the application of tech­
nique in the most personal and immediate area of human activi­
ties: man’s relations with other men. They alleviate the rigors of 
the human condition— but only by forcing man to submit to them 
more completely. They facilitate both human life and the action of 
the machinery, improve production while subordinating human 
spontaneity to the mathematical calculations of the technicians. In 
short, they are a kind of lubricating oil, but scarcely a means by 
which men can recover a sense of worth, personality, and authen­
ticity. On the contrary, they are a delusion which desiccate the 
individual’s desire for anything better. Man is doubtless made more 
comfortable by techniques of human relations; but these techniques 
are wholly oriented toward compelling man to submit to forced 
labor. Machine and productivity are in the driver’s seat.
All I have said concerning the technique of human relations is as 
true of a socialist as of a capitalist society. “Socialist rivalry” is only 
a psychological tool to force men to work harder. The effort to 
integrate man into large-scale enterprises is n o t  restricted to capi 
talism; it stems from technical investigations which are universally 
valid. The most that can be said is that under capitalism psycho­
logical techniques are concentrated on the problem of integrating 
the individual into private enterprise- Under socialism they are 
more generalized.
None of this arises from human malevolence, or from some “sys­
tem,” but from the simple fact that other techniques are sought to 
answer the problems of industrial mechanization. There is no op­
position between mechanical techniques, on the one hand, and or­
ganizational and psychological techniques, on the other, so that 
the latter balance the former. Such a relationship is valid, but only 
within the larger technical phenomenon, within the universal 
scheme whereby men are determined as objects by the whole tech-
The Technological Society ( 357
nical complex with a view to efficiency. Hence, as I have observed 
in so many other connections, the instrumentalities which permit 
man to survive, and even be happy, subject him as much and even 
more than the other techniques to the technical ideal, which is in­
dependent of all real humanism. The correlated growth of machine 
and organization prove this point. The organization of work, psy­
chological research, the apparent adaptation of the machine to the 
human being— these in fact permit the aggrandizement of the me­
chanical. The greater the aggrandizement, the more society re­
quires that countermeasures be taken; but since the countermeas­
ures are themselves of a technical nature, they allow the sphere of 
the mechanical to develop even further in a vicious circle. To be­
lieve that humanist remedies will indeed palliate the drawbacks 
of the machine is to think of the machine as a static fact. It is noth­
ing of the kind. The progress of the machine depends on the pro­
posed humanist remedies, and they in turn are rendered obsolete 
by each new mechanical development.
I should like to point out one last fact; it touches upon a tender 
point, and such a brief treatment may shock some people. Labor 
and trade unions made their appearance as the great human pro­
test against the inhuman character of capitalism and its exploita­
tion of the workers. However, in all countries labor unionism has 
completely lost its original character and become a purely techni­
cal organization. This seems to be undeniable, whether we study 
unionism in its Soviet form as a state organism or in its American 
form as an adjunct to production. In both cases trade unionism no 
longer represents a fighting force, but rather a technical adminis­
tration. At the moment unionism is still a fighting force in France 
and Italy, but in such an impersonal and organized form that the 
outcome is clear.
Once again, the result appears to be technical. The worker is be­
coming more and more "organizable.” He is trapped in labor or­
ganizations which are becoming increasingly compulsory and in­
creasingly efficient. He gets habituated to them and even feels a 
need for them. Moreover, the modem separation between person­
ality and work favors surrender to organization. The worker easily 
yields to the conviction that by contributing to his own organiza­
tion he will be able to modify the broad outlines of the system and
HUMAN TECHNIQUES358)
alleviate his own discomforts. He does not realize that the organi­
zation he is enrolled in is itself part of the complex of technical 
organisms of depersonalization. What we have here is a hoax, in 
the Marxist sense of the term. The actual function of unionism is 
to support technical progress. It seeks a profound transformation of 
the condition of the workers through objective industrial organiza­
tion, independent of the idea of capitalist profit. It finds unorgan­
ized labor insupportable; this is also its attitude toward the inde­
pendent workers who have not felt the burden of the machine on 
their life and work. Unionism has no concept of the worker except 
in the double framework of factory and union, both in a technical 
sense.
When workers are organized, they are complying with the law 
of technical progress which requires all forms of human life to 
become organized. This explains the facility with which the un­
ions, once they have been tightly constructed, pass into the condi­
tion of total social organization. They continue to constitute an 
opposing force to certain men and economic tendencies, but they 
no longer represent a revolutionary force with respect to basic 
structures. On the contrary, they have become a part of these 
structures. The worker thinks that he is organizing freely and ex­
pressing his personality; but in so doing, he is merely yielding to 
the technical imperatives to which he is subject through the me­
chanical element in his work.
I have no thought of denying the educational value of the un­
ions or the contributions they have made to the improvement of 
the workers’ lot. I have been concerned merely to reflect (on a very 
different plane) to what a degree trade unionism has developed 
concurrently with technical progress and how it stands in im­
mediate relation to technical imperatives. The worker through his 
unions is intensifying his own thralldom to techniques, augmenting 
their powers of organization, and completing his own integration 
into that very movement from which, it may be, unionism had 
originally hoped to free him.
Vocational Guidance. Research on human beings at work has led to 
the differentiation of a number of categories of individuals accord­
ing to their greater or lesser aptitudes for adaptation, for example, 
to rationalized industrial labor. Some workers adapt themselves 
without difficulty to assembly-line production, whereas others be-
The Technological Society (3 5 9
come neurotic. This poses the problem of distinguishing various 
human categories of adaptability.
A new technique, vocational guidance, is the answer here. It 
claims to be able to reveal every person’s vocational aptitude and to 
guide him into the most suitable vocation, the vocation he will be 
naturally adapted to, the vocation in which he will do the best 
job with the most enjoyment.
Unfortunately, the first-rate work of Pierre Naville concerning 
this technique has demonstrated that its claims are not in complete 
correspondence with technical reality. I do not wish to consider 
the first part of his argument, which is exclusively Marxist. There 
are no natural aptitudes, he states; therefore vocational guidance 
could not possibly discover them. This point is of course, debat­
able for non-Marxists. The remainder of his argument is inde­
pendent of the first part and self-sufficient.
Before turning to Naville’s work, I would like to add that there is 
no question here of denying the value of testing. Tests as a whole 
yield trustworthy and worthwhile information. Except for certain 
reservations about detail, we can consider this technique efficient. 
But in order to estimate its value correctly, we must “situate” it. 
Techniques in the modem world cannot be separated from one 
another; and as a consequence the technique of vocational guid­
ance must be integrated into the complex of all the other tech­
niques, for example, into the system of political and economic 
techniques.
Naville shows with precision that what we call vocational guid­
ance answers the requirements of capitalist economic techniques. 
As though by accident, the technique “discovers” in the individ­
uals examined precisely the aptitudes which are essential to the 
needs of the capitalist economy. Thus, in France during the period 
of unemployment from 1932 to 1937, vocational guidance system­
atically diverted young people from such overcrowed trades as 
mechanics, textile work, and so on. The period from 1937 to 1939 
witnessed the development of metallurgy, and vocational guid­
ance “discovered” the vocation of metallurgist. In 1940 it was turn­
ing up a great number of agricultural vocations.
This should not be taken to mean that vocational guidance is 
the tool of capitalist or governmental whim. Nor does it mean that 
vocational guidance is an imprecise technique. It means simply
HUMAN TECHNIQUES360)
that there is a great flexibility in human potentialities and that 
vocational guidance modified these potentialities in accordance 
with the suggestions of other techniques.
Consider what would happen if vocational guidance proceeded 
to isolate itself from other techniques; for example, if it considered 
first and exclusively the aptitude of the individual. The result 
would be Otto Neurath’s nonsensical system, which would never­
theless be the only logical system if one were to insist that the 
exclusive preoccupation of vocational guidance is to find the best 
job for the individual in terms of his aptitudes. Neurath envisages 
a kind of plan of three to five years’ duration, based on the in­
dividual’s aptitudes as discerned by vocational guidance. The econ­
omy would be founded on these aptitudes. If vocational guidance 
discovered no mechanics, machine shops would be suppressed. If, 
presumably, it discovered no teachers, the schools would have to 
be closed. If, on the other hand, vocational guidance were to un­
cover a supply of mechanics after a number of years, the dis­
mantled machine shops would be reopened. It need scarcely be 
said that chaos would reign in the field of economics. But such a 
system would be the only logical one if we really were concerned 
exclusively with the primacy of the individual If we really wished 
to take into consideration only the individual’s aptitudes, we would 
have to tailor the economic system to them. The obvious impos­
sibility of such a system demonstrates that it is senseless to apply 
the rule of the primacy of the individual and that vocational guid­
ance cannot be isolated from the other techniques.
Naville, on the other hand, wishes to integrate vocational guid­
ance as far as possible into the technical complex; he maintains 
that this can be realized only under socialism. He takes as his 
example the Soviet Union, where vocational guidance tries to dis­
cover not so much intrinsic aptitudes as potentialities for adapta­
tion, that is, adaptability. Basically, the Soviets believe it nec­
essary to discover not the individual’s predestination but his 
adaptability. Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting 
the individual, through education, to planned manpower require­
ments. Vocational guidance is thus subordinated to planning tech­
nique. For example, a five-year plan may require a certain number 
of miners for that period. Vocational guidance then has the task^ 
of seeking out from among the twelve- and thirteen-year-olds the
The Technological Society (361
ones adaptable to this function. It institutes forthwith a twofold 
operation of general education focused on the particular trade 
and on the psychic, mechanical, and physiological adaptability of 
the candidates. The plan thus obtains the necessary manpower; 
the individual candidates are effectively adapted to the required 
labor, since they have been recruited at an early enough age and 
educated from the beginning in a precise direction. The em­
phasis again is on insuring the happiness of the individual through 
adaptation. The assumption is that the individual will be happy 
when he is synchronized with his trade.
Soviet orientation toward vocational guidance is identical with 
certain recent tendencies which have appeared in America. In a 
report to UNESCO on technical education and vocational guid­
ance, Margaret Mead wrote: “Since education must respond, not 
to the present but to the future needs of society, it is necessary to 
forecast constantly and as far as possible in advance the evolution 
of vocational structures.” This can only mean that the individual 
must be educated and adapted in advance to his future job as a 
function of anticipated technical progress. In Mayo’s analyses and 
in Lynton’s report to UNESCO, one finds similarly precise expres­
sions of the conditions of community survival in the technical 
world. The issue in all these cases is the rigorous adaptation of the 
individual to the world of technique, even going as far as the “re­
production of certain modes of action and forms of spontaneous 
organization.” More precise expression of technical intrusion into 
life could scarcely be imagined.
It must not be thought that Naville’s version of vocational guid­
ance restricts human potentialities. On the contrary, it is meant to 
enlarge the child’s possibilities of adaptation. By means of this 
technique, according to Naville, “certain newly acquired habits 
will appear, thanks to which the individual will be able to partici­
pate in the whole continuum of social effort . . . His needs will 
be guided into a system of new habits which the economic milieu 
bequeathes to him . . . Adaptation will no longer be something 
natural, but will be acquired at the cost of efforts which will be 
of short or long duration depending on the complexity of the 
task.”
In this connection, we are assured that “vocational guidance 
will permit the basic satisfaction of any rational need.” I am con-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES362)
vinced that this statement is exact. The individual so educated 
will be satisfied. But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that 
vocational guidance is in the service of human beings. An arsenal 
of preconceptions and undemonstrable formulas would be needed 
to sustain such a thesis. These presuppositions are as follows: 
(1) The moment the individual finds himself in a socialist system, 
his complexes disappear. (2) The moment an institution is inte­
grated into a socialist system, it changes character. (3) The mo­
ment the individual’s needs are satisfied, he becomes happy. (4) 
The moment social harmony is established, every man integrated 
into that harmonious system realizes his human vocation. (5) The 
moment the individual escapes from capitalism, he is free. Such 
nonsense is only a way of refusing to consider facts or to look reality 
in the face. The facts are clear enough. In isolation from certain 
other techniques, vocational guidance is useless. Put back into its 
true context, it becomes simply a means for subordinating man to 
the requirements of economic technique. Even when the task of 
discovering aptitudes is attributed to vocational guidance, as, for 
example, in Antoine Mas’s "personnel mechanograph,” there is 
nevertheless a substantial consideration of “ad-aptitude,” to use 
Naville’s word, and selection is made in terms of it.
Once again we are confronted with a mechanism of adaptation 
which deprives man of freedom and responsibility, makes him 
into a “thing,” and puts him where he is most desirable from the 
point of view of another technique, that is where he is most 
efficient.
We can also state that a kind of encounter is taking place be­
tween vocational guidance and the “new school.” Vocational guid­
ance is not obligatory in France. It might even be said that it does 
not yet exist as a technique. It is still an advisory organ, nothing 
more. The trend, however, is unmistakable. The number of children 
counseled went from 60,000 in 1944 to 250,000 in 1950, and, it is 
estimated, an average of 75 per cent of the parents followed the 
advice of the vocational counselor. (The actual figure grew slowly 
from 73 per cent in 1944 to 78 per cent in 1950.) As to the long­
term effects of guidance upon those guided, it need only be re­
marked that either the counselor was right or the counseled child, 
once embarked on a trade, is faced with an accomplished fact. 
Practically speaking, there is no retreat, and in fact, a retreat is
The Technological Society (363
seldom desired. The statement that vocational guidance, consider­
ing its rate of growth, is not obligatory in reality signifies very 
little.
An analysis of the method itself should be made. Although the 
tests employed at the moment are not very dangerous, the aim of 
vocational guidance is to card-index the individual totally (natu­
rally, for his own good), and it is unlikely that its practitioners will 
remain very long content with the common psychotechnical tests. 
They will want to go much further, to make systematic investiga­
tions of emotional tendencies and to explore the child’s instinctive 
nature, to inquire into the basic elements in the child’s psychic 
and moral make-up. Tests like the so-called TAT (“Thematic Ap­
perception Test”) already aim in this direction. Another and balder 
way of putting it is that vocational guidance represents a totali­
tarian takeover of the young.
But since such a takeover lies in the logic of the system, I hardly 
think it can be prevented. 1 shall content myself with referring the 
interested reader to the excellent critique of the system contained 
in William Hollingsworth Whyte’s The Organization Man. 
Propaganda. Here we are faced with a new system of human tech­
niques, more complex than the others we have studied, since it 
involves techniques of different natures, partly hierarchical and 
partly synthetic. We do not even have a term to describe this 
system. Propaganda is too limited, but it comes closest to the fact.* 
The term supposes state action and also mass action on public 
opinion. However, the broader phenomenon we are considering 
here includes private action and individualized action as well.
The prime consideration is the union of two very different cate­
gories of technique which yield this new system of human tech­
nique. The first is a complex of mechanical techniques (principally 
radio, press, and motion pictures) which permit direct communi­
cation with a very large number of persons collectively, while 
simultaneously addressing each individual in the group. These 
techniques possess an extraordinary power of persuasion and a 
remarkable capacity to bring psychic and intellectual pressure 
to bear. The second category consists of a complex of psychological 
(and even psychoanalytical) techniques which give access to exact
•Here I am  giving the briefest summary. The interested reader may refer to m y 
book, Propagandes (1962), which will shortly appear in English.
3 ^ 4 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
knowledge of the human psyche. It can thus be motivated with 
considerable confidence in the results.
A number of techniques have here been brought to a common 
focus so as to produce a nearly certain result. It is known in ad­
vance that the projected image will almost infallibly produce the 
desired reflex. The technical phenomenon under consideration 
unites the two categories into an inseparable whole. The question 
arises how and why this has come about and whether man has 
willed it.
If the press had been devoted exclusively to serial stories, and the 
radio to music, it might not have been necessary to bring in psy­
choanalytic methods. But even this is not certain. What could be 
more innocent in appearance than comic strips? The deep in­
fluence of these “comics” on the reader is demonstrable, as is their 
usefulness from the sociological point of view. And what could 
seem more harmless than an American musical comedy film? Yet 
we are all aware of their economic importance.
Even if the radio or the press had been exclusively devoted to 
amusement, however, there would be this problem: on what basis 
could or should these techniques be restricted? The moment they 
could be applied to other spheres (politics, for example), they 
were applied, and applied guilelessly, without anyone having, at 
least in the beginning, any clear idea of their utility. As soon as 
they entered the realm of politics, it became evident that they had 
to serve not only to educate but also to convince. There is no such 
thing as purely objective information. To object that it was man’s 
fault that technique did not remain objective is tantamount to 
stating that it was man’s fault to be human. From the moment 
these techniques were put to use, they had to operate as efficiently 
as possible, which meant that other techniques for understanding 
man had to be drawn into the system.
The totalitarian state is very often accused of having.originated 
the conjunction of techniques. This is Monnerot’s opinion. The fact 
is that private capitalism did indeed initiate this conjunction; con­
ditions under capitalism were more propitious than elsewhere. Ad­
vertising, well before propaganda proper, introduced the concep­
tion of efficiency in this field. The problem was to convince a large 
number of persons, all typed as “average,” to perform some simple 
action, for example, to buy a given object. It was necessary to be
The Technological Society (365
convincing with limited arguments and few words, which might 
well be lost among hundreds of others. Conditions in advertising 
were much more favorable to the conjunction of mechanical and 
psychological means than, say, political conditions at the beginning 
of the twentieth century. At that time attempts at political per­
suasion were addressed only to the elite. There was a multiplicity 
of political and doctrinaire arguments, but only a few propagan­
dists means. Propagandists inertia in politics was the result. Po­
litical persuasion had as its aim purely intellectual conviction, 
whereas in advertising theendwasto produce reflex action.
Large commercial enterprises were the first to supplement me­
chanical techniques with the very efficient means available through 
psychological technique. By 1910 this conjunction was an accom­
plished fact. A  kind of maladroit political propaganda first came 
into use during the First World War. It was often completely inept 
because it disregarded psychological laws and was, in effect, pure 
hokum. But it became scientific with the Russian Revolution and 
then with Hitlerism. Today all states without exception exploit the 
system of political propaganda created by the union of the two 
technical complexes.
What then are the principal directions taken by propaganda tech­
niques? The system of conditioned reflexes has been exploited on 
a large scale. The technique of measuring and producing such 
reflexes has been greatly developed. The reduction of political 
doctrines to programs, of programs to slogans, of slogans to pic­
tures (the direct reflex-stimulating images) has been studied. Sys­
tematic efforts are available to create conditioned reflexes, either 
through education (as, for example, under Nazism or under Com­
munism) or on the basis of already existing, spontaneous reflexes 
(for example, the American use of erotic reflexes in war propa­
ganda).
The propaganda mechanisms of the totalitarian states have been 
studied in detail by Tchakotin. Propaganda techniques in the 
United States have been stressed much less. But that does not 
mean that instances of propaganda on a grand scale are lacking 
there. It became necessary, for example, to force the American 
people to participate in the war and to impress a war psychology 
upon them by creating certain reflexes. The Americans, protected 
by their two oceans, did not “feel” they were at war. War for them
HUMAN TECHNIQUES366)
was not a living reality and had to be made so. Understandably, 
the feeling of war and civilian involvement in it could be produced 
only by the enormous pressure of advertising and total propaganda 
on the human psyche. It was necessary to use the so-called obses­
sional technique, to subject the citizen to propaganda without 
letup, never allowing him to be alone with Jffmself. In the street 
he is confronted with posters, loud-speakers, ceremonies, and meet­
ings; at work, with handbills and “industrial mobilization”; in his 
amusements, with motion-picture and theatrical propaganda; at 
home, with newspaper and radio propaganda. All these means 
converge on the same point. All exert the same kind of action on 
the individual and are of such overpowering magnitude that he 
ceases to be consciously aware of them.
This last is the greatest importance. Propaganda must become as 
natural as air or food. It must proceed by psychological inhibi­
tion and the least possible shock. The individual is then able to 
declare in all honesty that no such thing as propaganda exists. 
In fact, however, he has been so absorbed by it that he is literally 
no longer able to see the truth. The natures of man and propa­
ganda have become so inextricably mixed that everything depends 
not on choice or on free will, but on reflex and myth. The pro­
longed and hypnotic repetition of the same complex of ideas, the 
same images, and the same rumors conditions man for the as­
similation of his nature to propaganda.
In addition, human emotions such as hate and resentment are 
exploited. The procedure is not so much obsessional as suggestive, 
and depends on the collective fixation of these emotions on a given 
adversary. Here we witness the crowning absurdity, a completely 
automatic development of emotions. To exploit resentments, it is 
sufficient merely to send the individual on his way, equipped with 
a very simple set of “directions for use.” Later on, one observes a 
reconstitution of the individual personality around the selected 
“fixed point” on the basis of the strength of his resentments. Sup­
pose, for example, that the adversary has been designated as the 
author of all the individual’s misfortunes and sufferings. .(The 
bourgeoisie plays this role for the Communists, as the Jews played 
it for the Nazis.) After such suggestions have been launched, there 
is a surge of human resentment among the people. Like a flock of 
sheep, they stampede much further than they had actually been
The Technological Society (367
commanded to go, in obedience to another instinct which comes 
into play and which causes them to hurl themselves on the object of 
their resentment like a dog on a cat. Incidentally, this explains 
why there is no ‘‘criminal" in these cases. Pogroms are seldom 
ordered by the authorities. One need only manipulate popular 
resentments to bring them about.
The will to self-justification, which is latent in every individual, 
can also be exploited. It involves the need for a scapegoat; but 
individuals have difficulty finding a personal scapegoat. Propa­
ganda offers them a collective goat to which they are able to trans­
fer evil and sin, thereby feeling justified, authenticated, and puri­
fied. In all countries where this form of propaganda is effective, 
crime diminishes (not the least of the boasts of totalitarian regimes, 
Communist and Fascist alike). Morality makes headway. We no 
longer have to create for ourselves enemies to slay. We have ene­
mies, ready-made for us by propaganda, whom it is lawful to kill. 
It is as plain as a pikestaff that to kill a bourgeois is not a crime. 
Moreover, the introduction of scapegoats means that conflict is no 
longer on a social or political plane but on a moral plane of good 
and evil. In exploiting the device of the scapegoat, propaganda 
leads people to transfer evil to the adversary. The adversary here 
becomes the generalized incarnation of evil, whereas in the ex­
ploitation of resentment the adversary appears as the cause of 
misfortune. This incarnation indicates that there is no rational basis 
for hate; it results solely from subconscious mechanisms. This ex­
plains a surprising statement made by Hitler in Mein Kampf: “It 
is necessary to suggest to the people that the most varied enemies 
all belong to the same category; and to lump all adversaries to­
gether so that it will appear to the mass of our own partisans that 
the struggle is being waged against a single enemy. This fortifies 
their faith in their rights and increases their exasperation against 
those who would assail them.” Hitler s statement would have been 
completely irrational if it had been made about person-to-person 
combat, about personal reasons for conflict. But from the moment 
propaganda begins to operate, there is a loss of the sense of reality, 
a confusion of motives, an identification of opposites, and an inter­
play of accusations— all of which greatly enhance the operation 
of subconscious influences. Everything more or less confusedly 
resented as being evil is transferred to the official enemy. Through
368 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
the influence of propaganda, a subconscious transference takes 
place. But instead of the psychoanalyst who causes the transference 
of guilt feelings to himself, there is a propaganda machine which 
causes us to make the transference to the generalized enemy. 
Technique thus creates a separation between all “absolutely good” 
persons, who are collectively justified and who represent political, 
social, and historic virtue, and all “absolutely evil” persons,' in 
whom no worth or virtue is to be found. The phenomenon made a 
feeble appearance, on the national plane, in the 1914 "War of Law 
and Civilization,” but it was too weak to bring about complete 
collective transference. Today we are more successful, but the line 
of demarcation between good and evil is less national than social 
and political.
Propaganda also manipulates, on a lesser scale, the so-called 
Oedipus complex and our emotions concerning the "father.” These 
techniques are still halting, but it is quite probable that they will 
become efficient in the near future.
Propagandistic manipulations take place under all forms of gov­
ernment and in all walks of life. It may be said that we live in a 
universe which is psychologically subversive. Even so, modem 
man has no clear conception of the extent of the phenomenon. 
Experience cannot reveal it to him; he would have to be outside 
looking in. We in France are fortunate in living in a country 
where propaganda is still remarkably inefficient. In addition, we 
are acquainted with the technique of “social psychoanalysis.” as 
imported by the pre-1938 Berlin Institute of Applied Psychology 
and by numerous American institutes and research committees/ 
It is scarcely necessary to add that all propaganda technicians in 
search of the “one best way” loudly proclaim the value of ex­
ploiting the great subconscious motifs I have described.
It is only fair to wonder what consequences these propagandistic 
manipulations will have. The real consequences are not discernible 
because the mechanisms have been operating for too short a time. 
And, of course, when the consequences finally appear, we still 
will not recognize them. We will have been so absorbed and ma­
nipulated, rendered so indifferent that objective knowledge on

this score will be impossible. We will no longer even have any idea 
of what men might once have been.
Some effects of propaganda, however, are already clear.
1) The critical faculty has been suppressed by the creation of 
collective passions. The well-known phenomenon of “reciprocal 
suggestion” has made collective passion a very different force from 
individual passion. We know that individual passion is itself in­
imical to the critical faculty, but the critical faculty can still be 
exercised if some equilibrium can be established between criti­
cism and passion. In the collective passion created by technique 
(of which technique itself is sometimes the object), the critical 
faculty, which is peculiar to the intellectual organization of the 
individual, is excluded. As Monnerot says flatly: "There is no such 
thing as a collective critical faculty.” Because technique acts upon 
men collectively, the passions it provokes— which exist in every­
body— are amplified. The suppression of the critical faculty—  
man’s growing incapacity to distinguish truth from falsehood, the 
individual from the collectivity, action from talk, reality from 
statistics, and so on— is one of the most evident results of the 
technical power of propaganda. Human intelligence cannot resist 
propaganda’s manipulation of its subconscious.
2) A good social conscience appears with the suppression of the 
critical faculty. Technique provides justification to everybody 
and gives all men the conviction that their actions are just, good, 
and in the spirit of truth. This conviction is the stronger because it 
is collectively shared. The individual finds the same conviction in 
his fellow workers and neighbors and feels himself strengthened in 
it through the implicit communion of media such as the radio. In 
countries where propaganda technique is exploited, there is a de­
crease in neurosis as well as in crime. We can believe the wartime 
statistics of the Nazis and the Americans because they fit so well 
with everything else we know. Conversely, whenever for some 
reason propaganda technique fails to instill a good collective social 
conscience, there is a sudden and brutal collapse of the sense of 
individual justification, and individual morale falls drastically. 
This, among other things, would explain the extraordinary in­
crease in neuroses in the United States after 1945. A similar situa­
tion among the Germans may have other explanations, but I am 
convinced that the sudden halting in the Nazi propaganda ma-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 7°)
chine played a significant role in German postwar neurosis. The 
problem in the United States has been so serious that it has led to 
the dramatic development of psychoanalytic therapy in the past 
few years. This development in reality represents a resumption, on 
an individual level, of the activity which collective technique had 
abandoned. When a good collective social conscience has been 
created, the individual becomes addicted to it, as to a drug. And 
when the Americans realize that individual psychoanalysis is more 
costly, less efficient (because it cannot integrate the individual), 
and more difficult, they will return to a collective psychotherapeu­
tic technique.
3) Propaganda technique, moreover, creates a new sphere of 
the “sacred.” As Monnerot puts it: “When an entire category of 
events, beings, and ideas is outside criticism, it constitutes a sacred 
realm, in contrast to the realm of the profane.” As a result of the 
profound influence of the mechanisms of propaganda, a new zone 
of the forbidden is created in the heart of man, but it is artificially 
induced, in contrast to the taboos of primitive societies. When 
there is propaganda, we are no longer able to evaluate certain 
questions, or even to discuss them. A series of protective reflexes 
organized by technique immediately intervene.
To summarize: the suppression of the critical faculty, the forma­
tion of a good social conscience, and the creation of a sphere of 
the sacred are all aspects of a single manifestation, the first and 
clearest consequence of the application of psychoanalytic mass 
techniques. Incidentally, our analysis confirms a social phenome­
non frequently analyzed by modern sociologists: the “creation of 
the masses.” These three elements add a new dimension to the 
masses; the masses thereby gain an internal cohesion they did not 
possess naturally. A unifying psychism has come into being.
A second consequence of the application of propaganda tech­
niques is the creation of a kind of manipulability of the masses. 
Here again Monnerot gives a definition worth repeating. Accord­
ing to Monnerot, propaganda technique “has for its object the 
production and cultivation among the masses of certain predisposi­
tions and a special facility for doing at a given moment whatever 
is strategically opportune. As political circumstances change, it is 
necessary at intervals to cultivate successive predispositions.” This
The TechnologicalSociety (3 7 1
is a remarkable notion; the use of certain propaganda techniques 
is not meant to entail immediate and definitive adhesion to a given 
formula, but rather to bring about a kind of long-range vacuity of 
the individual. The individual, his soul massaged, emptied of his 
natural tendencies, and thoroughly assimilated to the group, is 
ready for anything. Propaganda’s chief requirement is not so much 
to be rational, well grounded, and powerful as it is to produce 
individuals especially open to suggestion who can be easily set into 
motion.
Two categories of propaganda must be distinguished. The first 
strives to create a permanent disposition in its objects and con­
stantly needs to be reinforced. Its goal is to make the masses 
“available,” by working spells upon them and exercising a kind of 
fascination. The second category involves the creation of a sort of 
temporary impulsiveness in its objects. It operates by simple pres­
sure and is often contradictory (since contradictory mass move­
ments are sometimes necessary). Of course, this dissociation can 
be effective only after the propaganda technique has been com­
pletely fused with the popular mores and has become indispen­
sable to the population. This stage may be reached quickly, as, for 
example, in Germany in 1942, after only ten years of psychic ma­
nipulation. The same result seems to have been obtained in the 
Soviet Union, where the masses have been conditioned to the fluc­
tuations of the party line.
A third consequence of technical propaganda manipulations is 
the creation of an abstract universe, representing a complete re­
construction of reality in the minds of its citizens. The new uni­
verse is a verbal universe, to use the excellent phrase of Armand 
Robin, our keenest student of radio propaganda. Men fashion 
images of things, events, and people which may not reflect reality 
but which are truer than reality. These images are based on news 
items which, as is the case in much of the world, are “faked.” 
Their purpose is to form rather than to inform. Faking the news 
is systematically practiced by the Soviet radio, but the procedure is 
found to a lesser degree in all countries. All of us are familiar with 
the "innocent” fraud of the illustrated newspapers in which a photo­
graph is accompanied by an ambiguous caption. A  shipyard, for 
example, is indifferently described as a plant in one of the de­
mocracies, or in die Soviet Union, or wherever. This kind of thing
3 7*) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
represents the first step toward a sham universe. It is also indica­
tive of an important element in today s psychology, the disappear­
ance of reality in a world of hallucinations. Man will be led to act 
from real motives that are scientifically directed and increasingly 
irresistible; he will be brought to sacrifice himself in a real world, 
but for the sake of the verbal universe which has been fashioned 
for him. We must try to grasp the profundity of this upheaval. The 
human being has enormous means at his disposal, and he acts upon 
and in the real world. But he acts in a dream: he seeks other ends 
(those the incantational magic of propaganda proposes for him) 
than those he will really attain. The ends he is expected to reach 
are known only to the manipulators of the mass subconscious, and 
to them alone.
At this point, the reader will protest that our analysis may apply to 
others, but not to him. But if he listens regularly to the radio, reads 
the newspapers, and goes to the movies, the description does fit him. 
He will not be aware of it because the essence of propaganda is to 
act upon the human subconscious but to leave men the illusion of 
complete freedom. The objection will be raised, in another vein, 
that some countries do not exploit these propagandistic manipula­
tory devices; for example, the democracies in general and the 
United States in particular.8  But here certain distinctions must be 
made. Some democracies do not exploit the propaganda arsenal 
simply because they cannot afford to do so. Others, like the United 
States, exploit it only to a limited degree, during certain restricted 
periods (for example, during wars, hot and cold) and only in cer­
tain areas. However, such restraint cannot be imputed to demo­
cratic scruples; these democracies simply do not yet feel the compel­
ling necessity to exploit propagandistic technique. As the present 
global struggle intensifies and world domination by one nation or 
another becomes inevitable, the utilization of propaganda by the 
democracies will also become inevitable. The high priests of effi­
ciency will not recoil before the use of an instrument as efficient as 
propaganda, the more so because it fits the tenor of their culture 
and no longer shocks anyone’s “humanitarian” sentiments. When 
once the masses have become inured to the practices of propa­
ganda techniques, it is impossible to turn back.
.* Ellul: Propaganda* (1962).
The Technological Society (3 7 3
Propaganda activity entails two further consequences of a socio­
logical nature. Because these are obvious, they may be briefly 
summarized. First, as we have already seen in our treatment of the 
techniques of work, there is the psychological factor, which mani­
fests itself in the arrested spiritual development of the worker. 
Friedmann believes that the worker would not experience this 
arrest in a congenial environment, that is, in a favorable economic 
system. He has in mind a socialist regime, which he contends 
would be the most,propitious working environment. In such an 
environment the worker, working without constraints, could ma­
ture. But it is clear that socialist manipulation of unconscious tend­
encies by means of propaganda produces the same results as a real 
modification of conditions. For example, in the social movement 
in the Soviet Union, which concentrates on productivity, it is not 
economic facts that carry the workers along, but socialist propa­
ganda, the creation of a purely verbal universe. Workers react in 
exactly the same way under capitalism if they are sufficiently over­
whelmed by propaganda. This is what happened in the United 
States on a temporary basis during the war years. And there is a 
permanent factor operating in the United States to facilitate the 
application of propaganda technique: the rapidly developing and 
remarkable mechanism of public relations. This technique is a sys­
tem of propaganda applied to all economic and human relations.
A second consequence, in the political sphere, is the devaluation 
•f democracy. I revert here to an idea which we have already con­
sidered but which is difficult to drive home. All of us, more or less, 
take propaganda to be the defense of an idea or system. We hear 
constantly that it cannot therefore be of any harm to the democra­
cies. After all, there are a plurality of political parties employing 
propaganda to maintain opposing or even contradictory ideas; the 
citizen has a free choice among them. Such a misapprehension 
comes from a frighteningly elementary conception of propaganda. 
I have made it quite clear that propaganda is not the defense of an 
idea but the manipulation of the mob’s subconscious. The hope 
reposed in the contradictions of propaganda comes to this: the citi­
zen receives a blow in the face from his neighbor on the right, 
which, fortunately, is compensated for by another blow from his 
neighbor on the left. If propaganda involved calm exposition of 
political theories among which the citizen might choose intelli-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 7 4 )
gently, contradictions would be beneficial and would leave the 
citizen a free man. But this is an impossibility, from the moment 
the propagandist possesses material means for exerting action on 
the mob and knowledge of the secret recesses of the human psy­
che. The man who upholds a political theory presumably believes 
in it. I take the case of a politician who acts from conviction and 
not from personal interest. He will indeed strive to present his 
convictions in the best possible light and to secure the adherence 
of the greatest number of his fellow citizens. To do this he will of 
course make use of the most efficient means. So, like any totalitar­
ian, he will proceed to rape the mob propagandistically. And rape 
remains rape though it be effected by ten political parties ten times 
in a row. Altering the outward form does not alter the substance. 
Think of the parades, for instance, of Nazi Germany, the somber 
and fanatical rites of “blood and soil.” In the United States, the 
equivalent for the most part revolves about rites involving scantily 
clad girls. It is all a matter of temperament; the psychic aim is the 
same. And it is ruinous to democracy.
In the operation of political parties, the exploitation of technical 
means on a large scale presupposes great financial resources. This 
tends to eliminate all minor parties completely or to reduce them 
to the shadowy role of hangers-on. The more intense the political 
propaganda struggle (and the more costly its execution), the 
greater the tendency to reduce the operation of democracy to the 
opposition between two blocs. A citizen may have an original, 
valid, and true political idea, one which might even have had 
every chance of success with his fellow citizens. But if he does 
not possess the millions necessary to elaborate it the length and 
breadth of the country, it counts for nothing. The American democ­
racy is no longer in its youth, when propaganda consisted of one 
man speaking directly to other men.
In the devaluation of democracy, the influences of the propa­
ganda technique work on men as well as parties. The individual, 
forced to submit to contradictory streams of propaganda, not only 
is incapable of preserving freedom of choice, of choosing between 
different doctrines, but is eliminated from the political operation 
completely. He literally no longer exists— and this comes about in 
proportion to the contradictoriness of the propaganda. He is inte- 
gratedinto a sociological group and votes as the group votes.
The Technological Society (3 7 5
We come here to an important conclusion: to the degree that 
propaganda is a technique, it has its own personal identity and 
specificity. But it acts toward an unalterably fixed end. It is mere 
vanity to wish to distinguish a technique as good or bad according 
to its end. Whether technique acts to die advantage of a dictator or 
of a democracy, it makes use of the same weapons, acts on the in­
dividual and manipulates his subconscious in identical ways, and 
in the end leads to the formation of exactly the same type of hu­
man being. Whether 99 per cent of the citizens cast their ballot for 
a dictator or for the various parties in a democracy, whether or not 
the political structures of the different regimes formally differ, the 
well-kneaded citizen, upon whom both regimes ultimately depend, 
becomes through the operation of technique progressively indis­
tinguishable in either. The problem is not merely political; we have 
come upon it in every area of life. But we must distinguish be­
tween two planes here: formal opinion and personal decision. 
Through propaganda, we can train a man not to kill or not to 
drink alcohol; or we can train him to kill or to smoke opium. The 
objective result is different in either case. Sociologically, there is 
admittedly a world of difference between dictatorship and democ­
racy. But in both the moral problem is suppressed; the individual 
is simply an animal broken in to obey certain conditioned reflexes. 
Indeed, there may be a difference between dictatorship and de­
mocracy on the plane of public health or statistics; but on the moral 
plane there is a fundamental identity when democracy achieves 
its ends through propaganda. The human effects of technique are 
independent of the ideological end to which they are applied. 
Amusement. The techniques of amusement and diversion are dif­
ferent from the other human techniques we have considered. Ma­
terially, these techniques are identical with those of propaganda: 
films, radio, newspapers, and, to a lesser degree, books and phono­
graph records. But the hierarchy of these means is not the same. For 
example, the cinema has first place and plays a more important 
role than the radio. By comparison, in the propaganda hierarchy 
radio is the instrument of choice.
Here too we find the exploitation of techniques of the subcon­
scious, but they are exerted with much less pressure. Moreover, 
the range and sphere of these subconscious techniques is different 
Amusement seeks to distract, propaganda to lead. The principal
HUMAN TECHNIQUES37 «)
difference, however, relates to spontaneity. Propaganda technique 
is calculated and deliberate, whereas amusement technique is 
spontaneous and nondeliberate. The former is the result of the 
organizer's decision; the latter, of the mob’s need.
Consider the average man as he comes home from his job. Very 
likely he has spent the day in a completely hygienic environment, 
and everything has been done to balance his environment and 
lessen his fatigue. However, he has had to work without stopping 
and under constant pressure; nervous fatigue has replaced muscu­
lar fatigue. When he leaves his job, his joy in finishing his stint is 
mixed with dissatisfaction with a work as fruitless as it is incompre­
hensible and as far from really productive work. At home he “finds 
himself” again. But what does he find? He finds a phantom. If he 
ever thinks, his reflections terrify him. Personal destiny is fulfilled 
only by death; but reflection tells him that for him there has not 
been anything between his adolescent adventures and his death, 
no point at which he himself ever made a decision or initiated a 
change. Changes are the exclusive prerogative of organized tech­
nical society, which one day may have decked him out in khaki to 
defend it, and on another in stripes because he had sabotaged or 
betrayed it  There was no difference from one day to the next. Yet 
life was never serene, for newspapers and news reports beset him 
at the end of the day and forced on him the image of an insecure 
world. If it was not hot or cold war, there were all sorts of acci­
dents to drive home to him the precariousness of his life. Tom be­
tween this precariousness and the absolute, unalterable determi­
nateness of work, he has no place, belongs nowhere. Whether 
something happens to him, or nothing happens, he is in neither 
case the author of his destiny.
Hie man of the technical society does not want to encounter his 
phantom. He resents being tom between the extremes of accident 
and technical absolutism. He dreads the knowledge that every­
thing ends “six feet under.” He could accept the six-feet-under of 
his life if, and only if, life had some meaning and he could choose, 
say, to die. But when nothing makes sense, when nothing is the 
result of free choice, the final six-feet-under is an abominable in­
justice. Technical civilization has made a great error in not sup­
pressing death, the only human reality still intact
Man is still capable of lucid moments about the future. Propa-
The Technological Society (377
ganda techniques have not been able wholly to convince him that 
life has any meaning left. But amusement techniques have jumped 
into the breach and taught him at least how to flee the presence of 
death. He no longer needs faith or some difficult asceticism to 
deaden himself to his condition. The movies and television lead 
him straight into an artificial paradise. Rather than face his own 
phantom, he seeks film phantoms into which he can project him­
self and which permit him to live as he might have willed. For an 
hour or two he can cease to be himself, as his personality dissolves 
and fades into the anonymous mass of spectators. The film makes 
him laugh, cry, wonder, and love. He goes to bed with the lead­
ing lady, kills the villain, and masters life’s absurdities. In short, he 
becomes a hero. Life suddenly has meaning.
The theater presupposed an intellectual mechanism and left the 
spectator in some sense intact and capable of judgment. The mo­
tion picture by means of its “reality” integrates the spectator so 
completely that an uncommon spiritual force or psychological ed­
ucation is necessary to resist its pressures. In any case, people go to 
the movies to escape and consequently yield to its pressures. They 
find forgetfulness, and in forgetfulness the honied freedom they do 
not find in their work or at home. They live on the screen a life they 
will never live in fact.
It will be said that dreams and hope have been the traditional 
means of escape in times of famine and persecution. But today 
there is no hope, and the dream is no longer the personal act of an 
individual who freely chooses to flee some “reality” or other. It is a 
mass phenomenon of millions of men who desire to help them­
selves to a slice of life, freedom, and immortality. Separated from 
his essence, like a snail deprived of its shell, man is only a blob of 
plastic matter modeled after the moving images.
There is a vast difference between the dreams and hopes of the 
past and those of the present. Formerly, with the conviction that 
“things would change," hope was a beacon illuminating the future. 
Dreams represented flight, but flight into one’s own self. In motion 
pictures, however, the future is not involved. On the strip of film, 
what ought to change has already changed. And the flight of cine­
matic dreams has nothing to do with the inner life; it concerns mere 
externals. When people leave the movie theater, they are full of the 
possibilities they experienced in the shadows; they have received
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 78 )
their dose of the inner life. Their problems too have undergone a 
transformation. They are now problems posed by the film. And they 
have the blissful, if contradictory, impression that these cinematic 
problems, which occupy the whole field of their consciousness, are 
both strong enough to put all vexations to flight and unreal enough 
not to be troublesome. The modem passion for motion pictures is 
completely explained by the will to escape. Just as the tempo of 
work or the authority of the state presupposes spiritual adhesion 
and hence propaganda, so the human condition under the regime 
of technique supposes the escapism which diversional techniques 
offer. One cannot but marvel at an organization which provides the 
antidote as it distills the poison.
Man, emptied by the technical mechanism of all personal inter­
ests, sometimes finds himself at home. What shall he talk about? 
Man has always had one unfailing subject of conversation, life’s 
vexations. Not fear, nor anguish, despair, or passion. All that has 
always been suppressed in his subconscious. But he has always 
been able to talk companionably about vexatious things, hail on 
his vines, mildew, machinery out of order, a troublesome prostate, 
and so forth. Now technique intervenes, repairs everything, and 
creates a world in which everything works well, or well enough. 
Even if some petty vexations persist, the individual feels no need 
to speak of them and turns toward the efficient silence-fillers, tele­
vision and radio, prodigiously useful refuges for those who find that 
family life has become impossible. Jean Laloup and Jean Nelis 
evince a curious optimism when they write that radio and televi­
sion have reconstituted the family. Television doubtless facilitates 
material reunion. Because of it the children no longer go out in the 
evenings. The members of the family are indeed all present materi­
ally, but centered on the television set, they are unaware of one 
another. If they cannot stand or understand one another, if they 
have nothing to say, radio and television make this easy to bear by 1  
re-establishing external relations and avoiding friction. Thanks to 
these technical devices, it is no longer necessary for the members 
of a family to have anything at all to do with one another or even to 
be conscious of the fact that family relations are impossible. It is no 
longer necessary to make decisions. It is possible for a married 
couple to live together a long time without ever meeting each 
other in the resonant emptiness of television. This too is a curious
The Technological Society (3 7 9
means of escape, of hiding from others instead of from oneself. It is 
the modem mask man puts on every evening, which unfortunately, 
lacks the virtues of the ancient mask, demoniac and divine.
One of the best studies of the problem of the radio, that of Roger 
Veille, reminds us that the ear is the great “fault” in man. Through 
it he perceives the “silence of the infinite spaces”; it is the point of 
origin of his great disturbance. The ear, unlike the eye, evokes mys­
tery and renunciation; it is the center of anguish and anxiety. And 
radio fills this opening, protecting man against the silence and the 
mystery by amusing him. The program makers know all this and 
create their programs as a function of this escapism, not for motives 
of crass commercialism or Machiavellianism (as some people seem 
to think), but because they themselves partake of the human con­
dition and seek protection against its anguish. It follows, then, that 
the radio makes a clean break between everyday social reality and 
the dreams and narcotics which its duty is to dispense. To use the 
words of Veille, it must be one of the “liberating distractions.” It 
must deliver the individual from objective constraints. It is a pub­
lic utility dealing in moral comfort, charged with offsetting the 
tragedies of family living, social pressures, and the vexations of 
modem life The radio must compensate for the inhumanities cf 
life in todays cities. In a milieu in which the human being is un­
able to make true friendships or to have profound experiences, the 
radio must furnish him with the appearances of reality, acquaint­
ance, and human proximity; it must captivate and reassure him. 
But Veille rightly inquires whether “the radio may not gradually 
habituate to mere auditory images those to whom it gives the illu­
sion of belonging; and, what is worse, condition them to the ab­
sence of interlocutors.” Unfortunately, the answer to Veilles 
question is clear. There is no other comparable instrument of hu­
man isolation. The radio, and television even more than the radio, 
shuts up the individual in an echoing mechanical universe in which 
he is alone He already knew little enough about his neighbors, and 
now the separation between him and his fellows is further 
widened. Men become accustomed to listening to machines and 
talking to machines, as, for example, with telephones and dicta­
phones. No more face-to-face encounters, no more dialogue. In a 
perpetual monologue by means of which he escapes the anguish of 
silence and the inconvenience of neighbors, man finds refuge in
HUMAN TECHNIQUES380)
the lap of technique, which envelops him in solitude and at the 
same time reassures him with all its hoaxes. Television, because 
of its power of fascination and its capacity of visual and auditory 
penetration, is probably the technical instrument which is most 
destructive of personality and of human relations. What man seeks 
is evidently an absolute distraction, a total obliviousness of him­
self and his problems, and the simultaneous fusion of his con­
sciousness with an omnipresent technical diversion.
In diversion we are at a stage of development in which technique 
answers the needs of men in a technical society, but a society in 
which they are still free to use or not to use the available technical 
means. ‘‘If you wish to escape,” says technique, “you are welcome 
to try.” Modern men, however, are beginning to be aware of their 
need at all costs not to challenge the technical situation, and to 
recognize that technical means exist to meet this need. Take, for 
example, the extraordinary success of Butlin’s vacation camps in 
Great Britain. Butlin grasped the fact that in a world at once exact­
ing and depersonalizing in the extreme, the vacation most men 
prefer must be a genuine vacuum, an ever greater depersonaliza­
tion which gives the impression of freedom but which never allows 
the individual to come face to face with himself, even materially. 
To achieve this end, Butlin in 1938 organized his “family vacation 
camps.” The vacationer lives in a crowd on a strict timetable judi­
ciously arranged so that each day will be different, giving the 
impression of constant novelty and variety. Games, songs, theater, 
eating, “fun” succeed one another at a rapid tempo from seven 
o’clock in the morning until midnight. "The important thing,” says 
Butlin, “is that no one is ever left to himself even for a moment.” 
Everything takes place in a spirit of gaiety and liveliness and under 
the direction of game leaders who are “specialists.” All available 
means are employed to persuade the individual that he is happy. 
Since each camp can accommodate four thousand persons, there is 
little difficulty in arranging for the vacationer to pass his holiday, 
which lasts a fortnight, among a crowd of people. The whole thing 
represents an elaborate and rigorous enterprise for becoming un­
conscious, carried out by a technique described in detail by Butlin 
himself. Butlin minces no words. The problem, as he sees it, is to 
make his customers systematically lose consciousness, not as be­
fore from .political motives, but from motives of pure entertain-
The Technological Society (381
ment. Here is technique put to the service of a kind of Pascalian 
distraction. Not exactly the same kind, since it is not so much a 
matter of dodging the dilemma of man facing eternity as of dodg­
ing the conflict between man and his situation in this life; of for­
getting to meditate not so much on the two infinitives (something 
most men are incapable of) as on the obvious crashing absurdity 
of life in a technical world. The average man is inevitably con­
scious of this. He must therefore becloud his consciousness at any 
cost, and in this, it seems, he is in essential accord with the needs 
of a technical society. Our thesis is verified by the prodigious suc­
cess of Butlin’s camps, a success which is perhaps the most aston­
ishing thing about them. In 1947, four hundred thousand persons 
vacationed in them, and the number has been growing steadily. 
And bear in mind that these figures represent Englishmen, who by 
their very nature would seem the most hostile to this kind of thing.
This demonstrates the complete adaptation of technical amuse­
ments to technical society and to their sociological function. How 
illusory is the effort to make of the motion pictures an educative 
art and a means of instruction! Art films and films with philosophic 
or political intent simply do not correspond to the wishes of the 
movie-going public. It can, of course, be legitimately maintained 
that motion pictures are nonetheless a means of "educating’*  the 
public. But here we must guard against a certain confusion; educa­
tion of the spectator’s taste and understanding takes place, but 
only incidentally. The clouding of his consciousness is paramount, 
and art and science can contribute to this end. The film can suc­
ceed only if it puts art to the service of a sociologically necessary 
and technically possible enterprise; only if art (and indoctrination 
disguised as science) becomes the new means of wrenching men 
from reality. If this were not the case, the public would not have 
patronized films like the first ones of Orson Welles.
Spontaneous or organized mechanisms of entertainment such as 
I have described are useful only to the degree that propaganda 
technique is undeveloped. Propaganda, as it develops, tends to 
assimilate amusement, which either makes its appearance as an 
efficient propaganda medium or, at a later stage, is exploited for 
purposes of human adaptation.
This last makes it impossible to agree with Veilles suggestion 
that the Swedish or Russian radio is not concerned with “distrac-
HUMAN TECHNIQUES3 $ * )
tions,” with building up a social structure of lies and soporifics, be­
cause the citizens of these states have been “set free" and no 
longer “feel the wearisome continuity of daily obligations.” Veille, 
it may be noted, tends implicitly to see in this fact one of the benefi­
cial effects of socialism. In reality, the condition he describes is 
due to the fact that the Swedes are the most "integrated” and 
adapted of all mankind. They have alienated themselves to the 
greatest possible degree in the organization, so that they are no 
longer conscious of any cleavage between personality and tech­
nique, and do not therefore need an artificial paradise. In the case 
of the Russians, propaganda has cleverly absorbed and replaced 
amusement. The Russian citizen subjected to his government’s daily 
propaganda (the most highly developed in the world) is unaware 
of anxiety. But, then, the same was true of Hitler’s Germany.
Sport. There is one last sphere where man can still frolic, but there 
too technique has stopped up all the gaps. I am referring to sport.
Sport has been conditioned by the organization of the great 
cities; apart from city life, its very invention is inconceivable. Coun­
try “sport” is but a pale imitation of city sport and has none of the 
characteristics of what we know as sport.
The sporting vocabulary is English; it was introduced to the con­
tinent when the continental nations came under the influence of 
English industrialization. After the industrial center of gravity 
passed to the United States, American sporting forms prevailed. 
The Soviet Union began to cultivate sport when it began to indus­
trialize; the only country in central Europe which had organized 
sport, Czechoslovakia, was the only one which was industrialized.
Sport is tied to industry because it represents a reaction against 
industrial life. In fact, the best athletes come from working-class 
environments. Peasants, woodsmen, and the like, may be more vig­
orous than the proletariat, but they are not as good athletes. In 
part, the reason for this is that machine work develops the mus­
culature necessary for sport, which is very different from peasant 
musculature. Machine work also develops the speed and precision 
of actions and reflexes.
Moreover, sport is linked with the technical world because sport 
itself is a technique. The enormous contrast between the athletes 
of Greece and those of Rome is well known. For the Greeks, physi­
cal exercise was an ethic for developing freely and harmoniously
The Technological Society (3 8 3
the form and strength of the human body. For the Romans, it was a 
technique for increasing the legionnaire’s efficiency. The Roman 
conception prevails today. Everyone knows the difference be­
tween a fisherman, a sailor, a swimmer, a cyclist, and people who 
fish, sail, swim, and cycle for sport. The last are technicians; as Jun- 
ger says, they “tend to carry to perfection the mechanical side of 
their activity." This mechanization of actions is accompanied 
by the mechanization of sporting goods— stop watches, starting 
machines, and so on. In this exact measurement of time, in this 
precision training of muscular actions, and in the principle of the 
“record," we find repeated in sport one of the essential elements of 
industrial life.
Here too the human being becomes a kind of machine, and his 
machine-controlled activity becomes a technique. This technical 
civilization profits by this mechanization: the individual, by 
means of the discipline imposed on him by sport, not only plays 
and finds relaxation from the various compulsions to which he is 
subjected, but without knowing it trains himself for new compul­
sions. A familiar process is repeated: real play and enjoyment, con­
tact with air and water, improvisation and spontaneity all disap­
pear. These values are lost to the pursuit of efficiency, records, and 
strict rules. Training in sports makes of the individual an efficient 
piece of apparatus which is henceforth unacquainted with any­
thing but the harsh joy of exploiting his body and winning.
The most important thing, however, is not the education of a few 
specialists, but the extension of the sporting mentality to the 
masses. Insofar as this represents a vigorous reaction to the mere 
passivity of spectator sports, it is good. But the usual result is the 
integration of more and more innocents into an insidious tech­
nique.
It is needless to speak of the totalitarian frame of mind for which 
the exercise of sports paves the way. We constantly hear that the 
vital thing is “team spirit,” and so on. It is worth noting that tech- 
nicized sport was first developed in the United States, the most 
conformist of all countries, and that it was then developed as a mat­
ter of course by the dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi, and Communist, 
to the point that it became an indispensable constituent element 
of totalitarian regimes.
Sport is an essential factor in the creation of the mass man. It is,
HUMAN TECHNIQUES.3 8 4 }
at the time, a disciplinary factor, and this in a twofold way. It coin­
cides exactly with totalitarian and with technical culture. In the 
“new” countries, an interpenetration of technique and the practice 
of sport is to be observed. The authoritarian states understand and 
exploit fully the efficiency of technicized sport in making their citi­
zens into conformists and mass men. It is one of the chief boasts of 
Communist states that they fabricate champions in countries 
which hitherto had never heard the word sport. This is an effect of 
the totalitarian society, but it also represents one of its modes of 
action. In every conceivable way sport is an extension of the tech­
nical spirit. Its mechanisms reach into the individual’s innermost 
life, working a transformation of his body and its motions as a func­
tion of technique and not as a function of some traditional end 
foreign to technique, as, for example, harmony, joy, or the realiza­
tion of a spiritual good. In sport, as elsewhere, nothing gratuitous 
is allowed to exist; everything must be useful and must come up to 
technical expectations.
Sport carries on without deviation the mechanical tradition of 
furnishing relief and distraction to the worker after he has finished 
his work proper so that he is at no time independent of one tech­
nique or another. In sport the citizen of the technical society finds 
the same spirit, criteria, morality, actions, and objectives— in short, 
all the technical laws and customs— which he encounters in office 
or factory.
Medicine. Technique makes its major contribution in surgery and 
medicine. I will consider these technical forms only briefly, first 
because they are far removed from the area of my own special com­
petence, and second because they are as uncertain as they are fa­
miliar.
How can we classify these techniques? A report published in the 
review Esprit states: “Thanks to our knowledge of psychophysio- 
logical correlations, it is possible to claim that we are in a position 
to modify the human being's interior energetics.” These modifica­
tions may be achieved by the following means: (1) appropriate 
nutritional regimes involving vitamins and the like; (2) suppres­
sion of glandular secretions, as, for example, castration or steriliza­
tion to control antisocial and overaggressive reactions; (3} injec­
tion or grafting of hormones, as, for example, in attempts to 
increase bodily energy, virility, femininity, or the maternal in-
The Tec.hnological Society (385
stinct; (4) prolonged synthetic medication to modify metabolism; 
(S) operative interruption of the nerve paths of intracerebral 
communication ( to which must be added lobotomies and thala­
motomies, both of which involve direct intervention on the brain 
and entail a “lowering of the psychic level” ).
We ought to add to the above the whole pharmacopeia of “police 
drugs,” as certain narcotics have become popularly known. These 
so-called “truth serums,” that do not extract the truth, have a bad 
reputation, and they are still limited to professional medical use. 
Because of this, we must insist that there are extremely few au­
thenticated instances in which sodium pentothal, for example, has 
been employed for other than medical reasons. Even the accounts 
of the celebrated trials in the Soviet Union and its satellites in 
which the defendants accused themselves must be taken with a 
grain of salt. There is nothing to prove conclusively that truth se­
rums were ever used, and there are good technical reasons for 
believing otherwise. In any case, no positive conclusions can be 
based on such evidence as we possess. What is clear is that these 
presumed techniques, as they are represented by the press, evoke 
spectacular public reaction and inquiries. The chief reason for the 
public’s belief in the efficacy of truth serums is probably moral 
indignation and fear brought to a pitch of madness by anti- 
Communism, so that the real state of affairs becomes proportion­
ately harder to analyze scientifically. It is undeniable, however, 
that it is possible to modify the human being effectively, but it is 
still uncertain just how this modification occurs or what can ulti­
mately be expected from such technical intervention. From my 
point of view, these medical techniques of intervention have only 
secondary importance. I would not deny that they represent a 
major intervention; they affect the human being materially and 
modify him in far-reaching ways. Morally, such intervention is cer­
tainly a grave matter, but the problem, after all, is not essentially 
different from that posed by the death penalty.
As for medical technique, what is to be feared and hoped from its 
application? And with what other technical system will this tech­
nique be interrelated? The answer is: solely with the state. And 
this indicates what we have to fear. It is universally understood 
that technical means begin to be dangerous when the state begins 
to exploit them, utilizing them in connection with its arbitrary,
HUMAN TECHNIQUES386)
omnipotent decisions. When the individual undertakes to systema­
tize a number of techniques, he seldom creates a sturdy structure. 
The technical framework of our world is linked together naturally, 
not by arbitrary human decision, and it is this which gives it its 
solidity. The field of application of these medical techniques will 
of necessity be very limited, since they will be applied only to 
persons expressly designated by the state as enemies or undesir­
ables. These techniques can essentially serve only the state’s de­
signs— whether they are to break the spirit of the last remaining 
free men or to eliminate the old or to obtain sensational confessions 
or declarations during a fake trial. And these designs must be 
limited, since in the last analysis the state can have no interest in 
generalizing methods which appear to degrade the human being. 
The state, on the contrary, has need of whole, strong human beings, 
in full moral, intellectual, and physical vigor, who alone can serve 
it best. What the state requires is the technical means for integrat­
ing completely whole beings, and these means are on the point of 
becoming a reality. The technical state will not be a party to the 
deterioration of its material. Only with regard to already useless 
material (because it is refractory or weak) could the technical 
state be driven to use one of these techniques. It is certainly not 
altogether out of the question that the state might employ these 
techniques. But the state has many other means of attaining its 
ends. Since it has at its disposal concentration camps and the death 
s e n te n c e , it would hardly go out of its way to find more compli­
cated means, except perhaps for the sake of occasional propaganda. 
And certainly the population need not become so alarmed about 
what is, after all, only a lesser evil.
Surgical and medical intervention have another defect from the 
state’s point of view. They cannot be generalized, and are as a 
consequence indeterminate except for special cases. Each new 
case requires the state to make a special decision; these techniques 
cannot function with the autonomous regularity of such state or­
gans as the police. Indeed, it is necessary to limit application, be­
cause the general public must be kept in ignorance. The citizens 
are far from ready to accept the use of these techniques, and would 
be easily aroused if they learned of it. The danger of a popular 
reaction, even a momentary one, against the state is too great to 
risk for the limited advantages the state might draw from their use.
The Technological Society (387
It does not seem, therefore, that medical techniques are an im­
portant part of the body of human techniques. It is possible of 
course to envision a time when surgery will be able to modify 
brain structure instead of destroying it and thereby will be able 
to reconstruct a positive personality. But this is still speculative. 
My conviction is that there is little chance of practical applica­
tion here, apart, perhaps, from the purely medical sphere. Surgical 
intervention must be relegated to a relatively distant future. And 
when we consider the remarkable development of psychosociology 
and social psychoanalysis, both of which are presently being ap­
plied on a mass scale, it is clear that with these the state can 
achieve anything it might hope to achieve through surgical modifi­
cation of the human personality. Surgical intervention can only 
produce “consolidating” effects. We might ask whether the game 
is worth the candle, since such intervention, when undertaken by 
the state, confirms all our moral reservations and strictures con­
cerning the state’s contempt for the human personality.
The over-all efficiency of these techniques does not allow us to 
attach any great weight to them. Their real importance, which 
causes some disquiet, is that they are a “red herring.” Since they 
are spectacular, the public pitches upon them fearfully and crys­
tallizes about them its diffuse fear of technique in general. But it 
is relatively easy to prove to the public that in this respect its 
fears are groundless. The public, unable to see the real problem of 
technique because it gravitates unerringly to glaring superficialities 
and wavers between unreasoning fear and false security, never 
penetrates to the heart of the problem of modem society.
Echoes
Techniques, Men, and Man. Here ends the long encirclement of 
men by technique. It is not the result of a plot or plan by any one 
man or any group of men who direct it or apply it or shunt it in 
new directions. The technical phenomenon is impersonal, and in 
following its course we have found that it is directed toward man. 
In investigating its preferred loci, we find man himself. This man 
is not the man in the mirror. Nor is he the man next door or the 
man in the street. Proceeding at its own tempo, technique analyzes
HUMAN TECHNIQUES388)
its objects so that it can reconstitute them; in the case of man, it 
has analyzed him and synthesized a hitherto unknown being.
Technique never works on the man we meet in the street. The 
great scandal of Nazism was its indecency in applying its tech­
niques to Otto Schultz, who had a family name and a given name, 
who practiced his trade and led his life in full view of hundreds 
of his neighbors. He was operated on without anesthesia, dragged 
off under duress to the accompaniment of the lamentations of his 
family. The physicians of Struthof were scandalous because of 
their cynicism and brutality. It was a glaring blunder for the Nazis 
to show such complete contempt for human feelings. We do bet­
ter; we operate painlessly. Even when we use successive opera­
tions to demonstrate the evolutionary processes of the human 
embryo, the procedures are carried out on "volunteers,” and no 
one complains very much. None of our techniques claims that it 
applies to the living.
Because it is first of all scientific, technique obeys the great law 
of specialization; it can be efficient only if it is specialized. In the 
case of human beings, efficiency has a double meaning. It means 
that technique must be applicable without raising storms of pro­
test. And it means that it must not neglect the scientific aspect 
(which is the most important) of this specialization. Techniques 
are designed for application to a relatively limited number of 
cases; as a consequence, general applicability cannot be envisaged. 
Every human technique has its circumscribed sphere of action, and 
none of them covers the whole of man. As we have seen, there are 
psychological techniques, educational techniques, and many oth­
ers. Each of these answers one and only one particular need. If 
one of them is applied, it does indeed encroach on some private 
sphere or other of the individual, but the greatest part remains 
private. There is therefore never any clear reason to protest. This 
relatively impersonal technical operation is a far cry from one 
which would hurl man brutally into a world of concentration 
camps where the most strident, dramatic, overwhelming techniques 
suddenly descend on him.
A further mistake of Nazism was to dress its techniques in a 
demoniac mask designed to inspire terror. Because the use of 
terror is also a technique, the Nazis made it an invariable accom­
paniment of all their other techniques, shocking the rest of the
The Technological Society (38 9
world by useless excess. We do better. We dress technique in the 
aseptic mask of the surgeon. Impassivity is an attribute of the new 
god, as it was an attribute of the old. The true face of modern 
technique is far more like the Deist’s triangle than the grimacing 
mask of Siva.
A single technique and its guarded application to a limited 
sphere is the starting point of dissociation. No technician anywhere 
would say that he is submitting men, collectively or individually, 
to technique. The biogeneticist who experiments on the human 
embryo, or the film director who tries to affect his audience to the 
greatest possible degree, makes no claim that he is working on 
man. The individual is broken into a number of independent frag­
ments, and no two techniques have the same dimensions or depth. 
Nor does any combination of techniques (for example, propaganda 
plus vocational guidance) correspond to any part of the human 
being. The result is that every technique can assert its innocence. 
Where, then, or by whom, is the human individual being attacked? 
Nowhere and by no one. Such is the reply of technique and tech­
nician. They ask indignantly how it can be alleged that the hu­
man being is being attacked through the application of the new 
school of technique. According to them, the charge itself demon­
strates an absence of comprehension and the presence of errone­
ous, not to say malicious, prejudices. And, in fact, every technician 
taken separately can affirm that he is innocent of aggressive de­
signs against the human being. The biologist, working on a living 
embryo with the consent of the mother, is guilty of no assault on 
her life or her honor. Thus, since no technician applies his tech­
nique to the whole man, he can wash his hands of responsibility 
and declare that the human being remains intact.
A larger view of the technician’s operations thus presents a 
totally reassuring and even edifying picture. Every technician 
working on a tiny particle (so tiny it could not be considered a 
man) of living flesh can claim that he is at work in the name of a 
higher being: Man.
Technicians are not very complicated beings. In truth, they are 
as simple as their techniques, which more and more assimilate 
them. The Communists are no doubt right in thinking that all moral 
problems will be resolved when all men have become technicians.
If it is an important part of the work of our “intellectuals” to
HUMAN TECHNIQUES39 ° )
analyze the times and discover all the myths at work in the twen­
tieth century, this task will demonstrate that the myths are deep- 
rooted and widespread. And when they turn their critical faculties 
to the myths of the technicians, they will not need to delve much 
or deeply. The technicians’ myth is simply Man— not you or I, but 
an abstract entity. The technician intones: “We strive for Man’s 
happiness; we seek to create a Man of excellence. We put the 
forces of nature at his disposal in full confidence that he will over­
come the problems of the present,” and so on. Other modem 
myths— for example, the myth of “progress” or of the "proletariat” 
— are immeasurably less real to the technician than the myth of the 
abstract entity Man, in which he finds his justification. This myth, 
moreover, represents a stage he cannot transcend, for he has small 
ideology and less philosophy. He understands his methods, which 
he applies with satisfaction because they yield immediate results. 
The technician anticipates results, but, be it said, they are not 
genuine ends but merely results. And then he makes the great 
leap into the unknown and finds the explanation of everything and 
the answer to all possible objections: the myth of Man. The tech­
nician either does not believe in the myth at all or believes in it 
only superficially. It respresents for him a ready-made and com­
fortable conviction, a ready answer to all criticism. It is a justifica­
tion, but scarcely a conscious one. Why indeed should the techni­
cian justify himself? He feels in no way guilty; his good intentions 
are as clear as their excellent results are undeniable. No. the tech­
nician has no need of justification. And if ever the slightest doubt 
were to penetrate his consciousness, his answer would be as clear 
as it would be staggering: The Man for whom I am working is 
Humanity, the Species, the Proletariat, the Race, Man the crea­
ture, Man the eternal, even You. All technical systems, whether 
they be expressed in Communist or Liberal phraseology, come 
back in the final analysis to this abstraction. All technicians, too. 
The technicians, in any case, do not have sufficient intellectual 
curiosity to ask themselves what their favorite abstraction really 
means or what the relation is between this abstraction and tech­
nique. Not, one supposes, that intellectual curiosity would be worth 
much here. The abstraction, Man, is only an epiphenomenon in 
the Marxist sense; a natural secretion of technical progress.
Why then become agitated? We have, on the one hand, various
The Technological Society (391
techniques, each of which exerts only partial action and can there­
fore be of no danger to man’s total being. On the other hand, we 
have a myth, “Man," which more or less deifies him and in any 
case strongly affirms that technique is subordinate to the human 
being. What more could we want?
However, one important fact has escaped the notice of the tech­
nicians, the phenomenon of technical convergence. Monnerot has 
defined political totalitarianism as a convergence of a plurality of 
national histories with a plurality of political systems. Our interest 
here is the convergence on man of a plurality, not of techniques, 
but of systems or complexes of techniques. The result is an opera­
tional totalitarianism; no longer is any part of man free and in­
dependent of these techniques. This convergence might be likened 
to the convergence of theater projectors, each of which has a spe­
cific color, intensity, and direction, but each of which can fulfill 
its individual function only in conjunction with the others. The 
effect cannot be predicted on the basis of the individual projectors, 
only on the basis of the object illuminated. Such is the case with 
human techniques. A plurality of them converge toward the hu­
man being, and each individual technician can assert in good 
faith that his technique leaves intact the integrity of its object. But 
the technician’s opinion is of no importance, for the problem con­
cerns not his technique, but the convergence of all techniques. It 
is impossible to determine, by considering any human technique in 
isolation, whether its human object remains intact or not. The 
problem can be solved only by using the human being as a cri­
terion, only by looking at this point of convergence of technical 
systems. This is why I have had to make a preliminary enumeration 
of the various technical complexes which have been applied to 
maa
Now, two additional remarks are in order. First, as I have said 
repeatedly, technical convergence is not brought about by the will 
of any technician or any group of technicians. No technician acts 
as conductor of the technical orchestra. Convergence is a com­
pletely spontaneous phenomenon, representing a normal stage in 
the evolution of technique. The technicians are not conscious of 
the mechanism and even sometimes do not approve of it. Some in­
tellectuals have a dim awareness of the fact of convergence and 
recognize, generally optimistically, that the technical movement
HUMAN TECHNIQUES39 * )
Is directed to the whole man. Some technicians are indeed seeking 
gropingly to unify a number of different techniques. Cybernetics 
and psychosomatic medicine are good examples of this, and con­
firm, incidentally, the phenomenon of technical convergence. At 
the midpoint of the twentieth century we begin to become con­
scious of the phenomenon.
It is difficult to exploit the techniques that already exist precisely 
because of the fact of technical specialization. Our highly special­
ized technicians will have a vast number of problems to hurdle 
before they are in a position to put together the pieces of the puz­
zle. The technical operations involved do not appear to fit well 
together, and only by means of a new technique of organization 
will it be possible to unite the different pieces into a whole. When 
this has finally been accomplished, however, human techniques 
will develop very fast. As yet unrecognized potentialities for in­
fluencing the individual will appear. At the moment such possi­
bilities are only dimly discerned in the penumbra of totalitarian 
regimes still in their infancy. It should not be forgotten, of course, 
that, while our technicians are trying to synthesize the various 
techniques theoretically, a synthetic unity already exists de facto, 
and man is its object.
Our second remark concerns certain judgments we might be 
tempted to make. In discussing the effects of technique on man, 
we must avoid overhasty or superficial generalizations. We must 
not become too agitated or hold that man’s nature is cut into bits 
and pieces. We must be wary of using a mystical vocabulary. We 
do not understand very well what man is, and nothing we know 
would justify us in declaring his character sacred or some part of 
it inalienable and purely personal or in asserting that he has su­
preme value. The values may be there, but they elude us as soon 
as we try to define them or to make precise their nature and loca­
tion. Is this supreme value under attack? When we behold the 
individual, trapped in technical mechanisms, we are indeed 
tempted to reply in the affirmative. But if we analyze the situation 
concretely, we cannot discover the locus of the attack or even 
what is being attacked.
For this, another system of references is needed, a conception 
of man which is a priori and nonscientific. But then we must not 
be surprised at the divergent reactions we get when we speak of
The Technological Society (393
the impact of techniques upon the human being. On the other 
hand, we must not say that the question is unimportant. It would 
be deceptive to ask, “Whfat then is under attack?” and to enumerate 
analytically the components of the human psyche, as determined 
by the most up-to-date methods, in order to show that nothing 
humanly valuable is endangered by the progress of technique. For 
we never know whether there is not something in man which our 
analyses and scientific apparatus are unable to grasp. All of us, 
even the materialists, are sure that there is. For it is on the un­
moving and unseen axis, which is the essence of the wheel and 
round which it turns, that all else depends.
But we cannot declare that it is unimportant if technique per­
meates everything human so long as it does not reach the unreach­
able center. This dualism is impossible because this “center” is not 
abstract but concretely embodied. If the quality of being human 
depends on it, and if this quality is modified by the ways in which 
technique mauls man’s body and soul, we have no right to say 
that what is essential remains unscathed. There is, on the contrary, 
every evidence that what is called the “person” is being danger­
ously impaired. Similarly, it is escapism to say that what can be 
laid hold of in man is itself the result of many influences, many 
social currents and collective habits, so why worry about the in­
fluence of technique?
I do not believe there are many proponents left of the idea that 
man is something in himself, that he has an essence independent 
of his milieu. But there is a broad middle ground between the in­
difference to technique affected by the philosophical dualists who 
would maintain such a position and the indifference that the techni­
cal sycophants affect. Two reservations suffice. First, the fact that 
the individual is subject to a given influence is no reason to make 
him submit to another. Second, there is a difference between the 
spontaneous and lightly coercive influence of an individualistic 
social group and the calculated, precise, and efficient influence of 
techniques.
But here we are at the mercy of religious and scientific prejudices, 
which give rise to banal and superficial statements. In discussing 
the human effects of technique, I have made every effort to avoid 
passing favorable or unfavorable judgments and to shun journal­
istic commonplaces. My purpose is to inquire not so much into the
3 9 4 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
modifications of the human being that are being made as into the 
symptoms of the technical encroachment which is now more or 
less complete.
Let us not forget that every one of the human techniques is re­
lated to all other techniques. We must be on guard against at­
tempting to isolate them. When we say that human techniques 
must compensate for the disagreeable consequences of other tech­
niques, we are arbitrarily isolating different technical spheres. Hu­
man techniques are closely dependent on economic, political, and 
mechanical techniques, not only because of their origin and po­
tentialities, but even more because of the necessity for their ap­
plication. Economics and mechanics form a framework, a milieu, 
within which human techniques necessarily belong. Suppressing 
the context no doubt makes it easy to analyze these techniques and 
to draw reassuring conclusions. But the conclusions are also com­
pletely unreliable. Human techniques have no existence except to 
the degree that the human individual is subject to economic condi­
tions and to the degree that mechanical conditions permit the 
means discovered to be exercised upon him. To neglect the tech­
nical context of these human techniques is to live in a world of 
dreams. To admit it is to perceive that human techniques in the 
real world (not in the world of philosophic abstractions where 
freedom is always possible) are conditioned by the economic, the 
political, and the mechanical. Human techniques, therefore, are 
never “dominants” because they can exist only in relation to all the 
others. They cannot be isolated in a pure state; and their means, 
tendencies, and results must be interpreted in relation to these 
others. If human techniques were ever to come into conflict with 
the others, they would inevitably lose out, for they would retain no 
real substance. To the degree that they might conceivably run 
counter to the necessities, for example, of economic productivity, 
they would ruin the condition sine qua non of their application. 
Without unremitting productivity, the men, money, and time nec­
essary to their application would not be forthcoming. Human 
techniques, therefore, are obliged to become a part of the techni­
cal system; the reassuring conclusions drawn by some writers seem 
correspondingly less convincing.
The explicit problem then seems to be; If we can perceive certain
The Technological Society (395
echoes of techniques in man, how do these echoes enable us to 
measure the degree of human technical encirclement? 
Vhomme-machineA progressively more complete technical 
knowledge of man is being developed. Will it liberate him? Man’s 
traditional, spontaneous activities are now subjected to analysis in 
all their aspects— objects, modes, durations, quantities, results. The 
totality of these actions and feelings is then systematized, sche­
matized, and tabulated. A human type is created which is the only 
recognizable “normal” As Sargent puts it “Technique will furnish 
me with norms of life in whatever concerns work, food, housing, 
education, and so on.”
It is to be understood, of course, that there is no absolute obliga­
tion for the individual to conform to the type. He can, if he will, 
despise it. But then he will always find himself in an inferior posi­
tion, vis-a-vis the type, whenever the two come into competition. 
Our human techniques must therefore result in the complete con­
ditioning of human behavior. They must assimilate man into the 
complex “man-machine,” the formula of the future.
In the coupling of man and machine, a genuinely new entity 
comes into being. Most writers still insist on the modem tendency, 
which they profess to discern, to adapt the machine to the man. 
Such adaptation doubtless exists and represents a great improve­
ment; but it entails its counterpart, the complete adaptation of the 
man to the machine. This last does not lie in a remote future. Man’s 
nature has already been modified; and it is to an already adapted 
individual that technique adapts mechanical apparatus. Such 
adaptation is becoming progressively easier, and even takes place 
spontaneously when the human techniques co-operate.
A familiar case in point is the “fixation” of workers in their work. 
Polls reveal that when a worker begins work on an assembly line, 
he frequently experiences a certain malaise. He is simply not cut 
out for such work, and assembly-line workers are often tempted to 
abandon it or to request transfers. They become jittery and nerv­
ous, and evidence a profound uneasiness. But to make a living 
and to avoid the ever threatening unemployment, they must hold
* Literally, "Man: a machine," A famous French phrase and the title of Julien 
Offroy de la Mettrwfs celebrated work (1748) which argues the materialistic 
thesis that the soul, like the muscles, is the result of metabolism. (Trans.)
396)  HUMAN TECHNIQUES
on to their jobs. They must force themselves to adjust to working 
conditions as they find them. They are "fixed.” When they are 
questioned, they claim to be satisfied and disclaim any desire for 
change; the very idea of change, in fact, can call forth real fear. 
The results of such polls are taken to indicate that the working 
man is happy. But a completely different interpretation is pos­
sible: that the constant exercise of impersonal labor has resulted 
in the total depersonalization of the laborer. He has been shaped 
by his work, used by it, mechanized, and assimilated. Impartial 
psychological investigations reveal that the workers have been de­
prived of initiative and responsibility; they are "adapted" to the 
degree that they have become inert, unable to take risks in any 
area. Such findings do not, perhaps, apply to all workers, but 
they represent the current tendency. They are, moreover, readily 
understandable. W hy should we demand that workers be super­
men? Workers, like all other men in the technical society, have 
acquired a fear of change, and feel the need of the work that costs 
them so much. Their situation is analogous to that of the man who 
began by reacting to propaganda, progressively abandoned him­
self to it, ended by being manipulated by it, and is no longer 
capable of dispensing with this adjuvant to personality and excit­
ant to thought and feeling.
Until recently it was possible to show that worker adaptation to 
a given machine did not represent excessive specialization in the 
important sense that the specialized worker could be adapted to a 
very great number of different machines. This statement is still 
perhaps true for the period we are passing through today. But the 
more monumental and exacting the machine becomes (and by 
machine T  understand organization, too), the more indissoluble 
the complex man-machine becomes. The difficulty experienced by 
pilots of hypermodem aircraft in changing over to another type of 
machine, or even to another machine of the same type, is well 
known. This last seems a good example of the irreversible condi­
tioning of the individual by technique. The more human factors 
are taken into account in the development of technique, the more 
man himself is a part of the development, not perhaps in a subordi­
nate role, but irreversibly and indissolubly superordinated. But 
such superordination, even if we take it in its most favorable light, 
can scarcely represent human liberation; the human being be-
The Technological Society (397
comes completely incapable of escaping from the technical order 
of things. Man and technique bear the same relation to each other 
as the social superstructure bears to the economic infrastructure 
in the Marxist scheme of things. Technicized man literally no 
longer exists except in relation to the technical infrastructure.
The theory might be advanced that in the man-machine complex 
man in some sense plays the role the soul plays in relation to the 
body in certain philosophies. But the contrary would rather seem 
the case, as J. M. Lahy implied long ago when he asked: "Will not 
this man have less and less time to be conscious of his own living 
presence?” No doubt, man will continue to steer the machine, but 
only at the price of his individuality.
Again the adaptability of man will be raised as an objection to 
my thesis. Why should not man be able to adapt to the technical 
context, since he has in the past adapted to so many new situations 
and to so many different conditions equally representative of pro­
found change? Why should he forfeit his personal life now, after 
he has for so long been able to take new conditions in stride with­
out forfeiting it? Technical adaptation will doubtless produce anew 
human type, but why should this be condemned? My reply to this 
theory (which has enjoyed great vogue in the past few years) is 
that man does indeed possess an extraordinary adaptive capacity, 
but this adaptability has produced very varied results. Some natives 
of Tierra del Fuego have succeeded in adapting to life on Cape 
Horn; but it can hardly be maintained that they represent a very 
desirable human type. I entertain no doubts whatsoever that a 
generalized human adaptability exists, but I am much less certain 
of the excellence of its results in what concerns men in the con­
crete. I must add that I am much more interested in real men 
who actually exist than in that ideal Man which has no existence 
except as an image and an abstraction.
The ideal Man is an escapism which eases every kind of 
enormity with tranquilizing abstractions. We should remember 
what the Nazis did with respect to this ideal in their extermination 
camps (which destroyed some millions of unimportant specimens). 
We ought to avoid the same mistake with respect to this all-virtuous 
ideal in the universal concentration camp we live in. What is im­
portant is not the adaptability of Man, but the adaptability of 
men. We shall find the answer, not in the immortal soul of the
3g8 ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
Species, but in the preservation of our own individual souls, which 
are, perhaps, not immortal.
Our personal adaptability is limited. There are circumstances in 
which men as we know them cannot live at all. They cannot live, 
for example, in concentration camps, even when these exist without 
supplementary tortures. There are conditions in which they can 
indeed continue to exist, but only with the loss of everything which 
makes them peculiarly human. In this connection we have only 
to think of certain tribes terrifyingly close to the animal level (and, 
in some aspects of life, even below it). We need only think of the 
Nazi torture apparatus, or of the degradation experienced by the 
ordinary man in the ranks of the army in wartime. In view of these 
examples, we are entitled to ask what adaptation will really be like 
in the man-machine complex. The psychotechnicians have recog­
nized that adaptation is not possible for everyone. In a completely 
technicized world, there will be whole categories of men who will 
have no place at all, because universal adaptation will be required. 
Those who are adaptable will be so rigorously adapted that no 
play in the complex will be possible. The complete joining of man 
and machine will have the advantage, however, of making the 
adaptation painless. And it will assure the technical efficiency of 
the individuals who survive it.
Up to the present, adaptation has been the product of material 
interaction, with all this implies in laxness, misfitting, and excess. 
But future adaptation will be calculated according to a strict sys­
tem, the so-called “biocracy.” It will be impossible to escape this 
system of adaptation because it will be articulated with so much 
scientific understanding of the human being. The individual will 
have no more need of conscience and virtue; his moral and mental 
furnishings will be a matter of the biocrat’s decisions.
At present we have little conception of what this new man will 
be like. The technician by his existence gives us an inkling, but an 
imperfect one; the technician still retains elements of spontaneity. 
We are, however, able to divine what the new man will gain and 
what he will lose in comparison with the average modem man.
The Dissociation of Man. A  second element, which is of great im­
portance (and is, in a way, the inverse of the last), is the human 
dissociation produced by techniques. The purpose of our human 
techniques is ostensibly to reintegrate and restore the lost unity of
The Technological Society (399
the human being. But the unity produced is the abstract unity of 
the ideal Man; in reality, the concrete application of techniques dis­
sociates man into fragments. We have already considered the dis­
sociation of human intelligence and action characteristic of modem 
methods of work. The same tendency is found in “shift” work. It 
is understood, of course, that in modem work the human being 
accomplishes nothing; at best he performs a neutral function dur­
ing the “dead time” of the working day. He must exercise his 
own personality, if he exercises it at all, during the eight hours of 
leisure.
This tendency gives "good results” in the form of contented 
workers. But in another sense it is exceedingly dangerous. It is im­
possible to make industrial labor interesting by allowing the worker 
to introduce his own personality into it. He must be rendered com­
pletely unconscious and mechanized in such a way that he cannot 
even dream of asserting himself. The technical problem is to make 
his gestures so automatic that they have no personal quality at all.
What we usually say is: “The worker must be freed from con­
tinual preoccupation with the tasks of his vocation.” I can easily 
see the good results of this liberation. But to call good the fact 
that the worker thinks and dreams about matters unrelated to his 
work while his body carries out certain mechanical activities is to 
sanction the psychological dissociation between intelligence and 
action which our technical society tends to produce and which is ' 
possibly the greatest of human scourges. We thereby admit that, 
when all is said and done, the ideal state, higher than conscious­
ness, is a dreaming sleep.
To acquiesce in the thesis that work is “neutral” is to acquiesce 
in this profound rupture. Indeed, the individual cannot be “ab­
sent” from his work without great injury to himself. Work is an 
expression of life. To assert that the individual expresses his per­
sonality and cultivates himself in the course of his leisure (we hive 
already considered what may be expected of mans leisure) is to 
accept the suppression of half the human personality. History com­
pels the judgment that it is in work that human beings develop and 
a£Brm  their personality. Those who set an inordinately high value 
on sports and gambling are without substance. Only see what 
leisure has made of the bourgeois classes of society!
It is possible that the modem organization of industrial society
HUMAN TECHNIQUES400)
has made people "happy.1 *  The dissociation of mental activity from 
physical actions probably results in a lessening of fatigue since 
there is no longer any need to participate or to make decisions. It 
is nonetheless undesirable to sanction this situation or to establish 
it as the norm. To do so is inevitably to weaken the human per­
sonality; it is impossible so to fragment man’s personality without 
weakening it A certain disequilibration may be avoided by these 
means. But the loss of creative power has disastrous psychological 
consequences.-When the human being is no longer responsible for 
his work and no longer figures in it, he feels spiritually outraged. 
The technical organization of the technical society may obviate 
certain tendencies to aggression and frustration (in a non-Freudian 
sense). But the annihilation of work and its compensation with 
leisure resolves the conflicts by referring them to a subhuman 
plane.
It is difficult to understand the hope many modem men repose 
in leisure. Yet this hope is prevalent. It is, for example, the point 
of departure of Christian employers1 who hold that in his leisure 
time the worker can lead a personal life, escape the constraints put 
upon him by society, and regain his psychic equilibrium. This is 
also the attitude of the socialists, who advocate the greatest possible 
reduction of working hours in order that the individual be afforded 
certain possibilities of life and self-development. It is the attitude 
of the technicians of labor, as reported by Friedmann. In com­
menting on certain essays of Leon Walther, Friedmann writes: 
"We must conjure up the prospect of a society in which labor will 
be of restricted duration, industrial operations automatized, and 
piecework, requiring no attention, made pleasant by music and lec­
tures . . .  a society, in short, in which culture will be identified 
completely with leisure. In a leisure more and more full of po­
tentialities, and more and more active, will be found the justifica­
tion of the humanistic experiment.”
Friedmann is asserting here that it is impossible to make indus­
trial labor positive. But if we agree to Friedmann’s proposition 
that the human being can develop his personality only in the 
cultivation of leisure, we are denying that work is an element of

The Technologies Society (401
personality fulfillment, or of satisfaction, or of happiness. This is 
bad enough; but the situation is even more serious when we con­
sider that putting our hopes in leisure is really taking refuge in 
idealism. If leisure were a real vacuum, a break with the forces of 
the environment, and if, moreover, it were spontaneously utilized 
for the education of the personality, the thesis of the value of 
leisure might hold. But neither of these conditions is true.
W e see first of all that leisure, instead of being a vacuum rep­
resenting a break with society, is literally stuffed with technical 
mechanisms of compensation and integration. It is not a vacuous 
interval. It is not a human kind of emptiness in which decisions 
might be matured. Leisure time is a mechanized time and is ex­
ploited by techniques which, although different from those of 
man’s ordinary work, are as invasive, exacting, and leave man no 
more free than labor itself. As to the second condition, it is simply 
not the case that the individual, left on his own, will devote him­
self to the education of his personality or to a spiritual and cultural 
life. We are perpetually falling into this idealism. In fact, modern 
man himself seeks to give a technical form to his leisure time and 
rebels against entering the sphere of human creativity. Since his 
youth, and in his vocational activity, he has been unrelentingly 
“adapted.” If the individual must be regimented into intelligent 
use of his free time, if he is obliged to spend this time learning 
how to be “human,” of what value are vacations and leisure? Where 
in this new framework of propaganda is there room for the tran- 
scendingly important elements of personality formation, choice, 
personal experience, and spontaneous participation in creative ac­
tivity? Who or what is to be his guide in the collective, educative 
employment of leisure? The employer? the administration? the 
labor unions? To put the question at all is to recognize its fatuity. 
What if man’s leisure allowed him to judge his own work? What if, 
in becoming “cultivated” or, even better, “a real person,” he should 
rebel against his stupid, mechanized job? Or find his four hours of 
obligatory servitude an intolerable abasement? It is unimaginable.
W e conclude that the education of the human personality can­
not but conform to the postulates of technical civilization. Man’s 
leisure must reinforce the other elements of this culture so there 
will be no risk of producing poorly adjusted persons. This is the
HUMAN TECHNIQUES4 0 2 )
direction the techniques of amusement have taken. To gamble that 
leisure will enable man to live is to sanction the dissociation I have 
been describing and to cut him off completely from a part of life.
Historically it has always been possible for men to realize them­
selves in their free time. The individual has always found self- 
expression both in work and in leisure; the two exist in a mutual 
relationship and express two consubstantial aspects of the human 
being. It is idealistic to expect leisure to replace the functions of 
both work and leisure or to epitomize and take upon itself the whole 
of life. A minimum condition would be that automatic work, the 
travail neant, be of very limited duration, perhaps three or four 
hours daily. But such a reduction of working hours is still a long 
way off. And even if we could be certain that this would come to 
pass in two or three generations, might not the human being have 
been so transformed by that time that his spontaneous creative 
power would have been irreparably destroyed? It would be utterly 
idealistic to reply in the negative. And it would be twice-com­
pounded idealism to believe that the individual with fourteen 
hours of leisure free of technique and of necessity, would spon­
taneously produce works expressing his personality.
There are people who have hobbies such as gardening or putter­
ing about the house. But what is the proportion of such people to 
those who do nothing? The melancholy fact is that the human 
personality has been almost wholly disassociated and dissolved 
through mechanization.
All this shows once again how illusory it is to pin to one sector of 
technique the hopes which serious analysis denies all of them. We 
must conclude that the organizers of work, who have clearly recog­
nized the nature of modem labor, have failed to recognize the 
nature of leisure. If it is asked whether leisure could be otherwise, 
the answer is that it could. So could the conditions of work. And 
the state and human nature. But if we are going in for all these 
conditionals, paradise could also find a place on earth.
The Triumph of the Unconscious. Flight is always possible. It is, 
indeed, the spontaneously chosen solution (moreover, it represents 
still another aspect of the technical encirclement of the person). If 
there cannot be any real salvation, the individual escapes into il­
lusion and unconsciousness. Modem man (I do not speak of the 
theoreticians) represses his fear of the technical world and intoxi-
The Technological Society (403
cates himself with action, or, better, with the illusion of action. One 
of the most genuine men of our time, Georges Navel, is a living 
witness to (he possibility of true freedom even in a technical world. 
But Navel has had to pay a fearful price for this freedom in effort, 
asceticism, and refusal to compromise. And even Navel is not com­
pletely free of the illusion of action, as shown by his recommenda­
tion of “political participation” as one means of curing the world’s 
malaise.
The individual who engages in party politics, with its program 
of activities, meetings, and fellowship, may well discover in it an 
answer to the problems of disequilibration. Indeed, the more de­
manding the party, the more efficacious the remedy. Communism 
long ago denounced the political activity of the democracies as an 
intolerable hoax and a “flight into unreality.” For them, democratic 
political "action” is completely useless. I will not go into Marx’s 
analysis of democracy, which I hold to be true. But everything 
Marx has to say about democratic political action seems to me to 
hold, feature for feature, for Communist politics as well. The in­
dividual who throws himself into political activity of any coloration 
has the gratifying impression that he is accomplishing something, 
and justification and satisfaction. But the sad truth is that he is 
resolutely by-passing the real problem and repressing it. This kind 
of compensation, which is natural and easily understandable, can 
nonetheless only result in human disintegration and a new techni­
cal alienation. A  detailed consideration of political activity would 
bring us back once more to the same point. Political activity allows 
the human being to exist in the technical milieu, but it is regression 
nonetheless, and a corollary to the general flight into unconscious­
ness.
But this is true of work and, in fact, of all elements of human life. 
All of them, to the extent that they are encircled and repressed by 
technique, tend to pass over the lower threshold of consciousness. 
The unconscious tends, therefore, to play an ever more important 
role in the conduct of human life.
Every technique, and above all every human technique, makes 
a fundamental appeal to the unconscious. At the same time the 
sphere of action of the unconscious is enlarged by means of the 
repressions I have mentioned. It is highly significant that technical 
elements begin to appear in what the psychoanalysts call the
HUMAN TECHNIQUES404)
“great dreams.” The traditional figures of certain typical dreams, 
figures which go back to the remotest human times, are beginning 
to be displaced by technical instruments. Bastide notes the appear­
ance of the automobile in the dreams of certain Indian tribes. The 
important point here is that a technical contrivance has replaced 
traditional symbols; the breakdown of an automobile, it would 
seem, is symbolic of sexual derangement. This mechanical pene­
tration of the unconscious indicates that nothing human is exempt 
from the influence of technique.
In art, technical influence has been marked. Indeed, modern art 
expresses the subconscious precisely to the degree that the sub­
conscious has been influenced by the machine. The artist is in fact 
a seismograph that records the fluctuations of man and society. 
The cubist and abstract schools of art ( as, in poetry, dadaism and 
oneirism) are aspects of this deep reality. With very different 
forms, Chirico, Leger, and Marcel Duchamp, sometimes con­
sciously and sometimes unconsciously, show us the coupling of 
machine and person. They show too the absurdity of the mechani­
cal world, however rational it may be, and the impossibility of an 
aesthetic based on the technical movement unless it is an aesthetic 
of madness. A  major section of modern art and poetry uncon­
sciously guides us in the direction of madness; and, indeed, for the 
modern man there is no other way. Only madness is inaccessible to 
the machine. Every other “art" form can be reduced to technique; 
note the utilitarian art of the Soviets. The artists of our time are the 
most impressive witnesses to the fact that a true aesthetics is an 
impossibility for men whose only alternatives are madness or pure 
technique; and this in spite of the existence of powers of artistic 
invention such as past civilizations have seldom seen.
As long as modern art was concerned with an aesthetic of move­
ment (as opposed to the older aesthetic of form), with the inte­
gration of duration into graphic representation, with the “simul­
taneity” of Miro, Picasso, and Klee, an artistic world capable of 
development was still possible. But although the artist of the 
present can still master and represent the impulse of the machine, 
he is completely overwhelmed and impotent in a world that has a 
place only for a human being who has been stripped of his real self. 
Contemporary art forms bear witness to this impotence.
The Technological Society (4 0 5
We must pay due respect to the honorable struggle being waged 
by those who wish to deliver men from the clutches of technique 
and restore certain possibilities of living to man. If I have criticized 
their research on work and leisure, I did so not because I object to 
their aims but because I distrust their illusions and idealism.
If we take note of the penetration of technique into the un­
conscious, we must also consider the inverse, the exploitation of 
this penetration by other techniques with the purpose of reinforc­
ing it and making it more complete. I have indicated that propa­
ganda is based on the manipulation of the subconscious by 
technical means. So are those hypermodem police methods which 
have as their end the establishment of a “neurotic complex” based 
on feelings of insecurity. Our technical world not only creates these 
feelings spontaneously, it develops them with malice aforethought 
for technical reasons and by technical means which, in their action 
on the human being, reinforce the structures of that technical 
world. “The only person who still remains a private individual is 
he who is asleep,” declared Robert Ley in a noteworthy phrase. 
The words might be taken to refer exclusively to the Nazi regime. 
But they are not limited. They pertain to the integration of all 
men into a brutally technicized environment.
Ley’s aphorism, however, is not altogether exact, for we have 
observed the intrusion of technique even into dreams. This phe­
nomenon has been given a Freudian interpretation in terms of the 
“superego,” which lays hold of the thoughts and feelings of every 
individual. This concept of the superego, which is composed of the 
collective imperative and mass assimilation, brings us to a new 
series of observations centering about the “mass man.”
Mass Man. Modem society is moving toward a mass society, but 
the human being is still not fully adapted to this new form.
The purpose of human techniques is to defend man, and the 
first line of defense is that he be able to live. If these techniques 
strengthen him in his nineteenth-century individualism (itself no 
ideal state of affairs), they only aggravate the split between the 
material structures of society, the social institutions, and the forces 
of production, on the one hand, and man's personal tendencies, on 
the other. This presupposes that technique can in fact defend 
man’s individuality. But such a disruption is technically impossible 
because it would entail insupportable disorders for man. Human
HUMAN TECHNIQUES406)
techniques must therefore act to adapt man to the mass. Moreover, 
these techniques remain at variance with the other material tech­
niques on which they depend. They must contribute to making 
man a mass man and help put an end to what has hitherto been 
considered the normal type of humanity. The type that will emerge 
and the type that will disappear will be the subjects of a forth­
coming work. For the moment, it suffices to establish concretely 
the tendencies of our human techniques to create the mass man.
Material techniques usually result in a collective social form by 
means of a process which is largely involuntary. But it is sometimes 
voluntary; the technician, in agreement with the technical data, 
may consider a collectivity a higher social form. Involuntary and 
voluntary action are both to be observed, for example, in the sphere 
of psychological collectivization. I have indicated (for example, in 
my treatment of leisure) the means by which this involuntary and, 
in a way, automatic adaptation appears. I shall refer to one other 
striking phenomenon of involuntary psychological collectivization; 
advertising.
The primary purpose of advertising technique is the creation of a 
certain way of life. And here it is much less important to convince 
the individual rationally than to implant in him a certain concep­
tion of life. The object offered for sale by the advertiser is naturally 
indispensable to the realization of this way of life. Now, objects 
advertised are all the result of the same technical progress and are 
all of identical type from a cultural point of view. Therefore, ad­
vertisements seeking to prove that these objects are indispensable 
refer to the same conception of the world, man, progress, ideals—  
in short, life. Once again we are confronted by a technical phe­
nomenon completely indifferent to all local and accidental dif­
ferences. Indeed, American. Soviet, and Nazi advertisements are 
in inspiration closely akin; they express the same conception of life, 
despite all superficial differences of doctrine. The Soviet Union, 
after having for a period violently rejected the technical system of 
advertising publicity, has more recently found it indispensable.
Advertising, which is founded on massive psychological research 
that must be effective, can “put across” the technical way of life. 
Any man who buys a given object participates in this way of life 
and, by falling prey to the compulsive power of advertising, enters
The T echnological Society (407
involuntarily and unconsciously into its psychological framework.
One of the great designs of advertising is to create needs; but this 
is possible only if these needs correspond to an ideal of life that 
man accepts. The way of life offered by advertising is all the more 
compelling in that it corresponds to certain easy and simple tend­
encies of man and refers to a world in which there are no spiritual 
values to form and inform life. When men feel and respond to the 
needs advertising creates, they are adhering to its ideal of life. This 
explains the extremely rapid development, for example, of hygiene 
and cocktails. No one, before the advent of advertising, felt the 
need to be clean for cleanliness’ sake. It is clear that the models 
used in advertising (Elsie the Cow, for instance) represent an ideal 
type, and they are convincing in proportion to their ideality. The 
human tendencies upon which advertising like this is based may be 
strikingly simple-minded, but they nonetheless represent pretty 
much the level of our modem life. Advertising offers us the ideal 
we have always wanted (and that ideal is certainly not a heroic 
way of life).
Advertising goes about its task of creating a psychological col­
lectivism by mobilizing certain human tendencies in order to intro­
duce the individual into the world of technique. Advertising also 
carries these tendencies to the ideal, absolute limit It accomplishes 
this by playing down all other human tendencies. Every man is 
concerned, for example, about his bodily health— but show him 
Superman and it becomes his destiny to be Superman. In addition, 
advertising offers man the means for realizing material desires 
which hitherto had the tiresome propensity of not being realized 
In these three ways, psychological collectivism is brought into 
being.
Advertising must affect all people; or at least an overwhelming 
majority. Its goal is to persuade the masses to buy. It is therefore 
necessary to base advertising on general psychological laws, which 
must then be unilaterally developed by it. The inevitable conse­
quence is the creation of the mass man. As advertising of the most 
varied products is concentrated, a new type of human being, pre­
cise and generalized, emerges. We can get a general impression 
of this new human type by studying America, where human beings 
tend clearly to become identified with the ideal of advertising. In
HUMAN TECHNIQUES408)
America advertising enjoys universal popular adherence, and the 
American way of life is fashioned by it
In addition to the involuntary, psychological activity which leads 
to the creation of the mass man, there are certain conscious means 
which can be used to attain the same end. We must not misunder­
stand the qualification conscious in this connection. The degree of 
choice is very small; the process is effectively conditioned by ma­
terial techniques and the beliefs they engender. However, this 
consciously concerted action is geared to psychological collectivi­
zation and, unlike advertising techniques, exerts a direct effect. It 
has a twofold basis and a twofold orientation, and centers about 
the notions of group integration and unanimity, which I shall dis­
cuss in the following section.
Up to now, in discussing human techniques we have considered 
only man’s need for adaptation with a view to his happiness or, at 
least, his equilibrium. This plays a role here too. For example, it 
can be shown that in our society the individual experiences tran­
quility only in a consciously gregarious state. This involves not only 
the indeniable “strength in unity” and “forgetfulness of one’s lot 
in the crowd," but also the conscious recognition of the need to 
apply adequate remedies to social dangers. In our culture, the per­
son who is not consciously adapted to his group cannot put up 
adequate resistance. Lewin’s studies of anti-Semitism, for example, 
indicate that the Zionist groups with their collective psychology 
were able to withstand persecution much more readily than were 
the unorganized Jews who had retained an individualistic men­
tality.
It cannot be denied that this kind of conscious psychological 
adaptation, which gives the individual a chance to survive and 
even be happy, can produce beneficial effects. Though he loses 
much personal responsibility, he gains as compensation a spirit of 
co-operation and a certain self-respect in his relations with other 
members of the group. These are eminently c< 1 ctivist virtues, but 
they are not negligible, and they assure the individual a certain 
human dignity in the collectivity of mass men.
While I have insisted on the “humanistic” tendencies of human 
techniques and, starting from the premise that man must be 
adapted to be happy, have tried to demonstrate the necessity of
The Technological Society ( 409
these techniques and their interrelation with all other techniques, 
my attitude has been resolutely optimistic. I have presupposed 
that technical practices and the intentions of the technicians wer$ 
subordinated to a concern with human good. And when I traced 
the background of the human techniques, I proceeded from the 
most favorable position, that of integral humanism, which, it is 
claimed, is their foundation.
But there are more compelling realities. The tendency towardpsy- 
chological collectivization does not have man’s welfare as its end. 
It is designed just as well for his exploitation. In today’s world, 
psychological collectivization is the sine qua non of technical ac­
tion. Munson says: “By building the morale of the troops, we are 
trying to increase their yield, to substitute enthusiastic self-disci­
pline for forced obedience, to stimulate their will and their attention 
— in short, we are pursuing success.” There he gives us the key to 
this kind of psychological action: the yield is greater when man 
acts from consent, rather than constraint. The problem then is to 
get the individual’s consent artificially through depth psychology, 
since he will not give it of his own free will. But the decision to 
give consent must appear to be spontaneous. Anyone who prates 
about furnishing man an ideal or a faith to live by is helping to 
bring about technique’s ascendency, however much he talks about 
“good will." The “ideal” becomes so through the agency of purely 
technical means whose purpose is to enable men to support an in­
supportable situation created within the framework of technical 
culture. This attitude is not the antithesis of the humanistic atti­
tude; the two are interwoven and it is completely artificial to try to 
separate them.
Human activity in the technical milieu must correspond to this 
milieu and also must be collective. It must belong to the order of 
the conditioned reflex. Complete human discipline must respond to 
technical necessity. And as the technical milieu concerns all men, 
no mere handful of them but the totality of society is to be con­
ditioned in this way. The reflex must be a collective one. As Munson 
savs: “In peacetime, morale building aims at creating among the 
troops that state of mental receptivity which makes them sus­
ceptible to every psychological excitation of wartime.” And this 
“receptivity” must also be instilled in every other human group in 
the technical culture, and especially in the masses of the workers.
4 10  ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
Psychological conditioning presupposes collectivity, for masses 
of men are more receptive to suggestion than individuals, and, as 
we have seen, suggestion is one of the most important weapons in 
the psychological arsenal. At the same time, the masses are intoler­
ant and think everything must be black or white. This results from 
the moral categories imposed by technique and is possible only 
if the masses are of a single mind and if countercurrents are not 
permitted to form.
The conditions for psychological efficiency are, first, group inte­
gration and, second, group unanimity. (This should not be taken 
to mean that on a larger scale there may not be a certain diversity.) 
I am speaking of a determinate group (for example, a political 
party, the army, an industrial plant) which has a definite technical 
function to fulfill. The purpose of psychological methods is to 
neutralize or eliminate aberrant individuals and tendencies to 
fractionation. Simultaneously, the tendency to collectivization is 
reinforced in order to “immunize” the environment against any 
possible virus of disagreement.
When psychological techniques, in close co-operation with ma­
terial techniques, have at last succeeded in creating unity, all pos­
sible diversity will have disappeared and the human race will have 
become a bloc of complete and irrational solidarity.
Total Integration
Until recently, we were obliged to think of man as divided in his 
relation to the technical world. One part of him was given over 
completely to the monster and subjected to the interior and ex­
terior rules; but the other part he could keep for himself: his inner 
life, his family life, his psychic life. He suffered from this division, 
but nonetheless he retained a very considerable measure of free­
dom. (When he insisted on retaining too much, he was said to be 
suffering from a proportionate lack of social adaptation.) Many 
more aspects of the human personality have been exposed to the 
technical society, and today very nearly the entire human race is 
experiencing this progressive cleavage of personality. The average 
man, with his sentimental and intellectual attachments to the past, i
The Technological Society (411
suffers acutely. Rare are the men who have so completely re­
nounced the inner life as to hurl themselves gladly and without 
regret into a completely technicized mode of being. Such persons 
may exist, but it is probable that the "joyous robot” has not yet 
been bom.
I have repeated time and again that this tension, this dichotomy, is 
harder and harder to bear and begins to appear more and more 
baneful in its influence even to the psychologists, sociologists, and 
teachers, that is, to the psychotechnicians in general. They want to 
restore man’s lost unity, and patch together that which technical 
advances have separated. But only one way to accomplish this ever 
occurs to them, and that is to use technical means. Since the 
human sciences are applications of technical means, this entails 
rounding up those elements of the human personality that are 
still free and forcing (“reintegrating” ) them into the expanding 
technical order of things. What yet remains of private life must be 
forced into line by invisible techniques, which are also implacable 
because they are derived from personal conviction. Reintegration 
involves man’s covert spiritual activities as well as his overt actions. 
Amusements, friendship, art—all must be compelled toward the 
new integration, thanks to which there is to be no more social 
maladjustment or neurosis. Man is to be smoothed out, like a pair 
of pants under a steam iron.
There is no other way to regroup the elements of the human 
personality: the human being must be completely subjected to an 
omnipotent technique, and all his acts and thoughts must be the 
object of the human techniques. Those men, undoubtedly "men of 
good will,” who are so preoccupied with the technical restoration 
of man’s lost unity certainly have not willed things as they have 
turned out. Their error lies much more in not having clearly seen 
genuine alternatives. The conscientious psychologist, sympathetic 
though he may be to human suffering, does not even consider al­
ternative solutions to the problem. For him, technique imposes a 
technical solution. And this solution indeed restores unity to the 
human being, but only by virtue of the total integration of man 
into the process which originally produced his dismemberment. 
The psychologist sees this dismemberment (and civilization’s neu­
roses, too) as symptomatic of the incompleteness of the absorptive 
process. To achieve unity, then, means to complete the process.
HUMAN TECHNIQUES41a)
Technical Anesthesia. It seems odd that the application of a tech* 
nique designed to liberate men from the machine should end in 
subjecting them the more harshly to it. But given the technological 
state of mind, the paradox is easily explained. Consider a worker 
who is subject to a machine and its caprices. He must follow the 
machine’s tempo and breathe its waste products. At the same time, 
he must fight off fatigue and boredom. In short, he must perform 
the work of two men. The efficiency expert comes and institutes 
procedures to automate actions and save energy by transforming 
everything into mechanical reflexes. But the psychologist is dead 
set against this; he finds insupportable the total subjection of the 
worker to the machine which the efficiency expert has elabo­
rated, and he proposes to liberate him. To accomplish this laudable 
end, the psychologist in turn elaborates a science of human be­
havior with its own laws of human psychology; for example, laws 
concerning worker fatigue, and so on. He draws up a program not 
merely of the worker's actions in the factory, but of his whole life. 
The human being ends by being encased in an even broader tech­
nical framework. It will doubtless make life easier and enable him 
to work with a minimum of effort, but only on condition that he 
follow its rules to the letter. The example is a simple one, but it 
can be found in every sphere of human activity, wherever the 
psychotechnician has felt himself called upon to ‘‘liberate’  man­
kind. Progress must obviously be paid for by even harsher subjec­
tion to the instrument of salvation. The worker is in the same 
situation as the invalid racked by pain who receives an anodyne 
narcotic which makes him an addict— the addiction persists even 
after he has been ‘‘cured.’  In much the same way, a nation that has 
been subjected to a totalitarian propaganda barrage is unable to 
get its bearings in a direct and natural way after the barrage has 
ceased; the psychic trauma was too profound. The sole means of 
liberating people from ‘‘ideas’  so inculcated is through another 
propaganda campaign at least as intense as the first. But the new 
propaganda only subjects them to a psychic pressure that kills a 
little more of their freedom.
Consider an inquisitorial and brutal police force that operates 
as it pleases and carries out arrests arbitrarily. No citizen has any 
peace of mind. Yet the only remedy so far devised for the disease 
is the establishment of the hypermodern system of dossiers. Every
The Technological Society ( 4 13
citizen is kept track of throughout his life, geographically, bio­
logically, and economically; the police know precisely what he is 
up to at every moment. This police system no longer needs to he 
brutal, openly inquisitorial, or omnipresent to the public con­
sciousness. But it permeates all of life, in a way the average citizen 
finds it impossible to understand. Just what has been gained? Ad­
mittedly, man need no longer be apprehensive at work, or live per­
petually under suspicion, or be afraid of being subjected to the 
“third degree." The terror which until now has been an integral 
part of the police methods of totalitarian states is, or soon will be, 
a thing of the past. The “terror over the city," perfectly described 
by Cerrado Alvaro, is only a transitory stage. A diffuse terror usu­
ally follows open police raids and public executions. At this stage 
the police may be invisible, but they lurk in the shadows. One 
hears tales of secret executions in the soundproof cellars of vast, 
mysterious buildings. At a still more advanced stage of police 
technique, even this diffuse terror gradually dissipates. The police 
exist only to protect “good citizens." They no longer carry out 
raids and there is nothing mysterious about them; therefore they 
are not felt to be oppressive. Police work has become “scientific.* 
Their files contain dossiers of every citizen. The police are in a 
position to lay hands on anyone “wanted" at any moment, and this 
obviates to a great degree the necessity of doing so. No one can 
evade the police or disappear. But, then, no one wants to. An 
electronic dossier is not particularly fearsome.
Here we have the essence of the techniques of “humanization": to 
render unnoticeable the disadvantages that other techniques have 
created. The task of the technician is to develop machine tech­
niques and human techniques to such a pitch of perfection that 
even the man face to face with the perfectly functioning machine 
no longer has human initiative or the desire to escape. In a simple 
machine, a sticking gear or an overheated rod calls the existence 
of the machine to the notice of its vexed user. A lubricating 
technique is needed which will make the machine function so 
smoothly that its presence is not felt The ability to forget the ma­
chine is the ideal of technical perfection. In the “man-machine" 
complex, friction results from the collision between the human 
being and the organization. This friction can take a number of 
forms. Individual initiative may become irritated by some obvious
HUMAN TECHNIQUES
mechanical failure; die individual may insist on operating the ma­
chine in a manner not provided for in the rules of automatism. 
The problem then is twofold: to perfect mechanical techniques, on 
the one hand, and to invent and impose certain human techniques, 
on the other, so as to obviate the human sources of friction. As 
Latil has pointed out, self-guiding techniques that operate with­
out any external interference are possible. This has been demon­
strated by machines that are autonomous, have a memory, and 
anticipate future events. Skeptics of the kind who denied a priori 
the possibility of heavier-than-air machines will deride this as 
mere imagination. It is true that such machines have not yet been 
perfected, but even an approximation in this direction would suf­
fice for our argument
The technical society must perfect the “man-machine” complex 
or risk total collapse. Is there any other way out? I am convinced 
that there is. Unfortunately, I am also compelled to note that 
neither the scientists nor the technicians want any part of any other 
solution. And since I work with realities and not with abstractions, 
I recognize the inevitability of the fact that technical difficulties de­
mand technical solutions. All the troubles provoked by the en­
counter between man and technique are of a technical order, and 
therefore no one dreams of applying nontechnical remedies. Men 
distrust them. A. Sargent well expresses the common opinion:
Humanity is still captive of a metaphysical and dogmatic men­
tality at a time when experimental science (technique) could be­
yond any doubt allow them to solve their principal difficulties. 
We are still half buried in scholasticism at a time when biology 
is in a position to be our salvation . . . Our dogmatisms have well 
shown their mischievousness . . .  It is therefore indispensable 
henceforth to resist the seductions of systems based on metaphysics 
and to face up to the one reality which we can understand and 
which concerns us . . . The life-sciences bring together certain 
means of knowledge and action. All doctrines which draw their 
inspiration from abstract conceptions have already betrayed their 
fundamental incapacity to organize the human world. Biocracy, 
that is, organization in accordance with the basic laws of life, 
represents our only chance of salvation at a moment of our devel­
opment in which the various metaphysics and systems left over 
from archaic cultures still corrupt human life.
The Technological Society (415
Sargent’s position is clear. What is catastrophic in our situation is 
the survival of philosophies, political doctrines, and religion. (I am 
unable, incidentally, to believe them so powerful!) As to tech­
nique, it is completely innocent of the imminent catastrophes. De­
spite exaggerations, the text is clear: no other solution is possible, 
no other hope, than that represented by the improvement of human 
techniques. Every other solution is either inefficient or mis­
chievous.
Sargent’s attitude is representative of that of the majority of 
technicians. We have already examined the kind of future it holds 
in store for us.
Integration of the Instincts and of the Spiritual. We shall now 
take up perhaps the most difficult technical phenomena to grasp, 
inasmuch as they do not concern human techniques directly, but 
rather certain of their results.
It is often objected that skeptics fail to understand the nature 
of technical society because they are unwilling or unable to accept 
the extraordinary power of spiritual resistance to technical inva­
sion of which human beings are capable. Everywhere, it is said, 
human liberty affirms itself in a world that the skeptics have de­
clared closed to it. In proof of this, literary and musical forms are 
invoked like magical incantations. Abstract painting, surrealism, 
jazz; ethical forms such as “eroticism” and the “politics of engage­
ment” are said to be manifestations of the supremacy of human 
freedom and will in the technical society. No one, of course, seeks 
to deny that these phenomena are immediately related to the tech- 
nicity of the present; the question is how they are to be interpreted. 
It is true that man has psychic power, the strength of which is not 
yet known Man is capable of outbursts of passion and violence. It 
does not seem that those sources of vital energy which might be 
summarized as sexuality, spirituality, and capacity for feeling have 
been impaired.
But every time these forces attempt to assert themselves, they 
are flung against a ring of iron with which technique surrounds 
and localizes them. Moreover, technique attacks man, impairs the 
sources of his vitality, and takes away his mystery. We have seen 
that one of the objectives of certain human techniques is to rob 
him of this mystery. And men must and do react instinctively and 
spiritually to the aggression of technique. When Henry Miller ut-
HUM AN TECHNIQUES416)
ters his anguished wail against the modem world, he is appealing 
through his fundamental eroticism to man’s most primitive in­
stincts. When the American Negro was still a slave, jazz meant 
release from despair and chains. But it is questionable that eroti­
cism and jazz really represent a purposive reaction to technical 
aggression. We cannot settle these problems by appealing to a 
purely verbal idealism.
Jazz is one of today’s most authentically human protests. Let us 
trace it back to its origin. The Negroes were hopelessly enslaved. 
The story of their toil, punishments, hate, and crushed rebellions 
has been often told. The terrible black emperor of Santo Domingo 
was now no more than a dream. In their extremity the Negroes 
discovered song, which likewise answered the needs of faith. 
Music expressed for them at once the despair of the present and 
the hope for salvation in Christ. Its culmination in delirium 
brought deliverance, but only as opium and alcohol did for others. 
Marx’s celebrated remark that nineteenth-century religion was the 
opiate of the European masses is equally applicable to the jazz of 
the Negro slaves. In jazz they created a true art form. But with it 
they also shut every door to freedom. Jazz imprisoned the Negroes 
more and more in their slavery; from then on, they drew a morose 
relish from it It is highly significant that this slave music has 
become the music of the modem world.
All instincts seem more unbridled today than ever before— sex; 
passion for nature, the mountains, and the sea; passion for social 
and political action. There cannot have been many historical pe­
riods in which these forces were so evident or so authoritative. 
Again, I have no wish to deny whatever validity they possess. It is 
good for city dwellers to go to the country. It is good that a marked 
eroticism is wrecking the sclerotic traditional morality. It is well 
that poetry, thanks to such movements as surrealism, has become 
really expressive once more. But these phenomena, whjch express 
the deepest instinctive human passions, have also become totally 
innocuous. They question nothing, menace nobody. Behemoth* 
can rest easy; neither Henry Miller’s eroticism nor.Andr£ Breton’s 
surrealism will prevent him from consuming mankind. Such move-
* Behemoth (Hebrew; plural of majesty) designates matter organized, glorified, and 
set in motion.

ments are pure formalisms, pure verbalisms. No one has ever car­
ried out the famous “pure surrealist act.' And as for the self-styled 
revolution in ethics of Miller and the “black novels' of Boris Vian 
and others, all they amount to for the noiinal man is an invitation 
to a brothel (something which has never passed for revolutionary 
or as an affirmation of freedom). It is harmless to attack a crum­
bling middle-class morality. True, persecutions, seizures, and law­
suits have been directed against the “black' authors. But I would 
like to point to the tidy profits that such minor scandals have 
brought them. I am somehow unable to believe in the revolutionary 
value of an act which makes the cash register jingle so merrily.
For a like reason, the “politics of engagement' are vitiated. The 
monolithic political parties consist of the fossilized rank and file 
(who can scarcely be thought to be manifesting any particular 
activity or to be striking a blow for freedom merely because the 
hearse which is transporting them is rolling along at a clip) and of 
party intellectuals and directors who are out after votes and 
money. It is as though a winner of the National Lottery could pass 
for a martyr.
Then there is the modern passion for nature. When it is not 
stockbrokers out after moose, it is a crowd of brainless conformists 
camping out on order and as they are told. Nowhere is there any 
initiative or eccentricity.
In sum, the supreme forces of human nature are set into motion 
for the sake of amusement. The great bell in the cathedral tower, 
formerly rung to call the city’s warriors to arms, is sounded to 
amuse foreign tourists. At this point I shall not make a lengthy 
analysis of the social forces we have been speaking of.* It is 
enough to indicate the contrast between the powers aroused and 
the ghastly mediocrity of the end products; between the preten­
sions of Andre Breton, for example, and the results. What has hap­
pened to the deepest human passions stems from many different 
causes. The only one of concern to us here is the fact that these 
spiritual movements are totally confined within a technical world. 
Here is yet another example of the phenomenon described at 
length in the second chapter, that technique encompasses the

de notre temps," Rdformt, 1949.
HUMAN TECHNIQUES4 l8 )
totality of present-day society. Man is caught like a fly in a bottle. 
His attempts at culture, freedom, and creative endeavor have be­
come mere entries in technique's filing cabinet.
The Final Resolution. A precise question is posed: Into what has 
technique transformed man’s efforts toward the spiritual?
One answer to this question is that technique possesses mo­
nopoly of action. No human activity is possible except as it is 
mediated and censored by the technical medium. This is the great 
law of the technical society. Thought or will can only be realized 
by borrowing from technique its modes of expression. Not even the 
simplest initiative can have an original, independent existence.
Suppose one were to write a revolutionary book. If it is to be 
published, it must enter into the framework of the technical or­
ganization of book publishing. In a predominantly capitalistic 
technical culture, the book can be published only if it can return 
a profit. Thus, it must appeal to some public and hence must re­
frain from attacking the real taboos of the public for which it is 
destined. The bourgeois publishing house will not publish Lenin; 
the “revolutionary” publishing house will not publish Paul Bourget; 
and no one will publish a book attacking the real religion of our 
times, by which I mean the dominant social forces of the techno­
logical society. Any author who seeks to have his manuscript pub­
lished must make it conform to certain lines laid down by the po­
tential publishers. A manuscript which in subject matter and for­
mat does not conform has no chance. This is the situation at the 
most elementary level of the technical publishing organization. One 
step further and we encounter the notorious system of the “re­
write.”
If the publishing system is state-owned, the publication of revo­
lutionary literature cannot even be considered. All this amounts to 
saying that technical forces, which were put into operation ostensi­
bly for the diffusion of thought, lead in practice to its emasculation. 
The same holds true for broadcasting under private capitalism or 
under state ownership. It is impossible to agree with the ideologues 
who assert that capitalism is synonymous with freedom of broad­
casting4  or with those who assert that state ownership means 
humanization.
4  M . Veilte’s analysis of this point is convincing. See his La Radio et Us homines 
(Paris: Editions de M inuit; 1951).
The Technological Society (419
O f course, we can write or teach anything, including por­
nography, inflammatory revolutionary manifestoes, and new eco­
nomic and political doctrines. But as soon as any of these appear 
to have any real effect in subverting the universal social order 
(which is establishing itself in every country of the world with the 
support of the overwhelming majority of the respective popula­
tions), they are forthwith excluded from the technical channels of 
communication. As Crozier justly remarks: "The intellectual has a 
difficult life. He can only live by communicating, but he has been 
deprived of the means without which he cannot communicate.” 
The intellectual has become a mere mouthpiece subject to the de­
mands of the various techniques. According to Wiener, this is the 
cause of the progressive sterilization of intellectual life in the 
modem world. As Wiener puts it, present-day methods of com­
munication exclude all intellectual activity except what is so con­
ventional that it has no decisive value.
In the same way technique controls the nascent love of nature. 
The lone city dweller on a camping trip escapes his technical fate 
momentarily. But suppose that the solitary camper swells to a 
throng, overflows the countryside, sets the woods on fire, and 
commits other nuisances? Suppose he disturbs the “paying” guests? 
or trespasses on private property and hunting preserves? The pub­
lic interest is then involved and technique intervenes, as it in­
variably does where large numbers of men are concerned. (In­
versely, technique is creating a culture in which if large numbers 
are not involved, there is nothing at all.) Intervention then takes 
the form of an administrative police technique. Obligatory camp 
sites are established, complete with regulations. The camper is 
forced to carry a license, and the erstwhile act of free individual 
decision becomes a purely technical matter.
When an individual engages in political action a corresponding 
technical mechanism is set in motion. Political action is no longer 
possible except as a mass phenomenon, and “engagement” pre­
supposes participation in a collectivity. Only a collectivity is 
wealthy enough to have at its disposal the means to “play politics." 
Only a collectivity can make itself felt in a world in which tech­
nique has given primacy to the quantitative rather than the qualita­
tive. Since an inorganic mass would be inefficient, the collectivity 
must be optimally organized, with all that this implies in the way
HUMAN TECHNIQUES420)
of unity, discipline, and tactical flexibility. These are the exclusive 
province of technical organization, a fact which straightway leads 
to the formation of monolithic political parties, which alone can 
hope for success. Once again technique imposes its iron law on the 
generous strivings of the individual heart.
These brief examples, taken from as diverse spheres as possible, 
make it evident that today every human initiative must use techni­
cal means to express itself. These technical means ipso facto 
“censor” initiative. First, they screen out whatever does not lend 
itself to technical expression; initiative remains a purely private 
matter, with no importance to the technical society. Second, they 
compel a rigid conformism; initiative is reduced to the lowest com­
mon denominator and is, in effect, emasculated. The interplay of 
the technical censorship with the pretended "anarehic” spiritual 
initiatives of the individual automatically produces the situation 
desired by Dr. Coebbels in his formulation of the great law of the 
technical society: “You are at liberty to seek your salvation as you 
understand it, provided you do nothing to change the social order.” 
All technicians without exception are agreed on this dictum. It is 
understood, of course, that the social order is everywhere essen­
tially identical: the variation from democracy to Communism to 
Fascism represents a merely superficial phenomenon.
A  second answer to our question of how technique has trans­
formed man’s quest for the spiritual involves an examination of the 
fate of the ecstatic *  impulses and phenomena of the human spirit.
It is not difficult to observe that ecstatic phenomena proliferate 
in proportion to the technicization of society. They play an impor­
tant role in modern society, but not the role usually assigned them. 
They function not as causes but as effects. It is childish to believe 
that Communism and Fascism, for example, created a mystique 
out of whole cloth, which they then imposed on their peoples; that 
they have blown up a vast bag of wind with which they “seduce” 
or “delude” the world. On the other hand, it is too easy to say that 
the Russian soul and the German soul were naturally “predisposed” 
to these systems. We would then have to hold that the Italian ( and
1 In what follows, the word ecstasy Is used in its original Creek sense to denote a 
mental state transported out of its usual condition. The word denotes anarchic and 
antisocial tendencies as well as the m ore pleasant transports we usually associate 
with it. It is the ground of war as well as of religion. (Trans.)
The Technological Society (421
now the Yugoslav and Chinese) souls, are similarly predisposed. 
The myth presupposes a psychological basis— that people adhere 
to systems because these systems respond to something “true” in 
them. But this truth is certainly not very specific since very dif­
ferent sorts of people adhere to it. Further, mystic systems are not 
arbitrary creations of dictatorial regimes. No more are they the 
result of the demented will to power of the mighty. No "popular 
movement” can produce them; the requirements far exceed the 
spontaneous mystic capabilities of man. The real reason for the 
emergence of society as we know it is not mystic or psychic but 
technical.
It is nevertheless true that ecstatic phenomena are'found today 
in the societies that have as their avowed aim the maximal exploita­
tion of technique. Ecstasy occurs here, however, not as a cause 
but as a result of the technical society. More specifically, it is a 
function of the acceleration of the tempo of the technical society,* 
rather than of the technical level of the society.
For a long time it was believed that technique would yield a har­
monious society, a society in equilibrium, happy and without spe­
cial problems. This society would resign itself to an easy life of 
production and consumption based on an untroubled commercial 
ideology. This model of bourgeois tranquillity seemed to corre­
spond exactly to the preoccupations of technology. The summum 
bonum was comfort, and the ideal type was capitalist Switzerland 
or socialist Sweden. The sudden plunge of the technically most 
advanced societies into war and mutual destruction was a rude 
awakening for the bourgeoisie. An aberration? Scarcely. It had 
been forgotten that technique means not comfort but power. The 
bourgeois countries had developed their technical systems at a 
comfortable pace, until these systems had fully exploited their pos­
sibilities of orderly growth. Then technology, with its accelerated 
tempo, took over. The smaller nations were unable to keep up. 
And the great technical countries had willy-nilly to abandon their
• Ellul anticipates here a recent preoccupation of so-called "general system  theory,” 
according to which social and psychological phenom ena depend for their specific 
results on the acceleration of linear systems ana not upon their position or velocities. 
The latter is usually a condition of equilibrium; the form er setaom  is. Thus, to give 
a trivial example, it is not the absolute value of the world’s population at any 
mom ent which threatens social dissolution, but the rate at which it is increasing, 
especially if the rate of increase is itself increasing. (Trans.)
422  ) HUMAN TECHNIQUES
languid pace and accommodate themselves to the real tempo of 
the technical society. The result was that disproportion between 
the leisurely bourgeois mentality and the explosive tempo of tech­
nique to which we give the name war. A by-product of this ecstasy 
was a certain mystique. The American myth was bom, presenting 
exactly the same religious traits as the Nazi or Communist myth. 
But it is different, as we have often noted, in that it still is in a 
spontaneous phase; it is not yet organized, utilized, and developed 
technically.
Whatever the actual technical level of the country, as soon as 
technical acceleration appears, the mystique appears too. Even 
technically backward societies experience it as soon as they decide 
to adopt modern techniques. So do such societies as the Nazi or the 
Communist when they take up and adapt to their system whatever 
is new. The more languid social groups, such as Switzerland or 
France, which cannot or will not submit to technical acceleration, 
do not manifest these phenomena.’
A nation which has reached a pitch of perfection in its technical 
organization sometimes feels this perfection to be intolerable. Suqh 
a factor was probably the cause of the astonishing ecstasy of “com- 
bativity without object” which erupted in Sweden in December 
1956. In a too-perfect universe the human being has no adequate 
way of releasing the deepest impulses of human nature. These ob­
scure forces are always there, and tend to emerge to the degree 
that perfect technical constraint has not yet been fully achieved.
These observations confirm Roger Caillois’s statement that die 
more restrictive the social mechanism, the more exaggerated are 
the associated ecstatic phenomena. The restrictions imposed by 
technique on a society reduce the number of ways in which re­
ligious energy can be released. In a nontechnical society there are a 
plurality of ways in which psychic energy can be channeled; but 
in a technical society there is only one. Technical restrictions elimi­
nate all secondary objects. Human psychic energies concentrate, 
and there are no ‘leaks.” The result is ecstatic phenomena of un­
paralleled intensity and duration.
In today’s technical society, magical and mystical tendencies 
which traditionally were in opposition are all mutually satisfied by

nationalistic mystique.
The Technological Society (423
technique and hence mafle one. Technique fully satisfies the mystic 
will to possess and dominate. It is unnecessary to evoke spiritual 
powers when machines give much better results. But technique 
also encourages and develops mystical phenomena. It promotes the 
indispensable alienation from the self necessary, for example, for 
the identification of the individual with an ideology. Whether man 
identifies with a father figure or with an abstraction, this identifica­
tion is incited by the recognition of an exceptional charismatic 
quality. This quality, integrated into the technical society, takes 
from it a compelling intensity it did not have before. It also takes 
on a mechanical character. The ecstatic phenomenon, organized, 
centralized, and diffused by technique, can only relate to a mecha­
nized charism which is capable of this relation. This charismatic 
endowment has traditionally been an attribute of heroes, but today 
itis the “heroes of labor” who are so endowed.
We must conclude that it is far from accidental that ecstatic phe­
nomena have developed to the greatest degree in the most techni- 
cized societies. And it is to be expected that these phenomena will 
continue to increase. This indicates nothing less than the subjec­
tion of mankind's new religious life to technique. It was formerly 
believed that technique and religion were in opposition and repre­
sented two totally different dispensations. It was held that, with 
the development of a purely materialistic society, a struggle was 
inevitable between the machine and the economy, on the one side, 
and the ideal realm of religion, art, and culture, on the other. But 
we can no longer hold such a boundlessly simplistic view. Ecstasy 
is subject to the world of technique and is its servant. Technique, 
on the most significant level, integrates the anarchic and antisocial 
impulses of the human being into society. These impulses take their 
influence and receive their diffusion strictly by virtue of the techni­
cal means brought into play. The ecstatic phenomena of the human 
psyche, which without technical means would have remained 
completely without effect, are deployed throughout the world.
Technical means, acting on the ecstatic phenomena, encourage 
certain daring innovations of expression. Consider, for example, the 
extraordinary artistic novelty of the cinema. But it must be re­
membered that the technical fact ipso facto entails the total in­
clusion of art and thought (however revolutionary they seem) 
within the social framework. Human impulses are confined within
HUMAN TECHNIQUES4 * 4 )
well-defined limits, and become the objects of propaganda, profit- 
seeking, contractual obligations, and the like. The vast extent of 
the technical apparatus makes the “payoff” inevitably the primary 
consideration, in money in the capitalist world, in power and au­
thority in the Communist world. Technique as a means, however, 
encourages and enables the individual to express his ecstatic reac­
tions in a way never before possible. He can express criticism of 
his culture, and even loathing. He is permitted to propose the mad­
dest solutions. The great law here is that all things are necessary to 
make a society and that even revolt is necessary to make a techni­
cal society. I believe that this is no exaggeration. Revolt is con­
sciously organized in the Soviet Union, for example, in Krokodll, 
the journal officially devoted to criticism of Soviet polity and ad­
ministration. The expression of criticism is permitted because its 
repression would be even more catastrophic. But it is permitted 
only on condition that it entail no serious consequences, or, better 
put, so that no serious consequences to the power of the state can 
result The technical apparatus, in fact, assures this by confining 
the most violent explosions of human ecstasy within itself and by 
satisfying without clanger and at small cost to itself certain spiritual 
needs of the citizen reader. It must not be supposed that there is 
any danger of the reader becoming a partisan of an author. Sartre 
complains that he has readers but no public. He gives certain com­
plex reasons for this, and some of them may even be true. But he 
does not see (or perhaps refuses to see) that the technical condi­
tions of publishing necessarily entail such a result. Sartre, of course, 
is not alone. What he complains of represents a long tradition. 
Technique, which transforms culture into luxury, puts so- many 
cultural modalities at the reader's disposal that none of them has 
any more importance than any other; the customer becomes a 
butterfly dipping into whatever flower he chooses. Sartre repre­
sents one ten-thousandth of French authorship, and he reaches 
twenty thousand readers. Not bad. But in the circumstances it is 
difficult to have a genuine community of readers. (I take it that 
the cellars of the Left Bank do not constitute the public Sartre 
dreams of.) Technique erects a screen between the author and his 
readers. Miniature fireworks issue from the magic bottle, but not 
revolt. A  few printed pages out of the deluge of printed matter 
will never make the butterfly a revolutionary.
The Technological Society ( 42 5
The complete separation of thought and action effected by 
technique produces in a new guise a phenomenon which we have 
already discussed as it appears in other areas: the lack of spiritual 
efficacy of even the best ideas. The very assimilation of ideas into 
the technical framework which renders them materially effective 
makes them spiritually worthless. This does not mean that ideas 
have no worthwhile effect on the public at all. They have a great 
effect, but not the effect their creators intended. Henry Miller’s 
erotic petard, launched onto society like a plastic bomb, finds a 
reader whose sexual life is thwarted, who is upset by the conditions 
of his work, his lodgings, his political life. This has created in him 
a thirst for revolt. And he finds his thirst powerfully and well ex­
pressed by Miller. The pornographic element unfetters his imagina­
tion and plunges him into an erotic delirium that can satisfy his 
contracted needs. But Miller’s book, far from pushing a man to 
revolt, vicariously satisfies the potential revolutionary, just as the 
sexual act itself stills sexual desire, or jazz soothes the Negroes’ 
bitter longing for freedom. We have noted that jazz has become 
universal. The reason is now clear: it is the music of men who are 
satisfied with the illusion of freedom provoked by its sounds, while 
the chains of iron wind round them ever tighter. The same mecha­
nism is at work on the reader of KrokodiL Seeing his discontent 
expressed far better than he could express it himself, he is satisfied 
vicariously with an official revolt and ceases to criticize . . .  at 
least for a while— but by then he will have received the next issue.
As a result of technique, these vicarious remedies are not local 
but universal phenomena. Technique diffuses the revolt of the 
few and thus appeases the need of the millions for revolt. The same 
could be said of all the ‘’movements’’ started since the turn of the 
century in response to the frustration of the most elementary hu­
man impulses. But can it be maintained, therefore, that social 
movements such as surrealism, youth hostels, revolutionary politi­
cal parties, anarchism, and so on, have failed? They have failed in 
that they have not achieved their own goals of re-creating the 
conditions of freedom and justice or of allowing man to rediscover 
a genuine sex life or intellectual life. But they have been com­
pletely successful from another point of view. They have per­
formed the sociological function of integration. Technical means 
are so important, so difficult to achieve and to manage, that it is
HUMAN TECHNIQUES426)
easier to have them if there is a group, a movement, an association. 
Such movements are based on authentic impulses and valid feel­
ings, and do allow a few individuals access to modes of expression 
which otherwise would have been closed to them. But their es­
sential function is to act as vicarious intermediaries to integrate 
into the technical society these same impulses and feelings which 
are possessed by millions of other men. Herein lies their Sociologi­
cal character. Certain deep ecstatic instincts and impulses would 
otherwise escape the jurisdiction of the technical society and be­
come a threat to it. Movements such as today’s existentialism, or 
eroticism in the form of a renovated Marquis de Sade or of the 
little pornographic reviews, are a sociological necessity to a techni­
cal milieu. The basic human impulses are unpredictable in their 
complex social consequences. But thanks to "movements’*  which 
integrate and control them, they are powerless to harm the techni­
cal society, of which henceforth they form an integral part. These 
movements perform a well-defined but completely involuntary 
function. Their operations are effected independently of will or 
desire. And no one has calculated their effects in advance. Andr6 
Breton and Henry Miller are innocent of the sociological function 
they have assumed. One can reproach them only for a fearful 
lack of clarity as to their position and function in the technical 
society.
All revolutionary movements are burlesques of the real thing, but 
this must not be imputed to the activities of Machiavellian wire­
pullers, The phenomenon appears naturally in the interaction of 
human techniques with social movements that seek to express basic 
human instincts. Our analysis could be repeated for pacifism, Com­
munism, and all the multifarious movements designed to secure 
peace or social justice. They all fall into the same pattern and 
fulfill the same function. Some are indeed more authentic and 
"truer” than others because they better express human revolt; they 
are more successful in pulling the teeth of aggressive instincts and 
in integrating them into the technical society. (If I have not men­
tioned religions, it is because they no longer express revolt; they 
have long since, in their intellectual and sociological forms, under­
gone integration.)
With the final integration of the instinctive and the spiritual by 
means of these human techniques, the edifice of the technical so-

ciety will be completed It will not be a universal concentration 
camp, for it will be guilty of no atrocity. It will not seem insane, 
for everything will be ordered, and the stains of human passion 
will be lost amid the chromium gleam. We shall have nothing more 
to lose, and nothing to win. Our deepest instincts and our most 
secret passions will be analyzed, published, and exploited. We 
shall be rewarded with everything our hearts ever desired. And 
the supreme luxury of the society of technical necessity will be to 
grant the bonus of useless revolt and of an acquiescent smile.
CHAPTER
m
A LOOK AT 
THE FUTURE
We have completed our examination of the monolithic technical 
world that is coming to be. It is vanity to pretend it can be checked 
or guided. Indeed, the human race is beginning confusedly to 
understand at last that it is living in 2 new and unfamiliar universe. 
The new order was meant to be a buffer between man and nature. 
Unfortunately, it has evolved autonomously in such a way that 
man has lost all contact with his natural framework and has to do 
only with the organized technical intermediary which sustains 
relations both with the world of life and with the world of brute 
matter. Enclosed within his artificial creation, man finds that there 
is “no exit”; that he cannot pierce the shell of technology to find 
again the ancient milieu to which he was adapted for hundreds of 
thousands of years.
The new milieu has its own specific laws which are not the laws 
of organic or inorganic matter. Man is still ignorant of these laws. 
It nevertheless begins to appear with crushing finality that a new 
necessity is taking over from the old. It is easy to boast of victory 
over ancient oppression, but what if victory has been gained at
The Technological Society (4*9
the price of an even greater subjection to the forces of the artificial 
necessity of the technical society which has come to dominate our 
lives?
In our cities there is no more day or night or heat or cold. But 
there is overpopulation, thraldom to press and television, total ab­
sence of purpose. All men are constrained by means external to 
them to ends equally external. The further the technical mechanism 
develops which allows us to escape natural necessity, the more we 
are subjected to artificial technical necessities. (I have analyzed 
human victory over hunger in this vein.) The artificial necessity 
of technique is not less harsh and implacable for being much less 
obviously menacing than natural necessity. When the Communists 
claim that they place the development of the technical society in a 
historical framework that automatically leads to freedom through 
the medium of the dialectical process; when Humanists such as 
Bergson, or Catholics such as Mounier, assert that man must re­
gain control over the technical “means” by an additional quantity 
of soul, all of them alike show both their ignorance of the technical 
phenomenon and an impenitent idealism that unfortunately bears 
no relation to truth or reality.
Alongside these parades of mere verbalisms, there has been a 
real effort, on the part of the technicians themselves, to control the 
future of technical evolution. The principle here is the old one we 
have so often encountered: “A technical problem demands a tech­
nical solution.” At present, there are two kinds of new techniques 
which the technicians propose as solutions.
The first solution hinges on the creation of new technical instru­
ments able to mediate between man and his new technical milieu. 
Robert Jungk, for example, in connection with the fact that man 
is not completely adaptable to the demands of the technical age, 
writes that “it is impossible to create interstellar man out of the 
existing prime matter; auxiliary technical instruments and appa­
ratus must compensate for his insufficiencies.” The best and most 
striking example of such subsidiary instruments is furnished by the 
complex of so-called “thinking machines,” which certainly belong 
to a very different category of techniques than those that have 
been applied up to now. But the whole ensemble of means de­
signed to permit human mastery of what were means and have now 
become milieu are techniques of the second degree, and nothing
A LOOK AT THE FUTURE4 3 0 )
more. Pierre de Latil, in his La PensSe artificielle, gives an ex­
cellent characterization of some of these machines of the second 
degree:
“In the machine, the notion of finality makes its appearance, a 
notion sometimes attributed in living beings to some intelligence 
inherent in the species, innate to life itself. Finality is artificially 
built into the machine and regulates it, an effect requiring that 
some factor be modified or reinforced so that the effect itself does 
not disturb the equilibrium . . . Errors are corrected without hu­
man analysis, or knowledge, without even being suspected. The 
error itself corrects the error. A deviation from the prescribed track 
itself enables the automatic pilot to rectify the deviation . . .For 
the machine, as for animals, error is fruitful; it conditions the cor­
rect path.”
The second solution revolves about the effort to discover (or re­
discover) a new end for human society in the technical age. The 
aims of technology, which were clear enough a century and a half 
ago, have gradually disappeared from view. Humanity seems to 
have forgotten the wherefore of all its travail, as though its goals 
had been translated into an abstraction or had become implicit; 
or as though its ends rested in an unforeseeable future of unde­
termined date, as in the case of Communist society. Everything 
today seems to happen as though ends disappear, as a result of 
the magnitude of the very means at our disposal.
Comprehending that the proliferation of means brings about the 
disappearance of the ends, we have become preoccupied with re­
discovering a purpose or a goal. Some optimists of good will assert 
that they have rediscovered a Humanism to which the technical 
movement is subordinated. The orientation of this Humanism may 
be Communist or non-Communist, but it hardly makes any dif­
ference. In both cases it is merely a pious hope with no chance 
whatsoever of influencing technical evolution. The further we ad­
vance, the more the purpose of our techniques fades out of sight 
Even things which not long ago seemed to be immediate objectives 
— rising living standards, hygiene, comfort— no longer seem to have 
that character, possibly because man finds the endless adaptation 
to new circumstances disagreeable. In many cases, indeed, a 
higher technique obliges him to sacrifice comfort and hygienic 
amenities to the evolving technology which possesses a monopoly

of the instruments necessary to satisfy them. Extreme examples are 
furnished by the scientists isolated at Los Alamos in the middle of 
the desert because of the danger of their experiments; or by the 
would-be astronauts who are forced to live in the discomfort of 
experimental camps in the manner so graphically described by 
Jungle.
But the optimistic technician is not a man to lose heart If ends 
and goals are required, he will find them in a finality which can be 
imposed on technical evolution precisely because this finality can 
be technically established and calculated. It seems clear that there 
must be some common measure between the means and the ends 
subordinated to it The required solution, then, must be a technical 
inquiry into ends, and this alone can bring about a systematization 
of ends and means. The problem becomes that of analyzing indi­
vidual and social requirements technically, of establishing, numeri­
cally and mechanistically, the constancy of human needs. It fol­
lows that a complete knowledge of ends is requisite for mastery of 
means. But, as Jacques Aventur has demonstrated, such knowledge 
can only be technical knowledge. Alas, the panacea of merely 
theoretical humanism is as vain as any other.1
“Man, in his biological reality, must remain the sole possible 
reference point for classifying needs,” writes Aventur. Aventur’s 
dictum must be extended to include man’s psychology and soci­
ology, since these have also been reduced to mathematical calcu­
lation. Technology cannot put up with intuitions and “literature.” 
It must necessarily don mathematical vestments. Everything in 
human life that does not lend itself to mathematical treatment must 
be excluded— because it is not a possible end for technique— and 
left to the sphere of dreams.
Who is too blind to see that a profound mutation is being ad­
vocated here? A new dismembering and a complete reconstitution 
of the human being so that he can at last become the objective 
(and also the total object) of techniques. Excluding all but the 
mathematical element, he is indeed a fit end for the means he has

constructed. He is also completely despoiled of everything that 
traditionally constituted his essence. Man becomes a pure appear­
ance, a kaleidoscope of external shapes, an abstraction in a milieu 
that is frighteningly concrete— an abstraction armed with all the 
sovereign signs of Jupiter the Thunderer.
A Look at the Year aooo. In i960 the weekly T Express of Paris 
published a series of extracts from texts by American and Rus­
sian scientists concerning society in the year 2000. As long as such 
visions were purely a literary concern of science-fiction writers and 
sensational journalists, it was possible to smile at them.’ Now we 
have like works from Nobel Prize winners, members of the 
Academy of Sciences of Moscow, and other scientific notables 
whose qualifications are beyond dispute. The visions of these 
gentlemen put science fiction in the shade. By the year 2000, voy­
ages to the moon will be commonplace; so will inhabited artificial 
satellites. All food will be completely synthetic. The world’s popu­
lation will have increased fourfold but will have been stabilized. 
Sea water and ordinary rocks will yield all the necessary metals. 
Disease, as well as famine, will have been eliminated; and there 
will be universal hygienic inspection and control. The problems of 
energy production will have been completely resolved. Serious 
scientists, it must be repeated, are the source of these predictions, 
which hitherto were found only in philosophic utopias.
The most remarkable predictions concern the transformation of 
educational methods and tire problem of human reproduction. 
Knowledge will be accumulated in “electronic banks” and trans­
mitted directly to the human nervous system by means of coded 
electronic messages. There will no longer be any need of reading 
or learning mountains of useless information; everything will be 
received and registered according to the needs of the moment. 
There will be no need of attention or effort. What is needed will 
pass directly from the machine to the brain without going through 
consciousness.
In the domain of genetics, natural reproduction will be forbidden. 
A stable population will be necessary, and it will consist of the 
highest human types. Artificial insemination will be employed. 
This, according to Muller, will "permit the introduction into a car-

having been taken from persons representing the masculine ideal 
and the feminine ideal, respectively. The reproductive cells in 
question will preferably be those of persons dead long enough 
that a true perspective of their lives and works, free of all personal 
prejudice, can be seen. Such cells will be taken from cell banks 
and will represent the most precious genetic heritage of hu­
manity . . . The method will have to be applied universally. If 
the people of a single country were to apply it intelligently and 
intensively . . . they would quickly attain a practically invincible 
level of superiority . . .” Here is a future Huxley never dreamed of.
Perhaps, instead of marveling or being shocked, we ought to 
reflect a little. A question no one ever asks when confronted with 
the scientific wonders of the future concerns the interim period. 
Consider, for example, the problems of automation, which will 
become acute in a very short time. How, socially, politically, mor­
ally, and humanly, shall we contrive to get there? How are the 
prodigious economic problems, for example, of unemployment, to be 
solved? And, in Muller’s more distant utopia, how shall we force 
humanity to refrain from begetting children naturally? How shall 
we force them to submit to constant and rigorous hygienic con­
trols? How shall man be persuaded to accept a radical transforma­
tion of his traditional modes of nutrition? How and where shall 
we relocate a billion and a half persons who today make their 
livings from agriculture and who, in the promised ultrarapid con­
version of the next forty years, will become completely useless as 
cultivators of the soil? How shall we distribute such numbers of 
people equably over the surface of the earth, particularly if the 
promised fourfold increase in population materializes? How will 
we handle the control and occupation of outer space in order to 
provide a stable modus vivendi? How shall national boundaries be 
made to disappear? (One of the last two would be a necessity.) 
There are many other -hows,” but they are conveniently left unfor­
mulated. When we reflect on the serious although relatively minor 
problems that were provoked by the industrial exploitation of coal 
and electricity, when we reflect that after a hundred and fifty years 
these problems are still not satisfactorily resolved, we are entitled 
to ask whether there are any solutions to the infinitely more com­
plex “hows” of the next forty years. In fact, there is one and only
A LOOK A T THE FUTURE4 3 4 )
one means to their solution, a world-wide totalitarian dictatorship 
which will allow technique its full scope and at the same time re­
solve the concomitant difficulties. It is not difficult to understand 
why the scientists and worshippers of technology prefer not to 
dwell on this solution, but rather to leap nimbly across the dull and 
uninteresting intermediary period and land squarely in the golden 
age. We might indeed ask ourselves if we will succeed in getting 
through the transition period at all, or if the blood and the suffer­
ing required are not perhaps too high a price to pay for this 
golden age.
If we take a hard, unromantic look at the golden age itself, we 
are struck with the incredible naivete of these scientists. They say, 
for example, that they will be able to shape and reshape at will 
human emotions, desires, and thoughts and arrive scientifically at 
certain efficient, pre-established collective decisions. They claim 
they will be in a position to develop certain collective desires, to 
constitute certain homogeneous social units out of aggregates of 
individuals, to forbid men to raise their children, and even to 
persuade them to renounce having any. At the same time, they 
speak of assuring the triumph of freedom and of the necessity of 
avoiding dictatorship at any price.* They seem incapable of grasp­
ing the contradiction involved, or of understanding that what 
they are proposing, even after the intermediary period, is in fact 
the harshest of dictatorships. In comparison, Hitler’s was a trifling 
affair. That it is to he a  dictatorship o f  t e s t  t u b e s  r a t h e r  t h a n  of 
hobnailed boots will not make it any less a dictatorship.
When our savants characterize their golden age in any but scien­
tific terms, they emit a quantity of down-at-the-heel platitudes that 
would gladden the heart of the pettiest politician. Let’s take a few 
samples. “To render human nature nobler, more beautiful, and 
more harmonious.” What on earth can this mean? What criteria, 
what content, do they propose? Not many, I fear, would be able 
to reply. “To assure the triumph of peace, liberty, and reason.” 
Fine words with no substance behind them. “To eliminate cultural 
lag.” What culture? And would the culture they have in mind be 
able to subsist in this harsh social organization? “To conquer outer
* The material here and below is cited from actual texts.

space.” For what purpose? The conquest of space seems to be an 
end in itself, which dispenses with any need for reflection.
We are forced to conclude that our scientists are incapable of 
any but the emptiest platitudes when they stray from their special­
ties. It makes one think back on the collection of mediocrities ac­
cumulated by Einstein when he spoke of God, the state, peace, and 
the meaning of life. It is clear that Einstein, extraordinary mathe­
matical genius that he was, was no Pascal; he knew nothing of 
political or human reality, or, in fact, anything at all outside his 
mathematical reach. The banality of Einstein’s remarks in matters 
outside his specialty is as astonishing as his genius within it. It 
seems as though the specialized application of all one’s faculties in 
a particular area inhibits the consideration of things in general. 
Even J. Robert Oppenheimer, who seems receptive to a general 
culture, is not outside this judgment. His political and social dec­
larations, for example, scarcely go beyond the level of those of the 
man in the street. And the opinions of the scientists quoted by 
fExpress are not even on the level of Einstein or Oppenheimer. 
Their pomposities, in fact, do not rise to the level of the average. 
They are vague generalities inherited from the nineteenth century, 
and the fact that they represent the furthest limits of thought of our 
scientific worthies must be symptomatic of arrested development 
or of a mental block. Particularly disquieting is the gap between 
the enormous power they wield and their critical ability, which 
must be estimated as null. To wield power well entails a certain 
faculty of criticism, discrimination, judgment, and option. It is im­
possible to have confidence in men who apparently lack these 
faculties. Yet it is apparently our fate to be facing a “golden age” 
in the power of sorcerers who are totally blind to the meaning of 
the human adventure. When they speak of preserving the seed of 
outstanding men, whom, pray, do they mean to be the judges. It 
is clear, alas, that they propose to sit in judgment themselves. It is 
hardly likely that they will deem a Rimbaud or a Nietszche worthy 
of posterity. When they announce that they will conserve the 
genetic mutations which appear to them most favorable, and that 
they propose to modify the very germ cells in order to produce 
such and such traits; and when we consider the mediocrity of the 
scientists themselves outside the confines of their specialties, we
A LOOK AT THE FUTUM4 3 6 )
can only shudder at the thought of what they will esteem most 
"favorable.”
None of our wise men ever pose the question of the end of all 
their marvels. The “wherefore” is resolutely passed by. The re­
sponse which would occur to our contemporaries is: for the sake 
of happiness. Unfortunately, there is no longer any question of 
that One of our best-known specialists in diseases of the nervous 
system writes: "We will be able to modify man’s emotions, desires 
and thoughts, as we have already done in a rudimentary way with 
tranquillizers.” It will be possible, says our specialist to produce a 
conviction or an impression of happiness without any real basis 
for it. Our man of the golden age, therefore, will be capable of 
"happiness” amid the worst privations. Why, then, promise us 
extraordinary comforts, hygiene, knowledge, and nourishment if, 
by simply manipulating our nervous systems, we can be happy 
without them? The last meager motive we could possibly ascribe to 
the technical adventure thus vanishes into thin air through the very 
existence of technique itself.
But what good is it to pose questions of motives? of Why? All that 
must be the work of some miserable intellectual who balks at tech­
nical progress. The attitude of the scientists, at any rate, is clear. 
Technique exists because it is technique. The golden age will be 
because it will be. Any other answer is superfluous.
Bibliography
In connection with this bibliography, the following points should be noted:
l) It makes no pretense to be exhaustive. I have listed only the works I 
have actually used and cited in the text. And since books are made to be read 
and not consulted, 1 have refected the scholarly tradition of specifying pages 
in footnotes.
a) I have omitted systematically most works predating J940. They are 
readily available elsewhere.
3) I have also omitted literary works on technique, such as those of 
Duhamel, Huxley, Ernst Jiinger, Orwell, Cheorgiu, and others.
4) I have not inserted references relating to propaganda and psychological 
techniques, since these will be found m my forthcoming work on propaganda.
To these remarks of the author the translator wishes to odd that it was 
impossible to check quotations cited in the text, since page references are 
locking. In some cases, therefore, English has been translated into French 
and then back into English, a procedure which can conceivably lead to novel 
effects. But as M. Ellul has remarked, the books cited are to be read and not 
consulted.
Publisher's Note. This bibliography is somewhat less extensive 
than the bibliography in the original French edition since it in­
cludes only those works which are readily available in American 
libraries.

SOCIOLOGY & POLITICAL SCIENCE
"Jacques Ellul is a French sociologist, a Catholic layman active 
in the ecumenical movement, a leader of the French resistance 
in the war, and—one is tempted to add, after reading his book— 
a great man. Certainly he has written a magnificent book. 
...The translation by John Wilkinson is excellent.
"With monumental calm and maddening thoroughness he goes 
through one human activity after another and shows how it has 
been technicized—rendered efficient—and diminished in the 
process....”
— Paul Pickrel, Harper’s
"The Technological Society is one of the most important books 
of the second half of the twentieth century. In it, Jacques Ellul 
convincingly demonstrates that technology, which we continue 
to conceptualize as the servant of man, will overthrow everything 
that prevents the internal logic of its development, including hu­
manity itself—unless we take the necessary steps to move 
human society out of the environment that ‘technique’ is creat­
ing to meet its own needs.”
— Robert Theobald, The Nation
"...The effect is a contained intellectual explosion, a heated 
recognition of a tragic complication that has overtaken con­
temporary society."
— Scott Buchanan, George Washington Law Review
