If your new\nbehavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group...\nthen to hell with them.\" \nRebuttal, Munger on Buffett \n \nI think there's some mythology in the idea that I've been this great\nenlightener of Warren. He hasn't needed much enlightenment. I frankly\nthink I got more credit than I deserve. It is true that Warren had a touch of\nbrain block from working under Ben Graham and making it ton of money.\nIt's hard to switch from something thats worked so well. But if Charlie\nMunger had never lived, the Buffett record would still be pretty much what\nit is.\n\f\nIt's hard to believe that he's getting better with each passing year. It won't go\non forever, but Warren is actually improving. It's remarkable: Most men in\ntheir seventies are not improving. but Warren is. Berkshire is drowning in\nmoney-we have great businesses pounding out money. When Warren is\ngone, the acquisition side of Berkshire will not do as well, but the rest will\ndo well. And the acquisition side will do just fine. \nI think the top guy' won't be as smart as Warren. But it's silly to complain,\n\"What kind of world is this that gives me Warren for forty years and then\nsome bastard comes along who's worse?\" \n \nIntroduction by Peter D Kaufman \n \nThroughout the book, Charlie reveals his intellect, wit, values, and no end\nof rhetorical flair. His encyclopedic knowledge allows him to cite\nreferences from classical orators to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century\nEuropean literati to pop culture icons of the moment. Where else would you\nfind Demosthenes and Cicero juxtaposed against Johnny Carson or today's\ninvestment managers set against Nietzsche, Galileo, and a \"one-legged man\nin an ass-kicking contest\"? Or how about Ben Franklin versus Bernie\nCornfield in a battle of worldly wisdom? Using self deprecation and\nimagination to great effect, Charlie cheerfully compares himself to a\ncounting horse, proposes \"Glotz's sugared, caffeinated water\" as a\nmarketing-bereft label for Coca-Cola, and attests, \"At least when I was\nyoung I wasn't a total klutz.\"\n\f\nIn one talk (Practical Thought About Practical Thought?), Charlie even\ntakes on the challenge of building, from scratch, a two-trillion-dollar\nbusiness, and then walks us through his diverse mental models to\naccomplish that mighty feat. \nThe quotes, talks, and speeches presented here are rooted in the old-\nfashioned Midwestern values for which Charlie has become known:\nlifelong learning, intellectual curiosity, sobriety, avoidance of envy and\nresentment, reliability, learning from the mistakes of others, perseverance,\nobjectivity, willingness to test one's own beliefs, and many more. But his\nadvice comes not in the form of stentorian admonishments; instead, Charlie\nuses humor, inversions (following the directive of the great algebraist,\nJacobi, to \"Invert, always invert\"), and paradox to provide sage counsel\nabout life's toughest challenges. \n \nCharlie also employs historical and business case studies to great effect. In\nthese presentations, he makes his points with subtlety and texture, often\nusing a story-like context instead of abstract statements of theory. He\nregales his audience with humorous anecdotes and poignant tales, rather\nthan with a blizzard of facts and figures. He well knows, and wisely\nexploits, the traditional role of the storyteller as purveyor of complex and\ndetailed information. As a result, his lessons hang together in a coherent\n\"latticework\" of knowledge, available for recall and use when needed. \n \nIt is clear throughout these talks and speeches that Charlie places a\npremium on life decisions over investment decisions. His mental models,\ndrawn from every discipline imaginable, recur repeatedly and, in no way,\n\f\nfocus on \"business portfolio strategy\" or \"beta\" or \"Cap M.\" Rather they\ncenter on fundamental truth, human accomplishment, human foibles, and\nthe arduous path to wisdom. Charlie once said, \"i wanted to get rich so I\ncould be independent, like Lord John Maynard Keynes.\" Independence is\nthe end that wealth serves for Charlie, not the other way around. \n \nAbout the Book: \n \nWe open with a \"portrait\" biography that chronicles Charlie's progress from\na modest Omaha childhood to prodigious financial success. New to the\nsecond edition, Charlie then offers us his reflections on aging, inspired by\nCicero's Discourse of Old Age. Next, we summarize the Munger approach\nto life, learning, decision making, and investing. This section details both\nCharlie's unconventional way of thinking and his extraordinary work ethic-\nthe twin fonts of his amazing success. Our \"Mungerisms: Charlie\nUnscripted\" section presents a collection of the trenchant remarks he has\nmade at past Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco Financial annual meetings. \n \nIn the balance of the book, Charlie speaks to his audience via speeches and\ntalks he gave over a twenty-year period. In this expanded third edition of\nthe book, we have added a new talk Charlie delivered at the USC Gould\nSchool of Law Commencement on May 13th, 2007. So the original \"Ten\nTalks\" have grown to become a not-so-round \"Eleven Talks.\" These\nspeeches and addresses cover a wide spectrum of Charlie's interests,\nranging from how one acquires worldly wisdom, to how his \"Multiple\nMental Models\" can be applied to business, so how the investment"

    "raw_text": "strategies used by charitable foundations can be improved. The eleventh\ntalk is a special edition of \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\" that\nCharlie created especially for this book. Each talk is well worth our time\nnot only for the enjoyment it will provide you, but also for what you can\nabsorb from the rich assortment of ideas and practices that Charlie relies on.\nYou will probably never find a better opportunity to learn from someone so\nsmart-and so forthright. In his talks, Charlie simply opens up and tells it like\nit is. A special note: Charlie's redundancy in expressions and examples is\npurposeful: for the kind of deep \"fluency\" he advocates, he knows that\nrepetition is the heart of instruction. \n \nA word about the style and layout of the book: Charlie is enormously\ncurious about nearly everything he bumps into in life. Accordingly, as we\nourselves bumped into people, places, and subjects mentioned by Charlie in\nhis talks, we supplemented his text with related information, photographs,\nand other graphics. The \"sidebars\" peppered throughout the talks, for\nexample, serve to explain concepts, add a supporting voice, or emphasize\nan important Munger idea. We hope these sidebars will not only inform, but\nalso amuse and even encourage you to further pursue these subjects on your\nown. \nI wish you good reading and an appreciation of the brightness and dry\nhumor that those of us who know Charlie Munger have come to treasure\nand expect from him. \n \nChapter 1\n\f\nA Portrait of Charles T Munger By\nMichael Broggie \n \n\"The next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a\nrecollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible\nby putting it down in writing.\" - Benjamin Franklin \n \nBehind the extraordinary story of Berkshire Hathaway are two financial\ngeniuses: the widely acclaimed Warren Buffett and his \"silent partner,\"\nCharlie Munger, who relishes his obscurity. \n \nCharlie is Warren's friend, lawyer, adviser, devil's advocate (Warren once\ncalled him the \"abominable no-man\"), and one of the largest stockholders in\none of the most successful publicly traded companies in American business\nhistory.

    "raw_text": "of their shifts to cover the cost of the new Social Security Act, In return,\nthey received a $2 daily wage along with the admonition that socialism is\ninherently evil. \n \nWhile Warren is one of the most admired and publicized business leaders in\nthe country Charlie has purposefully sidestepped the limelight, choosing\nrelative anonymity instead. To better understand this complex and highly\nprivate businessman, we must start at the beginning. Charles Thomas\nMunger was born on January 1, 1924, in America's heartland, Omaha,\nNebraska. Many notables share his Midwestern roots: Will Rogers, Henry\nFonda, John Pershing, Harry Truman, Walt Disney, Ann Landers, Gerald\nFord-and, of course, Warren Buffett. \nCharlie initially crossed paths with the Buffett family during the formative\nyears of his life when he worked at Buffett and Son, an upscale grocery\nstore in Omaha, about six blocks from the Munger household. The boss and\npart-owner was Warren's grandfather, Ernest. A strict disciplinarian, he\nscheduled his young workers for twelve-hour shifts with no meals or\nbreaks. According to Charlie, his boss’s staunch anti socialist attitude was\nmanifested in his rule requiring the boys to present two pennies at the end\nof their shifts to cover the cost of the new Social Security Act, In return,\nthey received a $2 daily wage along with a considerable lecture about the\nevils of socialism. \n \nThe arduous working conditions in the Buffett grocery store had a lasting\ninfluence on both Charlie and Warren. Warren, six years younger, served his\n\f\nhard times under Grandpa Ernest several years after his future business\npartner had moved on. \nCharlie's formal education began at Dundee Elementary School where he\nand his younger sisters, Nancy and Carol, were indoctrinated with ethical\nhomilies. Charlie's teachers remember a smart kid who was also incline to\nbe a bit of a wiseacre. he enjoyed challenging the conventional wisdom of\nteachers and fellow. students with his ever-increasing knowledge gained\nthrough voracious reading, particularly biographies. Today he can't\nremember the first time he was exposed to the aphorisms of Benjamin\nFranklin, but they fledged an ineffaceable admiration for eclectic and\neccentric statesman/inventor. Charlie's parents, Al and Florence Munger,\nencouraged reading \nand gave each of their children several books at Christmas, usually\ndevoured by that night. \n \nAt the nearby home of the Mungers' close friends, the Davises, Charlie\noften read the medical journals belonging to Dr. Ed Davis, who was both\nhis father's best friend and a family physician. Charlie's early exposure to\nDr. Davis's medical library spawned a lifelong interest in science. By the\ntime he was fourteen, the precocious learner also became one of the doctor's\nbest friends. Charlie became so interested in medicine that he watched\nmotion Pictures of Dr. Davis, a urologist, performing surgery and became\nfascinated with the statistical outcomes of similar procedures in the field. \n \nAt home, Charlie developed a fondness for raising hamsters and\nperiodically traded them with other children.\n\f\nEven at an early age, Charlie showed sagacious negotiating ability and\nusually gained a bigger specimen or one with unusual coloring. When his\nbrood grew to thirty five animals, his mother ordered an end to his hobby\nbecause of pungent odor from his basement hamster farm. One of his sisters\nremembered years later that the family had to endure the incessant\nsqueaking of hungry hamsters until Charlie arrived home from school to\nfeed them. \n \nCharlie attended Central High School, a very large public school rather\nrecognized as a good college preparatory school. The teachers, mostly\nwomen, were dedicated to work and to their students. Central High\ncurriculum provided a conventional classic education, in which Charlie\nnaturally excelled because of his logically driven, inquiring mind. \n \nThroughout elementary and secondary school, Charlie was younger and\nsmaller than his classmates, having been moved ahead in elementary school\nafter his mother taught him to read phonetically. Too small to compete in\nregular high school sports, he joined the rifle team, earned a varsity letter,\nand eventually became team captain. His Letterman's sweater (\"a large\nletter on a very small chest\" is Charlie's memory) attracted attention from\ncoeds who wondered how such a scrawny kid could earn a varsity letter.\nFortunately for Charlie, his father was an avid outdoorsman and duck\nhunter and took joy in his son's marksmanship. \nOmaha in the 1920s was the proverbial melting pot; different races and\nreligions mixed socially and commercially, and crime was practically\nunknown. Doors and vehicles were left unlocked, and a person's word was\n\f\ntrusted implicitly. Kids played \"Kick the Can\" on warm summer evenings\nand went to Saturday matinees to see the latest \"talkies,\" such as King\nKong, a favorite of eight-year-old Charlie. \nThe 1930s brought hard times, and Omaha experienced the severity of the\nGreat Depression. Charlie's observations of the plight of those less fortunate\nmade lasting impressions. He saw hobos roaming the streets looking for\nhandouts and others who were willing to sweep a driveway or porch in\nexchange for a sandwich. Thanks to family connections, Charlie landed a\nboring job counting passersby; it paid forty cents an hour. \nCharlie preferred this work to carrying heavy boxes of groceries. \n \nCharlie learned that, by supporting each other the Mungers weathered the\nworst economic collapse in the nation's history. \n \nCharlie's grandfather was a respected federal judge, and his father followed\nin his footsteps to become a prosperous lawyer. Charlie's immediate family\nwas not dramatically affected by the depression, but some members of\nCharlie's extended family were. This era provided real learning experiences\nfor young Charlie. He witnessed the generosity and business acumen of his\ngrandfather as he helped rescue a small bank in Strasbourg, Nebraska, that\nwas owned by Charlie's Uncle Tom. \nBecause of the miserable economy and drought-damaged crops, the bank's\nfarm based clients were defaulting on loans. Tom had rolled up $35,000 in\nuncollectible notes when he called upon Grandpa Munger for support. The\njudge risked nearly half of his assets by exchanging $35,000 in sound first\nmortgages for the bank's weak loans, thus enabling Tom to open his doors\n\f\nafter Roosevelt's bank holiday. The judge eventually recovered most of his\ninvestment, but not until a great many years later. \nJudge Munger also sent his daughter's husband, a musician, to pharmacy\nschool and helped him buy a well-located pharmacy that had closed because\nof the depression. The business prospered and secured the future for\nCharlie's aunt. Charlie learned that, by supporting each other, the Mungers\nweathered the worst economic collapse in the nation's history. \n \nFortunately, Al Munger's law practice prospered during the depression and\nwas given a boost when the United States Supreme Court agreed to review\na tax case involving a small soap-making company he represented.\nCoincidentally, the huge Colgate-Palmolive Company was also affected by\nthe Court's decision. Concerned that the Midwestern attorney didn't have\nthe requisite experience to argue successfully before the highest\ncourt, Colgate offered to pay Al liberally to step aside and allow a famous\nNew York attorney to take his place. The big-city lawyer lost the case while\nAl pocketed a substantial fee. Later, he joked that he could have lost the\ncase just as well for a much smaller fee. The amount of the fee has never\nbeen revealed, but it was enough, when combined with income Al earned\nfrom his other clients, to help keep the Mungers comfortable during the\ndepression. Charlie also helped the family by working to earn his own\nspending money and thus learned first-hand the value of financial\nindependence. \n \nIn 1941, as the war raged across the Atlantic, Charlie graduated from\nCentral High School and left Omaha for the University of Michigan. There\n\f\nhe chose mathematics as his major, drawn by the appeal of numerical logic \nand reason. He also discovered physics after enrolling in a basic course to\nfulfill an academic requirement for science. Charlie was fascinated by the\npower of physics and its boundless reach. In particular, he was impressed\nby the process followed by physicists, such as Albert Einstein, to address\nthe unknown. Physics-like problem solving was to become a passion for\nCharlie and is a skill he considers helpful in framing the problems of life.\nHe has often stated that anyone who wants to be successful should study\nphysics because its concepts and formulas so beautifully demonstrate the\npowers of sound theory. \n \nCollege-aged men were then in high demand for military service' Days after\nturning nineteen and completing his second year at Michigan, Charlie\nenlisted in the Army Air Corps in a program that would eventually make\nhim a second lieutenant' He was sent to the Albuquerque campus of the\nUniversity of New Mexico for studies in general science and engineering.\nNext he was shuffled to the prestigious California Institute of Technology in\nPasadena, California. He was schooled in thermodynamics and the science\nof meteorology-then essential to fliers-and trained to become a\nmeteorologist. After completing his studies at Caltech, Charlie was\ndispatched to a permanent duty station in Nome, Alaska. \n \nWhile still in the service, he married Nancy Huggins, a young woman from\nPasadena who was a good friend of his sister Mary at Scripps College. They\nwere stationed in Albuquerque and then San Antonio until Charlie was\n\f\ndischarged from the Army Air Corps in 1946. Soon Charlie and Nancy had\ntheir first child, a boy whom they named Teddy. \nAlthough he had attended several universities, Charlie still did not have a\nbachelor's degree. Nevertheless, using the GI Bill, he applied to Harvard\nLaw School where his father had preceded him. His lack of an\nundergraduate degree threatened to derail him, but a family friend, former\nHarvard Law School Dean Roscoe Pound, interceded on Charlie's behalf.\nCharlie was admitted, despite the determination of the admissions office to\nfirst send him back to college. \n \nAs it turned out, Charlie had little trouble succeeding at Harvard though he\nannoyed a few people along the way. \n \nAs it turned out, Charlie had little trouble succeeding at Harvard though he\nannoyed a few people along the way because of his intellect (the Army\nmeasured his IQ. at top of the curve), Charlie had a tendency to be abrupt,\nwhich was often interpreted as rudeness. Actually', Charlie was just in a\nhurry and customary pleasantries of the classroom were of little concern to\nhim. Even so. he was liked by most of his peers and fully enjoyed the social\naspects of student life in Cambridge. \n \nCharlie graduated from Harvard law School in 1948 and was one of twelve\nin his class of 335 to graduate magna cum laude. He considered joining his\nfather's law practice, but, after a discussion with his father. both of them\nconcluded that Charlie should try a larger city. He headed off to Southern\nCalifornia, a place he had liked while a student at Caltech. After passing\n\f\nCalifornia bar exam, he joined the firm of Wright & Garrett, later re named\nNicklaus, Peeler & Garrett. Charlie built a house, designed by his architect\nuncle, Frederick Scott. in South Pasadena where he and Nancy and their\nthree children, Teddy, Molly and Wendy lived. \n \nDespite outward appearances, all was not sunny in Charlie's world. His\nmarriage was in trouble, and he and his wife finally divorced in 1953. Not\nlong thereafter, Charlie learned that his adored son, Teddy, was terminally\nill with leukemia. It was a significant burden for twenty-nine-year-old\nCharlie. In that era, before bone marrow transplants, there was no hope. A\nfriend remembers that Charlie would visit his dying son in the hospital and\nthen walk the streets of Pasadena crying. \n \nDuring this sad time, his friend and law partner, Roy Tolles, arranged\nthrough a friend for Charlie to meet Nancy Barry Borthwick, who lived in\nLos Angeles. She was a Stanford graduate and had two small boys, close to\nthe ages of his girls. Charlie and Nancy had much in common and had fun\ntogether, and after a few months of dating became engaged. They were\nmarried in a small family wedding in January 1956, and all four children,\nhis girls and her boys, ages four to seven, attended the wedding. \n \nCharlie and Nancy lived in her house in the hills of west Los Angeles for\nseveral years. Then, partly to shorten Charlie's daily commute, they moved\nto Hancock Park where they still reside. The house they built there was\nlarge enough for their ever-expanding family: three more boys and a girl for\na total of eight. Fortunately, both liked children! They also liked golf, the\n\f\nbeach, and social clubs. Charlie and Nancy were soon members of the\nUniversity Club, the California Club, the Los Angeles Country Club, and\nthe Beach Club. \n \nWith many new responsibilities, Charlie worked hard at his law practice.\nEven so, his earnings were unsatisfactory to him as they were based on a\ncombination of billable hours and seniority. He wanted more than what a\nsenior law partner would be able to earn. He sought to be like his firm's\nleading capitalist clients, \nin particular, the universally admired Harvey Mudd, later the founder of the\ncollege bearing his name. With Nancy's support, he turned to outside\nventures and alternative ways to generate income. However, he never forgot\nthe sound principles caught by his grandfather: to concentrate on the task\nimmediately in front of him and to control spending. \n \nFollowing this conservative approach, Charlie seized opportunities to build\nwealth. He began investing in stocks and acquired equity in one of his\nclient's electronics businesses-a practice common among lawyers in the\nmid-1950s and 1960s. This investment was mutually beneficial: Charlie\ngained invaluable knowledge about \nbusiness while his client enjoyed proactive attention of a lawyer who knew\nmore than just the law. \nIn 1961, Charlie tackled property development for first time, in partnership\nwith Otis Booth, a client and friend. The venture, building condominiums\non land near Caltech, was a smashing success, and partners earned a\nhandsome profit of $300,000 on a $100,000 investment. Charlie and Otis\n\f\nthen undertook other successful construction and development projects in\nPasadena. Later, Charlie participated in similar projects in Alhambra,\nCalifornia. He sharpened his business acumen by canceling the negotiations\nand contracts. In all cases, he left all of his profits in real estate ventures so\nthat bigger and bigger projects became possible. When he stopped in 1960,\nhe had a nest egg of $1 million from real estate projects alone. \n \nIn February' 1962, he joined four colleagues from Musick, Peeler &\n(character in establishing a new law firm. The original partners were Roy\nTolles, Rod Fills, Dick Esbcn Shackle, Fred Warder, and Charlie. they were\njoined by ,Rod's wife, Carla, and James T Wood, a sole practitioner and\nfriend of the Hills, and, importantly, who had a client. They named the firm\nMunger, 'belles & Hills. Over the years, the firm had several names, always\nbeginning with Munger, Tolles. With the addition of Ron Olson, it finally\nbecame Munger Tolles & Olson, shortened as \"Munger Tolles\" or \"MTO.\" \n \nThe successful practice of law was by then a backstop rather than an ending\nobjective for Charlie. At about the time that he was launching his new law\nfirm, he was carefully crafting his exit plan. Charlie set up an investment\npartnership with Jack Wheeler, and they were later joined by Al Marshall.\nThe idea for this partnership arose a few years earlier when the death of\nCharlie's father required him to return to Omaha to administer the estate. To\nwelcome him home, the children of Charlie's friend and medical mentor, Dr.\nEd Davis, arranged for a dinner party. Both of the Davis boys, Eddie Jr. and\nNeil, were former childhood chums of Charlie and were now physicians\nwhile their sister Willa had married an Omaha businessman, Lee Seemann.\n\f\nThe dinner party included Willa and Lee, Neil and his wife Joan, and a\nfellow named Warren Buffett. \n \nThe dinner party included Willa and Lee, Neil and his wife Joan, and a\nfellow named Warren Buffett. \n \nCharlie recognized Warren's family name from his days at Buffett and Son,\nand Warren had heard of Charlie a few years earlier when he was raising\ninvestment capital in Omaha. At one point, Warren had met with Dr. Davis\nand his wife, Dorothy, to explain his investment philosophy, and they\nagreed to place a large part of their life savings-$100,000-with him. Why?\nThe doctor explained that Warren reminded him of Charlie Munger. Warren\ndidn't know Charlie but already had at least one good reason to like him. \n \nDuring the homecoming dinner, Charlie and Warren realized they shared\nmany ideas. It also became evident to the others at the table that this was\ngoing to be a two-way conversation. As the evening progressed, the two\nyoung person were twenty-nine and Charlie thirty-five engrossed in a wide-\nranging dialogue covering many aspects of business, finance, and history.\nWhere one was knowledgeable, the other was just as excited to learn. \n \nQ and A with Warren Buffett \n \nOK, the first question is how, when, and where did you first meet Charlie\nMunger?\n\f\nWell, I first met Charlie in 1959 when the Davis family got me together\nwith him. Dr. Davis previously had often mistaken me for Charlie, and I\nwanted to find out whether that was a compliment or an insult. So, when\nCharlie came home to Omaha in 1959, the Davises arranged for us to go to\ndinner; in fact, I think we had a small little private room with a few Davises\nin attendance. Sometime during the evening, when Charlie started rolling\non the floor laughing at his own jokes, I knew I had met a kindred spirit. \n \nWhat was your first impression? \n \nMy first impression was that I had run into somebody that had a lot of\nsimilarities to me. I've been known to roll on the floor laughing at my own\nstuff, too, and to try to dominate the conversation. Charlie was a little more\nsuccessful at that than I've ever been, but he's been great to study under. \n \nThis is great. Now, here's your big one. What are the secrets of his success? \n \nWell, one time, some attractive woman sat next to Charlie and asked him\nwhat he owed his success to, and, unfortunately, she insisted on a one-word\nanswer. He had a speech prepared that would have gone on for several\nhours. But, when forced to boil it down to one word, he said that he was\n\"rational.\" You know, he comes equipped for rationality, and he applies it in\nbusiness. He doesn't always apply it elsewhere, but he applies it in business,\nand that's made him a huge business success. \n \nWhat other character traits do you think have contributed to his success?\n\f\nI think actually it really does come out of Ben Franklin that he admires so\nmuch. I mean, there is honesty and integrity, and always doing more than\nhis share and not complaining about what the other person does. We've been\nassociated for forty years, and he's never second-guessed anything I've\ndone. We've never had an argument. We've disagreed on things, but he's a\nperfect partner. \n \nWhat would you say are his most unusual characteristics? \n \nI would say everything about Charlie is unusual. I've been looking for the\nusual now for forty years, and I have yet to find it. Charlie marches to his\nown music, and it's music like virtually no one else is listening to. So, I\nwould say that to try and typecast Charlie in terms of any other human that I\ncan think of, no one would fit. He's got his own mold. \n \nLast question, what effect do you think Nancy has had on his life? \n \nI would have to say that Charlie is not looking for anyone to have an effect\non him, but that Nancy has done a remarkable job in spite of that fact. I\nwould hate to be a marriage broker with Charlie as a client. \n \nQ and A with Susie Buffett \n \nTell us about Warren and Charlie first meeting one another."

I think that\nWarren was an aberration in his family, Charlie perhaps was in his, and they\njust happened, luckily, to meet each other.\n\f\nWhat effect do you think Nancy has had on Charlie's life? \n \nI think it's obvious to everybody that Charlie's life is enhanced in every\naspect because of Nancy. She does things with such grace and humor and\ndignity. I'm like everyone else that knows this wonderful woman-I just\nrespect her, love her, and she's a phenomenal human being. I think if\nCharlie's had any good luck in his life, his ultimate luck was, and is,\nNancy. \n \nWarren was unenthusiastic about Charlie's continued practice of law. He\nsaid that while law might be a good hobby for Charlie, it was a far less\npromising business than what Warren was doing. Warren's logic helped\nCharlie to decide to quit law practice at the earliest point he could afford to\ndo so. \nWhen Charlie returned to Los Angeles, the conversations continued via\ntelephone and via lengthy letters, sometimes as long as nine pages. It was\nevident to both that they were meant to be in business together. There was\nno formal partnership or contractual relationship-the bond was created by a\nhandshake and backed by two Midwesterners who understood and\nrespected the value of one's word. \n \nThere were many benefits to their partnership: friendship, investment\nopportunities, and the unique ability to grasp each other's ideas and\nobservations. Later, the two organizations they headed were also\nbeneficiaries. As Warren was investing in and acquiring companies, he sent\nbusiness to Munger Tolles, a practice that allowed him over time to benefit\n\f\nfrom having one of the nation's top law firms at his disposal. Munger\nTolles, meanwhile, not only got Buffett's legal fees, but also gained because\nhis reputation attracted other blue-chip clients to the firm. \nMunger Tolles is not just about money, though. Mirroring the way charlie\nconducts his personal life, the firm has an enviable record of quietly\nproviding pro bono assistance to support groups for impoverished and\ndisadvantaged people in the Los Angeles community. To this day, Charlie\ncontinues to influence the firm's attorneys, reminding m, \"You don't need to\ntake the last dollar\" and \"Choose clients as you would choose friends.\" \n \nThough Charlie left the firm as an active partner in 1965 after only three\nyears, his indelible influence remains, as indelicate by the fact that his name\nstill heads the listing of 175 attorneys. when he left, he didn't take his share\nof the firm's capital. Instead, he directed that his share go to the estate of his\nyoung partner, Fred Warder, who left behind a wife and children when he\ndied of cancer. \n \nThere was no formal partnership or contractual relationship-the bond was\ncreated by a handshake and backed by two Midwesterners who understood\nand respected the value of one's word. \n \nTo this day, Charlie continues to influence the firm's attorneys, reminding\nm, \"You don't need to take the last dollar\" and \"Choose clients as you would\nchoose friends.\"\n\f\nCharlie's plan for financial Independence was soon working with great\nsuccess. He spent much time building asset base of Wheeler, Munger &\nCo., his investment partnership with Jack Wheeler. He also spent time\nworking on various real estate developments. All was going as planned,\nwith no significant reverses. At Wheeler, Munger, Charlie was investing in\nstocks partly with his own money and partly, with other people's money.\nCharlie concentrated more on putting his capital to work than in attracting\nnew clients. Because Jack Wheeler held two seats on the Pacific Coast\nStock Exchange, the partnership paid low trading commissions while\nWheeler, Munger kept the overhead cost at close to zero. \n \nAs time passed, Charlie and Warren kept up their frequent telephone\nconversations and letters, sharing ideas and investment concepts.\nSometimes they would agree to invest in the same company. Other times\nthey went different directions. In time, their independent portfolios had\noverlapping investments. Warren invested in the Blue Chip Stamp Co. and\nbecame the largest single shareholder. Charlie became the second largest\nshareholder, and, eventually, Berkshire Hathaway ended up acquiring the\ncompany. Charlie built the Wheeler, Munger partnership from 1962 through\n1975. It did exceptionally well for the first eleven years, compounding at\n28.3 percent gross (20.0 percent net) vs. 6.7 percent for the Dow, without a\nsingle down year. But the partnership was hit hard in the vicious bear\nmarket of 1973 and 1974 when it fell 31.9 percent and 31.5 percent in back-\nto-back years, as the partnership's largest holdings, Blue Chip Stamps and\nNew America Fund, fell sharply. This decline was despite, as Charlie puts\nit, \"having its major investments virtually sure of eventually being sale able\n\f\nat prices higher than the quoted market prices.\" But the partnership\nrebounded strongly in 1975, rising 73.2 percent, bringing the overall record\nover fourteen years to 19.8 percent (13.7 percent net) compounded annual\nreturns vs. 5.0 percent for the Dow. \n \nAfter this difficult experience, Charlie followed Warren in concluding that\nhe no longer wanted to manage funds directly for investors (Warren had\nclosed his own partnerships in 1969). Instead, they resolved to build equity\nthrough stock ownership in a holding company. When Wheeler, Munger\nwas liquidated, its stakeholders received shares in Blue Chip Stamps and\nDiversified Retailing. Later, these shares were converted into Berkshire\nHathaway stock, which ended 1975 at $38. Today, each share is worth more\nthan $85,000, making Charlie a member of the Forbes list of 400 wealthiest\nindividuals. While he doesn't mind the wealth, he regrets having his name\non any such list. Despite his healthy self-image, Charlie would prefer to be\nanonymous. \n \nWarren and Rick on \"Commodore Charlie\" \n \nWarren, why do you think Charlie built this enormous catamaran?\" \n\"Well, that the question that's been asked throughout the nautical world and,\nactually, there are two of us that know the answer to that. Rick Guerin and I\nhad an experience in Minnesota where, on a totally calm day, not a ripple on\nthe surface of the lake, Charlie managed to sink a boat with no outside help\nwhatsoever. As Rick and I went down for the third time, we shouted out to\nCharlie that the next time he should get a boat with a little more stability to\n\f\nit. 'We've decided that Charlie, with 3,400 square feet of surface area on his\nChannel Cat, may have finally found a boat that he can pilot with only a\nmoderate risk of sinking it single-handedly.\" \n \nRick Guerin adds: '.As I came up for the first time, it just so happened that I\nwas nose to nose with Warren. His eyes were as wide as saucers. It was\nonly after I rescued him that I realized I had missed an enormous\nopportunity namely, that the time to negotiate a reward for rescuing\nsomeone is before, not after' you save them. Who knows, with a little more\npresence of mind, maybe, just maybe, I would today be chairman of\nBerkshire Hathaway. By the way, I call Charlies catamaran 'Munger's Folly.'\nIt's the only completely irrational thing Charlie has ever done.\" Charlie gets\nthe last word: \"The boat was fun to design and build. 'What's irrational\nabout that?\" \n \nThe story of Berkshire Hathaway's extraordinary success under Warren and\nCharlie's leadership has been told many times elsewhere, so the details\nwon't be repeated here. To summarize, however, they have a spectacular\ntrack record of identifying undervalued companies and then either buying\nlarge stakes in the public markets or acquiring them outright. Regarding the\nlatter, they have acquired a diverse assortment of businesses such as Johns\nManville, the Buffalo Evening News, Flight Safety International, NetJets,\nShaw Carpet, Benjamin Moore Paint, GEICO, and Dairy Queen. In\naddition, they have purchased meaningful stakes in public companies such\nas The Washington Post, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and American Express. For\n\f\nthe most part, they have held their major investments for the long term-in\nfact, they still own almost every business they've ever acquired outright. \n\"That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,'but if you go\nthrough life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I\nthink it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's\nway better than just giving the basic concepts.\" \n \nCharlie's affinity for Benjamin Franklin's expansive career in government,\nbusiness, finance, and industry, can be found in his many speeches and\nwhenever he holds an audience, large or small. At the seventy-fifth\nanniversary of See's Candy, Charlie said, \"I am a biography nut myself.\nAnd I think when you're trying to teach the great concepts that work, it\nhelps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who\ndeveloped them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam\nSmith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent\ndead,'but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who\nhad the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better\nin education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.\" \n \nFranklin used his self-made wealth to achieve financial independence so he\ncould concentrate on societal \nimprovement. Charlie admires that trait in his mentor and strives to emulate\nFranklin. He has had long involvement with Good Samaritan Hospital and\nHarvard-Westlake School, both in Los Angeles, and has chaired the boards\nof each. He and Nancy have also long supported Stanford University and\nthe Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens in San\n\f\nMarino, California. They recently provided funding for a major expansion\nto the Huntington called the Munger Research Center (which will receive\nthe net proceeds of this book). Although Charlie is a self-described\nconservative Republican, chief among his causes is Planned \nParenthood. He believes that every child deserves to be born to a\nwelcoming mother. He also supports efforts to improve the environment\nand the quality of education. As the father of eight and grandfather of\nsixteen, Charlie regards his legacy as helping future generations inherit a\nbetter world. With his incisive wit and wisdom, Charlie Munger continues\nto be an invaluable partner to his best friend, Warren Buffett, and teacher to\nthe broader business world. Together, they have built one of the most\nsuccessful and widely admired companies in history. \n \nPraising Old Age \n \nMunger's Reflections on Aging, Inspired by Cicero's Discourse of Old-Age \n \nIn 1744, Ben Franklin was still a relatively unknown tradesman engaged in\nprinting in Philadelphia. At that time, he published, as a non-commercial\nlabor of love, a book containing the first American translation from Latin\ninto English of Cicero's de Senectute. Cicero had written this work, praising\nold age, in roughly the sixtieth year of his life. \nI first heard of this book in 2006 when I received from my friends, Angus\nand Lucy McBain, an exact reprint of Franklin's 1744 translation. It was\nentitled Cicero, on a Life well Spent (2005, Levenger Press). I practically\n\f\nwent into orbit upon seeing a work by Cicero that I could not recall ever\nhaving heard of, full of praise for old age. Perhaps the McBains figured I\nneeded an authoritative book explaining the many opportunities and\nconsolations still available to me at age 82. Whatever their motivations, the\nMcBains inspired the following reflections. \n \nI practically went into orbit upon seeing a work by Cicero...full of praise for\nof Age. \n \nwhen I first learned of Cicero while studying Latin at omaha central High at\nthe tail-end of the Great Depression, it did not seem sad to me that Cicero\nhad died shortly after the ending of the republican form of government he\nloved. \n \nAfter all, he would have soon died from some other cause. And all around\nme I could see that in some important sense Cicero had not fully died.\nIndeed, it was plain that Cicero dead had favorably influenced many more\npeople than Cicero living. This outcome was caused not by his martyrdom,\nbut by the preserved words of so great an author. Nor had his beloved\nrepublican form of government perished irretrievably. In fact, a form \nof government prescribed by Cicero surrounded me right there in Nebraska.\nMoreover, not only the form but also the trappings of Ciceronian\ngovernment were present. The architecture and statuary of Central High\nwere Greco-Roman in nature, reflecting the admirable desire of early\nNebraskans to give due credit to ancient models responsible for present\nfelicity.\n\f\nHis underlying philosophical view was one of deep and realistic cynicism\nabout human nature,., \n \nThe full merits of the peculiar form of government that Cicero had\nrecommended and Nebraska had adopted did not come through to me well\nat Central High, where I did not have an opportunity to study the Cicero\ntract that explained it. But I later came to share Cicero's governmental\nviews. What he recommended was a combination of aspects of limited-\nfranchise democracy, oligarchy and temporary kingship formed into an\nelaborate system of checks and balances designed to prevent any one\npolitician from causing unendurable damage. His underlying philosophical\nview was one of deep and realistic cynicism about human nature, including\na distaste for pure mob rule and demagogues. This cynicism was of course\ncounterbalanced try his belief that it was the duty of the citizenry,\nparticularly its most eminent members, to serve the State and its values\nwisely and vigorously, even if that required a great sacrifice on the part of\nthe servers. All ages have found that the duty part of this prescription is a\nhard sell. Indeed, Cicero in his own time found it necessary to invent the\nLatin word \"moralis,\" root of our word moral, to help flog his fellow\nRomans in the right direction. \n \nthat what moved me, in substantial part, was my recognition that in a value\nsystem like Cicero's I would be pretty likely to rise.\n\f\nAfter I came to share Cicero's political views, I fancied many times that I\nhad been converted out of concern for my fellow man. But now I believe\nthat a man seldom fully knows his own motives. Accordingly, I now think\nthat what moved me, in substantial part, was my recognition that in a value\nsystem like Cicero's I would be pretty likely to rise. \nAs it worked out, I got more out of life than I deserved. And the thought\npatterns that seem to be rewarded in one's life are usually those which end\nup as part of one's most incense convictions. And so I have come to like\nCicero better and better as the years have rolled by. At one time I even\nskimmed 'Trollope's biography of Cicero in the course of deciding never to\nrecommend it to anyone not already a Cicero addict. \nNotwithstanding the McBains' questionable social tact in giving an old man\na book on aging, their whole judgment was perfect. Cicero's talk would\nhave done me no good at Omaha Central High, where my main ambition\nwas to make a better impression on Shirley Smails. But in 2006 Cicero's\ndiscussion of old age met an enthusiastic reception. \nFor instance, the very first page lightened one of my, main burdens. There\nCicero reported that the \"thoughts that flowed on me ... in composing [this\nwork] ... proved so entertaining and delightful to me that ... they have\n[made] Old Age [appear] ... agreeable and comfortable.\" Here, obviously,\nspoke a man of my own kind, automatically entranced and convinced by his\nown words. I had long believed that I had a social defect in my tendency to\ngain enthusiasm in the course of telling others what I thought they should\nknow. After all, I often caused antipathy \nI could partially counteract only through being generous to an extent that\nwas sometimes irksome. Happily, the great Cicero described this trait as a\nhelpful virtue, easing the process of instructing the world. Precisely. But\n\f\nwhat are we to think of the high school that had this great man give me an\nextra paragraph or two on the Catiline conspiracy when he could have been\ntelling me to become more confident about my own words I suppose the\nanswer is that Central High was a pretty good place for its era or that many\nof my fellow students were so strong in self-regard that they didn't have my\nyouthful need for reassurance. \n \nCicero's words also increased my Personal satisfaction by supporting my\nlong-standing rejection of a conventional point of view. \n \nAs I continued through Cicero's pages, I found much more material\ncelebrating my way of life. As the years have passed, I have encountered\nmore and more criticism from being lost in my own thoughts when others\nwere talking to me. This behavior, too, is deemed a virtue by Cicero as he\ndemonstrates in his appraisal of the astronomer Gallus and others like him:\n\"How often did the rising sun surprise him, fixed on a calculation he began\novernight... and how many others we have known in their old age [so]\ndelighting themselves in their studies... ingenious and commendable?\" \n \nAnd cicero's words also increased my personal satisfaction by supporting\nmy long-standing rejection of a conventional point of view. I have always\nrefused to accept one interpretation of the Parable of the Pharisee and the\nPublican in the christian Bible. under this interpretation, a learned, pious\nman, after a long life spent doing his duty, is criticized for rejoicing that he\ndidn't end up like another man who behaved much worse and fell into a low\nmoral and worldly condition. Cicero, like me, is totally against refraining\n\f\nfrom enjoyment of this sort of delightful contrast. To him, pride in a job\nwell done is vastly constructive. For instance, it motivates good conduct in\nearly life because, in remembrance, you can make yourself happier when\nold. To which, aided by modern knowledge, I would add \"and, besides, as\nyou pat yourself on the back for behaving well, you will improve -your\nfuture conduct.\" \n \n...as you pat yourself on the back for behaving well, you will improve your\nfuture conduct. \n \nIn praise of the potentialities of advanced age, Cicero, for pages and pages,\nrecites great accomplishments of war, statecraft and literature by old and\neminent men who are made happy by performing so well for so long. For\nexample, he says of one of the great Scipios, \"Had his life been protracted a\nhundred years, can you suppose it would ever have proved burdensome to\nhim?\" \nIn the course of describing these instances of success in old age, Cicero\nsupplies interesting facts about the Roman political system. He has Cato\nsay: \"It was with great uneasiness to myself that, when Censor, I turned\nLucius Flaminius out of the Senate, seven years after he had been consul.\nBut I could not bear that his [killing a Gaul with his own hands merely to\namuse his favorite prostitute who missed seeing gladiatorial deaths in\nRome] should pass without public censure.\" Ah, those were the days! Given\nsuch Roman power, would not any wise person now approach the U.S.\nSenate with delight? And perhaps also publish a list of Senators under\nreview?\n\f\nMoreover, it is not enough for Cicero to praise the virtues of the old. He\nalso criticizes the defects and follies of the young. In one case he attributes\nthe destruction of a great government to the following cause: \"A parcel of\nyoung, raw and ignorant orators smarted up who took upon them to act as\nstatesmen and found means to insinuate themselves with and manage the\nPeople.\" \nCicero, learned men that he was, believed in self-improvement so long as\nbreathe lasts. \n \nCicero generally weighs the normal advantages of youth as inferior to the\nnormal advantages of age. To this end, he points out that Agamemnon in the\nwar on Soy \"never once wished for ten more men with the strength of Ajax\nbut, instead, wanted ten more with the wisdom of Nestor.\" \nThe age preference of Cicero is clearly attributable to his valuing, most\nhighly, strength of mind over strength of body. In one place he reports:\n\"Milo is said to have entered into the Olympic field carrying an ox on his\nback. Now, if the choice were given you, would you prefer Milo's strength\nof body or Pythagoras' ability of mind?\" To Cicero this is a rhetorical\nquestion with only one answer. \nCicero, learned man that he was, believed in self-improvement so long as\nbreath lasts. He commends Socrates for learning to play the fiddle late in\nlife and another Roman for mastering Greek when old. Indeed, according to\nCicero, the deaths of others that hurt the most are the ones of people you are\nlearning from. And so at one point he has Cato say of Quintus Fabius\nMaximus: \"I was so fond of hearing him speak [that] I ... feared that when\n\f\nhe was taken from us, I should never find another [such] man to improve\nby.\" And Cicero twice quotes with relish what was often said of Solon, the\ngreat man of early Athens: \"Daily learning something, he grew old.\" \nCicero counsels that the study of philosophy, in a lifelong search for basic\ncauses, is an ideal activity, usually serviceable for old people all the way to\nthe grave. \n \nHis praise of this form of learning is unstinting: \"We can never sufficiently\nadmire the excellences of Philosophy; to whose Dictates whosoever\nsubmits, he will never fail to find himself [easy] in any stage or condition of\nlife.\" When I reflected on Cicero's love of knowledge, as displayed above, I\nhappened to remember what I regard as Cicero's wisest and most cutting\ncritique of Rome, delivered without the need for a single word: When\nCicero was Quaestor in Sicily he sought for the grave of Archimedes, by far\nthe greatest mathematician of antiquity, and found it covered with thorns-a\nnatural, defective outcome in a Roman civilization that had almost no\ninterest in either mathematics or science. \n \nCicero counsels that the study of philosophy.., is an ideal activity, usually\nserviceable for old people all the way to the grave. \n \nAs might be expected in a work first published in America by Ben Franklin,\nCicero's discourse often supplies recommendations regarding all sorts of\nconduct, sometimes supported pithily by reasons. For instance, Cicero\nargues against miserly conduct by the elderly rich: \"Can anything be more\n\f\nsenselessly absurd than that the nearer we are to our journey's end, we\nshould still lay in more provision for it?\" \n \nAnd fear of death is silly and unacceptable for this Roman. He reasons that\neither (a) you are going to a perpetual, better afterlife, or (b) you won't\nretain any pain if there is no such outcome. \nTo Cicero it is unworthy that an old man would work to improve only what\nhe would live to enjoy. For him the only life worth living is dedicated in\nsubstantial part to good outcomes one cannot possibly survive to see. \n \nEarly retirement is criticized by Cicero as virtually unthinkable. He cites the\nmoral idea of Pythagoras that \"no man should quit his post but at the\ncommand of his General; that is, of God himself.\" \nIn general, Cicero did not appraise the last part of life as inferior,\nconstituting a poor residue of a better life when young. Not for Cicero is the\nattitude attributed to Lord Chesterfield who \"having drunk the cup of life\nthree quarters of the way to the bottom was now willing to share the dregs\nwith some wealthy woman.\" To Cicero, if you live right, the inferior part of\nlife is the early part. \n \nTo Cicero, if you live right, the inferior part of life is the early part. \n \nCicero believed in the display of great respect to elderly males. He thus had\nroughly the same good idea as Confucius. Moreover, he counsels old men\nto stand up for their rights: \"Old age is ever honorable when it takes care to\n\f\nsupport its proper rights and gives them not weakly away but asserts them\nto the last.\" \nCicero is never in favor of complaining about personal misfortune, and he\nhas reasons. For instance, he does not believe the old should complain\nabout diminutions in sexual vigor. Instead, he thinks they should rejoice that\nthey are now less likely to disgrace themselves or contract venereal\ndiseases. Thus Cicero found benefits in age similar to those discovered by\nan old friend of mine, here called \"Glotz.\" Just before he died at age 75, he\nsaid to me: \"I used to be troubled by unwelcome, lustful thoughts about my\nfriends' wives, but, by God, I finally licked it.\" However, Cicero is not\ncontent when everyone, at 75, is more like Glotz. Cicero, still in his early\nsixties, brags of his state in which \"voluptuous enjoyments\" seem inferior to\n\"oratory . . . and the Practice of Pleading.\" In this the great man may have\ngone too far in extrapolating a personal preference. Being the greatest\nlawyer in the world, he may have been misled by his own balance of\ntalents. Surely the rest of us, when still in our early sixties, will not very\noften prefer litigation as Cicero does. \n \nAs part of his opposition to complaining, Cicero points out how silly it is to\ncomplain of reaching old age. According to Cicero, the best a young person\ncan hope for is to get old before he dies, and it is not fitting to complain\nabout getting the best outcome you could have ever reasonably wanted. \nCicero, like Cato before him, concedes that, in moderation and meritorious\ncompany, the convivial imbibing of wine improves life. So also with stays\nat one's country place, well tended by others, a practice also favored by"

    "raw_text": "Jefferson, who shared Cicero's conviction that such states fostered sound\nvalues. \nThere is a judge-like objective balance in Cicero that makes him shade\nsome of his observations. He has someone ask Cato if his wonderful old age\ndoes not benefit from more than his moral attitude, to wit, if his old age has\nnot been benefited by his great success. Cato replies that some benefit\nprobably came \nfrom the success. \nIn reverse, while Cicero argues that handling a low worldly outcome with\nthe right morality and diligence is just as admirable as handling a high\noutcome, he concedes that abject poverty, if it comes, is inevitably going to\nmake aged life difficult. \nAccording to Cicero, the best a young person can hope for is to get old\nbefore he dies, But Cicero does not go so far as to concede that wealth will\nprotect the weak and improvident from misery. According to Cicero, the\nwealthy are sure to suffer if they are lacking in moral and providential skill. \nThe most celebrated passage in de Sertare is probably the following grand\nsummary: \"The best Armour of Old Age is a well spent life preceding it; \n \na Life employed in the Pursuit of useful Knowledge, in honorable Actions\nand the Practice of Virtue; in which he who labors to improve himself from\nhis Youth, will in Age reap the happiest Fruits of them; not only because\nthese never leave a Man, nor even in the extremist [sic] Old Age; but\nbecause a Conscience bearing Witness that our Life was well-spent,\ntogether with the Remembrance of past good Actions, yields an\nunspeakable Comfort to the Soul.\"\n\f\nFranklin left behind a full record of an old age that was among the most\nconstructive and happy ever lived.,. \n \nDo all these prescriptions of Cicero, if followed pretty well, really improve\nlife? Well, by a strange coincidence, Ben Franklin, the man who first\npublished them in America, followed the prescriptions as well as he could.\nAnd he lived a very long life, eminent to the end, and left behind a full\nrecord of an old age that was among the most constructive and happy ever\nlived. And this happened despite many disadvantages he suffered, medical\nand otherwise. \nAs usual, Ben Franklin improved what he found. Not satisfied with mere\ncheerful acceptance of an aged state, Franklin relisted the role of an old\nman and played it joyously to a fare-thee-well, while also laboring to help\ncreate what he could not possibly live to enjoy. Thus, these ideas of Cicero\nworked well for Franklin. \n \nAnd, no doubt, they will still work well for quite a few others. So there is a\nspecial reason, apart from Cicero's contributions to political science, in\nkeeping so many statues of Cicero in our public places. In this way Cicero\nis still being helpful more then two thousand years after Mark Antony tried\nto rid the world of his influence. \n \nMoreover, Warren Buffett, as a sort of modern baton carrier for a\nCiceronian point of view, is now doing a good job in intimating Cicero and\nFranklin in old age. Not only does Buffett, much like Cato, stay in the arena\nwith no plan to ever leave. He does so joyously and while providing good\n\f\nresults for those who will trust him patiently. And from a pulpit built high\nby worldly success, he also imitates Cicero, Cato and Franklin by\ncommunicating much that tells others what they should think and how they\nshould behave. \nAnd his words are often made more acceptable through use of insightful\nhumor. \n \nThis highly unusual case, I think, I should not cause all others to push so\nhard as Buffett does to follow almost every perception of Cicero. In the\nmodern world, with its increased wealth and longevity, a great many people\nlive in to gross impairment, and others while still in great condition are\nforced away from high worldly power when they have much life ahead of\nthem. Therefore some cheerful, non Buffett like adjustment to a reduced\nworldly role as usually sensible for the old. And, finally, It is wise for the\nmost didactic people to heed the warning, timed to George Bernard Shaw’s\ndeath, that the world rewards gadflies, but only a few, with those usually\nchosen because, like Shaw, they tempered morality with wit. \n \nFranklin on ageing \n \n\"I guess I don't so much mind being old, as I mind being fat and old. I\nshould have no objection to go over the same life from it's beginning to the\nend: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second\nedition the faults of the first. Life's Tragedy is that we get old too soon and\nwise too late. When you're finished changing you're finished.\""

He\ncontinued his career of inventing, writing, and statesmanship and more into\nold age, developing a phonetic alphabet at age 62. Five years later, he\npublished two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: \"Rules\nby Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One,\" and \"An Edict\nby the King of Prussia.\" In 1776 at age 70, Franklin assisted in writing the\nDeclaration of Independence, radically editing Jefferson draft. later that\nyear, he was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States\nand remained there until 1785. After his return, Franklin became an\nabolitionist, freeing both of his slaves and eventually becoming president of\nThe Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.

Munger Jr.\n\f\nOn the last day of a family ski vacation in Sun Valley when I was fifteen or\nso, my dad and I were driving back in the snow when he took a ten-minute\ndetour to gas the red jeep we were driving. He was pressed for time to have\nour family catch the plane home, so I was surprised to notice as he pulled\ninto the station that the tank was still half-full. I asked my dad why we had\nstopped when we had plenty of gas, and he admonished me: \"Charlie, when\nyou borrow a man's car, you always return it with a full tank of gas.\" \n \nMy freshman year at Stanford, an acquaintance lent me his car, more\nbecause friends we had in common twisted his arm than that he knew me all\nthat well. The tank was half-full, and the Audi Fox was red. So I\nremembered the jeep and topped the tank before I brought the car back. He\nnoticed. 'We've had a lot of good times since, and he stood as a groomsman\nat my Wedding. \n \nAfter Stanford. I learned that on that vacation we had been staying at Rick\nGuerin house and driving Rick Guerin's jeep. Rick is one of my dad's\nfriends who, on his return to Sun Valley, \ncertainly wouldn't have been troubled, and was unlikely even to notice, if\nhis jeep had less gas than when he left it. My dad still didn't skip a point of\nfairness and consideration. So I was taught that day not only how to get a\ngood friend, but also how to keep one. \n \nFamily Values at the Munger Dinner Table By Wendy Munger \nMy dad often used the forum of the Family dinner table to try to educate his\nchildren. His favorite educational tools were the Morality Tale, in which\n\f\nsomeone faced an ethical problem and chose the correct path, and the\nDownward Spiral Tale, in which someone made the wrong choice and\nsuffered an inevitable series of catastrophic personal and professional\nlosses. \nHis specialty was the Downward Spiral Tale. He could really warm to the\ntopic of apocalyptic consequences. He used such extreme and horrific\nexamples that we were often simultaneously groaning and laughing by the\ntime he finished. He's in a league of his own when it comes to describing\nnegative outcomes and the lessons to be learned from them. His Morality\nTheses were more straightforward. I remember the story my dad told his\nkids, then ranging from age five to twenty-five, about a financial officer at\none of his companies who made a mistake that resulted in the loss of\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to the company. As soon as this officer\nrealized his mistake, he went immediately to the president of the company\nand told him about it. My dad told us that the president then said, \"This was\na terrible mistake, and we don't want you ever to make another one like it.\nBut people make mistakes, and we can forgive that. You did the right thing,\nwhich was to admit your mistake. If you had tried to hide the mistake, or\ncover it up for even a short time, you would be out of this company. As it is,\nwe'd like you to stay.\" I think back on this story every time I hear of yet\nanother government official who chose to cover-up instead of the honest\nconfession after making a mistake. I don't know why I use the past tense in\ndescribing my dad's educational efforts at the dinner table. \nHis oldest children are heading toward their sixties, the table is now\ncrowded with grandchildren, and he's still using his distinctive style of\nstorytelling to keep us on the side of the angels. 'We're very lucky to have\nhim at the head of our table.\n\f\nFrom William H. (Hal) Borthwick \n \nIt has been a fascinating and wonderful fifty years (nearly) since Charlie\nand my mother were married. There were many opportunities that I offered\nCharlie for formative education. \n \nHere are a couple:  \n1. Do the job right the first time. \nThis story goes back to Minnesota times. One of my jobs as a driving-age\nteen was to pick up and deliver the housekeeper from the town of Cass\nLake. This wasn't just a drive down the street; the boat had to be driven\nacross the lake to the marina where I would hop into the car to drive to\ntown, and then the process was reversed. Part of the job in the morning was\nto pick up a newspaper while I was in town. 'Well, one day a big storm blew\nin rain, waves, wind, etc., big-time. filth all the excitement and difficulty, I\ndid get to town in the morning and returned with the maid, but forgot the\npaper. Charlie and I had a one-second or so discussion after I answered the\nquestion, \"'Where is my paper?\" in the negative. \"Go back and get the paper\nand never forget it again!\" So, back I went through the storm to get the\npaper, bouncing in the waves with rain sheeting off the boat, thinking to\nmyself that I wasn't going to allow anything like this ever to happen again. \n \n2. Be responsible.  \nCharlie's mother drove herself from Omaha to Minnesota each summer.\nWhen she was there, we used her car for errands. There was but one set of\n\f\nkeys, and while I was playing with friends in a sailing boat on the lake, the\nkeys fell out of my pocket into five feet of murky water. I went home and\nconfessed. Of course, in the Great North Woods, there aren't many\nlocksmiths, and with Charlie, there wasn't patience for such stupidity. The\nsolution, again in about a second, was: \"Go out with your friends and keep\ndiving till you get those keys, and don't come home without them.\" After\nabout two hours of diving, with the sun sinking like a stone, the miraculous\nglint of metal in the weeds was before my eyes, and I could go home. There\nare a lot of these gems from Minnesota because, in those days when Charlie\nworked so hard and so long, that was the only meaningful time we spent\nwith him. During the work weeks, he was off before dawn and home about\ndinner time and then studied Standard & Poor and, at late 6 would spend a\ncouple of hours on the phone with Warren. \n \nFrom David Borthwick \n \nMany years ago, Father decided our Minnesota lake cabin absolutely had to\nhave a tennis ball practice machine for the court that had been built a few\nyears earlier. While he certainly wanted the children to groove their\ngroundstrokes, there was a bit more to it than that. For it was Father who\nwas out on court more than anyone, with the machine positioned so he\ncould endlessly practice-volley close by the net. Before long, he mastered\nthe well-placed, easy put-away volleys, the kind of shots everyone else\ninstinctively tried to kill but usually hit into the net or ten feet out. By\nworking on the tennis version of golf's short game, which few others could\nbe bothered to practice, Father, as he's done throughout his life, gave"

Thank\nGod it was tennis, not business. Thinking about Father made me remember\na long-ago humorous TV beer ad in which a smartly dressed man at a table\nis so engrossed in his glass of beer as to be oblivious to a rampaging bull\ncharging a bullfighter right in front of him. He doesn't finch even when the\nbull smashes the table into matchsticks. The announcer's tagline was\n\"Try...beer for a truly unique experience,\" or something like that. Take away\nthe beer and substitute the financial market listings, architectural plans, or a\nscholarly biography of Keynes, and you have a dead-on comedic take on\nFather night after night in his favorite chair poring over something, all but\ndeaf to the roughhousing younger children, a blaring TV, and Mom trying to\nsummon him to dinner. Even when not reading, Father was often so deep in\ncontemplation that a routine drive to take Molly and Fendy back to\nPasadena could have turned into an excursion to San Bernardino without\nMom calling out the correct freeway turn offs. whatever was on his mind. it\nwasn't the outcome of a football game or a botched golf shot. Father's\nability to Chinese wall off the most intrusive distractions from whatever\nmental task he was engaged in-a practice alternately amusing and irritating\nif you were trying to get his attention -accounts as much as anything else\nfor his success. \n \nFrom Molly Munger  \n \n'When I went to college in 1966, I was very lucky to have been thoroughly\nsteeped in Daddy's influence. In an angry and radical era, I would buy the\n\f\nWall Street Journal or Fortune at the subway kiosk just outside the college\ngates, tuck it under my oxford cloth arm, and stride off to economics and\nbusiness classes. People were occupying the dean's office, going to jail. I\nwas in the basement of the Lamont Library learning how to read a balance\nsheet. Daddy raised us to be skeptical, even contrarian, and that was a\nparticularly helpful way of thinking to carry into the maelstrom of the late\nsixties. Over many years, sitting in the library at our house on June Street,\nhe had told us often funny stories of people who either followed the group\ntoo blindly or lashed out too reflexively. \"Crazy,\" \"maladjusted,\"\n\"pompous,\" \"self-satisfied\"-we knew from his adjectives what he thought\nwe should avoid. In Minnesota, he found a way to hard-wire the same\nmessage into our very bodies. He had arranged for the old Larson Boat\nWorks to make us an \"aquaplane,\" a heavy wooden affair we stood on as he\ntowed it behind the boat. He would make sharp turns to see if we could hold\non, and the only way to avoid the disgrace of a fall was to keep shifting\nweight to compensate for the extreme angles. Then, and on into the future, I\nwould always be viscerally terrified if it seemed any thought or activity was\ngetting out of hand in one direction or another. When I was in college,\nDaddy had seven other children to raise, worked in a seedy part of Spring\nStreet, and owned but one company, a small, grimy outfit that made motor\nadditive. But he saw these were unhinged times. He sent me the allowance\nof a much richer father, keeping me in professionally ironed shirts and\nmaking me feel sharp as a bandbox. From 3,000 miles away, he continued\nto help me keep my balance. I could go on. Suffice it to say that our father\nhas always known what he was doing, as a parent as in so much else. I\nappreciated it greatly. I still do.\n\f\nFrom Emilie Ogden \n \n\"You have your father's hands,\" my husband remarked out of the blue, as\nwe shared a glass of wine. I looked at him, a little stunned, not by tire\ncomparison, but by his telepathy. I had been devising a short piece about\nmy father, and the very subject had been on my mind. I had already noticed\nthat my oldest son's hands are like his grandfather, with fingertips slightly\nsquare, and nail beds shaped like tea cups rather than ovals. But it's\nsomething about the way our hands take positions that first sparks the\ncomparisons. My father, my son, and I all cross our hands behind us in the\nsame distinct manner, the left hand holding the wrist of the right, as we\nwalk, minds elsewhere. \"'What is it about my hands, exactly, that reminds\nyou of my father's?\" I asked. \"It's in the where your index finger curves into\nyour thumb,\" he said, showing me. \"It's the way you hold things there.\" My\nfather is holding his hands out above me. His fingers are curled, and his\nthumbs are pointing at each other, like handles on a bike. I reach my girl\narms up straight, and I grasp each of his thumbs as he lifts me off the\nground. I hang on delighted until my strength is spent. And when one child\nis too big for \"thumbs,\" there is always another, on down through the line of\ngrandchildren. \n \nSometimes we'd get him to put down the Wall Street Journal and play\n\"sandwich.\" As he sits in the green armchair in the library we pile on like\nthe bacon, lettuce, and tomato of a BLT, his hands squeezing us together in\na multilayered hug. My father holds a perfect chicken egg. 'We've won the\nfather-daughter egg toss, earning me one of my favorite possessions: a\n\f\nmarble cube sprouting gilt acanthus leaves, with a life-size golden replica of\nan egg on top. This trophy sits on my desk, reminding me of the sunny day\nwhen my dad was so present and so gentle as to keep a flying egg from\nbreaking in either of our hands.\n \nMy father's hands know the tensile strength of different fishing lines by\nfeel. They tie on a chartreuse jig or a plain old hook. His hands rise to his\nlips where he catches his knots with his teeth and bites off the extra line.\nHis hands get wet reaching into tin bait buckets. They pinch twisting black\nleeches or one of Leroy's famous minnows, \"guaranteed to catch fish, or die\ntrying.\" His hands hold yellow-green Zingers, pickles so spicy-hot a bite\nwill bring a laugh, and peanut butter mustard sandwiches.\n \nMy father's hands rise early, with the rest of him, and appear at the edges of\nthe business pages. In Minnesota, he might crumple this newsprint into\nloose balls, build kindling pyramids, strike long hearth matches, and press\nspade-shaped wooden bellows. With the fire lit, he might cook blueberry\nbuckwheat pancakes on the Ben Franklin wood stove, using an old wood-\nhandled spatula with chipped red paint. \n \nBut if you play Password and give the clue \"Charlie Munger hands,\"\nanyone will first answer, \"books.\" No matter where he is, his hands are\nalways holding open a volume, typically a Ben Franklin biography, or the\nlatest treatise on genetics. One might also answer \"graph paper,\" for the\nbuildings he's been designing. 'when I think of my father hands, I also see\nthem up on stage, in front of thousands in Omaha every year. His fingers\nencircle a Diet Coke, pinch peanut brittle or the stick of a Dilly Bar, or try\n\f\nto search incognito through a See's Candies' box, zeroing in on the rum\nnougat. His hands are crossed in front of him, as he shakes his head saying,\n\"I have nothing to add.\" Or they move to the rhythm of a longer\nphilosophical answer, making all the hands in the stadium clap together. \n \nMy father's hands, gesturing alongside every colorful joke and guiding story\nhave molded me as surely as a sculptor. I can be nothing but glad, and\ngrateful, for the touch of my father's hands in mine. and in my son's. \n \nFrom Barry Munger \n \nSeveral years ago, I came across a book by Calvin Trillin called Messages\nfrom My Father, a memoir about Trillin's father, Abe, who was born in the\nUkraine, grew up in Missouri, and spent much of his career operating\nneighborhood grocery stores in Kansas City. Abe Trillin regarded thrift as a\nmoral virtue, paid his bills the day they arrived, and got up at four in the\nmorning, six days a week, to pick the produce for his stores. A man of few\nwords, he was nevertheless convivial, trenchandy funny, and spoke\nnaturally to small children. He was skilled at cards. He was sardonic, but\nhad an underlying optimism that one could get along in the world with the\nproper outlook and character. \n \nThe fact that my father shares many of these qualities, even if he’s not\nknown for his discernment about produce, does not fully explain my\nattachment to this light, deft, and anecdotal little book. Reading it somehow\nconjures my father for me, even though in the broad outlines of his life, my\n\f\nfather has almost nothing in common with Abe Thillin, other than the fact\nthat my father once worked part-time at a Midwestern grocery store, Buffett\n& Son in Omaha. \n \nLike my father, Abe Thillin had a fundamental reserve, partially\nMidwestern in origin, that was at odds with his personable qualities. He did\nnot regard a long drive in a car or a fishing outing as an opportunity to\n\"catch up.\" He did not linger on the telephone. His son eventually came to\nmarvel at \"how much my father managed to get across to me without those\nheart-to-hearts that I've read about fathers and sons having in the study or in\nthe rowboat or in the car.\" The title Message from My Father comes from\nthe author's surmise that his father must have been communicating his\nexpectations through coded messages. \"It's possible that my father had a\ncode so subtle that I didn't know of its existence,\" he writes. \n \nAnyone who knows my father knows that his manner of expression is not\nalways subtle, but he has many ways of sending his messages. If he doesn't\nlike the way his bridge partner plays out a hand, for example, he might say,\n\"You played that like a plumber,\" but if he wants to offer serious counsel to\none of his children, he is more likely to couch the message in an anecdote,\npreferably delivered in a group setting so that no one is singled out. In both\ninstances, he appears blunt and avuncular-that inimitable Charlie-but at the\ncard table, he uses a lack of indirection for harmless ribbing, and at the\ndinner table, he uses indirection to spare feelings. He is more subtle than he\nappears.\n\f\nA friend of mine recently began an anecdote about my father by saying, \"So\nyour dad's sitting in his chair, like Rushmore....\" I knew exactly what he\nmeant. Not many people can summon up the image of a 5,700-foot granite\nmountain and the faces of four presidents simply by taking possession of an\nupholstered chair, but my father can. All of the Munger children have at one\ntime or another approached Rushmore to make a request and felt like\nDorothy approaching Oz, except that Oz was more voluble. Rushmore did\nnot always respond. Sometimes my father made a low steady noise from\nsomewhere around his larynx, as though Rushmore had gone volcanic, but\nthat was not so easy to interpret. Can you be more subtle than silent? \n \nUnlike Abe Trillin, perhaps, my father really does send messages, in the\nform of speeches he has written, letters he has received and sent, and\narticles from varied sources about social policy, psychology, business\nethics, and law, among other topics. Many of them appear in this book.\n'What does not appear is the note my father scrawled on the enclosure. The\nnote is usually extremely brief, and often just a \"send to\" list, but every\nonce in a while the note will have a wry fillip, like this one from 1996,\nwhich was appended to a long appreciative letter from a Berkshire\nHathaway shareholder in Sweden. \"I hope you find this amusing,\" my\nfather wrote. \"If only I had the influence with my wife and children that I\nhave in some other quarters!\" \n \nWhen I finished the Tirillin book, I sent it to my father. Even if he did not\nrecognize himself in it, I figured he would enjoy the book's Midwestern\nmilieu, the immigrant striving of the Trillin family, and the humor. The\nbook is written with so much affection that I thought I could even use it to\n\f\ncommunicate such feelings to my dad indirectly, which is the preferred\nroute. At the very least, I thought the book might reassure my father that his\nmessages were being received, even if they were not always heeded. \n \nAbout a week later, the book came back, in a padded envelope, with an\naddress label supplied by his secretary. There was no note, so I wasn't sure\nwhether he had read the book or rejected it. It seemed untouched, so I\nconcluded that my message had gone unreceived, loose pages tossed on\nRushmore. Not much escapes my father, however. It turned out that he had\nsimply instructed his secretary to send copies to the whole family. \n \nFrom Philip Munger \n \nSome of my most affectionate memories of my father are of shopping for\nclothes at Brooks Brothers and Marla and Spencer. Most people already\nknow that Father is not a big fashion man. He once said that he was\nnonconformist enough in his behavior and opinions that it made sense to\nchart a very straight course in attire. His going along with normal social\ncustoms and his sense of humor, he said. were what allowed his otherwise\nsometimes prickly temperament to harmonize with other people. \n \nI vividly recall going with my Father to Brooks Brothers, when it was still\nhoused in that beautiful old wood-paneled building in downtown Los\nAngeles, to buy my first serious suit. I must have been about eleven or\ntwelve. I can see those polished brass elevator doors opening. We looked\nthrough the racks. Father picked out a pin-striped charcoal grey suit. When\n\f\nI was sixteen, we went to buy another suit, this time a three-piece, which I\nwore religiously during my debate days. It kept the icy wind blowing off the\nlake at Northwestern, during a tournament, at bay. 'We bought, at the same\ntime, a pair of wing-tip shoes for my summer stint at the Daily Journal (a\ncoming of age ceremony required by Father for each boy), shoes which\nhave lasted till this day. There is another theme here. When we bought a\nbrown tweed coat at Marks and Spencer in London, Father said, \"This will\nalways keep its crease.\" He admired both stores because they were durable\ninstitutions and because their merchandise was, too, and fairly priced.\nDurability has always been a first-rate virtue in my father review, along\nwith ritual and tradition. He never had a desire to change his primary habits,\nsartorial or otherwise, once he had, like Franklin, acquired them. \n \nI still shop at Brooks, partly because each year at Christmas Father gives\nevery child a gift card, which is perfectly timed for the winter sale. But I\nalways end up going more often than that. One year, I used his largess to\npurchase trousers with pleats. My father looked at them askance and said,\n\"Do you want to look like a jazz drummer?\" In New York, Brooks is still\nhoused in its grand old building. I think of my father every time I go; I'm\nvery attached to the place. 'When I went to study at Oxford, in winter 1988,\nhe gave me an old Brooks coat of his, dating from the forties, of a sort of\ntannish-olive hue, I think, with a warm zip-in lining. As I walked home\nfrom the Bodleian Library each night, that nasty damp penetrating English\ncold would not get through. When I returned to the United States, I realized\nI had left the coat on a bus. I wept at the loss. Even now I wish I had that\ncoat.\n\f\nFriends Have Their Say:  \n \n\"Charlie's Smart, Curious, Focused...and a Little Absentminded.\" \n\"We all have our little quirks-my family and friends tell me I'm sometimes\nabsent minded and opinionated. Maybe they're right.\" \n \nRoy Tolles, friend and business associate since 1945 \nCharlie has a desire to understand exactly what makes things happen. He\nwants to get to the bottom of everything, whether it's something of serious\ninterest to him or not. Anything that comes to his attention, he wants to\nknow more about it and understand it and figure out what makes it tick.\" \n \nGlen Mitchel. Friend since 1957 \nHe knows how to take all of his brains and all of his energy and all of his\nthought and focus exactly on a single problem, to the exclusion of anything\nelse. People will come into the room and pat him on the back or offer him\nanother cup of coffee or something, and he won't even acknowledge their\npresence because he is using one hundred percent of his huge intellect.\" \n \nBob Bird, President,'Wesco Financial, Friend and business associate\nsince 1969 \nWhen he is in deep thought he often loses what is going on around him\nincluding social niceties. I remember that when we were negotiating with\nCenFed to have them take over our savings and loan business, Charlie and I\nwent over to their offices to meet with their CEO, Tad Lowrey. We had a\nperfectly wonderful meeting-Charlie can put on the charm if he puts his\n\f\nmind to it-and we were winding things up very satisfactorily. 'Tad walked\nus to the elevator. Just as we got there, the elevator door opened, and\nCharlie walked directly inside. He never said goodbye, never shook hands,\nnothing. Tad and I were left standing there, smiling and speechless.\" \n \n'Warren Buffett, friend and partner since 1959 \nI was in New York City with Charlie to attend a Salomon Brothers board\nmeeting. 'We had come out of the building and were standing on the\nsidewalk, discussing what had transpired at the meeting. At least, that's\nwhat I thought we were doing, for suddenly I realized that I had been\ntalking to myself for some time. I looked around for Charlie, only to see\nhim climbing into the back of a taxicab, headed off to the airport. No\ngoodbye, no nothing. \n \n\"People think it's Charlie’s eyes that cause him to miss seeing things\n(Charlie lost his vision in one eye many years ago due to complications\nfrom cataract surgery). BUT IT'S NOT HIS EYES, IT'S HIS HEAD! I once\nsat through three sets of traffic lights, and plenty of honking behind us, as\nCharlie discussed some complex problem at an intersection.\" \n \nDick Esbenshade, friend and business associate since 1956 \nWhen it comes to being curious and focused, when Charlie gets interested\nin something, he REALLY gets interested in it. I remember three talks he\nprepared and presented to our law firm on some of what he referred to as\n'the eminent dead’ he had encountered through his extensive reading: Isaac\nNewton, Albert Einstein, and Simon Marks. In particular, I remember the\n\f\ncentral message of the talk on Simon Marks (of retailer Marks and\nSpencer): 'Find out what you're best at and keep pounding away at it.' This,\nof course, has always been Charlie's basic approach to life.\" \n \nHoward Buffett, son of 'Warren BufFett and friend of Charlie's since\n1959 \nFor  years, I would see Charlie at our Southern California beach house. I\nremember having \n'conversations' that were essentially one-sided, feeling like I should have a\ndictionary at my side to look up all the words I didn't understand. I\nremember not saying much, being scared to ask a question and appearing\nstupid. He is so darned smart, like my father, in the stratosphere. \n\"I've been quoted in the past (out of context, of course) as saying my father\nis the second smartest person I've ever known, Charlie being the first. To\nkeep peace in my family, I have no comment on such reports.\" \n \nAnd Bill Gates has to Say: \n \nBen Franklin once said I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the\nInfinite Father, expects or requires no worship or praise from us, but that He\nis even infinitely above it.' \n \n\"I think the same can be said of Charlie Munger-despite any accolades from\nme or others in this book he will still be his own best critic as well as the\nperson who appreciates his own jokes the most. \"Warren told me before I\n\f\nmet Charlie that he was the most amazing business partner a man could\nhave. He also warned me not to expect to get a word in edgewise when\ntalking to Charlie because even at a cocktail party Charlie would hold his\nhand up to prevent others from starting to speak while he took a drink. \"He\nalso warned me that Charlie might not be the best person to choose as a\nboat captain, relating a story where he managed to sink a boat in a totally\ncalm lake with no other traffic by going full speed in reverse with a low\ntransom on the stern. \n \n\"Charlie exceeded even the high expectations that Warren set. He is truly\nthe broadest thinker I have ever encountered. From business principles to\neconomic principles to the design of student dormitories to the design of a\ncatamaran he has no equal. \"Our most memorable correspondence was\nabout stock options and their power to distort business results. Our longest\ncorrespondence was a detailed discussion on the mating habits of naked\nmole rats and what the human species might learn from them.  \n\"Charlie has the ability to capture knowledge with simple descriptions.\n'When discussing the intelligence of offspring, he refers to the 'genetic\nlottery.' 'When discussing venture capitalists who defend stock options, he\ndeems them 'no better than the piano player in a whorehouse.' 'When\ndiscussing the deleterious effects on efficiency of cost-plus contracts, he\nlikes to say even the mule knew to slow down.' \"This book capturing\nCharlie's wisdom is long overdue.\""

    "raw_text": "Chapter 2\n \nThe Munger Approach to Life, Learning,\nand Decision Making \n \n\"Take a simple idea and take it seriously.\" \n \nDespite being largely self-taught, Ben Franklin was spectacularly successful\nin such diverse fields as journalism, publishing, printing, philanthropy,\npublic service, science, diplomacy and inventing. Much of Franklin's\nsuccess was due to the essential nature of the man-most especially his\nappetite for hard work but also his insatiable curiosity and patient\ndemeanor. Above all, he possessed a quick and willing mind that enabled\nhim to easily master each new field of endeavor he chose to undertake. It is\nnot surprising that Charlie Munger considers Franklin his greatest hero, for\nMunger is also largely self-taught and shares many of Franklin's unique\ncharacteristics. Like Franklin, Charlie has made himself into a grandmaster\nof preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity. He has played these\nattributes into great success in both his personal and business endeavors,\nespecially in his investing. \n \nTo Charlie, successful investing is simply a byproduct of his carefully\norganized and focused approach to life. Warren Buffett once said, \"Charlie\ncan analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than\n\f\nany man alive. He sees any valid weakness in sixty seconds. He is a perfect\npartner.\" Why does Buffett proffer such high praise? The answer lies in the\nmarkedly original approach Munger applies to life, learning, and decision\nmaking the principal subject of this overview. A word to the wise before we\nbegin: Given the complexity of Charlie's approach, what follows is not\nintended as a \"how-to\" lesson for the aspiring investor. Instead, it is a\ngeneral overview of \"how he seems to do it.\" Our goal here is to present the\nbasic outline of Charlie's approach to prepare you for the voluminous\ndetails that follow in the rest of the book. If you are anxious to get to the\nheart of the matter, the \"Mungerisms: Charlie Unscripted\" and \"Eleven\nTalks\" sections-presented verbatim in Charlie's own words-are the best\nsource for exacting \"how-to\" advice on a broad range of topics. Here we\nwill content ourselves with a presentation of the general thought processes\nCharlie employs when considering an investment, followed by an outline of\nhis guiding investment principles. \n \nMunger's \"Multiple Mental Models\" Approach to Business Analysis and\nAssessment \"You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use\nthem routinely-all of them, not just a few. Most people are trained in one\nmodel-economics, for example-and try to solve all problems in one way.\nYou know the old saying: 'To the man with a hammer, the world looks like a\nnail.' This is a dumb way of handling problems.\" \n \nCharlie's approach to investing is quite different from the more rudimentary\nsystems used by most investors. instead of making a superficial stand-alone\nassessment of a company's financial information, Charlie conducts a\n\f\ncomprehensive analysis of both the internal workings of the investment\ncandidate as well as the larger, integrated \"ecosystem\" in which it operates.\nhe calls the tools he uses to conduct this review \"Multiple Mental Models.\"\nThese models, discussed at length in several of the Talks (especially\nnumbers Two, Three, and Four), serve as a framework for gathering,\nprocessing, and acting on information. They borrow from and really stitch\ntogether the analytical tools, methods, and formulas from such traditional\ndisciplines as history psychology , mathematics, engineering. biology,\n physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and so The unassailable logic of\nCharlie's \"ecosystem\" approach to investment analysis: just as just as\nmultiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a variety\nof disciplines, applied with fluency are needed to understand the system. As\nJohn Muir observed about the interconnectedness of nature , when we try to\npick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the\nuniverse. \n \n“you have to realize the truth of biologists Julian Huxley's idea that life is\njust one damn relatedness after another so you must have mental models\nand you must see the relatedness and the effects from the relatedness.\" \n \nCharlie seeks to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment\ncandidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant\nfactors comprising both its internal and external environment. When\nproperly collected and organized, his Multiple Mental Models (about one\nhundred in number, he estimates) provide a context or \"latticework\" that\nleads to remarkable insights as to the purpose and nature of life. More\n\f\npertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that\nenables him to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex\ninvestment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. Especially\nimportant examples of these models include the redundancy/backup system\nmodel from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics,\nthe breakpoint/ tipping-moment/autocatalysis models from physics and\nchemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology)', and\ncognitive misjudgment models from psychology. \n \nThe net result of this broad-spectrum analysis is a heightened understanding\nfor how the many factors affecting an investment candidate blend and link\nto one another. Sometimes this understanding reveals the existence of\nsecond order, \"ripple,\" or \"spillover\" effects. Other times the factors\nemployed combine to create enormous \"Lollapalooza level results,\" good or\nbad. By applying this framework. \n \nT.H.E  L.O.L.L.A.P.A.L.O.O.Z.A  E.F.F.E.C.T \"Of course, the term Munger\nhas coined for factors which reinforce and greatly amplify each other is\n'Lollapalooza Effect.\"' \n \n\"The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big\nforces often come out of these one hundred models. when several models\ncombine, you get lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces\nare all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don't get simple\naddition. Its often like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear\nexplosion if you get to a certain point of mass-and you don't get anything\n\f\nmuch worth seeing if you don't reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just\nadd like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or\ncritical-mass basis. \n\"More commonly, the forces coming out of these one hundred models are\nconflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable trade offs. But if\nyou can't think in terms of trade offs and recognize tradeoffs in what you\nare dealing with, you're a horse's patoot. You clearly are a danger to the rest\nof the people when serious thinking is being done. You have to recognize\nhow these things combine. And you have to realize the truth of biologist\nJulian idea that 'Life is just one damn relatedness after another.' So you\nmust have the models, and you must see the relatedness and the effects from\nthe relatedness.\" \n \nMultiple Mental Models \n \n\"I'll Do It Myself” \nWhen my friend Buffett and I left our respective graduate schools, we\nfound huge predictable patterns of obvious extreme irrationality in the\nbusiness world. This irrationality was grossly important in what we were\ntrying to do, yet it had never been mentioned by our professors. Our\nsolution' one we learned at a very early age in the nursery: \"'Then I'll do it\nmyself,\" said the Little Red Hen.' \"So if your professors won't give you an\nappropriate multidisciplinary approach, if each wants to overuse his own\nmodels and underuse the important models in other disciplines, you can\ncorrect that folly yourself.\"\n\f\nWisdom Reaffirmed \nMunger and Buffett aren't the only elite investors who use non business\nmodels to superb success. Legendary fixed income expert Bill Gross\n(PIMCO) once told the students of the UCLA Anderson School of\nBusiness: \"The book that rests on my library coffee table is not Peter Lynch\nBeating the Street or even my own, but several books by historian Paul\nJohnson on the makings of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \n\"There is no better teacher than history in determining the future.... There\nare answers worth billions of dollars in a $30 history book. \n \nParticularly in Talks Two, Three, and Four, Charlie lectures on the value\nand importance of using multiple models in business. He explains where he\nfound his unique models and how he mastered them, and he cites specific\nexamples of their application in real-world analysis and decision making. \n \nCharlie lives in a different world from the most investors when it comes to\nInvestment analysis his approach accept the reality that investment\nproblems are inherently complex and in a many more in keeping with the\nrigors of scientific enquiry than conventional investing he attacks them with\na staggering degree of preparation and broad based research. \n \nCharlie big ideas from the big disciplines approach two investment\nevaluation is certainly unique in the business world as its origin not finding\nany adequate approach to the task Charlie painstakingly created his own\nlargely self taught system the self-taught statement is no exaggeration to\nthis day I have never taken any course anywhere in chemistry economics\n\f\npsychology or business he once said. And yet these disciplines specially\npsychology form the foundation upon which is system is built \n \nIt is this signature approach back by Charlie's formidable intellect,\ntemperament and decades of relevant experience, that have made him the\nvirtuoso of business pattern recognition so valued by Buffett. Like a chess\ngrandmaster, throUgh logic, instinct, and intuition, he determines the most\npromising investment \"models,\" all the while projecting the illUsion that\nthe insight came easily,., even simple. But make no mistake: This\n\"simplicity\" comics only at the end of a long journey, towards\nunderstanding-not at the beginning. His clarity is hard won: the product of a\nlifetime of studying the patterns of human behavior, business systems, and a\nmyriad of other scientific disciplines. \nCharlie counts preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity among his\nmost fundamental guiding principles. He will not deviate from these\nprinciples, regardless of group dynamics, emotional itches, or popular\nwisdom that \"this time around it's different.\" When faithfully adhered to,\nthese traits result in one of the best-known Munger characteristics: not\nbuying or selling often! often. Munger, like Buffett, believes a successful\ninvestment career boils down to only a handful of decisions. So when\nCharlie likes a business, he makes a very large bet and typically holds the\nposition for a long period (see Warren Buffett's analysis of the original\n1962-1975 Munger partnership on page 21). Charlie calls it \"sit on your ass\ninvesting\" and cites its benefits: \"You're paying less to brokers, you're\nlistening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra\none, two, or three percentage points per annum.\" In his view, a portfolio of"

    "raw_text": "three companies is plenty of diversification. Accordingly, Charlie is willing\nto commit uncommonly high percentages of his investment capital to\nindividual \"focused\" opportunities. Find a Wall Street organization,\nfinancial advisor, or mutual fund manager willing to make that statement! \n \nGiven Charlie's record of success, not to mention Buffett's endorsement,\nwhy aren't his investment practices more routinely emulated by others?\nPerhaps the answer is that, for most people, Charlie's multidisciplinary\napproach is simply too hard. Further, few investors share Charlie's\nwillingness to appear foolish by not following \"the herd.\" Religious in his\nobjectivity, Charlie is content to swim imperturbably against the tide of\npopular opinion-indefinitely, if necessary-which is a rare attribute in the\naverage investor. And while this behavior can at times appear simply\nstubborn or contrarian, that is not the defining characteristic. Charlie is\nsimply content to trust his own judgment even when it runs counter to the\nwisdom of the herd. This \"lone-wolf' aspect of Charlie's temperament is a\nrarely appreciated reason why he consistently outperforms the larger\ninvestment community. Indeed, if temperament chiefly arises from inborn\ntendencies, it may be that hard work, intellect, and experience, regardless of\ntheir intensity, are by themselves insufficient to make a great investor like\nCharlie Munger. As we shall witness throughout the remainder of this book,\nthe right kind of genetically predetermined \"wiring\" is needed as well. \n \nDiscipline and Patience Ted Williams' Seventy-Seven Cell Strike Zone\n\f\n\"It takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing. I didn't get\nto where I am by going after mediocre opportunities.\" \n \n\"In making investments, I have always believed that you must act with\ndiscipline whenever you see something you truly like. To explain this\nphilosophy, Buffett/Munger like to use a baseball analogy that I find\nparticularly illuminating, though I myself am not at all a baseball expert.\nTed Williams is the only baseball player who had a .400 single-season\nhitting record in the last seven decades. In the Science of Hitting he\nexplained his technique. He divided the strike zone into seventy-seven cells,\neach representing the size of a baseball. He would insist on swinging only\nat balls in his 'best' cells, even at the risk of striking out, because reaching\nfor the 'worst' spots would seriously reduce his chances of success. As a\nsecurities investor, you can watch all sorts of business propositions in the\nform of security prices thrown at you all the time. For the most part, you\ndon't have to do a thing other than be amused. Once in awhile, you will find\na 'fat pitch that is slow, straight, and right in the middle of your sweet spot.\nThen you swing hard. This way, no matter what natural ability you start\nwith, you will substantially increase your hitting average. One common\nproblem for investors is that they tend to swing too often. This is true for\nboth individuals and for professional investors operating under institutional\nimperatives, one version of which drove me out of the conventional\nlong/short hedge fund operation. However, the opposite problem is equally\nharmful to long-term results: You discover a fat pitch' but are unable to\nswing with the full weight of your capital.\"\n\f\nAt the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, a young shareholder\nasked Buffett how to succeed in life. After Buffett shared his thoughts,\nCharlie chimed in: : \"Don't do cocaine. Don't race trains. And avoid AIDS\nsituations.\" Many would dismiss his seemingly flippant answer as merely\nhumorous (which it certainly was), but in fact it faithfully reflects both his\ngeneral views on avoiding trouble in life and his particular method for\navoiding missteps in investing. \n \n\"'When Warren lectures at business school, be says, 'I could improve your\nultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it so\nthat you had 20 punches representing all the investments that you get to\nmake in a lifetime and once you had punched through the card you could\nnot make any more investments at all under those rules you would really\nthink carefully about what you did and you would be forced to load up on\nwhat you would really thought about. So you'd do so much better” \n \nOften, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid-that\nis, on what NOT to do-before he considers the affirmative steps he will take\nin a given situation. \"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll\nnever go there\" is one of his favorite quips. In business as in life, Charlie\ngains enormous advantage by summarily eliminating the unpromising\nportions of \"the chessboard,\" freeing his time and attention for the more\nproductive regions. Charlie strives to reduce complex situations to their\nmost basic, unemotional fundamentals. Yet, within this pursuit of rationality\nand simplicity, he is careful to avoid what he calls \"physics envy,\" the\ncommon human craving to reduce enormously complex systems (such as\n\f\nthose in economics) to one-size-fits-all Newtonian formulas. Instead, he\nfaithfully honors Albert Einstein's admonition, \"A scientific theory should\nbe as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" Or in his own words, \"What I'm\nagainst is being very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that\nyour particular action will do more good than harm. You're dealing with\nhighly complex systems wherein everything is interacting with everything\nelse.\" \n \nAnother Benjamin-Graham, not Franklin-played a significant role in\nforming Charlie's investing outlook. One of the most enduring concepts in\nGraham's The Intelligent Investor is Mr. Market. Usually, Mr. Market is a\ntemperate and reasonable fellow, but some days he is gripped by irrational\nfear or greed. Graham cautioned the investor to carefully use his own,\nunemotional judgment of value instead of relying on the often manic-\ndepressive behavior of the financial markets. Similarly, Charlie recognizes\nthat even among the most competent and motivated of people, decisions are\nnot always made on a purely rational basis. For this reason, he considers the\npsychological factors of human misjudgment some of the most important\nmental models that can be applied to an investment opportunity: \n \n\"personally I had gotten so that I now use a kind of to track analysis first\nwhat are the factors that really govern the interest involved rationally\nconsiders? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the\nbrain at subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various\nways which, by and large comma are useful but which open malfunction?\nWhen approaches rationality the way you would work out a bridge problem\n\f\nby evaluating the real interest the real probabilities and so forth and the\nother is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious\nconclusions many of which are wrong.\" \n \nMunger's Investment Evaluation Process \n \n\"The number one idea is to view a stock as an ownership of[ the business\nand to judge the staying quality of the business in terms of its competitive\nadvantage. Look for more value in terms of discounted future cash-flow\nthan you are paying for. Move only when you have an advantage. its very\nbasic. You have to understand the odds and have the discipline to bet only\nwhen the odds are in your favor. 'We just keep our heads down and handle\nthe headwinds and tailwinds as best we can, and take the result after a\nperiod of years” \n \nAs we have noted, Charlie doesn't make a lot of investments. His approach\nis perhaps best summarised by Thomas Watson senior the founder of IBM I\nam no genius I am smart in sports and I stay around these sports if Chandler\nknows anything he knows his spots his carefully identified circles of\ncompetence to stay within the circles he first apply is a basic over on screen\ndesign to Limit his investment field to only simple and understandable\ncandidates as he says we have three baskets for investing yes no and to\ntough to understand to identify potential yes candidates Charlie Looks for\nan easy to understand dominant business franchise that can sustain itself\nand thrive in all market environment understandably few company survive\nthis first cut many investor favourites such as pharmaceuticals and\n\f\nTechnology for example go straight to the too tough to understand basket\nheavily promoted Deals And IPOs earn an immediate no. Those that do\nsurvive this first winnowing are subjected to the screens and filters of\nCharlie mental model approach the process is intense and darwinian but\nalso efficient Charlie detest placer mining the process of sifting through\npiles of sand for specs of gold instead he applies his big ideas from the big\ndisciplines to find the large and reorganize nuggets of gold that sometimes\nlie in plain sight on the ground \n \nThroughout his exhaustive evaluation Charlie is no slave to a database he\ntakes into account all relevant aspects both internal and external to the\ncompany and its industry even if they are difficult to identify, measure, or\nreduce to numbers. His thoroughness, however, does not cause him to\nforget his overall \"ecosystem\" theme: Sometimes the maximization or\nminimization of a single factor (notably specialization, as he likes to point\nout regarding Costco's discount warehouses) can make that single factor\ndisproportionately important. \n \nIdentifying Your Circle of Competence \n \nIn Talk Nine (page 400), Charlie tells the apocrypha story of Max Planck\nand the chauffeur who drove him to the public lectures he gave throughout\nGermany. On one occasion the chauffeuR who by this time knew the lecture\nby heart, suggested that he and Planck switch places. At the conclusion of\nthe chauffeur flawless recitation of the lecture, a physicist stood up and\nposed a very difficult question. The chauffeur, ready for the situation,"

However, if the moat is widened\nevery year' the business will do very well. When we see a moat that's\ntenuous in any way-it's just too risky. We don't know how to evaluate that.\nAnd, therefore' we leave it alone. We think that all of our businesses-or\nvirtually all of our businesses-have pretty darned good moats. And we think\nthe managers are widening them. \nCharlie?\" \nMunger: \"How could you say it better?\" \nBuffett: \"Sure. Have some peanut brittle on that one\"' \n \nCharlie treats financial reports and their underlying accounting with a\nMidwestern dose of skepticism. At best, they are merely the beginning of a\n\f\nproper calculation of intrinsic valuation, not the end. The list of additional\nfactors he examines is seemingly endless and includes such things as the\ncurrent and prospective regulatory climate; state of labor, supplier, and\ncustomer relations; potential impact of changes in technology; competitive\nstrengths and vulnerabilities; pricing power; scalability; environmental\nissues; and, notably, the presence of hidden exposures (Charlie knows that\nthere is no such thing as a riskless investment candidate; he's searching for\nthose with few risks that are easily understandable). He record all financial\nstatement figures to fit his own view of reality, including the actual free or\n\"owners\" cash being produced, inventory and other working capital assets,\nfixed assets, and such frequently overstated intangible assets as goodwill.\nHe also completes an assessment of the true impact, current and future, of\nthe cost of stock options, pension plans, and retiree medical benefits. He\napplies equal scrutiny to the liability side of the balance sheet. For example,\nunder the right circumstances, he might view an obligation such as\ninsurance float-premium income that may not be paid out in claims for\nmany years-more properly as an asset. He especially assesses a company's\nmanagement well beyond conventional number crunching-in particular, the\ndegree to which they are \"able, trustworthy, and owner-oriented.\" For\nexample, how do they deploy cash? Do they allocate it intelligently on\nbehalf of the owners, or do they overcompensate themselves, or pursue ego-\noriented growth for growth's sake? Above all, he attempts to assess and\nunderstand competitive advantage in every respect-products, markets,\ntrademarks, employees, distribution channels, societal trends, and so on-and\nthe durability of that advantage. Charlie refers to a company's competitive\nadvantage as its \"moat\": the virtual physical barrier it presents against\nincursions. Superior companies have deep moats that are continuously\n\f\nwidened to provide enduring protection. In this vein, Charlie carefully\nconsiders \"competitive destruction\" forces that, over the long term, lay\nsiege to most companies. Munger and and perfect are laser focused on this\nissue over their long business careers they have learnt sometimes painfully\nthat few business survive over multiple generations. Accordingly, they\nstrive to identify and buy only chose businesses with a good chance of\nbeating these tough odds. Finally, Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic\nvalue of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc.,\nto determine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices.\nThis letter comparison is in the fundamental purpose of the whole process\ncomparing value but you get with price but you pay on this subject he is\nfamous for his you. That a great business at a fair price is superior to affair\nbusiness at a great price \n \nWarren Buffett opening credits Charlie with convincing him of the wisdom\nof this approach Charlie understood this early I was a slow learner child Li\ninside help Buffett move from pure Benjamin Graham style investing to\nfocusing on great business such as the Washington Post Coca-Cola gellert\nand others. \nThough extremely thorough Charlie is able to ignore the insignificant detail\nand the distractions to which other sometimes fall victim. Investment\nvariables just like all other variables go through their own process of\nelimination by the time he's finished with his analysis he has reduced the\ncandidate to its most salient elements and achieve the remarkable degree of\nconfidence about whether or not to act. The evaluation, finally, becomes not\nso much mathematical as philosophical. Ultimately \"a feel\" emerges, a\n\f\nfunction of both the analysis itself and Charlie's lifetime of accumulated\nexperience and skill in recognizing patterns. \n \nAt this point, only an exceptionally superior investment candidate will still\nbe in the running. But Charlie does not immediately rush out and buy it.\nKnowing that a necessary companion to proper valuation is proper timing,\nhe applies yeti a finer screen, a \"prior to pulling the trigger\" checklist,\nwhich is especially useful in evaluating what he refers to as \"close calls.\"\nThe checklist includes such items as: What are current price, volume, and\ntrading considerations? What disclosure timing or other sensitivities exist?\nDo contingent exit strategies exist? Are better uses of capital currently or\npotentially available? Is sufficient liquid capital currently on hand or must it\nbe borrowed? What is the opportunity cost of that capital? And so on.\nCharlie's exhaustive screening process requires considerable self-discipline\nand results in long periods of apparent \"inactivity.\" But as Charlie says,\n\"Hard work is an essential element in tracking down and perfecting a\nstrategy or in executing it.\" For Charlie and Warren, the hard work is\ncontinuous, whether it results in current investing activity or not-and\nusually it does not. This habit of committing far more time to learning and\nthinking than to doing is no accident. It is the blend of discipline and\npatience exhibited by true masters of a craft: an uncompromising\ncommitment to \"properly playing the hand.\" Like world-class bridge player\nRichard Zeckhauser, Charlie scores himself not so much on whether he won\nthe hand, but rather on how well he played it. While poor outcomes are\nexcusable in the,Munger Buffett world-given the fact that some outcomes\n\f\nare outside of their control-sloppy preparation and decision making are\nnever excusable because they ARE controllable. \n \nProperly Playing the Hand \n \n\"The right way to think is the way Zeckhauser plays bridge. its just that\nsimple.\" \n \n\"Most players gain pleasure from feeling accepted or belonging to the\ngroup. The good \nplayer however, gains pleasure from his ability to cope with the realities of\nthe game”  \n \n\"In investing, just as in baseball, to put runs on the scoreboard, one must\nwatch the playing \nfield, not the scoreboard” \n \nOn those relatively few occasions when all the circumstances are just right\nand Charlie does invest, he will likely make a large, decisive bet. He does\nnot pick around the edges, take \"initial positions,\" or make \"small,\nspeculative investments.\" \n \nSuch behavior implies uncertainty, and Charlie's moves, few as they are, are\nanything but uncertain. As he says, he practices \"extreme patience\ncombined with extreme decisiveness.\" Charlie's self-confidence is based not\non who, or how many, agree or disagree with him, but on his ability to\n\f\nobjectively view and measure himself. This self-mastery affords him rare\nobjectivity in gauging his actual knowledge, experience, and correctness of\nthought. Again, we see the important role played by the right kinds of\ntemperamental qualities: self-discipline, patience, calm, independence.\nCharlie's level of investment performance is arguably impossible without\nthem. \n \nOkay, it's a good company. But is the price low enough? Is the management\nmade up of people Munger and Buffett Are comfortable with? If it is cheap\nenough to buy, is it cheap for the wrong reason or the right reason? What's\nthe flip side? What can go wrong that I haven't seen? \n \nWhat makes a great business model for Charlie? His recommended reading\nmaterials (see Appendix) provide some guidance. Guns, Germs, and Steel,\nThe selfish Gene, Ice Age, and Darwin's Blind Spot all have a certain\ntheme: a focus on the aforementioned issue of \"competitive destruction\"\nand an examination of why some entities are nevertheless able to adapt,\nsurvive, and even dominate over time. When this theme is extrapolated into\ninvestment selection, the preferred Munger business emerges: Some thrive\nby outcompeting (la Selfish Gene) and others by out cooperating (Darwin's\nBlind Spot). Once again, we see Charlie's rich fluency across a broad range\nof disciplines at work: How many investors ever consider, as Charlie\nroutinely does, such a broad and sophisticated spectrum of factors? To name\nbut a few, he routinely considers factors such as conversion, i.e., how the\nlaws of thermodynamics intersect with laws of economics (for instance how\npaper and petroleum become a newspaper delivered to a front door),\n\f\npsychological tendencies and incentives (notably the extreme behavioral\npressures they create, both good and bad), and fundamental sustainability\nover time (the constant and often deadly interplay between positive factors\nsuch as \"moats\" and the ravages of competitive destruction). Charlie is\npossibly without peer when it comes to the checklist of atypical investment\nfactors he considers and his deep fluency in the diverse disciplines from\nwhich they are drawn. \n \n'All intelligent investing is a value investing acquiring more than you are\npaying for You must value the business in order to value the stock.\" \n \nPrice is What You Pay, Value is What You Get \n \nOn several occasions, incurring the skepticism that must often be borne by\n\"value-style\" investors, the United States has made astute territorial\nacquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson's administration completed the\nLouisiana Purchase from Napoleon France for the sum of $15 million,\nwhich worked out to roughly 2.9 cents an acre. In 1867, in what at the time\nwas known as \"Seward's Folly,\" the US acquired the Territory of Alaska\nfrom Russia for the sum of $7.2 million in gold, or roughly 2.5 cents an\nacre. By way of comparison, the Alaska purchase price, in 2006 dollars, is\nthe equivalent of $1.67 billion, certainly no folly in terms of the value of\noil, minerals, and strategic advantages obtained. \n \n\"People always want a formula-but it doesn't work that way. You have to\nestimate total cash generated from now to eternity, and discount it back to\n\f\ntoday. Yardsticks such as P/Es are not enough by themselves.\" -Buffett \n \n\"You need a different checklist and different mental models for different\ncompanies. I can never make it easy by saying, 'Here are three things.' You\nhave to derive it yourself to ingrain it in your head for the rest of your life.\"-\nMunger \n \nAn Investing Principles Checklist \n \n\"No wisepilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use his\nchecklist.\" \n \nWe have now examined Charlie's approach to thinking in general and to\ninvesting in particular. In keeping with our intent to observe \"how he seems\nto do it,\" we will recap his approach by using the \"checklist\" methodology\nhe advocates. (For Charlie's own words of wisdom on the value and\nimportance of checklists, see talk Five and page 320.) Note, however, that\nthe following principles are most certainly not employed by Charlie in a\none-by-one or one-time fashion as the checklist format might seem to\nimply. Nor can they necessarily be prioritized in terms of any apparent or\nrelative importance. Rather, each must be considered as part of the complex\nwhole or gestalt of the investment analysis process, in much the same way\nthat an individual tile is integral to the larger mosaic in which it appears \n \n1. Risk-All investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk,\nespecially reputational\n\f\nIncorporate an appropriate margin of safety  \nAvoid dealing with people of questionable character  \nInsist upon proper compensation for risk assumed  \nAlways beware of inflation and interest rate exposures. \nAvoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss \n \n2.

Preparation-'the only way to win is to work, work, work, work, and\nhope to have a few insights\" \nDevelop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious\nreading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a\nlittle wiser every day \nMore important than the will to win is the will to\nprepare .  \nDevelop fluency in mental models from the major\nacademic disciplines .\n\f\nIf you want to get smart, the question you have to keep\nasking is \"why, why, why?\" \n \n4.

So the game is to keep learning,\nand I don't think people are going to keep learning who don't like the\nlearning process.\" \n \n\"Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of\ngetting it, is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of thing” \n \nSince human beings began investing, they have been searching for a magic\nformula or easy recipe for instant wealth. As you can see, Charlie's superior\nperformance doesn't come from a magic formula or some business-school-\ninspired system. It comes from what he calls his \"constant search for better\nmethods of thought,\" a willingness to \"prepay\" through rigorous\npreparation, and from the extraordinary outcomes of his multidisciplinary\nresearch model. In the end/, it comes down to Charlie's most basic guiding\nprinciples, his fundamental philosophy of life: Preparation. Discipline.\nPatience. Decisiveness. Each attribute is in turn lost without the other, but\ntogether they form the dynamic critical mass for a cascading of positive\neffects for which Munger is famous (the \"lollapalooza\" ). \n \nFinally, a word or two on why this overview of Charlie's investment\nphilosophy has focused so much on the subject of \"what to buy\" and so\nlittle on \"when to sell.\" 'the answer, in Charlie's own words, serves as a\nwonderful summation of the \"munger School\" of highly-concentrated,\nfocused investing described here:\n\f\n\" we are partial to putting out large amounts of money where we won't have\nto make another decision if you buy something because it's undervalued\nthen you have to think about selling it when it approaches your calculation\nof intrinsic value that's hard but if you can buy a few great companies then\nyou can sit on your ass that's a good thing.\" \nLike his hero, Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Munger painstakingly developed\nand perfected unique approaches to personal and business endeavors.\nThrough these methods, and the development and maintenance of sound,\nlifelong habits, he has achieved extraordinary success. \n \n'And so these complex, aging prodigies carefully tend their compound\ninterest machine, a joint creation of two exceptional personalities. Others\nmay try to duplicate Berkshire Hathaway, but they won't be able to\nduplicate these two exceptional minds.\" \n-Robert Lenzner and David S. Fondiller \n \nHonesty Is the Best Policy \n \nConsistent with his Midwestern roots, honesty and integrity and Charles\nMunger have always been synonymous. As Charlie once said, \"Doing the\nright thing can pay big dividends both personally and professionally.\" As a\ntestimonial to just how deeply honesty and integrity are ingrained in\nCharlie, his daughter Wendy recalls the Watergate era and the sympathy she\nhad for the daughters of Richard Nixon, as their father's ethical lapses\nbecame known. \"l knew without a doubt that my dad would never put us in\na similar situation. I can't tell you how wonderful that made me feel.\"\n\f\nWe asked legendary fixed-income expert Bill Gross of PIMCO to comment\non Charlie and honesty. Here is what he had to say: \"When the East and the\nWest coast's fall into the sea, either through storm, earthquake, or a\ndeterioration of values, there will still be Munger's Omaha. Charlie's ethical\nstandards should be beamed by satellite to all global financial centers to\nprevent future Enron's and WorldCom's. \n\"What fine examples and teachers Charlie and Warren are, especially for\nyoung people. As Albert Schweitzer said, 'Example is not the main thing in\nteaching-it is the only thing.' Charlie and Warren, in a lifetime business\n'race,' have not only finished up front, but have never cut any corners along\nthe way. \n\"One could not find more exemplary 'Honest Abe's' in the financial world\nthan Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Their annual reports are legend,\nand they contain not only words of bona fide investment wisdom, but self-\nrecrimination when deemed necessary.\" \n \n*I think track records are very important, If you start early trying to have a\nperfect one in some simple thing like honesty, you're well on your way to\nsuccess in this world.\" \n-Charles T Munger \n \nRick Guerin, longtime friend and business associate adds: \"On two\noccasions. I saw Charlie pay more than he needed to in business\ntransactions. First, with two little old ladies who held notes in a business we\nwere buying, which we could have easily redeemed at far less than face\n\f\nvalue-Charlie nevertheless paid them face value. Second, to raise some cash\nI needed for another investment, I offered to sell him my half of a venture\nwe were in together, and he said to set a fair price-I said $130,000; he said,\nno, $230,000 was correct, and he paid me that. This also presented Charlie\nwith the opportunity to use one of his favorite lines: 'I'm right, and you're\nsmart, and sooner or later you'll see I'm right.' Of course, he was right on\nboth scores-he had set a more accurate price, and I did eventually come to\nsee it that way. \n \n\"'taking advantage of a cheap stock price on the stock exchange is one\nthing, but taking advantage of partners or old ladies is something else-\nsomething Charlie just doesn't do.\" \n \nCharlie on Honesty: 2004 Wesco Meeting \n \n\"Louis Vincenti, who used to sit in the chair I occupy today, used to say, 'If\nyou tell the truth, you don't have to remember your lies.' So we try and keep\nit simple by telling it like it is at all times. Having so many longtime loyal\nshareholders means that we have never given a damn whether any quarter's\nearnings were up or down-at least we don't care in terms of their effect on\nshareholders. 'We prefer profits to losses, obviously. But we're not willing\nto manipulate in any way just to make some quarter look a little better. And\nthat's a very difFerent ethos from the standard. \n'And in terms of intellectual content, I think this place tries harder to be\nrational than most places. And I think it tries harder than most places to be\nethical-meaning to tell the truth and to not be abusive. Now with 175,000\n\f\nemployees, or something like that, at Berkshire, I'll bet as I sit here at least\none of them is doing something that I would very much regret. However,\ndespite the presence of some human failing, we've had an amazingly low\namount of litigation or scandal or anything of that sort over a vast number\nof decades. And people notice that. \n \n\"We think there should be a huge area between what you're willing to do\nand what you can do without significant risk of suffering criminal penalty\nfor causing losses. We believe you shouldn't go anywhere near that line.\nYou ought to have an internal compass. So there should be all kinds of\nthings you won't do even though they're perfectly legal. That the way we try\nto operate. \n\"l don't think we deserve a lot of credit for that because we early understood\nthat we'd make more money that way. And since we understood it so well,\nI'm not sure that we're entitled to credit for such morality as we have. \n\"Of course, it is hard to know your own motivations. But I d like to believe\nthat we'd all behave well even if it didn't work so well financially. And\nevery once in a while, we get an opportunity to behave that way. But more\noften we're made extra money out of morality. Ben Franklin was right for\nus. He didn't say honesty was the best morals, he said it was the best\npolicy.\" \n \nOur First I have nothing to Add… \n \nOn occasion, Charlie will pose a challenging question to his audience, or\nreceive one, and leave it unanswered. By so doing, he says, he encourages\n\f\nhis listeners to \"reach\" for the answers themselves and, as a result, better\nlearn and retain the information they discover. Charlie says his father\nroutinely used this same technique with him, with results that still benefit\nhim today. In keeping with the promise of this book to present the wit and\nwisdom of Charlie Munger, we consider it a responsibility and duty to once\nand for all provide answers to some of the riddles and questions Charlie has\nlong left us \"reaching\" for, but never quite grasping. \n \nWe begin with this question from the talk Charlie gave at the Harvard\nFaculty Club, October 6, 1994,  \n \n\"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\": \nQuestion: \"You cite the Warren Buffett rule for outcry auctions: 'Don't go.'\nThen you say, 'We don't go to the closed bid auctions either, but for a\ndifferent reason, one which Zeckhauser would understand.\"' \n \nAnswer: \"Zeckhauser-hs's the Harvard professor who is also a great bridge\nplayer. The problem, a different one, with closed bid auctions is that they\nare frequently won by people making a technical mistake, as in the case of\nShell Paying double for Belridge Oil. You can't pay double the losing bid at\nan open outcry auction. You don't have that problem, you have different\nones. But closed bid auctions invite a possibility for big mispricing errors.\" \n \nLook for more \"I Have Nothing to Add\" moments sprinkled throughout the\nbook."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 3 \n \nMungerisms : Charlie Unscripted\nHighlights from Recent Berkshire\nHathaway and Wesco Financial Annual\nMeetings By Whitney Tilson \n \n\"The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by\nquotations.\" \n-Isaac Disraeli \n \nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger are undoubtedly the greatest investment\nduo ever, so any investor who fails to learn as much as possible about these\ntwo men and how they achieved their success is, to use one of Charlie's\nfavorite words. \"Bonkers.\" \n \nBut the real joy of studying Warren and Charlie is not that one can learn a\ngreat deal about how to compound money at a high rate for an extended\nperiod-though this is certainly a nice side benefit! Rather, by absorbing their\nteachings, one will gain a far deeper understanding of the human condition,\nthe state of the world, how to think rationally, and, most importantly, how to\nbetter lead a life of integrity, happiness, and kindness (here's a hint: these\ncharacteristics are intertwined).\n\f\nLearning from Warren isn't hard there are many books about him; he\nregularly gives speeches, writes articles, and makes public appearances; and\nhe's published lengthy annual letters for decades (you can read the last\nthirty of them for free at www.berkshirehathaway.com; if you haven't done\nso already, what \nare you waiting for?!). But Charlie is more private: There are only two\nbooks about him, and he is a far less prolific writer and speaker. \n \nFor this reason, many people fail to recognize that Charlie is a genius in his\nown right, and that \nhe has had a profound effect on Warren's investment philosophy, which\nWarren freely acknowledges. The dynamic between them is pretty funny to\nwatch. On stage at the Berkshire annual meeting, Warren generally takes\nthe first stab at answering a question, but then usually turns and says,\n\"Charlie?\" Immobile and expressionless (they could easily substitute a\nmannequin for him, and no one would notice most of the time), Charlie\ntypically replies, \"I have nothing to add.\" Those five words have become a\ntrademark of Charlie's [hat often delights both Warren and the audience. (In\nfact, at the special meeting for the Gen Re acquisition in September 1998,\nWarren actually showed up with a cardboard cutout of Charlie and a\nrecording of Charlie saying, \"I have nothing to add.\" According to one of\nmy friends in attendance, \"Warren would get that impish look each of the\nhalf dozen or so times he used it.\") Those words also reflect both Charlie's\nabrupt, curmudgeonly nature-at least that's his public persona-and the \"two-\nminds-as-one\" relationship of brilliant partners joined in their thoughts.\n\f\nBut when Charlie does have something to add, it is often piercing and\ninsightful, and he doesn't pull any punches. To use his own words, Charlie\nis a \"cranky, old fashioned\" man and has never worried about being\npolitically correct-he just calls it the way he sees it. \nSince Warren does most of the talking at the Berkshire meeting, I always\nlike to attend the Wesco annual meeting a few days later in Pasadena to hear\nCharlie's in-depth thinking (he is the chairman of Wesco Financial, a\nholding company with a structure similar to Berkshire's, which owns 80. 1\npercent of Wesco). One needn't even be a shareholder to attend; Charlie-as\nhe and Warren do at the Berkshire meeting-welcomes all pilgrims to the\nchurch of Graham, Dodd, Buffett, and Munger. I've never regretted making\nthe cross-country trip so soon after returning from Omaha, as Charlie's\nmind remains in peak form. During the 2003 meeting, as Charlie made one\ninsightful observation after another, one of my friends leaned over and\nwhispered to me, \"This is one unbelievable eighty-year-old!\" Indeed! \n \nAs a teacher and a thinker, Charlie is Warren's equal, and I've learned an\nenormous amount from him, which is why I was so delighted to hear that\nPeter Kaufman was pulling this book together-and why I immediately\nagreed to contribute! \n \nThis chapter is intended to complement Charlie's formal writings and\nspeeches that appear elsewhere in this book. Drawn from my notes from the\nBerkshire and Wesco annual meetings over the past five years, this is a\ncollection of the most insightful, provocative, spontaneous, funny things\n\f\nCharlie said at these meetings. Since almost all of his remarks are in\nresponse to questions from shareholders, he comments extensively on\nBerkshire Hathaway and many business- and investing related topics. To\nmake Charlie's teachings more accessible, I've organized them by topic and\nalso done some light editing, but the goal is to let him speak for himself.\nEnjoy! \n \n\"I have been associated for many years with a man legendary for good\njudgment, and it never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be\ngrasped if one merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and\neasily learned principles.\" \n-Munger \n \n101 \n \nKeys to Our Success \n \n1) It is occasionally possible for a tortoise, content! to assimilate proven\ninsights of his best predecessors, to outrun hares that seek originality or\ndon't wish to be left out of some crowd folly that ignores the best work of\nthe past. This happens as the tortoise stumbles on some particularly\neffective way to apply the best previous work, or simply avoids standard\ncalamities. We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious\nthan from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long-term\nadvantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid,\ninstead of trying to be very intelligent.\n\f\n2) We don't claim to have perfect morals, but at least we have a huge area of\nthings that, while legal, are beneath us. We won't do them. Currently, there's\na culture in America that says that anything that won't send you to prison is\nokay. We believe there should be a huge area between everything you\nshould do and everything you can do without getting into legal trouble. I\ndon't think you should come anywhere near that line. We don't deserve\nmuch credit for this. It helps us make more money. I'd like to believe that\nwe'd behave well even if it didn't work. But more often, we've made extra\nmoney from doing the right thing. \n \nRemember Louis Vincent's rule: Tell the truth, and you won't have to\nremember your lies. It's such a simple concept. \n \nComments on Berkshire Hathaway \n \nBerkshire Is a Hell of a Business \nWe're like the hedgehog that only knows one big thing: If you can generate\nfloat [cash from insurance premiums that Berkshire can invest before\nclaims must be paid] at three percent and invest it in businesses that\ngenerate thirteen percent, that's a pretty good business. The businesses that\nBerkshire has acquired will return thirteen percent pretax on what we paid\nfor them, maybe more. With a cost of capital of three percent generated via\nother people's money in the form of float-that's a hell of a business. That's\nthe reason Berkshire shareholders needn't totally despair. Berkshire is not as\n\f\ngood as it was in terms of percentage compounding [going forward], but it's\nstill a hell of a business. \n \nI hate to be an optimist, but we have added a lot of wonderful businesses to\nBerkshire over the past few yeArs, Berkshire's Past Returns Berkshire's past\nrecord has been almost ridiculous. If Berkshire had used even half the\nleverage of, say, Rupert Murdoch, it would be five times its current size.\nBerkshire's Future Outlook One of the smartest things a person can do is\ndampen investment expectations, especially with Berkshire. That would be\nmature and responsible. I like our model, and we should do nicely. \n \nThe future will be harder for Berkshire Hathaway for two reasons: \n1) We're so big. It limits our investment options to more competitive areas\nthat are examined by very smart people like Alice Schroeder [the insurance\nanalyst from Paine Webber and then Morgan Stanley, who was sitting in the\naudience]. \n \n2) The current climate offers prospects in common stocks over the next\nfifteen to twenty years that are way less than we've experienced over the\npast fifteen to twenty years. Read Warren's Fortune article-I totally agree\nwith it. [\"Mr. Buffett on the Stock market,\" 11/22/99 \n \nBerkshire Hathaway's value will be higher in twenty years, but it is certain\nthat the annual rate of percentage growth will be much lower. But this is not\na tragedy. We're content. Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco will accumulate\ncash every year, and we have a structure that gives us enormous flexibility."

    "raw_text": "While we're too big to buy the stock of a small company, we have the\nadvantage of having entire companies offered to us. Something has always\nturned up for us. I'm not discouraged, but I don't think your money here is\ngoing to do anything like what you're used to. It's a finite and very\ncompetitive world. All large aggregations of capital eventually find it hell\non earth to grow and thus find a lower rate of return. \nPersonally, I think Berkshire will be a lot bigger and stronger than it is.\nWhether the stock will be a good investment from today's price is another\nquestion. The one thing we've always guaranteed is that the future will be a\nlot worse than the past. \n \nThe future returns of Berkshire and Wesco won't be as good in the future as\nthey have been in the past. [This is true of all large, successful companies.]\nThe only difference is that we'll tell you. \n \nBerkshire Hathaway's Culture \n \nOur culture is very old-fashioned, like Ben Franklin's or Andrew\nCarnegie's. Can you imagine Carnegie hiring consultants?! It's amazing\nhow well this approach still works. A lot of the businesses we buy are kind\nof cranky and old-fashioned like us. \nFor many of our shareholders, our stock is all they own, and we're acutely\naware of that. Our culture [of conservatism] runs pretty deep. \nThis is an amazingly sound place. We are more disaster-resistant than most\nother places. We haven't pushed it as hard as other people would have\npushed it.\n\f\nI'm happy having ninety percent of my net worth in Berkshire stock. We're\ngoing to try to compound it at a reasonable rate with or-rt taking\nunreasonable risk of using leverage. If we can't do this, then that's just too\ndamn bad. \n \nBerkshire's and Wesco's Stock Prices \n \nWe like the stocks of both Berkshire and Wesco to trade within hailing\ndistance of what we think of as intrinsic value. When it runs up, we try to\ntalk it down. That's not at all common in Corporate America, but that's the\nway we act. \n \nI don't want to go back to Go. I've been to Go. A lot of our shareholders\ntake a majority of their net worth in Berkshire, and they don't want to go\nback to go either. \n \nToday, it seems to be regarded as the duty of CEOs to make the stock go up\nThis leads to all sorts of foolish behavior. we want to tell it like it is. \n \nBerkshire Shareholders \n \nWe like our current shareholders and don't want to entice anyone to become\none. I think our reporting, considering the complexity of the enterprise, is\nbetter than that of any enterprise I know at giving shareholders the\ninformation they need. We do it conscientiously.\n\f\nBerkshire's Acquisition Strategy \n \nTwo-thirds of acquisitions don't work. Ours work because we don't try to do\nacquisitions-we wait for no-brainers. \n \nCompetition for Acquisitions \n \nWe've had private equity competitors for a long time, but one way or\nanother, we've managed to buy quite a few things. The general assumption\nis that it must be easy to sit behind a desk and people will bring in one good\nopportunity after another-this was the attitude in venture capital until a few\nyears ago. This was not the case at all for us-we scrounge around for\ncompanies to buy. For twenty years, we didn't buy more than one or two per\nyear. It's fair to say that we were rooting around. There were no\ncommissioned salesmen. Anytime you sit there waiting for a deal to come\nby, you're in a very dangerous seat. \n \nManagers of Acquired Companies \n \nWe've bought business after business because we admire the founders and\nwhat they've done with their lives. In almost all cases, they've stayed on,\nand our expectations have not been disappointed. What matters most\npassion or competence that was inborn? Berkshire is full of people who\nhave a peculiar passion for their own business. I would argue passion is\nmore important than brain power. I don't think our managers who come to\nthis meeting are picking up new tricks they know all the tricks related to"

And\nincluded in that reality recognition is the recognition that previous\nconclusions were incorrect \n \nIt would help current shareholders to hear our CEOs [of the Berkshire\noperating subsidiaries], but we promised them they could spend one\nhundred percent of their time on their businesses. We place no impediments\non them running their businesses. Many have expressed to me how happy\nthey are that they don't?t have to spend twenty-five percent of their time on\nactivities they don't like. \n \nThere Are certain virtues that are common in all of Berkshire's subsidiaries.\n'We don't creAte them-we select companies that have them already, We just\ndon't screw) it up.

Yes, it exists, but there are so\nmany false promises. Berkshire is full of synergies-we don't avoid\nsynergies, just claims of synergies. \n \nMaking the Right Personnel Decisions \n \nIt's amazing how few times over the decades we've had to remove a person-\nfar less than other companies. It's not that we're soft or foolish, it's that\nwe're wiser and luckier. Most people would look back and say their worst\nmistake was not firing someone soon enough. [We don't say that.] Our\nrecord is fabulous. We're old fashioned. For example, in the case of CORT\nBusiness Services [a furniture rental business that Wesco acquired], Warren\nsaid to me, \"You're going to love Paul Arnold [CORT's CEO].\" And he was\nright. Paul's been running the business since he was in law school and loves\nit. \n \nBerkshire's Insurance Operations \n \nReinsurance is not as much of a commodity business as it might appear.\nThere's such a huge time lag between when the policy is written and when it\nis paid that the customer has to evaluate the insurer's future willingness and\nability to pay. We have a reputational advantage, though it's not as big as it\nshould be. \nI do think we get some advantage in reinsurance because people trust our\nwillingness and ability to pay, so it's not a commodity.

This is not a small advantage. \n \nNobody Else does it but to me not worrying about trying to please Wall\nStreet is obviously the only way to go a lot about Berkshire is like this\nbeing controlling owners is key, it would be hard for a committee to make\nthese kinds of decisions.\n\f\nBerkshire Hathaway Repurchasing shares \n \nIn the past when Berkshire had gotten cheap we have found other even\ncheapest stocks to buy I would always preferred this it's more fun to have\nthe companies so lacking in repute that we can make money for some\nshareholders by buying out others \n \nSplitting backside stock to create more liquidity \n \nI think the notion that liquidity of tradeable common stock is a great\ncontributor to capitalism is mostly twaddle the liquidity gives as these crazy\nbooms so it has as many problems as virtues \n \n[Buffett: Berkshire trades $50 million of stock per day, so very few people\nwill have a problem selling it. \nBut we're trying to create more people who have the problem of owning\nstock worth so much that liquidity is an issue. \n \nWhy Don't More Companies and Investors Copy Berkshire Hathaway? \nIt's a good question. Our approach has worked for us. Look at the fun we,\nour managers, and our shareholders are having. More people should copy\nus. It's not difficult, but it looks difficult because it's unconventional-it isn't\nthe way things are normally done. We have low overhead, don't have\nquarterly goals and budgets or a standard personnel system, and our\n\f\ninvesting is much more concentrated than the average. It's simple and\ncommon sense. \nI was recently speaking with Jack McDonald, who teaches a course on\ninvesting rooted in our principles at Stanford Business School. He said it's\nlonely-like he's the Maytag repairman ( because of great reliability of\nmaytang products the appliance repair man becomes the loneliest man in\ntown). \n \nComments on Buffett \n \nIt's hard to believe that he's getting better with each passing year. It won't go\non forever, but Warren is actually improving. It's remarkable: Most seventy-\ntwo-year-old men are not improving, but Warren is. \n \nCharlie's Influence on Warren \n \nI think those authors give me more credit than I deserve. It is true that\nWarren had a touch of brain block \nfrom working under Ben Graham and making a ton of money-it's hard to\nswitch from something that's worked so well. But if Charlie Munger had\nnever lived, the Buffett record would still be pretty much what it is. \n \nI think there's some mythology in this idea that I've been the great\nenlightener of Warren. He hasn't needed much enlightenment. But we know\nmore now than five years ago."

    "raw_text": "What Happens When Buffett's Gone? \n \nThe key is having good businesses. There's a lot of momentum here.\n[However,] I don't think our successors will be as good as Warren at capital\nallocation. \nBerkshire is drowning in money-we have great businesses pounding out\nmoney. If the stock went down, Berkshire could buy it back. There's no\nreason to think it will go to hell in a bucket, and I think there's reason to\nbelieve it could go on quite well. I'd be horrified if it isn't bigger and better\nover time, even after Warren dies. \n \nWhen Warren is gone, the acquisition side of Berkshire will not do as well,\nbut the rest will do well. And the acquisition side will do just fine. In any\ncase, we've guaranteed you that the historical rate of growth will go down,\nand we wouldn't want to make a liar out of me. I think the top guy won't be\nas smart as Warren. But it's silly to complain: \"What kind of world is this\nthat gives me Warren Buffett for forty years, and then some bastard comes\nalong who's worse?\" \nIf anyone would have a reason to worry, it would be me, but having known\nthe Buffett family for decades, I say to you: \"Don't worry about it. You\nshould be so Lucky.\" \n \nWhat If Charlie Dies? \nAs you can tell, we're planning on immortality here. What do you need-\nsitting on a pile of money and Warren Buffett sitting at the parent\ncorporation?\n\f\nCharlie as the Abominable No-Man \n \nBuffet: You just have to learn how to calibrate his answers. If you ask\nCharlie something and he says \"no,\" then we put all of our money in it. [f he\nsays \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,\" then we make a more\nmoderate investment. If you calibrate his answers, you'll get a lot of\nwisdom. \n \nCharlie, the Abominable No-Man \nExchange at a recent Berkshire shareholders' meeting: 'Warren: \"Charlie, do\nyou have any additional comment?\" \nCharlie: \"No. I think you said ho' perfectly.\" \n \nChuck Rickershauser. former Munger Tolles partner and friend since 1964 \n \n“Warren told me a story once that, back in the early days of their\nrelationship, when they had no financial connection and each had an\ninvestment partnership, Warren would frequently call up Charlie and say,\n'I'm thinking of doing something' and describe it, and Charlie would say,\n'my God, are you kidding? There's this risk and that risk.' They'd go right\nthrough all these risks that Charlie saw and Warren would usually say, 'I\nthink you're right.' But once in a while, he would say, 'Charlie, I've heard\neverything you said, but I think I'm going to go ahead.' Warren said that it\nwasn't until that instant that he'd learn what Charlie really thought because\noccasionally Charlie would respond, 'Warren, if you do it, could I have a\n\f\npercentage of it?' People often think of Charlie as identifying risks and\nsaying, 'No,' but it was his ability to identify the times to ask for a\npercentage that was most valuable.\" \n \nOtis Booth. friend and business associate since 1956 \nCharlie realizes that it is difficult to find something is really good. So, if\nyou say 'No' ninety percent of the time, you're not missing much in the\nWorld.\" \n \nInvestment Advice \n \nThe Importance of Temperament, Patience, and Curiosity \n \n[One of the key elements to successful investing is having the right]\ntemperament-most people are too fretful; they worry too much. Success\nmeans being very patient, but aggressive when it's time. And the more hard\nlessons you can learn vicariously rather than through your own hard\nexperience, the better. \nI think there's something to be said for developing the disposition to own\nstocks without fretting. [But] temperament alone won't do it. You need a lot\nof curiosity for a long, long time. \nYou need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That\ncast of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to\nfocus on reality. If you don't have that case of mind, you're destined for\nfailure even if you have a high I.Q."

    "raw_text": "Focus Investing \n \nOur investment style has been given a name-focus investing-which implies\nten holdings, not one hundred or four hundred. The idea that it is hard to\nfind good investments, so concentrate in a few, seems to me to be an\nobviously good idea. But ninety-eight percent of the investment world\ndoesn't think this way. It's been good for us-and you-that we've done this.\nWhat's funny is that most big investment organizations don't think like this.\nThey hire lots of people, evaluate Merck vs. Pfizer and every stock in the\nS&P 500, and think they can beat the market. You can't do it. \n \nOur game is to recognize a business idea when it comes along when one\ndoesn't come along very often, Opportunity comes to the prepared mind.. \n \nWe have this investment discipline of waiting for a fat pitch. If I was\noffered the chance to go into a business where people would measure me\nagainst benchmarks, force me to be fully invested, crawl around looking\nover my shoulder, etc., I would hate it. I would regard it as putting me into\nshackles. Very few people have adopted our approach. Focus investing is\ngrowing somewhat, but what's really growing is the unlimited use of\nconsultants to advise on asset allocation, to analyze other consultants, and\nso forth. Maybe two percent of people will come into our corner of the tent,\nand the rest of the ninety-eight percent will believe what they've been told\n[e.g., that markets are totally efficient. \n \nMisteaching Investing\n\f\nBeta and modern portfolio theory and the like none of it makes any sense to\nme. We're trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages\nat a low, or even a fair, price. How can professors spread this [nonsense that\na stock's volatility is a measure of risk]? I've been waiting for this craziness\nto end for decades. It's been dented, but it's still out there. Warren once said\nto me, \"I'm probably misjudging academia generally [in thinking so poorly\nof it] because the people that interact with me have bonkers theories.\" \n \nDiversification \n \nThe idea of excessive diversification is Madness we don't believe that\nwidespread diversification will yield a good result we believe almost all\ngood investments will involve relatively low diversification if you to cover\ntop 15 decisions out we would have a pretty average record it wasn't hyper\nactivity but help of a lot of patience used truck to your principles and when\nopportunities come along you pounced on them with vigor. \n \nSit-on-Your-Ass Investing \n \nIf you buy something because it's undervalued then you have to think about\nselling it when it approaches your calculation of its intrinsic value that's\nhard but if you buy a few great companies then you can sit on your ass\nthat's a good thing we are partial to putting out large amounts of money\nwhen we don't have to make another decision."

    "raw_text": "What is the better business \n \nThere are two kinds of businesses the first and 12% and you can take the\nprofits out at the end of the year 2nd and 12% but on the excess cash must\nbe reinvested there's never any cash it reminds me of the guy who sells\nconstruction equipment he looks at his used machines taken in as customers\nbought new ones and says there's all of my profit rusting in my yard we hate\nthat kind of business \n \nSee's Candy: case study of a better business \n \nIf See's Candy, when we were buying it had asked for hundred thousand\ndollars more Buffett chimed in, 10000 dollars more Warren and I would\nhave walked and that's how dumb we were. \n \nIra Marshall said you guys are crazy-there are some things you should pay\nup for, like quality businesses and people. You are underestimating quality.\nWe listened to the criticism and changed our mind. This is a good lesson for\nanyone: the ability to take criticism constructively and learn from it. If you\ntake the indirect lessons we learned from See's, you could say Berkshire\nwas built on constructive criticism \n \nMistakes \n \nThe most extreme mistakes in Berkshire's history have been mistakes of\nomission. We saw it, but didn't act on it. They're huge mistake-we've lost\n\f\nbillions. And we keep doing it. We're getting better at it. We never get over\nit. \n \nThere Are two types of mistakes:  \n1) doing nothing that Warren calls \"sucking my thumb\" and  \n2) buying with an eyedropper things we should be buying a lot of. \n \nAfter nearly making a terrible mistake not buying See's, we've made similar\nmistakes many times. We are apparently slow learners. These opportunity\ncosts don't show up on financial statements but have cost us many billions.\nSince mistakes of omission [aren't visible], most people don't pay attention\nto them. We rub our noses in mistakes of omission-as we just did. [They\nhad just discussed failing to buy Walmart stock because it moved up a bit, a\n$10 billion mistake. \n \nBuying into Stock Declines \n \nOver many decades, our usual practice is that if [the stock of something we\nlike goes down, we buy more and more. Sometimes something happens,\nyou realize you're wrong, and you get out. But if you develop correct\nconfidence in your judgment, buy more and take advantage of stock prices. \n \nAttractive investment opportunities tend to be ephemeral. Really good\ninvestment opportunities aren't going to come along too often and won't last\ntoo long, so you've got to be ready to act. Have a prepared mind.\n\f\nOpportunities for Small Investors \n \nIf you have only a little capital and are young today, there are fewer\nopportunities than when I was young. Back then, we had just come out of a\ndepression. \n \nCapitalism was a bad word. \n \nThere had been abuses in the 1920s. A joke going Around then u)as the\nGuy who said, \"I bought stock for my old age and it worked-in six months,\nI feel like an old man!\" \n \nIt's tougher for you, but that doesn't mean you won't do well-it just may take\nmore time. But what the heck. You may live longer. I'd work with very\nsmall stocks, searching for unusual mispriced opportunities, but it's such a\nsmall world. \n \nShort Selling \nBeing short and seeing a promoter take the stock up is very irritating. It's\nnot worth it to have that much irritation in your life. \n \nMoats and Sustainable Competitive Advantage \nOld moats Are getting filed in and new moats Are harder to predict, so it's\ngetting harden \n \nLearning Process\n\f\nI don't know anyone who learned to be a great investor] with great rapidity.\nWarren has gotten to be one hell of a lot better investor over the period I've\nknown him, as have I. So the game is to keep learning. You gotta like the\nlearning process. \n \nI've watched Warren for decades. Warren has learned a lot, which has\nallowed him to [expand his circle of competence so he could invest in\nsomething like PetroChina. If you're going to be an investor, you're going to\nmake some investments where you don't have all the experience you need.\nBut if you keep trying to get a little better over time, you'll start to make\ninvestments that are virtually certain to have a good outcome. The keys are\ndiscipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf-you have to work\non it. \nIf you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. \n \nCircle of Competence and Its Boundaries \n \nThere are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, our, and too\ntough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the \"too tough\"\nbasket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and focus\non that. \nIf you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn't be a competence if\nyou didn't know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you've passed\nthe boundary is] a question that almost answers itself. \n \nCost of Capital and Opportunity Costs\n\f\n[Buffett: Charlie and I don't know our cost of capital. It's taught at business\nschools, but we're skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we\ncan with the capital that we have. We measure everything against our\nalternatives. I've never seen a cost-of-capital calculation that made sense to\nme. Have you, Charlie?] \nNever. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent\npeople make decisions based on opportunity costs-in other words, it's your\nalternatives that matter. That's how we make all of our decisions. The rest of\nthe world has gone off on some kick-there's even a cost of equity capital. A\nperfectly amazing mental malfunction. \n \nObviously, consideration of costs is key, including opportunity costs. Of\ncourse, capital isn't free. It's easy to figure out your cost of borrowing, but\ntheorists went bonkers on the cost of equity capital. They say that if you're\ngenerating a one hundred percent return on capital, then you shouldn't\ninvest in something that generates an eighty percent return on capital. It's\ncrazy. \n \nValue of Forecasts \n \nPeople have always had this craving to have someone tell them the future.\nLong ago, kings would hire people to read sheep guts. There's always been\na market for people who pretend to know the future. Listening to today's\nforecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the\nsheep guts. It happens over and over and over.\n\f\nIPOs \n \nIt is entirely possible that you could use our mental models to find good\nIPOs to buy. There are countless IPOs every year, and I'm sure that there are\na few cinches that you could jump on. But the average person is going to\nget creamed. So if you think you're talented, good luck. \nIPOs are too small for us, or too high tech-we won't understand them. So, if\nWarren's looking at them, I don't know about it. \n \nComments on the Market \n \nStocks, Rembrandts, and Bubbles \n \nStocks are valued partly like bonds, based on roughly rational projections of\nproducing future cash' But they are also valued partly like Rembrandt\npaintings, purchased mostly because their prices have gone up so far. This\nsituation, combined with big \"wealth effects,\" at first up and later down, can\nconceivably produce much mischief. \n[April 2000] It's the most extreme in modern capitalism. In the 1930s, we\nhad the worst depression in 600 years. Today is almost as extreme in the\nopposite way.... We use the phrase \"wretched excess\" because the\nconsequences are wretched. \nBonds are much more rational. No one thinks a bond's value will soar to the\nmoon.\n\f\nFuture Market Returns \n \n[November 2000] If stocks compound at fifteen percent going forward, then\nit will be due to a big \"Rembrandt effect.\" This is not good. Look at what\nhappened in Japan, where stocks traded at fifty to sixty times earnings. This\nled to a ten-year depression. I think that was a special situation, though. My\nguess is that we won't get extreme \"Rembrandtization,\" and the returns\n[thereafter] will be six percent' If ['m wrong, it could be for a bad reason. If\nstocks trade more like Rembrandts in the future, then stocks will rise, but\nthey will have no anchors. In this case, it's hard to predict how far, how\nhigh, and how long it will last. \n[April 2001] I think generally that American investors should reduce their\nexpectations. People aren't being a little stupid, but massively stupid. No\none has an interest in saying this though. \n[May 2001] We are nor in a hog-heaven period. The investment game is\ngetting more and more comPetitive. \n \nI don't know if we'll ever see stocks in general at the mouth-watering levels\nthat we saw in 1973-74 or even tn 1982. I think there's a very excellent\nchance that neither Warren or I will see those opportunities again, but that's\nnot all bad. We 'll just keep plugging away. \n[Buffett: It's not out of [the realm of possibility though. You can never\npredict what markets will do. In Japan, a ten-year bond is yielding five-\neighths of one percent. Who could have ever imagined that?]\n\f\nIf that could happen in Japan, something much less bad, could happen in the\nU.S. We could be in for a period in which the average fancy-paid\ninvestment advisor just can't do very well. \n \nCurrent Outlook \n \n[May 2004] In terms of the general climate, I think it's pretty miserable for\nanyone who likes easy, sure money. Common stocks may be reasonably\nfairly valued, but they are not overwhelming bargains. Our cash is speaking\nfor itself. If we had a lot of wonderful ideas, we wouldn't have so much\ncash. Berkshire and Wesco are full of cash that we don't know what to do\nwith. Berkshire has $70 billion if you count the bonds, and Wesco is\ndrowning in cash. It's the most extreme it's ever been. In the past, we've just\nbeen patient, and we were able to put it to work \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Two \n \nWe continue with the question of how Charlie monitors broad economic\ntrends and changes: \nQuestion: \"What macro statistics do you regularly monitor or find useful in\nyour attempt to understand the broader economic landscape?\" \nAnswer: \"None. I find by staying abreast of our Berkshire subsidiaries and\nby regularly reading business newspapers and magazines, I am exposed to\nan enormous amount of material at the micro level. I find that what I see\ngoing on there pretty much informs me about what's happening at the macro\nlevel.\"\n\f\nCritique on Corporate Management \n \nEarnings Manipulation and Accounting Shenanigans \n \nWith so much money riding on reported numbers, human nature is to\nmanipulate them. And with so many doing it, you get Serpico effects, where\neveryone rationalizes that it's okay because everyone else is doing it. It is\nalways thus. Now, it's chain-letter mechanics. Because it's mixed with\nlegitimate activities like venture capital, it looks respectable. But we're\nmixing respectable activity with disrespectable activity-hence my comment\nat the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting about if you mix raisins with\nturds, you've still got turds. There is nothing in accounting that can prevent\nunscrupulous managers from engaging in a chain-letter type fraud. \n \nSpotting Crooked Managements \n \nBernie Ebbers and Ken Lay were caricatures-they were easy to spot. They\nwere almost psychopaths. But it's much harder to spot problems at\ncompanies like Royal Dutch [Shell]. \nBut we don't learn because I'd still expect that Exxon's figures are fair. I\nwant to make an apology. Last night, referring to some of our modern\nbusiness tycoons I said that when they're talking, they're lying, and when\nthey're quiet, they're stealing. This wasn't my witticism; it was used long\nago] to describe the robber barons.\n\f\nCorporate America's Addiction to Extraordinary Charges \n \nIf it happens every year like clockwork, what's so extraordinary about it? \n \nCorporate Governance \nThe cause of reform is hurt not helped when an activist makes an idiotic\nsuggestion like saying that having Warren on the board of Coke is contrary\nto the interests of Coke. Nutty behavior undermines their cause. \n \nCritique of the Money Management Business \n \nFlawed Incentives \n \nThe general systems of money management [today] require people to\npretend to do something they can't do and like something they don't. [it's a\nterrible way to spend your life, but it's very well paid. \n \nNo Value Added \n \nMutual funds charge two percent per year and then brokers switch people\nbetween funds, costing another three to four percentage points. The poor\nguy in the general public is getting a terrible product from the professionals.\nI think it's disgusting. It's much better to be part of a system that delivers\nvalue to the people who try the product. But if it makes money, we tend to\ndo it in this country."

This\ndoesn't mean there aren't some wonderful, intelligent people on Wall Street-\nthere are, like those in this room-but everyone I know has to fight his own\nfirm [to do the right thing. \nThe general culture of investment banking has deteriorated over the years.\nWe did a $6 million deal years ago for Diversified Retailing, and we were\nrigorously and intelligently screened. The bankers cared and wanted to\nprotect their clients. \nThe culture now is that anything that can be sold for a profit will be. \"Can\nyou sell it?\" is the moral test, and that's not an adequate test. \n \n132 \n \nSalomon Case Study \n \nIt's amazing what goes on Solomon was at least disciplined and rational as\nother investment banks, but by the end Solomon was begging for\ninvestment business from Robert Maxwell whose nickname was the\nbouncing Czech.

( editor's note\nunlike most creditors Solomon did eventually get paid as Charlie Puth Shit\nit was a minor miracle we didn't deserve to get it back) \nAn investment banker earning would be increased in a significant way if he\nwrote a few more tickets to Maxwell you have to control this if guys can\nmake money by bringing dubious things in the door \n \nNormandy America Case Study \n \nWarren and Charlie chuckled to themselves as they recalled Salomon doing\nbusiness with another shady character they didn't name. At the 2002 annual\nmeeting, however, Charlie identified the company as Normandy America\nInc., whose IPO Salomon had to pull before money exchanged hands when\nthey discovered the promoter had completely manufactured his record.\nAccording to a report on the SEC's website, \"Normandy's stock commenced\ntrading on the NASDAQ National Market System on August 15, 1995. One\nday later, Normandy withdrew its offering from the market and rescinded\nall trades.\" \nThat was a wonderful experience [dripping with sarcasm]. Warren, Lou\nSimpson, and I were all on the board [of Salomon], we were the largest\nshareholders, and we said, \"Don't do business with this guy.\" But they\nignored us and said that the underwriting committee had approved it.\n\f\n[Buffett: He had a neon sign on him saying \"CROOK.\" He did go to jail.\nIncidentally, he claimed to have owned a lot of berkshire stock and to have\nmade a lot of money on it, but I checked the shareholder records and\ncouldn't see it. It could have been in street name, but for a block that big, I\nthink I would have found it (so he was probably lying about his Berkshire\nholdings). \n \nCritique of Accountants  \n \nDemise of Ethics Among the Major Accounting Firms \n \nWhen I was younger, the major accounting firms were quite ethical places,\nand nobody got filthy rich. But in the space of twenty-five years, they sold\nout to terrible behavior, one little step at a time. Once you start doing\nsomething bad, then it's easy to take the next step-and in the end, you're a\nmoral sewer. The idea that the major accounting firms of the country would\nsell obviously fraudulent tax shelters. . . . \nToo many law and accounting firms get roped into shady things. For\nexample, tax shelters, with their contingency fees and secrecy, are a total\nabomination. You'll better understand the evil of top audit firms starting to\nsell fraudulent tax shelters when I tell you that one told me that they're\nbetter [than the others] because they only sold the schemes] to their top\ntwenty clients, so no one would notice. \n \nAggressive Accounting\n\f\nWe're so horrified by aggressive accounting [that is rampant in Corporate\nAmerica] that we reach for ways to be conservative. It helps our business\ndecisions and protects Berkshire. How did we get in situations where we're\nall so close to the line? Creative accounting is an absolute curse to a\ncivilization. One could argue that double-entry bookkeeping was one of\nhistory's great advances. Using accounting for fraud and folly is a disgrace.\nIn a democracy, it often takes a scandal to trigger reform. Enron was the\nmost obvious example of a business culture gone wrong in a long, long\ntime. \n \nMisuse of EBITDA \n \nI think that, every time you see the word EBITDA [earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization, you should substitute the words\n\"bullshit earnings.\" \n \nArthur Andersen \n \nI regard [what happened to the innocent employees of Arthur Andersen] as\nvery unfair, but capitalism without failure is like religion without hell.\nWhen it gets this bad and there's a lack of systems for control-which Arthur\nAndersen didn't have-maybe a firm should just go down. \nWe couldn't do anything that would bring down Berkshire. Arthur Andersen\nwas particularly vulnerable because it was a partnership. A partnership must\nbe extra careful in its behavior, choosing clients, etc.\n\f\nThe Scandal of American Pension Fund Accounting \nThe current practice [of using unrealistically high assumptions for pension\nplan returns] is a dumb and improper way to handle things. But if you talk\nto management, their eyes glaze over even before hostility comes, \n \nPension Fund accounting is drifting into scandal by using an realistic\nassumptions it's human nature to extrapolate the recent past into the future\nbut it is terrible that management go along with it. \n \nIBM just raised its return expectations for its pension fund to ten percent.\n[Year 2000] Most companies are at nine percent We think six percent is\nmore realistic. [Company leaders] may believe it-they're honest people-but\nsubconsciously they believe it because they want to believe it. It makes\nearnings good so they can promote the stock. \n \nthe reason Accountants don't say anything is best summed up by the saying,\n\"Whose bread I eAt, his song I sing.\" I think you're getting very foolish\nnumbers in American Accounting. I don't think it's willful dishonesty but it\nmight as well be. \n \nBad Accounting Leads to Immorality \nPeople who have loose accounting standards are just inviting perfectly\nhorrible behavior in other people. And it's a sin, it's an absolute sin. If you\ncarry bushel baskets full of money through the ghetto, and made it easy to\nsteal, that would be a considerable human sin because you'd be causing a lot\nof bad behavior, and the bad behavior would spread. Similarly, an\n\f\ninstitution that uses sloppy accounting commits a real human sin, and it's\nalso a dumb way to do business. \n \nCritique of Stock Options \n \nStock Options as Compensation \n \nIf you look at the impact of stock options, you'll see a lot of terrible\nbehavior. To give a lot of options to a CEO who built the business and is in\nhis sixties, to incent loyalty, is demented. Would the doctors at the Mayo\nClinic or the lawyers at Cravath who are in their sixties work harder if they\nhad options? \nAs our shareholders know our system is different from most big\ncorporations. We think it's less capricious. 'the-stock option system may\ngive extraordinary rewards to some people who did nothing, and give\nnothing to those who deserve a lot. Except where we inherit it [a stock\noption program], we don't use it. \n \nValuing Options and the Black-Scholes Model \n \nBlack-Scholes works for short-term options, but if it's a long-term option\nand you think you know something [about the underlying asset], it's insane\nto use Black-Scholes. Black-Scholes is a know-nothing system. If you\nknow nothing about value-only price-then Black-Scholes is a pretty good\nguess at what a ninety-day option might be worth. But the minute you get\ninto longer periods of time, it's crazy to get into Black-Scholes."

You can push credit too far, do a dumb acquisition,\nleverage yourself excessively-it's not just derivatives [that can bring about\nyour downfall]. \nMaybe it's unique to us, but we're quite sensitive to financial risks.\nFinancial institutions make us nervous when they're trying to do well. \n \nWe are exceptionally goosey of leveraged financial institutions. If they start\ntalking about how good risk management is, it makes us nervous. \n \nWe fret way earlier than other people. We've left a lot of money on the table\nthrough early fretting. It's the way we are-you'll just have to live with it. \n \nDerivatives \n \nThe system is almost insanely irresponsible. And what people think are\nfixes aren't really fixes. It's so complicated I can't do it justice here-but you\ncan't believe the trillions of dollars involved. You can't believe the\ncomplexity. You can't believe how difficult it is to do the accounting. You\ncan't believe how big the incentives are to have wishful thinking about\nvalues and wishful thinking about ability to clear. \n \nPeople don't think about the consequences of the consequences. People start\nby trying to hedge against interest rate changes. which is very difficult and\ncomplicated. Then, the hedges make the [reported profits] lumpy. So then\nthey use new derivatives to smooth this. Well, now you've morphed into\n\f\nlying. This turns into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. This happens to vast,\nsophisticated corporations. Somebody has to step in and say, \"We're not\ngoing to do it-it's just too hard.\" \nI think a good litmus test of the mental and moral quality at any large\ninstitution [with significant derivatives exposure] would be to ask them,\n\"Do you really understand your derivatives book?\" Anyone who says yes is\neither crazy or lying. \nIt's easy to see [the dangers] when you talk about [what happened with] the\nenergy derivatives-they went kerflooey. When [the companies] reached for\nthe assets that were on their books, the money wasn't there. When it comes\nto financial assets, we haven't had any such denouement, and the accounting\nhasn't changed, so the denouement (the final part of a play, movie, or\nnarrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are\nexplained or resolved) is ahead of us. \nDerivatives are full of clauses that say if one party's credit gets downgraded,\nthen it has to put up collateral. It's like margin-you can go broke [just\nputting up more margin]. In attempting to protect themselves, they've\nintroduced instability. Nobody seems to recognize what a disaster of a\nsystem they've created. It's a demented system. \nIn engineering, people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial\nworld, people don't give a damn about safety. They let it balloon and\nballoon and balloon. It's aided by false accounting.

    "raw_text": "158 \n \nSimpson on Munger \n \nWhen I first met Charlie Munger, I knew he was a unique individual, but I\ndidn't realize just how unique until I knew him better. \n \nI have now known Charlie for twenty-five years and have had the\nopportunity to observe him under a wide range of circumstances, including\nthe aftermath of the Salomon bond crisis of the early nineties where we\nwere both serving on the board of directors. I can attest that Charlie has a\ncombination of characteristics that I have never seen in any other single\nindividual. He has an extraordinary and deep intelligence across a broad\nrange of interests, and he never seems to forget anything, no matter how\narcane or trivial. On top of these attributes is his absolute commitment to\nhonesty, ethics, and integrity-Charlie never \"grabs\" for himself and can be\ntrusted without reservation. If that's not enough, he has a temperament\ncoward investing that can only be described as ideal: unyielding patience,\ndiscipline, and self-control-Charlie just doesn't crack or compromise on his\nprinciples, no matter how stressful the situation. \nHow fortunate we have all been to have this duo of Charlie Munger and\nWarren Buffett as our partners, teachers, and role models for all these years.\nThese are truly exceptional men. \n \nMunger on Simpson\n\f\nLou Simpson is a highly intelligent and hOnOrable man. I was pleased that\nin the annual letter to shareholders this year (2005), Warren printed Lou's\ntwenty five year investment track record. It's not unheard of to beat the\nmarket averages for a couple of years, maybe even five or ten years. But,\nimagine beating the S&P 500 by an average annual gain of 6.8 percent over\ntwenty-five years! 'this extraordinary track record speaks for itself-Lou has\none of the greatest investment minds of our time. He is, as Warren says, \"a\nshoo-in for the investment Hall of Fame.\" \nI remember well the dot-com boom of the late nineties and how Lou\nhandled it. You can't believe the pressure that he was under, year after year,\nas the world seemed to be reaping enormous gains while he, correctly,\navoided the bubble altogether, staying true to fundamentals. Lou was a\nwonderful example in that period-intelligent, honorable, and true to his\nfundamentals. \n \nSinegal on Munger \n \nI had the pleasure of meeting Charlie eight years ago when he agreed to\nhave lunch with me in Los Angeles at the California Club. My purpose was\nto convince him to consider joining the Costco board of directors. I liked\nhim from the moment we met when he told me how much he enjoyed\nshopping at Costco; and despite our being interrupted continuously by the\nother 500-plus people dining there that day, who all felt compelled to say\nhello to Charlie and whom Charlie identified by name in almost every\ninstance, we managed to have a great conversation. First off, Charlie was\nastute enough to recognize what a great value Costco membership\n\f\nrepresented. Later, of course, I learned of Charlie's reputation for thriftiness,\nwhich clarified Costco's appeal, but, more importantly his\nstraightforwardness and common sense business acumen came through loud\nand clear. \nLater when he called to accept the position on the board, he referred to\nhimself as a septuagenarian. Pretty fancy description to share with someone\nfrom the warehouse industry: I was flattered he thought I understood him.\nSince then he has provided everything that can be expected from a director.\nHis insight, questioning, and support have made Costco a better-governed\nand better-operated company. As an extra bonus, we are treated to regular\ndoses of the Munger wit-we are lucky people! \n \nMunger on Sinegal \n \nYou just wouldn't believe how efficient and sophisticated Costco's\nwarehouse OperatiOn is. Jim Sinegal is a fabulous business operator-like a\nCarnegie, Rockefeller, or James J. Hill. I consider him to be one of the top\nfive retailers of the past century. He's that good. He works eighty hours a\nweek and sets a terrific example for his entire organization in terms of work\nethic, integrity, loyalty, and selflessness. He's a moral leader as well as a\npractical leader. These are not minor virtues. We have our own living,\nbreathing Sam Walton at Costco. \n \nChapter 4 : Eleven Talks"

    "raw_text": "Charlie Munger is not the least bit shy when it comes to offering both frank\ncriticism and constructive advice. when he sets his sights on an issue-be it a\ncorrupt business practice, an academic failing, or a financial scandal-he lets\nloose with both barrels. Which is not to say he spends all his time focused\non life's failings. He is equally at home discussing the values of lifelong\nlearning or the joys of a successful marriage. But whatever the topic,\nCharlie is apt to tell it like it is, which is exactly what he has done in over\ntwo decades of public speaking. Here then are eleven of Charlie's best talks,\nincluding a special compilation he has prepared exclusively for this book.\nEnjoy. \n \nIn a vow that students the world over may hope he renounces, Charlie\ndelivered \"the one and only graduation speech I will ever make\" in 1986 at\nthe Harvard School in Los Angeles. The occasion was the graduation of\nPhilip Munger, the last of five Munger family sons to matriculate at this\nprep school (originally an all-boys institution and now the coeducational\nschool called Harvard-Westlake). Despite Charlie's self-effacing\nprocestations about then lacking \"significant public-speaking experience,\"\nhe demonstrates imposing rhetorical talents in this short speech. We also get\na good taste of both Charlie's value system and wit. Most graduation\nspeakers choose to lay out a prescription for attaining a happy life. Charlie,\nusing the inversion principle he recommends in the speech, compellingly\nmakes the opposite case by setting forth what a graduate may do to reach a\nstate of misery. For those of you who want to remain unenlightened and\nmirthless, do not, under any circumstances, read this selection."

    "raw_text": "Harvard School Commencement Speech \nJune 13, 1986 \n \nNow that Headmaster Berrisford has selected one of the oldest and longest-\nserving trustees to make a commencement speech, it behooves the speaker\nto address two questions in every mind: \n \n1) Why was such a selection made? \n2) How long is the speech going to last? \n \nI will answer the first question from long experience alongside Berrisford.\nHe is seeking enhanced reputation for our school in the manner of the man\nwho proudly displays his horse that can count to seven. The man knows that\ncounting to seven is not much of a mathematical feat, but he expects\napproval \nbecause doing so is creditable, considering the performer is a horse. \nThe second question, regarding the length of the speech, I am not going to\nanswer in advance. It world deprive your upturned faces of lively curiosity\nand obvious keen anticipation, which I prefer to remain, regardless of\nsource. \n \nBut I will tell you how my consideration of speech length created the\nsubject matter of the speech itself. I was puffed up when invited to speak.\nWhile not having significant public-speaking experience, I do hold a black\nbelt in chutzpah, and I immediately considered Demosthenes and Cicero as\nrole models and anticipated trying to earn a compliment like Cicero gave\n\f\nwhen asked which was his favorite among the orations of Demosthenes.\nCicero replied: \"The longest one.\" \n \nHowever, fortunately for this audience, I also thought of Samuel Johnson's\nfamous comment when he addressed Milton's poem Paradise Lost and\ncorrectly said, \"No one ever wished it longer.\" And that made me consider\nwhich of all the twenty Harvard School graduation speeches I had heard\nthat I had wished longer. There was only one such speech, given by Johnny\nCarson, specifying Carson's prescriptions for guaranteed misery in life. I,\ntherefore, decided to repeat Carson's speech but in expanded form with\nsome added prescriptions of my own. After all, I am much older than\nCarson was when he spoke and have failed and been miserable more often\nand in more ways than was possible for a charming humorist speaking at a\nyounger age. I am plainly well qualified to expand on Carson's theme. \n \nMarcus Tullius Cicero \nA poet, philosopher, rhetorician, and humorist, Cicero was also one of\nRome's great orators. Cicero viewed public service to be a Roman citizen”s\nhighest duty. He defended those unjustly accused by dictatorial leaders and\nbrought down corrupt governments. Late in life, he led the Senate’s\nunsuccessful battle against Antony, for which he paid with his life in 43\nBC. \n \nWhat Carson said was that he couldn't tell the graduating class how to be\nhappy, but he could tell them from personal experience how to guarantee\nmisery.\n\f\nCarson's prescription for sure misery included: \nl. Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception; \n2. Envy and \n3. Resentment. \n \nI can still recall Carson's absolute conviction as he told how he had tried\nthese things on occasion after occasion and had become miserable every\ntime. \nIt is easy to understand Carson's first prescription for misery-ingesting\nchemicals. I add my voice. The four closest friends of my youth were\nhighly intelligent, ethical, humorous types, favored in person and\nbackground. Two are long dead, with alcohol a contributing factor, and a\nthird is a living alcoholic-if you call that living. \n \nCarson said he couldn't tell the graduating class how to be happy, but he\ncould tell them from personal exPerience how to guarantee misery. \n \nWhile susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us through a\nsubtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until\nthey are too strong to be broken. And yet, I have yet to meet anyone, in over\nsix decades of life, whose life was worsened by fear and avoidance of such\na deceptive \npathway to destruction. \nEnvy, of course, joins chemicals in winning some sort of quantity prize for\ncausing misery. It was wreaking havoc long before it got a bad press in the\n\f\nlaws of Moses. If you wish to retain the contribution of envy to misery, I\nrecommend that you never read any of the biographies of that good\nChristian, Samuel Johnson, because his life demonstrates in an enticing way\nthe possibility and advantage of transcending envy. \n \nResentment has always worked for me exactly as it worked for Carson. I\ncannot recommend it highly enough to you if you desire misery. Johnson\nspoke well when he said that life is hard enough to swallow without\nsqueezing in the bitter rind of resentment. For those of you who want\nmisery, I also recommend refraining from practice of the Disraeli\ncompromise, designed for people who find it impossible to quit resentment\ncold turkey. Disraeli, as he rose to become one of the greatest prime\nministers, learned to give up vengeance as a motivation for action, but he\ndid retain some outlet for resentment by putting the names of people who\nwronged him on pieces of paper in a drawer. Then, from time to time, he\nreviewed these names and took pleasure in noting the way the world had\ntaken his enemies down without his assistance. \n \nJohnson spoke well when he said that life is hard enough to swallow\nwithout squeezing in the bitter rind of resentment \n \nOne of the greatest poets of the English language, John Milton was best\nknown for his epic poem Paradise Lost(1667). His powerful prose and the\neloquence of his poetry had an immense influence' especially on eighteenth-\ncentury verse. Milton also published pamphlets defending civil and"

    "raw_text": "religious rights. To Samuel Johnson's point about Milton's long-windedness,\nParadise Lost runs to twelve \"books\" and thousands of line \n \nAddiction can happen to any of us through a subtle process where the bonds\nof degradation are too light to be felt until when they are too strong to be\nbroken. \n \nWell, so much for Carson's three prescriptions. Here are four more\nprescriptions from Munger: \n \nFirst, be unreliable. Do not faithfully do what you have engaged to do. If\nyou will only master this one habit, you will more than counterbalance the\ncombined effect of all your virtues, how so ever great. If you like being\ndistrusted and excluded from the best human contribution and company,\nthis prescription is for you. Master this one habit, and you will always play\nthe role of the hare in the fable, except that instead of being outrun by one\nfine turtles, you will be outurn by hordes and hordes of mediocre turtles and\neven some mediocre turtles on crutches. \n \nI must Warn you that if you don't follow my first Prescription it may be\nhard to end up miserable even if you start disadvantaged. I had a roommate\nin college who was and is severely dyslexic but he is perhaps the most\nreliable man I have ever known. He has had a wonderful Life so far,\noutstanding wife and children, chief executive of a multibillion dollar\ncorporation. If you want to avoid a conventional, main-culture,\n\f\nestablishment result of this kind, you simply can't count on your other\nhandicaps to hold you back if you persist in being reliable. \n \nI cannot here Pass by reference to a life described as wonderful sofa without\nreinforcing the sofa aspects of the human condition by repeating the\nremarks of coresus, once the richest king In the world later in ignominious\ncaptivity as you prepared to be burnt alive he said well now do I remember\nthe words of the Historian in salon “ No man's life should be accounted a\nhappy one until it's over“ \n \nMy second Prescription for miseries to learn everything you possibly can\nfrom your own experiences minimizing what you learn vicariously from the\ngood and bad experience of others, living and dead. This prescription is a\nsure shot producer cf misery and second-rate achievement. \nYou can see: the results Of not learning From others mistakes by simply\nlooking about you How little originality there is in the common disasters of\nmankind drunk driving deaths reckless driving mamimings incurable\nvenereal diseases, conversion of bright college students into brainwashed\nzombies as members of destructive cults, business failures through\nrepetition of obvious mistakes made by predecessors, various forms of\ncrowd folly, and so on. I recommend as a memory clue to finding the way\nto real trouble from heedless, unoriginal error the modern saying: \"If at first\nyou don't succeed, well, so much for hang gliding.\" \n \nThe other aspect of avoiding vicarious wisdom is the rule for not learning\nfrom the best work done before yours. The prescription is to become as non\n\f\neducated as you reasonably can.  \n \nPerhaps you will better see the type of non miserable result you can thus\navoid if I render a short historical account. There once was a man who\nassiduously mastered the work of his best predecessors, despite a poor start\nand very tough time in analytical geometry. Eventually, his own work\nattracted wide attention, and he said of his work: \n \n\"If I have seen a little farther than other men. it is because I stood on the\nshoulders of giants.\" \n \nThe bones of that man lie buried now, in Westminster Abbey, under an\nunusual inscription: \n \n\"Here lie the remains of all that was mortal in Sir Isaac Newton.\" \n \nFranklin on Vicarious Learning \n \n\"If you will not hear reason, she will surely rap your knuckles.\" \"They that\nwon't be counseled, can't be helped.\" \"Experience keeps a dear school, but\nfools will learn in no other and scarce in that; for it is true, we may give\nadvice, but we cannot give conduct.\" \n \nSir Isaac Newton (1642_1727)  \nAt birth in Lincolnshire, England, Newton was so tiny and frail that he was\nnot expected to live. Yet he lived into his eighties. During his young\n\f\nadulthood, Newton made tremendous discoveries in general mathematics,\nalgebra, geometry calculus, optics, and celestial mechanics. Most famous\namong these discoveries was his description of gravity. The publication of\nhis book The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 1687\nmarked the peak of Newton's creative career. \n \nMy third prescription to you for misery is to go down and stay down when\nyou get your first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle of life.\nBecause there is so much adversity out there, even for the lucky and wise,\nthis will guarantee that, in due course, you will be permanently mired in\nmisery. Ignore at all cost the lesson contained in the accurate epitaph\nwritten for himself by Epictetus: \"Here lies Epictetus, a slave, maimed in\nbody, the ultimate in poverty, and favored by the gods.\" \n \n\"Invert always invert,\" Jacobi said. He knew that it is in the nature of things\nthat many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed\nbackward. \n \nMy final prescription to you for a life of fuzzy thinking and infelicity is to\nignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said,\n\"I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there.\" Most\npeople smile (as you did) at the rustic's ignorance and ignore his basic\nwisdom. If my experience is any guide, the rustic's approach is to be\navoided at all cost by someone bent on misery. To help fail, you should\ndiscount as mere quirk, with no useful message, the method of the rustic,\nwhich is the same one used in Carson's speech."

    "raw_text": "What Carson did was to approach the study of how to create X by turning\nthe question backward, that is, by studying how to create non-X. The great\nalgebraist, Jacobi, had exactly the same approach as Carson and was known\nfor his constant repetition of one phrase: \"Invert, always invert.\" It is in the\nnature \nof things, as Jacobi knew, that many hard problems are best solved only\nwhen they are addressed backward. For instance, when almost everyone\nelse was trying to revise the electromagnetic laws of Maxwell to be\nconsistent with the motion laws of Newton, Einstein discovered special\nrelativity as he made a 180 degree turn and revised Newton's laws to fit\nMaxwell's \n \nIt is my opinion, as a certified biography nut, that Charles Robert Darwin\nwould have ranked near the middle of the Harvard School graduating class\nof 1986. Yet he is now famous in the history of science. This is precisely the\ntype of example you should learn nothing from if bent on minimizing your\nresults from your own Endowment. \n \nDarwin's result was due in large measure to his working method, which\nviolated all my rules for misery and particularly emphasized a backward\ntwist in that he always gave priority attention to evidence tending to\ndisconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had. In\ncontrast, most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process\nnew and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains\nintact. They become people of whom Philip Wylie observed: \"You couldn't\n\f\nsqueeze a dime between what they already know and what they will never\nlearn.\" \n \nThe life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided\nby extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the\nonly player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey, \n \nThe life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided\nby extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the\nonly player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey, \n \nIf you minimize objectivity, you ignore not only a lesson from Darwin but\nalso one from Einstein. Einstein said that his successful theories came from\n\"Curiosity, concentration, perseverance, and self-criticism.\" And by self\ncriticism, he meant the testing and destruction of his own well-loved ideas.\nFinally, minimizing objectivity will help you lessen the compromises and\nburden of owning worldly goods because objectivity does not work only for\ngreat physicists and biologists. It also adds power to the work of a plumbing\ncontractor in Bemidji. Therefore, if you interpret being true to yourself as\nrequiring that you retain every notion of your youth, you will be safely\nunderway, not only toward maximizing ignorance, but also toward whatever\nmisery can be obtained through unpleasant experiences in business. \n \nIt is hitting that a backward sort of speech end with a backward sort of\ntoast, inspired by Elihu Root's repeated accounts of how the dog went to"

He had a popular radio show in Omaha for years and\nclaimed the city as his hometown. For thirty years , from 1962 to L992, he\nentertained millions as host of NBC television's The Tonight Show. His\nshow featured thousands of authors, filmmakers, actors, singers*and stand-\nup comedians, of course, many of whose careers he launched, \n \nTalk One Revisited \n \nAs I review in 2006 this talk made in 1986, I would not revise a single idea.\nIf anything, I now believe even more strongly that  \n(1) reliability is essential for progress in life and (2) while quantum\nmechanics is unlearnable for a vast majority, reliability can be learned to\ngreat advantage by almost Anyone. \n \nIndeed, I have often made myself unpopular on elite college campuses\npushing this reliability theme. What I say is that McDonald's is one of our\nmost admirable institutions. Then, as signs of shock come to surrounding\nfaces, I explain that McDonald's, providing first jobs to millions of\nteenagers, many troubled, over the years, has successfully taught most of\nthem the one lesson they most need: to show up reliably for responsible\nwork. Then I usually go on to say that if the elite campuses were as\n\f\nsuccessful as McDonald's in teaching sensibly, we would have a better\nworld. \n \nAvoiding Life's Pitfalls a la Kipling \n \nIf you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming\nit on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make\nallowance for their doubting too, If You can wait and not be tired by\nwaiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give\nway to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too revise ... \nIf You can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings-nor\nlose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving Friends can hurt you; If\nall men count with you, but none too much, if you can fill the unforgiving\nminute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and\neverything that's in it, And-which is more you'll be a Man, my son! \n \nExcerpted From the poem \"If,\" which Charlie has always admired \n \n177 \n \nWell-known because it was published in Outstanding Investor Digest May\n5, 1995), this talk was given in 1994 to Professor Guilford Babcock's\nbusiness class at the University of Southern California. Charlie ranges in\nthe talk from education systems to psychology to the importance of\npossessing both common and uncommon sense. Dissecting business\nmanagement, he brilliantly describes psychological impacts that can\n\f\ndamage or benefit a firm. He also presents an outstanding set of principles\nfor investment, business management, and-most importantly from Charlie's\nperspective-decision making in everyday life. \n \nYour time investment in reading this talk will be paid back quickly via the\neffect it will have on your own decision making abilities. \n \nTalk two \nA Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom\nas It Relates to Investment Management\nand Business \n \nThe university of Southern California Marshall School of Business, April\n14, 1994 \nI am going to play a minor trick on you today because the subject of my\ntalk is the art of stock I picking as a subdivision of the art of worldly\nWiSdOm. 'that enables me to start talking about worldly wisdom-a much\nbroader topic that interests me because I think all too little of it is delivered\nby \nmodern educational systems, at least in an effective way. \nAnd, therefore, the talk is sort of along the lines that some behaviorist\npsychologists call \"Grandma's rule\"-after the wisdom of Grandma when she\nsaid that you have to eat the carrots before you get the dessert.\n\f\nThe carrot part of this talk is about the general subject of worldly wisdom,\nwhich \nis a pretty good way to start. After all, the theory of modern education is\nthat you need a general education before you specialize. And I think, to\nsome extent, before \nyou're going to be a great stock picker, you need some general education. \n \nthe talk is sort of along the lines that some behaviorist psychologists call\n\"Grandma's rule\"-after the wisdom of Grandma when she said that you have\nto eat the carrots before you get the dessert. \n \nSo, emphasizing what I sometimes waggishly call remedial worldly\nwisdom, I'm \ngoing to start by waltzing you through a few basic notions. \nWhat is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can't\nreally know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang\n'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you\ndon't have them in a usable \nForm. \n \nYou've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your\nexperience-both vicarious and direct-on this latticework of models. You\nmay have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what\nis remembered. Well, they fail in school and fail in life. You've got to hang\nexperience on a \nlatticework of models in your head.\n\f\nWhat are the models? Well, the first rule is that you've got to have multiple\nmodels-because if you have just one or two that you're using, the nature of\nhuman psychology is such that you'll torture reality so that it fits your\nmodels, or at least you'll think it does. You become the equivalent of a\nchiropractor, who, of course, is the great boon in medicine. \n \nIt's like the old saying to the man with only a hammer every problem\nlooks like a navy and of course that's the way the chiropractor goes\nabout practicing medicine but that's a perfectly disastrous way to\nthink and a perfectly disastrous way to operate in the world so you\nhave gone to have multiple models \n \nAnd the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all\nthe wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic\ndepartment that is why poetry processes by and large are so unwise\nin a worldly sense they don't have enough models in their head so\nyou have got to models across the pair array of disciplines \n \nAnd you may say, \"My God, this is already getting way too tough, but\nfortunately it is not that because 80 to 90 important models will carry\nabout 90% of the freight in making you a worldly wise person and of\nthose, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight \n \nPoetry processors by and large are so unwise in the world lessons\nthey don't have enough models in their head so you have got to\nhave models across the wide array of disciplines"

    "raw_text": "So let's briefly review what kind of models and techniques\nconstitutes the basic knowledge that everybody has to have before\nthey proceed to being really good at a narrow 8 lines stock picking \n \nFirst there's mathematics. Obviously, you've got to be able to , handle\nnumbers and quantities basic. arithmetic. And the great useful model, after\ncompound interest. is the elementary math of permutations and\ncombinations. And that was taught in my day in the sophomore year in high\nschool. I suppose by now, in great private schools, it's probably down to the\neighth grade or so. \n \nThe basic neural network of the brain is there through broad genetic and\ncultural evolution. And it's not Fermat/Pascal. It uses a very crude, shortcut-\ntype of approximation, It's very simple algebra. And it was all worked out\nin the course of about one year in correspondence between Pascal and\nFermat. They worked it out casually in a series of letters. \n \nIt's not that hard to learn. What is hard is to get so you use it routinely\nalmost every day of your life. The Fermat/Pascal system is dramatically\nconsonant with the way that the world works. And it's fundamental truth. So\nyou simply have to have the technique. \n \nInvited by French aristocrat Chevalier de Merde to help resolve a gambling\ndispute in the mid-seventeenth century mathematicians Pierre de Fermat\n\f\nand Blaise Pascal laid the foundations for probability theory in a series of\nletters. \nDe Mird's question concerned bets on rolls of a die that at least one \"6\"\nwould appear during four rolls. From experience, he knew he would win\nmore often than lose at this game. As a diversion, he changed the game to a\nbet that he would get a total of 12, or a double \"6,\" on twenty-four rolls of\ntwo dice. The new game was less profitable than the old one. He asked the\nmathematicians to determine why this change occurred. \n \nMany educational institutions-although not nearly enough-have realized\nthis. \nAt Harvard Business School, the great quantitative thing that bonds the\nfirst-year class together is what they call \"decision tree theory.\" All they do\nis take high school algebra and apply it to real life problems. And the\nstudents love it. They're amazed to find that high school algebra works in\nlife. \n \nBy and large, as it works out, people can't naturally and automatically do\nthis. If you understand \nelementary psychology, the reason they can't is really quite simple: The\nbasic neural network of the brain \nis there through broad genetic and cultural evolution. And it's not\nFermat/Pascal. It uses a very crude, shortcut-type of approximation. It's got\nelements of Fermat/Pascal in it. However, it's not good. \nSo you have to learn in a very usable way this very elementary math and\nuse it routinely in life-just the way if you want to become a golfer, you can't\n\f\nuse the natural swing that broad evolution gave you. You have to learn to\nhave a certain grip and swing in a different way to realize your full potential\nas a golfer. \nIf you don't get this elementary but mildly unnatural, mathematics of\nelementary probability into your repertoire, then you go through a long life\nlike a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest \n \nIf you don't get this elementary but mildly unnatural, mathematics of\nelementary probability into your repertoire, then you go through a long life\nlike a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.  You're giving a huge\nadvantage to everybody else. \n \nOne of the advantages of a fellow like Buffett, whom I've worked with all\nthese years, is that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees and the\nelementary math of permutations and combinations. \n \nObviously, you have to know accounting. It's the language of practical\nbusiness life. It was a very useful thing to deliver to civilization. I've heard\nit came to civilization through Venice, which, of course, was once the great\ncommercial power in the Mediterranean. However, double-entry\nbookkeeping was a hell of an invention. \n \nAnd it's not that hard to undersTand. But you have to know enough about it\nto understand its limitations-because although accounting is the starting\nplace, it's only a crude approximation. And it's not very hard to understand\nits limitations. For example, everyone can see that you have to more or less\n\f\njust guess at the useful life of a jet airplane or anything like that. Just\nbecause you express the depreciation rate in neat numbers doesn't make it\nanything you really know. \nIn terms of the limitations of accounting, one of my favorite stories involves\na very great businessman named Carl Braun who created the C. E Braun\nEngineering Company. It designed and built oil refineries-which is very\nhard to do. And Braun would get them to come in on time and not blow up\nand have efficiencies and so forth. This is a major art. \n \nAnd Braun, being the thorough Teutonic type that he was, had a number of\nquirks. And one of them was that he took a look at standard accounting and\nthe way it was applied to building oil refineries, and he said, \"This is\nasinine.\" \nSo he threw all of his accountants out, and he took his engineers and said,\n\"Now, we'll devise our own system of accounting to handle this process.\"\nAnd, in due time, accounting adopted a lot of Carl Braun's notions. So he\nwas a formidably willful and talented man who demonstrated both the\nimportance of accounting and the importance of knowing its limitations. He\nhad another rule, from psychology, which, if you're interested in wisdom,\nought to be part of your repertoire-like the elementary mathematics of\npermutations and combinations. \n \nHis rule for all the Braun Company's communications was called the five\nWs-you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And\nif you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to\ndo something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact you\n\f\nwould get fired if you did it twice. You might ask why is that so important?\nWell, again, that's a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array\nknowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question,\nwhy, why, why, if you always tell people why, they'll understand it better,\nthey'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply.\nEven if they don't understand your reason, they'll be more likely to comply. \n \nif you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it\nmore important, and they'll be more likely to comply. \n \nSo there's an iron rule that just as you want to start getting worldly wisdom\nby asking why, why, why in communicating with other people about\neverything, you want to include why, why, why. Even if it's obvious, it's\nwise to stick in the why. Which models are the most reliable? Well,\nobviously, the models that come from hard science and engineering are the\nmost reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control-at least\nthe guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not\nprofessional engineers-is very much based on the elementary mathematics\nof Fermat and Pascal. It costs so much, and you get so much less likelihood\nof it breaking if you spend this much. It's all elementary high school\nmathematics. And an elaboration of that is what Deming brought to Japan\nfor all of that quality-control stuff. \n \nI don't think it's necessary for most people to be terribly facile in statistics.\nFor example, I'm not sure that I can even pronounce the Gaussian\ndistribution, although I know what it looks like and I know that events and\n\f\nhuge aspects of reality end up distributed that way. So I can do a rough\ncalculation. But if you ask me to work out something involving a Gaussian\ndistribution to ten decimal points, I can't sit down and do the math. I'm like\na poker player who's learned to play pretty well without mastering Pascal.\nAnd, by the way, that works well enough. But you have to understand that\nbell-shaped curve at least roughly as well as I do. And, of course, the\nengineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The\nengineering idea of breakpoints- that's a very powerful model, too. The\nnotion of a critical mass-that comes out of physics-is a very powerful\nmodel. \nAll of these things have great utility in looking at ordinary reality. And all\nof this cost-benefit analysis-hell, that's all elementary high school algebra.\nIt's just been dolled up a little bit with fancy lingo. \n \nAnd you can demonstrate that point quite simply: There's not a person in\nthis room viewing the \nwork of a very ordinary professional magician who doesn't see A lot of\nthings happening that are not happening and not see a lot of things\nhappening that are happening, I suppose the next most reliable models are\nfrom biology/physiology because, after all, all of us are programmed by our\ngenetic makeup to be much the same. And then when you get into\npsychology, of course, it gets very much more complicated. But it's an\nungodly important subject if you're going to have any worldly wisdom. \n \nAnd the reason why is that the perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in\nThe brain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to\n\f\ntake advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to miscalculate in\ncertain ways can cause you to see things that aren't there. \nNow you get into the cognitive function as distinguished from the\nperceptual function. And there, you are equally-more than equally in fact-\nlikely to be misled. Again, your brain has a shortage of circuitry and so\nforth-and it's taking all kinds of little automatic shortcuts. \nSo when circumstances combine in certain ways-or more commonly, your\nfellow man starts acting like the magician and manipulates you on purpose\nby causing you cognitive dysfunction-you're a patsy. \nAnd so just as a man working with a tool has to know its limitations, a man\nworking with his cognitive apparatus has to know its limitations. And this\nknowledge, by the way, can be used to control and motivate other people. \n \nThe mind of man at one and the same time is both the glory and the shame\nof the universe. \n \nSo the most useful and practical part of psychology-which I personally\nthink can be taught to any intelligent person in a week-is ungodly\nimportant. And nobody taught it to me, by the way. I had to learn it later in\nlife, one piece at a time. And it was fairly laborious. It's so elementary\nthough that, when it was all over, I just felt like a total horse's ass. \nAnd yeah, I'd been educated at Caltech and the Harvard Law School and so\nforth. So very eminent places miseducated people like you and me. \nThe elementary part of psychology-the psychology of misjudgment, as I\ncall it-is a terribly important thing to learn. There are about twenty little\nprinciples.\n\f\nAnd the interact, so it gets slightly complicated. But the guts of it is\nunbelievably important. \nvery smart people make totally bonkers mistakes by failing to pay heed to\nit. In fact, I've done it several times during the last two or three years in a\nvery important way. You never get totally over making silly mistakes. 'I-\nhere's another saying that comes from Pascal that I've always considered\none of the: really accurate observations in the history of thought. Pascal\nsaid, \"The mind of man at one and the same time is both the glory and the\nshame of the universe.\" \n \nAnd that's exactly right. It has this enormous power. However, it also has\nthese standard malfunctions that often cause it to reach wrong conclusions.\nIt also makes man extraordinarily subject to manipulation by others. For\nexample, roughly half of the army of Adolf Hitler was composed of\nbelieving Catholics. Given enough clever psychological manipulation, what\nhuman beings will do is quite interesting. \n \nI now use A kind of two-track analysis. \n \nPersonally, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First,\nwhat are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally\nconsidered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the\nbrain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things-which, by\nand large, are useful but which often misfunction?\n\f\nOne approach is rationality-the way you'd work out a bridge problem: by\nevalUating the real interests, the real probability, and so forth. And the other\nis to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious\nconclusions-many of which are wrong. \n \nNow we come to another somewhat less reliable form of human wisdom\nmicroeconomics. And here, I find it quite useful to think of a free market\neconomy-- partly free market economy-as sort of the equivalent of an\necosystem. \n \nJust as animals flourish in niches, similarly, people who specialize in the\nbusiness world-and get very good because they specialize-frequently find\ngood economics that they wouldn't get any other way. \n \nThis is a very unfashionable way of thinking because early in the days after\nDarwin came along, people like the robber barons assumed that the doctrine\nof the survival of the fittest aruthenticated them as deserving power-you\nknow, \"I'm the richest. 'therefore, I'm the Best. God's in his heaven, etc.\" \nAnd that reaction of the robber barons was so irritating to people that it\nmade it unfashionable to think of an economy as an ecosystem. But the\ntruth is that it is a lot like an ecosystem. And you get many of the same\nresults. \n \nJust as in an ecosystem, people who narrowly specialize can get terribly\ngood at occupying some little niche. Just as animals flourish in niches,\nsimilarly, people who specialize in the business world-and get very good\n\f\nbecause they specialize-frequently find good economics that they wouldn't\nget any other way... \nAnd once we get into microeconomics, we get into the concept of\nadvantages of scale. Now we're getting closer to investment analysis-\nbecause in terms of which businesses succeed and which businesses fail,\nadvantages of scale are ungodly important. \nFor example, one great advantage of scale taught in all of the business\nschools of the world is cost reductions along the so-called experience curve.\nJust doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human\nbeings, who are \ntrying to improve and are motivated by the incentives of capitalism, to do it\nmore and more efficiently. \n \nThe very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through\nyour operation, you get better at processing that volume, That's an\nenormous advantage. \n \nThe very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through\nyour operation, you get better at processing that volume. 'That's an\nenormous advantage. And it has a lot to do with which businesses succeed\nand fail. \nLet's go through a list-albeit an incomplete one-of possible advantages of\nscale. Some come from simple geometry. If you're building a great circular\ntank, obviously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the\nsurface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the\ncube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume\n\f\nper unit area of steel. And there are all kinds of things like that where the\nsimple geometry-the simple reality-gives you an advantage of scale. \nFor example, you can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. When\nTV advertising first arrived-when talking color pictures first came into our\nliving rooms-it was an unbelievably powerful thing. And in the early days,\nwe had three networks that had whatever it was-say ninety percent of the\naudience. \n \nAm I going to take something I don't know and put it in my mouth-which is\na pretty personal place, after all-for a lousy dime? \n \nWell, if you were Procter & Gamble, you could afford to use this new\nmethod of advertising. You could afford the very expensive cost of network\ntelevision because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some\nlittle guy couldn't. And there was no way of buying it in part. Therefore, he\ncouldn't use it. In effect, if you didn't have a big volume, you couldn't use\nnetwork TV advertising-which was the most effective technique. \nSo when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a\nhuge tailwind. Indeed, they prospered and prospered and prospered until\nsome of them got fat and foolish, which happens with prosperity-at least to\nsome people. \nAnd your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to\nsome remote place, I may see \nWrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz's chewing gum. Well, I know that\nWrigley is a satisfactory product whereas I don't know anything about\nGlotz's. So if one is forty cents and the other is thirty cents, am I going to\n\f\ntake something I don't know and put it in my mouth which is a pretty\npersonal place, after all-for a lousy \ndime? \n \nSo, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well knowledge, has advantage\nof \nscale-what we might call an informational advantage. \nAnother advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use\nthe term \"social proof.\" We are all influenced-subconsciously and, to some\nextent, consciously- we see others do and approve. Therefore , if\neverybody's buying something, we think it's better. We don't like to be the\none guy who's out \nof step. \nAgain, some of this is at a subconscious, level, and some of it isn't.\nSometimes,  consciously and rationally think, \"God, I didn't know' much\nabout this. 'they know more than I do. 'Therefore, why shouldn't I follow\nthem\" \n \nThe social proof phenomenon which comes right out of psychology\ngives huge advantage to scale for example with very wide\ndistribution which course is hard to get one advantage of Coca-Cola\nis that it's available almost everywhere in the world  \n \nwell suppose you have a little soft drink exactly how do you make it\navailable all over the Earth the world wide distribution setup which is\nslowly won by big enterprise games to be a huge advantage and if\n\f\nyou think about it once you get enough advantages of that type it can\nbecome very hard for anybody to dislodge you \n \nThere's another kind of advantage of scale in some businesses the\nvery nature of things is to sort of cascade towards the overwhelming\ndominance of One For The Other obvious when is daily newspaper\nthere is practically no City left in the United States aside from few\nvery big ones where there is more than one daily newspaper  \n \nand again that as a scale think once I get most of the circulation I get\nmost of the advertising and once I get most of the advertising and\ncirculation why would anyone want the thinner paper with less\ninformation in it? So it tends to cascades to a winner take all\nsituation and that is a separate form of advantages of scale\nphenomenon \n \nSimilarly, all these huge advantages of scale allow greater specialization\nwithin the firm. Therefore, each person can be better at what he does. And\nthese advantages of scale are so great, for example, that when Jack Welch\ncame into General Electric, he just said, \"The hell with it. We're either\ngoing to be #l or #2 in every field we're in or we're going to be out. I don't\ncare how many people I have to fire and what I have to sell. We're going to\nbe #1 or #2 or out.\" \n \nThe Saturday Evening Post and all those things are gone, What we have\nnow is Motocross-which is\n\f\nread by a bunch of nuts who like to participate in tournaments where they\nturn somersaults on their motorcycles, \n \nThat was a very tough-minded thing to do, but I think it was a very correct\ndecision if you're thinking about maximizing shareholder wealth. And I\ndon't think it's a bad thing to do for a civilization either, because I think that\nGeneral Electric is stronger for having Jack Welch there. And there are also\ndisadvantages of scale. For example, we-by which I mean Berkshire\nHathaway-are the largest shareholder in Capital Cities/ABC. And have had\ntrade publications there that got murdered-where our competitors beat us.\nAnd the way they beat us was by going to a narrower specialization. We'd\nhave a travel magazine for business travel. So somebody would create one\nwhich was addressed solely at corporate travel departments. Like an\necosystem, you're getting a narrower and narrower specialization. \n \n194 \n \nWhen they got much more efficient they could tell more to the guys\nwho ran corporate travel departments + they did not have to waste\nthe ink and paper mailing out stuff that corporate travel departments\nare not interested in reading it was a more efficient system and they\nbe our brains out as we relied on our production \n \nThat is what happened to the Saturday evening post and all those\nthings they are gone but we have now is Motocross which is read by\na bunch of nuts would like to participate and tournaments where they"

And in a\nBureaucracy you think the work is done when it goes out of your in\nbasket to somebody else’s in basket but of course it isn't. It's not done\nuntil AT&T delivers what it's supposed to deliver. \nbig, fat, dumb, unmotivated bureaucracies. \nThey also tend to become somewhat corrupt. In other words, if I've got a\ndepartment and you've got a department and we kind of share power\n\f\nrunning this thing, there's sort of an unwritten rule: \"If you won't bother me,\nI won't bother you, and we're both happy.\" So you get layers of\nmanagement and associated costs that nobody needs. Then, while people\nare justifying all these lawyers, it takes forever to get anything done.\nThey're too slow to make decisions, and nimbler people run circles around\nthem. \n \nTelevision was dominated by one network CBS-in its early days. \n \nThe constant curse of scale is that it leads to big, dumb bureaucracy which,\nof course, reaches its highest and worst form in government where the\nincentives are really awful. That doesn't mean we don't need government-\nbecause we do. But it's a terrible problem to get big bureaucracies to\nbehave. \nSo people go to stratagems. They create little decentralized units and fancy\nmotivation and training programs. For example, for a big company, General\nElectric has fought bureaucracy with amazing skill. But that's because they\nhave a combination of a genius and a fanatic running it. And they put him\nin young enough so he gets a long run. Of course, that's Jack Welch. \n \nBut bureaucracy is terrible.... And as things get very powerful and very big,\nyou can get some really dysfunctional behavior. Look at Westinghouse.\nThey blew billions of dollars on a bunch of dumb loans to real estate\ndevelopers. They put some guy who'd come up by some career path-I don't\nknow exactly what it was, but it could have been refrigerators or something-\nand all of a sudden, he's loaning money to real estate developers building\n\f\nhotels. It's a very unequal contest. And, in due time, they lost all those\nbillions of dollars. CBS provides an interesting example of another rule of\npsychology-namely, Pavlovian association. If people tell you what you\nreally don't want to hear-what's unpleasant-there is an almost automatic\nreaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it. It isn't\nforedestined that you have to be this way. But you will tend to be this way if\nyou don't think about it. \n \nTelevision was dominated by one network-CBS-in its early days. And Paley\nwas a god. But he didn't like to hear what he didn't like to hear, and people\nsoon learned that. So they told Paley only what he liked to hear. Therefore,\nhe was soon living in a little cocoon of unreality and everything else was\ncorrupt although it was a great business. \n \nSo the idiocy that crept into the system was carried along by this huge tide.\nIt was a Mad Hatter's Tea Party the last ten years under Bill Paley. \n \nAnd that is not the only example, by any means. You can get severe\nmisfunction in the high ranks of business. And, of course, if you're\ninvesting,it can make a hell of a lot of difference. If you take all the\nacquisitions that CBS made under Paley after the acquisition of the network\nitself, with all his dumb advisors-his investment bankers, management\nconsultants, and so forth, who were getting paid very handsomely-it was\nabsolutely terrible.\n\f\nSo life is an everlasting battle between those two forces to get these\nadvantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot like the U.S.\nAgriculture Department on the other side-where they just sit around and so\nforth. I don't know exactly what they do. However, I do know that they do\nvery little useful work. \nOn the subject of advantages of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite\ninteresting. Just think about it. The concept of a chain store was a\nfascinating invention. You get this huge purchasing power-which means\nthat you have lower merchandise costs. You get a whole bunch of little\nlaboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get\nspecialization. \n \nIf one little guy is trying to buy across twenty-seven different merchandise\ncategories influenced by traveling salesmen, he's going to make a lot of\ndumb decisions. But if your buying is done in headquarters for a huge\nbunch of stores,you can get very bright people that know a lot about\nrefrigerators and so forth to do the buying. \n \nThe reverse is demonstrated by the little store where one guy is doing all\nthe buying. It's like the old story about the little store with salt all over its\nwalls. And a stranger comes in and says to the store owner, 'You must sell a\nlot of salt.\" And he replies, \"No, I don't. But you should see the guy who\nsells me salt.\" \nSo there are huge purchasing advantages. And then there are the slick\nsystems of forcing everyone to do what works. So a chain store can be a\nfantastic enterprise\n\f\nHow does a guy in Bentonville, Arkansas, with no money, blow right by\nSears, Roebuck? And he does it in his own lifetime-in fact, during his own\nlate lifetime because he was already pretty old by the time he started out\nwith one little store.... \n \nIt's quite interesting to think about Wal-Mart starting from a single store in\nArkansas-against Sears, Roebuck with its name, reputation and all of its\nbillions. How does a guy in Bentonville, Arkansas, with no money, blow\nright by Sears, Roebuck? And he does it in his own lifetime-in fact, during\nhis own late lifetime because he was already pretty old by the time he\nstarted out with one little store.... \nHe played the chain store game harder and better than anyone else. Walton\ninvented practically nothing. But he copied everything anybody else ever\ndid that was smart, and he did it with more fanaticism and better employee\nmanipulation. So he just blew right by them all. \n \n198 \n \nHe also had a very interesting competitive strategy in the early days. He\nwas like a prize-fighter who wanted a great record so he could be in the\nfinals and make a big TV hit. So what did he do? He went out and fought\nforty-two palookas. Right? And the result was knockout, knockout,\nknockout forty-two times. Walton, being as shrewd as he was, basically\nbroke other small town merchants in the early days. With his more efficient\nsystem, he might not have been able to tackle some titan head-on at the\n\f\ntime. But with his better system, he could sure as hell destroy those small\ntown merchants. And he went around doing it time after time after time.\nThen, as he got bigger, he started destroying the big boys. \n \nWell, that was a very, very shrewd strategy. \n \nYou can say, \"Is this a nice way to behave\" Well, capitalism is a pretty\nbrutal place. But I personally think that the world is better for having Wal-\nMart. I mean, you can idealize small town life. But I've spent a fair amount\nof time in small towns. And let me tell you-you shouldn't get too idealistic\nabout all those businesses he destroyed. \nPlus, a lot of people who work at Walmart are very high-grade, bouncy\npeople who are raising nice children. I have no feeling that an inferior\nculture destroyed a superior culture. I think that is nothing more than\nnostalgia and delusion. But, at any rate, it's an interesting model of how the\nscale of things and fanaticism combine to be very powerful. And it's also an\ninteresting model on the other side-how with all its great advantages, the\ndisadvantages of bureaucracy did such terrible damage to Sears, \n \nRoebuck. Sears had layers and layers of people it didn't need. It was very\nbureaucratic. It was slow, to think. And there was an established way of\nthinking. If you poked your head up with a new thought, the system kind of\nturned against you. It was everything in the way of a dysfunctional big\nbureaucracy that you would expect. In all fairness, there was also much that\nwas good about it. But it just wasn't'[ as lean and mean and shrewd and\neffective as Sam Walton. And, in due time, all Sears' advantages of scale"

    "raw_text": "were not enough to prevent it from losing heavily to Wal-Mart and other\nsimilar retailers. \n \nThe net Amount of money that's been made by the shareholders of airlines\nsince Kitty Hawk is now a negative figure. \n \nHere’s a model that we've had trouble with. Maybe you'll be able to figure\nbetter. Many markets get down to two or three big competitors or five or\nsix. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. \nBut in others, everybody does very well. \nOver the years, we've tried to figure out why the competition in some\nmarkets gets sort of rational from the investor's point of view so that the\nshareholders do well, while in other markets there's destructive \ncompetition that destroys shareholder wealth. \nIf it's a pure commodity like airline seats, you can understand why no one\nmakes any money. As we sit here, jUst think of what airlines have given to\nthe world-safe travel, greater experience. time with your loved ones, you\nname it. Yet, the net amount of money that's been made by the shareholders\nof airlines since Kitty Hawk is now a negative figure-a substantial negative\nfigure. Competition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by\nderegulation, it ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business. \n \nYet, in other fields-like cereals, for example-almost all the big boys make\nout. If you're some kind of a medium-grade cereal maker, you might make\nfifteen percent on your capital. And if you're really good, you might make\nfifty percent. But why are cereals so profitable-despite the fact that it looks\n\f\nto me like they're competing like crazy with promotions, coupons, and\neverything else? I don't fully understand it. \nObviously, there's a brand identity factor in cereals that doesn't exist in\nairlines. That must be the main factor that accounts for it. \nAnd maybe the cereal makers, by and large, have learned to be less crazy\nabout fighting for market share-because if you get even one person who's\nhell-bent on gaining market share.... For example, if I were Kellogg and I\ndecided that I had to have sixty percent of the market, I think I could take\nmost of the profit out of cereals. I'd ruin Kellogg in the process. But I think\nI could do it. \nIn some businesses, the participants behave like a demented Kellogg. In\nother businesses, they don't. Unfortunately, I do not have a perfect model\nfor predicting how that's going to happen. \n \n201 \n \nFor example, if you look around at bottler markers, you'll find many\nmarkets \nwhere bottlers of Pepsi and Coke both make a lot of money and many\nothers where they destroy most of the profitability of the two franchises.\nThat must get down to the peculiarities of individual adjustment to market\ncapitalism. I think you'd have to know the people involved to fully\nunderstand what was happening. \n \nIn microeconomics, of course, you've got the concept of patents,\ntrademarks, exclusive franchises, and so forth. Patents are quite interesting.\n\f\nWhen I was young, I think more money went into patents than came out.\nJudges tended to throw them out-based on arguments about what was really\ninvented and what relied on prior art. That isn't altogether clear. \nBut they changed that. They didn't change the laws. They just changed the\nadministration-so that it all goes to one patent court. And that court is now\nvery much more pro-patent. So I think people are now starting to make a lot\nof money out of owning patents. \n \nTrademarks, of course, have always made people a lot of money. A\ntrademark system is a wonderful thing for a big operation if it's well known.\nThe exclusive franchise can also be wonderful. If there were only three\ntelevision channels awarded in a big city and you owned one of them, there\nwere only so many hours a day that you could be on. So you had a natural\nposition in an oligopoly in the pre-cable days. And if you get the franchise\nfor the only food stand in an airport, you have a captive clientele, and you\nhave a small monopoly of a sort. The great lesson in microeconomics is to\ndiscriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it's\ngoing to kill you. And most people do not get this straight in their heads.\nBut a fellow like Buffett does. \n \nFor example, when we were in the textile business, which is a terrible\ncommodity business, we were making low-end textiles-which are a real\ncommodity product. And one day, the people came to Warren and said,\n\"They've invented a new loom that we think will do twice as much work as\nour old ones.\" And Warren said, \"Gee, I hope this doesn't work-because if it\ndoes, I'm going to close the mill.\" And he meant it.\n\f\nThe great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when\ntechnology is going to help you and when it's going to kill you \n \nWhat was he thinking He was thinking, \"[it's a lousy business. We're\nwarning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the\nelderly workers. But we're not going to put huge amounts of new capital\ninto a lousy  business.\" \nAnd he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a\nbetter machine introduced into the production of a commodity product\nwould all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going\nto stick to our ribs as owners. \n \nThey don't do the second step of the analysis-which is to determine how\nmuch is going to stay home and how much is just going to flow through to\nthe customer \n \nThat's such an obvious concept-that there are all kinds of wonderful new\ninventions that give you nothing as owners except the opportunity to spend\na lot more money in a business that's still going to be lousy. The money still\nwon't come to you. All of the advantages from great improvements are\ngoing to flow through to the customers. \n \nConversely, if you own the only newspaper in Oshkosh and they were to\ninvent more efficient ways of composing the whole newspaper, then when\n\f\nyou got rid of the old technology and got new fancy computers and so forth,\nall of the savings would come right through to the bottom line. \nIn all cases, the people who sell the machinery-and, by and large, even the\ninternal bureaucrats urging you to buy the equipment-show you projections\nwith the amount you'll save at current prices with the new technology.\nHowever, they don't do the second step of the analysis-which is to\ndetermine how much is going to stay home and how much is just going to\nflow through to the customer. I've never seen a single projection\nincorporating that second step in my life. And I see them all the time.\nRather, they always read: \"This capital outlay will save you so much money\nthat it will pay for itself in three years.\" \nSo you keep buying things that will pay for themselves in three years. And\nafter twenty years of doing it, somehow you've earned a return of only\nabout four percent per annum. That's the textile business. \n \nAnd it isn't that the machines weren't better. It's just that the savings didn't\ngo to you. The cost reductions came through all right. But the benefit of the\ncost reductions didn't go to the guy who bought the equipment. It's such a\nsimple idea. \n \nIt's so basic. And yet it's so often forgotten. \n \nThen there's another model from microeconomics that I find very\ninteresting. When technology moves as fast as it does in a civilization like\nours, you get a phenomenon chat I call competitive destruction. You know,\nyou have the finest buggy whip factory, and, all of a sudden, in comes this\n\f\nlittle horseless carriage. And before too many years go by, your buggy whip\nbusiness is dead. You either get into a different business or -you're\ndestroyed. It happens again and again and again. \n \nAnd when these new businesses come in, there are huge advantages for the\nearly birds. And when you're an early bird, there's a model that I call\n\"surfing\"-when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there,\nhe can go a long, long time' But if he gets off the wave, he becomes mired\nin shallows. \nBut people get long runs when they're right on the edge of the wave,\nwhether it's Microsoft or Intel or all kinds of people , including National\nCash Register in the early days. \n \nThe cash register was one of the great contributions to civilization. It's a\nwonderful story. \nPatterson was a small retail merchant who didn't make any money. One day,\nsomebody sold him a crude cash register, which he put into his retail\noperation. And it instantly changed from losing money to earning a profit\nbecause it made it so much harder for the employees to steal. But Patterson,\nhaving the kind of mind that he did, didn't think, \"Oh, good for my retail\nbusiness.\" He thought, \"I'm going into the cash register business.\" And, of\ncourse, he created National Cash Register. And he \"surfed.\" He got the best\ndistribution system, the biggest collection of patents, and the best of\neverything. He was a fanatic about everything important as the technology\ndeveloped. I have in my files an early National Cash Register Company\nreport in which Patterson described his methods and objectives. And a well-\n\f\neducated orangutan could see that buying into partnership with Patterson in\nthose early days, given his notions about the cash register business, was a\ntotal one hundred percent cinch. And, of course, that's exactly what an\ninvestor should be looking for. In a long life, you can expect to profit\nheavily from at least a few of those opportunities if you develop the wisdom\nand will to seize them. At any rate, \"surfing\" is a very powerful model. \n \nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway, by and large, does not invest in these people\nthat are \"surfing\" on complicated technology. After all, we're cranky and\nidiosyncratic as you may have noticed. \n \nAnd Warren and I don't feel like we have any great advantage in the high-\ntech sector. In fact, we feel like we're at a big disadvantage in trying to\nunderstand the nature of technical developments in software, computer\nchips, or what have you. So we tend to avoid that stuff, based on our\npersonal inadequacies. Again, that is a very, very powerful idea. Every\nperson is going to have a circle of competence. And it's going to be very\nhard to enlarge that circle. If I had to make my living as a musician.... I can't\neven think of a level low enough to describe where I would be sorted out to\nif music were the measuring standard of the civilization. So you have to\nfigure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other\npeople have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. And that's as\nclose to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out\nwhere you've got an edge. And you've got to play within your own circle of\ncompetence."

    "raw_text": "dessert, I'll turn to stock picking trying to draw on this general worldly\nwisdom as we go. \n \nYou have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games\nwhere other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. \n \nI don't want to get into emerging markets, bond arbitrage, and so forth. I'm\ntalking about nothing but plain vanilla stock picking. That, believe me, is\ncomplicated enough. And I'm talking about common stock picking. \nThe first question is, \"What is the nature of the stock market?\" And that\ngets you directly to this efficient market theory that got to be the rage-a total\nrage-long after I graduated from law school. \n \nAnd it's rather interesting because one of the greatest economists of the\nworld is a substantial shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway and has been from\nthe very early days after Buffett was in control. His textbook always taught\nthat the stock market was perfectly efficient and that nobody could beat it.\nBut his own money went into Berkshire and made him wealthy. So, like\nPascal in his famous wager, he hedged his bet. \n \nThe iron rule of life is that only twenty percent of the people can be in the\ntop fifth \n \nIs the stock market so efficient that people can't beat it? Well, the efficient\nmarket theory is obviously roughly right-meaning that markets are quite\nefficient and it's quite hard for anybody to beat the market by significant\n\f\nmargins as a stock picker by just being intelligent and working in a\ndisciplined way. \n \nIndeed, the average result has to be the average result. By definition,\neverybody can't beat the market. As I always say, the iron rule of life is that\nonly twenty percent of the people can be in the top fifth. That's just the way\nit is. So the answer is that it's partly efficient and partly inefficient. \n \nAnd, by the way, I have a name for people who went to the extreme\nefficient market theory-which is \"bonkers.\" It was an intellectually\nconsistent theory that enabled them to do pretty mathematics. So I\nunderstand its seductiveness to people with large mathematical gifts. It just\nhad a difficulty in that the fundamental assumption did not tie properly to\nreality. \nAgain, to the man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If you're\ngood at manipulating higher mathematics in a consistent way,, why not\nmake an assumption that enables you to use your Tool? \n \nThe model I like-to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market\nfor common stocks-is the pari-mutuel system at the race track. If you stop\nto think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. \n \nEverybody goes there and bets, and the odds change based on what's bet.\nThat's what happens in the stock market. Any damn fool can see that a\nhorse carrying a lightweight with a wonderful win rare and a good post\nposition. etc.. etc.. is way more likely to win than a horse with a terrible\n\f\nrecord and extra weight and so on and so on. But if you look at the damn\nodds, the bad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the good horse pays 3 to 2.\nThen, it's not clear which is statistically the best bet using the mathematics\nof Fermat and Pascal. The prices have changed in such a way that it's very\nhard to beat the system. \n \nAnd then the track is taking seventeen percent off the top. So not only do\nyou have to outwit all the other bettors, but you've got to outwit them by\nsuch a big margin that on average, you can afford to take seventeen percent\nof your gross bets off the top and give it to the house before the rest of your\nmoney can be put to work. \n \nGiven those mathematics, is it possible to beat the horses using only one's\nintelligence? Intelligence should give some edge because lots of people\nwho don't know anything go out and bet lucky numbers and so forth.\nTherefore, somebody who really thinks about nothing but horse\nperformance and is shrewd and mathematical could have a very\nconsiderable edge, in the absence of the frictional cost caused by the house\ntake. \n \nUnfortunately, what a shrewd horseplayer's edge does in most cases is to\nreduce \nhis average loss over a season of betting from the seventeen percent that he\nwould lose if he got the average result to maybe ten percent. However, there\nare actually a few people who can beat the game after paying the full\nseventeen percent.\n\f\nI used to play poker, when I was young, with a guy who made a substantial\nliving doing nothing but bet harness races. Now, harness racing is a\nrelatively inefficient market. You don't have the depth of intelligence\nbetting on harness races that you do on regular races. What my poker pal\nwould do was to think about harness races \nas his main profession. And he would bet only occasionally when he saw\nsome mispriced bet available. And by doing that, after paying the full\nhandle to the house-which I presume was around seventeen percent-he\nmade a substantial living. \n \nIf you stop to think \nabout it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets,\nand the odds change based on what's bet. That's what happens in the stock\nmarket. \n \nYou have to say that's rare. However, the market was not perfectly efficient.\nAnd if it weren't for that big seventeen percent handle, lots of people would\nregularly be beating lots of other people at the horse races. It's efficient, yes.\nBut it's not perfectly efficient. And with enough shrewdness and fanaticism,\nsome people will get better results than others. The stock market is the same\nway-except that the house handle is so much lower. If you take transaction\ncosts the spread between the bid and the ask plus the commissions-and if\nyou don't trade too actively, you're talking about fairly low transaction\ncosts. So that, with enough fanaticism and enough discipline, some of the\nshrewd people are going to get way better results than average in the nature\nof things.\n\f\nThe one thing all those winning bettors in the whole history of people\nwho’ve beaten the parimutuel system have is quite simple: they bet very\nseldom. \n \nIt is not a bit easy. And, of course, fifty percent will end up in the bottom\nhalf, and seventy percent will end up in the bottom seventy percent. But\nsome people will have an advantage. And in a fairly low transaction cost\noperation, they will get better than average results in stock picking.  \n \nHow do you get to be one of those who is a winner-in a relative sense-\ninstead of a loser? \n \nHere again, look at the pari-mutuel system. I had dinner last night by\nabsolute accident with the president of Santa Anita. He says that there are\ntwo or three bettors who have a credit arrangement with the track, now that\nthey have off-track betting, who are actually beating the house. The track is\nsending money out net after the full handle-a lot of it to Las Vegas, by the\nway-to people who are actually winning slightly, net, after paying the full\nhandle. They're that shrewd about something with as much unpredictability\nas horse racing. \n \nIt's not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know\neverything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings\nwho work hard at it-who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet-that\nthey can occasionally find one . And the wise ones bet heavily when the\n\f\nworld offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds.\nAnd the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple. \n \nThe way to win is to work, work, work, work, and hope to have a few\ninsights. \n \nThat is a very simple concept. And to me it's obviously right-based on\nexperience not only from the pari-mutuel system, but everywhere else. And\nyet, in investment management, practically nobody operates that way. We\noperate that way-I'm talking about Buffett and Munger. And we're not alone\nin the world. But a huge majority of people have some other crazy construct\nin their heads. \nAnd instead of waiting for a near cinch and loading up, they apparently\nascribe to the theory that if they work a little harder or hire more business\nschool students, they'll come to know everything about everything all the\ntime. To me, that's totally insane. \nHow many insights do you need? Well, I'd argue that you don't need many\nin a lifetime. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway and all of its accumulated\nbillions, the top ten insights account for most of it. And that's with a very\nbrilliant man warren’s a lot more able than I am and very disciplined-\ndevoting his lifetime to it. I don't mean to say that he's only had ten insights.\nI'm just saying that most of the money \ncame from ten insights. \nSo you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a\nwinning pari-mutuel player. Just think of it as a heavy odds against game\nfull of bullshit and craziness with an occasional mispriced something or\n\f\nother. And you're probably not going to be smart enough to find thousands\nin a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It's just that\nsimple. \n \nWhen Warren lectures at business schools, he says, \"I could improve your\nultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only twenty slots in it\nso that you had twenty punches-representing all the investments that you\ngot to make in a lifetime. And once you'd punched through the card, you\ncouldn't make any more investments at all.\" He says, \"Under those rules,\nyou'd really think carefully about what you did, and you'd be forced to load\nup on what you'd really thought about. So you'd do so much better.\" \n \nAgain, this is a concept that seems perfectly obvious to me. And to Warren,\nit seems perfectly obvious. But this is one of the very few bUsiness classes\nin the United States where and body will be saying so. It just isn't the\nconventional wisdom. 'To me, it's obvious that the winner has to be very\nselective'. It's been obvious to me since very early in life. I don't know why\nit's not obvious to very many other people. I think the reason why we sot\ninto such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that\nI tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle. I asked him, \"my God, they're\npurple and green. Do fish really take these lures?\" And he said, \"Mister, I\ndon't sell to fish.\" \n \nInvestment managers are in the position of that fishing tackle salesman.\nThey're like the guy who was selling salt to the guy who already had too\n\f\nmuch salt. And as long as the guy will buy salt, why, they'll sell salt. But\nthat isn't what ordinarily works for the buyer of investment advice. \n \nIf you invested Berkshire Hathaway-style, it would be hard to get paid as an\ninvestment manager as well as they're currently paid-because you'd be\nholding a block of Wal-Mart and a block of Coca-Cola and a block of\nsomething else. You'd be sitting on your ass. And the client would be\ngetting rich. And, after a while, the client would think, \"Why am I paying\nthis guy half-a-percent a year on my wonderful \npassive holdings?\" \n \nSo what makes sense for the investor is different from what makes sense for\nthe manager. And, as usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior\nare incentives for the decision maker. \n \nAs usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for\nthe decision maker., and \"getting the incentives right\" is a very very\nimportant lesson. \n \nFrom all business, my favorite case on incentives is Federal Express. The\nheart and soul of its system-which creates the integrity of the product-is\nhaving all its airplanes come to one place in the middle of the night and\nshift all the packages from plane to plane. If there are delays, the whole\noperation can't deliver a product full of integrity to Federal Express\ncustomers.\n\f\nAnd it was always screwed up. They could never get it done on time. they\ntried everything-moral suasion, threats, you name it. And nothing worked. \nFinally, somebody got the idea to pay all these people not so much an hour,\nbut so much a shift-and when it's all done, they can all go home. Well, their\nproblems cleared up overnight. \n \nSo getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson. It was not\nobvious to Federal Express what the solution was. But maybe now, it will\nhereafter more often be obvious to you. \nAll right, we've now recognized that the market is efficient as a pari-mutuel\nsystem is efficient-with the favorite more likely than the long shot to do\nwell in racing, but not necessarily give any betting advantage to those that\nbet on the favorite. \n \nIn the stock market, some railroad that's beset by better competitors and\ntough unions may be available at one-third of its book value. In contrast,\nIBM in its heyday might be selling at six times book value. So it's just like\nthe pari-mutuel system. Any damn fool could plainly see that IBM had\nbetter business prospects than the railroad. But once you put the price into\nthe formula, it wasn't so clear anymore what was going to work best for a\nbuyer choosing between the stocks. So it's a lot like a pari-mutuel system.\nAnd, therefore, it gets very hard to beat. \n \nWhat style should the investor use as a picker of common stocks in order to\ntry to beat the market-in other words, to get an above average long-term\nresult? A standard technique that appeals to a lot of people is called \"sector\n\f\nrotation.\" You simply figure out when oils are going to outperform retailers,\netc., etc., etc. You just kind of flit around being in the hot sector of the\nmarket making better choices than other people. And presumably, over a\nlong period of time, you get ahead. \n \nHowever, I know of no really rich sector rotator. Maybe some people can do\nit I'm not saying they can't. All I know is that all the people I know who got\nrich-and I know a lot of them-did not do it that way. \nThe second basic approach is the one that Ben Graham used, admired by\nWarren and me. As one factor, Graham had this concept of value to a\nprivate owner-what the whole enterprise would sell for if it were available.\nAnd that was calculable in many cases. Then, if you could take the stock\nprice and multiply it by the number of shares and get something that was\none-third or less of sellout value, he would say that you've got a lot of edge\ngoing for you. Even with an elderly alcoholic running a stodgy business,\nthis significant excess of real value per share working for you means that all\nkinds of good things can happen to you. You had a huge margin of safety-as\nhe put it-by having this big excess value going for you. \n \nBut he was, by and large, operating when the world was in shell-shock from\nthe 1930s-which was the worst contraction in the English-speaking world in\nabout 600 years. When in Liverpool, I believe, got down to something like\na 600-year low, adjusted for inflation. People were so shell-shocked for a\nlong time thereafter that Ben Graham could run his Geiger counter over this\ndetritus from the collapse of the 1930s and find things selling below their\nworking capital per share and so on. And in those days, working capital\n\f\nactually belonged to the shareholders. If the employees were no longer\nuseful, you just sacked them all, took the working capital, and stuck it in the\nowners' pockets. That was the way capitalism then worked. \n \nNowadays, of course, the accounting is not realistic-because the minute the\nbusiness starts contracting, significant assets are not there. Under social\nnorms and the new legal rules of the civilization, so much is owed to the\nemployees, that the minute the enterprise goes into reverse, some of the\nassets on the balance sheet aren't there anymore. \n \nNow, that might not be true if you run a little auto dealership yourself. You\nmay be able to run it in a way that there's no health plan and this and that so\nthat if the business gets lousy, you can take your working capital and go\nhome. But IBM can't or at least didn't. Just look at what disappeared from\nits balance sheet when it decided that it had to change size both because the\nworld had changed technologically and because its marker position had\ndeteriorated. \n \nAnd in terms of blowing it, IBM is some example. Those were brilliant,\ndisciplined people. But there was enough turmoil in technological change\nthat IBM got bounced off the wave after \"surfing\" successfully for sixty\nyears. And that was some collapse-an object lesson in the difficulties of\ntechnology and one of the reasons why Buffett and Munger don't like\ntechnology very much. We don't think we're any good at it, and strange\nthings can happen."

His father opened an importing business that\nquickly failed. Despite the challenges of poverty, Graham attended and\ngraduated from Columbia University. He took a job as a chalker on Wall\nStreet with Newburger, Henderson, and Loeb. His intelligence and\ncapability were soon apparent, and by age twenty five, he was a partner at\nthe firm. The 1929 market crash almost wiped out Graham, but he learned\nvaluable lessons about investing. In the 1930s, Graham published a series of\nbooks on investing that became classics. Among these impressive titles are\nSecurity Analysis and. The Intelligent Investor. Graham introduced the\nconcept of \"intrinsic value\" and the wisdom of buying stocks at a discount\nto that value. \n \nAt any rate, the trouble with what I call the classic Ben Graham concept is\nthat gradually the world wised up, and those real obvious bargains\ndisappeared. You could run your Geiger counter over the rubble , and it\nwouldn't click. \n \nBut such is the nature of people who have a hammer-to whom, as I\nmentioned, every problem looks like a nail-that the Ben Graham followers\nresponded by changing the calibration on their Geiger counters. In effect,\nthey started defining a bargain in a different way. And they kept changing\nthe definition so that they could keep doing what they'd always done. And it\n\f\nstill worked pretty well. So the Ben Graham intellectual system was a very\ngood one. \n \nOf course, the best part of it all was his concept of \"Mr. Market.\" Instead of\nthinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it as a manic-depressive\nwho comes by every day. And some days \"Mr. Market\" says, \"I'll sell you\nsome of my interest for way less than you think it's worth.\" And other days,\nhe comes by and says, \"I'll buy your interest at a price that's way higher\nthan you think it's worth.\" And you get the option of deciding whether you\nwant to buy more, sell part of what \nyou already have, or do nothing at all. \n \nTo Graham, it was a blessing to be in business with a manic-depressive who\ngave you this series of options all the time. That was a very significant\nmental construct. And it's been very useful to Buffett, for instance, over his\nwhole adult lifetime. \n \nHowever, if we'd stayed with classic Graham the way Ben Graham did it,\nwe would never have had the record we have. And that's because Graham\nwasn't trying to do what we did. \n \nPerhaps the Soviets had this German proverb in mind when they selected\nthe hammer for their revolutionary symbol: \"One must either be the\nhammer... or the anvil.\"\n\f\nFor example, Graham didn't want to ever talk to management. And his\nreason was that, like the best sort of professor aiming his teaching at a mass\naudience, he was trying to invent a system that anybody could use. And he\ndidn't feel that the man in the street could run around and talk to\nmanagement and learn things. He also had a concept that management\nwould often couch the information very shrewdly to mislead. Therefore, it\nwas very difficult. And that is still true, of course-human nature being what\nit is. \n \nAnd so having started out as Grahamires-which, by the way, worked fine-\nwe gradually got what I would call better insights. And we realized that\nsome company that was selling at two or three times book value could still\nbe a hell of a bargain because of momentums implicit in its position,\nsometimes combined with an unusual managerial skill plainly present in\nsome individual or other, or some system or other. \n \nAnd once we'd gotten over the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a\nbargain based on quantitative measures that would have horrified Graham,\nwe started thinking about better businesses. \n \nAnd, by the way, the bulk of the billions in Berkshire Hathaway has come\nfrom the better businesses. Much of the first $200 or $300 million came\nfrom scrambling around with our Geiger counter. But the great bulk of the\nmoney has come from the great businesses.\n\f\nMost investment managers are in a game where the clients expect them to\nknow a lot about a lot of things. We didn't have any clients who could fire\nus at Berkshire Hathaway \n \nAnd even some of the early money was made by being temporarily present\nin great businesses. Buffett Partnership, for example, owned American\nExpress and Disney when they got pounded down. \n[Most investment managers are] in a game where the clients expect them to\nknow a lot about a lot of things. We didn't have any clients who could fire\nus at Berkshire Hathaway. So we didn't have to be governed by any such\nconstruct. And we came to this notion of finding a mispriced bet and\nloading up when we were very confident that we were right. So we 're way\nless diversified. And I think our system \nis miles better. \nHowever, in all fairness, I don't think [a lot of money managers] could\nsuccessfully sell their services if they used our system. But if you're\ninvesting for forty years in some pension fund, what difference does it make\nif the path from start to finish is a little more bumpy or a little different than\neverybody else's so long as it's all going to work out well in the end? So\nwhat if there's a little extra volatility. \n \nIn investment management today, everybody wants not only to win, but to\nhave the path never diverge very much from a standard path except on the\nupside. Well, that is a very artificial, crazy construct. That's the equivalent\nin investment management to the custom of binding the feet of the Chinese\nwomen. It's the equivalent of what Nietzsche meant when he criticized the\n\f\nman who had a lame leg and was proud of it. That is really hobbling\nyourself. Now, investment managers would say, \"We have to be that way.\nThat's how we're measured.\" And they may be right in terms of the way the\nbusiness is now constructed. But from the viewpoint of a rational consumer,\nthe whole system's \"bonkers\" and draws a lot of talented people into\nsocially useless activity. \n \nYou're much more likely to do well if you start out to do something feasible\ninstead of something that \nisn't feasible. Isn't that perfectly obvious? \n \nAnd the Berkshire system is not \"bonkers.\" It's so damned elementary that\neven bright people are going to have limited, really valuable insights in a\nvery competitive world when they're fighting against other very bright,\nhardworking people. And it makes sense to load up on the very few good\ninsights you have instead of pretending to know everything about\neverything at all times. You're much more likely to do well if you start out\nto do something feasible instead of something that isn't feasible. Isn't that\nperfectly obvious? \n \nHow many of you have fifty-six brilliant insights in which you have equal\nconfidence? Raise your hands, please. How many of you have two or three\ninsights that you have some confidence in? I rest my case. \n \nI'd say that Berkshire Hathaway's system is adapting to the nature of the\ninvestment problem as it really is.\n\f\nWe've really made the money out of high-quality businesses. In some cases,\nwe bought the whole business. And in some cases, we just bought a big\nblock of stock. \nBut when you analyze what happened, the big money's been made in the\nhigh quality businesses. And most of the other people who've made a lot of\nmoney have done so in high-quality businesses. \n \nOver the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the\nbusiness which underlies it earns. If the business earns six percent on\ncapital over forty years and you hold it for that forty years, you're not going\nto make much different than a six percent return-even if you originally buy\nit at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns eighteen percent on\ncapital over twenty or thirty years, even if you pay an expensive looking\nprice, you'll end up with one hell of a result. \n \nSo the trick is getting into better businesses. And that involves all of these\nadvantages of scale that you could consider momentum effects. \n \nHow do you get into these great companies? One method is what I'd call the\nmethod of finding them small-get em when they're little. For example, buy\nWalMart when Sam Walton first goes public and so forth. And a lot of\npeople try to do just that. And it's a very beguiling idea. If I were a young\nman, I might actually go into it.\n\f\nBut it doesn't work for Berkshire Hathaway anymore because we've €lot too\nmuch money. We can't find anything that fits our size parameter that way.\nBesides, we're set in our ways. But I regard finding them small as a\nperfectly intelligent approach for somebody to try with discipline. It's just\nnot something that I've done. \n \nFinding 'em big obviously is very hard because of the competition. So far,\nBerkshire's managed to do it. But can we continue to do it? What's the next\nCoca Cola investment for us? Well, the answer to that is I don't know. I\nthink it gets harder for us all the time. And ideally-and we've done a lot of\nthis-you get into a great business which also has a great manager because\nmanagement matters. For example, it's made a hell of a difference to\nGeneral Electric that Jack Welch came in instead of the guy who took over\nWestinghouse-one hell of a difference. So management matters, too. \n \nAnd some of it is predictable. I do not think it takes a genius to understand\nthat Jack Welch was a more insightful person and a better manager than his\npeers in other companies. Nor do I think it took tremendous genius to\nunderstand that Disney had basic momentums in place that are very\npowerful and that Eisner and Wells were very unusual managers. \n \nSo you do get an occasional opportunity to get into a wonderful business\nthat's being run by a wonderful manager. And, of course, that's hog heaven\nday. If you don't load up when you get those opportunities, it's a big\nmistake.\n\f\nOccasionally, you'll find a human being who's so talented that he can do\nthings that ordinary skilled mortals can't. I would argue that Simon Marks-\nwho was second generation in Marks & Spencer of England was such a\nman. Patterson was such a man at National Cash Register. \nAnd Sam Walton was such a man. \n \nThese people do come along-and, in many cases, they're not all that hard to\nidentify. If they've got a reasonable hand-with the fanaticism and\nintelligence and so on that these people generally bring to the party-then\nmanagement can matter much. \nHowever, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than\nbetting on the quality of management. In other words, if you have to choose\none, bet on the business momentum, not the brilliance of the manager. \n \nBut, very rarely, you find a manager who's so good that you're wise to\nfollow him into what looks like a mediocre business. Another very simple\neffect I very seldom see discussed either by investment managers or\nanybody else is the effect of taxes. If you're going to buy something that\ncompounds for thirty years at fifteen percent per annum and you pay one\nthirty-five percent tax at the very end, the way that works out is that after\ntaxes, you keep 13.3 percent per annum. \n \n222 \n \nTrying to minimize taxes too much is one of the great standard causes of\nreally dumb mistakes."

    "raw_text": "In contrast, if you bought the same investment but had to pay taxes every\nyear of thirty-five percent out of the fifteen percent that you earned, then\nyour return would be fifteen percent minus thirty-five percent of fifteen\npercent-or only 9.75 percent per year compounded. So the difference there\nis over 3.5 percent. And what 3.5 percent does to the numbers over long\nholding periods like thirty years is truly eye-opening. If you sit on your ass\nfor long, long stretches in great companies, you can get a huge edge from\nnothing but the way income taxes work. \n \nEven with a ten percent per annum investment, paying a thirty-five percent\ntax at the end gives you 8.3 percent after taxes as an annual compounded\nresult after thirty years. In contrast, if you pay the thirty-five percent each\nyear instead of at the end, your annual result goes down to 6.5 percent. So\nyou add nearly two percent of after-tax return per annum if you only\nachieve an average return by historical standards from common stock\ninvestments in companies with low dividend payout ratios. \n \nBut in terms of business mistakes that I've seen over a long lifetime, I\nwould say that trying to minimize taxes too much is one of the great\nstandard causes of really dumb mistakes. I see terrible mistakes from people\nbeing overly motivated by tax considerations. \n \nWarren and I personally don't drill oil wells. We pay our taxes. And we've\ndone pretty well, so far. Anytime somebody offers you a tax shelter from\nhere on in life, my advice would be don't buy it.\n\f\nIn fact, anytime anybody offers you anything with a big commission and a\n200 page prospectus, don't buy it. Occasionally, you'll be wrong if you\nadopt \"Munger's Rule.\" However, over a lifetime, -you'll be a long way\nahead-and you will miss a lot of unhappy experiences that might otherwise\nreduce your love for your fellow man. \n \nThere are huge advantages for an individual to get into a position where you\nmake a few great investments and just sit on your ass: You're paying less to\nbrokers. You're listening to less nonsense. And if it works, the governmental\ntax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per\nannum compounded. \n \nAnd you think that most of you are going to get that much advantage by\nhiring investment counselors and paying them one percent to run around,\nincurring a lot of taxes on your behalf? Lots of luck. \n \n\"-We Pay Our Taxes\" \n \n\"Berkshire's Christmas present for Uncle Sam: On my right, Berkshire 2004\nFederal tax return- l0,249 pages and three billion plus total tax. In my left\nhand, the tax return I filed at age 13 showing a total tax of $7.\" \n-Buffett \n \n\"Warren and I personally don't drill oil wells. 'We pay our taxes. And we've\ndone pretty well, so far. Anytime somebody offers you a tax shelter from\n\f\nhere on in life, my advice would be don't buy it.\" \n_Munger \n \nAre there any dangers in this philosophy? Yes. Everything in life has\ndangers. Since it's so obvious that investing in great companies works, it\ngets horribly overdone from time to time. In the Nifty-Fifty days,\neverybody could tell which companies were the great ones. So they got up\nto fifty, sixty, and seventy times earnings. And just as IBM fell off the\nwave, other companies did, too. Thus, a large investment disaster resulted\nfrom too high prices. And you've got to be aware of that danger. \n \nSo there are risks. Nothing is automatic and easy. But if you can find some\nfairly priced great company and buy it and sir, that tends to work out very,\nvery well indeed-especially for an individual. \n \nWithin the growth stock model, there's a sub-position: There are actually\nbusinesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime where any manager\ncould raise the return enormously just by raising prices-and here they\nhaven't done it. So they have huge untapped pricing power that they're not\nusing. That is the ultimate no-brainer. \n \nThat existed in Disney. It's such a unique experience to take your grandchild\nto Disneyland. You're not doing it that often. And there are lots of people in\nthe country. And Disney found that it could raise those prices a lot, and the\nattendance stayed right up.\n\f\nSo a lot of the great record of Eisner and Wells was utter brilliance but the\nrest came from just raising prices at Disneyland and Disneyworld and\nthrough video cassette sales of classic animated movies. \n \nAt Berkshire Hathaway, Warren and I raised the prices of See's Candy a\nlittle faster than others might have. And, of course, we invested in Coca-\nCola-which had some untapped pricing power. And it also had brilliant\nmanagement. So a Goizueta and Keough could do much more than raise\nprices. It was perfect. \n \nYou will get a few opportunities to profit from finding underpricing. There\nare actually people out[ there who don't price everything as high as the\nmarket will easily stand. And once you figure that out, it's like finding\nmoney in the street-if you have the courage of your convictions. \n \n225 \n \nIf you look at Berkshire's investments where a lot of the money's been made\nand you look for the models, you can see that we twice bought into two-\nnewspaper towns \nwhich have since become one-newspaper towns. So we made a bet to some\nextent. \n \nWe faced a situation where we had both the top hand in a game that was\nclearly going to end up with one winner and a management with a lot of\nintegrity and intelligence, It was a dream\n\f\nan absolute, damn dream, \n \nIn one of those-the washington Post-we bought it at about twenty percent of\nthe value to a private owner. So we bought it on a Ben Graham-style basis-\nat one-fifth of obvious value-and, in addition, we faced a situation where\nyou had both the top hand in a game that was clearly going to end up with\none winner and management with a lot of integrity and intelligence. That\none was a real dream. They're very high class people-the Katharine Graham\nfamily. That's why it was a dream-an absolute. damn dream. \nOf course, that came about back in '73-'74. And that was almost like 1932.\nThat was probably a once-in-forty-years-type denouement in the markets.\nThat investment's up about fifty times over our cost. If I were you, I\nwouldn't count on getting any investment in your lifetime quite as good as\nthe Washington Post was in '73 and'74. \nLet me mention another model. Of course, Gillette and Coke make fairly\nlow-priced items and have a tremendous marketing advantage all over the\nworld. And in Gillette's case, they keep \"surfing\" along new \ntechnology, which is fairly simple by the standards of microchips. But it's\nhard for competitors to do. \n \nSo they've been able to stay constantly near the edge of improvements in\nshaving. There are whole countries where Gillette has more than ninety\npercent of the shaving market. GEICO is a very interesting model. It's\nanother one of the one hundred or so models you ought to have in your\nhead. I've had many friends in the sick-business fix game over a long\n\f\nlifetime. And they practically all use the following formula-I call it the\ncancer surgery formula: \nThey look at this mess. And they figure out if there's anything sound left\nthat can live on its own if they cut away everything else. And if they find\nanything sound, they just cut away everything else. Of course, if that doesn't\nwork, they liquidate the business. But it frequently does work. \n \nAnd GEICO had a perfectly magnificent business- in a mess, but still\nworking. Misled by success, GEICO had done some foolish things. They\ngot to thinking that, because they were making a lot of money, they knew\neverything. And they suffered huge losses. \n \nAll they had to do was to cut out all the folly and go back to the perfectly\nwonderful business that was lying there. And when you think about it, that's\na very simple model. And it's repeated over and over again. \n \nAnd, in GEICO's case, think about all the money we passively made. It was\na wonderful business combined with a bunch of foolishness that could\neasily be cut out. And people were coming in who were temperamentally\nand intellectually designed so they were going to cut it our. That is a model\nyou want to look for. And you may find one or two or three in a long\nlifetime that are very good. And you may find twenty or thirty that are good\nenough to be quite useful. \n \nFinally, I'd like to once again talk about investment management. That is a\nfunny business-because on a net basis, the whole investment management\n\f\nbusiness together gives no value added to all buyers combined. That's the\nway it has to work. \n \nOn a net basis, the whole investment management business together gives\nno value added to all buyers combined. That's the way it has to work. \n \nOf course, that isn't true of plumbing, and it isn't true of medicine. If you're\ngoing to make your careers in the investment management business, you\nface a very peculiar situation. And most investment managers handle it with\npsychological denial-just like a chiropractor. That is the standard method of\nhandling the limitations of the investment management process. But if you\nwant to live the best sort of life, I would urge each of you not to use the\npsychological denial mode. \n \nI think a select few-a small percentage of the investment managers-can\ndeliver value added. But I don't think brilliance alone is enough to do it. I\nthink that you have to have a little of this discipline of calling your shots\nand loading up if you want to maximize your chances of becoming one who\nprovides above average real returns for clients over the long pull. \nBut I'm just talking about investment managers engaged in common stock\npicking. I am agnostic elsewhere. I think there may well be people who are\nso shrewd about currencies and this, that, and the other thing that they can\nachieve good long-term records operating on a pretty big scale in that way.\nBut that doesn't happen to be my milieu. I'm talking about stock picking in\nAmerican stocks.\n\f\nI think it's hard to provide a lot of value added to the investment\nmanagement client, but it's not impossible. \n \nA letter from USC finance professor Guilford Babcock (shown below and\nleft) sharing with Charlie one of his student reactions to the talk, \"'Worldly\n'Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Business.\" \n \nI thought the interview with munger was brilliant. It totally grabbed my\nattention when he challenged us to make only 20 investments in a lifetime.\nIt changes your perception of an investment when what is at stake becomes\nmore. We marriage and less we date. Perhaps with that article in mind I will\ndive a little more deeper to make sure my investments are good ones. \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Three \n \nWe continue with this question occasioned by countless questions over the\nyears at cocktail parties, etc. \nQuestion: \"All kinds of people ask me for some foolproof system for\nachieving financial security or saving for their retirement. I try to dodge\nthose questions.\" [Editor: \"But this time, Charlie, we're not going to let you\ndodge it\"] \nAnswer: \"Spend less than you make; always be saving something. Put it\ninto a tax-deferred account. Over time, it will begin to amount to\nsomething. THIS IS SUCH A NO-BRAINER.\" \n \nTalk Two Revisited"

    "raw_text": "As I reviewed Talk Two in 2006, I thought it would be improved by adding \n(1) an attempt to explain the extreme investment success of Harvard and \nYale in recent years, plus \n(2) a prediction about outcomes for the many pools of capital that will now\ntry to duplicate the past success of Harvard and Yale by copying or\ncontinuing their methods, plus (3) a brief comment about implications for\nthe efficient market hypothesis as demonstrated in a 2005 book, Fortune's\nFormula, \nby William Poundstone \n \nTo me, it seems likely that, as Harvard and Yale de-emphasized\nconventional unleveraged holding of diversified U.S. common stocks, their\ninvestment success was boosted by factors including the four described\nbelow: \n \n(1) By investing in LBO funds, Harvard and Yale, introduced leverage into\ntheir results from owning interests in U.S. businesses. And the LBO fund\nstructure gave them a way to make their leveraged business investments in\na manner safer than is possible in a normal margin account, prone during\npanics co forced sales. Decent comparative results often followed in\nmarkets with tolerable general outcomes. And this happened even when\nnet-after-cost results from investments in the LBO funds were no better\nthan would have occurred through only slightly leveraged investment in an\nindex of U.S. stocks.\n\f\n(2) In category after category, Harvard and Yale selected or directly\nemployed investment managers who were way above average in ability,\nproviding additional evidence that investment markets are not perfectly\nefficient and that some good investment results come from abnormal skill\nor other abnormal advantage. As one example, Harvard and Yale, by reason\nof their own prestige, were able to get into some of the most profitable\nhigh-tech venture-capital funds, not available to all other investors. These\nfunds, using momentum provided by their own past success, had an\nopportunity advantage over less well established venture capital operations,\nin that the best entrepreneurs, quite logically, made early presentations to\nthe best-regarded funds. \n \n(3) Harvard and Yale wisely and opportunistically imitated investment\nbanking firms by going into several activities that were then non-traditional,\nlike investing in distressed U.S. corporate bonds and high-coupon foreign\nbonds and leveraged \"fixed income arbitrage,\" during a period when many\ngood opportunities were available to skilled operators in the activities\nchosen. \n \n(4) Finally, the benefits that came to Harvard and Yale in recent years\nthrough leverage and unconventionality were often, of course, given a large\ntailwind by a happy combination of declining interest rates and rising price-\nearnings ratios for stocks \n \n232\n\f\nThe extreme investment success of Harvard and Yale gives me both\npleasure and pain. My pleasure comes from this demonstration that\nacademic skill is often useful in worldly affairs. People like me who were\nattracted by academia, yet have gone into business, naturally respond to\nsuch worldly achievement much like the many modern scientists who relish\nthe example of Thales of Miletus. This scientist of antiquity made a large\nprofit by leasing most of the olive presses in his area just before the\noccurrence of a particularly bountiful harvest. \n \nMy pain comes from  \n(1) foreseeing a lot of future adversity for other worthy institutions, driven\nby envy and salesmen into enthusiastic imitation of Harvard and Yale and  \n(2) disapproval of the conduct of many of the salesmen likely to succeed in\npushing the imitation. Something similar to what I fear happened near the\nend of the high-tech bubble. At that time envy of successful early-stage,\nhightech venture-capital investors like Stanford, plus dubious sales methods\nof many venture capitalists, caused about $90 billion to rush into low-\nquality, imitative early stage ventures that by now may have created as\nmuch as $45 billion in net losses for late-coming investors. \n \nMoreover, Harvard and Yale may now need new displays of unconventional\nwisdom that are different from their last displays. It is quire counter-\nintuitive to decrease that part of one's activity that has recently worked best.\nBut this is often a good idea. And so also with reducing one's perception of\none's needs, instead of increasing risks in an attempt to satisfy perceived\nneeds\n\f\n. \nTalk two was made in 1994, about twelve years before this addendum was\nwritten. And during that twelve years much useful thought and data\ncollection has supported the idea that neither securities markets nor pari-\nmutuel betting systems at race tracks prevent some venturers from gaining\nhighly satisfactory, way-above average results through unusual skill.\nWilliam Poundstone's book, Fortune's Formula, collects much of the\nmodern evidence on this point in a highly entertaining way. Moreover, the\nbook contains an account of the lollapalooza investment record of Claude\nShannon, pioneer scientist in information theory, that makes Shannon's\nmethods look much like those of Charlie Munger \n \nWorldly Wisdom updated: O and A with Charlie \n \nHow do you and Warren evaluate an acquisition candidate?. \n \n\"We're light on financial yardsticks; we apply lots of subjective criteria: Can\nwe trust management? Can it harm our reputation? What can go wrong? Do\nwe understand the business? Does it require capital infusions to keep it\ngoing? What is the expected cash flow? We don't expect linear growth;\ncyclicality is fine with us as long as the price is appropriate.\" \n \nWhat should a young person look for in a career-? \n \n\"I have three basic rules. Meeting all three is nearly impossible, but you\nshould try anyway:"

Business School. . .. You were assigned a transcript of my\nU.S.C. talk. And there's nothing I said then that I wouldn't repeat today. But\nI want to amplify what I said then. \n \n[It's] perfectly clear ... that if Warren Buffett had never learned anything\nnew after graduating from the Columbia Business School, Berkshire would\nbe a pale shadow of its present self. Warren would have gotten rich-because\nwhat he learned from Ben Graham at Columbia was enough to make\n\f\nanybody rich. But he wouldn't have the kind of enterprise Berkshire\nHathaway is if he hadn't kept learning. \n \nHow do you get worldly wisdom? What system do you use to rise into the\ntiny top percentage of the world in terms of having sort of an elementary\npractical wisdom? \n \nI've long believed that a certain system-which almost any intelligent person\ncan learn works way better than the systems that most people use. As I said\nat the U.S.C. Business School, what your need is a latticework of mental\nmodels in your head. And you hang your actual experience and your\nvicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this\nlatticework of powerful models. And, with that system, things gradually get\nto fit together in a way that enhances cognition. \n \nCharlie discusses several of the specific mental models elaborated in other\ntalks. \n \nYour assigned reading for today included the latest annual letters from Jack\nWelch and Warren Buffett relating to General Electric and Berkshire\nHathaway, respectively. Jack Welch has a Ph.D. in engineering. And Warren\nplainly could have gotten a Ph.D. in any field he wanted to pursue. And\nboth gentlemen are inveterate teachers. \n \nWorldly wisdom is cluite academic when you get right down to it. Look at\nwharf General Electric has achieved-and, for that matter, what Berkshire"

    "raw_text": "Hathaway has achieved. \n \nOf course, Warren had a professor/mentor-Ben Graham-for whom he had a\ngreat affection. Graham was so academic that when he graduated from\nColumbia, three different academic departments invited him into their Ph.D.\nprograms and asked him to start teaching immediately as part of the Ph.D.\nprogram: [those three departments being] literature, Greek and Latin\nclassics, and mathematics. \n \nGraham had a very academic personality. I knew him. He was a lot like\nAdam Smith-very preoccupied, very brilliant. He even looked like an\nacademic. And he was a good one. And Graham, without ever really trying\nto maximize the gaining of wealth, died rich-even though he was always\ngenerous and spent thirty years teaching at Columbia and authored or\ncoauthored the best textbooks in his field. \n \nSo I would argue that academia has a lot to teach about worldly wisdom and\nthat the best academic values really work. \n \nOf course, when I urge a multidisciplinary approach-that you've got to have\nthe main models from a broad array of disciplines and you've got to use\nthem all-I'm really asking you to ignore jurisdictional boundaries \n \nAnd the world isn't organized that way. It discourages the jumping of\njurisdictional boundaries. Big bureaucratic businesses discourage it. And, of\n\f\ncourse, academia itself discourages it. All I can say there is that, in that\nrespect, academia is horribly wrong and dysfunctional. \n \nAnd some of the worst dysfunctions in businesses come from the fact that\nthey balkanize reality into little individual departments with territoriality\nand turf protection and so forth. So if you want to be a good thinker, you\nmust develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries.  \n \nYou don't have to know it all. Just cake in the best big ideas from all these\ndisciplines. And it's not that hard to do. \n \nI might try and demonstrate that point by [using the analogy of the card\ngame of contract bridge. \nSuppose you want to be good at declarer play in contract bridge. Well, you\nknow the contract-you know what you have to achieve. And you can count\nup the sure winners you have by laying down your high cards and your\ninvincible trumps. \n \nBut if you're a trick or two short, how are you going co get the other needed\ntricks? Well, there are only six or so different, standard methods. You've got\nlong suit establishment. You've got finesses. You've got throw-in plays.\nYou've got crossruffs. You've got squeezes. And you've got various ways of\nmisleading the defense into making errors. So it's a very limited number of\nmodels.  \nBut if you only know one or two of those models, then you're going to be a\nhorse's patoot in declarer play.\n\f\nFurthermore, these things interact. Therefore, you have to know how the\nmodels interact. Otherwise, you can't play the hand right. \n \nSimilarly, I've told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers\nin bridge think, \"How can I take the necessary winners?\" But they think it\nthrough backwards, [too. They also think,] \"What could possibly go wrong\nthat could cause me to have too many losers? And both methods of thinking\nare useful. So [to win in] the game of life, get the needed models into your\nhead and think it through forward and backward. What works in bridge will\nwork in life. \n \nThat contract bridge is so out of vogue in your generation is a tragedy.\nChina is way smarter than we are about bridge. They're teaching bridge in\ngrade school now. And God knows the Chinese do well enough when\nintroduced to capitalist civilization. If we compete with a bunch of people\nchat really know how to play bridge when our people don't, it'll be just one\nmore disadvantage we don't need. \n \nSince your academic structure, by and large, doesn't encourage minds\njumping jurisdictional boundaries, you're at a disadvantage because, in that\none sense, even though academia's very useful to you, you've been\nmistaught.  \n \nMy solution for you is one that I got at a very early age from the nursery:\nthe story of the Little Red Hen. The punch line, of course, is, \"'Then I'll do\n\f\nit myself,' said the Little Red Hen.\" \n \n\"'Then I'll do it myself,' said the Little Red Hen,\" \n \nSo if your professors won't give you an appropriate multidisciplinary\napproach if each wants to overuse his own models and underuse the\nimportant models in other disciplines-you can correct that folly yourself.\nJust because he's a horse's patoot, you don't have to be one, too. You can\nreach out and grasp the model that better solves the overall problem. All\nyou have to do is know it and develop the right \nmental habits. \n \nAnd it's kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter\nthan you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and\nmultidisciplinary....  \n \nFurthermore, there's a lot of money in it-as I can testify from my own\npersonal experience. \n \n[Charlie begins the Coca-Cola business case retailed in Talk Four,\n\"Practical Thought About Practical Thought” and discusses the importance\nof flavor] \n \nOne of my favorite business stories comes from Hershey. They get their\nflavor because they make their cocoa butter in old stone grinders that they\nstarted with in the 1800s in Pennsylvania. And a little bit of the husk of the"

Therefore, they get that odd flavor\nthat people like in Hershey's chocolate. \n \nHershey, knew enough when they wanted to expand into Canada to know\nthey shouldn't change their winning flavor. \n \nHershey, knew enough when they wanted to expand into Canada to know\nthey shouldn't change their winning flavor. Therefore, they copied their\nstone grinders. Well, it took them five years to duplicate their own flavor.\nAs you can see, flavors can be quite tricky. \n \n240 \n \nEven today, there's a company called International Flavors and Fragrances.\nIt's the only company I know that does something on which you can't get a\ncopyright or a patent, but which nevertheless receives a permanent royalty.\nThey manage to do that by helping companies develop flavors and aromas\nin their trademarked products-like shaving cream. The slight aroma of\nshaving cream is very important to consumption. So all of this stuff is\nterribly important. \n \ncontinuing the Coca-Cola case study, Charlie explains how our\nunderstanding of graphic \nreplications of mathematical ideas are rooted in biology.\n\f\nMy friend, Dr. Nat Myhrvold, who's the chief technology officer at\nMicrosoft, is bothered by this. He's a Ph.D. physicist and knows a lot of\nmath. And it disturbs him that biology could create a neural apparatus that\ncould do automatic differential equations at fast speed-and, yet, everywhere\nhe looks, people are total klutzes at dealing with ordinary probabilities and\nordinary numbers. \n \nBy the way, I think Myhrvold's wrong to be amazed by that. The so-called\nfitness landscape of our ancestors forced them to know how to throw\nspears, run around, turn corners, and what have you long before they had to\nthink correctly like Myhrvold. So I don't think he should be so surprised.\nHowever, the difference is so extreme that I can understand how he finds it\nincongruous. \n \nMankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we Are so intrinsically\nlousy at manipulating numbers. It's called the graph. \n \nAt any rate, mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so\nintrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It's called the graph. Oddly\nenough, it came out of the Middle Ages. And it's the only intellectual\ninvention of the monks during the Middle Ages I know of that's worth a\ndamn. The graph puts numbers in a form that looks like motion. So it's\nusing some of this primitive neural stuff in your system in a way that helps\nyou understand it. So the Value Line graphs are very useful.\n\f\nThe graph I've distributed is on log paper-which is based on the natural\ntable of logarithms. And that's based on the elementary mathematics of\ncompound interest-which is one of the most important models there is on\nearth. So there's a reason why that graph is in that form. And if you draw a\nstraight line through data points on a graph on log paper, it will tell you the\nrate at which compound interest is working for you. So these graphs are\nmarvelously useful....  \nI don't use Value Line's predictions because our system works better for us\nthan theirs-in fact, a lot better. But I can't imagine not having their graphs\nand their data. It's a marvelous, marvelous product. . .. \n \nCharlie discusses the importance of trademarks to Coca-Cola's success and\ncarries it o'er to a discussion of food products and Carnation. \n \nCarnation Company \nIn 1899, grocer E. A. Stuart founded the Pacific Coast Condensed Milk\nCompany in the state of 'Washington based on the relatively new process of\nevaporation. Using a local tobacconist's store name, Carnation, he had a\nbrand for his new milk product. Through attention to processes and clever\nmarketing. Carnation became associated with its \"Contented Cows\" and\nhigh-quality milk products. In 1985, the company was acquired by Nestle. \n \nNow when Carnation tried to make a deal for its trademark, there was this\none guy who sold Carnation Fish. So help me God, that was his trade name.\nDon't ask me why. And every time they'd say, \"We'll pay you $250,000,\"\nhe'd say, \"I want $400,000.\" And, then, four years later, they'd say, \"We'll\n\f\ngive you $1 million,\" and he'd say, \"I want $2 million.\" And they just kept\ndoing that all the way through. And they never did buy the trademark-at\nleast, they hadn't bought it the last time I looked. \n \nIn the end, Carnation came to him sheep facedly and said, \"We'd like to put\nour quality control inspectors into your fish plants to make sure that your\nfish are perfect; and we'll pay all the costs\"-which he quickly and smirkily\nallowed. So he got free quality control in his fish plants-courtesy of the\nCarnation Company. \n \nThis history shows the enormous incentive you create if you give a guy a\ntrademark [he can protect]. And this incentive is very useful to the wider\ncivilization. As you see, Carnation got so that it was protecting products\nthat it didn't even own. \n \nThat sort of outcome is very, very desirable [for society]. So there are some\nvery fundamental macroeconomic reasons why even communist countries\nshould protect trademarks. They don't all do it, but there are very powerful\nreasons why they should. And, by and large, averaged out around the world,\ntrademark protection been pretty good. \n \n[Charlie applies various mental models to Coca-Cola.] \n \nHowever, if you don't have the basic models and the basic mental methods\nfor dealing with the models, then all you can do is to sit there twiddling\nyour thumbs as you look at the Value Line graph. But you don't have to\n\f\ntwiddle your thumbs. You've got to learn one hundred models and a few\nmental tricks and keep doing it all of your life. It's not that hard \n \nAnd the beauty of it is that most people won't do it-partly because they've\nbeen miseducated. And I'm here trying to help you avoid some of the perils\nthat might otherwise result from that miseducation. \n \nOK. We've been through some of the general ideas in the search for worldly\nwisdom. And now I want to turn to something even more extreme and\npeculiar than the talk I've already given you. Of all the models that people\nought to have in useful form and don't, perhaps the most important lie in the\narea of psychology.... \n \nI recently had an instructive experience: I just returned from Hong Kong. I\nhave a pal there who's a headmaster of one of the leading schools. He gave\nme this book called The Language Instinct, written by Steven Pinker. Well,\nPinker is a semanticist professor who rose in the shadow of Noam\nChomsky-Linguistics Institute Professor at M.I.T.-who is probably the\ngreatest semanticist who ever lived. \n \nSteven Pinker (b. 1954) \nBorn in Montreal. Steven Pinker earned a degree in experimental\npsychology at McGill University and then moved on to Harvard for his\ndoctorate. He has taught at Harvard and MIT at various times and is\ncurrently the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology\nat Harvard. Pinker is interested in language and the mind, including the"

    "raw_text": "field of visual cognition. That field encompasses the ability to imagine\nshapes and recognize faces and objects. He specializes in language\ndevelopment in children and has written many important papers and books\non this and other topics. \n \nAnd Pinker says that human language ability is not just learned-it's deeply\nburied, to a considerable extent, in the genome. It's not in the genome of the\nother animals, including the chimpanzee, to any really useful extent. It's a\ngift that came to humans. And Pinker proves his point pretty well. \n \nOf course, Chomsky's already proven it. You have to be pretty ignorant not\nto realize that a good deal of language ability is right there in the human\ngenome. And even though you have to work like hell to improve it through\neducation, you start with a big leg up in your genes. \n \nPinker can't understand why Chomsky-who, again, is such a genius-takes\nthe position that the jury's still \nout about why this ability is in the human genome. Pinker, in effect, says:\n\"Like hell, the jury is still out! The language instinct got into humans in\nexactly the same way that everything else got there-through Darwinian\nnatural selection.\" \n \n“ The language instinct got into humans in exactly the same way that\neverything else got there-through Darwinian natural selection.\"\n\f\nWell, the junior professor is clearly right-and Chomsky's hesitation is a little\ndaft. \n \nBut if the junior professor and I are right, how has a genius like Chomsky\nmade an obvious misjudgment? The answer's quite clear to me-Chomsky is\npassionately ideological. He is an extreme egalitarian leftist who happens to\nbe a genius. And he's so smart that he realized that if he concedes this\nparticular Darwinian point, the implications threaten his leftist ideology. So\nhe naturally has his conclusion affected by his ideological bias. \n \nAnd that gets into another lesson in worldly wisdom: If ideology can screw\nup the head of Chomsky, imagine what it does to people like you and me. \n \nHeavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition.\nLook at these Islamic fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of\nGreek tourists shouting, \"God's work!\" Ideology does some strange things\nand distorts cognition terribly.  \n \nIf you get a lot of heavy ideology young-and then you start expressing it-\nyou are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you\nare going to distort your general cognition. \n \nThere's a very interesting history if you take Warren Buffett as an example\nof worldly wisdom: Warren adored his father-who was a wonderful man.\nBut Warren's father was a very heavy ideologue (right wing, it happened to\n\f\nbe), who hung around with other very heavy ideologues (right wing,\nnaturally). \n \nWarren observed this as a kid. And he decided that ideology was dangerous\nand that he was going to stay a long way away from it. And he has\nthroughout his whole life. That has enormously helped the accuracy of his\ncognition. \n \nI learned the same lesson in a different way. My father hated ideology.\nTherefore, all I had to do was imitate my father and, thereby, stay on what I\nregard as the right path. People like Dornan on the right or Nader on the left\nhave obviously gone a little daft. They're extreme examples of what\nideology will do to you particularly violently expressed ideology. Since it\npounds ideas in better than it convinces out, it's a very dangerous thing to\ndo. \n \nIf you get a lot of heavy ideology young-and then you start expressing it-\nyou are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern \n \nTherefore, in a system of multiple models across multiple disciplines, I\nshould add as an extra rule that you should be very wary of heavy ideology. \n \nYou can have heavy ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and\nobjectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes you absolutely sure that the\nminimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn't-and it's kind of a holy\nconstruct where you know you're right-makes you a bit nuts."

    "raw_text": "This is a very complicated system. And life is one damn relatedness after\nanother. It's all right to think that, on balance, you suspect that civilization is\nbetter if it lowers the minimum wage or raises it. Either position is OK. But\nbeing totally sure on issues like that with a strong, violent ideology, in my\nopinion, turns you into a lousy thinker. So beware of ideology-based mental\nmisfunctions. \n \n[Charlie laments how poorly the field of psychology deals with incentive-\ncaused bias.] \n \nAnother reason that I mentioned Pinker, the semanticist who wrote the book\nthat I told you about earlier, is that at the end of his book, he says (roughly),\n\"I've read the psychology textbooks. And they're daft.\" He says, \"This\nwhole subject is misorganized and mistaught.\" \n \nWell, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I've\nnever taken a single course in psychology. However, I've come to exactly\nthe same conclusion-that the psychology texts, while \nthey are wonderful in part, are also significantly daft. \n \nIn fact, just take simple psychological denial. About three centuries before\nthe birth of Christ, Demosthenes said, \"What a man wishes, that also will he\nbelieve.\" Well, Demosthenes was right.\n\f\nI had a family acquaintance whose much-loved son-who was brilliant and a\nstar football player-flew off over the ocean and never came back. well, his\nmother thought he was still alive. The mind will sometimes flip so that the\nwish becomes the belief. It will do so at various levels. Individuals vary in\nhow, much psychological denial they get. But miscognition from denial\noverwhelmingly pervades the reality that you're going to have to deal with.\nAnd yet, you won't find an adequate treatment of simple psychological\ndenial in psychology texts. \n \n246 \n \nMichael Faraday (179r-1567) \nFamous for his investigations of physics, chemistry and electricity Michael\nFaraday's wisdom includes: \n\"Nothing is too wonderful to be true.\" \n\"Work Finish. Publish.\" (his advice to the young WilLiam Crookes. later a\nfamous chemist and physicist in his own right) \nThe five essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration,\ndiscrimination,, organization, innovation, and communication,\" \n\"Why, sir  there is every possibility that you will soon be able to tax it!\" (to\nPrime Minister William Gladstone, on the usefulness of electricity) \n \nSo you cannot learn psychology the way you are professor speech\nat you have got to learn everything they teach but you have got to\nlearn a lot more that they don't teach because they don't handle their\nown subject correctly\n\f\nPsychology to me, as currently organised, is electromagnetism after\nFaraday but before Maxwell a lot has been discovered, but no one\nmind has put it all together and proper form and it should be done\nbecause it would not be that hard to do and it is enormously\nimportant \n \nJust open a psychology text turn to the index, look up envy well envy\nmade it into one or two or three of the Ten Commandments Moses\nnew all about and we the old jews when they were herding sheep's\nnew all about envy it is just that psychology professor is don't know\nabout envy. \n \nBooks that thick teaching a psychology course without envy?! And\nwith no simple psychological denial?! And no incentive caused\nbias?! \n \nAnd psychological tests don't deal adequately with combinations of\nfactors I told you earlier to be aware of the lollapalooza effect when\ntwo or three or more forces are operating in the same direction \n \nWell, the single most publicized psychology experiment ever done is the\nMilgram experiment- where they asked people to apply what they had every\nreason to believe was heavy electrical torture on innocent fellow human\nbeings. And they manipulated most of these decent volunteers into doing\nthe torture.\n\f\nSo you can learn psychology the way! your professors teach it. You’ve got\nto learn everything they teach. But you’ve got to learn a lot more that they\ndon’t teach-because they don't handle their own subject correctly. \n \nMilgram performed the experiment right after Hitler had gotten a bunch of\nbelieving Lutherans, Catholics, and so forth to perform unholy acts they\nshould have known were wrong. He was trying to find out how much\nauthority could be used to manipulate high grade people into doing things\nthat were clearly and grossly wrong. \n \nAnd he got a very dramatic effect. He managed to get high-grade people to\ndo many awful things. But for years, it was in the psychology books as a\ndemonstration of authority-how authority could be used to persuade people\nto do awful things. \n \nStanley Milgram Experiments on Authority \n \nStanley Milgram, born in 1933 in New York, grew up during \\world War II\nwhen Nazi atrocities became well known to the world. He earned a political\nscience degree from Queens College and went on to Harvard for a PhD. in\nsocial relations. He took a faculty position at Yale, where he conducted a\nclassic experiment that pitted the subject's moral beliefs against the\ndemands of authority."

    "raw_text": "His experiment found that sixty five percent of his subjects, ordinary\nresidents of New Haven, were willing to give apparently harmful electric\nshocks to a pitifully protesting victim, simply because a scientific authority\ncommanded them to, despite the fact that the victim did nothing to deserve\npunishment. Milgram's results have been used as partial explanation for the\nGerman atrocities of 'World war II. \n \nOf course, that's mere first-conclusion bias. That's not the complete and\ncorrect explanation. Authority is part of it. However, there were also quite a\nfew other psychological principles, all operating in the same direction, that\nachieved that lollapalooza effect precisely because they acted in\ncombination toward the same end. \n \nPeople have gradually figured that out. And if you read the recent\npsychology texts at a place like Stanford, you'll see that they've now\nmanaged to get it about two-thirds right. However, here's the main\nexperiment in all of psychology. And even at Stanford, they still leave out\nsome of the important causes of Milgram's results. \n \nHow can smart people be so wrong? Well, the answer is that they don't do\nwhat I'm telling you to do-which is to take all the main models from\npsychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex\nsystems. \n \nNo pilot takes off without going through his checklist: A, B, C, D.... And no\nbridge player who needs two extra tricks plays a hand without going down\n\f\nhis checklist and figuring out how to do it. But these psychology professors\nthink they're so smart that they don't need a checklist. But they aren't that\nsmart. Almost nobody is. Or, maybe, nobody is. \n \nIf they used a checklist, they'd realize the Milgram experiment harnesses six\npsychological principles, at least-not three. All they'd have to do is to go\ndown the checklist to see [the ones that they missed. \n \nSimilarly, without this system of getting the main models and using them\ntogether in a multimodular way, you'll screw up time after time after time,\ntoo. \n \nOne reason psychology professors so screw up denial is that it's hard to do\ndemonstrative experiments without conduct forbidden by ethics. To\ndemonstrate how misery creates mental dysfunction in people, think of\nwhat you'd have to do to your fellow human beings. And you'd have to do it\nwithout telling chem about the injury to come. So, clearly, there are ethical\nreasons why it's pracTically impossible to do the experiments necessary to\nbest lay out the ways human misery creates human mental misfunction. \n \nMost professors solve this problem, in effect, by assuming, \"If I can't\ndemonstrate it with my experiments, then it doesn't exist.\" However,\nobviously, that's asinine. If something is very important but can't be\nperfectly and precisely demonstrated because of ethical constraints, you\ncan't just meat it like it doesn't exist. You have to do the best you can with\nit-with such evidence as is available.\n\f\nPavlov himself spent the last ten years of his life torturing dogs. And he\npublished. Thus, we have a vast amount of data about misery-caused mental\nmisfunction in dogs-and its correction. Yet, it's in no introductory\npsychology book that you'll ever see. \n \nI don't know whether they don't like the fact that Pavlov tortured dogs or\nwhether B. F, Skinner, by overclaiming when he lapsed into his literary\nmode, made the drawing of implications from animal behavior into human\nbehavior unpopular. However, for some crazy reason or other, the\npsychology books are grossly inadequate in dealing with misery-caused\nmental misfunction. \n \nYou may say, \"What difference does all this psychological ignorance\nmake?\" Well, if I'm right, you need these models that are blanked out by\nthis ignorance. And, furthermore, you need them in a form whereby, if there\nare twenty constructs, you have all 20 in other words \n \n250 \n \nYou have all 20 in other words you should not be operating with pen\nand you need to use them as a checklist so you have to go back and\nput in your own head but I had called the psychology of misjudgment\nin a form where why you have all the important models and you can\nuse them\n\f\nAnd you specially need them when four or five forces from these\nmodels come together to operate in the same direction in such cases\nyou often get lollapalooza effects which can make you rich or they\ncan kill you so it's essential that you be aware of lollapalooza effects \n \nThere's only one right way to do it you have to get the main doctrines\ntogether and use them as a checklist and to repeat for Emphasis you\nhave to pay special attention to combinational effects that create\nlollapalooza  consequences \n \nCharlie discuss the lack of multidisciplinary teaching and the\nprofessions specially how the field of psychology is Virtually ignored\nin Academy \n \nYou can also learn when you are playing the game of persuasion for\na reputable reason I hope to combine these forces in a way that\nmakes you more effective \n \nLet me give you an example of that of Y psychology of your in\ncaptain cooks day he took these long voyages and the time Scurvy\nwas the grade of long voyage and in Scurvy you are leaving guns\npetrify in your mouth and which the disease gets unpleasant and kills\nyou. \n \nAnd being on a primitive sailing ship with a bunch of dying sailors is\nvery awkward business so everybody was terribly interested in\n\f\nScurvy but they did not know about vitamin C. Well, Captain Cook, being\na smart man with a multiple model kind of approach, noticed that Dutch\nships had less scurvy than English ships on long voyages. So he said, \"What\nare the Dutch doing that's different?\" \nAnd he noticed they had all these barrels of sauerkraut. So he thought, \"I'm\ngoing on these long voyages. And it's very dangerous. Sauerkraut may\nhelp.\" So he laid in all this sauerkraut, which, incidentally, happens to\ncontain a trace of vitamin C. \n \nBut English sailors were a tough, cranky!, and dangerous bunch in that day.\nThey hated \"krauts.\" And they were used to their standard food and booze.\nSo how do you get such English sailors to eat sauerkraut? \n \nWell, Cook didn't want to tell 'em that he was doing it in the hope it would\nprevent scurvy-because they might mutiny and take over the ship if they\nthought that he was taking them on a voyage so long that scurvy was likely. \nSo here's what he did: Officers ate at one place where the men could\nobserve them. And for a long time, he served sauerkraut to the officers, but\nnot to the men. And, then, finally, Captain Cook said, \"Well, the men can\nhave it one day a week.\" \n \nIn due course, he had the whole crew eating sauerkraut. I regard that as a\nvery constructive use of elementary psychology. It may have saved God\nknows how many lives and caused God knows how much achievement.\nHowever, if you don't know the right techniques, you can't use them.\n\f\n[Charlie discusses psychological effects in play in marketing of consumer\nitems, such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble products, Tupperware, etc.] \n \nWorldly wisdom is mostly very, very simple. And what I'm urging on you is\nnot that hard to do if you have the will to plow through and do it. And the\nrewards are awesome-absolutely awesome. \n \nBut maybe you aren't interested in awe some rewards or avoiding a lot of\nmisery or being more able to serve everything you love in life. And, if that's\nyour attitude, then don't pay attention to what I've been trying to tell you-\nbecause you're already on the right track. \n \nIt can't be emphasized too much that issues of morality are deeply entwined\nwith \nworldly wisdom considerations involving psychology. For example, take\nthe issue of stealing. A very significant fraction of the people in the world\nwill steal if (A) it's very easy to do and (B) there's practically no chance of\nbeing caught. \n \nAnd once they start stealing, the consistency principle-which is a big part of\nhuman psychology-will soon combine with operant conditioning to make\nstealing habitual. So if you run a business where it's easy to steal because of\nyour methods, you're working a great moral injury on the people who work\nfor you.\n\f\nIt can't be emphasized too much that issues of morality are deeply entwined\nwith worldly wisdom considerations involving psychology \n \nSerpico (1973) \nSerpico was a popular film directed by Sidney Lumet, based on the book by\njournalist Peter Maas of a \"true story.\" The plot concerns undercover police\nofficer Frank Serpico who does his best arresting criminals of all types, but\nespecially drug dealers, despite working in a corrupt police department.\nSerpico refuses to accept bribes and becomes sufficiently appalled at his\nshady colleagues that he testifies against them, thus placing his life in\njeopardy. Set in the early 1970s, the film makes several references to\n\"hippie\" culture and thus appears somewhat dated to current viewers. Al\nPacino appeared in the title role and earned an Academy Award nomination\nfor his acting. The film was also nominated For a screenwriting Oscar. \n \nAgain, that's obvious. It's very, very important to create human systems that\nare \nhard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your civilization because these big\nincentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will rationalize that\nbad behavior is OK. \n \nThen, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological\nprinciples: incentive-caused bias plus social proof. Not only that, but you\nget Serpico effects: If enough people are profiting in a general social\nclimate of doing wrong, then they'll turn on you and become dangerous\nenemies if your try and blow the whistle.\n\f\nIt's very dangerous to ignore these principles and let slop creep in\npowerful psychological forces are at work for Evil. \n \nWhen the Incentives are 'Wrong: 'What a Pain! \nEmployee fraud in medical disability cases is often an outgrowth of hard-to\ndiagnose complaints such as everpopular \"back pain.\" But disability fraud\nextends as well to scams perpetrated by medical practitioners. including\nphantom treatments, double billing, unnecessary care, and unneeded test.\nCharlie's point is that the system as designed invites cheating and that\nhuman beings are psychologically predisposed to commit fraud when\navailable incentives overwhelm structural checks and balances. As he puts\nit, \"if you want to change behaviors, you have to change motivations.\" \n \nHow does this relate to the law business? When people graduate\nfrom places like Stanford Law School and go into the legislatures of\nour Nation and with the best of motives pass laws that are usually\nused by people to cheat well there could hardly be a worst thing you\ncould do \n \nLet's say you have a desire to do public service as a natural part of\nyour planning you think in rivers and ask what can I do to ruin our\nCivilization that's easy if what you want to do is to ruin your\nCivilization you just go to the legislature and pass laws that create\nsystems where in people can easily cheat it will work perfectly.\n\f\nTake the workers compensation system in California stress is real\nand its measuring can be real so you want to compensate people for\ntheir strengths in the workplace it seems like a noble thing to do \n \nBut the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's\npractically impossible to delete huge cheating and once you reward\ncheating you get group Lions Club doctors group union sexy actress\nparticipating in referral scheme you get the total miasma of\ndisastrous behaviour. And the behaviour makes all the people doing\nit was as they do it so you were trying to help your Civilization but\nwhat you did was create enormous damage, net. \n \nSo it's much better to let some things go and compensated to let life\nbe hard than to create systems that are easy to cheat. \n \nLet me give you an example I have a friend who made an industrial\nproduct at a plant in Texas not far from the border he was in a low\nmargin top business he got massive fraud in the workers\ncompensation system to the point that is premium reached double\ndigit percentages of payroll and it was not that dangerous to produce\nhis product it's not like he was a demolition contractor or something. \n \nSo he pleaded with the union, \"You've got to stop this. There's not enough\nmoney in making this product to cover all of this fraud.\" But, by then,\neveryone's used to it. \"It's extra income. It's extra money. Everybody does\n\f\nit. It can't be that wrong. Eminent lawyers, eminent doctors, eminent\nchiropractors-if there are any such things-are cheating.\" \n \nAnd no one could tell them, \"You can't do it anymore.\" Incidentally, that's\nPavlovian mere association, too. When people get bad news, they hate the\nmessenger. Therefore, it was very hard for the union representative to tell\nall of these people that the easy money was about to stop. That is not the\nway to advance as a union representative. \n \nSo my friend closed his plant and moved the work to Utah among a\ncommunity of believing Mormons. \n \nSo my friend closed his plant and moved the work to Utah among a\ncommunity of believing Mormons. Well, the Mormons aren't into workers'\ncompensation fraud-at least they aren't in my friend's plant. And guess what\nhis workers' compensation expense is today? It's two percent of payroll [-\ndown from double digits.] \n \nThis sort of tragedy is caused by letting the slop run. You must stop slop\nearly. It's very hard to stop slop and moral failure if you let it run for a\nwhile. \n \n[Charlie describes his notion of \"Deprival super-reaction syndrome\" as it\nrelates to gambling and the New Coke debacle of the mid-1980s.J\n\f\nOf course, as I said before, there is one big consideration that needs huge\nand special attention as part of any use of techniques deliberately\nharnessing elementary psychological forces: and that is that once you know\nhow to do it, there are real moral limitations regarding how much you\nshould do it. Not all of what you know how to do should you use to\nmanipulate people.  \n \nAlso, if you're willing to transcend the moral limits and the person you're\ntrying to manipulate realizes what -you're doing because he also\nunderstands the psychology', he'll hate you. There is wonderfully persuasive\nevidence of this effect taken from labor relations in Israel. So not only are\nthere moral objections, but there are also practical objections-big ones in\nsome cases.. \n \n255 \n \nWhat makes investment hard, as I said at U.S.C., is that it's easy to see that\nsome companies have better businesses than others. But the price of the\nstock goes up so high that, all of a sudden, the question of which stock is\nthe best to buy gets quite difficult. \n \nQ: how do you incorporate Psychology in your investment decisions? I\nthink it would be more than just pick and products that will appeal to\neverybody like coke. there are a lot of smart people out there also think just\nthe way that you showed us today. so are you looking for failure in the\nthinking other investors you go about picking  successful companies?\n\f\nWhat makes investment hard, as I said at U.S.C., is that it's easy to see that\nsome companies have better businesses than others. But the price of the\nstock goes up so high that, all of a sudden, the question of which stock is\nthe best to buy gets quite difficult. \n \nWe've never eliminated the difficulty of that problem. And ninety-eight\npercent of the time, our attitude toward the market is ... [that] we're\nagnostics. We don't know. Is GM valued properly vis-a-vis Ford? We don't\nknow. \nWe're always looking for something where we think we have an insight\nwhich gives us a big statistical advantage. And sometimes it comes from\npsychology, but often it comes from something else. And we only find a\nfew-maybe one or two a year. We have no system for having automatic\ngood judgment on all investment decisions that can be made. Ours is a\ntotally different system. \n \nWe just look for no-brainer decisions. As Buffett and I say over and over\nagain, we don't leap seven-foot fences. Instead, we look for one-foot fences\nwith big rewards on the other side. So we've succeeded by making the\nworld easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems. \n \nQ: Based on statistical analysis and insight? \n \nWell, certainly when we do make a decision, we think that we have an\ninsight advantage. And it's true that some of the insight is statistical in"

    "raw_text": "nature. However again, we find only a few of those. \n \nWe just look for no-brainer decisions. As Buffett and I say over and over\nagain, we don'T leap seven-foot fences. \n \nIt doesn't help us merely for favorable odds to exist. They have to be in a\nplace where we can recognize them. So it takes a mispriced opportunity that\nwe're smart enough to recognize. And that combination doesn't occur often.\nBut it doesn't have to. If you wait for the big opportunity and have the\ncourage and vigor to grasp it firmly when it arrives, how many do you\nneed? For example, take the top ten business investments Berkshire\nHathaway's ever made. We would be very rich if we'd never done anything\nelse-in two lifetimes. \n \nSo, once again, we don't have any system for giving you perfect investment\njudgment on all subjects at all times. That would be ridiculous. I'm just\ntrying to give you a method you can use to sift reality to obtain an\noccasional opportunity for rational reaction \n \nIf you take that method into something as competitive as common stock\npicking, \nyou're competing with many brilliant people. So, even with our method, we\nonly get \na few opportunities. Fortunately, that happens to be enough.\n\f\nQ: Have you been successful in creating an atmosphere where people\nbelow,you can do the \nsame things you're talking about doing yourself? For example, you talked\nabout the tendency \ntowards commitment and consistency.... \n \nMostly about the terrible mistakes it causes you to make. \n \nQ: How have you created an atmosphere comfortable enough for\npeople to abandon that tendency and admit that they have made a\nmistake? \n \nFor example, someone here earlier this year from Intel talked about\nproblems that occurred with their Pentium chip one of the most\ndifficult things for them to do was to realise they have been going\nabout it in the wrong way and turn course and it's very difficult to do\nthat in a complex structure how do you foster that? \n \nIntel and its ilk create a coherent culture where teams solve difficult\nproblems on the cutting edge of science. That's radically different from\nBerkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is a holding company. We've decentralized\nall the power except for natural headquarters-type capital allocation. \nBy and large, we've chosen people we admire enormously to have the\npower beneath us. It's easy for us to get along with them on average because\nwe love and admire them. And they create the culture for whatever\ninvention and reality recognition is going on in their businesses. And\n\f\nincluded in that reality recognition is the recognition that previous\nconclusions were incorrect. But we're a totally different kind of company.\nIt's not at all clear to me that Warren or I would be that good at doing what\nAndy Grove does. We don't have special competence in that field. we are\nfairly good at relating to brilliant people we love but we have defects. For\nexample, some regard me as absent minded and opinionated. I might be a\nmess at Intel. \n \nHowever, both Warren and I are very good at changing our prior\nconclusions. We work at developing that facility because, without it,\ndisaster often comes. \n \nQ: Would you talk a little bit about your seeming predilection away\nfrom investing in high Technology stocks on your own path and the\npart of Berkshire Hathaway one of the things I have found a opening\nand a little surprising is how the difficulties of running low Tech\nbusiness and dose of running a high tech business are not all that\ndifferent \n \nThey are all hard but why should it be easy to get rich? In a\ncompetitive world should not it be impossible for their to be an easy\nway to get rich for everybody? Of course they are all hard. \n \nAnd, yes-low-tech business can be plenty hard. Just try to open a restaurant\nand make it succeed\n\f\nThe reason we're not in high-tech businesses is that we have a special lack\nof aptitude in that area. And, yes-a low-tech business can be plenty hard.\nJust try to open a restaurant and make it succeed. \n \nQ: You seem to be suggesting that there's special/ aptitude required in low-\ntech business, that they're harder. But aren't they equally difficult? \n \nThe advantage of low-tech stuff for us is that we think we understand it\nfairly well. The other stuff we don't. And we'd rather deal with what we\nunderstand. \nWhy should we want to play a competitive game in a field where we have\nno advantage-maybe a disadvantage-instead of in a field where we have a\nclear advantage? \n \nEach of you will have to figure out where your talents lie. And you'll have\nto use your advantages. But if you try to succeed in what you're worst at,\nyou're going to have a very lousy career. I can almost guarantee it. To do\notherwise, you'd have to buy a winning lottery ticket or get very lucky\nsomewhere else. \n \nQ: Warren Buffett has said that the investment Berkshire made in an airline\nwas a good example of what not to do. What chain of thinking led to that\nwrong decision? \n \nWe were not buying stock in USAir on the theory that the common\nshareholders were certain to prosper-because the history of the airline\n\f\nbusiness in terms of taking care of shareholders has been terrible. It was a\npreferred stock with a mandatory redemption. In effect, we were loaning\nmoney to USAir, and we had this equity kicker. \n \nWe weren't guessing whether it would be a great place for the shareholders.\nWe were guessing whether it would remain prosperous enough to pay off a\ncredit instrument-carrying a fixed dividend and a mandatory redemption.\nAnd we guessed that the business would not get so bad that we'd have a\ncredit threat for which we were not being adequately compensated by the\nhigh rate we were getting. As it happened, USAir went right to the brink of\ngoing broke. It was hanging by a thread for several months. It's since come\nback. And we'll probably get all our money back plus the whole coupon.\nBut it was a mistake. [Editor's note: Berkshire did indeed come out whole\non its USAir investment.] \n \nThe history of the airline business in terms of taking care of shareholders\nhas been terrible. \n \nI don't want you to think we have any way of learning or behaving so you\nwon't make a lot of mistakes. I'm just saying that you can learn to make\nfewer mistakes than other people-and how to fix your mistakes faster when\nyou do make them. \n \nBut there's no way that you can live an adequate life without Making] many\nmistakes.\n\f\nIn fact, one trick in life is to get so you can handle mistakes. Failure to\nhandle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke.\nYou've made an enormous commitment to something. You've poured effort\nand money in. And the more you put in, the more that the whole\nconsistency principle makes you think, \"Now it has to work. If I put in just\na little more, then it'll work.\" \n \nPart of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that\nchange the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game wherein you have to\nlearn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand. \n \nAnd Deprival super-reaction syndrome also comes in: You're going to lose\nthe whole thing if you don't put in a little more. People go broke that way-\nbecause they can't stop, rethink, and say, \"I can afford to write this one off\nand live to fight again. I don't have to pursue this thing as an obsession-in a\nway that will break me.\" \n \nQ:  could you talk about The thoughts that went into your decision to swap\nyour capital cities stock for Disney rather than Taking cash. In the media, it\nwas reported that you mentioned thinking about taking the cash.  \n \nDisney's a perfectly marvelous company, but it's also very high-priced. Part\nof what it does is to make ordinary movies which is not a business that\nattracts me at all. However, part of what Disney has is better than a great\ngold mine. My grandchildren-I mean. those videocassettes…"

    "raw_text": "The Value of a Spouse \n \nAt age 26, Walt Disney was already the head of a successful cartoon studio\nin Hollywood, California. But business was less than rosy for the young\ncartoonist, because his principal property, Oswald the Rabbit, had just been\nwrested from his control by his financial backers. \"Mrs. Disney and I were\ncoming back from New York on the train and I had to have something I\ncould tell them,\" he recalled. \"I have lost Oswald, but I had this mouse in\nthe back of my head...\" Walt’s new creation was a little mouse in red velvet\npants named \"Mortimer.\" 'Walt's wife, Lillian, felt that was too pompous a\nname for such a cute character and suggested \"Mickey''instead. The rest is\nDisney history. \n \nDisney is an amazing example of autocatalysis.... They had all those movies\nin the can. They owned the copyright. And just as Coke could prosper when\nrefrigeration came, when the video cassette was invented, Disney didn't\nhave to invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can\nand stick it on the cassette \n \nDisney is an amazing example of autocatalysis....

And just as Coke could prosper when\nrefrigeration came, when the video cassette was invented, Disney didn't\nhave to invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can\nand stick it on the cassette. And every parent and grandparent wanted his\ndescendents to sit around and watch that stuff at home on videocassette.\n\f\nSo Disney got this enormous tail wind from life. And it was billions of\ndollars worth of tail wind. \n \nObviously, that's a marvelous model if you can find it. You don't have to\ninvent anything. All you have to do is to sit there while the world carries\nyou forward.… \n \nDisney's done a lot of new things right. Don't misunderstand me. But a lot\nof what happened to Disney was like What a friend of mine said about an\nignorant fraternity brother of his who succeeded in life: \"He was a duck\nsitting on a pond. And they raised the level of the round.\" Eisner and Wells\nwere brilliant in how they ran Disney. But the huge tail wind from\nvideocassette sales on all of the old stuff that was there when they came in,\nthat was just an automatic break for the new management. \n \nTo be fair, they have been brilliant about creating new stuff like the\npocahontas and  The Lion King the same tailwind but by the time it's done\nthe Lion King alone is going to do billions and by the way when I say when\nit's done I mean 50 years from now or something but plural billions from\none movie? \n \nQ: Could You talk about Why you left  the law \n \nI had a huge family. Nancy and I supported eight children.... And I didn't\nrealize that the law was going to get as prosperous as it suddenly got. The\n\f\nbig money came into law shortly after I left it. By 1962,l was mostly out.\nAnd I was totally out by 1965. So that was a long time ago. \nAlso, I preferred making the decisions and gambling my own money. I\nusually thought I knew better than the client anyway'. So why should I have\nto do it his way. So partly, it was having an opinionated personality And\npartly, it was a desire to get resources permitting independence. \n \n262 \n \nAlso, the bulk of my clients were terrific. But there were one or two I didn't\nenjoy. Plus, I like the independence of a capitalist. And I'd always had sort\nof a gambling personality. I like figuring things out and making bets. So I\nsimply did what came naturally. \n \nQ: Do you ever gamble Las Vegas-style? \n \nI won't bet $100 against house odds between now and the grave. I don't do\nthat. Why should I? I will gamble recreationally with my pals. And I'll\noccasionally play a much better bridge player, like Bob Hamman, who\nmight be the best card player in the world. But I know I'm paving for the\nfun of playing with him. That's recreational. \n \nAs for gambling with simple mechanical house odds against me, why in the\nworld would I ever want to do that-particularly given how I detest the\nmanipulative culture of legalized gambling. So I don't like legalized\ngambling."

If\nlosses are going to make you miserable-and some losses are inevitable-you\nmight be wise to utilize a very conservative pattern of investment and\nsaving all your life.

But it sounds like the\nsame language that Ben Graham Was saying  30 years ago he was saying\nthe stock market was overvalued when it was at 900\n\f\nThe wealth of the World will compound at no such rate. \n \nOh, I don't think that we share that with him. Graham, great though he was\nas a man, had a screw loose as he tried to predict outcomes for the stock\nmarket as a whole. In contrast, Warren and I are almost always agnostic\nabout the market. \n \nOn the other hand, we have said that common stocks generally have\ngenerated returns of ten to eleven percent after inflation for many years and\nthat those reTurns can't continue for a very long period. And they can't. It's\nsimply impossible. The wealth of the world will compound at no such rate.\nWhatever experience Stanford has had in its portfolio for the last fifteen\nyears, its future experience is virtually certain to be worse. It may still be\nokay. But it's been a hog heaven period for investors over the last fifteen\nyears. Bonanza effects of such scale can't last forever. \n \nQ: Berkshire annual report got a lot of praise for being pessimistic and for\nexpressing concern about the shrinking pool of opportunities as the\ncompany gets bigger and bigger Where does that leave you ten years from\nnow? \n \nWe've said over and over that our future rate of compounding our\nshareholders' wealth is going to go down compared to our past-and that our\nsize will be an anchor dragging on performance. And we've said over and\nover again that this is not an opinion, but a promise.\n\f\nHowever, let's suppose that we were able to compound our present book\nvalue at fifteen percent per annum from this point. That would not be so bad\nand would work out okay for our long-term shareholder. I'm just saying that\nwe could afford to slow down some, as we surely will, and still do okay for\nthe long-term shareholder. \nBy the way, I'm not promising that we will compound our present book\nvalue at fifteen percent per annum. \n \nThe Limits to Compounding \n \nThe $24 real estate investment by the Dutch to buy the island of Manhattan\nwould today, by some estimates, be roughly equivalent to $3 trillion. \nOver 378 years, that's about a seven percent annual compound rate of\nreturn. \n \nQ: You talked about how important it was not to have an extreme ideology.\nWhat responsibility, if any,  you think the business and legal communities\nhave for helping inner-city areas, spreading the wealth and so on? \n \nI'm all for fixing social problems, I'm all for being generous to the less\nfortunate. \n \nI'm all for fixing social problems. I'm all for being generous to the less\nfortunate. And I'm all for doing things where, based on a slight\n\f\npreponderance of the evidence, you guess that it's likely to do more good\nthan harm. \n \nWhat I'm against is being very confident and feeling that you know, for\nsure, that your particular intervention will do more good than harm, given\nthat you're dealing with highly complex systems wherein everything is\ninteracting with everything else. \n \nQ: So [what you're saying is to] just make sure that what you're doing [is\ndoing more \ngood] .... \n \nYou can't make sure. That's my point.... \n \nOn the other hand, I did recently reverse [the conclusions of] two sets of\nengineers. How did I have enough confidence in such a complicated field to\ndo that? Well, you might think, \"Oh, this guy is just an egomaniac who's\nmade some money and thinks he knows everything.\" \n \n268 \n \nWell, I may be an egomaniac, but I don't think I know everything. But I \nsaw huge reasons in the circumstances for bias in each set of engineers as\neach recommended a course of action very advantageous to itself. And what\neach was saying was so consonant with a natural bias that it made me"

    "raw_text": "distrust it. Also, perhaps I knew enough engineering to know that [what\nthey were saving] didn't make sense. \n \nfinally, I found a third engineer who recommended a solution I approved.\nAnd, thereafter, the second engineer came to me and said, \"Charlie, why\ndidn't I think of that?” which is to his credit. It was a much better solution,\nboth safer and cheaper. \n \nYou must have the confidence to override people with more credentials than\nyou \nwhose cognition is impaired by incentive-caused bias or some similar\npsychological force that is obviously present. But there are also cases where\nyou have to recognize that you have no wisdom to add-and that your best\ncourse is to trust some expert. \n \nIn effect, you've got to know what you know and what you don't know.\nWhat could possibly be more useful in life than that? \n \nQ: You discussed cokes mistake. Do you have any thoughts where apple\nwent wrong?\" \n \nLet me give you a very good answer-one I’m copying from Jack Welch, the\nCEO of General Electric. He has a Ph.D. in engineering. He's a star\nbusinessman. He's a marvelous guy. And recently, in Warren's presence,\nsomeone asked him, \"Jack, what did Apple do wrong?\"\n\f\nHis answer? \"I don't have any special competence that would enable me to\nanswer that question.\" And I'll give you the very same answer. That's not a\nfield in which I'm capable of giving you any special insight. \n \nOn the other hand, in copying Jack Welch, I am trying to teach you\nsomething. When you don't know and you don't have any special\ncompetence, don't be afraid to say so. \n \nThere's another type of person I compare to an example from biology:\nWhen a bee finds nectar, it comes back and does a little dance that tells the\nrest of the hive, as a matter of genetic programming, which direction to go\nand how far. So about forty or fifty years ago, some clever scientist stuck\nthe nectar straight up. Well, the nectar's never straight up in the ordinary life\nof a bee. The nectar's out. So the bee finds the nectar and returns to the hive.\nBut it doesn't have the genetic programming to do a dance that says straight\nup. So what does it do? \n \nWell, if it were like Jack Welch, it would just sit there. But what it actually\ndoes is to dance this incoherent dance that gums things up. And a lot of\npeople are like that bee. They attempt to answer a question like that. And\nthat is a huge mistake. \nNobody expects you to know everything about everything. \n \nI try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about\nwhich they don't have any real knowledge. To me, they're like the bee\ndancing its incoherent dance. They're just screwing up the hive."

    "raw_text": "Q: As someone who has been in legal practice and business, how, did you\nincorporate, or did you incorporate, these models into your legal practice?\nAnd how did it work? I suspect many \nof us have seen law firms that don't appear to adhere to these kinds of\nmodels. \n \nWell, the models are there. But just as there are perverse incentives in\nacademia, there are perverse incentives in law firms. In fact, in some\nrespects, at the law firms, it's much worse. \n \nHere's another model from law practice: When I was very young, my father\npracticed law. One of his best friends, Grant McFadyen-Omaha's Pioneer\nFord dealer-was a client. He was a perfectly marvelous man-a self-made\nIrishman who'd run away uneducated from a farm as a youth because his\nfather beat him. So he made his own way in the world. And he was a\nbrilliant man of enormous charm and integrity-just a wonderful, wonderful\nman. \n \nIn contrast, my father had another client who was a blowhard, overreaching,\nunfair, pompous, difficult man. And I must have been fourteen years old or\nthereabouts when I asked, \"Dad, why do you do so much work for Mr. X-\nthis overreaching blowhard-instead of working more for wonderful men\nlike Grant McFadyen\"\n\f\nMy father said, \"Grant McFadyen treats his employees right, his customers\nright, and his problems right. And if he gets involved with a psychotic, he\nquickly walks over to where the psychotic is and works out an exit as fast as\nhe can. Therefore, Grant McFadyen doesn't have enough remunerative law\nbusiness to keep you in Coca-Cola. But Mr. X is a walking minefield of\nwonderful legal business.\" \n \nThis case demonstrates one of the troubles with practicing law. To a\nconsiderable extent, you're going to be dealing with grossly defective\npeople. They create an enormous amount of the remunerative law business.\nAnd even when your own client is a paragon of virtue, you'll often be\ndealing with gross defectives on the other side or even on the bench. That's\npartly what drove me out of the profession. \n \nThe rest was my own greed, but my success in serving greed partly allowed\nme to make easier the process of being honorable and sensible. Like Ben\nFranklin observed, \"It's hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\" \n \ns you go through life, sell your services once in a while to an unreasonable\nblowhard if that's what you must do to feed your family. But run your own\nlife like Grant McFayden. \nThat was a great lesson. \n \nI'd argue that my father's model when I asked him about the two clients\nwas\n\f\ntotally correct dedication. He taught me the right lesson. The lesson? As\nyou go through life, sell your services once in a while to an unreasonable\nblowhard if that's what you must do to feed your family. But run your own\nlife like Grant McFayden. \nThat was a great lesson. \n \nAnd he taught it in a very clever way-because instead of just pounding it in,\nhe told it to me in a way that required a slight mental reach. And I had to\nmake the reach myself in order to get the idea that I should behave like\nGrant McFadyen. And because I had to reach for it, he figured I'd hold it\nbetter. And, indeed, I've held it all the way through until today-through all\nof these decades. That's a very clever teaching method. \n \nThere, again, we're talking about elementary psychology. It's elementary\nliterature. Good literature makes the reader reach a little for understanding.\nThen, it works better. You hold it better. It's the commitment and\nconsistency tendency. If you've reached for it, the idea's pounded in better. \n \nGood literature makes the reader reach a line for understanding. If you've\nreached for it, the idea's pounded in better. \n \nAs a lawyer or executive, you'll want to teach somebody what my father\ntaught me or maybe you'll want to teach them something else. And you can\nuse lessons like this. Isn't that a great way to teach a child? My father used\nindirection on purpose. And look at how powerfully it worked-like Captain\n\f\nCook's wise use of psychology. I've been trying to imitate Grant McFadyen\never since-for all my life. I may have had \na few lapses. But at least I've been trying. \n \nQ: At the end of your article in our OID you mentioned that only a select\nfew investment managers actually add value. Since you are speaking to an\naudience of future lawyer would you encourage to do in order to be able to\nadd value in our profession? \n \nTo the extent you become a person who chinks correctly, you can add great\nvalue. To the extent you've learned it so well that you have enough\nconfidence to intervene where it takes a little courage, you can add great\nvalue. And to the extent that you can prevent or stop some asininity that\nwould otherwise destroy your firm, your client, or something that you care\nabout, you can add great value. \n \nAnd there are constructive tricks you can use. For example, one reason why\nmy old classmate, Joe Flom of Skadden Arps, has been such a successful\nlawyer is that he's very good at dreaming up little, vivid examples that serve\nto pound the point home in a way that really works. It's enormously helpful\nwhen you're serving clients or otherwise trying to persuade someone in a\ngood cause to come up with a little \nhumorous example. \n \nThe ability to do that is a knack. So you could argue that the Joe Floms of\nthe world are almost born with a gift. But he's honed the gift. And to one\n\f\ndegree or another, all of you were born with the gift. And you can hone it,\ntoo. \n \nOccasionally, you get into borderline stuff. For instance, suppose you've got\na client who really wants to commit tax fraud. If he doesn't push the tax law\nway beyond the line, he can't stand it. He can't shave in the morning if he\nthinks there's been any cheating he could get by with that he hasn't done.\nAnd there are people like that. They just feel they aren't living aggressively\nenough. \n \nYou can approach that situation in either of two ways: (A) You can say, \"l\njust won't work for him,\" and duck it. Or, (B) you can say, \"Well, the\ncircumstances of my life require that I work for him. And what I'm doing\nfor him doesn't involve my cheating. Therefore, I'll do it.\" \n \nAnd if you see he wants to do something really stupid, it probably won't\nwork to tell him, \"What you're doing is bad. I have better morals than you.\" \n \nThat offends him. You're young. He's old. Therefore, instead of being\npersuaded, he's more likely to react with, \"Who in the hell are you to\nestablish the moral code of the whole world?\" \n \nBut, instead, you can say to him, \"You can't do that without three other\npeople beneath you knowing about it. Therefore, you're making yourself\nsubject to blackmail. You're risking your reputation. You're risking your\nfamily, your money, etc.\"\n\f\nThat is likely to work. And you're telling him something that's true. Do you\nwant to spend a lot of time working for people where you have to use\nmethods like that to get them to behave well I think the answer is no. But if\nyou're hooked with it, appealing to his interest is likely to work better as a\nmatter of human persuasion than appealing to anything else. That, again, is\na powerful psychological principle \nwith deep biological roots. \n \nI saw that psychological principle totally blown at Salomon. Salomon's\ngeneral counsel knew that the CEO, Gutfreund, should have promptly told\nthe federal authorities all about Salomon's trading improprieties in which\nGutfreund didn't participate and which he hadn't caused. And the general\ncounsel urged Gutfreund to do it. He told Gutfreund, in effect, \"You're\nprobably not legally required to do that, but it's the right thing to do. You\nreally should.\" \n \nBut it didn't work. The task was easy to put off-because it was unpleasant.\nSo that's what Gutfreund did-he put it off. \n \nAnd the general counsel had very little constituency within Salomon except\nfor the CEO. If the CEO went down, the general counsel was going down\nwith him. Therefore, his whole career was on the line. So to save his career,\nhe needed to talk the dilatory CEO into doing the right thing. \n \nIt would've been child's play to get that job done right. All the general\ncounsel had to do was to tell his boss, \"John, this situation could ruin your\n\f\nlife. You could lose your wealth. You could lose your reputation.\" And it\nwould have worked. CEOs don't like the idea of being ruined, disgraced,\nand fired. \n \nCEOs don't like the idea of being ruined, disgraced, and fired. \n \nAnd the ex-general counsel of Salomon is brilliant and generous-and he had\nthe right idea. However, he lost his job because he didn't apply a little\nelementary psychology. He failed to recognize that what works best in most\ncases is to appeal to a man's interest. \n \nBut you don't have to get similarly lousy results when you face similar\nsituations. Just remember what happened to Gutfreund and his general\ncounsel. The right lessons are easily learned if you'll work at it. And if you\ndo learn them, you can be especially useful at crucial moments when others\nfail. And to the extent that you do become wise, diligent, objective, and,\nespecially able to persuade in a good cause, then you're adding value. \n \nQ: Would you discuss how the threat of litigation-shareholder lawsuits and\nso forth and legal/ complexity in general/ have affected decision-making in\nbig business? \n \nWell, every big business screams about its legal costs, screams about the\namount of regulation, screams about the complexity of its life, screams\nabout the plaintiffs' bar-particularly the class action plaintiffs' bar. So there's\n\f\nan absolute catechism on that where you could just copy the screams from\none corporation to another and you'd hardly have to change a word. \n \nBut what causes the screams has, so far, been a godsend for the law firms.\nThe big law firms have had a long updraft. And they now tend to kind of\ncluck like an undertaker in a plague. An undertaker, of course, would look\nvery unseemly if he were jumping up and down and playing his fiddle\nduring the plague. So law firm partners say, \"Oh, isn't it sad-all this\ncomplexity, all this litigation, all this unfairness.\" \n \nAn undertaker of course, would look very unseemly if he were jumping up\nand down and playing his fiddle during the plague. \n \nBut, really, they're somewhat schizophrenic on the subject because it's been\nvery good for [them]. Some recent California initiatives created some\ninteresting conduct. Part of the defense bar lobbied quietly against certain\npropositions and, effectively, against their clients because they didn't want\ntheir clients to catch 'em in the process. And the reason that they did so was\nbecause it became harder for plaintiffs to bring cases. \n \nIf you make a living fighting overreaching and it keeps your children in\nschool and somebody proposes a system that eliminates it-well, that's an\nadult experience and an adult choice that you have to make. So big\ncorporations adapt. They have more litigation. They have to have a bigger\nlegal department. They scream about what they don't like. But they adapt.\n\f\nQ: But hasn't that legal complexity consumed a lot more of companies'\nresources over the last few decades? \n \nThe answer yes. There's hardly a corporation in America that isn't spending\nmore on lawsuits and on compliance with various regulations than it was\ntwenty years ago. And, yes, some of the new regulation is stupid and\nfoolish. And some was damn well necessary. And it will ever be thus, albeit\nwith some ebb and flow. \n \nQ: But have you seen or experienced any change in decision making at\ncorporations in their being less likely to take on riskier investments for fear\nof failure or liability? \n \nThe only place I saw-with another friend, not Warren [Buffett]-[was where]\nI was part owner of the biggest shareholder in a company that invented a\nbetter policeman's heel-rest. It was made of Kevlar or something of that\nsort. And they brought it to us and wanted us to [manufacture] it \n \nAs a matter of ideology, we're very pro-police. I believe civilization needs a\npolice force-although I don't believe in policemen creating too many\nwidows and orphans unnecessarily either. But we like the idea of a better\npoliceman's helmet. \n \nHowever, we took one look at it and said to the people who invented it,\n\"We're a rich corporation. We can't afford to make a better policeman's\n\f\nhelmet. That's just how the civilization works. All risks considered, it can't\nwork for us. But we want the civilization to have these.\" \n \n\"So we don't maximize what we sell it for it. Get somebody else to make it.\nTransfer the technology or whatever to somebody who can do it. But we're\nnot going to.\" \n \nThus, we didn't try to disadvantage policemen [by keeping them from]\ngetting new helmets, but we decided not to manufacture helmets ourselves. \n \nThere are businesses-given the way the civilization has developed-where\nbeing the only deep pocket around is bad business. In high school football,\nfor example, a paraplegic or quadriplegic will inevitably be created\noccasionally. And who with deep pockets can the injured person best sue\nother than the helmet manufacturer? Then everyone feels sorry, the injuries\nare horrible, and the case is dangerous for the manufacturer. . .. \n \nI think big, rich corporations are seldom wise to make football helmets in\nthe kind of a civilization we're in. And maybe it should be harder to\nsuccessfully sue helmet makers. \n \nI think big, rich corporations are seldom wise to make football helmets in\nthe kind of a civilization we're in \n \nI know two different doctors-each of whom had a sound marriage. And\nwhen the malpractice premiums got high enough, they divorced their wives\n\f\nand transferred most of their property to their wives. And they continued to\npractice-only without malpractice insurance. \n \nThey're angry at the civilization. They needed to adapt. And they trusted\ntheir wives. So that was that. And they've not carried any malpractice\ninsurance since. \n \nPeople adapt to a changing litigation climate. They have various ways of\ndoing it. That's how' it's always been and how it's always going to be. \n \nI like the Navy system. If you're a captain in the Navy and you've been up\nfor \ntwenty-four hours straight and have to go to sleep and you turn the ship\nover to a \ncompetent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship aground-\nclearly through no fault of yours-they don't court-martial you, but your\nnaval career is over. \n \nWhat I personally hate most are systems that make fraud easy. Probably\nway more than half of all the chiropractic income in California comes from\npure fraud. For example, I have a friend who had a little fender bender-an\nauto accident-in a tough neighborhood. And he got two chiropractors cards\nand one lawyer's card before he'd even left the intersection. They're in the\nbusiness of manufacturing claims that necks hurt.\n\f\nIn California, I believe the Rand statistics showed that we have twice as\nmany personal injuries per accident as in many other states. And we are not\ngetting twice as much real injury par accident the other half of that is fraud\npeople just get so that they think everybody does it it is alright to do so. I\nthink it is terrible to let that stuff creepin  \n \nIf I were running the civilization, compensation for stress in Workers\ncompensation would be zero not because there is no work causes stress. but\nbecause I think the net social damage of allowing stress to be compensated\nat all is worse than what would happen if a few people that had real work-\ncaused stress injuries went uncompensated. \n \nI like the Navy system. If you're a captain in the Navy and you've been up\nfor twenty-four hours straight and have to go to sleep and you turn the ship\nover to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship\naground-clearly through no fault of yours-they don't court-martial you, but\nyour naval career is over. \n \nYou can say, \"That's too tough. That's not law school. That's not due\nprocess.\" \nWell, the Navy model is better in its context than would be the law school\nmodel. The Navy model really forces people to pay attention when\nconditions are tough because they know that there's no excuse. \n \nNapoleon said he liked luckier general-he wasn't into suPporting losers.\nWell, the Navy likes luckier captains.\n\f\nIt doesn't matter why your ship goes aground, your career is over. Nobody's\ninterested in your fault. It's just a rule that we happen to have-for the good\nof all, all effects considered. \n \nI like some rules like that. I think that the civilization works better with\nsome of these no-fault rules. But that stuff tends to be anathema around law\nschools. \"It's not due process. You're not really searching for justice.\" \n \nWell, I am searching for justice when I argue for the Navy rule-for the\njustice of fewer ships going aground. Considering the net benefit, I don't\ncare if one captain has some unfairness in his life. After all, it's not like he's\nbeing court martialed. He just has to look for a new line of work. And he\nkeeps vested pension rights and so on. So it's not like it's the end of the\nworld. \n \nSo I like things like that. However, I'm in a minority. \n \nQ: I'd like to hear you talk a little bit more about judgment. In your talk,\nyou said we should read the psychology textbooks and the title fifteen or\nsixteen principles that are best of the ones that make sense . . .. \nThe ones that are obviously important and obviously right. That's correct....\nAnd then you stick in the ones that are obviously important and not in the\nbooks-and you've got a system.\n\f\nQ: Right my problem seems to be the prior step which is determining which\nare obviously right and That seems to me to be more essential question to\nask. \n \nWell, if you're like me, it's kind of fun for it to be a little complicated. If you\nwant it totally easy and totally laid out, maybe you should join some cult\nthat claims to provide all the answers \n \nNo, no. You overestimate the difficulty. Do you have difficulty\nunderstanding that people are heavily influenced by what other people think\nand what other people do-and that some of that happens on a subconscious\nlevel? \n \nQ: No,I don't. I understand that \nWell, you can go right through the principles. And, one after another,\nthey're like that. It's not that hard. . .. \n \nDo you have any difficulty with the idea that operant conditioning works-\nthat people will repeat what worked for them the last time? \n \nQ: It just seems to me like there's a lot of other things out there, as well, that\nalso make a lot of sense . The system would quickly get too complicated, I\nimagine-as a result of too much cross-talk. \n \nWell, if you're like me, it's kind of fun for it to be a little complicated. If you\nwant it totally easy and totally laid out, maybe you should join some cult\n\f\nthat claims to provide all the answers. I don't think that's a good way to go. I\nthink you'll just have to endure the world-as complicated as it is. Einstein\nhas a marvelous statement on that: \"Everything should be made as simple as\npossible, but no more simple.\" \n \nI'm afraid that's the way it is. If there are twenty factors and they interact\nsome, you'll just have to learn to handle it-because that's the way the world\nis. But you won't find it that hard if you go at it Darwin-like, step by step\nwith curious persistence. You'll be amazed at how good you can get. \n \nQ: You've given us about three of the models that you use. I wondered\nwhere you found the other ones. And, second, do you have an easier way\nfor us to find them than going through a psychology, textbook? I'm not\naverse to doing that, but it takes longer. \n \nThere are a relatively small number of disciplines and a relatively small\nnumber of truly big ideas. And it's a lot of fun to figure it out. Plus, if you\nfigure it out and do the outlining yourself, the ideas will stick better than if\nyou memorize 'em using somebody else's cram list. \n \nEven better, the fun never stops. I was miseducated horribly. And I hadn't\nbothered to pick up what's called modern Darwinism. I do a lot of\nmiscellaneous reading, too. But I just missed it. And in the last year, I\nsuddenly realized I was a total damned fool and hadn't picked it up\nproperly. So I went back. And with the aid of Dawkins-Oxford's great\nbiologist-and others, I picked it up\n\f\nWell, it was an absolute circus for me in my seventies to get the modern\nDarwinian synthesis in my head. It's so awesomely beautiful and so\nawesomely right. And it's so simple once you get it. So one beauty of my\napproach is that the fun never stops. I suppose that it does stop eventually\nwhen you're drooling in the convalescent home at the end. But, at least, it\nlasts a long time. \n \nIf I were czar of a law school-although, of course, no law school will permit\na czar (they don't even want the dean to have much power)-I'd create a\ncourse that I'd call \"Remedial Worldly Wisdom\" that would, \namong other useful things, include a fair amount of properly taught\npsychology. And it might last three weeks or a month.… \n \nI think you could create a course that was so interesting with pithy\nexamples and powerful examples and powerful principles-that it would be a\ntotal circus. And I think that it would make \nthe whole law school experience work better. \n \nPeople raise their eyebrows at that idea. \"People don't do that kind of\nthing.\" They may not like the derision that's implicit in the title: \"Remedial\nWorldly Wisdom.\" But the title would be my way of announcing,\n\"Everybody ought to know this.\" And, if you call it remedial, isn't that what\nyou're saying? \"This is really basic and everybody has to know it.\"\n\f\nSuch a course would be a perfect circus. The examples are so legion. I don't\nsee why people don't do it. They may not do it mostly because they don't\nwant to. Bur also, maybe they don't know how And maybe they don't know\nwhat it is. \n \nBut the whole law school experience would be much more fun if the really\nbasic ideas were integrated and pounded in with good examples for a month\nor so before you got into conventional law school material. I think the\nwhole system of education would work better. But nobody has any interest\nin doing it. \n \n283 \n \nAnd when law schools Do reach out beyond traditional material they often\ndo it and what looks to me like a pretty damn way you think psychology is\nbadly taught in America you should look at corporate finance portfolio\ntheory? It's demented. It's truly amazing \nI don't know how these things happen at science and engineering tend to be\npretty reliable done but the minute you go outside of the various certain\namount of insanity schemes to Creep into Academia even in Academia\ninvolving  people with very high IQ \n \nMany of the legal doctrines are tied to other doctrines. They're joined at the\nhip. And, !yet, they teach you those legal doctrines without pointing out\nhow they're tied to the other important doctrines. That's insanity absolute\ninsanity.\n\f\nOn the other hand, a month at the start of law school that really pounded in\nthe basic doctrines. . .. Many of the legal doctrines are tied to other\ndoctrines. They're joined at the hip. And, yet, they teach you those legal\ndoctrines without pointing out how they're tied to the other important\ndoctrines?! That's insanity-absolute insanity. \nWhy do we have a rule that judges shouldn't talk about legal issues that\naren't before them? In my day, they taught us the rule, but not in a way\ngiving reasons tied to the guts of undergraduate courses. It's crazy that\npeople don't have those reasons. The human mind is not constructed so that\nit works well without having reasons. You've got to hang reality on a\ntheoretical structure with reasons. That's the way it hangs together in usable\nform so that you're an effective thinker. And to teach doctrines-either with\nno reasons or with poorly explained reasons?! That's wrong! Another\nreason why I like the idea of having a course on remedial worldly wisdom\nis that it would force more sense on the professors. It would be awkward for\nthem to teach something that was contravened by lessons that were\nobviously correct and emphasized in a course named \"Remedial Worldly\nWisdom.\" Professors doing so would really have to justify themselves. Is\nthat a totally crazy idea? It may be crazy to expect it to be done. However,\nif somebody had done it, would you have found it useful? \n \nI'm always asked this question: \"Spoon-feed me what you know).\" And, of\ncourse, what they are often saying is, \"Teach me now, to get rich with soft\nwhite hands faster. And not only let me get rich faster but teach me faster,\ntoo\n\f\nQ: I think it would be a wonderful thing to have. Unfortunately, when it's\ncreated, we won't be here anymore. You're proposing that this would be\ngood to teach people in a course form so it would be accessible to them. Is\nthere any way that it could be more accessible to us-other than having to... \n \nI get requests for pointers to easy learning all the time. And I'm trying to\nprovide a little easy learning today. But one talk like this is not the right\nway to do it. The right way to do it would be in a book. \n \nI hope what I'm saving will help you be more effective and better human\nbeings. And if you don't get rich, that won't bother me. But I'm always\nasked this question: \"Spoon-feed me what you know.\" And, of course, what\nthey're often saying is, \"Teach me how to get rich with soft white hands\nfaster. And not \nonly let me get rich faster, but teach me faster, too.\" \n \nI don't have much interest in writing a book myself. Plus it would be a lot of\nwork for somebody like me to try and do it in my seventies. And I have\nplenty else to do in life. So I'm not going to do it. But it's a screaming\nopportunity for somebody. And I'd provide funds to support the writing of\nan appropriate book if I found someone with the wisdom and the will to do\nthe job right. \n \nLet me turn to some of the probable reasons for present bad education.

    "raw_text": "psychology is most powerful when combined with doctrines from other\nacademic departments. But if your psychology professor doesn't know the\nother doctrines, then he isn't capable of doing the necessary integration. \n \nAnd how would anyone get to be a psychology professor in the first place if\nhe were good with non psychology doctrines and constantly worked non\npsychology doctrines into his material? Such a would-be professor would\nusually offend his peers and superiors. \n \nThere have been some fabulous psychology professors in the history of the\nworld. Cialdini Arizona State was very useful to me, as was B. E Skinner-\nfor his experimental results, if divorced from his monomania and\nutopianism. But averaged out, I don't believe that psychology professors in\nAmerica are people whose alternative career paths were in the toughest part\nof physics. And that may be one of the reasons why they don't get it quite\nright. \n \nThe schools of education, even at eminent universities, are pervaded by\npsychology'-. And they're almost an intellectual disgrace. It's not unheard of\nfor academic departments even at great institutions-to be quite deficient in\nimportant ways. And including a lot of material labeled as psychological is\nno cure-all. \n \nAnd given academic inertia, all academic deficiencies are very hard to fix.\nDo you know how they tried to fix psychology at the university of Chicago?\n\f\nHaving tenured professors who were terrible, the president there actually\nabolished the entire psychology department. \n \nAnd Chicago, in due course, will probably bring back a new and different\npsychology department. Indeed, by now, it probably has. Perhaps conditions\nare now better. And I must admit that I admire a college president who will\ndo something like that. \n \nI do not wish to imply in my criticism that the imperfections of academic\npsychology teaching are all attributable to some kind of human fault\ncommon only to such departments. Instead, the causes of many of the\nimperfections lie deep in the nature of things-in irritating peculiarities that\ncan't be removed from psychology. \n \nLet me demonstrate by a \"thought experiment\" involving a couple of\nquestions: Are there not many fields that need a synthesizing super-mind\nlike that of James Clerk Maxwell, but are destined never to attract one? And\nis academic psychology, by its nature, one of the most unfortunate of all the\nwould-be attractors of superminds? I think the answers are yes and yes. \n \nOne can see this by considering the case of any of the few members of each\ngeneration who can, as fast as fingers can move, accurately work through\nthe problem sets in thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and physical\nchemistry. Such a person u,ill be begged by some of the most eminent\npeople alive to enter the upper reaches of hard science.\n\f\nWill such a super-gifted person instead choose academic psychology\nwherein lie verb awkward realities: (A) that the tendencies demonstrated by\nsocial psychology paradoxically grow weaker as more people learn them,\nand, (B) that clinical (patient treating) psychology has to deal with the\nawkward reality that \nhappiness, physiologically measured, is often improved by believing things\nthat are not true the answer, I think, is plainly no. The super-mind will be\nrepelled by academic psychology much as Nobel laureate physicist Max\nPlanck was repelled by economics, wherein he saw problems that wouldn't -\nyield to his methods. \n \nQ: We talk a lot about takeoffs between the quality of our life and our\nprofessional/ commitments. Is there time for a professional life, learning\nabout these models, and doing whatever else interests you? Do .you find\ntime to do fun things besides learning? \n \nI've always taken a fair amount of time to do what I really wanted to do\nsome \nof which was merely to fish or play bridge or play golf. \n \nEach of us must figure out his or her own lifestyle. You may want to work \nseventy hours a week for ten years to make partner at Cravath and thereby\nobtain the obligation to do more of the same. Or you may say, \"I'm not\nwilling to pay that price.\" \nEither way, it's a totally personal decision that you have to make by your\nown lights.\n\f\nBut, whatever you decide, I think it's a huge mistake not to absorb\nelementary worldly wisdom if you're capable of doing it because it makes\nyou better able to serve others, it makes you better able to serve .yourself,\nand it makes life more fun. So if you have an aptitude for doing it, I think\nyou'd be crazy not to. Your life will be enriched-not only financially, but in\na host of other ways-if you do. \n \nNow this has been a very peculiar talk for some businessman to come in\nand give at a law school-some guy who's never taken a course in\npsychology telling you that all of the psychology textbooks are wrong. This\nis very eccentric. But all I can tell you is that I'm sincere. \n \nThere's a lot of simple stuff that many of you are quite capable of learning.\nAnd your lives will work way better too, if you do. Plus, Learning it is a lot\nof fun. So I urge you to learn it \n \nQ: Are you, in effect,fulfilling your responsibility to share the wisdom that\nyou've \nacquired over the years? \n \nSure. Look at Berkshire Hathaway. I call it the ultimate didactic enterprise.\nWarren's never going to spend any money. He's going to give it all back to\nsociety. He's just building a platform so people will listen to his notions.\nNeedless to say, they're very good notions. And the platform's not so bad\n\f\neither. But you could argue that Warren and I are academics in our own\nway. \n \nQ: Most of what you've said is very compelling. And your quest for\nknowledge and, therefore, command of the human condition and money are\nall laudable goals. \n \nI'm not sure the quest for money is so laudable. \n \nQ : Well, then-understandable. \n \nThat I'll take. I don't sneer, incidentally, bond indentures. If you need the\nmoney, it's a bunch of cases in the course of your career, ought to do\nsomething to earn money. Many you earn money. at making sales calls or\nproofreading fun earning it. And if you have to try you'll learn something\ndoing that. You activities are dignified by the fact that \n \nQ: I understand your skepticism about overly ideological people. But is\nthere an ideological component to what you do? Is there something that\nyou're irrationally passionate about? \nYeah, I'm passionate about wisdom. I'm passionate about accuracy and\nsome kinds of curiosity. Perhaps I have some streak of generosity in my\nnature and a desire to serve values that transcend my brief life. But maybe\nI'm just here to show off. Who knows?"

I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up\nyourself. \nNobody's that smart.... \n \n\"The best that is known and taught in the world nothing less can satisfy a\nteacher worthy of the name.\" \nSir William Osler \n \nTalk Three Revisited \n \nWhen I gave Talk Three in 1996,I argued that intense political animosity\nshould be avoided because it causes much mental malfunction, even in\nbrilliant brains. Since then, political animosity has increased greatly, both\non the left and right, with sad effects on the ability of people to recognize\nreality, exactly as I would have expected. \n \nNaturally, I don't like this result. The grain of my emotional nature is to\nrespond as Archimedes might respond if he complained now to God: \"How\ncould you put in those dark ages after I published my formulas?\" Or as\nMark Twain once complained: \"These are sad days in literature. Homer is\ndead. Shakespeare is dead. And I myself am not feeling at all well.\" \n \nFortunately, I am still able to refrain from complaint in the mode of Mark\nTwain. After all, I never had more than a shred of an illusion that any views\nof mine would much change the world. Instead, I always knew that aiming\n\f\nlow was the best path for me, and so I merely sought (1) to learn from my\nbetters a few practical mental tricks that would help me avoid some of the\nworst miscognitions common in my age cohort, and (2) to pass on my\nmental tricks only to a few people who could easily learn from me because\nthey already almost knew what I was telling them. Having pretty well\naccomplished these very limited objectives, I see little reason to complain\nnow about the un-wisdom of the world. Instead, what works best for me in\ncoping with all disappointment is what I call the Jewish method: humor. \n \nAs I revisit talk Three in March of 2006,I still like its emphasis on the\ndesirability of making human systems as cheating-proof as is practicable,\neven if this leaves some human misery unfixed. After all, the people who\ncreate rewarded cheating on a massive scale leave a trail of super-ruin in\ntheir wake, since the bad conduct spreads by example and is so very hard to\nreverse. \n \nAnd I fondly recall Talk Three's emphasis on both the life-handling lessons\nI learned from my father's friend, Grant McFadyen, and one teaching\nmethod I learned from my father. I owe a lot to these long-dead\npredecessors, and if you like Poor Charlie’s Almanack. so do you. \n \nIn this talk, Charlie explains how he makes decisions and solves problems\nby taking us step-by-step through a diverse set of \"mental models.\" He\npresents a case study that asks rhetorically how the listener would go about\nproducing a $2 trillion business from scratch, using as his example Coca-\nCola. Naturally, he has his own solution, apt to strike you as both brilliant"

    "raw_text": "capital of $2 million into $2 trillion, a sum large enough to represent a\npractical achievement. Then, I will try to solve the problem, assisted by -y\nhelpful general notions. Following that, I will suggest that there are\nimportant educational implications in my demonstration. I will so finish\nbecause my objective is educational, my game today being a search for\nbetter methods of thought. The first helpful notion is that it is usually best to\nsimplify problems by deciding big \"no-brainer\" questions first. \n \nThe second helpful notion mimics Galileo's conclusion that scientific reality\nis often revealed only by math as if math was the language of God. Galileo's\nattitude also works well in messy, practical life. Without numerical Fluency,\nin the part of life most of us inhabit, you are like a one-legged man in an\nass-kicking contest. \nThe third helpful notion is that it is not enough to think problems through\nforward. You must also think in reverse, much like the rustic who wanted to\nknow where he was going to die so that he'd never go there. Indeed, many\nproblems can't be solved forward. And that is why the great algebraist Carl\nJacobi so often said, \"Invert, always invert.\" And why the Pythagoreans\nthought in reverse to prove that the square root of two was an irrational\nnumber. \n \n294 \n \nIt is not usually the conscious malfeasance of your narrow professional\nadviser that does you in. Instead., your troubles come from his\nsubconscious bias.\n\f\nThe fourth helpful notion is that the best and most practical wisdom is\nelementary academic wisdom. But there is one extremely important\nqualification: You must think in a multidisciplinary manner. You must\nroutinely use all the easy-to learn concepts from the freshman course in\nevery basic subject. Where elementary ideas will serve, your problem\nsolving must not be limited, as academia and many business bureaucracies\nare limited, by extreme balkanization into disciplines and subdisciplines,\nwith strong taboos against any venture outside assigned territory. instead,\nyou must do your multidisciplinary thinking in accord with Ben Franklin's\nprescription in Poor Richard: \"If you want it done, go. If not, send.\" \n \nIf, in your thinking, you rely entirely on others, often through purchase of\nprofessional advice, whenever outside a small territory of your own, you\nwill suffer much calamity. And it is not just difficulties in complex\ncoordination that will do you in. You will also suffer from the reality\nevoked by the Shavian character who said, \"In the last analysis, every\nprofession is a conspiracy against the laity.\" Indeed, a Shavian character, for\nonce, understated the horrors of something Shaw didn't like. It is not usually\nthe conscious malfeasance of your narrow professional adviser that does\nyou in. Instead, your troubles come from his subconscious bias. His\ncognition will often be impaired, for your purposes, by financial incentives\ndifferent from yours. And he will also suffer from the psychological defect\ncaught by the proverb: \"To a man with a hammer, every problem looks like\na nail.\"\n\f\nThe fifth helpful notion is that really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will\noften come only from large combinations of factors. For instance,\ntuberculosis was tamed, at least for a long time, only by routine, combined\nuse in each case of three different drugs. And other lollapalooza effects, like\nthe flight of an airplane, follow a similar pattern. \n \nIt is now time to present my practical problem. \nAnd here is the problem: \n \nIt is 1884 in Atlanta. You are brought, along with twenty others like you,\nbefore a rich and eccentric Atlanta citizen named Glotz. Both you and Glotz\nshare two characteristics: First, you routinely use in problem solving the\nfive helpful notions, and, second, you know all the elementary ideas in all\nthe basic college courses, as taught in 1996. However, all discoverers and\nall examples demonstrating these elementary ideas come from dates before\n1884. Neither you nor Glotz knows anything about anything that has\nhappened after 1884. \n \nGlotz offers to invest two million 1884 dollars, yet take only half the equity,\nfor a Glotz Charitable Foundation, in a new corporation organized to go\ninto the non-alcoholic beverage business and remain in that business only,\nforever. Glotz wants to use a name that has somehow charmed him: Coca-\nCola. \n \nThe other half of the new corporation's equity will go to the man who most\nplausibly demonstrates that his business plan will cause Glotz's foundation\n\f\nto be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the money of that later time,\n2034, despite paying our a large part of its earnings each year as a dividend.\nThis will make the whole new corporation worth $2 trillion, even after\npaying out many billions of dollars in dividends. \n \nYou have fifteen minutes to make your pitch. What do you say to Glotz? \n \nHere is my solution, my pitch to Glotz, using only the helpful notions and\nwhat every bright college sophomore should know. \n \nWell, Glotz, the big \"no-brainer\" decisions that, to simplify our problem,\nshould be made first are as follows: First, we are never going to create\nsomething worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. Therefore,\nwe must make your name, \"Coca-Cola,\" into a strong legally protected\ntrademark. Second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in Atlanta, then\nsucceeding in the rest of the united States, then rapidly succeeding with our\nnew beverage all over the world. This will require developing a product\nhaving universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental forces.\nAnd the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is in the subject\nmatter of elementary academic courses. \n \nWe will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target implies. We\ncan guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be about eight billion beverage\nconsumers in the world. On average, each of these consumers will be much\nmore prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884. Each\nconsumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about sixty-four\n\f\nounces of water per day. This is eight, eight ounce servings. Thus, if our\nnew beverage, and other imitative beverages in our new market, can flavor\nand otherwise improve only twenty-five percent of ingested water\nworldwide, and we can occupy half of the new world market, we can sell\n2.92 trillion eight-ounce servings in 2034. And if we can then net four cents\nper serving, we will earn $117 billion. This will be enough, if our business\nis still growing at a good rate, to make it easily worth $2 trillion. \n \nIn essence, we are going into the business of creating and maintaining\nconditioned reflexes. \n \nA big question, of course, is whether four cents per serving is a reasonable\nprofit target for 2034. And the answer is yes if we can create a beverage\nwith strong universal appeal. One hundred fifty years is a long time. The\ndollar, like the Roman drachma, will almost surely suffer monetary\ndepreciation. Concurrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage\nconsumer in the world will go way up. His proclivity to inexpensively\nimprove his experience while ingesting water will go up considerably faster.\nMeanwhile, as technology improves, the cost of our simple product, in units\nof constant purchasing power, will go down. All four factors will work\ntogether in favor of our four-cents-per-serving profit target. Worldwide\nbeverage-purchasing power in dollars will probably multiply by a factor of\nat least forty over 150 years. Thinking in reverse, this makes our profit-per-\nserving target, under l88r conditions. a mere One fortieth of four cent or\none tenth of a cent per serving this is an easy to exceed target as we\nstart out if our new product has Universal appeal"

    "raw_text": "Ivan Pavlov (1849-r936) \nIvan Pavlov was born in central Russia and attended seminary until age\ntwenty-one, when he abandoned theology in favor of chemistry and\nphysiology. Earning his M.D. in 1883, he excelled in physiology and\nsurgical techniques. Later, he studied the secretory activity of digestion and\nultimately formulated the laws of conditioned reflexes. \n \nPavlov's most famous experiment showed that dogs tend to salivate before\nfood is actually delivered to their mouths. This result led him to a long\nseries of experiments in which he manipulated the stimuli occurring before\nthe presentation of food. He thereby established the basic laws for the\nestablishment and section of what he called \"conditional reflexes,\" later\nmistranslated from the original Russian as \"conditioned reflexes.\" He was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in l904 for his work on digestive secretions. \n \n298 \n \nThat decided, we must next solve the problem of invention to create\nUniversal appeal there are two inter wind challenges of large scale\nfirst over 150 years we must cause a new beverage market to\nassimilate about one fourth of world's water injection second we\nmust so operate that half the new market is hours while all our\ncompetitors combined I left to share the remaining these results are\nlollapalooza results accordingly we must attack our problem by\ncausing every favourable factor we can think of to work for us plainly\n\f\nonly a powerful combination of many factors is likely to cause the\nlollapalooza consequences we Desire fortunately, the solution to the\nwinter wind problems turns out to be very easy if one has stayed\nawake in all the freshman courses. \n \n\"I want a can of Coke within arms reach of every American\nservicemen something to remind him of home.\" \n-Dwight D, Eisenhower; Supreme Allied Commander, world War II \n \nLet us start by exploring the consequences of our simplifying \"no-\nbrainer\" decision that we must rely on a strong trademark. This conclusion\nautomatically leads to an understanding of the essence of our business in\nproper elementary academic terms. We can see from the introductory course\nin psychology that, in essence, we are going into the business of creating\nand maintaining conditioned reflexes. The \"Coca-Cola\" trade name and\ntrade dress will act as the stimuli, and the purchase and ingestion of our\nbeverage will be the desired responses. \n \nThe \"Coca-Cola\" trade name and trade dress will act as the stimuli, and the\npurchase and ingestion of our beverage will be the desired responses. \n \nAnd how does one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? Well, the\npsychology text gives two answers: (1) by operant conditioning and (2) by\nclassical conditioning, often called Pavlovian conditioning to honor the\ngreat Russian scientist. And, since we want a lollapalooza result, we must\nuse both conditioning techniques-and all we can invent to enhance effects\n\f\nfrom each technique. The operant conditioning part of our problem is easy\nto solve. We need only (1) maximize rewards of our beverage's ingestion\nand (2) minimize possibilities that desired reflexes, once created by us, will\nbe extinguished through operant conditioning by proprietors of competing\nproducts. \n \nFor operant conditioning rewards, there are only a few categories we will\nfind practical: \n(l) Food value in calories or other inputs; \n(2) Flavor, texture, and aroma acting as stimuli to consumption under neural\nreprogramming of man through Darwinian natural selection; \n(3) Stimulus, as by sugar or caffeine; \n(4) Cooling effect when man is too hot or warming effect when man is too\ncool. \n \nWanting a lollapalooza result, we will naturally include rewards in all the\ncategories. To start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for\nconsumption cold. There is much less opportunity, without ingesting\nbeverage, to counteract excessive heat compared with excessive cold.\nMoreover, with excessive heat, much liquid must be consumed, and the\nreverse is not true. It is also easy to decide to include both sugar and\ncaffeine. After all, tea, coffee, and lemonade are already widely consumed.\nAnd, it is also clear that we must be fanatic about determining, through trial\nand error, flavor and other characteristics that will maximize human\npleasure while taking in the sugared water and caffeine we will provide.\nAnd, to counteract possibilities that desired operant-conditioned reflexes,\n\f\nonce created by us, will be extinguished by operant-conditioning-employing\ncompeting products, there is also an obvious answer: We will make it a\npermanent obsession in our company that our beverage, as fast as\npracticable, will at all times be available everywhere throughout the world.\nAfter all, a competing product, if it is never tried, can't act as a reward\ncreating a conflicting habit. Every spouse knows that. a competing product,\nif it is never tried, can't act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. Every\nspouse knows that \n \nWe must next consider the Pavlovian conditioning we must also use. In\nPavlovian conditioning, powerful effects come from mere association. The\nneural system of Pavlov's dog causes it to salivate at the bell it can't eat.\nAnd the brain of man yearns for the type of beverage held by the pretty\nwoman he can't have. And so, Glotz, we must use every sort of decent,\nhonorable Pavlovian conditioning we can think of. For as long as we are in\nbusiness, our beverage and its promotion must be associated in consumer\nminds with all other things consumers like or admire. \n \nAnd the brain of man yearns for the type of beverage held by the pretty\nwoman he can't have. \n \nSuch extensive Pavlovian conditioning will cost a lot of money, particularly\nfor advertising. We will spend big money as far ahead as we can imagine.\nBut the money will be effectively spent. As we expand fast in our new-\nbeverage market, our competitors will face gross disadvantages of scale in\nbuying advertising to create the Pavlovian conditioning they need. And this\n\f\noutcome, along with other volume creates-power effects, should help us\ngain and hold at least fifty percent of the new market everywhere. Indeed,\nprovided buyers are scattered, our higher volumes will give us very extreme\ncost advantages in distribution. \n \nMoreover, Pavlovian effects from mere association will help us choose the\nflavor, texture, and color of our new beverage. Considering Pavlovian\neffects, we will have wisely chosen the exotic and expensive-sounding\nname \"Coca-Cola,\" instead of a pedestrian name like \"Glotz's Sugared,\nCaffeinated Water.\" For similar Pavlovian reasons, it will be wise to have\nour beverage look pretty much like wine instead of sugared water. And so,\nwe will artificially color our beverage if it comes out clear. And we will\ncarbonate our water, making our product seem like champagne, or some\nother expensive beverage, while also making its flavor better and imitation\nharder to arranGe for competing products. And, because we are going to\nattach so many expensive psychological effects to our flavor, that flavor\nshould be different from any other standard flavor so that we maximize\ndifficulties for competitors and give no accidental  same-flavor benefit of\nany existing product. \n \nWhat else, from the psychology textbook, can help our new business? Well,\nthere is chat powerful \"monkey-see, monkey-do\" aspect of human nature\nthat psychologists often call \"social proof.\" Social proof, imitative\nconsumption triggered by mere sight of consumption, will not only help\ninduce trial of our beverage. It will also bolster perceived rewards from\nconsumption. We will always take this powerful social-proof factor into\n\f\naccount as we design advertising and sales promotion and as we forego\npresent profit to enhance present and future consumption. More than with\nmost other products, increased selling power will come from each increase\nin sales. \n \nWe can now see, Glotz, that by combining (1) much Pavlovian\nconditioning, (2) powerful social-proof effects, and (3) a wonderful-tasting,\nenergy-giving, stimulating, and desirably cold beverage that causes much\noperant conditioning, we are going to get sales that speed up for a long time\nby reason of the huge mixture of factors we have chosen. Therefore, we are\ngoing to start something like an autocatalytic reaction in chemistry,\nprecisely the sort of multifactor-triggered lollapalooza effect we need. \n \nThe logistics and the distribution strategy of our business will be simple.\nThere are only two practical ways to sell our beverage: (1) as syrup to\nfountains and restaurants and (2) as a complete carbonated-water product in\ncontainers. Wanting lollapalooza results, we will naturally do it both ways.\nAnd, wanting huge Pavlovian and social-proof effects, we will always\nspend on advertising and sales promotion, per serving, over forty percent of\nthe fountain price for syrup needed to make the serving. \n \nA few syrup-making plants can serve the world. However, to avoid needless\nshipping of mere space and water, we will need many bottling plants\nscattered over the world. We will maximize profits if (like early General\nElectric with light bulbs) we always set the first-sale price, either (1) for\nfountain syrup or (2) for any container of our complete product. The best\n\f\nway to arrange this desirable profit-maximizing control is to make any\nindependent bottler we need a subcontractor, not a vendee of syrup, and\ncertainly not a vendee of syrup under a perpetual franchise specifying a\nsyrup price frozen forever at its starting level. \n \nBeing unable to get a patent or copyright on our super important flavor, we\nwill work obsessively to keep our formula secret. We will make a big\nhoopla over our secrecy, which will enhance Pavlovian effects. Eventually,\nfood-chemical engineering will advance so that our flavor can be copied\nwith near exactitude. But, by that time, we will be so far ahead, with such\nstrong trademarks and complete, \"always available\" worldwide distribution,\nthat good flavor copying won't bar us from our objective. Moreover, the\nadvances in food chemistry that help competitors will almost surely be\naccompanied by technological advances that will help us, including\nrefrigeration, better transportation, and, for dieters, ability to insert a sugar\ntaste without inserting sugar's calories. Also, there will be related beverage\nopportunities we will seize. \n \nThis brings us to a final reality check for our business plan. We will, once\nmore, think in reverse like Jacobi. What must we avoid because we don't\nwant it? Four answers seem clear: \n \nFirst, we must avoid the protective, cloying, stop-consumption effects of\naftertaste that are a standard part of physiology, developed through\nDarwinian evolution to enhance the replication of man's genes by forcing a\ngenerally helpful moderation on the gene carrier. To serve our ends, on hot\n\f\ndays, a consumer must be able to drink container after container of our\nproduct with almost no impediment from aftertaste. We will find a\nwonderful no-aftertaste flavor by trial and error and will thereby solve this\nproblem. \n \nSecond, we must avoid ever losing even half of our powerful trademarked\nname. It will cost us mightily, for instance, if our sloppiness should ever\nallow sale of any other kind of \"cola,\" for instance, a \"peppy cola.\" If there\nis ever a \"peppy cola,\" we will be the proprietor of the brand. \n \nThird, with so much success coming, we must avoid bad effects from envy,\nwhich is given a prominent place in the Ten Commandments because envy\nis so much a part of human nature. The best way to avoid envy, recognized\nby Aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get. We will be fanatic\nabout product quality, quality of product presentation, and reasonableness\nof prices, considering the harmless pleasure we will provide. \n \nFourth, after our trademarked flavor dominates our new market, we must\navoid making any huge and sudden change in our flavor. Even if a new\nflavor performs better in blind taste tests, changing to that new flavor would\nbe a foolish thing to do. This follows because, under such conditions, our\nold flavor will be so entrenched in consumer preference by psychological\neffects that a big flavor change would do us little good. And it would do\nimmense harm by triggering in consumers the standard Deprival super-\nreaction syndrome that makes \"takeaways\" so hard to get in any type of\nnegotiation and helps make most gamblers so irrational. Moreover, such a\n\f\nlarge flavor change would allow a competitor, by copying our old flavor, to\ntake advantage of both (1) the hostile consumer super-reaction to Deprival\nand (2) the huge love of our original flavor created by our previous work. \n \nWell, that is my solution to my own problem of turning $2 million into $2\ntrillion even after paying out billions of dollars in dividends. I think it\nwould have won with Glotz in 1884 and should convince you more than\nyou expected at the outset. After all, the correct strategies are clear after\nbeing related to elementary academic ideas brought into play by the helpful\nnotions. \n \nHow consistent is my solution with the history of the real Coca-Cola\nCompany \n \nWell, as late as 1896, twelve years after the fictional Glotz was to start\nvigorously with two million 1884 dollars, the real Coca-Cola Company had\na net worth under $150,000 and earnings of about zero. And thereafter, the\nreal Coca-Cola Company did lose half its trademark and did grant perpetual\nbottling franchises at fixed syrup prices. And some of the bottlers were not\nvery effective and couldn't easily be changed. And the real Coca-Cola\nCompany, with this system, did lose much pricing control that would have\nimproved results, had it been retained. Yet, even so, the real Coca-Cola\nCompany followed so much of the plan given to Glotz that it is now worth\nabout $125 billion and will have to increase its value at only eight percent\nper year until 2034 to reach a value of $2 trillion. And it can hit an annual\nphysical volume target of 2.92 trillion servings if servings grow until 2034\n\f\nat only six percent per year, a result consistent with much past experience\nand leaving plenty of plain-water ingestion for Coca-Cola to replace after\n2034. So, I would guess that the fictional Glotz, starting earlier and stronger\nand avoiding the worst errors, would have easily hit his $2 trillion target.\nAnd he would have done it well before 2034. \n \nThis brings me, at last, to the main purpose of my talk. Large educational\nimplications exist, if my answer to Glotz's problem is roughly right and you\nmake one more assumption I believe true-that most Ph.D. educators, even\npsychology professors and business school deans, would not have given the\nsame simple answer I did. And, if I am right in these two ways, this would\nindicate that our civilization now keeps in place a great many educators\nwho can't satisfactorily explain Coca Cola, even in retrospect, and even\nafter watching it closely all their lives. This is not a satisfactory state of\naffairs. \n \nacademic psychology, while it is admirable and useful as a list of ingenious\nand important experiments, lacks intradisciplinary synthesis. \n \nMoreover-and this result is even more extreme-the brilliant and effective\nexecutives who, surrounded by business school and law school graduates,\nhave run the Coca-Cola Company with glorious success in recent years also\ndid not understand elementary psychology well enough to predict and avoid\nthe \"New Coke\" fiasco, which dangerously threatened their company. That\npeople so talented, surrounded by professional advisers from the best\n\f\nuniversities, should thus demonstrate a huge gap in their education is also\nnot a satisfactory state of affairs. \n \nSuch extreme ignorance, in both the high reaches of academia and the high\nreaches of business is a lollapalooza effect of a negative sort, demonstrating\ngrave defects in academia. Because the bad effect is a lollapalooza, we\nshould expect to find intertwined, multiple academic causes. I suspect at\nleast two such causes. \n \nFirst, academic psychology, while it is admirable and useful as a list of\ningenious and important experiments, lacks intradisciplinary synthesis. In\nparticular, not enough attention is given to lollapalooza effects coming from\ncombinations of psychological tendencies. This creates a situation\nreminding one of a rustic teacher who tries to simplify school work by\nrounding pi to an even three. And it violates Einstein's injunction that\n\"everything should be made as simple as possible but no more simple.\" In\ngeneral, psychology is laid out and misunderstood as electromagnetism\nwould now be misunderstood if physics had produced many brilliant\nexperimenters like Michael Faraday and no grand synthesizer like James\nClerk Maxwell \n \nacademic psychology departments are immensely more important and\nuseful than other academic departments think. And, at the same time, the\npsychology departments are immensely worse than most of their inhabitants\nthink. It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than\n\f\nexternal appraisal. Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your\nspeaker today. \n \nAnd, second, there is a truly horrible lack of synthesis blending psychology\nand other academic subjects. But only an interdisciplinary approach will\ncorrectly deal with reality-in academia as with the Coca-Cola Company. \n \nIn short, academic psychology departments are immensely more important\nand useful than other academic departments think. And, at the same time,\nthe psychology departments are immensely worse than most of their\ninhabitants think. It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more\npositive than external appraisal. Indeed, a problem of this sort may have\ngiven you your speaker today. But the size \nof this psychology-department gap is preposterously large. In fact, the gap\nis so enormous that one very eminent university (Chicago) simply abolished\nits psychology department, perhaps with an undisclosed hope of later\ncreating a better version. \n \nIn such a state of affairs, many years ago and with much that was plainly\nwrong already present, the \"New Coke\" fiasco occurred. Therein, Coke's\nexecutives came to the brink of destroying the most valuable trademark in\nthe world. The academically correct reaction to this immense and well-\npublicized fiasco would have been the sort of reaction Boeing would\ndisplay if three of its new airplanes crashed in a single week. After all,\nproduct integrity is involved in each case, and the plain educational failure\nwas immense.\n\f\nBut almost no such responsible, Boeing-like reaction has come from\nacademia. Instead, academia, by and large, continues in its balkanized way\nto tolerate psychology professors who misteach psychology, non\npsychology professors who fail to consider psychological effects obviously\ncrucial in their subject matter, and professional schools that carefully\npreserve psychological ignorance coming in with each entering class and\nare proud of their inadequacies. \n \nEven though this regrettable blindness and lassitude is now the normal\nacademic result, are there exceptions providing hope that disgraceful\nshortcomings of the education establishment will eventually be corrected?\nHere, my answer is a very optimistic yes. \n \nFor instance, consider the recent behavior of the economics department of\nthe university of Chicago. Over the last decade, this department has enjoyed\na near monopoly of the Nobel prizes in economics, largely by getting good\npredictions out of \"free market\" models postulating man's rationality. And\nwhat is the reaction of this department after winning so steadily with its\nrational-man approach? \n \nWell, it has just invited into a precious slot amid its company of greats a\nwise and witty Cornell economist, Richard Thaler. And it has done this\nbecause Thaler pokes fun at much that is holy at the University of Chicago.\nIndeed, Thaler believes, with me, that people are often massively irrational\n\f\nin ways predicted by psychology that must be taken into account in\nmicroeconomics. \n \nIn so behaving, the University of Chicago is imitating Darwin, who spent\nmuch of his long life thinking in reverse as he tried to disprove his own\nhardest-won and best-loved ideas. And so long as there are parts of\nacademia that keep alive its best values by thinking in reverse like Darwin,\nwe can confidently expect that silly educational practices will eventually be\nreplaced by better ones, exactly as Carl Jacobi might have predicted. \n \n309 \n \nThaler pokes fun at mucli that is holy at the University of Chicago. Indeed,\nThaler believes, with me, that people Are often massively irrational in ways\npredicted by psychology that must be taken into account \nIn to microeconomics, \n \nThis will happen because the Darwinian approach, with its habitual\nobjectivity taken on as a sort of hair shirt, is a mighty approach, indeed. No\nless a figure than Einstein said that one of the four causes of his\nachievement was self-criticism, ranking right up there alongside curiosity,\nconcentration, and perseverance. \n \nAnd, to further appreciate the power of self-criticism, consider where lies\nthe grave of that very \"ungifted\" undergraduate, Charles Darwin. It is in\nWestminster Abbey, right next to the headstone of Isaac Newton, perhaps\n\f\nthe most gifted student who ever lived, honored on that headstone in eight\nLatin words constituting the most eloquent praise in all graveyard print:\n\"Hie depositum est, quod mortale fuit Isaaci Newtoni\"-\"Here lies that which\nwas mortal of Isaac Newton.\" \n \nA civilization that so places a dead Darwin will eventually develop and\nintegrate psychology in a proper and practical fashion that greatly increases\nskills of all sorts. But all of us who have dollops of power and see the light\nshould help the process along. There is a lot at stake. If, in many high\nplaces, a universal product as successful as Coca-Cola is not properly\nunderstood and explained, it can't bode well for our competency in dealing\nwith much else that is important. \n \nAd that was a favorite of mine: \"The company that needs a new machine\ntool, and hasn't bought it, is already paying for it.\" \n \nOf course, those of you with fifty percent of net worth in Coca-Cola stock,\noccurring because you tried to so invest ten percent after thinking like I did\nin making my pitch to Glotz, can ignore my message about psychology as\ntoo elementary for useful transmission to you. But I am not so sure that this\nreaction is wise for the rest of you. The situation reminds me of the old-time\nWarner & Swasey ad that was a favorite of mine: \"The company that needs\na new machine tool, and hasn't bought it, is already paying for it.\" \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Four\n\f\nQuestion: \"Do you use a computer?\" \n \nAnswer: \"I don't. I do have one in my office, but I've never turned it on. In\nfact, I wouldn't even know how to plug it in. \n \nIn my life there are not many questions I can't properly deal with using my\n$40 adding machine and \ndog-eared compound interest table.\" \n \nTalk Four Revisited \n \nIn this talk I attempted to demonstrate large, correctable and important\ncognitive failure in U.S. academia and business. After all, I argued: \n \n(1) If academia and business functioned with best practicable results, most\ndenizens would be able to explain the success of the Coca-Cola Company\nthrough parsimonious use of basic concepts and problem-solving\ntechniques; yet \n \n(2) As the \"new Coke\" fiasco and its aftermath indicated, neither academia\nnor business had a respectable grasp of the simple realities causing the\nsuccess of Coca-Cola. \n \nAs matters worked out, my 1996 talk failed to get through to almost all\npeople hearing it. Then later, between 7996 and 2006, even when the talk's\nwritten version was slowly read twice by very intelligent people who"

Instead, people were puzzled briefly, then\nmoved on. \n \nThus my failure as a communicator was even more extreme than the\ncognitive failure I was trying to explain. Why? \n \nThe best explanation, I now think, is that I displayed gross folly as an\namateur teacher. I attempted too much. I have always avoided all people\nwho want to converse at length about the \"meaning of meaning.\" Yet I\nchose as my title, \"Practical Thought about Practical Thought?\" This was a\nstart into tough territory. Then I worked out a long, complex interplay of\nfive generalized, powerful problem solving tricks with basic ideas from a\ngreat many disciplines. I particularly included psychology, about which I\nwanted to demonstrate that there is much lamentable ignorance, even\namong highly educated people, some of whom teach psychology. My\ndemonstration, naturally, relied on correct psychology as part of my would\nbe demonstration. This was logically sound. But, if psychological ignorance\nis widespread, why would most of my hearers recognize that my version of\npsychology was correct? Thus, for most hearers, I did the rough equivalent\nof trying to explain some hard-to-comprehend ideas by simply defining\nthose ideas as equivalent to themselves. \n \nAnd this was not the outer limit of my teaching folly. After I knew that the\nwritten version of my talk was hard to understand, I consented to an order\n\f\nof talks in the first edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack For wherein my\npsychology talk was talk Ten, inserted many pages after talk Four. Instead, I\nshould have recognized that the order of the two talks should be reversed,\nconsidering that talk Four assumed that hearers had already mastered basic\npsychology, the subject of talk Ten. Then, finally, in the Second Edition of\nthe Almanac,I have preferred to maintain the original, unhelpful order of\nthe two talks. I did this because I like closing the book with my most recent\norganization of psychology into a sort of check-list that has long been\nhelpful to me. [Editor's note: Talk Ten is now talk Eleven in this edition. \n \nReaders of the Second and Third Edition, if they wish, can correct\nsomewhat for the teaching defects that I have stubbornly retained. That is,\nthey can re-read Talk Four after mastering the final talk.

Delivered in 1998 at the fiftieth\nreunion of his Harvard Law School class, this talk focuses on a hugely\ncomplicated issue-the narrowness of elite education-and segments it into\nelements whose solutions, when taken together, form a satisfactory answer\nto the problem.

If superior structures are known and\navailable, why don't educators more broadly utilize them? What could be\nmore simple?\" \n \nTalk Five \n \nThe Need for More Multidisciplinary\nSkills from Professionals: Educational\nImplications \nFiftieth Reunion of Harvard Law School Class of 1948 \nApril 24,1998 \n \nToday i am going to engage in a game reminding us of our old professors:\nSocratic solitaire. I will ask and briefly answer five questions:\n\f\n1) Do broadscale professionals need more multidisciplinary skill? \n2) Was our education sufficiently multidisciplinary? \n3) In elite broadscale soft science, what is the essential nature of practicable\nbest-form multidisciplinary education? \n4) In the last fifty years, how far has elite academia progressed \ntoward attainable best-form multidisciplinarity? \n5) What educational practices would make progress faster? \n \nWe start with the question: Do broadscale professionals need more\nmultidisciplinary skill? \n \nTo answer the first question, we must first decide whether more\nmultidisciplinarity will improve professional cognition. And, co decide\nwhat will cure bad cognition, it will help to know what causes it. One of\nBernard Shaw's characters explained professional defects as follows: \"In the\nlast analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.\" There is a\nlot of truth in Shaw's diagnosis, as was early demonstrated when in the\nsixteenth century, the dominant profession, the clergy, burned William\nTyndale at the stake for translating the Bible into English. \n \nWilliam Tyndale (1495_1536) \n \nWilliam Tyndale, born in Gloucestershire, England, earned a degree from\nOxford and became a priest. He found England hostile to his beliefs and\nspent time in Germany and Belgium, where he expanded his beliefs and\nspread the teachings of Martin Luther. His books having been burned, and\n\f\nhis having become a continuing target of hostility, he nonetheless continued\nto publish Bible translations and other tracts. After months of\nimprisonment, he was condemned for heresy, strangled to death, and\npublicly cremated. Later, Tyndale’s translation formed the basis of the first\nroyally approved English language Bible and had great impact on the\ndevelopment of the English language. \n \nBut Shaw plainly understates the problem in implying that a conscious, self\ninterested malevolence is the main culprit. More important, there are\nfrequent, terrible effects in professionals from intertwined subconscious\nmental tendencies, two of which are exceptionally prone to cause trouble: \n \n1) Incentive-caused bias, a natural cognitive drift toward the conclusion\nthat \nwhat is good for the professional is good for the client and the wider\ncivilization; and \n \n2) Man-with-a-hammer tendency, with the name taken from the proverb:\n\"To a man with only a hammer, every problem tends to look pretty much\nlike a nail.\" \n \nOne partial cure for man-with-a-hammer tendency is obvious: If a man has\na vast set of skills over multiple disciplines, he, by definition, carries\nmultiple tools and, therefore, will limit bad cognitive effects from man-\nwith-a-hammer tendency. Moreover when he is multidisciplinary enough to\nabsorb from practical psychology the idea that all his life he must fight bad\n\f\neffects from both the tendencies I mentioned, both within himself and from\nothers, he has taken a constructive step on the road to worldly wisdom. \n \nIf \"A\" is narrow Professional doctrine and \"8\" consists of the big, extra-\nuseful concepts from other disciplines, then, clearly, the professional\npossessing \"A\" plus \"B\" will usually be better off than the poor possessor of\n\"A\" alone. How could it be otherwise? And thus, the only rational excuse\nfor not acquiring more \"B\" is that it is not practical to do so, given the man's\nneed for \"A\" and the other urgent demands in his life. I will later try to\ndemonstrate that this excuse for interdisciplinarity, at least for our most\ngifted people, is usually unsound. \n \nBroadscale problems, by definition, cross many academic disciplines \n \nMy second question is so easy to answer that I won't give it much time. Our\neducation was far too unidisciplinary. Broadscale problems, by definition,\ncross many academic disciplines. Accordingly', using a unidisciplinary\nattack on such problems is like playing a bridge hand by counting trumps\nwhile ignoring all else. This is \"bonkers,\" sort of like the Mad Hatter's Tea\nParty. But, nonetheless, too much that is similar rcmains present in\nprofessional practice and, even worse, has long been encouraged in isolated\ndepartments of soft science, defined as everything less fundamental than\nbiology. \n \nEven in our youth, some of the best professors were horrified by bad effects\nfrom balkanization of academia into insular, turf-protecting enclaves where\n\f\nnotions were maintained by leaps of faith plus exclusion of non believers.\nAlfred North Whitehead, for one, long ago sounded an alarm in strong\nlanguage when he spoke of \"the fatal un connectedness of academic\ndisciplines.\" And, since then, elite educational institutions. agreeing more\nand more with Whitehead, have steadily fought un connectedness by\nbringing in more multidisciplinarity, causing some awesome plaudits to be\nwon in our time by great un Connectedness fighters at borders of academic\ndisciplines, for instance, Harvard's E. O. Wilson and Caltech's Linus\nPauling. \n \nModern academia now gives more multidisciplinarity than we received and\nis plainly right to do so. \n \nAlfred North 'Whitehead (1861_1947) \n\"Fools act on imagination without knowledge; pedants act on knowledge\nwithout imagination.\" \n \n\"True courage is not the brutal force of vulgar heroes, but the firm resolve\nof virtue and reason.\" \n \n\"Not ignorance, but ignorance of ignorance is the depth of knowledge.\" \n \n\"The Silly question is the first intimation of some totally new\ndevelopment.\" \n \n\"Civilizations can only be understood by those who are civilized.\""

    "raw_text": "\"No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of\nothers. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude.\" \n \n\"Almost all new ideas have a certain aspect of Foolishness when they are\nfirst produced.\" \n \nThe natural third question then becomes: What is now the goal? What is the\nessential nature of best-form multidisciplinarity in elite education? This\nquestion, too, is easy to answer. All we have to do is examine our most\nsuccessful narrow-scale education, identify essential elements, and scale up\nthose elements to reach the sensible solution. \n \nYes, I am suggesting today that mighty Harvard would do better f it thought\nmore about pilot training. \n \nTo find the best educational narrow-scale model, we have to look not at\nunthreatened schools of education and the like, too much driven by our two\ncounterproductive psychological tendencies and other bad influences, but,\ninstead, look where incentives for effective education are strongest and\nresults are most closely measured. This leads us to a logical place: the\nhugely successful education now mandatory for pilots. (Yes, I am\nsuggesting today that mighty Harvard would do better if it thought more\nabout pilot training.) In piloting, as in other professions, one great hazard is\nbad effect from man-with-a-hammer tendency. We don't want a pilot, ever,\nto respond to a hazard as if it was hazard \"X\" just because his mind contains\n\f\nonly a hazard \"X\" model. And so, for that and other reasons. we train a pilot\nin a strict six-element system: \n \n1) His formal education is wide enough to cover practically everything\nuseful in piloting. \n \n2) His knowledge of practically everything needed by pilots is not taught\njust well enough to enable him to pass one test or two; instead, all his\nknowledge is raised to practice-based fluency, even in handling two or three\nintertwined hazards at once. \n \n3) Like any good algebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward\nfashion and sometimes in reverse; and so he learns when to concentrate\nmostly on what he wants to happen and also when to concentrate mostly on\navoiding what he does not want to happen. \n \n4) His training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage\nfrom his later malfunctions; and so what is most important in his\nperformance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest\nfluency levels. \n \n5) \"Checklist\" routines are always mandatory for him. \n \n6) Even after original training, he is forced into a special knowledge\nmaintenance routine: regular use of the aircraft simulator to prevent atrophy\n\f\nthrough long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare and important\nproblems. \n \nWe need for best results to have multidisciplinary coverage of immense\namplitude, with all needed skills raised to an ever-maintained practice based\nfluency,. \n \nThe need for this clearly correct six-element system, with its large demands\nin a narrow-scale field where stakes are high, is rooted in the deep structure\nof the human mind. Therefore, we must expect that the education we need\nfor broadscale problem solving will keep all these elements but with\nawesomely expanded coverage for each element. How could it be\notherwise? \n \nThus it follows, as the night the day, that in our most elite broadscale\neducation wherein we are trying to make silk purses out of silk, we need for\nbest results to have multidisciplinary coverage of immense amplitude, with\nall needed skills raised to an ever-maintained practice-based fluency,\nincluding considerable power of synthesis at boundaries between\ndisciplines, with the highest fluency levels being achieved where they are\nmost needed, with forward and reverse thinking techniques being employed\nin a manner reminding one of inversion in algebra, and with \"checklist\"\nroutines being a permanent part of the knowledge system. There can be no\nother way, no easier way, to broadscale worldly wisdom. Thus the task,\nwhen first identified in its immense breadth, seems daunting, verging on\nimpossible.\n\f\nBut the task, considered in full context, is far from impossible when we\nconsider three factors: \n \nFirst, the concept of \"all needed skills\" lets us recognize that we don't have\nto raise everyone's skill in celestial mechanics to that of Laplace and also\nask everyone to achieve a similar skill level in all other knowledge. Instead,\nit turns out that the truly big ideas in each discipline, learned only in\nessence, carry most of the freight. And they are not so numerous, nor are\ntheir interactions so complex, that a large and multidisciplinary\nunderstanding is impossible for many, given large amounts of talent and\ntime. \n \nSecond, in elite education, we have available the large amounts of talent\nand time that we need. After all, we are educating the top one percent in\naptitude, using teachers who, on average, have more aptitude than the\nstudents. And we have roughly thirteen long years in which to turn our most\npromising twelve-year-olds into starting professionals. \n \nThird, thinking by inversion and through use of \"checklists\" is easily\nlearned in broadscale life as in piloting. \n \nMoreover, we can believe in the attainability of broad multidisciplinary skill\nfor the same reason the fellow from Arkansas gave for his belief in baptism:\n\"I've seen it done.\" We all know of individuals, modern Ben Franklin's, who\nhave (1) achieved a massive multidisciplinary synthesis with less time in"

    "raw_text": "formal education than is now available to our numerous brilliant young and\n(Z) thus become better performers in their own disciplines, not worse,\ndespite diversion of learning time to matter outside the normal coverage of\ntheir own disciplines. \n \nGiven the time and talent available and examples of successful masters of\nmultiple disciplines, what is shown by our present failure to minimize bad\neffects from man-with-a-hammer tendency is only that you can't win big in\nmultidisciplinarity in soft-science academia if you are so satisfied with the\nstatus quo, or so frightened by the difficulties of change, that you don't try\nhard enough to win big. \n \nWhich brings us to our fourth question: Judged with reference to an\noptimized feasible multidisciplinary goal, how much has elite soft-science\neducation been corrected after we left. \n \nThe answer is that many things have been tried as corrections in the\ndirection of better multidisciplinarity. And. after allowing for some\ncounterproductive results, there has been some considerable improvement,\nnet. But much desirable correction is still undone and lies far ahead. \n \nFor instance, soft science academia has increasingly found it helpful when\nprofessors from different disciplines collaborate or when a professor has\nbeen credentialed in more than one discipline. But a different sort of\ncorrection has usually worked best, namely augmentation, or \"take what\nyou wish\" practice that encourages any discipline to simply assimilate\n\f\nwhatever it chooses from other disciplines. Perhaps it has worked best\nbecause it bypassed academic squabbles rooted in the tradition and\nterritoriality that had caused the unidisciplinary folly for which correction\nwas now sought. \n \nIn his great work, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities, Laplace sets out\none of his signature ideas: \"We may regard the present state of the universe\nas the effect of its past and the cause. of its future, An intellect which at a\ncertain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all\npositions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also\nvast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single\nformula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of\nthe tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the\nfuture just like the past would be present before its eyes,\" \n \nEconomics, in turn, took in from a biologist the \"tragedy of the commons\"\nmodel, thus correctly finding a wicked \"invisible foot\" in coexistence with\nAdam Smith's angelic \"invisible hand.\" \n \nRoger Fisher (b. 1922) \nRoger Fisher earned a law degree from Harvard in 1948 and stayed on as a\nfaculty member in the Law School. He became director of the Harvard\nNegotiation Project in 1980. An expert in negotiation and conflict\nresolution, he co authored (with Bill Ury) Getting to YES, a classic text in\nwin-win negotiation techniques.\n\f\nIn any event, through increased use of \"take what you wish,\" many soft-\nscience disciplines reduced folly from man-with-a-hammer tendency. For\ninstance, led by our classmate Roger Fisher, the law schools brought in\nnegotiation, drawing on other disciplines. Over three million copies of\nRoger's wise and ethical negotiation book have now been sold, and his life's\nachievement may well be the best, ever, from our whole class. The law\nschools also brought in a lot of sound and useful economics, even some\ngood game theory to enlighten antitrust law by better explaining how\ncompetition really works. \n \nEconomics, in turn, took in from a biologist the \"tragedy of the commons\"\nmodel, thus correctly finding a wicked \"invisible foot\" in coexistence with\nAdam Smith's angelic \"invisible hand.\" These days, there is even some\n\"behavioral economics,\" wisely seeking aid from psychology. \n \nHowever, an extremely permissive practice like \"take what you wish\" was\nnot destined to have one-hundred percent-admirable results in soft science.\nIndeed, in some of its worst outcomes, it helped changes like ( 1)\nassimilation of Freudianism in some literature departments; (2) importation\ninto many places of extremist political ideologies of the left or right that\nhad, for their possessors, made regain of objectivity almost as unlikely as\nregain of virginity; and (3) importation into many law and business schools\nof hard-form, efficient-market theory by misguided would-be experts in\ncorporate finance, one of whom kept explaining Berkshire Hathaway's\ninvesting success by adding standard deviations of luck until, at six\n\f\nstandard deviations, he encountered enough derision to force a change in\nexplanation. \n \nMoreover, even when it avoided such lunacies, \"take what you wish\" had\nsome serious defects. For instance, takings from more fundamental\ndisciplines were often done without attribution, sometimes under new\nnames, with little attention given to rank in a fundamentalness order for\nabsorbed concepts. Such practices (1) act like a lousy filing system that\nmust impair successful use and synthesis of absorbed knowledge and (2) do\nnot maximize in soft science the equivalent of linus Pauling's systematic\nmining of physics to improve chemistry. There must be a better way. \n \nThis brings us, finally, to our last question: In elite soft science, what\npractices would hasten our progress toward optimized disciplinarity? Here\nagain, there are some easy answers: \n \nFirst, many more courses should be mandatory, not optional. And this, in\nturn, requires that the people who decide what is mandatory must possess\nlarge, multidisciplinary knowledge maintained in fluency. This conclusion\nis as obvious in the training of the would-be broadscale problem solver as it\nis in the training of the would-be pilot. For instance, both psychology\nmastery and accounting mastery should be required as outcomes in legal\neducation. Yet, in many elite places, even today, there are no such\nrequirements. Often, such is [he narrowness of mind of the program\ndesigners that they neither see what is needed and missing nor are able to\nfix deficiencies.\n\f\nSecond, there should be much more problem-solving practice that crosses\nseveral disciplines, including practice that mimics the function of the\naircraft simulator in preventing loss of skills through disuse. Let me give an\nexample, roughly remembered, of this sort of teaching by a very wise but\nuntypical Harvard Business School professor many decades ago. \n \nThis professor gave a test involving two unworldly old ladies who had just\ninherited a New England shoe factory making branded shoes and beset with\nserious business problems described in great detail. The professor then gave\nthe students ample time to answer with written advice to the old ladies. In\nresponse to the answers, the professor next gave every student an\nundesirable grade except for one student who was graded at the top by a\nwide margin. What was the winning answer? It was very short and roughly\nas follows: \"This business field and this particular business, in its particular\nlocation, present crucial problems that are so difficult that unworldly old\nladies can not wisely try to solve them through hired help. Given the\ndifficulties and unavoidable agency costs, the old ladies should promptly\nsell the shoe factory probably to the competitor who would enjoy the\ngreatest marginal utility advantage.\" Thus, the winning answer relied not on\nwhat the students had most recently been taught in business school but,\ninstead, on more fundamental concepts, like agency costs and marginal\nutility, lifted from undergraduate psychology and economics. \n \nAh, my fellow members of the Harvard Law Class of 1948: If only we had\nbeen much more often tested like that, just think of what more we might\n\f\nhave accomplished! \n \nIncidentally, many elite private schools now wisely use such\nmultidisciplinary methods in seventh grade science while, at the same time,\nmany graduate schools have not yet seen the same light. This is one more\nsad example of Whitehead's \"fatal un connectedness\" in education. \n \nThird, most soft-science professional schools should increase use of the best\nbusiness periodicals, like the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, etc. Such\nperiodicals are now quite good and perform the function of the aircraft\nsimulator if used to prompt practice in relating events to multidisciplinary\ncauses, often intertwined. And sometimes the periodicals even introduce\nnew models for causes instead of merely refreshing old knowledge. Also, it\nis not just slightly sound to have the student practice in school what he must\npractice lifelong after formal education is over if he is going to maximize\nhis good judgment. I know no person in business, respected for verified\ngood judgment, whose wisdom maintenance system does not include use of\nsuch periodicals. Why should academia be different? \n \nSuch periodicals are not quite good and perform the function of the aircraft\nsimulator if used to prompt practice in relating events to multidisciplinary\ncauses, often intertwined. \n \nFourth, in filling scarce academic vacancies, professors of super strong,\npassionate, political ideology, whether on the left or right, should usually be\navoided. So also for students. Best-form multidisciplinarity requires an\n\f\nobjectivity' such passionate people have lost, and a difficult synthesis is not\nlikely to be achieved by minds in ideological fetters. In our day, some\nHarvard Law professors could and did point to a wonderful example of just\nsuch ideology-based folly. This, of course, was the Law school at Yale,\nwhich was then viewed by many at Harvard as trying to improve legal\neducation by importing a particular political ideology as a dominant factor. \n \nFifth, soft science should more intensely imitate the fundamental organizing\nethos of hard science (defined as the \"fundamental four-discipline\ncombination\" of math, physics, chemistry, and engineering). This ethos\ndeserves more imitation. \n \nRichard P. Feynman (1918-1988) \n \nRichard Feynman was born in Far Rockaway, New York. He earned an\nundergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology and went on to Princeton for a PhD. He worked on the\nManhattan Project and was instrumental in the development of the atomic\nbomb. He held faculty posts at Cornell University until l95l and then seated\nat Caltech. Feynman's major contribution to physics was in quantum\nelectrodynamics, the study of the interactions of electromagnetic radiation\nwith atoms and more fundamental particles. He shared the Nobel Prize in\nphysics in 1965. \nLate in life, Feynman was named to the commission that investigated the\nChallenger Space Shuttle accident. He demonstrated the effect of cold"

    "raw_text": "3) You may never practice either cross-disciplinary absorption without\nattribution or departure from a \"principle of economy\" that forbids\nexplaining in any other way anything readily explainable from more\nfundamental material in your own or any other discipline. \n \n4) But when the step (3) approach doesn't produce much new and useful\ninsight, you should hypothesize and test to establishment new principles,\nordinarily by using methods similar to those that created successful old\nprinciples. But you may not use any new principle : inconsistent with an old\none unless you can now prove that the old principle is not true. \n \nThere is an old two-part rule that often works wonders in business, science,\nand elsewhere: (1) Take a simple, basic idea and (2) take it very seriously. \n \nYou will note that, compared with much current practice in soft science, the\nfundamental organizing ethos of hard science is more severe. This reminds\none of pilot training, and this outcome is not a coincidence. Reality is\ntalking to anyone who will listen. Like pilot training, the ethos of hard\nscience does not say \"take what you wish\" but \"learn it all to fluency, like it\nor not.\" And rational organization of multidisciplinary knowledge is forced\nby making mandatory (1) full attribution for cross-disciplinary takings and\n(?) mandatory preference for the most fundamental explanation. \n \nThis simple idea may appear too obvious to be useful, but there is an old\ntwo-part rule that often works wonders in business, science, and elsewhere:\n(1) Take a simple, basic idea and (2) take it very seriously. And, as some\n\f\nevidence for the value of taking very seriously the fundamental organizing\nethos, I offer the example of my own life. \n \nTo this day, I have never taken a course, anywhere, in chemistry,\neconomics, psychology, or business, \n \nI came to Harvard Law School very poorly educated, with desultory work\nhabits and no college degree. I was admitted over the objection of Warren\nAbner Seavey through the intervention of family friend Roscoe Pound. I\nhad taken one silly course in biology in high school, briefly learning,\nmostly by rote, an obviously incomplete theory of evolution, portions of the\nanatomy of the paramecium and frog, plus a ridiculous concept of\n\"protoplasm\" that has since disappeared. To this day, I have never taken any\ncourse, anywhere, in chemistry, economics, psychology, or business. But I\nearly took elementary physics and math and paid enough attention to\nsomehow assimilate the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science,\nwhich I thereafter pushed further and further into softer and softer fare as\nmy organizing guide and filing system in a search for whatever\nmultidisciplinary worldly wisdom it would be easy to get. \n \nThus, my life became a sort of accidental educational experiment with\nrespect to feasibility and utility of a very gross academic extension of the\nfundamental organizing ethos by a man who also learned well what his own\ndiscipline had to reach.\n\f\nWhat I found, in my extended attempts to complete by informal means my\nstunted education, was that, plugging along with only ordinary will but with\nthe fundamental organizing ethos as my guide, my ability to serve\neverything I loved was enhanced far beyond my deserts. Large gains came\nin places that seemed unlikely as I started out. sometimes making me like\nthe only one without the blindfold in a high-stake game of \"pin the tail on\nthe donkey.\" For instance, I  was productively led into psychology, where I\nhad no plans to go, creating large advantages that deserve a story On\nanother day. \n \nToday I have no more story I have finished my talk by answering my\nown questions as best as I could in a brief time what is most\ninteresting it to me in my answers is that comma while everything I\nhave said is not original and has long been obvious to the point of\nbanality too many sound and well educated mind, all the evils and I\ndecry remain grossly were present in the best of our soft science\neducational domains where in Virtually every professor has a too\nand disciplinary habit of mind, even while a better model exist just\nacross the ice in his own University to me, these ridiculous outcome\nimplies that the soft science departments tolerate perverse\nincentives wrong incentives are a major cause because as doctor\nJohnson so widely observed truth is hard to assimilate in any mind\nwhen opposed by interest and, if institutional incentives cost the\nproblem then the remedy is feasible because incentives can be\nchanged.\n\f\nA Notable Exception: One Professor who is Multidisciplinary \n \nJared Diamond was awarded the 1999 National Medal of Science by\nPresident Clinton for his breakthrough discoveries in evolutionary biology\nand for landmark research in applying Darwinian theory to such diverse\nfields as physiology and ecology. A physiologist by training and currently a\nprofessor of geography at UCLA., Diamond brilliantly synthesizes the great\nmodels of many different academic disciplines. To the left is the latest work\nof this Pulitzer Prize-winning author. (Collapse, how societies choose to fail\nor succeed) \n \nIt is neither inevitable nor advantages for soft science educational\ndomains to tolerate as much an in disciplinary wrong headedness as\nthey do now \n \nI have tried to demonstrate today, and indeed by the example of my\nlife, that It is neither inevitable nor advantages for soft science\neducational domains to tolerate as much an in disciplinary wrong\nheadedness as they do now. If I could somewhat fix there is an ethos\nalso from Dr. Johnson, that is applicable. Please remember the word Dr.\nJohnson used to describe maintenance of academic ignorance that is\nremovable through diligence. To Dr. Johnson, such conduct was\n\"treachery.\" \n \nAs Dr. Johnson so wisely observed, truth is hard to assimilate in any mind\nwhen opposed by interest. And, if institutional incentives cause the\n\f\nproblem, then a remedy is feasible-because incentives can be changed. \n \nAnd if duty will not move improvement, advantage is also available. There\nwill be immense worldly rewards, for law schools and other academic\ndomains as for Charlie Munger, in a more multidisciplinary approach to\nmany problems, common or uncommon. And more fun as well as more\naccomplishment. The happier mental realm I recommend is one from which\nno one willingly returns. A return would be like cutting off one's hands. \n \nTalk Five Revisited \n \nAs I review Talk Five in 2006, I would not change a word. And I continue\nto believe that my ideas are important. In my attitude I may be displaying\ntoo much similarity to my long-dead relative, Reverend Theodore Munger,\nformer chaplain of Yale. \n \nTheodore published a collection of his sermons, laying out proper conduct\nwith a strong, excathedra tone. Then, later in life,he published a final\nedition,reporting in his foreword that he had made no changes at all and\nwas now producing the new edition only because the extreme popularity of\nhis sermons had caused excessive wear in the original printing plates. \n \n“Read over your compositions, and when you meet a Passage which you\nthink is particularly fine, strike it out.\" \n-Samuel Johnson"

Referring back to his days as a\nlimited partnership manager, Charlie employs, as is typical, self-deprecation\nand self-reflection: \"Early Charlie Munger is a horrible career model for the\nyoung.\" If Charlie can emerge from that state successfully, he seems to be\nsaying, so can the wayward foundation managers in his audience. \n \nTalk Six \n \nInvestment Practices of Leading\nCharitable Foundations \n \nSpeech to the Foundation Financial Officers Group at Miramar Sheraton\nHotel, Santa Monica, California, October 14,1998, sponsored by the Conrad\nHilton Foundation, the Amateur Athletic Foundation, the J. Paul Getty trust,\nand Rio Honda Memorial Foundation. \n \nI am speaking here today because my friend, John Argue, asked me. And\nJohn well knew that I, u,ho, unlike many other speakers on your agenda,\nhaving nothing to sell any of you, would be irreverent about much current\ninvestment practice in large institutions, including charitable foundations.\nTherefore any hostility my talk will cause should be directed at John Argue,\nwho comes from the legal profession and may even enjoy it.\n\f\nIt was long the norm at large charitable foundations to invest mostly in\nunleveraged, marketable, domestic securities, mostly equities. The equities\nwere selected by one or a very few investment counseling organizations.\nBut, in recent years, there has been a drift toward more complexity. Some\nfoundations, following the lead of institutions like Yale, have tried to\nbecome much better versions of Bernie Cornfeld \"fund of funds.\" This is\namazing development. Few would have predicted that long after Cornfeld's\nfall into disgrace, major universities would be leading foundations into\nCornfeld's system. \n \nNow, in some foundations, there are not few but many investment\ncounselors, chosen by an additional layer of consultants who are hired to\ndecide which investment counselors are best, help in allocating funds to\nvarious categories, make sure that foreign securities are not neglected in\nfavor of domestic securities, check validity of claimed investment records,\nensure that claimed investment styles are scrupulously followed, and help\naugment an already large diversification in a way that conforms to the latest\nnotions of corporate finance professors about volatility and \"beta.\" \n \nFew would have predicted that long after Cornfeld's fall into disgrace,\nmajor universities would be leading foundations into Cornfeld's system. \n \nBernie Cornfeld, born in Turkey, came to America and became a mutual\nfund salesman in the 1950s. In the 1960s, he started selling his own family\nof mutual funds, Investors Overseas Services (IOS), incorporated in\nSwitzerland. He hired thousands of salespeople, who sold the funds door to-\n\f\ndoor all over Europe, especially in Germany. IOS raised $2.5 billion while\nCornfeld engaged in lavish personal consumPtion. \n \nBut even with this amazingly active, would-be-polymathic, new layer of\nconsultant-choosing consultants, the individual investment counselors, in\npicking common stocks, still rely to a considerable extent on a third layer of\nconsultants. The third layer consists of the security analysts employed by\ninvestment banks. These security analysts receive enormous salaries,\nsometimes set in seven figures after bidding wars. The hiring investment\nbanks recoup these salaries from two sources: (1) commissions and trading\nspreads borne by security buyers (some of which are rebated as \"soft\ndollars\" to money managers) plus (2) investment banking charges paid by\ncorporations that appreciate the enthusiastic way their securities are being\nrecommended by the security analysts. \n \nThis full cost doesn't show up in conventional accounting. But that is\nbecause accounting has limitations and not because the full cost isn't\npresent. \n \nThere is one thing sure about all this complexity, including its touches of\nbehavior lacking the full punctilio of honor. Even when nothing but\nunleveraged stock picking is involved, the total cost of all the investment\nmanagement, plus the frictional costs of fairly often getting in and out of\nmany large investment positions, can easily reach three percent of\nfoundation net worth per annum if foundations, urged on by consultants,\nadd new activity, year after year. This full cost doesn't show up in\n\f\nconventional accounting. But that is because accounting has limitations and\nnot because the full cost isn't present. \n \nNext, we come to time for a little arithmetic: It is one thing each year to pay\nthe croupiers three percent of starting wealth when the average foundation\nis enjoying a real return, say, of seventeen percent before the croupiers'\ntake. But it is not written in the stars that foundations will always gain\nseventeen percent gross, a common result in recent years. And if the\naverage annual gross real return from indexed investment in equities goes\nback, say, to five percent over some long future period, and the croupiers'\ntake turns out to remain the waste it has always been, even for the average\nintelligent player, then the average intelligent foundation will be in a\nprolonged, uncomfortable, shrinking mode. After all, five percent minus\nthree percent minus five percent in donations leaves an annual shrinkage of\nthree percent. \n \nAll the equity investors, in total, will surely bear a performance\ndisadvantage per annum equal to the total croupiers' costs they have jointly\nelected to bear. This is an inescapable fact of life. And it is also inescapable\nthat exactly half of the investors will get a result below the median result\nafter the croupiers' take, which median result may well be somewhere\nbetween unexciting and lousy \n \nThe croupiers' take turns out to remain the waste it has always been, even\nfor the average intelligent player.\n\f\nHuman nature being what it is, most people assume away worries like those\nI raise. After all, centuries before Christ, Demosthenes noted, \"what a man\nwishes, he will believe.\" And in self-appraisals of prospects and talents, it is\nthe norm, as Demosthenes predicted, for people to be ridiculously over-\noptimistic. For instance, a careful survey in Sweden showed that ninety\npercent of automobile drivers considered themselves above average. And\npeople who are successfully selling something, as investment counselors\ndo, make Swedish drivers sound like depressives. Virtually every\ninvestment expert's public assessment is that he is above average, no matter\nwhat is the evidence to the contrary. \n \nBut, you may think, my foundation, at least, will be above average. It is\nwell endowed, hires the best, and considers all investment issues at length\nand with objective professionalism. And to this I respond that an excess of\nwhat seems like professionalism will often hurt you horribly-precisely\nbecause the careful procedures themselves often lead to overconfidence in\ntheir outcome. \n \nA careful survey in Sweden shouted that ninety percent of automobile\ndrivers considered themselves above average. And people who Are\nsuccessfully selling something, as investment counselors do, make Swedish\ndrivers sound like depressives. \n \nGeneral Motors recently made just such a mistake, and it was a\nlollapalooza. Using fancy consumer surveys, its excess of professionalism,\nit concluded not to put a fourth floor in a truck designed to serve also as the\n\f\nequivalent of a comfortable five-passenger car. Its competitors, more basic,\nhad actually seen five people enter and exit cars. Moreover, they had\nnoticed that people were used to four doors in a comfortable five-passenger\ncar and that biological creatures ordinarily prefer effort minimization in\nroutine activities and don't like removals of long-enjoyed benefits. There\nare only two words that come instantly to mind in reviewing General\nMotors' horrible decision, which has blown many hundreds of millions of\ndollars. And one of those words is \"oops.\" \n \nBiological creatures ordinarily prefer effort minimization in routine\nactivities and don't like removal of long-enjoyed benefits. \n \nSimilarly, the hedge fund known as \"Long-Term Capital Management\"\nrecently collapsed through overconfidence in its highly leveraged methods,\ndespite I.Q.'s of its principles that must have averaged 160. Smart,\nhardworking people aren't exempted from professional disasters from\noverconfidence. Often, they just go aground in the more difficult voyages\nthey choose, relying on their self-appraisals that they have superior talents\nand methods. \n \nIt is, of course, irritating that extra care in thinking is not all good but also\nintroduces extra error. But most good things have undesired \"side effects,\"\nand thinking is no exception. The best defense is that of the best physicists,\nwho systematically criticize themselves to an extreme degree, using a\nmindset described by Nobel laureate Richard Feynman as follows: \"The"

The seminal book\non the subject, When Genius Failed was translated into many languages. \n \nBut suppose that an abnormally realistic foundation, thinking like Feynman,\nfears a poor future investment outcome because it is unwilling to assume\nthat it's unleveraged equities will outperform equity indexes, minus all\ninvestment costs, merely because the foundation has adopted the approach\nof becoming a \"fund of funds,\" with much investment turnover and layers\nof consultants that consider themselves above average. What are this fearful\nfoundation's options as it seeks \nimproved prospects?\n\f\nThere are at least three modern choices: \n \n1. The foundation can both dispense with its consultants and reduce its\ninvestment turnover as it changes to indexed investment in equities' \n \n2. The foundation can follow the example of Berkshire Hathaway, and thus\nget total annual croupier costs below one-tenth of one percent of principal\nper annum, by investing with virtually total passivity in a very few much-\nadmired domestic corporations. And there is no reason why some outside\nadvice can't be used in this process. All the fee payer has to do is suitably\ncontrol the high talent in investment counseling organizations so that the\nservant becomes the useful tool of its master, instead of serving itself under\nthe perverse incentives of a sort of Mad Hatter's Tea Party. \n \n3. The foundation can supplement unleveraged investment in marketable\nequities with investment in limited partnerships that do some combination\nof the following: unleveraged investment in high-tech corporations in their\ninfancy; leveraged investments in corporate buyouts; leveraged relative\nvalue trades in equities; and leveraged convergence trades and other exotic\ntrades in all kinds of securities and derivatives. \n \nFor the obvious reasons given by purveyors of indexed equities, I think\nchoice (1), indexing, is a wiser choice for the average foundation than what\nit is now doing in unleveraged equity investment. And particularly so, as its\npresent total croupier costs exceed one percent of principal per annum.\n\f\nIndexing can't work well forever if almost everybody turns to it. But it will\nwork all right for a long time. \n \nChoice (3), investment in fancy limited partnerships, is largely beyond the\nscope of this talk. I will only say that the Munger Foundation does nor so\ninvest and briefly mention two considerations bearing on LBO funds. \n \nThe first consideration bearing on LBO funds is that buying one hundred\npercent of corporations with much financial leverage and two layers of\npromotional carry (one for the management and one for the general partners\nin the LBO fund) is no sure thing to outperform equity indexes in the future\nif equity indexes perform poorly in the future. In substance, an LBO fund is\na better way of buying equivalents of marketable equities on margin, and\nthe debt could prove disastrous if future marketable equity performance is\nbad. And particularly so, if the bad performance comes from generally bad\nbusiness conditions. \n \nAnd there are now very many LBO funds, both large and small, mostly\nawash in money and with general partners highly incentivized to buy\nsomething \n \nThe second consideration is increasing competition for LBO candidates.\nFor instance, if the LBO candidates are good service corporations, General\nElectric can now buy more than $10 billion worth per year in GE's credit\ncorporation, with one hundred percent debt financing at an interest rate only\nslightly higher than the U.S. government is paying. This sort of thing is not\n\f\nordinary competition, but super competition. And there are now very many\nLBO funds, both large and small, mostly awash in money and with general\npartners highly incentivized to buy something. In addition, there is\nincreased buying competition from corporations other than GE using some\ncombination of debt and equity. \n \nIn short, in the LBO field, there is a buried covariance with marketable\nequities-toward disaster in generally bad business conditions-and\ncompetition is now extreme. \n \nGiven time limitations, I can say no more about limited partnerships, one of\nwhich I once ran. This leaves for extensive discussion only foundation\nchoice (2), more imitation of the investment practices of Berkshire\nHathaway in maintaining marketable equity portfolios with virtually zero\nturnover and with only a very few stocks chosen. This brings us to the\nquestion of how much investment \ndiversification is desirable at foundations. \n \nI have more than skepticism regarding the orthodox view that huge\ndiversification is a must for those wise enough so that indexation is not the\nlogical mode for equity investment. I think the \northodox view is grossly mistaken. \n \nIn the United States, a person or institution with almost all wealth invested\nlong-term, in just three fine domestic corporations, is securely rich. And\nwhy should such an owner care if, at any time, most other investors are"

And I reply: There are worse things than some foundation's losing\nrelative clout in the world, and rich institutions, like rich individuals, should\ndo a lot of self-insurance if they want to maximize long-term results. \n \nPeter E Drucker (1909-2005) \nPeter Drucker, born in Austria, was educated there and in England. He\nearned a PhD. in public and international law while working as a newspaper\nreporter in Germany. Later, he worked as an economist in a london bank\nand came to the United States in 1937 . His academic career has included\nprofessorships at Bennington College, New York University and, starting in\n1971, Claremont Graduate University, where the graduate management\nschool is named after him. For decades, he consulted for businesses and\nnonprofit organizations, \n \nAuthor of some thirty books on management, philosophy, and other topics,\nDrucker is considered a seminal thinker, writer, and lecturer on the\ncontemporary organization. In 2002, he received the Presidential Medal of\nFreedom. \n \nSome important factor does not lose share of force just because some\n'expert\" can better measure other types of force. \n \nFurthermore, all the good in the world is not done by foundation donations.\nMuch more good is done through the ordinary business operations of the\n\f\ncorporations in which the foundations invest. And some corporations do\nmuch more good than others do in a way that gives investors therein better-\nthan-average long term prospects. And I don't consider it foolish, stupid,\nevil, or illegal for a foundation to greatly concentrate investment in what it\nadmires or even loves. Indeed, Ben Franklin required just such an\ninvestment practice for the charitable endowment created by his will. \n \nOne other aspect of Berkshire's equity investment practice deserves\ncomparative mention. So fa1 there has been almost no direct foreign\ninvestment at Berkshire and much foreign investment at foundations. \n \nRegarding this divergent history I wish to say that I agree with Peter\nDrucker that the culture and legal systems of the United States are\nespecially favorable to shareholder interests compared to other interests and\ncompared to most other countries. Indeed, there are many other countries\nwhere any good going to public shareholders has a very low priority and\nalmost every other constituency stands higher in line. This factor, I think, is\nunderweighted at many investment institutions, probably because it does\nnot easily lead to quantitative thinking using modern financial technique.\nBur some important factor doesn't lose share of force just because some\n\"expert\" can better measure other types of force. Generally, I tend to prefer\nover direct foreign investment Berkshire's practice of participating in\nforeign economies through the likes of Coca-Cola and Gillette. \n \nI tend to prefer over direct foreign instrument Berkshire's practice of\nparticipating in foreign economies through the lives of Coca-Cola and\n\f\nGillette. \n \nTo conclude, I will make one controversial prediction and one controversial\nargument. \n \nThe controversial prediction is that, if some of you make your investment\nstyle more like Berkshire Hathaway's, in a long-term retrospect, you will be\nunlikely to have cause for regret, even if you can'[ get Warren Buffett to\nwork for nothing. Instead, Berkshire will have cause for regret as it faces\nmore intelligent investment competition. But Berkshire won't actually regret\nany disadvantage from your enlightenment. We only want what success we\ncan get despite encouraging others to share our general views about reality. \n \nMy controversial argument is an additional consideration weighing against\nthe complex, high-cost investment modalities becoming ever more popular\nat foundations. Even if, contrary to my suspicions, such modalities should\nturn out to work pretty well, most of the money-making activity would\ncontain profoundly antisocial effects. This would be so because the activity\nwould exacerbate the current, harmful trend in whichever more of the\nnations ethical young brainpower is attracted into lucrative money\nmanagement and its attendant modern frictions, as distinguished from work\nproviding much more value to others. Money management does not create\nthe right examples. Early Charlie Munger is a horrible career model for the\nyoung because not enough was delivered to civilization in return for what\nwas wrested from capitalism. And other similar career models are even\nworse.\n\f\nMoney management does not create the right examples. Early Charlie\nMunger is a horrible cAreer model for the young because not enough was\ndelivered to civilization in return for what was wrested, from capitalism. \n \nRather than encourage such models, a more constructive choice at\nfoundations is long-term investment concentration in a few domestic\ncorporations that are wisely admired. \nWhy not thus imitate Ben Franklin After all, old Ben was very effective in\ndoing public Good. And  he was a pretty good investor, too. Better his\nmodel, I think, than Bernie Cornfeld's. The choice is plainly yours to make. \n \nTalk Six Revisited \n \nA Lot of water has passed under the bridge since this talk was made in\n1998. And what has happened by 2006 is that we now see much more of the\nconduct I criticized. \n \nIn particular, frictional costs for stock market investors have increased\nmarkedly, and there has been an increase in the share of young brainpower\nbecoming, with respect to investments, what the tout is with respect to\nhorse racing tracks. \n \nIndeed, I recently heard Warren Buffett say that if present investment trends\nspread to racetracks, most bettors will try to improve results by always\nbringing along a well-paid personal tout.\n\f\nHowever, at the same time that lovers of frictional costs have been spending\nmore on what they love, there has also been an increase in holdings of\nstocks that track market indexes in a manner imposing negligible costs.\nThis cost-averse, index-mimicking group does not grow fast enough to\nprevent an increase in total frictional costs, but more stockholding is slowly\nbeing converted to the passive, indexed mode. \n \n351 \n \nHandicapping Is Investing, Investing Is Handicapping \n \nCharlie likes to cite similarities between the pari-mutuel betting system\nused at horse races and the stock market (see pages 196 and 197). Further,\nhe compares the best investing opportunities to mispriced bets on horses,\nsaying, \"What we're really looking for are 50-50 odds which pay three to\none\" (see page 64). \nEqually attuned to race track analogies is Warren Buffett. Intrigued as a boy\nby the voluminous data involving variables such as weights, speed ratings,\npace, past performance, and breeding, Buffett developed a keen interest in\nhorse racing. Along with a friend, he formed a partnership to produce a\ntipsheet, Stable Boy Selections, which was then sold at Omaha's Ak-Sar-\nBen race track (\"Nebraska\" spelled backwards). \n \nBuffett's early days as a horse handicapper may continue to benefit him\ntoday as an investor. In both arenas, voluminous data, variables and\n\f\nunknowns exist, together with different schools of thought as to how such\nfactors should best be evaluated. Not surprisingly, Buffett applies a similar\nmethodology to both pursuits. \n \nBack on the subject of handicapping, there are two schools to which\nmost practitioners belong speed and trip. much like the momentum\ninvestor in the stock market, the speed handicapper likes to get\nhorses that win races in fast times don't we all? The trip handicapper\nis more concerned with the nuances of the trip the horse had. \nDid the track favour closer that day? was the horse hindered? was\nthere a lot of speed in the race, no Speed? the legendary stock\nmarket investor Warren Buffett, began his adult life publishing a\nracetrack date sheet he was defined is in western style by calling\nhimself a trip handicapped few of his followers likely comprehended\nhis remark race trackers certainly did. \n \nAdded to the credibility of the above view by rice debry journal id the\nfact that its predicted winner of the 1993 Kentucky Derby, sea Hero\nindeed won paying a hefty $27.80 for those astute enough to place a\n2 dollar bet. \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Five \n \nWe continue with this question on the subject of performing arts: \n \nQuestion: \"Do you play the piano?\""

Startling Charlie's family and friends, Jody Curtis,\nof Foundation & Commentary, characterized Charlie as \"a friendly old\nuncle, one with a jolly sense of humor at that.\" \n \nCharlie's goal, as was the case in the previous speech, was to save\nfoundations from their own mistakes by getting them to invest effectively,\nwith minimum waste. Charlie warns foundations that they often act\nunwisely because of \"a failure to understand their own investment\noperations, related to the larger system\" of which they're a part. Never one\nto pull punches, he boldly and bluntly challenges his listeners to cure the\nignorance that is jeopardizing their foundations and those who depend on\nthem. Charlie coins the term \"febezzlement\"-the functional equivalent of\nembezzlement-to explain how wealth is stripped away by layers of\nunnecessary investment managers and consultants \n \nTalk Seven \nPhilanthropy Roundtable\n \nBreakfast Meeting of the Philanthropy Roundtable November 10,2000 \n \nI am here today to talk about so-called \"wealth effects\" from rising prices\nfor U.S. common stocks.\n\f\nI should concede, at the outset, that \"wealth effects\" are part of the\nacademic discipline of economics and that I have never taken a single\ncourse in economics, nor tried to make a single dollar, ever, from foreseeing\nmacroeconomic changes. \n \nNonetheless, I have concluded that most Ph.D. economists under appraise\nthe power of the common-stock-based \"wealth effect,\" under current\nextreme conditions. \n \nEveryone now agrees on two things. First, spending proclivity is influenced\nin an upward direction when stock prices go up and in a downward\ndirection when stock prices go down. And, second, the proclivity to spend\nis terribly important in macroeconomics. However, the professionals\ndisagree about size and timing of \"wealth effects,\" and how they interact\nwith other effects, including the obvious complication that increased\nspending tends to drive up stock prices while stock prices are concurrently\ndriving up spending. Also, of course, rising stock prices increase corporate\nearnings even when spending is static, for instance, by reducing pension\ncost accruals after which stock prices tend to rise more. Thus, \"wealth\neffects\" involve mathematical puzzles that are not nearly so well worked\nout as physics theories and never can be. \n \nI have never taken a single course in economics, nor tried to make a single\ndollar from foreseeing macro economic changes\n\f\nThe \"wealth effect\" from rising U.S. stock prices is particularly interesting\nright now for two reasons. First, there has never been an advance so\nextreme in the price of widespread stock holdings and, with stock prices\ngoing up so much faster than GNP, the related \"wealth effect\" must now be\nbigger than was common before. And second, what has happened in Japan\nover roughly the last ten years has shaken up academic economics, as it\nobviously should, creating strong worries about recession from \"wealth\neffects\" in reverse. \n \nIn Japan, with much financial corruption, there was an extreme rise in stock\nand real estate prices for a very long time, accompanied by extreme real\neconomic growth, compared to the United States. Then, asset values\ncrashed, and the Japanese economy stalled out at a very suboptimal level.\nAfter this, Japan, a modern economy that had learned all the wouldbe-\ncorrective Keynesian and monetary tricks, pushed these tricks hard and\nlong. Japan, for many years, not only ran an immense government deficit\nbut also reduced interest rates to a place within hailing distance of zero and\nkept them there. Nonetheless, the Japanese economy, year after year, stays\nstalled, as Japanese proclivity to spend stubbornly resists all the tricks of the\neconomists. And Japanese stock prices stay down. This Japanese experience\nis a disturbing example for everyone and, if something like it happened\nhere, would leave shrunken charitable foundations feeling clobbered by\nfate. Let us hope, as is probably the case, that the sad situation in Japan is\ncaused in some large part by social psychological effects and corruption\npeculiar to Japan. In such case, our country may be at least half as safe as is\nwidely assumed.\n\f\n\"Wealth effects\" involve mathematical puzzles that Are not nearly so well\nworked out as physics theories and never cAn be. \n \nWell, grant that spending proclivity, as influenced by stock prices, is now an\nimportant subject and that the long Japanese recession is disturbing. How\nbig are the economic influences of U.S. stock prices? A median conclusion\nof the economics professionals, based mostly on data collected by the\nFederal Reserve System, would probably be that the \"wealth effect\" on\nspending from stock prices is not all that big. After all, even now, real\nhousehold net worth, excluding pensions, is probably up by less than one\nhundred percent over the last ten years and remains a pretty modest figure\nper household, while market value of common stock is probably not yet\none-third of aggregate household net worth, excluding pensions. Moreover,\nsuch household wealth in common stocks is almost incredibly concentrated.\nand the super-rich don't consume in proportion to their wealth. Leaving out\npensions, the top one percent of households probably hold about fifty\npercent of common stock value, and the bottom eighty percent probably\nhold about four percent.. \n \nBased on such data plus unexciting past correlation between stock prices\nand spending, it is easy for a professional economist to conclude, say, that\neven if the average household spends incrementally at a rate of three\npercent of asset values in stock, consumer spending would have risen less\nthan one-half percent per year over the last ten years as a consequence of\nthe huge, unprecedented, long-lasting, consistent boom in stock prices."

    "raw_text": "I believe that such economic thinking widely misses underlying reality right\nnow. To me, such thinking looks at the wrong numbers and asks the wrong\nquestions. Let me, the ultimate amateur, boldly try to do a little better, or at\nleast a little differently. \n \nJohn Kenneth Galbraith (b. 1908) \nJohn Kenneth Galbraith, born in Ontario, Canada, graduated from Ontario\nAgricultural College and went on for a Ph. D. from the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley. In l949,he joined the economics faculty at Harvard\nUniversity. A friend of President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith served as U.S.\nambassador to India from l96l to 1963. \nAs an economist, Galbraith holds progressive values and writes accessible\nbooks that often describe how economic theory does not always mesh with\nreal life. Among his best known works are American Capitalism: The\nConcept of Countervailing Power (1952), The Affluent Society (1958), and\nThe New Industrial State (1967). \n \nFor one thing, I have been told, probably correctly, that Federal Reserve\ndata collection. due to practical obstacles, doesn't properly take into account\npension effects, including effects from 401(k) and similar plans. Assume\nsome sixty three-year-old dentist has $1 million in GE stock in a private\npension plan. The stock goes up in value to $2 million, and the dentist,\nfeeling flush, trades in his very old Chevrolet and leases a new Cadillac at\nthe giveaway rate now common. To me, this is an obvious large \"wealth\neffect\" in the dentist's spending. To many economists, using Federal\nReserve data, I suspect the occasion looks like profligate dissaving by the\n\f\ndentist. To me, the dentist, and many others like him, seems to be spending\na lot more because of a very strong pension-related \"wealth effect.\"\nAccordingly, I believe that present-day \"wealth effect\" from pension plans\nis far from trivial and much larger than it was in the past. \n \nFor another thing, the traditional thinking of economists often does not take\ninto account implications from the idea of \"bezzle.\" Let me repeat:\n\"bezzle,\" \nB-E-Z-Z-L-E. \n \nThe word \"bezzle\" is a contraction of the word \"embezzle,\" and it was\ncoined by Harvard Economics Professor John Kenneth Galbraith to stand\nfor the increase in any period of undisclosed embezzlement. Galbraith\ncoined the \"bezzle\" word because he saw that undisclosed embezzlement,\nper dollar, has a very powerful stimulating effect on spending. After all, the\nembezzler spends more because he has more income, and his employer\nspends as before because he doesn't know any of his assets are gone. \n \nBut Galbraith did not push his insight on. He was content to stop with being\na stimulating gadfly. So, I will now try to push Galbraith's \"bezzle\" concept\nonto the next logical level. As Keynes showed, in a native economy relying\non earned income, when the seamstress sells a coat to the shoemaker for\ntwenty dollars, the shoemaker has twenty dollars less to spend, and the\nseamstress has twenty dollars more to spend. There is no lollapalooza effect\non aggregate spending. But when the government prints another twenty\ndollar bill and use s it to buy a pair of shoes, the shoemaker has another\n\f\ntwenty dollars, and no one feels poorer. And when the shoemaker next buys\na coat, the process goes on and on, not to an infinite increase, but with what\nis now called the Keynesian multiplier effect, a sort of lollapalooza effect\non spending. Similarly, an undisclosed embezzlement has stronger\nstimulative effects per dollar on spending than a same-sized honest\nexchange of goods. Galbraith, being Scottish, liked the bleakness of life\ndemonstrated by his insight. After all, the Scottish enthusiastically accepted\nthe idea of preordained, unfixable infant damnation. But the rest of us don't\nlike Galbraith's insight. Nevertheless, we have to recognize that Galbraith\nwas roughly right. \n \nUndisclosed embezzlement, per dollar has a very powerful stimulating\neffect on spending. After all, the embezzler spends more because he has\nmore income, and his employer spends more because he doesn't know any\nof his assets are gone. \n \nNo doubt Galbraith saw the Keynesian-multiplier-type economic effect\npromised by increases in \"bezzle.\" But he stopped there. After all, \"bezzle\"\ncould not grow very big because discovery of massive theft was nearly\ninevitable and sure to have reverse effects in due course. Thus, increase in\nprivate \"bezzle\" could not drive economies up and up, and on and on, at\nleast for a considerable time, like government spending \n \nDeterred by the apparent smallness of economic effects from his insight,\nGalbraith did not ask the next logical question: Are there important\nfunctional equivalents of \"bezzle\" that are large and not promptly self-\n\f\ndestructive? My answer to this question is yes. I will next describe only\none. I will join Galbraith in coining new words: first, \"febezzle,\" to stand\nfor the functional equivalent of \"bezzle\"; second, \"febezzlement,\" to\ndescribe the process of creating \"febezzle\"; and third, \"febezzlers,\" to\ndescribe persons engaged in \"febezzlement.\" Then, I will identify an\nimportant source of \"febezzle\" right in this room. You people, I think, have\ncreated a lot of \"febezzle\" through your foolish investment management\npractices in dealing with your large holdings of common stock. \n \nIf a foundation, or other investor, wastes three percent of assets per year in\nunnecessary, nonproductive investment costs in managing a strongly rising\nstock portfolio, it still feels richer, despite the waste, while the people\ngetting the wasted three percent, \"febezzlers\" though they are, think they\nare virtuously earning income. The situation is functioning like undisclosed\nembezzlement without being self-limited. Indeed, the process can expand\nfor a long while by feeding on itself. And, all the while, what looks like\nspending from earned income of the receivers of the wasted three percent is,\nin substance, spending from a disguised \"wealth effect\" from rising stock\nprices. \n \nIt is paradoxical and disturbing to us that economists have long praised\nfoolish spending as a necessary ingredient of a successful economy!. \n \nThis room contains many people pretty well stricken by expired years-in\nmy generation or the one following. We tend to believe in thrift and\navoiding waste as good things, a process that has worked well for us. It is\n\f\nparadoxical and disturbing to us that economists have long praised foolish\nspending as a necessary ingredient of a successful economy. Let us call\nfoolish expenditures \"foolexures.\" And now you \nholders of old values are hearing one of your own add to the case for\n\"foolexures\" \nthe case for \"febezzelments\"-the \nfunctional equivalent of embezzlements. 'this may not seem like a nice way\nto start a new day. Please be assured that I don't like \"febezzlements.\" It is\njust that I think \"febezzlements\" are \nwidespread and have powerful economic effects. And I also think that one\nshould \nrecognize reality even when one doesn't like it, indeed, especially when one\ndoesn't like it. Also, I think one should \ncheerfully endure paradox that one \ncan't remove by good thinking. Even in pure mathematics, they can't\nremove \nall paradox, and the rest of us should \nalso recognize we are going to have to \nendure a lot of paradox, like it or nor. \n \nI also think that one should recognize reality even when one doesn't like it,\nindeed, especially when one doesn't like it. \n \nLet me also take this occasion to state that my previous notion of three\npercent of assets per annum in waste in much institutional investment\nmanagement related to stocks is quite likely too low in a great many cases.\n\f\nA friend, after my talk to foundation financial officers, sent me a summary\nof a study about mutual fund investors. The study concluded that the typical\nmutual fund investor gained at \n \n7.25 percent per -year in a fifteen-year period when the average stock fund\ngained at 12.8 percent per year (presumably after expenses). 'thus, the real\nperformance \nlag for investors was over five percent of assets per year in addition to\nwhatever \npercentage per year the mutual funds, after expenses, lagged behind stock\nmarket averages. If this mutual fund study is roughly right, it raises huge\nquestions about foundation wisdom in \nchanging investment managers all the time as mutual fund investors do. If\nthe extra lag reported in the mutual Fund study access comma it is\nprobably caused in considerable measure by for Li in constant\nremoval of assets from lagging portfolio managers being forced to\nliquidate stockholdings followed by placement of removed assets\nwith new investment managers that have high pressure but gaining\nhouses and their mouths and clients who is investment results will\nnot be improved by the super Rapid injection of new friends I am\nalways having trouble like that caused by this new mutual fund study\nand describe something realistically that looks so awful that my\ndescription is disregarded as extreme satire instead of reality next\nnew reality talks the horror of mind is believed description by some\nlarge amount no wonder Manga notions of reality are not widely\nwelcome this may be my last talk to charitable foundations"

    "raw_text": "prosperity has had a stronger boost from common stock-price-related\n\"wealth effects,\" some of them disgusting, than has been the case in many\nformer booms. If so, what was greater on the upside in the recent boom\ncould also be greater on the downside at some time of future stock price\ndecline. Incidentally, the economists may well conclude, eventually, that,\nwhen stock market advances and declines are regarded as long-lasting, there\nis more downside force on optional consumption per dollar of stock market\ndecline than there is upside force per dollar of stock market rise. I suspect\nthat economists would believe this already if they were more willing to take\nassistance from the best ideas outside their own discipline, or even to look\nharder at Japan. \n \nRemembering Japan, I also want to raise the possibility that there are, in the\nvery long term, \"virtue effects\" in economics-for instance, that widespread\ncorrupt accounting will eventually create bad long-term consequences as a\nsort of obverse effect from the virtue-based boost double-entry bookkeeping\ngave to the heyday of Venice. I suggest that when the financial scene starts\nreminding you of Sodom and Gomorrah, you should fear practical\nconsequences even if you like to participate in what is going on. \n \nFinally, I believe that implications for charitable foundations of my\nconclusions today, combined with conclusions in my former talk to\nfoundation financial officers, go way beyond implications for investment\ntechniques. If I am right, almost all U.S. foundations are unwise through\nfailure to understand their own investment operations, related to the larger\nsystem. If so, this is not good. A rough rule in life is that an organization\n\f\nfoolish in one way in dealing with a complex system is all too likely to be\nfoolish in another. So the wisdom of foundation donations may need as\nmuch improvement as investment practices of foundations. And here we\nhave two more old rules to guide us. One rule is ethical, and the other is\nprudential. \n \nThe ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson, who believed that maintenance of\neasily removable ignorance by a responsible officeholder was treacherous\nmalfeasance in meeting moral obligation. \n \nThe ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson, who believed that maintenance of\neasily removable ignorance by a responsible officeholder was treacherous\nmalfeasance in meeting moral obligation. The prudential rule is that\nunderlying the old Warner & Swasey advertisement for machine tools: \"The\nman who needs a new machine tool and hasn't bought it is already paying\nfor it.\" 'The Warner & Swasey rule also applies, I believe, to thinking tools.\nIf you don't have the right thinking tools, you, and the people you seek to\nhelp, are already suffering from your easily \nremovable ignorance. \n \nTalk Seven Revisited \n \nThis talk in November 2000 turned out to be pretty timely, because stock\nmarket unpleasantness therefore greatly increased, particularly for high-tech\nstocks.\n\f\nBut, as nearly as I can tell, there has been absolutely no theoretical reaction\nfrom anyone who heard or read the talk. I still believe everything I said\nabout significant macroeconomic effects from \"febezzlement\" through\nexcessive investment costs. \nBut no one trained in economics has ever tried to engage with me on this\nsubject. \n \nUndeterred by this apathy, I am now going to push my reasoning one notch\nfurther by laying out a \"thought experiment\" extrapolating the combined\nreasoning of Talks Six and Seven to an assumed higher level of investment\ncosts. \n \nAssume that 2006 stock prices rise by 200% while corporate earnings do\nnot rise, at which point all the sensibly distributable earnings of all U.S.\ncorporations combined amount to less than the total of all stockholder\ninvestment costs, because such costs rise proportionally with stock prices.\nNow so long as this situation continues. no money at all, net of investment\ncosts, is going out of all corporations to all corporate owners combined.\nInstead, frictional cost imposters get more than all sensibly distributable\ncorporate earnings. And at the end of any year, the corporate owners in\naggregate can get money by reason of their stockholding only by making\nstock sales to providers of \"new money\" who, considering high continuing\ninvestment costs for themselves and others, must expect that stock prices\nwill keep rising indefinitely while all stock owners, combined, are getting\nnothing, net, except by selling stock to more \"new money.\"\n\f\nTo many imposers of frictional investment costs, this peculiar state of\naffairs would seem ideal, with more than l00 % of sensibly distributable\ncorporate earnings going to precisely the right sort of people, instead of\nbeing wasted on the shareholders. And some economists would regard the\nresult as good because it came about in a market. But to me it would\nresemble a weird and disturbing combination of (1) a gambling casino\nimposing an unreasonably greedy take for the house, plus (2) a form of\nPonzi-like scheme, similar to the market for expensive art, in which\nparticipation would be unsuitable for pension funds, etc., plus (3) a bubble\nof speculation that would eventually burst, probably with unfortunate\nmacroeconomic consequences. And what the situation would not look like\nis a state of affairs likely to function well in guiding the capital\ndevelopment of the surrounding civilization. \n \nSuch a state of affairs, or even a lesser version, would, I think, reduce the\nreputation of our country, and deservedly so. \n \nThis parable and morality play gives Charlie a chance to vent his anger at\nthe accounting profession's role in corporate malfeasance. Hand written by\nCharlie when he was vacationing in the summer of 2000, the speech is an\neerie prediction of the scandals that surfaced well before his predicted date\nof 2003 and that continue today to be an important issue. \n \nThe early Quant Tech appears to be loosely based on C.

    "raw_text": "fatal flaw of not accounting properly for the real costs of employee stock\noptions. \n \nAfter 2003, people came to see the Quant Tech story as a sort of morality\nplay, divided into two acts. Act One, the era of the great founding engineer.\nwas seen as a golden age of sound values. Act Two, the era of the founder's\nimmediate successors, was seen as the age of false values with Quant Tech\nbecoming, in the end, a sort of latter-day Sodom or Gomorrah. \n \nIn fact, as this account will make clear, the change from good to evil did not\noccur all at once when Quant Tech's founder died in 1982. Much good\ncontinued after 1982, and serious evil had existed for many years prior to\n1982 in the financial culture in which Quant Tech had to operate. \n \nThe Quant Tech story is best understood as a classic sort of tragedy in\nwhich a single flaw is inexorably punished by remorseless Fate. The flaw\nwas the country's amazingly peculiar accounting treatment for employee\nstock options. The victims were Quant Tech and its country. The history of\nthe Great Financial Scandal, as it actually happened, could have been\nwritten try Sophocles. \n \nAs his life ended in 1982, Albert Herzog Quant delivered to his successors\nand his Maker a wonderfully prosperous and useful company. The sole\nbusiness of Quant Tech was designing, for fees, all over the world, a novel\ntype of superclean and super efficient small power plant that improved\nelectricity generation\n\f\nHe no more wanted bad accounting in his business than he wanted bad\nengineering. \n \nBy 1982, Quant Tech had a dominant market share in its business and was\nearning $100 million on revenues of $1 billion. Its costs were virtually all\ncosts to compensate technical employees engaged in design work. Direct\nemployee compensation cost amounted to seventy percent of revenues. Of\nthis seventy percent, thirty percent was base salaries and forty percent was\nincentive bonuses being paid out under an elaborate system designed by the\nfounder. All compensation was paid in cash. There were no stock options\nbecause the old man had considered the accounting treatment required for\nstock options to be \"weak, corrupt, and contemptible,\" and he no more\nwanted bad accounting in his business than he wanted bad engineering.\nMoreover, the old man believed in tailoring his huge incentive bonuses to\nprecise performance standards established for individuals or small groups,\ninstead of allowing what he considered undesirable compensation\noutcomes, both high and low, such as he believed occurred under other\ncompanies' stock option plans. \n \nYet, even under the old man's system, most of Quant Tech's devoted\nlongtime employees were becoming rich, or sure to get rich. This was\nhappening because the employees were buying Quant Tech stock in the\nmarket, just like non employee shareholders. The old man had always\nfigured that people smart enough, and self disciplined enough, to design\npower plants could reasonably be expected to take care of their own\n\f\nfinancial affairs in this way. He would sometimes advise an employee to\nbuy Quant Tech stock, but more paternalistic than that he would not\nbecome. \n \nBy the time the founder died in 1982, Quant Tech was debt free and, except\nas a reputation-enhancer, really didn't need any shareholders' equity to run\nits business, no matter how fast revenues grew.   \nHowever, the old man believed with Ben Franklin that \"it is hard for an\nempty sack to stand upright,\" and he wanted Quant Tech to stand upright.\nMoreover, he loved his business and his coworkers and always wanted to\nhave on hand large amounts of cash equivalents so as to be able to\nmaximize workout or work-up chances if an unexpected adversity or\nopportunity came along. And so, in 1982, Quant Tech had on hand $500\nmillion in cash equivalents, amounting to fifty percent of revenues. \n \nPossessing a strong balance sheet and a productive culture and also holding\na critical mass of expertise in a rapidly changing and rapidly growing\nbusiness, Quant Tech, using the old man's methods, by 1982 was destined\nfor twenty years ahead to maintain profits at ten percent of revenues while\nrevenues increased at twenty percent per year. After these twenty years,\ncommencing in 2003, Quant Tech's profit margin would hold for a very\nlong time at ten percent while revenue growth would slow down to four\npercent per year. But no one at Quant Tech knew precisely when it's\ninevitable period of slow revenue growth would begin.\n\f\nThe old man's dividend policy for Quant Tech was simplicity itself He\nnever paid a dividend. Instead, all earnings simply piled up in cash\nequivalents. \n \nEvery truly sophisticated investor in common stocks could see that the\nstock of cash-rich Quant Tech provided a splendid investment opportunity\nin 1982 when it sold at a mere fifteen times earnings and, despite its\nbrilliant prospects, had a market capitalization of only $1.5 billion. This low\nmarket capitalization, despite brilliant \n \nprospects, existed in l982 because other wonderful common stocks were\nalso then selling at fifteen times earnings, or less, as a natural consequence\nof high interest rates then prevailing plus disappointing investment returns\nthat had occurred over many previous years fur holders of typical\ndiversified portfolios of common stocks. \n \nOne result of Quant Tech's low market capitalization in 1982 was that it\nmade QuantTech's directors uneasy and dissatisfied right after the old man's\ndeath. A wiser board could then have bought in Quant Tech's stock very\naggressively., using up all cash on hand and also borrowing funds to use in\nthe same was However. such a decision, as not in accord with conventional\ncorporate wisdom in l982. And so the directors made a conventional\ndecision. They recruited a new CEO and CFO from outside QuantTech, in\nparticular form a company that then had a conventional stock option plan\nfor employees and also possessed a market capitalization at twenty times\nreported earnings, even though its balance sheet was weaker than Quant\n\f\nTech's and its earnings were growing more slowly than earnings at Quant\nTech. Incident to the recruitment of the new executives, it was made plain\nthat Quant Tech's directors wanted a higher market capitalization as soon as\nfeasible. \n \nThe newly installed Quant Tech officers qUickly realized that the company\ncould not wisely drive its revenues up at an annual rate higher than the rate\nin place or increase Quant Tech profit margin. The founder had plainly\nachieved an optimum in each case. Nor did the new officers dare tinker with\nan engineering culture that was working so well. 'Therefore, the new\nofficers were attracted to employing what they called \"modern financial\nengineering,\" which required prompt use of any and all arguably lawful\nmethods for driving up reported earnings, with big, simple changes to be\nmade first \n \nBy a strange irony of fate, the accounting convention for stock options that\nhad so displeased Quant Tech's founder now made the new officers' job\nvery easy and would ultimately ruin Quant Tech's reputation. There was\nnow an accounting convention in the United States that, provided\nemployees were first given options, required that when easily marketable\nstock was issued to employees at a below-market price, the bargain element\nfor the employees, although roughly equivalent to cash, could not count as\ncompensation expense in determining a company's reported profits. This\namazingly peculiar accounting convention had been selected by the\naccounting profession, over the objection of some of its wisest and most\nethical members, because corporate managers, by and large, preferred that\n\f\ntheir gains from exercising options covering their employers' stock not be\ncounted as expense in determining their employers' earnings. The\naccounting profession, in making its amazingly peculiar decision, had\nsimply followed the injunction so often followed by persons quite different\nfrom prosperous, entrenched accountants. The injunction was that normally\nfollowed by insecure and powerless people: \"Whose bread I eat, his song I\nsing.\" Fortunately, the income tax authorities did not have the same\namazingly peculiar accounting idea as the accounting profession.\nElementary common sense prevailed, and the bargain \nelement in stock option exercises was treated as an obvious compensation\nexpense, \ndeductible in determining income for tax purposes. \n \nThe injunction was that normally followed by insecure and powerless\npeople: \"Whose bread eat his song i sing.\" \n \nQuant Tech's new officers, financially shrewd as they were, could see at a\nglance that, given the amazingly peculiar accounting convention and the\nsound income tax rules in place, Quant Tech had a breathtakingly large\nopportunity to increase its reported profits by taking very simple action.\nThe fact that so large a share of Quant Tech's annual expense was incentive\nbonus expense provided a \"modern financial engineering\" opportunity\nsecond to none. \n \nFor instance, it was mere child's play for the executives to realize that if in\n1982 Quant Tech had substituted employee stock option exercise profits for\n\f\nall its incentive bonus expense of $400 million while using bonus money\nsaved plus option prices paid to buy back all shares issued in option\nexercises and keeping all else the same, the result would have been to drive\nQuant Tech 1982 reported earnings up by 400 percent to $500 million from\n$100 million while shares outstanding remained exactly the same! And so it\nseemed that the obviously correct plot for the officers was to start\nsubstituting employee stock option exercise profits for incentive bonuses.\nWhy should a group of numerate engineers care whether their bonuses were\nin cash or virtually perfect equivalents of cash? Arranging such\nsubstitutions, on any schedule desired, seemed like no difficult chore. \n \nHowever, it was also mere child's play for the new officers to realize that a\ncertain amount of caution and restraint would be desirable in pushing their\nnew ploy. Obviously, if they pushed their new ploy too hard in any single\nyear, there might be rebellion from Quant Tech's accountants or undesirable\nhostility from other sources. This, in turn, would risk killing a goose with a\nvast ability to deliver golden eggs, at least to the officers. After all, it was\nquite clear that their ploy would be increasing reported earnings only by\nadding to real earnings an element of phony earnings phony in the sense\nthat Quant Tech would enjoy no true favorable economic effect (except\ntemporary fraud-type effect similar to that from overcounting closing\ninventory) from that part of reported earnings increases attributable to use\nof the ploy. The new CEO privately called the desirable, cautious approach\n\"wisely restrained falsehood.\" \n \n\"The Right Way to Behave is to Never Let Improper Accounting Start\"\n\f\nIn 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed that part of\nthe real cost of employee stock options be recognized as an expense.\nBecause of stiff opposition from both the business community and\nCongress, the proposal was greatly diluted, requiring only some disclosure\nin footnotes. Today, however, generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe U.S. require some part of the real cost of employee stock options to be\nrecorded as an expense in the income statement. Charlie remains skeptical:\n\"By the time stock options are exercised, the total cost charged is usually\nfar less than total cost incurred. Moreover, the part of cost that is charged to\nearnings is often manipulated downward by dubious techniques. This kind\nof thing has always been hard to stamp out. The right way to behave is to\nnever let improper accounting start.\" \n \nThe outside accountants would probably find it unendurably embarrassing\nnot to bless new financial statements containing only the same phony\nproportion of reported earnings increase. \n \nPlainly, the new officers saw, it would be prudent to shift bonus payments\nto employee stock option exercise profits in only a moderate amount per\nyear over many years ahead. They privately called the prudent plan they\nadopted their \"dollop by dollop system,\" which they believed had four\nobvious advantages: \n \nFirst, a moderate dollop of phony earnings in any single year would be less\nlikely to be noticed than a large dollop."

    "raw_text": "Second, the large long-term effect from accumulating many moderate\ndollops of phony earnings over the years would also tend to be obscured in\nthe \"dollop by dollop system.\" As the CFO pithily and privately said, \"If we\nmix only a moderate minority share of turds with the raisins each year,\nprobably no one will recognize what will ultimately become a very large\ncollection of turds.\" \n \nThird, the outside accountants, once they had blessed a few financial\nstatements containing earnings increases, only a minority share of which\nwere phony, would probably find it unendurably embarrassing not to bless\nnew financial statements containing only the same phony proportion of\nreported earnings increase. \n \nFourth, the \"dollop by dollop system\" would tend to prevent disgrace, or\nsomething more seriously harmful, for Quant Tech's officers. With virtually\nall corporations except Quant Tech having ever-more-liberal stock option\nplans, the officers could always explain that a moderate dollop of shift\ntoward compensation in option-exercise form was needed to help attract or\nretain employees. Indeed, given corporate culture and stock market\nenthusiasm likely to exist as a consequence of the strange accounting\nconvention for stock options, this claim would often be true. \n \nWith these four advantages, the \"dollop by dollop system\" seemed so\nclearly desirable that it only remained for Quant Tech's officers to decide\nhow big to make their annual dollops of phony earnings. This decision, too,\n\f\nturned out to be easy. The officers first decided upon three reasonable\nconditions they wanted satisfied: \n \nFirst, they wanted to be able to continue their \"dollop by dollop system\"\nwithout \nmajor discontinuities for twenty years. \n \nSecond, they wanted Quant Tech's reported earnings to go up by roughly\nthe same percentage each year throughout the whole twenty years because\nthey believed that financial analysts, representing institutional investors,\nwould value Quant Tech's stock higher if reported annual earnings growth\nnever significantly varied. \n \nThird, to protect credibility for reported earnings, they never wanted to\nstrain credulity of investors by reporting, even in their twentieth year, that\nQuant Tech was earning more than forty percent of revenues from\ndesigning power plants. \n \nWith these requirements, the math was easy, given the officers' assumption\nthat Quant Tech's non-phony earnings and revenues were both going to\ngrow at twenty percent per year for twenty years. The officers quickly\ndecided to use their \"dollop by dollop system\" to make Quant Tech's\nreported earnings increase by twenty-eight percent per year instead of the\ntwenty percent that would have been reported by the \nfounder.\n\f\nAnd so, the great scheme of \"modern financial engineering\" went forward\ntoward tragedy at Quant Tech. \n \nAnd so, the great scheme of \"modern financial engineering\" went forward\ntoward tragedy at Quant Tech. And few disreputable schemes of man have\never worked better in achieving what was attempted. Quant Tech's reported\nearnings, certified by its accountants, increased regularly at twenty-eight\npercent per year. No one criticized Quant techs financial reporting except a\nfew people widely regarded as impractical, overly theoretical, misanthropic\ncranks. It turned out that the founder's policy of never paying dividends,\nwhich was continued, greatly helped in preserving credibility for Quant\nTech's reports that its earnings were rising steadily at twenty eight percent\nper year. With cash equivalents on hand so remarkably high, the Pavlovian\nmere-association effects that so often impair reality recognition served well\nto prevent detection of the phony element in reported earnings \n \n379 \n \nIt was, therefore, natural, after the \"dollop by dollop system\" had been in\nplace for a few years, for Quant Tech's officers to yearn to have Quant\nTech's reported earnings per share keep going up at twenty eight percent per\nyear while cash equivalents grew much faster than they were then growing.\nThis turned out to be a snap. by this time, Quant Tech's stock was selling at\na huge multiple of reported earnings, and the officers simply started causing\nsome incremental stock-option exercises that were not matched either\n\f\nby reductions in cash bonuses paid or by repurchases of Quant Tech's stock.\nThis change, the officers easily recognized, was a very helpful revision of\ntheir original plan. Not only was detection of the phony element in reported\nearnings made much more difficult as cash accumulation greatly\naccelerated, but also a significant amount of Ponzi-scheme or chain-letter\neffect was being introduced into Quant Tech, with real benefits for present\nshareholders, including the officers. \n \nAt this time, the officers also fixed another flaw in their original plan. They\nsaw that as Quant tech's reported earnings, containing an increasing phony\nelement, kept rising at twenty-eight percent, Quant Tech's income taxes as a\npercentage of reported pretax earnings kept going lower and lower. This\nplainly increased chances for causing undesired questions and criticism.\nThis problem was soon eliminated. Many power plants in foreign nations\nwere built and owned by governments, and it proved easy to get some\nforeign governments to raise Quant Tech's design fees, provided that in\neach case slightly more than the fee increase was paid back in additional\nincome taxes to the foreign government concerned. \n \nFinally, for 2002, Quant Tech reported $16 billion in earnings on $47 billion\nof revenues that now included a lot more revenue from interest on cash\nequivalents than would have been present without net issuances of new\nstock over the years. Cash equivalents on hand now amounted to an\nastounding $85 billion, and somehow it didn't seem impossible to most\ninvestors that a company virtually drowning in so much cash could be\nearning the $16 billion it was reporting. The market capitalization of Quant\n\f\nTech at its peak early in 2003 became $1.4 trillion, about ninety times\nearnings reported for 2002. \n \nGeometric Progressions: Highly Counterintuitive \nSeeking to teach his young charge a lesson in the power of compounding, a\nteacher made an intriguing offer: \n \n\"I will give you one of the following, but you cannot change your mind\nlater, so think carefully before you decide. I will give you $1,000 per day\nfor thirty days that you can begin spending immediately. Alternatively, I\nwill give you a penny on day one, double it on day two, double the resulting\nsum again on day three, and continue doubling your holdings every day for\nthirty days, but you may not spend a single cent until the thirtieth day has\npassed.\" \nThe young charge, enticed by the prospect of spending $1,000 per day for a\nmonth compared to what he believed would be just a few pennies jingling\naround in his pocket a month from now, chose the $1,000 per day for a\nmonth. Did he choose wise $ \nUnder the first choice, the young charge would receive a total of $30,000.\nUnder the second choice, the power of compounding would run the total to\n$5,368,709.12. \n \nAll man's desired geometric progressions, if a high rate of growth is chosen,\nat last come to grief on a finite earth."

And the social system for\nman on earth is fair enough, eventually, that almost all massive cheating\nends in disgrace. And in 2003, Quant Tech failed in both ways. \n \nBy 2003, Quant Tech's real earning power was growing at only four percent\nper year after sales growth had slowed to four percent. There was now no\nway for Quant Tech to escape causing a big disappointment for its\nshareholders, now largely consisting of institutional investors. This\ndisappointment triggered a shocking decline in the price of Quant Tech\nstock, which went down suddenly by fifty percent. This price decline, in\nturn, triggered a careful examination of Quant Tech's financial reporting\npractices, which, at long last, convinced nearly everyone that a very large\nmajority of Quant Tech's reported earnings had long been phony earnings\nand that massive and deliberate misreporting had gone on for a great many\nyears. \n \nThis triggered even more price decline for Quant Tech stock until in mid-\n2003 the market capitalization of QuantTech was only $140 billion, down\nninety percent from its peak only six months earlier. \n \nA quick ninety percent decline in the price of the stock of such an important\ncompany that was previously so widely owned and admired caused\nimmense human suffering, considering the $1.3 trillion in market value that\nhad disappeared. And naturally', with Quant Tech's deserved disgrace, the\npublic and political reaction included intense hatred and revulsion directed\n\f\nat QuantTech even though its admirable engineers were still designing the\nnation's best power plants. \n \nMoreover, the hatred and revulsion did not stop with Quant Tech. It soon\nspread to other corporations, some of which plainly had undesirable\nfinancial cultures different from QuantTech's only in degree. 'The public\nand political hatred, like the behavior that had caused it, soon went to gross\nexcess and fed upon itself. Financial misery spread far beyond investors\ninto a serious recession like that of Japan in the 1990s following the long\nperiod of false Japanese accounting. \n \nJohn Kenneth Galbraith (b. 1908) \nFamed economist John Kenneth Galbraith offers his wisdom: \n \n\"We all agree that pessimism is a mark of superior intellect.\" \n \n\"There is certainly no absolute standard of beauty, That precisely is what\nmakes its pursuit so interesting.\" \n \n\"Meetings are indispensable when you don't want to do anything.\" \n \n\"The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look\nrespectable.\" \n \n\"The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in\nmoral philosophy that is, the search for a superior moral justification for\n\f\nselfishness. \" \n \n\"More die in the United States of too much food than of too little.\" \n*Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is\nno need to do so, almost everyone gets bury on the proof.\" \n \n\"People who are in a fortunate position always attribute virtue to that makes\nthem so happy.\" \n \n\"Do you understand 'it is a far, far better thing to have a firm anchor in\nnonsense than to put out on the troubled seas of thought.\"' \n \n\"People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than\nsurrender any material part of their advantage'\" \n \n\"In any great organization it is far, far safer to be wrong with the majority\nthan to be right alone.\" \n \nThere was huge public antipathy to professions following the (great\nScandal. The accounting profession, of course, got the most blame. The\nrule-making body for accountants had long borne the acronym  \n\"F,A.S.B.\" And now nearly everyone said this stood for \"Financial\nAccounts Still Bogus.\" \n \nEconomics professors, likewise, drew much criticism for failing to blow the\nwhistle on false accounting and for not sufficiently warning about eventual\n\f\nbad macroeconomic effects of widespread false accounting. So great was\nthe disappointment with conventional economists that Harvard's John\nKenneth Galbraith received the Nobel Prize in economics. After all, he had\nonce predicted that massive, \nundetected corporate embezzlement would have a wonderfully stimulating\neffect on the economy. And people could now see that something very close\nto what Galbraith had predicted had actually happened in the years\npreceding 2003 and had thereafter helped create a big, reactive recession. \n \nWith Congress and the SEC so heavily peopled by lawyers, and with\nlawyers having been so heavily involved in drafting financial disclosure\ndocuments now seen as bogus, there was a new \"lawyer\" joke every week.\none such was: \"The butcher says, 'The reputation of lawyers has fallen\ndramatically,' and the checkout clerk replies, 'How do you fall dramatically\noff a pancake?\"' \n \nBut the hostility to established professions did not stop with accountants,\neconomists, and lawyers. There were many adverse \"rub-off' effects on\nreputations of professionals that had always performed well, like engineers,\nwho did not understand the financial fraud that their country had made a\nconventional requirement. \n \nIn the end, much that was good about the country, and needed for its future\nfelicity, was widely and unwisely hated.\n\f\nAt this point, action came from a Higher Realm. God himself, who reviews\nall, changed His decision schedule to bring to the fore the sad case of the\nGreat Financial Scandal of 2003. He called in his chief detective and said,\n\"Smith, bring in for harsh but fair judgment the most depraved of those\nresponsible for this horrible outcome.\" \n \nBut when Smith brought in a group of security analysts who had long and\nuncritically touted the stock of Quant Tech, the Great Judge was displeased.\n\"Smith,\" he said, \"I can't come down hardest on low-level cognitive error,\nmuch of it subconsciously caused by the standard incentive systems of the\nworld.\" \n \nNext, Smith brought in a group of SEC commissioners and powerful\npoliticians. \"No, no,\" said the Great Judge, \"These people operate in a\nvirtual maelstrom of regrettable forces and can't reasonably be expected to\nmeet the behavioral standard you seek to impose.\" \n \nNow the chief detective thought he had gotten the. He next brought\nin the corporate officers who had practice their version of modern\nfinancial Engineering at quantech you are getting close said the\ngreat judge but I told you to bring and the most depraved these\nofficers well of course get strong punishment for their massive fraud\nand disgusting stewardship of the great engineers Legacy but I want\nyou to bring the main screen and who will soon be in the lowest\ncircle and help the ones who so easily could have prevented all this\ncalamity At last, the chief detective truly understood he remembered"

Moreover, the unsound accounting is more virulent than the\nmurderous construction practice. After all, the defective constructors have a\nharder time rationalizing their deplorable behavior. And, therefore, the bad\naccounting will more easily spread than the defective construction. Which\nis exactly what happened, as defective accounting for stock options became\nubiquitous. \n \nThere has been some good news since talk Eight was delivered. The\naccounting profession now requires that some provision for stock option\ncost be charged against earnings. However, by the time stock options are\nexercised, the total cost charged is usually far less than total cost incurred.\nMoreover the part of cost that is charged to earnings is often manipulated\ndownward by dubious techniques. \n \nWhat this accounting saga constitutes is one more sad example of evil\nrewarded dying hard, as a great many people conclude that something can't\nbe evil if they are profiting from it. \n \n\"Pleasure is the greatest incentive to eviL.\" \n-Plato"

    "raw_text": "Needs  \nFlerb Kay Undergraduate Lecture University of California, Santa Barbara\nEconomics Department, October 3, 2003 \n \nI have outlined some remarks in a rough way, and after I'm finished talking\nfrom that outline, I'll take questions as long as anybody can endure\nlistening, until they drag me away to wherever else I'm supposed to go. As\nyou might guess. I agreed to do this because the subject of getting the soft\nsciences so they talk better to each other has been one that has interested me\nfor decades. And, of course, economics is, in many respects, the queen of\nthe soft sciences. It's expected to be better than the rest. It's my view that\neconomics is better at the multidisciplinary stuff than the rest of the soft\nscience. And it's also my view that it's still lousy and I'd like to discuss chis\nfailure in this talk. \n \nAs I talk about strengths and weaknesses in academic economics, one\ninteresting fact you are entitled to know is that I never took a course in\neconomics. And with this striking lack of credentials, you may wonder why\nI have the chutzpah to be up here giving this talk. The answer is I have a\nblack belt in chutzpah. I was born with it. Some people, like some of the\nwomen I know, have a black belt in spending. They were born with that.\nBut what they gave me was a black belt in chutzpah. \n \nBut, I come from two peculiar strands of experience that may have given\nme some useful economic insights. One is Berkshire Hathaway, and the\nother is my personal educational history. Berkshire, of course, has finally\n\f\ngotten interesting. When Warren took over Berkshire, the market\ncapitalization was about $10 million. And forty-something years later, there\nare not many more shares outstanding now than there were then, and the\nmarket capitalization is about a $100 billion, ten thousand for one. And\nsince that has happened, year after year, in kind of a grind-ahead fashion\nwith very few failures, it eventually drew some attention, indicating that\nmaybe Warren and I knew something useful in microeconomics. \n \n\"If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. \n \nFor a long time there was a Nobel Prize-winning economist who explained\nBerkshire Hathaway's success as follows: \n \nFirst, he said Berkshire beat the market in common stock investing through\none sigma of luck because nobody could beat the market except by luck.\nThis hard-form version of efficient market theory was taught in most\nschools of economics at the time. People were taught that nobody could\nbeat the market. Next, the professor went to two sigmas, and three sigmas,\nand four sigmas, and when he finally got to six \nsigmas of luck, people were laughing so hard he stopped doing it. \n \nThen, he reversed the explanation 180 degrees. He said, \"No, it was still six\nsigmas, but it was six sigmas of skill.\" Well, this very sad history\ndemonstrates the truth of Benjamin Franklin's observation in Poor Richard's\nAlmanack, \"If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.\"\n\f\nThe man changed his silly view when his incentives made him change it\nand not before. \n \nI watched the same thing happen at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at ULAC. I\nasked, at one point, \"Why are you treating cataracts only with a totally\nobsolete cataract operation?\" And the man said to me, \"Charlie, it's such a\nwonderful operation to teach.\" When he stopped using that operation, it was\nbecause almost all the patients had voted with their feet. Again, appeal to\ninterest and not to reason if you want to change conclusions. \n \nWell, Berkshire's whole record has been achieved without paying one ounce\nof attention to the efficient market theory in its hard form. And not one\nounce of attention to the descendants of that idea, which came out of\nacademic economics and went into corporate finance and morphed into\nsuch obscenities as the capital asset pricing model, which we also paid no\nattention to. I think you'd have to believe in the tooth fairy to believe that\nyou could easily outperform the market by seven percentage points per\nannum just by investing in high-volatility stocks. \n \nYet, believe it or not, like the Jules Stein doctor, people once believed this\nstuff. And the belief was rewarded. And it spread. And many people still\nbelieve it. But Berkshire never paid any attention to it. And now, I think the\nworld is coming our way, and the idea of perfection in all market outcomes\nis going the way of the dodo.\n\f\nIt was always clear to me that the stock market couldn't be perfectly\nefficient, because, as a teenager, I'd been to the racetrack in Omaha where\nthey had the parimutuel system. And it was quite obvious to me that if the\nhouse take, the croupier's take, was seventeen percent, some people\nconsistently lost a lot less then seventeen percent of all their bets, and other\npeople consistently lost more than seventeen percent of all their bets. So the\npari-mutuel system in Omaha had no perfect efficiency. And so I didn't\naccept the argument that the stock market was always perfectly efficient in\ncreating rational prices. \n \nIndeed, there have been some documented cases since of people getting so\ngood at understanding horses and odds that they actually are able to beat the\nhouse in off track betting. There aren't many people who can do that, but\nthere are a few people in America who can. \n \nNext, my personal education history is interesting because its deficiencies\nand my peculiarities eventually created advantages. For some odd reason, I\nhad an early and extreme multidisciplinary cast of mind. I couldn't stand\nreaching for a small idea in my own discipline when there was a big idea\nright over the fence in somebody else's discipline. So I just grabbed in all\ndirections for the big ideas that would really work. Nobody taught me to do\nthat; I was just born with that yen. I also was born with a huge craving for\nsynthesis. And when it didn't come easily, which was often, I would rag the\nproblem, and then when I failed, I would put it aside, and I'd come back to\nit and rag it again. It took me twenty years to figure out how and why cult\n\f\nconversion methods worked. But the psychology departments haven't\nfigured it out yet, so I'm ahead of them. \n \nBut anyway, I have this tendency to want to rag the problems. Because\nWWII caught me, I drifted into some physics, and the Air Corps sent me to\nCaltech, where I did a little more physics as part[ of being made into a\nmeteorologist. And there, at a very young age, I absorbed what I call the\nfundamental full attribution ethos of hard science. And that was enormously\nuseful to me. Let me explain that ethos. \n \nUnder this ethos, you've got to know all the big ideas in all the disciplines\nmore fundamental than your own. You can never make any explanation that\ncan be made in a more fundamental way in any other way than the most\nfundamental way. And you always take with full attribution to the most\nfundamental ideas that you are required to use. When you're using physics,\nyou say you're using physics. When you're using biology, you say you're\nusing biology. And so on and so on. I could early see that that ethos would\nact as a fine organizing system for my thought. And I strongly suspected\nthat it would work really well in the soft sciences as well as the hard\nsciences, so I just grabbed it and used it all through my life in soft science\nas well as hard science. That was a very lucky idea for me. \n \nLet me explain how extreme that ethos is in hard science. There is a\nconstant, one of the fundamental constants in physics, known as\nBoltzmann's constant. You probably all know it very well. And the\ninteresting thing about Boltzmann's constant is that Boltzmann didn't"

    "raw_text": "discover it. So why is Boltzmann's constant now named for Boltzmann?\nWell, the answer is that Boltzmann derived that constant from basic physics\nin a more fundamental way than the poor forgotten fellow who found the\nconstant in the first place in some less fundamental way. The ethos of hard\nscience is so strong in favor of reductionism to the more fundamental body\nof knowledge that you can wash the discoverer right out of history when\nsomebody else handles his discovery in a more fundamental way. I think\nthat is correct. I think Boltzmann's constant should be named for\nBoltzmann. \n \nBoltzmann's Constant \nBoltzmann constant derives its name from Austrian physicist Ludwig\nBoltzmann (1844-1906); it defines the relation between absolute\ntemperature and the kinetic energy contained in each molecule of an ideal\ngas. In general, the energy in a gas molecule is directly proportional to the\nabsolute temperature. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy per\nmolecule increases. As a gas is heated, its molecules move more rapidly.\nThis movement produces increased pressure if the gas is confined in a space\nof constant volume, or increased volume if the pressure remains constant. \n \nAt any rate, in my history and Berkshire's history, Berkshire went on and on\ninto considerable economic success while ignoring the hard-form efficient\nmarkets doctrine once very popular in academic economics and ignoring\nthe descendants of that doctrine in corporate finance where the results\nbecame even sillier than they were in economics. This naturally encouraged\nme.\n\f\nFinally, with my peculiar history, I'm also bold enough to be here today\nbecause, at least when I was young, I wasn't a total klutz. For one year at\nthe Harvard Law School, I was ranked second in a very large group, and I\nalways figured that, while there were always a lot of people much smarter\nthan I was, I didn't have to hang back totally in the thinking game. \n \nLet me begin by discussing the obvious strengths of academic economics.\nThe first obvious strength, and this is true of a lot of places that get repute,\nis that it was in the right place at the right time. Two hundred years ago,\naided by the growth of technology and the growth of other developments in\nthe civilization, the real output per capita of the civilized world started\ngoing up at about two percent per annum,  compounded. And before that,\nfor the previous thousands of years, it had gone up at a rate that hovered\njust a hair's breadth above zero. And, of course, economics grew up amid\nthis huge success. Partly it helped the success, and partly it explained it. So,\nnaturally, academic economics grew. And, lately, with the collapse of all the\ncommunist economies, as the free market economies or partially free\nmarket economies flourished. that added to the reputation of economics.\nEconomics has been a very favorable place to be if you're in academia. \n \nEconomics was always more multidisciplinary than the rest of soft science.\nIt just reached out and grabbed things as it needed to. And that tendency to\njust grab whatever you need from the rest of knowledge if you're an\neconomist has reached a fairly high point in N. Gregory Mankiw's new\ntextbook. I checked out chat textbook. I must have been one of the few\n\f\nbusinessmen in America that bought it immediately when it came out\nbecause it had gotten such a big advance. I wanted to figure out what the\nguy was doing where he could get an advance that great. So this is how I\nhappened to riffle through Mankiw's freshman textbook. And there I found\nlaid out as principles of economics: Opportunity cost is a superpower, to be\nused by all people who have any hope of getting the right answer. Also,\nincentives are superpowers. \n \nAnd lastly the tragedy of the commons model, popularized by longtime\nfriend, UCSB's Garrett Hardin. Hardin caused the delightful introduction\ninto economics-alongside Smith's beneficent invisible hand of Hardin's\nwicked evildoing invisible foot. Well, I thought that the Hardin model made\neconomics more complete, and I knew when Hardin introduced me to his\nmodel, the tragedy of the commons, that it would be in the economics\ntextbooks eventually. And, lo and behold, it finally made it about twenty\nyears later. And it's right for Mankiw to reach out into other disciplines and\ngrab Hardin's model and anything else that works well. \n \nAnother thing that helped economics is that, from the beginning, it attracted\nthe best brains in soft science. Its denizens also interacted more with the\npractical world than was at all common in soft science and the rest of\nacademia, and that resulted in very creditable outcomes like the three\ncabinet appointments of economics Ph.D. George Shultz and the cabinet\nappointment of Larry Summers. So this has been a very favored part of\nacademia."

    "raw_text": "Also, economics early on attracted some of the best writers of language in\nthe history of the Earth. You start out with Adam Smith. Adam Smith was\nso good a thinker and so good a writer that, in his own time, Emmanuel\nKant, then the greatest intellectual in Germany, simply announced that there\nwas nobody in Germany to equal Adam Smith. Well, Voltaire, being an\neven pithier speaker than Kant, which wouldn't be that hard, immediately\nsaid, \"Oh well, France doesn't have anybody who can even be compared to\nAdam Smith.\" So economics started with some very great men and great\nwriters. \n \nAnd then, there have been later great writers like John Maynard Keynes,\nwhom I quote all the time and who has added a great amount of\nillumination to my life. And finally, even in the present era, if you take Paul\nKrugman and read his essays, you will be impressed by his fluency. I can't\nstand his politics; I'm on the other side. But I love this man's essays. I think\nPaul Krugman is one of the best essayists alive. And so, economics has\nconstantly attracted these fabulous writers. And they are so good that they\nhave this enormous influence far outside their economic discipline, and\nthat's very uncommon in other academic departments. \n \nOkay, now it's time to extend criticism instead of praise. We've recognized\nthat economics is better than other soft science academic departments in\nmany ways. And one of the glories of civilization. Now it's only fair that we\noutline a few things that are wrong with academic economics. \n \nWhat's Wrong with Economics?"

    "raw_text": "1) Fatal Unconnectedness, Leading to Man-with-a-Hammer Syndrome,\nOften Causing Overweighing What Can Be Counted \n \nI think I've got eight, no nine objections, some being logical subdivisions of\na big general objection. The big general objection to economics was the one\nearly described by Alfred North Whitehead when he spoke of the fatal\nunconnectedness of academic disciplines, wherein each professor didn't\neven know the models of the other disciplines, much less try to synthesize\nthose disciplines with his own. \n \nI think there's a modern name for this approach that Whirehead didn't like,\nand that name is \"bonkers.\" This is a perfectly crazy way to behave. Yet\neconomics, like much else in academia. is too insular. \n \nThe nature of this failure is that it creates what I always call man-with-a-\nhammer syndrome. And that's taken from the folk saying: To the man with\nonly a hammer, every problem looks pretty much like a nail. And that\nworks marvelously to gum up all professions and all departments of\nacademia and, indeed, most practical life. The only antidote for being an\nabsolute klutz due to the presence of a man-with a-hammer syndrome is to\nhave a full kit of tools. You don't have just a hammer. \n \nAlfred North Whitehead (186r-1947) \nAlfred North Whitehead. a British philosopher and mathematician, worked\nin logic, mathematics, philosophy of science, and metaphysics.'Whitehead\n\f\nis known for developing process philosophy, a view holding that\nfundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience. In this\nview, concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of\nexperience. By grouping occasions of experience, something as complex as\na human being can be defined. Whitehead's views evolved into process\ntheology, a way of understanding God. His best' known mathematics work\nis Principia Mathematica co written with Bertrand Russell. \n \nYou've got all the tools. And you've got to have one more trick. You've got\nto use those tools checklist-style because you'll miss a lot if you just hope\nthat the right tool is going to pop up unaided whenever you need it. But if\nyou've got a full list of tools and go through them in your mind, checklist-\nstyle, you will find a lot of answers that you won't find any other way. So\nlimiting this big general objection that so disturbed Alfred North Whitehead\nis very important, and there are mental tricks that help do the job. \n \nI think there's a modern name for this approach that Whirehead didn't like,\nand that name is \"bonkers.\" \n \nA special version of this man-with-a-hammer syndrome is terrible, not only\nin economics but practically everywhere else, including business. It's really\nterrible in business. You've got a complex system, and it spews out a lot of\nwonderful numbers that enable you to measure some factors. But there are\nother factors that are terribly important, [yet] there's no precise numbering\nyou can put to these factors. You know they're important, but you don't have\nthe numbers. well, practically everybody (1) overweighs the stuff that can\n\f\nbe numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques they're taught in\nacademia and \n(2) doesn't mix in the hard-to-measure stuff that may be more important.\nThat is a mistake I've tried all my life to avoid, and I have no regrets for\nhaving done that. \n \nThe late, great Thomas Hunt Morgan, who was one of greatest biologists\nwho ever lived, when he got to Caltech, had a very interesting, extreme way\nof avoiding some mistakes from overcounting what could be measured and\nundercounting what couldn't. At that time. there were no computers, and the\ncomputer substitute then available to science and engineering was the\nFriden calculator, and Caltech was full of Friden calculators. And Thomas\nHunt Morgan banned the Friden calculator from the biology department.\nAnd when they said, \"What the hell are you doing, Dr. Morgan?\" he said,\n\"Well, I am like a guy Who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the\nSacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and\npick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to\nlet any people in my department waste scarce resources in placer mining.\"\nAnd that's the way Thomas Hunt Morgan got through life. \n \nI've adopted the same technique, and here I am in my eightieth year. I\nhaven't had to do any placer mining yet. And it begins to look like I'm going\nto get all the way through, as I'd always hoped, without doing any of that\ndamned placer mining. Of course, if I were a physician, particularly an\nacademic physician, I'd have to do the statistics, do the placer mining. But\nit's amazing what you can do in life without the placer mining if you've got\n\f\na few good mental tricks and just keep ragging the problems the way\nThomas Hunt Morgan did. \n \n2) Failure to Follow the Fundamental Full-Attribution Ethos of Hard\nScience \n \nWhat's wrong with the way Mankiw does economics is that he grabs from\nother disciplines without attribution. He doesn't label the grabbed items as\nphysics or biology or psychology or game theory or whatever they really\nare, fully attributing the concept to the basic knowledge from which it\ncame. If you don't do that, it's like running a business with a sloppy filing\nsystem. It reduces your power to be as good as you can be. Now Mankiw is\nso smart he does pretty well even when his technique is imperfect. He got\nthe largest advance any textbook writer ever got. \n \nBut, nonetheless, he'd be better if he had absorbed a hard-science ethos,\nwhich has been helpful to me. \n \nIt's like running a business with a sloppy filing system. It reduces your\npower to be as good as you can be. \n \nI have names for Mankiw’s approach, grabbing whatever you need without\nattribution. Sometimes I call it \"take what you wish,\" and sometimes I call\nit \"Kiplingism.\" And when I call it Kiplingism, I'm reminding you of\nKipling's stanza of poetry', which went something like this: \"When Homer\nsmote his blooming lyre, he'd heard men sing by land and sea, and what he\n\f\nthought he might require, he went and took, the same as me.\" Well, that's\nthe way Mankiw does it. He just grabs. This is much better than not\ngrabbing. But it is much worse than grabbing with full attribution and full\ndiscipline, using all knowledge plus \nextreme reductionism where feasible. \n \n3) Physics Envy \n \nThe third weakness that I find in economics is what I call physics envy. \nAnd, of course, that term has been borrowed from penis envy as described\nby one of the world's great idiots, Sigmund Freud. But he was very popUlar\nin his time, and the concept got a wide vogue. \n \nOne of the worst examples of what physics envy did to e economics was\ncause adoption of hard-form efficient market theory. And then, when you\nlogically derived consequences from this wrong theory, I you would get\nconclusions such as it can never be correct for any corporation to buy its\nown stock. Because the stock price, by definition, is totally efficient, there\ncould never be any advantage. QED. And they taught this theory to some\npartner at McKinsey when he was at some school of business that had\nadopted this crazy line of reasoning from economics, and the partner\nbecame a paid consultant for the Washington Post. And Washington Post\nstock was selling at a fifth of what an orangutan could figure was the plain\nvalue per share by just counting up the values and dividing.

    "raw_text": "Warren Buffett on the board, and he convinced them to buy back more than\nhalf of the outstanding stock, which enriched the remaining shareholders by\nmuch more than a billion dollars. So, there was at least one instance of a\nplace that quickly killed a wrong academic theory. \n \nAnd Washington Post stock was selling at a fifth of what an orangutan\ncould figure was the plain value per share by just counting up the values\nand dividing. \n \nIt's my view that economics could avoid a lot of this trouble that comes\nfrom physics envy. I want economics to pick up the basic ethos of hard\nscience, the full attribution habit, but not the craving for an unattainable\nprecision that comes from physics envy. The sort of precise, reliable\nformula that includes Boltzmann's constant is not going to happen, by and\nlarge, in economics. Economics involves too complex a system. And the\ncraving for that physics-style precision does little but get you in terrible\ntrouble, like the poor fool from McKinsey. \n \nI think that economists would be way better off if they paid more attention\nto Einstein and Sharon Stone. Well, Einstein is easy because Einstein is\nfamous for saying, \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but\nno more simple.\" Now, the saying is a tautology, but it's very useful, and\nsome economist-it may have been Herb Stein-had a similar tautological\nsaying that I dearly love: \"If a thing can't go on forever, it will eventually\nstop.\"\n\f\nSharon Stone contributed to the subject because someone once asked her if\nshe was bothered by penis envy. And she said, \"Absolutely not. I have more\ntrouble than I can handle with what I've got.\" \n \nWhen I talk about this false precision, this great hope for reliable, precise\nformulas, I am reminded of Arthur Laffer, who's in my political party, and\nwho takes a mistaken approach, sometimes, when it comes to doing\neconomics. His trouble is his craving for false precision, which is not an\nadult way of dealing with his subject matter. \n \nEinstein is easy because Einstein is famous for saying, \"Everything should\nbe made as simple as possible, but no more simple. \n \nThe situation of people like Laffer reminds me of a rustic legislator-and this\nreally happened in America. I don't invent these stories. Reality is always\nmore ridiculous than what I'm going to tell you. At any rate, this rustic\nlegislator proposed a new law in his state. He wanted to pass a law rounding\npi to an even 3.2 so it would be easier for the school children to make the\ncomputations. Well, you can say that this is too ridiculous, and it can't be\nfair to liken economics professors like Laffer to a rustic legislator like this. I\nsay I'm under criticizing the professors. At least when this rustic legislator\nrounded pi to an even number, the error was relatively small. But once you\ntry to put a lot of false precision into a complex system like economics, the\nerrors can compound to the point where they're worse than those of the\nMcKinsey partner when he was incompetently advising the Washington"

    "raw_text": "Post. So, economics should emulate physics' basic ethos, but its search for\nprecision in physics-like formulas is almost always wrong in economics. \n \n4) Too Much Emphasis on Macroeconomics \n \nMy fourth criticism is that there's too much emphasis on macroeconomics\nand not enough on microeconomics. I think this is wrong. It's like trying to\nmaster medicine without knowing anatomy and chemistry. Also, the\ndiscipline of microeconomics is a lot of fun. It helps you correctly\nunderstand macroeconomics, and it's a perfect circus to do. In contrast, I\ndon't think macroeconomics people have all that much fun. For one thing,\nthey are often wrong because of extreme complexity in the system they\nwish to understand. \n \nLet me demonstrate the power of microeconomics by solving two\nmicroeconomic problems. One simple and one a little harder. The first\nproblem is this: Berkshire Hathaway just opened a furniture and appliance\nstore in Kansas City, Kansas. At the time Berkshire opened it, the largest\nselling furniture and appliance store in the world was another Berkshire\nHathaway store, selling $350 million worth of goods per year. The new\nstore in a strange city opened up selling at the rate of more than $500\nmillion a year. From the day it opened, the 3,200 spaces in the parking lot\nwere full. The women had to wait outside the ladies restroom because the\narchitects didn't understand biology. It's hugely successful.\n\f\nWell, I've given you the problem. Now, tell me what explains the runaway\nsuccess of this new furniture and appliance store that is outselling\neverything else in the world? Well, let me do it for you. Is this a low-priced\nstore or a high-priced store? It's not going to have a runaway success in a\nstrange city as a high-priced store. That would take time. Number two, if it's\nmoving $500 million worth of furniture through it, it's one hell of a big\nstore, furniture being as bulky as it is. And what does a big store do? It\nprovides a big selection. So what could this possibly be except a low-priced\nstore with a big selection? \n \nBut, you may wonder, why wasn't it done before, preventing its being done\nfirst now? Again, the answer just pops into your head: It costs a fortune to\nopen a store this big. So, nobody's done it before. So, you quickly know the\nanswer. With a few basic concepts, these microeconomic problems that\nseem hard can be solved much as you put a hot knife through butter. I like\nsuch easy ways of thought that are very remunerative. And I suggest that\nyou people should also learn to do microeconomics better. \n \nNow I'll give you a harder problem. There's a tire store chain in the\nNorthwest that has slowly succeeded over fifty years, the Les Schwab tire\nstore chain. It just ground ahead. It started competing with the stores that\nwere owned by the big tire companies that made all the tires, the Goodyears\nand so forth. And, of course, the manufacturers favored their own stores.\nTheir \"tied stores\" had a big cost advantage. Later, Les Schwab rose in\ncompetition with the huge price discounters like Costco and Sam's Club and\nbefore that Sears, Roebuck and so forth. And yet, here is Schwab now, with\n\f\nhundreds of millions of dollars in sales. And here's Les Schwab in his\neighties, with no education, having done the whole thing. How did he do it?\nI don't see a whole lot of people looking like a light bulb has come on. Well,\nlet's think about it with some microeconomic fluency. \n \nIs there some wave that Schwab could have caught? The minute you ask the\nquestion, the answer pops in. The Japanese had a zero position in tires, and\nthey got big. So this guy must have ridden that wave some in the early\ntimes. \nThen, the slow following success has to have some other causes. \n \nLes Schwab (1917-2007) \nLeslie Schwab was born in Bend, Oregon. After service in the Air Cadet\nCorps during World War II, he returned to Oregon and bought OK Rubber\nWelders, a small tire shop that he turned from a $32,000-a-year business\ninto one generating $150,000 annually. In the 1950s, Schwab began\nexpanding his business throughout the Pacific Northwest. Through\ninnovations such as profit sharing, \"supermarket\" product selection, and\nindependence from the tire manufacturing companies, the company now\noperates over three hundred stores with sales exceeding $l billion annually.\nAnd what probably happened here, obviously, is this guy did one hell of a\nlot of things right. And among the things that he must have done right is he\nmust have harnessed what Mankiw calls the superpower of incentives. He\nmust have a very clever incentive structure driving his people. And a clever\npersonnel selection system, etc. And he must be pretty good at advertising.\nWhich he is. He's an artist. So, he had to get a wave in Japanese tire\n\f\ninvasion, the Japanese being as successful as they were. And then a talented\nfanatic had to get a hell of a lot of things right and keep them right with\nclever systems. Again, not that hard of an answer. But what else would be a\nlikely cause of the peculiar success? \n \nHe must have a very clever incentive structure driving his people. And a\nclever personnel selection system, etc. And he must be pretty good at\nadvertising. Which he is. He's an artist. \n \nWe hire business school graduates, and they're no better at these problems\nthan you were. Maybe that's the reason we hire so few of them. \n \nWell, how did I solve those problems? Obviously, I was using a simple\nsearch engine in my mind to go through checklist-style, and I was using\nsome rough algorithms that work pretty well in a great many complex\nsystems, and those algorithms run something like this: Extreme success is\nlikely to be caused by some combination of the following factors: \n \nA) Extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables.\nExample, \nCostco or our furniture and appliance store. \n \nB) Adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success,\noften in \nnonlinear fashion, as one is reminded by the concept of breakpoint and the\nconcept of critical mass in physics. Often results are not linear. You get a\n\f\nlittle bit more mass, and you get a lollapalooza result. And, of course, I've\nbeen searching for lollapalooza results all my life, so I'm very interested in\nmodels chat explain their occurrence. \n \nC) An extreme of good performance over many factors. Example, Toyota or\nLes Schwab. \n \nD) Catching and riding some sort of big wave. Example, Oracle. By the\nway, I cited Oracle before I knew that the Oracle CFO (Jeff Henley) was a\nbig part of the proceedings here today. \n \nGenerally I recommend and use in problem solving cut-to-the quick\nalgorithms, and I find you have to use them both forward and backward. Let\nme give you an example. I irritate my family by giving them little puzzles,\nand one of the puzzles that I gave my family not very long ago was when I\nsaid, \"There's an activity in America, with one-on-one contests and a\nnational championship. The same person won the championship on two\noccasions about sixty-five years apart.\" \"Now,\" I said, \"name the activity.\"\nAgain, I don't see a lot of light bulbs going on. And in my family, not a lot\nof light bulbs were flashing. But I have a physicist son who has been trained\nmore in the type of thinking I like. And he immediately got the right\nanswer, and here's the way he reasoned: \n \nIt can't be anything requiring a lot of hand-eye coordination. Nobody\neighty-five years of age is going to win a national billiards tournament,\nmuch less a national tennis tournament. It just can't be. Then, he figured it\n\f\ncouldn't be chess, which this physicist plays very well, because it's too hard.\nThe complexity of the system and the stamina required are too great. But\nthat led into checkers. And he thought, \"Ah ha! There's a game where vast\nexperience might guide you to be the best even though you're eighty-five\nyears of age.\" \n \nAnd sure enough, that was the right answer. \n \nAnyway, I recommend that sort of mental puzzle solving to all of you,\nflipping one's thinking both backward and forward. And I recommend that\nacademic economics get better at very small-scale microeconomics as\ndemonstrated here. \n \n5) Too Little Synthesis in Economics \n \nMy fifth criticism is there is too little synthesis in economics, not only with\nmatter outside traditional economics, but also within economics. I have\nposed before two different business school classes the following problem. I\nsay, \"You have studied supply and demand curves. You have learned that\nwhen you raise the price, ordinarily, the volume you can sell goes down,\nand when you reduce the price, the volume you can sell goes up. Is that\nright? That's what you've learned?\" They all nod yes. And I say, \"Now tell\nme several instances when, if you want the physical volume to go up, the\ncorrect answer is to increase the price.\" And there's this long and ghastly\npause. And finally, in each of the two business schools in which I've tried\nthis, maybe one person in fifty could name one instance. They come up\n\f\nwith the idea that, under certain circumstances a higher price acts as a rough\nindicator of quality and thereby increases sales volumes. \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Six \n \nQuestion: \"I have posed at two different business schools the following\nproblem. I say, \"You have studied supply and demand curves. You have\nlearned that when you raise the price, ordinarily the volume you can sell\ngoes down, and when you reduce the price, the volume you can sell goes\nup. Is that right? That's what you've learned?\" They all nod yes. And I say,\n\"Now tell me several instances when, if you want the physical volume to go\nup, the correct answer is to increase the price?\" And there's this long and\nghastly pause. And finally, in each of the two business schools in which I've\ntried this, maybe one person in fifty could name one instance' But only one\nin fifty can come up with this sole instance in a modern business school-one\nof the business schools being Stanford, which is hard to get into. And\nnobody has yet come up with the main answer that I like. \" \n \nAnswer: \"There are four categories of answers to this problem. A few\npeople get the first category but rarely any of the others. \n \n1. Luxury goods: Raising the price can improve the product's ability as a\nshow-off item, i.e., by raising the price the utility of the goods is improved\nto someone engaging in conspicuous consumption. Further, people will\nfrequently assume that the high price equates to a better product, and this\ncan sometimes lead to increased sales.\n\f\n2. Non-luxury goods: same as second factor cited above, i.e., the higher\nprice conveys information assumed to be correct by the consumer, that the\nhigher price connotes higher value. This can especially apply to industrial\ngoods where high reliability is an important factor. \n \n3. Raise the price and use the extra revenue in legal ways to make the\nproduct work better or to make the sales system work better. \n \n4. Raise the price and use the extra revenue in illegal or unethical ways to\ndrive sales by the functional equivalent of bribing purchasing agents or in\nother ways detrimental to the end consumer, i.e., mutual fund commission\npractices. [This is the answer I like the most, but never get.] \n \n\"Nothing to Add\" Number Seven \n \nHere is a question that arose concerning the content of Talk Nine: \n \nQuestion: \"You once said you left Mystery defect Number Ten' out of your\nUCSB talk. What was it?\" \n \nAnswer: \"Oh, yes. I should have included it, but I didn't, and I think we\nshould just leave it as it was delivered. The tenth defect is what I call 'Not\nEnough Attention to the Effects of Embedded Ponzi Schemes at the\nMicroeconomic Level.' This is easily demonstrated by the unfunded\n\f\npension plans at the major law firms where a clear and enormous potential\nfuture impact goes unnoticed-and blissfully ignored.\" \n \n\"Now you tell me several instances when, if you want the physical volume\nto go up, the correct Answer is to increase the price?\" \n \nThis happened in the case of my friend, Bill Ballhaus. When he was head of\nBeckman Instruments, it produced some complicated product where, if it\nfailed, it caused enormous damage to the purchaser. It wasn't a pump at the\nbottom of an oil well, true that's a good mental example. And he realized\nthat the reason this thing was selling so poorly, even though it was better\nthan anybody else's product, was because it was priced lower. It made\npeople think it was a low-quality gizmo. So he raised the price by twenty\npercent or so, and the volume went way up. \n \nBut only one in fifty can come up with this sole instance in a modern\nbusiness school-one of the business schools being Stanford, which is hard\nto get into. And nobody has yet come up with the main answer that I like.\n(See the \"I Have Nothing to Add\" feature on page 393 for Charlie's full\nanswers to this question.) Suppose you raise that price and use the extra\nmoney to bribe the other guy's purchasing agent? Is that going co work?\nAnd are there functional equivalents in economics-miseconomics of raising\nthe price and using the extra sales proceeds to drive sales higher? And, of\ncourse, i there are a zillion, once you've made that mental jump. It's so\nsimple.\n\f\nOne of the most extreme examples is in the investment management field.\nSuppose you're the manager of a mutual fund, and you want to sell more.\nPeople commonly come to the following answer: You raise the\ncommissions, which. of course. reduces the number of units of real\ninvestments delivered to the ultimate buyer, so you're increasing the price\nper unit of real investment that you're selling the ultimate customer. And\nyou're using that extra commission to bribe the customer's purchasing\nagent. You're bribing the broker to betray his client and put the client's\nmoney into the high-commission product. This has worked to produce at\nleast a trillion dollars of mutual fund sales. \n \nThe second interesting problem with synthesis involves two of the most\nfamous examples in economics. Number one is Ricardo's principle of\ncomparative advantage in trade, and the other is Adam Smith's pin factory \n \nThis tactic is not an attractive part of human nature, and I want to tell you\nthat I pretty completely avoided it in my life. I don't think it's necessary to\nspend your life selling what you would never buy. Even though it's legal, I\ndon't think it's a good idea. But you shouldn't accept all my notions because\nyou'll risk becoming unemployable. You shouldn't take my notions unless\nyou're willing to risk being \nunemployable by all but a few. \n \nI think my experience with my simple question is an example of how little\nsynthesis people get, even in advanced academic settings, considering\neconomic questions. Obvious questions, with such obvious answers. Yet,\n\f\npeople take four courses in economics, go to business school, have all these\nI.Q. points, and write all these essays, but they can't synthesize worth a\ndamn. This failure is not because the professors know all this stuff and\nthey're deliberately withholding it from the students. This failure happens\nbecause the professors aren't all that good at this kind of synthesis. They\nwere trained in a different way. I can't remember if it was Keynes or\nGalbraith who said that economics professors are most economical with\nideas. They make a few they learned in graduate school last a lifetime. \n \nThe second interesting problem with synthesis involves two of the most\nfamous examples in economics. Number one is Ricardo's principle of\ncomparative advantage in trade, and the other is Adam Smith's pin factory.\nAnd both of these, of course, work to vastly increase economic output per\nperson, and they're similar in that each somehow directs functions into the\nhands of people who are very good at doing the functions. Yet, they're\nradically different examples in that one of them is the ultimate example of\ncentral planning-the pin factory-where the whole system was planned by\nsomebody, while the other example, Ricardo's, happens automatically as a\nnatural consequence of trade. \n \nDavid Ricardo (1772_1823) \nDavid Ricardo, born in London, began working with his father at the\nLondon Stock Exchange at age fourteen. His wealth allowed him to retire\nyoung, and he secured a seat in Parliament. He became interested in\neconomics after reading Adam Smith’s the wealth of Nations and, made\nmany significant contributions to the field. Ricardo is often credited with\n\f\nthe theory of comparative advantage, which explains why it can be\nbeneficial for two countries to trade, even though one of them may be able\nto produce every kind of item more cheaply than the other. The concept was\nfirst described by Robert Torrens in l815 in an essay on the wheat trade, but\nRicardo explained it more clearly in his 1817 book The Principles of\nPolitical Economy and Taxation. \n \nAdam Smith's Pin Factory \nAdam Smith recorded it An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the\nWealth of Nations (1776) his observations at a pin factory. He found that\nonly ten workers were able to produce 48,000 pins per day because of\ndivided and specialized labor. If Each worker handled all the steps required\nto make a pin, he could only make twenty per day, for a total factory output\nof two hundred pins daily. Smith recognized and extolled the great\nproductivity gains and economic progress represented by the pin factory\nand its embrace of specialized labor. \n \nAnd, of course, once you get into the joys of synthesis, you immediately\nthink, \"Do these things interact?\" Of course they interact. Beautifully. And\nthat's one of the causes of the power of a modern economic system. I saw\nan example of that kind of interaction years ago. Berkshire had this former\nsavings and loan company, and it had made this loan on a hotel right\nopposite the Hollywood Park Racetrack. In due time, the neighborhood\nchanged, and it was full of gangs, pimps, and dope dealers. They tore\ncopper pipe out of the wall for dope fixes, and there were people hanging\naround the hotel with guns, and nobody would come. We foreclosed on it\n\f\ntwo or three times, and the loan value went down to nothing. We seemed to\nhave an insolvable economic problem- a microeconomic problem. \n \nNow, we could have gone to McKinsey, or maybe a bunch of professors\nfrom Harvard, and we would have gotten a report about ten inches thick\nabout the ways we could approach this failing hotel in their terrible\nneighborhood. But instead, we put a sign on the property that said: \"For sale\nor rent.\" And in came. in response to chat sign, a man who said, \"I'll spend\n$200,000 fixing up your hotel and buy it at a high price on credit, if you can\nget zoning so I can turn the parking lot into a putting green.\" \"You've got to\nhave a parking lot in a hotel,\" we said. \"What do you have in mind?\" He\nsaid, \"No, my business is flying seniors in from Florida, putting them near\nthe airport, and then letting them go out to Disneyland and various places\nby bus and coming back. And I don't care how bad the neighborhood is\ngoing to be because my people are self-contained behind walls. All they\nhave to do is get on the bus in the morning and come home in the evening,\nand they don't need a parking lot; they need a putting green.\" So we made\nthe deal with the guy. The whole thing worked beautifully, and the loan got\npaid off, and it all worked out. \n \nThe odd system that this guy had designed to Amuse seniors was pare pin\nfactory, and finding the guy with this system was pure Ricardo. \n \nObviously, that's an interaction of Ricardo and the pin factory examples.\nThe odd system that this guy had designed to amuse seniors was pure pin\n\f\nfactory, and finding the guy with this system was pure Ricardo. So these\nthings are interacting. \n \nWell, I've taken you part way through the synthesis. It gets harder when you\nwant to figure out how much activity should be within private firms, and\nhow much should be within the government, and what are the factors that\ndetermine which functions are where, and why do the failures occur, and so\non and so on. \n \nRonald Coase (b. 1910) \nRonald Coase, born in a suburb of London, graduated from secondary\nschool at age twelve and enrolled in the University of London only two\nyears later. He earned degrees in law and economics and began research\ninto transaction costs. He came to the United States in l95l for an academic\ncareer that started at the University of Buffalo. He settled into the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1964 and remains there as professor emeritus. His\nwork, \"The Nature of the Firm' (1937), was cited as a major consideration\nin his receipt of the Nobel Prize in economics in 1991. \n \nIt's my opinion that anybody with a high I.Q. who graduated in economics\nought to be able to sit down and write a ten-page synthesis of all these ideas\nthat's quite persuasive. And I would bet a lot of money that I could give this\ntest in practically every economics department in the country and get a\nperfectly lousy bunch of synthesis. They'd give me Ronald Coase. They'd\ntalk about transaction costs. They'd click off a little something that their\nprofessors gave them and spit it back. But in terms of really understanding\n\f\nhow it all fits together, I would confidently predict that most people couldn't\ndo it very well. \n \nwhy did Max Planck, one of the smartest people who ever lived, give up\neconomics? The answer is, he said, \"It's too hard. The best solution you can\nget is messy and uncertain. \n \nBy the way, if any of you want to try and do this, go ahead. I think you'll\nfind it hard. In this connection, one of the interesting things that I want to\nmention is that Max Planck, the great Nobel laureate who found Planck's\nconstant, tried once to do economics. He gave it up. Now why did Max\nPlanck, one of the smartest people who ever lived, give up economics? The\nanswer is, he said, \"It's too hard. The best solution you can get is messy and\nuncertain.\" It didn't satisfy Planck's craving for order, and so he gave it up.\nAnd if Max Planck early on realized he was never going to get perfect\norder, I will confidently predict that all of the rest of you are going to have\nexactly the same result. \n \nBy the way, there's a famous story about Max Planck that is apocryphal:\nAfter he won his prize, he was invited to lecture everywhere, and he had\nthis chauffeur who drove him around to give public lectures all through\nGermany. And the chauffeur memorized the lecture, and so one day he said,\n\"Gee, Professor Planck, why don't you let me try it by switching places?\"\nAnd so he got up and gave the lecture. At the end of it, some physicist stood\nup and posed a question of extreme difficulty. But the chauffeur was up to\nit. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like\n\f\nMunich is asking so elementary a question, so I'm going to ask my\nchauffeur to respond.\" \n \n6) Extreme and Counterproductive Psychological Ignorance \n \nAll right, I'm down to the sixth main defect, and this is a subdivision of the\nlack of adequate multidisciplinarity: extreme and counterproductive\npsychological ignorance in economics. Here, I want to give you a very\nsimple problem. I specialize in simple problems. \n \nYou own a small casino in Las Vegas. It has fifty standard slot machines.\nIdentical in appearance, they're identical in the function. They have exactly\nthe same payout ratios. The things that cause the payouts are exactly the\nsame. They occur in the same percentages. But there's one machine in this\ngroup of slot machines that, no matter where you put it among the fifty, in\nfairly short order, when you go to the machines at the end of the day, there\nwill be twenty-five percent more winnings from this one machine than from\nany other machine. Now surely, I'm not going to have a failure here. What\nis different about that heavy-winning machine? Can anybody do it? \n \nMale: More people play it. \n \nMunger: No, no, I want to know why more people play it. What's different\nabout that machine is people have used modern electronics to give a higher\nratio of near misses. That machine is going bar, bar, lemon, bar, bar,\n\f\ngrapefruit, way more often than normal machines, and that will cause\nheavier play. \nHow do you get an answer like that? Easy. Obviously, there's a\npsychological cause: That machine is doing something to trigger some basic\npsychological response. \n \nIf you know the psychological factors, if you've got them on a checklist in\nyour head, you just run down the factors, and, boom! you get to one that\nmust explain this occurrence. There isn't any other way to do it effectively.\nThese answers are not going to come to people who don't learn these\nproblem-solving methods. If you want to go through life like a one-legged\nman in an ass-kicking contest, why, be my guest. But if you want to succeed\nlike a strong man with two legs, you have to pick up these methods,\nincluding doing micro- and macro-economics while knowing psychology. \n \nIn this vein, I next want to mention a strange Latin American case of a\ndysfunctional economy that got fixed. In this little subdivision of Latin\nAmerica, a culture had arisen wherein everybody stole everything. They\nembezzled from the company; they stole everything that was loose in the\ncommunity. And, of course, the economy came practically to a halt. And\nthis thing got fixed. Now, where did I read about this case? I'll give you a\nhint. It wasn't in the annals of economics. I found this case in the annals of\npsychology. Clever people went down and used a bunch of psychological\ntricks. And they fixed it."

He said, in substance, that if an academic maintains in\nplace an ignorance that can be easily removed with a little work, the\nconduct of the academic amounts to treachery. 'that was his word,\n\"treachery.\" You can see why I love this stuff. He saves you have a duty if\nyou're an academic to be as little of a klutz as you can possibly be, and,\ntherefore, you have gotta keep grinding out of your system as much\nremovable ignorance as you can remove. \n \n7) Too Little Attention to Second- and Higher-Order EfFects \n \nOnto the next one, the seventh defect: too little attention in economics to\nsecond-order and even higher-order effects. This defect is quite\nunderstandable because the consequences have consequences, and the\nconsequences of the consequences have consequences, and so on. It gets\nvery complicated. When I was a meteorologist, I found this stuff very\nirritating. And economics makes meteorology look like a tea party.\n\f\nExtreme economic ignorance was displayed when various experts,\nincluding Ph. D. economists, forecast the cost of the original Medicare law.\nThey did simple extrapolations of past costs. \n \nWell, the cost forecast was off by a factor of more than one thousand\npercent. The cost they projected was less than ten percent of the cost that\nhappened. Once they put in place various new incentives, the behavior\nchanged in response to the incentives, and the numbers became quite\ndifferent from their projection. And medicine invented new and expensive\nremedies, as it was sure to do. How could a great group of experts make\nsuch a silly forecast? Answer: They oversimplified to get easy figures, like\nthe rube rounding pi to 3.11. They chose not to consider effects of effects on\neffects. and so on. \n \nOne good thing about this common form of misthinking from the viewpoint\nof academia is that business people are even more foolish about\nmicroeconomics. The business version of the Medicare-type insanity is\nwhen you own a textile plant and a guy comes in and says, \"Oh, isn't this\nwonderful They invented a new loom. It'll pay for itself in three years at\ncurrent prices because it adds so much efficiency to the production of\ntextiles.\" And you keep buying these looms, and their equivalent, for twenty\nyears, and you keep making four percent on capital; you never go\nanywhere. And the answer is, it wasn't that technology didn't work, it's that\nthe laws of economics caused the benefit from the new looms to go to the\npeople that bought the textiles, not the guy that owned the textile plant.\nHow could anybody not know that if he'd take n freshman economics or\n\f\nbeen through business school? I think the schools are doing a lousy job.\nOtherwise, such insanities wouldn't happen so often. \n \nUsually, I don't use formal projections. I don't let people do them for me\nbecause I don't like throwing up on the desk, but I see them made in a very\nfoolish way all the time, and many people believe in them, no matter how\nfoolish they are. It's an effective sales technique in America to put a foolish\nprojection on a desk. \n \nAnd if you're an investment banker, it's an arr form. I don't read their\nprojections either. Once Warren and I bought a company, and the seller had\na big study done by an investment banker. It was about this thick. We just\nturned it over as if it were a diseased carcass. He said, \"We paid $2 million\nfor that.\" I said, \"We don't use them. Never look at them.\" \n \nAnyway, as the Medicare example showed, all human systems are gamed,\nfor reasons rooted deeply in psychology, and great skill is displayed in the\ngaming because game theory has so much potential. That's what's wrong\nwith the workers' comp system in California. Gaming has been raised to an\nart form. In the course of gaming the system, people learn to be crooked. Is\nthis good for civilization? Is it good for economic performance? Hell, no.\nThe people who design easily gameable systems belong in the lowest circle\nof hell. \n \nThey just don't think about what terrible things they're doing to the\ncivilization because they don't take into account the second-order effects\n\f\nand the third-order effects in lying and cheating. \n \nI've got a friend whose family controls about eight percent of the truck\ntrailer market. He just closed his last factory in California, and he had one\nin Texas that was even worse. The workers comp cost in his Texas plant got\nto be double digit percentages of payroll. Well, there's no such profit in\nmaking truck trailers. He closed his plant and moved it to Ogden, Utah,\nwhere a bunch of believing Mormons are raising big families and don't\ngame the workers' comp system. The workers' comp expense is two percent\nof payroll. \n \nAre the Latinos who were peopling his plant in Texas intrinsically dishonest\nor bad compared to the Mormons No. It's just the incentive structure that so\nrewards all this fraud is put in place by these ignorant legislatures, many\nmembers of which have been to law school, and they just don't think about\nwhat terrible things they're doing to the civilization because they don't take\ninto account the second order effects and the third-order effects in lying and\ncheating. So, this happens everywhere, and when economics is full of it, it\nis just like the rest of life. \n \nThere was a wonderful example of gaming a human system in the career of\nVictor Niederhoffer in the Economics Department of Harvard. Victor\nNiederhoffer was the son of a police lieutenant, and he needed to get A's at\nHarvard. But he didn't want to do any serious work at Harvard because\nwhat he really liked doing was, one, playing world-class checkers; two,\ngambling in high-stakes card games, at which he was very good, all hours"

    "raw_text": "of the day and night; three, being the squash champion of the United States,\nwhich he was for years; and, four, being about as good a tennis player as a\npart-time tennis player could be. \n \nThis did not leave much time for getting A's at Harvard, so he went into the\nEconomics Department. You'd think he would have chosen French poetry.\nBut remember, this was a guy who could play championship checkers. He\nthought he was up to outsmarting the Harvard Economics Department. And\nhe was. He noticed that the graduate students did most of the boring work\nthat would otherwise go to the professors, and he noticed that because it\nwas so hard to get to be a graduate student at Harvard, they were all very\nbrilliant and organized and hardworking, as well as much needed by\ngrateful professors. \n \nAnd, therefore, by custom, and as would be predicted from the\npsychological force called \"reciprocity tendency,\" in a really advanced\ngraduate course, the professors always gave an A. So Victor Niederhoffer\nsigned up for nothing but the most advanced graduate courses in the\nHarvard Economics Department, and, of course, he got A, after A, after A,\nafter A, and was hardly ever near a class. And, for a while, some people at\nHarvard may have thought it had a new prodigy on its hands. That's a\nridiculous story, but the scheme will work still. And Niederhoffer is\nfamous: They call his style \"Niederhoffering the curriculum.\" \n \nThis shows how all human systems are gamed. Another example of not\nthinking through the consequences of the consequences is the standard\n\f\nreaction in economics to Ricardo's law of comparative advantage giving\nbenefit on both sides of trade. Ricardo came up with a wonderful, non-\nobvious explanation that was so powerful that people were charmed with it,\nand they still are because it's a very useful idea. Everybody in economics\nunderstands that comparative advantage is a big deal when one considers\nfirst-order advantages in trade from the Ricardo effect. But suppose you've\ngot a very talented ethnic group, like the Chinese, and they're very poor and\nbackward, and you're an advanced nation, and you create free trade with\nChina, and it goes on for a long time. \n \nNow let's follow second- and third-order consequences. You are more\nprosperous than you would have been if you hadn't traded with China in\nterms of average wellbeing in the United States, right? Ricardo proved it.\nBut which nation is going to be growing faster in economic terms? It's\nobviously China. They're absorbing all the modern technology of the world\nthrough this great facilitator in free trade, and, like the Asian Tigers have\nproved, they will get ahead fast. Look at Hong Kong. Look at Taiwan. Look\nat early Japan. So, you start in a place where you've got a weak nation of\nbackward peasants, a billion and a quarter of them, and, in the end, they're\ngoing to be a much bigger, stronger nation than you are, maybe even having\nmore and better atomic bombs. Well, Ricardo did not prove that that's a\nwonderful outcome for the former leading nation. He didn't try to determine\nsecond-order and higher-order effects. \n \nComparative Advantage\n\f\nThe often overlooked benefits of comparative advantage through free trade\nwere famously revealed by David ricardo in his 1817 book The Principles\nof Political Economy and Taxation: \n\"In Portugal it is possible to produce both wine and cloth with less work\nthan it takes in England. However, the relative costs of producing those two\ngoods are different in the two countries. In England it is very hard to\nproduce wine, but only moderately difficult to produce cloth. In Portugal\nboth are easy to produce. Therefore, while it is cheaper to produce cloth in\nPortugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess\nwine, and trade it for English cloth. Conversely, England benefits from this\ntrade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now\nget wine at closer to the cost of cloth\". \nFrequently overlooked is that Ricardo's comparative advantage in\n\"delegating\" tasks among nations is equally applicable for managers\ndelegating work. Even if a manager can perform the full range of tasks\nbetter himself, it is still mutually advantageous to divide them up. \n \nIf you try and talk like this to economics professors, and I've done this three\ntimes, they shrink in horror and offense because they don't like this kind of\ntalk. It really gums up this nice discipline of theirs, which is so much\nsimpler when you ignore second- and third-order consequences. The best\nanswer I ever got on that subject-in three tries-was from George Shultz. He\nsaid, \"Charlie, the way I figure it is if we stop trading with China, the other\nadvanced nations will do it anyway, and we wouldn't stop the ascent of\nChina compared to us, and we'd lose the Ricardo-diagnosed advantages of\ntrade.\" Which is obviously correct. And I said, \"We11, George, you've just\n\f\ninvented a new form of the tragedy of the commons. You're locked in this\nsystem, and you can't fix it. You're going to go to a tragic hell in a\nhandbasket, if going to hell involves being once the great leader of the\nworld and finally going to the shallows in terms of leadership.\" And he\nsaid, \"Charlie, I do not want to think about this.\" I think he's wise. He's even\nolder than I am, and maybe I should learn from him. \n \n8) Not Enough Attention to the Concept of Febezzlement \n \nOkay, I'm now down to my eighth objection: too little attention within\neconomics to the simplest and most fundamental principle of algebra. Now,\nthis sounds outrageous, that economics doesn't do algebra, right? Well, I\nwant to try an example-I may be wrong on this. I'm old and I'm\niconoclastic-but I throw it out anyway. I say that economics doesn't pay\nenough attention to the concept of febezzlement. And that I derive from\nGalbraith's idea. Galbraith's idea was that, if you have an undisclosed\nembezzlement, it has a wonderful Keynesian stimulating effect on the\neconomy because the guy who's been embezzled thinks he is as rich as he\nalways was and spends accordingly, and the guy that has stolen the money\ngets all this new purchasing power. I think that's correct analysis on\nGalbraith's part. The trouble with his notion is that he's described a minor\nphenomenon. Because when the embezzlement is discovered, as it almost\nsurely will be, the effect will quickly reverse. So the effect quickly cancels\nout.\n\f\nBut suppose you paid a lot of attention to algebra, which I guess Galbraith\ndidn't, and you think, \"Well, the fundamental principle of algebra is, 'If A is\nequal to B and B is equal to C, then A is equal to C.\"' You've then got a\nfundamental principle that demands that you look for functional\nequivalents, all you can find. So suppose you ask the question, \"Is there\nsuch a thing in economics as a febezzlement?\" By the way, Galbraith\ninvented the word \"bezzle\" to describe the amount of undisclosed\nembezzlement, so I invented the word \"febezzlement\": the functional\nequivalent of embezzlement. \n \nThis happened after I asked the question, \"Is there a functional equivalent\nof embezzlement?\" I came up with a lot of wonderful, affirmative answers.\nSome were in investment management. After all, I'm near investment\nmanagement. I considered the billions of dollars totally wasted in the course\nof investing common stock portfolios for American owners. As long as the\nmarket keeps going up, the guy who's wasting all this money doesn't feel it\nbecause he's looking at these steadily rising values. And to the guy who is\ngetting the money for investment advice, the money looks like well earned\nincome when he's really selling detriment for money, surely the functional\nequivalent of undisclosed embezzlement. You can see why I don't get\ninvited to many lectures. \n \nSo I say, if you look in the economy for febezzlement, the functional\nequivalent of embezzlement, you'11 find some enormously powerful\nfactors. They create some \"wealth effect\" that is on steroids compared to the\nold \"wealth effect.\" But practically nobody thinks as I do, and I quitclaim"

    "raw_text": "my idea to any hungry graduate student who has independent means, which\nhe will need before his thesis topic is approved. \n \n9) Not Enough Attention to Virtue and Vice Effects \n \nOkay, my ninth objection: not enough attention to virtue and vice effects in\neconomics. It has been plain to me since early life that there are enormous\nvirtue effects in economics and also enormous vice effects. But economists\nget very uncomfortable when you talk about virtue and vice. It doesn't lend\nitself to a lot of columns of numbers. But, I would argue that there are big\nvirtue effects in economics. I would say that the spreading of double-entry\nbookkeeping by the monk, Fra Luca de Pacioli, was a big virtue effect in\neconomics. It made business more controllable, and it made it more honest.\nThen, the cash register. The cash register did more for human morality than\nthe Congregational Church. It was a really powerful phenomenon to make\nan economic system work better, just as, in reverse, a system that can be\neasily defrauded ruins a civilization. A system that's very hard to defraud,\nlike a cash register-based system, helps the economic performance of a\ncivilization by reducing vice, but very few people within economics talk\nabout it in those terms. \n \nI'll go further: I say economic systems work better when there's an extreme\nreliability ethos. And the traditional way to get a reliability ethos, at least in\npast generations in America, was through religion. The religions instilled\nguilt. We have a charming Irish Catholic priest in our neighborhood, and he\nloves to say, \"Those old Jews may have invented guilt, but we perfected it.\"\n\f\nAnd this guilt, derived from religion, has been a huge driver of a reliability\nethos, which has been very helpful to economic outcomes for man. \n \nBut economists get very uncomfortable when you talk about virtue and\nvice. It doesn't lend itself to a lot of columns of numbers. \n \nMany bad effects from vice are clear. You've got the crazy booms and\ncrooked promotions-all you have to do is read the paper over the last six\nmonths. There's enough vice to make us all choke. And, by the way,\neverybody's angry about unfair compensation at the top of American\ncorporations, and people should be. We now face various crazy governance\nnostrums invented by lawyers and professors that won't give us a fix for\nunfair compensation, yet a good partial solution is obvious: If directors\nwere significant shareholders who got a pay of zero, you'd be amazed what\nwould happen to unfair compensation of corporate executives as we\ndampened effects from reciprocity tendency. \n \nA roughly similar equivalent of this no-pay system has been tried in a\nstrange place. In England, \nlay magistrates staff the lower criminal courts, which can send you to prison\nfor a year or fine you substantially. You've got three judges sitting up there,\nand they all get a pay of zero. Their expenses are reimbursed, but not too\nliberally. And they work about forty half-days a year, as volunteers. It's\nworked beautifully for about seven hundred years. Able and honest people\ncompete to become magistrates, to perform the duty and get the\nsignificance, but no pay.\n\f\nThis is the system Benjamin Franklin, near the end of his life, wanted for\nthe U.S. government. He didn't want the high executives of government to\nbe paid, but to be like himself or the entirely unpaid, well-off ministers and\nrulers of the Mormon Church. And when I see what's happened in\nCalifornia, I'm not sure he wasn't right. At any rate, no one now drifts in\nFranklin's direction. For one thing, professors-and most of them need\nmoney-get appointed directors. \n \nIt is not always recognized that, to function best morality should sometimes\nappear unfair, like most worldly outcomes. The craving for perfect fairness\ncauses a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systems should\nbe made deliberately unfair to individuals because they'll be fairer on\naverage for all of us. Thus, there can be virtue in apparent non-fairness. I\nfrequently cite the example of having your career over, in the Navy, if your\nship goes aground, even if it wasn't your fault. I say the lack of justice for\nthe one guy that wasn't at fault is way more than made up by a greater\njustice for everybody when every captain of a ship always sweats blood to\nmake sure the ship doesn't go aground. Tolerating a little unfairness to some\nto get a greater fairness for all is a model I recommend to all of you. But\nagain, I wouldn't put it in your assigned college work if you want to be\ngraded well, particularly in a modern law \nschool wherein there is usually an over-love of fairness-seeking process. \n \nThere are, of course, enormous vice effects in economics. You have these\nbubbles with so much fraud and folly. The aftermath is frequently very\n\f\nunpleasant, and we've had some of that lately. One of the first big bubbles,\nof course, was the huge and horrible South Sea Bubble in England. And the\naftermath was interesting. Many of you probably don't remember what\nhappened after the South Sea Bubble, which caused an enormous financial\ncontraction and a lot of pain. Except in certain rare cases, they banned\npublicly traded stock in England for decades. Parliament passed a law that\nsaid you can have a partnership with a few partners, but you can't have\npublicly-traded stock. And, by the way, England continued to grow without\npublicly-traded stock. The people who are in the business of prospering\nbecause there's a lot of stock being traded in casino-like frenzy wouldn't\nlike this example if they studied it enough. It didn't ruin England to have a\nlong period when they didn't have publicly-traded shares. \n \nJust as in real estate. We had all the shopping centers and auto dealerships,\nand so on, we needed for years when we didn't have publicly-traded real\nestate shares. \nIt's a myth that once you've got some capital market, economic\nconsiderations demand that it has to \nbe as fast and efficient as a casino. It doesn't. \n \nThe South Sea Bubble \nThe South Sea Bubble was an economic frenzy in England that occurred\nwhen speculation in South Sea Company shares peaked spring 1720. The\nshare price rose from $128 in January to a high of $l,000 in August, and\nthen fell back to $l50 in September."

When results ultimately proved skimpy, the company engineered\na public debt scheme that appeared to bolster profits. Company leaders and\nother shareholders also talked up future revenues, causing the speculative\nfrenzy. Public outcry following disclosure of the fraud led to imposition of\nthe Bubble Act of 1720, requiring publicly-traded companies to have a\nroyal charter. \n \nAnother \ninteresting problem is raised by vice effects involving envy. Envy wisely\ngot a very strong condemnation in the laws of Moses. You remember how\nthey laid it on with a trowel: You couldn't covet thy neighbor's ass, you\ncouldn't cover thy neighbor's servant girl, you couldn't covet.... Those old\nJews knew how envious people are and how much trouble it caused. They\nreally laid it on hard, and they were right. But Mandeville-remember his\nfable of bees? He demonstrated convincingly-to me, anyway-that envy was\na great driver of proclivity to spend. And so, here's this terrible vice, which\nis forbidden in the Ten Commandments, and here it's driving all these\nfavorable results in economics. There's some paradox in economics that\nnobody's going to get out. \n \nWhen I was young, everybody was excited by Gödel, who came up with\nproof that you couldn't have a mathematical system without a lot of\nirritating incompleteness in it. Well, since then, my betters tell me that\nthey've come up with more irremovable defects in mathematics and have\ndecided that you're never going to get mathematics without some paradox in\n\f\nit. No matter how hard you work, you're going to have to live with some\nparadox if you're a mathematician. \n \nWell, if the mathematicians can't get the paradox our of their system when\nthey're creating it themselves, the poor economists are never going to get rid\nof paradoxes, nor are any of the rest of us. It doesn't matter. Life is\ninteresting with some paradox. When I run into a paradox, I think either I'm\na total horse's ass to have gotten to this point, or I'm fruitfully near the edge\nof my discipline. It adds excitement to life to wonder which it is. \n \nAs I conclude, I want to tell one more story demonstrating how awful it is\nto get a wrong idea from a limited repertoire and just stick to it. And this is\nthe story of Hyman Liebowitz, who came to America from the old country.\nIn the new country as in the old, he cried to make his way in the family\ntrade, which was manufacturing nails. And he struggled, and he struggled,\nand, finally, his little nail business got to vast prosperity, and his wife said\nto him, \"You are old, Hyman, it's time to go to Florida and turn the business\nover to our son.\" \n \nIn his 1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning book Douglas Hofstadter ties together\nthe work of mathematician Gödel, graphic artist Escher, and composer\nBach \n \nSo down he went to Florida, turning his business over to the son, but he got\nweekly financial reports. And he hadn't been in Florida very long before\nthey turned sharply negative. In fact, they were terrible. So he got on an\n\f\nairplane, and he went back to New Jersey where the factory was. As he left\nthe airport on the way to the factory, he saw this enormous outdoor\nadvertising sign lighted up. And there was Jesus, spread out on the cross.\nAnd under it was a big legend, \"They Used Leibowitz's Nails.\" So he\nstormed into the factory and said, \"You dumb son! What do you think\nyou're doing? It took me fifty years to create this business!\" \"Papa,\" he said.\n\"trust me. I will fix it.\" \n \nSo back he went to Florida, and while he was in Florida, he got more\nreports, and the results kept getting worse. So he got on the airplane again.\nLeft the airport, drove by the sign, looked up at this big lighted sign, and\nnow there's a vacant cross. And, lo and behold, Jesus is crumpled on the\nground under the cross, and the sign said, \"They Didn't Use Leibowitz's\nNails.\" \n \nWell, you can laugh at that. It is ridiculous, but it's no more ridiculous than\nthe way a lot of people cling to failed ideas. Keynes said, \"It's not bringing\nin the new ideas that's so hard. It's getting rid of the old ones.\" And Einstein\nsaid it better, attributing his mental success to \"curiosity, concentration,\nperseverance, and self-criticism.\" By self-criticism, he meant becoming\ngood at destroying your own best-loved and hardest-won ideas. If you can\nget really good at destroying your own wrong ideas, that is a great gift. \n \nWell, it's time to repeat the big lesson in this little talk. What I've urged is\nthe use of a bigger multidisciplinary bag of tricks, mastered to fluency, to\nhelp economics and everything else. And I also urged that people not be"

If\nyou skillfully follow the multidisciplinary path, you will never wish to\ncome back. It would be like cutting off your hands. \n \nBernard de Mandeville (1670-1733) and \"The Fable of the Bees\" \nBernard de Mandeville, philosopher and satirist, published a poem, \"The\nFable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits,\" in 1705 as a political\nsatire.

He generally avoids certain subjects before\nelections; and that is what I am going to do here \n \nCalifornia's Proposition I 3 \nIn 1978, nearly two-thirds of California voters passed Proposition 13, which\nlimits property taxes to one percent of a property's market value, and to two\n\f\npercent per year any increase in the property valuation assessment unless\nthe property is sold. Prior to Proposition 13, there were no real limits on\nincreases either for the tax rate or property value assessments in the state of\nCalifornia. Prop 13 set the stage for a broader taxpayer revolt\" that\ncontributed to Ronald Reagan's election as president in 1980. \nIn the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Arnold\nSchwarzenegger was elected, Schwarzenegger advisor Warren Buffett\nsuggested that Proposition 13, still very popular with many homeowners, be\nrepealed or changed to help balance the state's budget. Politically, Buffett\nsuggestion proved to be highly charged. Below is Schwarzenegger\nreaction. \n \n\"Warren, if you mention Prop Thirteen one more time, you owe me five\nhundred sit-ups.\" \n \nTalk Nine Revisited \n \nThis waggish talk on economics, given in 2003, gave me pleasure as I put it\ntogether. But I hope it provided more than harmless fun. I even hope that\nsome shred of my ideas eventually gets into academic economics, not\nbecause I want recognition, but because I think academic economics needs\nsome \nimprovement. \n \nSince the talk was given, I came across a book, published by Alfred A.\nKnopf in 2005. It was written by a distinguished Harvard economics\n\f\nprofessor, Benjamin M. Friedman, and dealt with the interplay of\neconomics and morals, much as I wished in my talk. The title of this book is\n\"The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.\" As readers will note from\nthe title. Professor Friedman is particularly interested in the impact of\neconomic growth on morals, whereas my interest is mostly in the reverse\ndirection, the impact of morals on economic growth. This difference is not a\nbig deal, because every educated person can see reciprocal effects, for good\nor ill, between the two factors, creating what is often called either a\n\"virtuous circle\" or \"vicious circle.\" Professor Friedman supplies a\nmarvelous quotation on this subject from Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah:\n\"Where there is no bread, there is no law; where there is no law, there is no\nbread.\" \n \nA Matter of Trust \n \n\"Capitalism works best when there is trust in the system.\" \n-Munger \n \nArguably the most important theme in this book is the need for trust:\ndeserved reliance upon the character, values and integrity of those you live\nand work with. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett are renowned for their\nsteadfast commitment to unblemished integrity-believing, like Elbert Gary\n(Chairman of US Steel from 1901 to 7927) that, \"Ethical practices aren't\ngood because they pay; they pay because they are good.\""

    "raw_text": "Charlie recalls a meeting of the \"Ben Graham Group\" in San Diego many\nyears ago. Ben Graham gave his brilliant followers a \"cognitive assessment\ntest!,\" containing some extremely tricky questions. As Ben anticipated, the\nrest takers did not fare well, allowing him to deliver a vital lesson regarding\nthe \nfundamental importance of trust: \n \n\"No matter how smart you are, there are smart people out there who can\nfool you if they really want to. So, be sure you can trust the smart people\nyou work with.\" \n \nOn a warm late-spring day in 2000, Charlie Addressed l94 Juris Doctorate,\n89 Master of  Law, and three \nMaster of Comparative Laws recipients in the University of Southern\nCalifornia's Alumni Park. He offered insights into the practices that have\ncontributed to his success and to his standing as one of the wealthiest\npeople in the world. He observed that the acquisition of wisdom is a moral\nduty and stressed that, while attending law school, he realized the Last road\nto success in life and learning would be a multi-disciplinary one. Following\nthe audience's enthusiastic reaction to this speech, USC Law Dean Edward\nJ.mcCaffery awarded Charlie \"honorary\" admission into The Order of the\nCoif-, a scholastic society founded to encourage excellence in legal\neducation. \n \nTalk Ten\n\f\nUSC Gould School of Law\nCommencement Address \nThe university of Southern California May 13, 2007 \n \nWell, no doubt many of you why this speaker is so old. the answer is\nobvious: He hasn't died yet. why was this speaker chosen? Well, I don't\nknow that. development department had nothing to do with it. \n \nWhatever the reason, I think it's fitting that I'm speaking here because I see\na crowd of older people in the rear, not wearing robes. And I know from\nhaving educated an army of descendants, who it is that really deserves a lot\nof the honors that are being given today to the robe-wearing students in\nfront. The sacrifices, and the wisdom, and the value transfer, that come\nfrom one generation to the next should always be appreciated. I also take\npleasure from the sea of Asian faces to my left. All my life I have admired\nConfucius. I like the idea of \"filial piety,\" of ideas or values that are taught\nand duties that come naturally, that should be passed onto the next\ngeneration. You people who don't think there's anything in this idea, please\nnote how fast Asian people are rising in American life. I think they have\nsomething. \n \nConfucius (551479 BC) on Filial Piety \nIn Confucian thought, filial piety-a love and respect for one's parents and\nancestors-is a virtue to be cultivated. More broadly, \"filial piety means to\ntake care of ones parents; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support;\n\f\ndisplay courtesy; ensure male heirs; uphold fraternity among brothers;\nwisely advise ones parents; conceal their mistakes; display sorrow for their\nsickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death. \n \nConfucius believed that if people could learn to fulfill their filial roles\nproperly they would be better able to perform their roles in society and\ngovernment. To Confucius, filial piety was so essential he felt it\ntranscended the law In fact, during parts of the Han Dynasty those who\nneglected ancestor worship according to filial piety precepts were subject to\ncorporal punishment. \n \nAll right, I've scratched out a few notes, and I'm going to try and give an\naccount of certain ideas and attitudes that have worked well for me. I don't\nclaim that they're perfect for everybody. But I think many of them contain\nuniversal values and that manY of them are \"can't fail\" ideas. \n \nWhat are the core ideas that helped me? Well, luckily I had the idea at a\nvery early age that the safest way to try to get what you want is to try to\ndeserve what you want. It's such a simple idea. It's the golden rule. You\nwant to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other\nend. There is no ethos in my opinion that is better for any lawyer or any\nother person to have. By and large, the people who've had this ethos win in\nlife, and they don't win just money and honors. They win the respect, the\ndeserved trust of the people they deal with. And there is huge pleasure in\nlife to be obtained from getting deserved trust.\n\f\nYou want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the\nother end. \n \nNow, occasionally, you will find a perfect rogue of a person who dies rich\nand widely known. But mostly these people are fully understood as\ndespicable by the surrounding civilization. If the Cathedral is full of people\nat the funeral ceremony, most of them are there to celebrate the fact that the\nperson is dead. That reminds me of the story of the time when one of these\npeople died, and the Minister said, \"It's now time to say something nice\nabout the deceased.\" And nobody came forward, and nobody came forward,\nand nobody came forward. And finally one man came up and said, \"Well,\nhis brother was worse.\" (Audience laughs.) That is not where you want to\ngo. A life ending in such a funeral is not the life you want to have. \n \nThe second idea that I developed very early is that there is no love that is so\nright as admiration-based love, and such love should include the instructive\ndead. Somehow I picked up that idea, and I've lived with it all my life. It's\nbeen very useful to me. A love like that described by Somerset Maugham in\nhis book, Of Human Bondage, is a sick kind of love. It's a disease, and if\nyou find yourself with a disease like that. you should eliminate it. \n \nAnother idea, and this may remind you of Confucius, too, is that the\nacquisition of wisdom is a moral duty. It's not something you do jUst to\nadvance in life. And there's a corollary to that idea that is very important. it\nrequires that you are hooked on lifetime learning. Without lifetime learning,\nyou people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far\n\f\nin life based on what you already know. You're going to advance in life by\nwhat you learn after you leave here. \n \nA sick kind of love \n \nOf Human Bondage, William Somerset Maugham’s autobiographical 1915\nnovel, is generally considered his masterpiece. The protagonist, Philip,\nmeets Mildred, a London waitress, who snubs him. Falling in obsessive\nlove with Mildred, Philip knows he is foolish and despises himself. He\ngives Mildred all his money; she repays him with disgust and humiliation.\nMaugham describes the relationship: \n\"Love was like a parasite in his legs nourishing a hateful existence on his\nlife's blood; it absorbed his existence so intensely that he could take\npleasure in nothing else.\" \n \n...the acquisition of wisdom is a moral duty. \n \nConsider Berkshire Hathaway', one of the best-regarded corporations in the\nworld. It may have the best long-term. big-assets-involving investment\nrecord in the history of civilization. the skill that got Berkshire through one\ndecade would not have sufficed to get it through the next decade, with\ncomparable levels of achievement. Warren Buffett had to be a continuous-\nlearning machine. The same requirement exists in lower walks of life. I\nconstantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not\neven the most diligent. But they are learning machines. They go to bed\n\f\nevery night a little wiser than they were that morning. And boy, does that\nhabit help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you. \n \nAlfred North Whitehead correctly said at one time that the rapid advance of\ncivilization came only when man \"invented the method of invention.\" He\nwas referring to the huge growth in GDP per capita and many other good\nthings we now take for granted. Big-time progress started a few hundred\nyears ago. Before that progress per century was almost nil. Just as\ncivilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you\ncan progress only when you learn the method of learning. \n \nJust as civilization can progress only when it invents the method of\ninvention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning. \n \nI was very lucky. I came to law school having learned the method of\nlearning, and nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous\nlearning. Consider Warren Buffett again. If you watched him with a time\nclock, you'd find that about half of his waking time is spent reading. Then a\nbig chunk of the rest of his time is spent talking one-on-one, either on the\ntelephone or personally, with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who\ntrust him. Viewed up close, Warren looks quite academic as he achieves\nworldly success. \n \nAcademia has many wonderful values in it. I came across an example not\ntoo long ago. In my capacity as a hospital board chairman, I was dealing\nwith a medical school academic named Joseph M. Mirra, M.D. This man,\n\f\nover years of disciplined work, made himself know more about bone tumor\npathology than almost anyone else in the world. He wanted to pass this\nknowledge on to help treat bone cancer. How was he going to do it? Well.\nhe decided to write a textbook, and even though I don't think a textbook like\nthis sells more than a few thousand copies. they do end up in cancer\ntreatment centers all over the world. He took a sabbatical year and sat down\nat his computer with all his slides, carefully saved and organized. He\nworked seventeen hours a day, seven days a week, for a year. Some\nsabbatical. At the end of the year he had created one of the two great bone\ntumor pathology textbooks of the world. When you're around values like\nMirra's, you want to pick up as much as you can. \n \nAnother idea that was hugely useful to me was one I obtained when I\nlistened in law school when some waggish professor said, \"A legal mind is\na mind that considers it feasible and useful, when two things are all twisted\nup together and interacting, to try to think about one thing without\nconsidering the other.\" Well, I could see from that indirectly pejorative\nsentence that any such \"legal\" approach was ridiculous. And this pushed me\nfurther along in my natural drift, which was coward learning all the big\nideas in all the big disciplines, so I wouldn't be the perfect damn fool the\nprofessor described. And because the really big ideas carry about 95% of\nthe freight, it wasn't at all hard for me to pick up about 95% of what I\nneeded from all the disciplines and to include use of this knowledge as a\nstandard part of my mental roudnes. Once you have the ideas, of course,\nyou must continuously practice their use. Like a concert pianist, if you don't\n\f\npractice you can't perform well. So I went through life constantly practicing\na multi-disciplinary approach. \n \nWell, this habit has done a lot for me. It's made life more fun. It's made me\nmore constructive. It's made me more helpful to others. It's made me richer\nthan can be explained by any genetic gifts. My mental routine, properly\npracticed, really helps. Now; there are dangers in it, because it works so\nwell. If you use it you will frequently find when you're with some expert\nfrom another discipline-maybe even an expert who is your employer with a\nvast ability to harm you-that you know more than ' he does about fitting his\nspecialty to the problem at hand. You'll sometimes see the correct answer\nwhen he's missed it. That is a very dangerous position to be in. You can\ncause enormous offense by being right in a way that causes somebody else\nto lose face in his own discipline or hierarchy. I never found the perfect way\nto avoid harm from this serious problem. \n \nYou can cause enormous offense by being right in a way that causes\nsomebody else to lose face in his own discipline or hierarchy.. \n \nEven though I was a good poker player when I was young, I was not good\nenough at pretending when I thought I knew more than my supervisors did.\nAnd I didn't try as hard at pretending as would have been prudent. So I gave\na lot of offense. Now, I'm generally tolerated as a harmless eccentric who\nwill soon be gone. But coming up, I had a difficult period to go through. My\nadvice to you is to be better than I was at keeping insights hidden. one of\nmy colleagues, who graduated as number one in his class in law school and"

But it wasn't\nwhat I did. I usually moved with the drift of my nature, and if some other\npeople didn't like it, well, I didn't need to be adored by everybody. \n \nCicero, the Greatest Lawyer of Antiquity \nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106 - 43 BC) lived through the decline and fall of\nthe Roman Republic and was important in many of the significant political\nevents of his time. Besides being an orator politician, and philosopher,\nCicero was primarily a lawyer with a great respect for the lessons of\nhistory. \nHe said: \"History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it\nillumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life, and\nbrings us tidings of antiquity.\n\f\n\"To be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a\nchild' For what is man's lifetime unless the memory of past events is woven\nwith those of earlier times?\" \n \nLet me further develop the idea that a multi-disciplinary attitude is required\nif maturity is to be effective. Here I'm following a key idea of the greatest\nlawyer of antiquity, Marcus Tullius Cicero [for more ideas from Cicero,\nplease see Munger's Reflections on Aging in Chapter One-Ed.] Cicero is\nfamous for saying that a man who doesn't know what happened before he's\nborn goes through life like a child. That is a very correct idea. Cicero is\nright to ridicule somebody so foolish as not to know history. But if you\ngeneralize Cicero, as I think one should, there are a lot of other things that\none shoUld know in addition to history'. And those other things are the big\nideas in all the disciplines. And it doesn't help you much just to know\nsomething well enough so that on one occasion you can prattle your way to\nan A in an exam. You have to learn many things in such a way that they're\nin a mental latticework in your head and yoUr automatically use them the\nrest of your life. If many of you try that, I solemnly promise that one day\nmost will correctly come to think, \"Somehow i have become one of the\nmost effective people in my whole age cohort.\" And, in contrast, if no effort\nis made toward such multidisciplinarity, \nmany of the brightest of you who choose this course will live in the middle\nranks. or in the shallows. \n \nThe way complex adaptive systems work, and the way mental constructs\nwork, problems frequently become easier to solve through \"inversion.\" If\n\f\nyou turn problems around into reverse, you often think better \n \nAnother idea that I discovered was encapsulated by that story Dean\nMcCaffrey recounted earlier about the rustic who \"wanted to know where\nhe was going to die, so he wouldn't go there.\" The rustic who had that\nridiculous sounding idea had a profound truth in his possession. -The way\ncomplex adaptive systems work, and the way mental constructs work,\nproblems frequently become easier to solve through \"inversion.\" If you turn\nproblems around into reverse, you often think better. For instance, if you\nwant to help India, the question you should consider asking is not: \"How\ncan I help India\" Instead. you should ask: \"How can I hurt India?\" You find\nwhat will do the worst damage, and then try to avoid it. Perhaps the two\napproaches seem logically the same thing. But those who have mastered\nalgebra know that inversion will often and easily solve problems that\notherwise resist solution. And in life, just as in algebra, inversion will help\nyou solve problems that you can't otherwise handle. \n \nLet me use a little inversion now. What will really fail in life? What do we\nwant to avoid? Some answers are easy. For example, sloth and unreliability\nwill fail. If you're unreliable it doesn't matter what your virtues are, you're\ngoing to crater immediately. So, faithfully doing what you've engaged to do\nshould be an automatic part of your conduct. OF course you want to avoid\nsloth and unreliability. \n \n,,,you want to be very careful with intense ideology. It presents a big danger\nfor the only mind you're ever going to get.\n\f\nAnother thing to avoid is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up\none's mind. You see a lot of it in the worst of the TV preachers. They have\ndifferent, intense, inconsistent ideas about technical theology, and a lot of\nthem have minds reduced to cabbage. (Audience laughs) And that can\nhappen with political ideology. And if you're young, it's particularly easy to\ndrift into intense and foolish political ideology and never get out. When you\nannounce that you're a loyal member of some cult-like group and you start\nshouting out the orthodox ideology, what you're doing is pounding it in,\npounding it in, pounding it in. You're ruining your mind, sometimes with\nstartling speed. So you want to be very careful with intense ideology. It\npresents a big danger for the only mind you're ever going to have. \n \nThe iron Prescription a la Darwin \nDarwin formulated his theories on the transmutation of species in the late\n1830's, but it was not until 1859 that he published his seminal work, On the\nOrigin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Darwin accepted that any\nscientific theory proffering an alternative explanation to human origins\nwould be met with widespread prejudice and that therefore prudence\ndictated he become fully versed in every possible counter argument before\npublishing his ideas. Accordingly, he spent twenty years painstakingly\ncultivating his theory and preparing for its defense. \n \nThere is a warning example I use whenever I feel threatened by drift toward\nintense political ideology. Some Scandinavian canoeists succeeded in\ngetting through all the rapids of Scandinavia, and they thought they would"

    "raw_text": "continue their success by tackling the big whirlpools in northwest America.\nThe death rate was one hundred percent. A big whirlpool is something you\nwant to avoid. And I think the same is true about intense ideology,\nparticularly when your companions are all true believers. \n \nI have what I call an \"iron prescription\" that helps me keep sane when I\ndrift toward preferring one intense ideology over another. I feel that I'm not\nentitled to have an opinion unless I can state the arguments against my\nposition better than the people who are in opposition. I think that I am\nqualified to speak only when I've reached that state. This sounds almost as\nextreme as the \"iron prescription\" Dean Acheson was fond of attributing to\nWilliam the Silent of Orange, who roughly said, \"It's not necessary to hope\nin order to persevere.\" That probably is too tough for most people, although\nI hope it won't ever become too tough for me. My way of avoiding over-\nintensity in ideology is easier than Acheson's injunction and worth learning.\nThis business of not drifting into extreme ideology is very very important in\nlife. If you want to end up wise, heavy ideology is very likely to prevent\nthat outcome. \n \nI feel that I'm not entitled to have an opinion unless I can state the\narguments against my position better than the people who are in\nopposition. \n \nAnother thing that often causes folly and ruin is the \"self-serving bias,\"\noften subconscious, to which we're all subject. You think that \"the true little\nme\" is entitled to do what it wants to do. For instance, why shouldn't the\n\f\ntrue little me get what it wants by overspending its income? Well, there\nonce was a man who became the most famous composer in the world. But\nhe was utterly miserable most of the time. And one of the reasons was that\nhe always overspent his income. That was Mozart. If Mozart couldn't get by\nwith this kind of asinine conduct, I don't think you should try it. (Audience\nlaughs.) \n \nIf Mozart couldn't get by with this kind of asinine conduct, I don't think you\nshould try it. \n \nGenerally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self-pity are disastrous\nmodes of thought. Self-pity can get pretty close to paranoia. And paranoia\nis one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into\nself-pity. I had a friend who carried a thick stack of linen-based cards. And\nwhen somebody would make a comment that reflected self-pity, he would\nslowly and portentously pull out his huge stack of cards, take the top one\nand hand it to the person. The card said, \"Your story has touched my heart.\nNever have I heard of anyone with as many misfortunes as you.\" Well, you\ncan say that's waggery but I suggest it can be mental hygiene. Every time\nyou find you're drifting into self-pity, whatever the cause, even if your child\nis dying of cancer, self-pity is not going to help. Just give yourself one of\nmy friend's cards. Self-pity is always counterproductive. It's the wrong way\nto think. And when you avoid it, you get a great advantage over everybody\nelse, or almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard response.\nAnd you can train yourself out of it.\n\f\nMozart-Spendthrift? \nThe notion of Mozart as impoverished composer comes primarily from a\nseries of letters he wrote from 1788 to l79l to his Masonic brother, Michael\nPuchberg, asking for loans. Other evidence suggests Mozart's income,\nthough subject to considerable fluctuation, was unusually high for a\nmusician, placing him during some years in the top l0 percent of all Vienna\ninhabitants. Economists William and Hilda Baumol, on the other hand,\ncalculate that Mozart's income in the last decade of his life was middle class\nat 3,000-4,000 forints a year (about $30,000-$40,000 in 1990). \n'What happened to Mozartt money? Mozartt sickly wife, Constantly,\nrequired regular cures at spring baths used only by the wealthy. During lean\ntimes, the Mozarts continued to live in their accustomed style, giving\nthemselves cash flow problems. The situation was exacerbated by their\nfailure to save any money during rush periods and by a judgment against\nMozart in l79l resulting from a suit brought by Prince Karl Lichnowsky.\nSome scholars also cite evidence that Mozart gambled at billiards and\ncards. \n \nOf course you also want to get self-serving bias out of your mental routines.\nThinking that what's good for you is good for the wider civilization, and\nrationalizing foolish or evil conduct, based on your subconscious tendency\nto serve yourself, is a terrible way to think. And your want to drive that out\nof yourself because you want to be wise not foolish, and good not evil. You\nalso have to allow, in your own cognition and conduct, for the self-serving\nbias of everybody else, because most people are not going to be very\nsuccessful at removing such bias, the human condition being what it is. If\n\f\nyou don't allow for self-serving bias in the conduct of others, you are, again,\na fool. \n \nIf you don't allow for self-serving bias in the conduct of others, you are,\nagain, a fool. \n \nI watched the brilliant and worthy Harvard Law Review trained general\ncounsel of Salomon Brothers lose his career there. When the able CEO was\ntold that an underling had done something wrong, the general counsel said,\n\"Gee, we don't have any legal duty to report this, but I think it's what we\nshould do. It's our moral duty.\" The general counsel was technically and\nmorally correct. But his approach didn't persuade. He recommended a very\nunpleasant thing for the busy CEO to do and the CEO, quite\nunderstandably, put the issue off, and put it off, and not with any intent to\ndo wrong. In due course, when powerful regulators resented not having\nbeen promptly informed, down went the CEO and the general counsel with\nhim. \n \nThe correct persuasive technique in situations like that was given by Ben\nFranklin. He said, \"if you would persuade, appeal to interest, not to reason.\"\nThe self-serving bias of man is extreme and should have been used in\nattaining the correct outcome. So the general counsel should have said,\n\"Look, this is likely to erupt into something that will destroy you, take away\nyour money, take away your status, grossly impair your reputation. My\nrecommendation will prevent a likely disaster from which you can't\n\f\nrecover.\" That approach would have worked. You should often appeal to\ninterest, not to reason, even when your motives are lofty. \n \nAnother thing to avoid is being subjected to perverse incentives. You don't\nwant to be in a perverse incentive system that's regarding you if you behave\nmore and more foolishly, or worse and worse. Perverse incentives are so\npowerful as controllers of human cognition and human behavior that one\nshould avoid their influence. \nAnd one of the things you're going to find in at least a few modern law\nfirms is high billable-hour quotas. I could not have lived under billable-hour\nquotas of 2400 hours a year. That would have caused too many problems\nfor me. I wouldn't have done it. I don't have a solution for the situation\nsome of you will face. You'll have to figure out for yourselves how to\nhandle such significant problems. \n \nYou particularly want to avoid working directly under somebody you don't\nadmire and don't want to be like. \n \nPerverse associations are also to be avoided. You particularly want to avoid\nworking directly under somebody you don't admire and don't want to be\nlike. It's dangerous. We're all subject to control to some extent by authority\nfigures, particularly authority figures who are rewarding us. Dealing\nproperly with this danger requires both some talent and will. I coped in my\ntime by identifying people I admired and by maneuvering, mostly without\ncriticizing anybody, so that I was usually working under the right sort of\npeople. A lot of law firms will permit that if you're shrewd enough to work\n\f\nit out with some tact. Generally, your outcome in life will be more\nsatisfactory if you work under people you correctly admire. \n \nEngaging in routines that allow you to maintain objectivity are, of course,\nvery helpful to cognition. We all remember that Darwin paid special\nattention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed\nsomething he believed and loved. Routines like that are required if a life is\nto maximize correct thinking. And one also needs checklist routines. They\nprevent a lot of errors, and not just for pilots. You should not only possess\nwide-ranging elementary wisdom but also go through mental checklist\nroutines in using it. There is no other procedure that will work as well. \n \nI think the game of competitive life often requires maximizing the\nexperience of the people who have the most aptitude and the most\ndetermination as learning machines. \n \nNon Egalitarianism a la John Wooden \nAndy Hill was a stand out guard at University High School in Los Angeles\nin 1968. He averaged 27 points per game as a senior and was widely\nrecruited by some of the best basketball programs in the country. He chose\nUCLA and had a phenomenal year playing on the freshman squad. His 19\npoints and 8 assists per game earned him that tea,mt MVP award, which he\nshared with Henry Bibby. \nAndy's Cinderella story at UCLA, however, ended shortly thereafter. The\nvarsity squad had just won its sixth national championship in seven years,\nand Hill soon discovered the caliber of play on Coach Wooden's first-team"

    "raw_text": "was beyond his reach. Together with the other reserves who spent their\nvarsity careers on the bench. Hill became well versed in the non egalitarian\nnature of the sport as practiced by Wooden. In his enjoyable book, Be\nQuick-But Don't Hurry!, Hill recounts both the pain of this period of his\nlife, his eventual reconciliation with Wooden. and the valuable life-lessons\nhe gained from the experience. \n \nAnother idea that I found important is that maximizing non-egality will\noften work wonders. What do I mean? Well, John Wooden of UCLA\npresented an instructive example when he was the number one \nbasketball coach in the world. He said to the bottom 5 players, \"You don't\nget to play - you are practice partners.\" The top seven did almost all the\nplaying. Well, the top seven learned more-remember the importance of the\nlearning machine-because they were doing all the playing. And when he\nadopted that non-egalitarian system, Wooden won more games than he had\nwon before. I think the game of competitive life often requires maximizing\nthe experience of the people who have the most aptitude and the most\ndetermination as learning machines. And if you want the very highest\nreaches of human achievement, that's where you have to go. You do not\nwant to choose a brain surgeon for your child by drawing straws to select\none of fifty applicants, all of whom take turns doing procedures. You don't\nwant your airplanes designed in too egalitarian a fashion. You don't want\nyour Berkshire Hathaway's run that way either. You want to provide a lot of\nplaying time for your best players.\n\f\nYou don't want your airplanes designed in too egalitarian a fashion. You\ndon't want your Berkshire Hathaway's run that way either. You want to\nprovide a lot of playing time for your best players. \n \nI frequently tell the apocryphal story about how Max Planck, after he won\nthe Nobel Prize, went around Germany giving a same standard lecture on\nthe new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur memorized the\nlecture and said, \"Would you mind, Professor Planck, because it's so boring\nto stay in our routine, if I gave the lecture in Munich and you just sat in\nfront wearing my chauffeur's hat?\" Planck said, \"Why not?\" And the\nchauffeur got up and gave this long lecture on quantum mechanics. After\nwhich a physics professor stood up and asked a perfectly ghastly question.\nThe speaker said, \"Well, I'm surprised that in an advanced city like Munich\nI get such an elementary question. I'm going to ask my chauffeur to reply.\"\n(Audience laughs.) \n \nWell, the reason I tell that story is not to celebrate the quick wittedness of\nthe protagonist. In this world I think we have two kinds of knowledge: One\nis Planck knowledge, that of the people who really know. They've paid the\ndues, they have the aptitude. Then we've got chauffeur knowledge. They\nhave learned to prattle the talk. They may have a big head of hair. They\noften have fine timbre in their voices. They make a big impression. But in\nthe end what they've got is chauffeur knowledge masquerading as real\nknowledge. I think I've just described practically every politician in the\nUnited States. (Audience claps.) You're going to have the problem in your\nlife of getting as much responsibility as you can into the people with the\n\f\nPlanck knowledge and away from the people who have the chauffeur\nknowledge. And there are huge forces working against you. \n \nThey make a big impression. But in the end what they've got is chauffeur\nknowledge masquerading as real knowledge. \n \nMy generation has failed you to some extent. More and more, we're\ndelivering to you in California a legislature in which mostly the certified\nnuts from the left, and the certified nuts from the right, are the ones allowed\nto serve. And none of them are removable. That's what my generation has\ndone for you. But, you wouldn't like it to be too easy, would you? \n \nAnother thing that I have found is that intense interest in any subject is\nindispensable if you're really going to excel in it. I could force myself to be\nfairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn't excel in anything in which I\ndidn't have an intense interest. So to some extent you're going to have to do\nas I did. If at all feasible, you want to maneuver yourself into doing\nsomething in which you have an intense interest. \n \nAnother thing you have to do is have a lot of assiduity. I like that word\nbecause to me it means: \"Sit down on your ass until you do it.\" I've had\nmarvelous partners, full of assiduity, all my life. I think I got them partly\nbecause I tried to deserve them and partly because I was shrewd enough to\nselect them, and partly there was some luck. Two partners that I chose for\none phase in my life made the following simple agreement when they\ncreated a little design / build construction team in the middle of the great\n\f\ndepression: \"Two-man partnership,\" the said, \"and divide everything\nequally. And, whenever we're behind in our commitments to other people,\nwe will both work fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, until we're\ncaught up.\" Well, needless to say, that firm didn't fail. And my partners\nwere widely admired. Simple, old-fashioned ideas like theirs are almost\nsure to provide a good outcome. \n \nAnother thing to cope with is that life is very likely to provide terrible\nblows, unfair blows. Some people recover, and others don't. And there I\nthink the attitude of Epictetus helps guide one to the right reaction. He\nthoUght that every mischance in life, however bad, created an opportunity\nto behave well. He believed every mischance provided an opportunity to\nlearn something useful. And one's duty was not co become immersed in\nself-pity, but to utilize each terrible blow in a constructive fashion. His\nideas were very sound, influencing the best of the Roman emperors, Marcus\nAurelius, and many others over many centuries. And you may remember\nthe epitaph that Epictetus made for himself: \"Here lies Epictetus, a slave,\nmaimed in body the ultimate in poverty, and favored by the Gods.\" Well,\nthat's the way Epictetus is now remembered: \"Favored by the Gods.\" He\nwas favored because he became wise, became manly, and instructed others,\nboth in his own time and over following centuries. \n \nEpictetus: His Morals \nControl thy passions lest they take vengeance on thee. Do not seek to bring\nthings to pass in accordance with your wishes, but wish for them as they\nare, and you will find them. First learn the meaning of what you say, and"

If you want to improve, be\ncontent to be thought foolish and stupid. It is impossible to begin to learn\nthat which one thinks one already knows. its not what happens to you, but\nhow you react to it that matters. Make the best use of what is in your power,\nand take the rest as it happens. No man is free who is not master of himself.\nOnly the educated are free.

Wealth consists not in\nhaving great possessions, but in having few wants. \n \nI've another idea to emphasize in a brief account. My grandfather Munger\nwas the only federal judge in his city for nearly forty years. And I admired\nhim. I'm his namesake. And I'm Confucian enough that even now as I speak\nI'm thinking, \"Well, Judge Munger would be pleased to have me here.\" All\nthese years after my grandfather is dead, I conceive myself as duty bound to\ncarry the torch for my grandfather's values. One such value was prudence as\nthe servant of duty. Grandfather Munger was a federal judge at a time when\nthere were no pensions for widows of federal judges. So if he didn't save\nfrom his income, my grandmother would become a destitute widow. And,\nbesides, net worth would enable him to serve others better. Being the kind\nof man he was, he underspent his income all his life and left his widow in\ncomfortable circumstances. \n \nBut that was nor all that his prudence enabled. Along the way, in the '30's,\nmy uncle's tiny bank failed and couldn’t reopen without help. My\n\f\ngrandfather saved the bank by exchanging over a third of his good assets for\nhorrible bank assets. I've always remembered the event. It reminds me of\nHouseman's little poem that went something like this: \n \n\"The thoughts of others .Were light and feeding, Of lovers meeting Or luck\nor fame. Mine were of trouble, And mine were steady, And I was ready\nWhen trouble came.\" \n \nYou may well say \"Who wants to go through life anticipating troUble?\nWell, I did, trained as I was. I've gone through a long life anticipating\ntrouble. And here I arm now, well along in my 84th year. Like tricketts I've\nhad a favored life. It didn't make me unhappy to anticipate trouble all the\ntime and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came. It didn't hurt me at\nall. In fact it helped me. So, I quitclaim to you Houseman and Judge\nMunger. \n \nIn your own life what you want to maximize is a seamless web of deserved\ntrust. \n \nThe last idea that I want to give to you, as you go out into a profession that\nfrequently puts a lot of procedure and some mumbo jumbo into what it\ndoes, is that complex bureaucratic procedure does not represent the highest\nreach. One higher form is a seamless, non-bureaucratic web of deserved\ntrust. Not much fancy procedure, just totally reliable people correctly\ntrusting one another. 'that's the way an operating room works at the Mayo\nClinic. If lawyers would there introduce a lot of lawyer-like process, more\n\f\npatients would die. So never forget, when you're a lawyer, that while you\nmay have to sell procedure, you don't always have to buy. in your own life\nwhat you want to maximize is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your\nproposed marriage contract has 47 pages, my suggestion is that you not\nenter. (Audience laughs.) \n \nWell, that's enough for one graduation. I hope these ruminations of an old\nman are useful to you. In the end, I'm speaking toward the only outcome\nfeasible for old Valiant-for-Truth in Pilgrim\\ Progress: \"My sword I leave to\nhim who can wield it.\" (Audience applauds.) \n \nIn the run-up to publishing this book, Charlie remarked that one of the most\nimportant talks in our list, \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment,\" could\nuse \"a little revising\" to bring it in line with his most current views on the\nsubject. Little did we know, Charlie's \"little\" revision would amount to a\nfull-scale rewrite, with loads of new material, and a \"stop-the-press\"\ncompletion schedule. The talk features Charlie's original concept of\n\"behavioral finance,\" which has now burgeoned into its own academic field\nof study. As attendee Donald Hall recalls, \"Charlie was espousing his well-\nreasoned views on behavioral finance before the term was even coined.\" \n \nCharlie also addresses the importance of recognizing patterns to determine\nhow humans behave, both rationally and irrationally. He shares with us his\nchecklist of twenty-five standard causes of human misjudgment, which\ncontains observations that are ingenious, counterintuitive, and important-\nvalues Charlie treasures in the work of other great thinkers throughout\n\f\nhistory. He also emphasizes the \"lollapalooza\" power of psychological\nmisjudgments in combination. \n \nHere then, written exclusively for Poor Charlie’s Almanack, is Charlie's\nmagnum opus on why we behave the way we do.

    "raw_text": "eighty-one than he did more than ten years earlier when he (1) knew less\nand was more harried by a crowded life and (2) was speaking from rough\nnotes instead of revising transcripts. \n \nPREFACE \n \nWhen I read transcripts of my psychology talks given about fifteen years\nago, I realized that I could now create a more logical but much longer\n\"talk,\" including most of what I had earlier said. \n \nBut I immediately saw four big disadvantages. \n \nFirst, the longer \"talk,\" because it was written out with more logical\ncompleteness, would be more boring and confusing to many people than\nany earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncratic\ndefinitions of psychological tendencies in a manner reminiscent of both\npsychology textbooks and Euclid. And who reads textbooks for fun or\nrevisits Euclid? \n \nSecond, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from\nskimming three \npsychology textbooks about fifteen years ago, I know virtually nothing\nabout any academic psychology later developed. Yet, in a longer talk\ncontaining guesses, I would be criticizing much academic psychology. This\nsort of intrusion into a professional territory by an amateur would be sure to\nbe resented by professors who would rejoice in finding my errors and might\n\f\nbe prompted to respond to my published criticism by providing theirs. Why\nshould I care about new criticism Well, who likes new hostility from\narticulate critics with an information advantage \n \nThird, a longer version of my ideas would surely draw some disapproval\nfrom people formerly disposed to like me. Not only would there be stylistic\nand substantive objections, but also there would be perceptions of arrogance\nin an old man who displayed much disregard for conventional wisdom\nwhile \"popping-off' on a subject in which he had never taken a course. My\nold Harvard Law classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping-\noff \"the shoe button complex,\" named for the condition of a family friend\nwho spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant in the\nshoe button business. \n \nFourth, I might make a fool of myself. \n \nDespite these four very considerable objections, I decided to publish the\nmuch-expanded version. Thus, after many decades in which I have\nsucceeded mostly by restricting action to jobs and methods in which I was\nunlikely to fail, I have now chosen a course of action in which (1) I have no\nsignificant personal benefit to gain, (2) I will surely give some pain to\nfamily members and friends, and (3) I may make myself ridiculous. Why\nam I doing this? \n \nOne reason may be that my nature makes me \nincline toward diagnosing and talking about errors\n\f\nin conventional wisdom. And despite years of being \nsmoothed out by the hard knocks that were inevitable for one with my\nattitude, I don't believe life \never knocked all the boy's brashness out of the man. \n \nA second reason for my decision is my approval of the attitude of Diogenes\nwhen he asked: \"Of \nwhat use is a philosopher who never offends \nanybody?\" \n \nMY third and final reason is the strongest. I have fallen in love with my\nway of laying out psychology because it has been so useful for me. And so.\nbefore I die, I want to imitate to some \nextent the bequest practices of three characters: the protagonist in John\nBunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Benjamin Franklin, and my first employer,\nErnest Buffett. Bunyan's character, the knight wonderfully named \"Old\nValiant for Truth,\" makes the only \npractical bequest available to him when he says at the end of his life: \"My\nsword I leave to him who can wear it.\" And like this man, I don't mind if I\nhave misappraised my sword, provided I have tried to see it correctly, or\nthat many will not wish to try it, or that some who try to wield it may find it\nserves them not. Ben Franklin, to my great benefit, left \nbehind his autobiography, his Almanacs, and much \nelse. And Ernest Buffett did the best he could in the same mode when he\nleft behind \"How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I Have Learned\nabout Fishing.\" Whether or not this last contribution to the genre was the\n\f\nbest, I will not say. But I will report that I have now known four\ngenerations \nof Ernest Buffett's descendants and that the results \nhave encouraged my imitation of the founder. \n \nThe Psychology of Human Misjudgment \n \nI have long been very interested in standard \nthinking errors. \n \nHowever, I was educated in an era wherein the \ncontributions of non-patient-treating psychology to an understanding of\nmisjudgment met little \napproval from members of the mainstream elite. \nInstead, interest in psychology was pretty well \nconfined to a group of professors who talked and \npublished mostly for themselves, with much natural \ndetriment from isolation and groupthink. \n \nAnd so, right after my time at Caltech and \nHarvard Law School, I possessed a vast ignorance of psychology. Those\ninstitutions failed to require knowledge of the subject. And, of course, they \ncouldn't integrate psychology with their other \nsubject matter when they didn't know psychology. \nAlso, like the Nietzsche character who was proud"

    "raw_text": "of his lame leg, the institutions were proud of their willful avoidance of\n\"fuzzy\" psychology and \"fuzzy\" \npsychology professors. \n \nI shared this ignorant mindset for a considerable time. And so did a lot of\nother people. What \nare we to think, for instance, of the Caltech course catalogue that for years\nlisted just one psychology \nprofessor, self-described as a \"Professor of Psycho \nanalytical Studies,\" who taught both \"Abnormal \nPsychology\" and \"Psychoanalysis in Literature\"? \n \nSoon after leaving Harvard, I began a long struggle to get rid of the most\ndysfunctional part of my psychological ignorance. Today, I will describe \nmy long struggle for elementary wisdom and a brief summary of my ending\nnotions. After that, I will \ngive examples, many quite vivid and interesting \nto me, of both psychology at work and antidotes to psychology-based\ndysfunction. Then, I will end by \nasking and answering some general questions raised by what I have said.\nThis will be a long talk. \n \nWhen I started law practice, I had respect for the power of genetic evolution\nand appreciation \nof man's many evolution-based resemblances to \nless cognitively-gifted animals and insects. I was\n\f\naware that man was a \"social animal,\" greatly and \nautomatically influenced by behavior he observed in men around him. I also\nknew that man lived, like barnyard animals and monkeys, in limited \nsize dominance hierarchies, wherein he tended to \nrespect authority and to like and cooperare with his \nown hierarchy members while displaying consider \nable distrust and dislike for competing men nor in \nhis own hierarchy. \n \nBut this generalized, evolution-based theory \nstructure was inadequate to enable me to cope properly with the cognition I\nencountered. I \nwas soon surrounded by much extreme irrationality, displayed in patterns\nand subpatterns. So \nsurrounded, I could see that I was not going to cope as well as I wished with\nlife unless I could acquire \na better theory-structure on which to hang my observations and experiences.\nBy then, my craving for more theory had a long history. Partly, I had always\nloved theory as an aid in puzzle solving and \nas a means of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity. And, partly, I had found\nthat theory-structure was \na superpower in helping one get what you wanted, as I had early discovered\nin school wherein I had excelled without labor, guided by theory, while\nmany others, without mastery of theory, failed despite monstrous effort.\nBetter theory I thought, had always worked for me and, if now available,\n\f\ncould make me acquire capital and independence faster and better assist\neverything I loved. And so I slowly developed my own system of\npsychology, \nmore or less in the self-help style of Ben Franklin and with the\ndetermination displayed in the refrain of the nursery story: \"'Then ['ll do it\nmyself,' said the little red hen.\" \n \nI was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long\nlooked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great\nalgebraist, Jacobi: \"Invert, always invert.\" I sought good judgment mostly\nby collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such\noutcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad\njudgment that I paid \nno attention to boundaries between professional territories. After all, why\nshould I search for some \ntiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in \nmy own field when some large, important, easy-to find stupidity was just\nover the fence in the other fellow's professional territory? Besides, I could \n \nalready see that real-world problems didn't neatly lie within territorial\nboundaries. they jumped \nright across. And I was dubious of any approach \nthat, when two things were inextricably intertwined \nand interconnected, would try and think about one thing but not the other. I\nwas afraid, if I tried\n\f\nany such restricted approach, that I would end up, in the immortal words of\nJohn L. Lewis, \"with no brain at all, just a neck that had haired over.\" \n \nPure curiosity, somewhat later, made me wonder \nhow and why destructive cults were often able, \nover a single long weekend, to turn many tolerably \nnormal people into brainwashed zombies and thereafter keep them in that\nstate indefinitely. I resolved that I would eventually find a good answer to\nthis cult question if I could do so by general reading and \nmuch musing. \n \nI also got curious about social insects. It fascinated me that both the fertile\nfemale honeybee and \nthe fertile female harvester ant could multiply their \nquite different normal life expectancies by exactly \ntwenty by engaging in one gangbang in the sky. \nThe extreme success of the ants also fascinated me-how a few behavioral\nalgorithms caused such \nextreme evolutionary success grounded in extremes \nof cooperation within the breeding colony and, \nalmost always, extremes of lethal hostility toward \nants outside the breeding colony', even ants of the \nsame species. \n \nMotivated as I was, by midlife I should \nprobably have turned to psychology textbooks,\n\f\nbut I didn't, displaying my share of the outcome \npredicted by the German folk saying: \"We are too soon old and too late\nsmart.\" However, as I later found out, I may have been lucky to avoid for\nso \nlong the academic psychology that was then laid \nout in most textbooks. These would not then have \nguided me well with respect to cults and were often written as if the authors\nwere collecting psychology experiments as a boy collects butterflies-with a \npassion for more butterflies and more contact with fellow collectors and\nlittle craving for synthesis in what is already possessed. When I finally got\nto the psychology texts, I was reminded of the \nobservation of Jacob Viner, the great economist, that many an academic is\nlike the truffle hound, \nan animal so trained and bred for one narrow purpose that it is no good at\nanything else. I was \nalso appalled by hundreds of pages of extremely \nnonscientific musing about comparative weights \nof nature and nurture in human outcomes. And I \nfound that introductory psychology texts, by and \nlarge, didn't deal appropriately with a fundamental \nissue: Psychological tendencies tend to be both \nnumerous and inseparably intertwined, now and forever, as they interplay in\nlife. Yet the complex \nparsing out of effects from intertwined tendencies \nwas usually avoided by the writers of the elementary texts. Possibly the\nauthors did not wish, \nthrough complexity, to repel entry of new devotees\n\f\nto their discipline. And, possibly, the cause of their \ninadequacy was the one given by Samuel Johnson in response to a woman\nwho inquired as to what accounted for his dictionary's misdefinition of the\nword \"pastern.\" \"Pure ignorance,\" Johnson replied. And, finally, the text\nwriters showed little \ninterest in describing standard antidotes to standard \npsychology-driven folly, and they thus avoided most \ndiscussion of exactly what most interested me. \n \nBut academic psychology has some very important merits alongside its\ndefects. I learned \nthis eventually, in the course of general reading, \nfrom a book, Influence, aimed at a popular audience, \nby a distinguished psychology professor, Robert \nCialdini, at Arizona State, a very big university. \nCialdini had made himself into a super-tenured \"Regents Professor\" at very\nyoung age by \ndevising, describing, and explaining a vast group of \nclever experiments in which man manipulated man \nto his detriment, with all of this made possible by \nman's intrinsic thinking flaws. \n \nI immediately sent copies of Cialdini's book to all my children. I also gave\nCialdini a share of Berkshire stock [Class A] to thank him for what he had\ndone for me and the public. Incidentally, the\n\f\nsale by Cialdini of hundreds of thousands of copies of a book about social\npsychology was a huge feat, \nconsidering that Cialdini didn't claim that he was \ngoing to improve your sex life or make you any \nmoney. \n \nPart of Cialdini's large book-buying audience came because, like me, it\nwanted to learn how to \nbecome less often tricked by salesmen and circumstances. However, as an\noutcome not sought by \nCialdini, who is a profoundly ethical man, a huge \nnumber of his books were bought by salesmen \nwho wanted to learn how to become more effective \nin misleading customers. Please remember this \nperverse outcome when my discussion comes to \nincentive-caused bias as a consequence of the \nsuperpower of incentives. \n \nWith the push given by Cialdini's book, I soon \nskimmed through three much used textbooks \ncovering introductory psychology. I also pondered \nconsiderably while craving synthesis and taking \ninto account all my previous training and experience. The result was\nMunger's partial summary of \nthe non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. nurture \nweighing parts of non developmental psychology.\n\f\nThis material was stolen from its various discoverers \n(most of whose names I didn't even try to learn), \noften with new descriptions and titles selected to fit Munger's notion of\nwhat makes recall easy for \nMunger, then revised to make Munger's use easy as \nhe seeks to avoid errors. \n \nI will start my summary with a general observation that helps explain what\nfollows. This observation is grounded in what we know about social \ninsects. The limitations inherent in evolution's \ndevelopment of the nervous-system cells that \ncontrol behavior are beautifully demonstrated by \nthese insects, which often have a mere 100,000 or so \ncells in their entire nervous systems, compared to \nman's multiple billions of cells in his brain alone \n \nEach ant, like each human, is composed of a \nliving physical structure plus behavioral algorithms in its nerve cells. In the\nant's case, the behavioral \nalgorithms are few in number and almost entirely genetic in origin. The ant\nlearns a little behavior from experiences, but mostly it merely responds \nto ten or so stimuli with a few simple responses \nprogrammed into its nervous system by its genes. \n \nNaturally, the simple ant behavior system has extreme limitations because\nof its limited nerve\n\f\nsystem repertoire. For instance, one type of ant, when it smells a pheromone\ngiven off by a dead \nant's body in the hive, immediately responds by \ncooperating with other ants in carrying the dead body out of the hive. And\nHarvard's great E.O. \nWilson performed one of the best psychology \nexperiments ever done when he painted dead-ant pheromone on a live ant.\nQuite naturally, the other ants dragged this useful live ant out of the hive\neven though it kicked and otherwise protested throughout the entire process.\nSuch is the brain of the ant. It has a simple program of responses that\ngenerally work out all right, but which are imprudently used by rote in\nmany cases. \n \nAnother type of ant demonstrates that the \nlimited brain of ants can be misled by circumstances as well as by clever\nmanipulation from other creatures. The brain of this ant contains a \nsimple behavioral program that directs the ant, \nwhen walking, to follow the ant ahead. And when \nthese ants stumble into walking in a big circle, they sometimes walk round\nand round until they perish. \n \nIt seems obvious. to me at least. that the human brain must often operate\ncounterproductively just \nlike the ant's, from unavoidable oversimplicity in \nits mental process, albeit usually in trying to solve \nproblems more difficult than those faced by ants\n\f\nthat don't have to design airplanes. \n \nThe perception system of man clearly demonstrates just such an unfortunate\noutcome. Man is \neasily fooled, either by the cleverly thought out \nmanipulation of man, by circumstances occurring \nby accident, or by very effective manipulation \npractices that man has stumbled into during \n\"practice evolution\" and kept in place because they work so well. One such\noutcome is caused by a quantum effect in human perception. If stimulus is\nkept below a certain level, it does not get through. \n \nAnd, for this reason, a magician was able to make \nthe Statue of Liberty disappear after a certain amount of magician lingo\nexpressed in the dark. The audience was not aware that it was sitting on a\nplatform that was rotating so slowly, below man's sensory threshold, that no\none could feel the acceleration implicit in the considerable rotation. When a\nsurrounding curtain was then opened in the place on the platform where the\nStatue had earlier appeared, it seemed to have disappeared. And even when\nperception does get through to man's brain, it is often mis weighted,\nbecause what is registered in perception is in shockingness of apparent\ncontrast, not the standard scientific units that make possible science and\ngood engineering. \n \nA magician demonstrates this sort of contrast based error in your nervous\nsystem when he removes your wristwatch without your feeling it. As he\n\f\ndoes this, he applies pressure of touch on your wrist that you would sense if\nit was the only pressure of touch you were experiencing. But he has\nconcurrently applied other intense pressure of touch on your body, but not\non your wrist, \"swamping\" the wrist pressure by creating a high-contrast\ntouch pressure elsewhere. This high contrast takes the wrist pressure below\nperception. \n \nSome psychology professors like to demonstrate the inadequacy of contrast-\nbased perception by having students put one hand in a bucket of hot water\nand one hand in a bucket of cold water. They are then suddenly asked to\nremove both hands and place them in a single bucket of room temperature\nwater. Now, with both hands in the same water, one hand feels as if it has\njust been put in cold water and the other hand feels as if it has just been\nplaced in hot water. When one thus sees perception so easily fooled by mere\ncontrast, where a simple temperature gauge would make no error, and\nrealizes that cognition mimics perception in being misled by mere contrast,\nhe is well on the way toward understanding, not only how magicians fool\none, but also how life will fool one. This can occur, through deliberate\nhuman manipulation or otherwise, if one doesn't take certain precautions\nagainst often-wrong effects from generally useful tendencies in his\nperception and cognition. \n \nMan’s often wrong but generally useful psychological tendencies are quite\nnumerous and quite different. The natural consequence of this profusion of\ntendencies is the grand general principle of social psychology: cognition is\nordinarily situation-dependent so that different situations often cause"

    "raw_text": "behold, that solution worked. \n \nEarly in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the government,\nhad a similar experience. He had to go back to Xerox because he \ncouldn't understand why its new machine was \nselling so poorly in relation to its older and inferior \nmachine. When he got back to Xerox, he found out \nthat the commission arrangement with the salesmen \ngave a large and perverse incentive to push the \ninferior machine on customers. who deserved a \nbetter result. \n \nAnd then there is the case of Mark Twain's cat \nthat, after a bad experience with a hot stove, never \nagain sat on a hot stove, or a cold stove either. \n \nWe should also heed the general lesson implicit \nin the injunction of Ben Franklin in Poor Richard's Almanack'. \"If you\nwould persuade, appeal to \ninterest and not to reason.\" This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple\nprecaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you \nshould be thinking about the power of incentives. \nI once saw a very smart house counsel for a major investment bank lose his\njob, with no moral fault, \nbecause he ignored the lesson in this maxim of Franklin. This counsel failed\nto persuade his client\n\f\nbecause he told him his moral duty, as correctly \nconceived by the counsel, without also telling the client in vivid terms that\nhe was very likely to be clobbered to smithereens if he didn't behave as his \ncounsel recommended. As a result, both client and \ncounsel lost their careers. \n \nWe should also remember how a foolish and willful ignorance of the\nsuperpower of rewards \ncaused Soviet communists to get their final result as described by one\nemployee: \"They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.\" Perhaps the\nmost \nimportant rule in management is \"Get the incentives right.\" \n \nBut there is some limit to a desirable emphasis \non incentive superpower. One case of excess \nemphasis happened at Harvard, where B. F, \nSkinner, a psychology professor, finally made \nhimself ridiculous. At one time, Skinner may \nhave been the best-known psychology professor \nin the world. He partly deserved his peak reputation because his early\nexperiments using rats and \npigeons were ingenious, and his results were both \ncounterintuitive and important. With incentives, \nhe could cause more behavior change, culminating \nin conditioned reflexes in his rats and pigeons, \nthan he could in any other way. He made obvious\n\f\nthe extreme stUpidity, in dealing with children \nor employees, of rewarding behavior one didn't want more of. Using food\nrewards, he even caused \nstrong superstitions, pre designed by himself, in \nhis pigeons. He demonstrated again and again a \ngreat recurring, generalized behavioral algorithm \nin nature: \"Repeat behavior that works.\" He also \ndemonstrated that prompt rewards worked much \nbetter than delayed rewards in changing and main \ntraining behavior. And, once his rats and pigeons \nhad conditioned reflexes, caused by food rewards, \nhe found what withdrawal pattern of rewards kept \nthe reflexive behavior longest in place: random \ndistribution. With this result, Skinner thought \nhe had pretty well explained man's misgambling \ncompulsion whereunder he often foolishly proceeds to ruin. But, as we shall\nlater see when we discuss \nother psychological tendencies that contribute to \nmiss gambling compulsion, he was only partly right. \nLater, Skinner lost most of his personal reputation \n(a) by overclaiming free incentive superpower to the \npoint of thinking he could create a human utopia \nwith it and (b) by displaying hardly any recognition \nof the power of the rest of psychology. He thus behaved like one of Jacob\nViner's truffle hounds as he tried to explain everything with incentive \neffects. Nonetheless, Skinner was right in his main\n\f\nidea: Incentives are superpowers. The outcome of his basic experiments\nwill always remain in high \nrepute in the annals of experimental science. And \nhis method of monomaniacal reliance on rewards, \nfor many decades after his death, did more good \nthan anything else in improving autistic children. \n \nWhen I was at Harvard Law School, the professors sometimes talked about\nan overfocused, \nSkinner-like professor at Yale Law School. they \nused to say: \"Poor old Eddie Blanchard, he thinks declaratory judgments\nwill cure cancer.\" Well, that's the way Skinner got with his very extreme\nemphasis on incentive superpower. I always call \nthe \"Johnny-one-note\" turn of mind chat eventually \nso diminished Skinner's reputation the man-with-a \nhammer tendency, after the folk saying: \"To a man \nwith only a hammer every problem looks pretty much like a nail.\" Man-\nwith-a-hammer tendency \ndoes not exempt smart people like Blanchard and \nSkinner. And it won't exempt you if you don't watch out. I will return to\nman-with-a-hammer \ntendency at various times in this talk because, \nfortunately, there are effective antidotes that reduce \nthe ravages of what pretty much ruined the personal \nreputation of the brilliant Skinner.\n\f\nOne of the most important consequences of \nincentive superpower is what I call \"incentive \ncaused bias.\" A man has an acculturated nature \nmaking him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven \nboth consciously and subconsciously by incentives, \nhe drifts into immoral behavior in order to get what \nhe wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing \nhis bad behavior, like the salesmen at Xerox who \nharmed customers in order to maximize their sales \ncommissions. \n \nHere, my early education involved a surgeon \nwho over the years sent bushel baskets full of \nnormal gall bladders down to the pathology lab \nin the leading hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska, my \ngrandfather's town. And, with that permissive \nquality control for which community hospitals are \nfamous, many years after this surgeon should've \nbeen removed from the medical staff, he was. One \nof the doctors who participated in the removal was a family friend, and I\nasked him: \"Did this \nsurgeon think, 'Here's a way for me to exercise my talents'-this guy was\nvery skilled technically-'and \nmake a high living by doing a few maimings and \nmurders every year in the course of routine fraud?\"' And my friend\nanswered: \"Hell no, Charlie. He\n\f\nthought that the gallbladder was the source of all \nmedical evil, and, if you really loved your patients, \nyou couldn't get that organ out rapidly enough.\" \n \nNow that's an extreme case, but in lesser \nstrength, the cognitive drift of that surgeon is \npresent in every profession and in every human \nbeing. And it causes perfectly terrible behavior. \nConsider the presentations of brokers selling \ncommercial real estate and businesses. I've never \nseen one that I thought was even within hailing distance of objective truth.\nIn my long life, I have \nnever seen a management consultant's report that didn't end with the same\nadvice: \"This problem \nneeds more management consulting services.\" \nWidespread incentive-caused bias requires that one \nshould often distrust, or take with a grain of salt, the advice of one's\nprofessional advisor, even if he is an \nengineer. The general antidotes here are: (1) especially fear professional\nadvice when it is especially good for the advisor; (2)learn and use the basic \nelements of your advisor's trade as you deal with \nyour advisor; and (3) double check, disbelieve, or \nreplace much of what you're told, to the degree that \nseems appropriate after objective thought. \n \nThe power of incentives to cause rationalized,\n\f\nterrible behavior is also demonstrated by Defense \nDepartment procurement history. After the Defense Department had much\ntruly awful experience with misbehaving contractors motivated under \ncontracts paying on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of \ncost basis, the reaction of our republic was to make it a crime for a\ncontracting officer in the Defense \nDepartment to sign such a contract, and not only a \ncrime, but a felony. \n \nAnd, by the way, although the government was \nright to create this new felony, much of the way the rest of the world is run,\nincluding the operation of many law firms and a lot of other firms, is still\nunder \nwhat is, in essence, a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost \nreward system. And human nature, bedeviled by \nincentive-caused bias, causes a lot of ghastly abuse \nunder these standard incentive patterns of the \nworld. And many of the people who are behaving terribly you would be\nglad to have married into your family, compared to what you're otherwise\nlikely to \nget. \n \nNow there are huge implications from the fact \nthat the human mind is put together this way. One implication is that people\nwho create things like\n\f\ncash registers, which make dishonest behavior hard to accomplish, are some\nof the effective saints of our civilization because, as Skinner so well knew,\nbad behavior is intensely habit-forming when it \nis rewarded. And so the cash register was a great \nmoral instrument when it was created. And, by the way, Patterson, the great\nevangelist of the cash \nregister, knew that from his own experience. He had a little store, and his\nemployees were stealing \nhim blind, so that he never made any money. \nThen people sold him a couple of cash registers, \nand his store went to profit immediately. He \npromptly closed the store and went into the cash \nregister business, creating what became the mighty National Cash Register\nCompany, one of the glories of its time. \"Repeat behavior that works\" \nis a behavioral guide that really succeeded for Patterson, after he applied\none added twist. And so \ndid high moral cognition. An eccentric, invetebrate \ndo-gooder (except when destroying competitors, all \nof which he regarded as would-be patent thieves), \nPatterson, like Carnegie, pretty well gave away all \nhis money to charity before he died, always pointing out that \"shrouds have\nno pockets.\" So great was \nthe contribution of Patterson's cash register to \ncivilization, and so effectively did he improve the \ncash register and spread its use, that in the end, \nhe probably deserved the epitaph chosen for the Roman poet Horace: \"I did\nnot completely die.\"\n\f\n'The strong tendency of employees to rationalize bad conduct in order to get\nrewards \nrequires many antidotes in addition to the good \ncash control promoted by Patterson. Perhaps the \nmost important of these antidotes is use of sound \naccounting theory and practice. This was seldom \nbetter demonstrated than at Westinghouse, which \nhad a subsidiary that made loans having no connection to the rest of\nWestinghouse's businesses. The \nofficers of Westinghouse, perhaps influenced by \nenvy of General Electric, wanted to expand profits \nfrom loans to outsiders. Under Westinghouse's \naccounting practice, provisions for future credit \nlosses on these loans depended largely on the past credit experience of its\nlending subsidiary, which \nmainly made loans unlikely to cause massive losses. \n \nNow there are two special classes of loans that \nnaturally cause much trouble for lenders. The first \nis ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans \nto any kind of real estate developer, and the second \nis any kind of construction loan on a hotel. So, naturally, if one was willing\nto loan approximately \nninety-five percent of the real cost to a developer \nconstructing a hotel, the loan would bear a much\n\f\nhigher-than-normal interest rate because the credit \nloss danger would be much higher than normal. So, \nsound accounting for Westinghouse in making a big, \nnew mass of ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans to hotel\ndevelopers would have been to \nreport almost no profit, or even a loss, on each loan \nuntil, years later, the loan became clearly worth par. \nBut Westinghouse instead plunged into big-time \nconstruction lending on hotels, using accounting \nthat made its lending officers look good because it \nshowed extremely high starting income from loans \nthat were very inferior to the loans from which the \ncompany had suffered small credit losses in the past. This terrible\naccounting was allowed by both \ninternational and outside accountants for Westing \nhouse as they displayed the conduct predicted by the refrain: \"Whose bread\nI eat, his song I sing.\" \nThe result was billions of dollars of losses. \nWho was at fault? The guy from the refrigerator \ndivision, or some similar division, who as lending \nofficer was suddenly in charge of loans to hotel \ndevelopers? Or the accountants and other senior \npeople who tolerated a nearly insane incentive \nstructure, almost sure to trigger incentive-caused \nbias in a lending officer? My answer puts most \nblame on the accountants and other senior people \nwho created the accounting system. These people\n\f\nbecame the equivalent of an armored car cash \ncarrying service that suddenly decided to dispense with vehicles and have\nunarmed midgets hand-carry \nits customers' cash through slums in open bushel \nbaskets. \n \nI wish I could tell you that this sort of thing no \nlonger happens, but this is not so. After Westing \nhouse blew up, General Electric's Kidder Peabody subsidiary put a silly\ncomputer program in place \nthat allowed a bond trader to show immense fictional profits. And after that,\nmuch accounting \nbecame even worse, perhaps reaching its nadir at \nEnron. \n \nAnd so incentive-caused bias is a huge, \nimportant thing, with highly important antidotes, like the cash register and a\nsound accounting system. But when I came years ago to the psychology\ntexts, I found that, while they were about one thousand pages long, there\nwas little therein that dealt with incentive-caused bias and no \nmention of Patterson or sound accounting systems. \nSomehow incentive-caused bias and its antidotes \npretty well escaped the standard survey courses in \npsychology, even though incentive-caused bias had \nlong been displayed prominently in much of the world's great literature, and\nantidotes to it had long existed in standard business routines. In the end. I"

    "raw_text": "concluded that when something was obvious in life but not easily\ndemonstrable in certain kinds of easy to-do, repeatable academic\nexperiments, the truffle \nhounds of psychology very often missed it. \n \nIn some cases, other disciplines showed more \ninterest in psychological tendencies than did \npsychology at least as explicated in psychology textbooks. For instance,\neconomists, speaking film \nthe employer's point of view, have long had a name \nfor the natural results of incentive-caused bias: \n\"agency cost.\" As the name implies, the economists have typically known\nthat, just as grain is always \nlost to rats, employers always lose to employees who improperly think of\nthemselves first. Employer \ninstalled antidotes include touch internal audit systems and severe public\npunishment for identified miscreants, as well as misbehavior-preventing \nroutines and such machines as cash registers. From the employee's point of\nview incentive-caused \nbias quite naturally causes opposing abuse from \nthe employer: the sweatshop, the unsafe work \nplace, etc. And these bad results for employees \nhave antidotes not only in pressure liom unions but \nalso in government action, such as wage and hour \nlaws, workplace-safety rules, measures fostering \nunionization, and workers' compensation systems.\n\f\nGiven the opposing psychology-induced strains that naturally occur in\nemployment because of \nincentive-caused bias on both sides of the relationship, it is no wonder the\nChinese are so much into \nYin and Yang. \n \nThe inevitable ubiquity of incentive-caused \nbias has vast, generalized consequences. For \ninstance, a sales force living only on commissions will be much harder to\nkeep moral than one under \nless pressure from the compensation arrangement. \nOn the other hand, a purely commissioned sales \nforce marvell be more efficient per dollar spent. \nTherefore, difficult decisions involving trade-offs \nare common in creating compensation arrangements \nin the sales function. \n \nThe extreme success of free-market capitalism \nas an economic system owes much to its prevention of many of bad effects\nfrom incentive-caused \nbias. Most capitalist owners in a vast web of free market economic activity\nare selected for ability by surviving in a brutal competition with other\nowners \nand have a strong incentive to prevent all waste in operations within their\nownership. After all, they\n\f\nlive on the difference between their competitive prices and their overall\ncosts and their businesses will perish if costs exceed sales. Replace such\nowners by salaried employees of the state and you will normally get a\nsubstantial reduction in overall efficiency as each employee who replaces\nan owner \nis subject to incentive-caused bias as he determines what service he will\ngive in exchange for his salary and how much he will yield to peer pressure\nfrom many fellow employees who do not desire his \ncreation of any strong performance model. \n \nAnother generalized consequence of incentive \ncaused bias is that man tends to \"game\" all human systems, often displaying\ngreat ingenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. Anti \ngaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and \nnecessary part of almost all system design. Also needed in system design is\nan admonition: Dread, \nand avoid as much you can, rewarding people for \nwhat can be easily faked. Yet our legislators and judges, usually including\nmany lawyers educated in \neminent universities, often ignore this injunction. \nAnd society consequently pays a huge price in the \ndeterioration of behavior and efficiency, as well as \nthe incurrence of unfair costs and wealth transfers. If education were\nimproved, with psychological \nreality becoming better taught and assimilated, \nbetter system design might well come out of our\n\f\nlegislatures and courts. \n \nOf course, money is now the main reward that drives habits. A monkey can\nbe trained to seek and work for an intrinsically worthless token, as if it were\na banana, if the token is routinely exchange \nable for a banana. So it is also with humans working for money-only more\nso, because human money \nis exchangeable for many desired things in addition \nto food, and one ordinarily gains status from either holding or spending it.\nMoreover, a rich person will often, through habit, work or connive\nenergetically for more money long after he has almost \nno real need for more. Averaged out, money is a \nmainspring of modern civilization, having little precedent in the behavior of\nnonhuman animals. \nMoney rewards are also intertwined with other forms of reward. For\ninstance. some people use \nmoney to buy status and others use status to get \nmoney, while still others sort of do both things at \nthe same time. \n \nAlthough money is the main driver among rewards, it is not the only reward\nthat works. \nPeople also change their behavior and cognition for \nsex, friendship, companionship, advancement in \nstatus. and other non monetary items.\n\f\n\"Granny's Rule\" provides another example of reward superpower, so\nextreme in its effects that it must be mentioned here. You can successfully \nmanipulate your own behavior with this rule, even if you are using as\nrewards items that you already \npossess! Indeed, consultant PhD. psychologists often urge business\norganizations to improve their \nreward systems by teaching executives to use \"Granny's Rule\" to govern\ntheir own daily behavior. \nGranny's Rule, to be specific, is the requirement \nthat children eat their carrots before they get \ndessert. And the business version requires that \nexecutives force themselves daily to first do their \nunpleasant and necessary tasks before rewarding themselves by proceeding\nto their pleasant tasks. \nGiven reward superpower, this practice is wise and sound. Moreover. the\nrule can also be used in the nonbusiness part of life. The emphasis on daily\nuse of this practice is not accidental. The consultants well know after the\nteaching of Skinner, that \nprompt rewards work best. \n \nPunishments, of course, also strongly influence behavior and cognition,\nalthough not so flexibly and wonderfully as rewards. For instance, illegal\nprice fixing was fairly common in America when it was customarily\npunished by modest fines. Then, after \na few prominent business executives were removed \nfrom their eminent positions and sent to federal\n\f\nprisons, price-fixing behavior was greatly reduced. \n \nMilitary and naval organizations have very often been extreme in using\npunishment to change \nbehavior, probably because they needed to cause \nextreme behavior. Around the time of Caesar, there \nwas a European tribe that, when the assembly horn \nblew, always killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place, and no one\nenjoyed fighting this tribe. And George Washington hanged farm-boy\ndeserters forty feet high as an example to others \nwho might contemplate desertion. \n \nTwo: Liking/Loving Tendency \n \nA newly hatched baby goose is programmed, \nthrough the economy of its genetic program, to \n\"love\" and follow the first creature that is nice to it, which is almost always\nits mother. But, if the mother goose is not present right after the hatching,\nand a man is there instead, the gosling will \"love\" \nand follow the man. who becomes a sort of substitute mother. \n \nSomewhat similarly, a newly arrived human \nis \"born to like and love\" under the normal and abnormal triggering\noutcomes for its kind. Perhaps the strongest inborn tendency is love ready\nto be triggered-is that of the human mother for its child. On the other hand,\nthe similar \"child-loving\"\n\f\nbehavior of a mouse can be eliminated by the deletion of a single gene,\nwhich suggests there is some sort of triggering gene in a mother mouse as \nwell as in a gosling. \n \nEach child, like a gosling, will almost surely \ncome to like and love, not only as driven by its sexual nature, but also in\nsocial groups not limited to its genetic or adoptive \"family.\" Current\nextremes of romantic love almost surely did not \noccur in man's remote past. Our early human ancestors were surely more\nlike apes triggered into \nmating in a pretty mundane fashion. \n \nAnd what will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his parent,\nspouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and loved. And so\nmany a courtship competition will be won by a \nperson displaying exceptional devotion, and man will generally strive,\nlifelong, for the affection and approval of many people not related to him. \n \nOne very practical consequence of Liking/ Loving Tendency is that it acts\nas a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend (l) to ignore\nfaults oi and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, (2) to favor\npeople, products, and actions merely associated with the object \nof his affection (as we shall see when we get to \"Influence-from-Mere-\nAssociation TendencY,\" and (3) to distort other facts to facilitate love. \n \nThe phenomenon of liking and loving causing\n\f\nadmiration also works in reverse. Admiration \nalso causes or intensifies liking or love. With this \"feedback mode\" in place,\nthe consequences are \noften extreme, sometimes even causing deliberate \nself-destruction to help what is loved. \n \nLiking or loving, intertwined with admiration in a feedback mode, often has\nvast practical consequences in areas far removed from sexual attachments.\nFor instance, a man who is so constructed \nthat he loves admirable persons and ideas with a special intensity has a huge\nadvantage in life. This blessing came to both Buffett and myself in large \nmeasure, sometimes from the same persons and \nideas. One common, beneficial example for us both \nwas Warren's uncle, Fred Buffett, who cheerfully did the endless grocery-\nstore work that Warren and I ended up admiring from a safe distance. Even\nnow, after I have known so many other people, I doubt if it is possible to be\na nicer man than Fred Buffett was, and he changed me for the better. \n \nThere are large social policy implications in the \namazingly good consequences that ordinarily come from people likely to\ntrigger extremes of love and \nadmiration boosting each other in a feedback mode. For instance, it is\nobviously desirable to attract a lot of lovable, admirable people into the\nteaching profession. \n \nThree: Disliking/Hating Tendency"

Even with the spread \nof religion, and the advent of advanced civilization, \nmuch modern war remains pretty savage. But we \nalso get what we observe in present-day Switzerland \nand the United States, wherein the clever political \narrangements of man \"channel\" the hatreds and \ndislikings of individuals and groups into nonlethal patterns including\nelections. \n \nBut the dislikings and harreds never go away \ncompletely. Born into man, these driving tendencies remain strong. Thus,\nwe get maxims like the \none from England: \"Politics is the art of marshalling \nhatreds.\" And we also get the extreme popularity of very negative political\nadvertising in the United \nStates.\n\f\nAt the family level, we often see one sibling \nhate his other siblings and litigate with them endlessly if he can afford it.\nIndeed, a wag named Buffett has repeatedly explained to me that \"a major\ndifference between rich and poor people is \nthat the rich people can spend their lives suing their \nrelatives.\" My father's law practice in Omaha was full of such intrafamily\nhatreds. And when I got to \nthe Harvard Law School and its professors taught \nme \"property law\" with no mention of sibling rivalry in the family business,\nI appraised the School as a pretty unrealistic place that wore \"blinders\" like\nthe milk-wagon horses of yore. My current guess is that sibling rivalry has\nnot yet made it into \nproperty law as taught at Harvard. \n \nDisliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that makes the\ndisliker hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike, (2) dislike \npeople, products, and actions merely associated \nwith the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other \nfacts to facilitate hatred. \n \nDistortion of that kind is often so extreme that \nmiscognition is shockingly large. When the World \nTrade Center was destroyed, many Pakistanis \nimmediately concluded that the Hindus did it, while many Muslims\nconcluded that the Jews did it. Such factual distortions often make"

    "raw_text": "The brain of man conserves programming space \nby being reluctant to change, which is a form of \ninconsistency avoidance. We see this in all human \nhabits, constructive and destructive. Few people \ncan list a lot of bad habits that they have eliminated, \nand some people cannot identify even one of these. Instead, practically\neveryone has a great many bad \nhabits he has long maintained despite their being known as bad. Given this\nsituation, it is not too \nmuch in many cases to appraise early-formed habits as destiny. When\nMarley's miserable ghost says, \"I wear the chains I forged in life,\" he is\ntalking about \nchains of habit that were too light to be felt before \nthey became too strong to be broken. \n \nThe rare life that is wisely lived has in it many \ngood habits maintained and many bad habits \navoided or cured. And the great rule that helps here \nis again from Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac: \"An ounce of prevention\nis worth a pound of cure.\" What Franklin is here indicating, in part, is that\nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency makes it much easier to prevent a habit\nthan to change it. \n \nAlso tending to be maintained in place by the \nanti-change tendency of the brain are one's previous\n\f\nconclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted\nrole in a civilization, etc. It is not entirely clear why evolution would\nprogram into man's brain an anti-change mode alongside his tendency to\nquickly remove doubt. My guess is \nthe anti-change mode was significantly caused by a \ncombination of the following factors: \n \n(1) It facilitated faster decisions when speed \nof decision was an important contribution to the \nsurvival of nonhuman ancestors that were prey. \n \n(2) It facilitated the survival advantage that our ancestors gained by\ncooperating in groups, which \nwould have been more difficult to do if everyone \nwas always changing responses. \n \n(3) It was the best form of solution that evolution could get to in the limited\nnumber of \ngenerations between the start of literacy and today's \ncomplex modern life. \n \nIt is easy to see that a quickly reached conclusion, triggered by Doubt-\nAvoidance Tendency, \nwhen combined with a tendency to resist any change in that conclusion, will\nnatUrally cause a lot of errors in cognition for modern man. And so it\n\f\nobservably works out. We all deal much with others whom we correctly\ndiagnose as imprisoned in poor \nconclusions that are maintained by mental habits they formed early and will\ncarry to their graves. \n \nSo great is the bad-decision problem caused by \nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency that our courts have adopted important\nstrategics against it. For instance, before making decisions, judges and\njuries are required to hear long and skillful presentations of evidence and\nargument from the side they will not naturally favor, given their ideas in\nplace. And \nthis helps prevent considerable bad thinking from \n\"first conclusion bias.\" Similarly, other modern \ndecision makers will often force groups to consider \nskillful counter arguments before making decisions. \n \nAnd proper education is one long exercise in \naugmentation of high cognition so that our wisdom becomes strong enough\nto destroy wrong thinking maintained by resistance to change. As Lord \nKeynes pointed out about his exalted intellectual \ngroup at one of the greatest universities in the world, it was not the intrinsic\ndifficulty of new ideas \nthat prevented their acceptance. Instead, the new \nideas were not accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in\nplace. What Keynes was reporting is that the human mind works a lot like\nthe human egg. When one sperm gets into a human\n\f\negg, there's an automatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from\ngetting in. The human mind \ntends strongly toward the same sort of result. \n \nAnd so, people tend to accumulate large mental \nholdings of fixed conclusions and attitudes that \nare not often reexamined or changed, even though \nthere is plenty of good evidence that they are \nwrong. \n \nMoreover, this doesn't just happen in social \nscience departments, like the one that once \nthought Freud should serve as the only choice as \na psychology teacher for Caltech. Holding to old errors even happens,\nalthough with less frequency \nand severity, in hard science departments. We have no less an authority for\nthis than Max Planck, Nobel \nlaureate, finder of \"Planck's constant.\" Planck is \nfamous not only for his science but also for saying \nthat even in physics the radically new ideas are seldom really accepted by\nthe old guard. Instead, \nsaid Planck, the progress is made by a new generation that comes along,\nless brain-blocked by its previous conclusions. Indeed, precisely this sort of\nbrain-blocking happened to a degree in Einstein. At his peak, Einstein was a\ngreat destroyer of his\n\f\nown ideas, but an older Einstein never accepted the full implications of\nquantum mechanics. \n \nOne of the most successful users of an antidote \nto first conclusion bias was Charles Darwin. He \ntrained himself, early, t<t intensively consider any \nevidence tending to disconfirm any hypothesis of his, more so if he thought\nhis hypothesis was a particularly good one. The opposite of what \nDarwin did is now called confirmation bias, a term of opprobrium. Darwin's\npractice came from his \nacute recognition of man's natural cognitive faults \narising from Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency. \nHe provides a great example of psychological \ninsight correctly used to advance some of the finest \nmental work ever done. \n \nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency has many good effects in civilization.\nFor instance, rather \nthan act inconsistently with public commitments, new or old public\nidentities, etc., most people are \nmore loyal in their roles in life as priests, physicians, \ncitizens, soldiers, spouses, teachers, employees, etc. \n \nOne corollary of Inconsistency-Avoidance \nTendency is that a person making big sacrifices in the course of assuming a\nnew identity will intensify his devotion to the new identity. After all, it\n\f\nwould be quite inconsistent behavior to make a large \nsacrifice for something that was no good. And thus civilization has invented\nmany tough and solemn \ninitiation ceremonies, often public in nature, that intensify new\ncommitments made. \n \nTough initiation ceremonies can intensify bad contact as well as good. The\nloyalty of the new, \"made-man\" mafia member of the military \nofficer making the required \"blood oath\" of loyalty to Hitler, was boosted\nthrough the triggering of \nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency. \n \nMoreover, the tendency will often make man a \"patsy\" of manipulative\n\"compliance-practitioners,\" who gain advantage from triggering his \nsubconscious Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency. \nFew people demonstrated this process better than Ben Franklin. As he was\nrising from obscurity in Philadelphia and wanted the approval of some \nimportant man, Franklin would often maneuver \nthat man into doing Franklin some unimportant favor like lending Franklin\na book. Thereafter the \nman would admire and trust Franklin more because \na non admitted and non trusted Franklin would be inconsistent with the\nappraisal implicit in lending \nFranklin the book.\n\f\nDuring the Korean War, this technique of Franklin's was the most important\nfeature of the \nChinese brainwashing system that was used on \nenemy prisoners. Small step by small step, the \ntechnique often worked better than torture in \naltering prisoner cognition in favor of Chinese \ncaptors. \n \nThe practice of Franklin, whereunder he got \napproval from someone by maneuvering him into treating Franklin\nfavorably, works viciously well in \nreverse. When one is maneuvered into deliberately \nhurting some other person, one will tend to disapprove or even hate that\nperson. This effect, from \nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, accounts for \nthe insight implicit in the saying: \"A man never \nforgets where he has buried the hatchet.\" The \neffect accounts for much prisoner abuse by gerards, \nincreasing their dislike and hatred for prisoners \nthat exists as a consequence of the guards' reciprocation of hostility from\nprisoners who are treated \nlike animals. Given the psychology-based hostility \nnatural in prisons between guards and prisoners, an intense, continuous\neffort should be made (1) to \nprevent prisoner abuse from starting and (2) to stop \nit instantly when it starts because it will grow by\n\f\nfeeding on itself, like a cluster of infectious disease. \nMore psychological acuity on this subject, aided by \nmore insightful teaching, would probably improve \nthe overall effectiveness of the U.S. Army. \n \nSo strong is Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency \nthat it will often prevail after one has merely \npretended to have some identity habit, or conclusion. Thus, for a while,\nmany an actor sort of \nbelieves he is Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. And \nmany a hypocrite is improved by his pretensions of virtue. And many a\njudge and juror, while \npretending objectivity, is gaining objectivity. And \nmany a trial lawyer or other advocate comes to \nbelieve what he formerly only pretended to believe. \n \nWhile Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, \nwith its \"status quo bias,\" immensely harms sound education. it also causes\nmuch benefit. For \ninstance, a near-ultimate inconsistency would be to \nteach something to others that one did not believe \ntrue. And so, in clinical medical education, the \nlearner is forced to \"see one, do one, and then teach \none,\" with the teaching pounding the learning into \nthe teacher. Of course, the power of teaching to \ninfluence the cognition of the teacher is not always"

And, \nas an obverse consequence of such \"fair-sharing\" \nconduct, much reactive hostility occurs when fair \nsharing is expected yet not provided. \n \nIt is interesting how the world's slavery was \npretty well abolished during the last three centuries \nafter being tolerated for a great many previous \ncenturies during which it coexisted with the world's \nmajor religions. My guess is that Kantian Fairness \nTendency was a major contributor to this result. \n \nEight: Envy/Jealousy Tendency \n \nA member of a species designed through evolutionary process to want\noften-scarce food is going \nto be driven strongly toward getting food when it first sees food. And this is\ngoing to occur often and \ntend to create some conflict when the food is seen \nin the possession of another member of the same species. This is probably\nthe evolutionary origin\n\f\nof the envy/jealousy Tendency that lies so deep in \nhuman nature. \n \nSibling jealousy is clearly very strong and usually greater in children than\nadults. It is often stronger than jealousy directed at strangers. Kantian \nFairness Tendency probably contributes to this \nresult. \n \nEnvy/jealousy is extreme in myth, religion, \nand literature wherein, in account after account, it triggers hatred and injury.\nIt was regarded as \nso pernicious by the Jews of the civilization that preceded Christ that it was\nforbidden, by phrase \nafter phrase, in the laws of Moses. You were even \nwarned by the Prophet not to covet your neighbor's \ndonkey. \n \nAnd envy/jealousy is also extreme in modern life. For instance, university\ncommunities often go \nbananas when some university employee in money \nmanagement, or some professor in surgery, gets \nannual compensation in multiples of the standard \nprofessorial salary. And in modern investment \nbanks, law firms, etc., the envy/jealousy effects are \nusually more extreme than they are in university \nfaculties. Many big law firms, fearing disorder from\n\f\nenvy/jealousy, have long treated all senior partners \nalike in compensation, no matter how different \ntheir contributions to firm welfare. As I have shared \nthe observation of life with Warren Buffett over decades, I have heard him\nwisely say on several occasions: \"It is not greed that drives the world, but \nenvy.\" \n \nAnd, because this is roughly right, one \nwould expect a vast coverage of envy/jealousy in \npsychology textbooks. But no such vast coverage existed when I read my\nthree textbooks. Indeed, \nthe very words \"envy\" and \"jealousy\" were often \nabsent from indexes. \n \nNon Discussion of envy/jealousy is not a \nphenomenon confined to psychology texts. When \ndid any of you last engage in any large group discussion of some issue\nwherein adult envy/jealousy was \nidentified as the cause of someone's argument? \nThere seems to be a general taboo against any such claim. If so, what\naccounts for the taboo? \n \nMy guess is that people widely and generally \nsense that labeling some position as driven by envy/ jealousy will be\nregarded as extremely insulting"

And if calling a position \"envy-driven\" is perceived as \nthe equivalent of describing its holder as a childish mental basket case, then\nit is quite understandable \nhow a general taboo has arisen. \n \nBut should this general taboo extend to psychology texts when it creates\nsuch a large gap \nin the correct, psychological explanation of what is \nwidespread and important? My answer is no. \n \nNine: Reciprocation Tendency \n \nThe automatic tendency of humans to reciprocate both favors and disfavors\nhas long been noticed as extreme, as it is in apes, monkeys, dogs, and many\nless cognitively gifted animals. The tendency \nclearly facilitates group cooperation for the benefit \nof members. In this respect, it mimics much \ngenetic programming of the social insects. \n \nWe see the extreme power of the tendency \nto reciprocate disfavors in some wars, wherein it increases hatred to a level\ncausing very brutal \nconduct. For long stretches in many wars, no \nprisoners were taken; the only acceptable enemy \nbeing a dead one. And sometimes that was not\n\f\nenough, as in the case of Genghis Khan, who was \nnot satisfied with corpses. He insisted on their \nbeing hacked into pieces. \n \nOne interesting mental exercise is to compare \nGenghis Khan, who exercised extreme, lethal \nhostility toward other men, with ants that display \nextreme, lethal hostility toward members of their \nown species that are not part of their breeding \ncolony. Genghis looks sweetly lovable when compared to the ants. The ants\nare more disposed \nto fight and fight with more extreme cruelty. \nIndeed, E. O. Wilson once waggishly suggested that \nif ants were suddenly to get atom bombs, all ants \nwould be dead within eighteen hours. What both \nhuman and ant history suggest is (1) that nature has \nno general algorithm making intraspecies, turn-the \nother-cheek behavior a booster of species survival, (2) that it is not clear\nthat a country would have \ngood prospects were it to abandon all reciprocate disfavor tendency directed\nat outsiders, and (3) if \nturn-the-other-cheek behavior is a good idea for a country as it deals with\noutsiders, man's culture is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting because\nhis \ngenes won't be of much help.\n\f\nI next turn to man's reciprocated hostility that \nfalls well short of war. Peacetime hostility can be \npretty extreme, as in many modern cases of \"road \nrage\" or injury-producing temper tantrums on \nathletic fields. \n \nThe standard antidote to one's overactive \nhostility is to train oneself to defer reaction. As my \nsmart friend Tom Murphy so frequently says, \"You can always tell the man\noff tomorrow if it is such a \ngood idea.\" \n \nOf course, the tendency to reciprocate favor for favor is also very intense,\nso much so that it occasionally reverses the course of reciprocated hostility. \nWeird pauses in fighting have sometimes occurred \nright in the middle of wars, triggered by some minor \ncourtesy or favor on the part of one side, followed \nby favor reciprocation from the other side, and so \non, until fighting stopped for a considerable period. \nThis happened more than once in the trench \nwarfare of World War I, over big stretches of the front and much to the\ndismay of the generals. \n \nIt is obvious that commercial trade, a fundamental cause of modern\nprosperity. is enormously\n\f\nfacilitated by man's innate tendency to reciprocate favors. In trade,\nenlightened self-interest joining \nwith Reciprocation Tendency results in constructive conduct. Daily\ninterchange in marriage is also \nassisted by Reciprocation Tendency, without which \nmarriage would lose much of its allure. \n \nAnd Reciprocation Tendency, insomuch as it causes good results, does not\njoin forces only with the superpower of incentives. It also joins\nInconsistency-Avoidance Tendency in helping cause (1) the \nfulfillment of promises made as part of a bargain, \nincluding loyalty promises in marriage ceremonies. \nand (2) correct behavior expected from persons \nserving as priests, shoemakers, physicians, and all \nelse. \n \nLike other psychological tendencies, and also \nman's ability to turn somersaults, reciprocate-favor \ntendency operates to a very considerable degree at a \nsubconscious level. This helps make the tendency \na strong force that can sometimes be used by some \nmen to mislead others, which happens all the time. \n \nFor instance, when an automobile salesman \ngraciously steers you into a comfortable place to sit and gives you a cup of\ncoffee, you are very likely\n\f\nbeing tricked, by this small courtesy alone, into \nparting with an extra five hundred dollars. This is \nfar from the most extreme case of sales success that is rooted in a salesman\ndispensing minor favors. \nHowever, in this scenario of buying a car, you are going to be\ndisadvantaged by parting with an extra \nfive hundred dollars of your own money. This \npotential loss will protect you to some extent. \n \nBut suppose you are the purchasing agent of someone else-a rich employer,\nfor instance. Now \nthe minor favor you receive from the salesman \nis less opposed by the threat of extra cost to you \nbecause someone else is paying the extra cost. \nUnder such circumstances, the salesman is often \nable to maximize his advantage, particularly when \ngovernment is the purchaser. \n \nWise employers, therefore, try to oppose reciprocate-favor tendencies of\nemployees engaged in \npurchasing. The simplest antidote works best: \nDon't let them accept any favors from vendors. \nSam Walton agreed with this idea of absolute prohibition. He wouldn't let\npurchasing agents \naccept so much as a hot dog from a vendor. Given\n\f\nthe subconscious level at which much Reciprocation Tendency operates,\nthis policy of Walton's was profoundly correct. If I controlled the Defense \nDepartment, its policies would mimic Walton's. \n \nIn a famous psychology experiment, Cialdini brilliantly demonstrated the\npower of \"compliance \npractitioners\" to mislead people by triggering their \nsubconscious Reciprocation Tendency. \n \nCarrying out this experiment, Cialdini caused \nhis \"compliance practitioners\" to wander around his \ncampus and ask strangers to supervise a bunch of juvenile delinquents on a\ntrip to a zoo. Because this \nhappened on a campus, one person in six out of a large \nsample actually agreed to do this. After accumulating this one-in-six\nstatistic, Cialdini changed his procedure. His practitioners next wandered\naround \nthe campus asking strangers to devote a big chunk \nof time every week for two years to the supervision of juvenile delinquents.\nThis ridiculous request \ngot him a one hundred percent rejection rate. But the practitioner had a\nfollow-up question: \"Will you at least spend one afternoon taking juvenile\ndelinquents to a zoo?\" This raised Cialdini's former acceptance rate of l/6 to\n1/2, a tripling. \n \nWhat Cialdini's \"compliance practitioners\"\n\f\nhad done was make a small concession, which was \nreciprocated by a small concession from the other side. This subconscious\nreciprocation of a concession by Cialdini's experimental subjects actually \ncaused a much increased percentage of them to end up irrationally agreeing\nto go to a zoo with juvenile \ndelinquents. Now, a professor who can invent an \nexperiment like that, which so powerfully demonstrates something so\nimportant, deserves much \nrecognition in the wider world, which he indeed \ngot to the credit of many universities that learned a \ngreat deal from Cialdini. \n \nWhy is Reciprocation Tendency so important? \nWell, consider the folly of having law students \ngraduate, and go out in the world representing \nclients in negotiations, not knowing the nature \nof the subconscious processes of the mind as \nexhibited in Cialdini's experiment. Yet such folly \nwas prevalent in the law schools of the world for \ndecades, in fact, generations. The correct name for \nthat is educational malpractice. The law schools \ndidn't know, or care to teach, what Sam Walton so \nwell knew. \n \nThe importance and power of reciprocate-favor\n\f\ntendency was also demonstrated in Cialdini's explanation of the foolish\ndecision of the attorney general \nof the United States to authorize the Watergate \nburglary. There, an aggressive subordinate made \nsome extreme proposal for advancing Republican interests through use of\nsome combination of whores and a gigantic yacht. When this ridiculous \nrequest was rejected, the subordinate backed off, \nin gracious concession, to merely asking for consent \nto a burglary, and the attorney general went along. \nCialdini believes that subconscious Reciprocation Tendency thus became\none important cause \nof the resignation of a United States president in the Watergate debacle, and\nso do I. Reciprocation Tendency subtly causes many extreme and dangerous\nconsequences, not just on rare occasions \nbut pretty much all the time. \n \nMan's belief in reciprocate-favor tendency, \nfollowing eons of his practicing it, has done some \nqueer and bad things in religions. The ritualized \nmurder of the Phoenicians and the Aztecs, in which \nthey sacrificed human victims to their gods, was a \nparticularly egregious example. And we should not \nforget that as late as the Punic Wars, the civilized \nRomans, out of fear of defeat, returned in a few instances to the practice of\nhuman sacrifice. On the \nother hand, the reciprocity-based, religion-boosting\n\f\nidea of obtaining help from God in reciprocation \nfor good human behavior has probably been vastly \nconstructive. \n \nOverall, both inside and outside religions, it \nseems clear to me that Reciprocation Tendency's \nconstructive contributions to man far outweigh \nits destructive effects. In cases of psychological \ntendencies being used to counter or prevent bad \nresults from one or more other psychological \ntendencies-for instance, in the case of interventions to end chemical\ndependency-you will usually \nfind Reciprocation Tendency performing strongly \non the constructive side. \n \nAnd the very best part of human life probably \nlies in relationships of affection wherein parties are more interested in\npleasing than being pleased-a \nnot uncommon outcome in display of reciprocate \nfavor tendency. \n \nBefore we leave reciprocate-favor tendency, \nthe final phenomenon we will consider is widespread human misery from\nfeelings of guilt. To the \nextent the feeling of guilt has an evolutionary base, I believe the most\nplausible cause is the mental\n\f\nconflict triggered in one direction by reciprocate \nfavor tendency and in the opposite direction by \nreward super response tendency pushing one to enjoy one hundred percent\nof some good thing. Of \ncourse, human culture has often greatly boosted \nthe genetic tendency to suffer from feelings of \nguilt. Most especially, religious culture has imposed \nhard-to-follow ethical and devotional demands on \npeople. There is a charming Irish Catholic priest in \nmy neighborhood who, with rough accuracy, often says, \"The old Jews may\nhave invented guilt, but we Catholics perfected it.\" And if you, like me and\nthis priest, believe that, averaged out, feelings of guilt do more good than\nharm, you may join in my \nspecial gratitude for reciprocate-favor tendency, no matter how unpleasant\nyou find feelings of guilt. \n \nTen: Influence -from-Mere-association Tendency \n \nIn the standard conditioned reflexes studied by \nSkinner and most common in the world, responsive \nbehavior, creating a new habit, is directly triggered \nby rewards previously bestowed. For instance, a \nman buys a can of branded shoe polish, has a good \nexperience with it when shining his shoes, and \nbecause of this \"reward,\" buys the same shoe polish \nwhen he needs another can.\n\f\nBut there is another type of conditioned reflex \nwherein mere association triggers a response. For \ninstance, consider the case of many men who \nhave been trained by their previous experience in \nlife to believe that when several similar items are presented for purchase,\nthe one with the highest price will have the highest quality. Knowing this,\nsome seller of an ordinary industrial product will often change his product's\ntrade dress and raise \nits price significantly hoping that quality-seeking buyers will be tricked into\nbecoming purchasers by \nmere association of his product and its high price. \n \nThis industrial practice frequently is effective in \ndriving up sales and even more so in driving up profits. For instance, it\nworked wonderfully with high-priced power tools for a long time. And it\nwould work better yet with high-priced pumps at \nthe bottom of oil wells. With luxury goods, the \nprocess works with a special boost because buyers \nwho pay high prices often gain extra status from \nthus demonstrating both their good taste and their \nability to pay. \n \nEven association that appears to be trivial, if \ncarefully planned, can have extreme and peculiar \neffects on purchasers of products.

    "raw_text": "purchaser of shoe polish may like pretty girls. And \nso he chooses the polish with the pretty girl on the can or the one with the\npretty girl in the last ad for \nshoe polish that he saw \n \nAdvertisers know about the power of mere association. You won't see Coke\nadvertised alongside \nsome account of the death of a child. Instead. Coke ads picture life as\nhappier than reality. \n \nSimilarly, it is not from mere chance that military bands play such\nimpressive music. That kind of music, appearing in mere association with\nmilitary service, helps to attract soldiers and keep \nthem in the army. Most armies have learned to use \nmere association in this successful way. \n \nHowever, the most damaging miscalculations \nfrom mere association do not ordinarily come from \nadvertisers and music providers. \nSome of the most important miscalculations \ncome from what is accidentally associated with \none's past success, or one's liking and loving, or \none's disliking and hating, which includes a natural \nhatred for bad news. \n \nTo avoid being misled by the mere association\n\f\nof some fact with past success, use this memory \nclue. Think of Napoleon and Hitler when they \ninvaded Russia after using their armies with \nmuch success elsewhere. And there are plenty \nof mundane examples of results like those of Napoleon and Hitler. For\ninstance, a man foolishly \ngambles in a casino and yet wins. This unlikely \ncorrelation causes him to try the casino again, or \nagain and again, to his horrid detriment. Or a man \ngets lucky in an odds-against venture headed by an untalented friend. So\ninfluenced, he tries again what worked before-with terrible results. \n \nThe proper antidotes to being made such a \npatsy by past success are (1) to carefully examine \neach past success, looking for accidental, non \ncausative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead as\none appraises odds implicit \nin a proposed new undertaking and (2) to look for \ndangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were \nnot present when past success occurred. \n \nThe damage to the mind that can come from \nliking and loving was once demonstrated by \nobviously false testimony given by an otherwise very admirable woman, the\nwife of a party in a jury \ncase. The famous opposing counsel wanted to\n\f\nminimize his attack on such an admirable woman \nyet destroy the credibility of her testimony. And so, \nin his closing argument, he came to her testimony \nlast. He then shook his head sadly and said, \"What \nare we to make of such testimony? The answer lies \nin the old rhyme: \n \n'As the husband is, \nSo the wife is. \nShe is married to a clown, \nAnd the grossness of his nature \nDrags her down.\"' \n \nThe jury disbelieved the woman's testimony. \nThey easily recognized the strong mis influence of \nlove on her cognition. And we now often see even \nstronger mis influence from love as tearful mothers, \nwith heartfelt conviction, declare before TV cameras \nthe innocence of their obviously guilty sons. \n \nPeople disagree about how much blindness \nshould accompany the association called love. In \nPoor Richard's Almanac Franklin counseled: \"Keep \nyour eyes wide open before marriage and half shut \nthereafter.\" Perhaps this \"eyes-half-shut\" solution\n\f\nis about right, but I favor a tougher prescription: \"See it like it is and love\nanyway.\" \n \nHating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere\nassociation. In business, \nI commonly see people under appraise both the \ncompetency and morals of competitors they dislike. \nThis is a dangerous practice, usually disguised \nbecause it occurs on a subconscious basis. \n \nAnother common bad effect from the mere association of a person and a\nhated outcome is displayed \nin \"Persian Messenger Syndrome.\" Ancient \nPersians actually killed some messengers whose \nsole fault was that they brought home truthful bad news, say, of a battle lost.\nIt was actually safer for \nthe messenger to run away and hide, instead of doing his job as a wiser boss\nwould have wanted it \ndone. \n \nAnd Persian Messenger Syndrome is alive and \nwell in modern life, albeit in less lethal versions. It is actually dangerous in\nmany careers co be a \ncarrier of unwelcome news. Union negotiators \nand employer representatives often know this, and it leads to many\ntragedies in labor relations.\n\f\nSometimes lawyers, knowing their clients will \nhate them if they recommend an unwelcome but \nwise settlement, will carry on to disaster. Even \nin places well known for high cognition, one will \nsometimes find Persian Messenger Syndrome. \nFor instance, years ago, two major oil companies \nlitigated in a Texas trial court over some ambiguity \nin an operating agreement covering one of the \nlargest oil reservoirs in the Western hemisphere. \nMy guess is that the cause of the trial was some general counsel's\nunwillingness to carry bad news to \na strong-minded CEO. \n \nCBS, in its late heyday, was famous for occurrence of Persian Messenger\nSyndrome because \nChairman Paley was hostile to people who brought him bad news. The\nresult was that Paley lived in \na cocoon of unreality, from which he made one bad \ndeal after another, even exchanging a large share of \nCBS for a company that had to be liquidated shortly \nthereafter. \n \nThe proper antidote to creating Persian \nMessenger Syndrome and its bad effects, like those \nat CBS, is to develop, through exercise of will, a \nhabit of welcoming bad news. At Berkshire, there is\n\f\na common injunction: \"Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the\ngood news that can wait.\" It also helps to be so wise and informed that\npeople \nfear not telling you bad news because you are so \nlikely to get it elsewhere. \n \nInfluence-from-Mere-Association Tendency \noften has a shocking effect that helps swamp \nthe normal tendency to return favor for favor. \nSometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition \nis unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something else. In\naddition, the favor may \ntrigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who \nwas in so favorable a state that he could easily be \na favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor \nreceiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with past\npain, will not only dislike \nthe man who helped him but also try to injure him. \nThis accounts for a famous response, sometimes \ndubiously attributed to Henry Ford: \"Why does that man hate me so? I\nnever did anything for him.\" I have a friend, whom I will now call \"Glotz,\"\nwho \nhad an amusing experience in favor-giving. Glotz \nowned an apartment building that he had bought \nbecause he wanted, eventually, to use the land in \ndifferent development. Pending this outcome,\n\f\nGlotz was very lenient in collecting below-market \nrents from tenants. When, at last, there was a public hearing on Glotz's\nproposal to tear down the \nbuilding, one tenant who was far behind in his rent \npayments was particularly angry and hostile. He came to the public hearing\nand said, \"This proposal \nis outrageous. Glotz doesn't need any more money. I know this because I\nwas supported in college by \nGlotz fellowships.\" \n \nA final serious clump of bad thinking caused by \nmere association lies in the common use of classification stereotypes.\nBecause Pete knows that Joe is ninety years old and that most ninety-year-\nold persons don't think very well, Pete appraises old Joe as a thinking klutz\neven if old Joe still thinks very well. Or, because Jane is a white-haired\nwoman, and Pete knows no old women good at higher math, Pete appraises\nJane as no good at it even if Jane is a whiz. This sort of wrong thinking is\nboth natural \nand common. Pete's antidote is not to believe that, \non average, ninety-year-olds think as well as forty \nyear-olds or that there are as many females as males among Ph. D.'s in\nmath. Instead, just as he must \nlearn that trend does not always correctly predict destiny, he must learn that\nthe average dimension in some group will not reliably guide him to the\ndimension of some specific item. Otherwise Pete will make many errors,\n\f\nlike that of the fellow who drowned in a river that averaged out only\neighteen \ninches deep. \n \nEleven: Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial \n \n487 \n \nThis phenomenon first hit me hard in World War II when the super athlete,\nsuperstudent son \nof a family friend flew off over the Atlantic Ocean \nand never came back. His mother, who was a very \nsane woman, then refused to believe he was dead. \nThat's Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial. The reality is too\npainful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable. We all\ndo that to some extent, often causing terrible problems. The \ntendency’s most extreme outcomes are usually mixed \nup with love, death, and chemical dependency. \n \nWhere denial is used to make dying easier, the conduct meets almost no\ncriticism. Who would \nbegrudge a fellow man such help at such a time? But some people hope to\nleave life hewing to the iron prescription, \"It is not necessary to hope \nin order to persevere.\" And there is something \nadmirable in anyone able to do this.\n\f\nIn chemical dependency, wherein morals \nusually break down horribly, addicted persons tend \nto believe that they remain in respectable condition, with respectable\nprospects. They thus display an extremely unrealistic denial of reality as\nthey go deeper and deeper into deterioration. In my \nyouth, Freudian remedies failed utterly in reversing \nchemical dependency, but nowadays Alcoholics Anonymous routinely\nachieves a fifty percent cure \nrate by causing several psychological tendencies \nto act together to counter addiction. However, the cure process is typically\ndifficult and draining, and a fifty percent success rate implies a fifty percent\nfailure rate. One should stay far away from any conduct at all likely to drift\ninto chemical dependency. Even a small chance of suffering so great a \ndamage should be avoided. \n \nTwelve: Excessive Self-Regard Tendency \n \nWe all commonly observe the excessive self \nregard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on \nthe high side, like the ninety percent of Swedish drivers that judge\nthemselves to be above average. \nSuch mis appraisals also apply to a person's major \n\"possessions.\" One spouse usually over appraises \nthe other spouse. And a man's children are likewise appraised higher by him\nthan they are likely to be in a more objective view. Even man's minor \npossessions tend to be over appraised. Once owned,"

    "raw_text": "they suddenly become worth more to him than he \nwould pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn't already own\nthem. There is a name in psychology for this over appraise-your-own-\npossessions phenomenon: the \"endowment effect.\" And \nall man's decisions are suddenly regarded by him as better than would have\nbeen the case lust before he made them. \n \nMan's excess of self-regard typically makes him strongly prefer people like\nhimself. Psychology \nprofessors have had much fun demonstrating this effect in \"lost-wallet\"\nexperiments. Their \nexperiments all show that the finder of a lost wallet containing identity\nclues will be most likely to \nreturn the wallet when the owner most closely \nresembles the finder. Given this quality in psychological nature, cliquish\ngroups of similar persons will always be a very influential part of human\nculture, \neven after we wisely try to dampen the worst \neffects. \n \nSome of the worst consequences in modern life come when dysfunctional\ngroups of cliquish \npersons, dominated by Excessive Self-Regard \nTendency, select as new members of their organizations persons who are\nvery much like themselves. Thus if the English department at an elite\nuniversity becomes mentally dysfunctional or the sales\n\f\ndepartment of a brokerage firm slips into routine fraud, the problem will\nhave a natural tendency \nto get worse and to be quite resistant to change for the better. So also with a\npolice department \nor prison-guard unit or political group gone sour \nand countless other places mired in evil and folly, such as the worst of our\nbig-city teachers' unions that harm our children by preventing discharge of\nineffective teachers. Therefore, some of the most \nuseful members of our civilization are those who are willing to \"clean\nhouse\" when they find a mess \nunder their ambit of control. \n \nWell, naturally, all forms of excess of self-regard cause much error. How\ncould it be otherwise? \nLet us consider some foolish gambling \ndecisions. In lotteries, the play is much lower when \nnumbers are distributed randomly than it is when \nthe player picks his own number. This is quite irrational. The odds are\nalmost exactly the same and much against the player. Because state\nlotteries \ntake advantage of man's irrational love of self picked numbers, modern man\nbuys more lottery \ntickets than he otherwise would have. with each \npurchase foolish. \n \nIntensify man's love of his own conclusions by\n\f\nadding the possessory wallop from the \"endowment effect,\" and you will\nfind that a man who has already \nbought a pork-belly future on a commodity exchange \nnow foolishly believes, even more strongly than \nbefore, in the merits of his speculative bet. \n \nAnd foolish sports betting, by people who love sports and think they know\na lot about relative \nmerits of teams, is a lot more addictive than race track betting-partly\nbecause of man's automatic \nOver appraisal of his own complicated conclusions. \n \nAlso extremely counterproductive is man's \ntendency to bet, time after time, in games of skill, \nlike golf or poker, against people who are obviously \nmuch better players. Excessive Self-Regard \nTendency diminishes the foolish bettor's accuracy \nin appraising his relative degree of talent. \n \nMore counterproductive yet are man's appraisals, typically excessive, of the\nquality of the \nfuture service he is to provide to his business. His over appraisal of these\nprospective contributions will \nfrequently cause disaster. \n \nExcesses of self-regard often cause bad hiring\n\f\ndecisions because employers grossly over appraise \nthe worth of their own conclusions that rely on impressions in face-to-face\ncontact. The correct \nantidote to this sort of folly is to underweigh face \nto-face impressions and overweigh the applicant's \npast record. \n \nI once chose exactly this course of action \nwhile I served as chairman of an academic search committee. I convinced\nfellow committee \nmembers to stop all further interviews and simply \nappoint a person whose achievement record was \nmuch better than that of any other applicant. And when it was suggested to\nme that I wasn't giving \"academic due process,\" I replied that I was the one\nbeing true to academic values because I was using academic research\nshowing poor predictive value of \nimpressions from face-to-face interviews. \n \nBecause man is likely to be over influenced by \nface-to-face impressions that by definition involve his active participation, a\njob candidate who is a \nmarvelous \"presenter\" often causes great danger under modern executive-\nsearch practice. In my opinion, Hewlett-Packard faced just such a danger\nwhen it interviewed the articulate, dynamic Carly Fiorina in its search for a\nnew CEO. And I believe \n(1) that Hewlett-Packard made a bad decision when\n\f\nit chose Ms. Fiorina and Q) that this bad decision would not have been\nmade if Hewlett-Packard had \ntaken the methodological precautions it would have taken if it knew more\npsychology. \n \nThere is a famous passage somewhere in \nTolstoy that illuminates the power of Excessive \nSelf-Regard Tendency. According to Tolstoy, the \nworst criminals don't appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to\nbelieve either (1) that they didn't commit their crimes or (2) that,\nconsidering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is \nunderstandable and forgivable that they behaved as \nthey did and became what they became. \n \nThe second half of the \"Tolstoy effect\", where the man makes excuses for\nhis fixable poor performance, instead of providing the fix, is enormously\nimportant. Because a majority of mankind will try \nto get along by making way too many unreasonable excuses for fixable\npoor performance, it is very important to have personal and institutional\nantidotes limiting the ravages of such folly. On the personal level a man\nshould try to face the two simple facts: (1) fixable but unfixed bad\nperformance is bad character and tends to create more \nof itself, causing more damage to the excuse giver with each tolerated\ninstance, and (2) in demanding places, like athletic teams and General\nElectric,\n\f\nyou are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving\nexcuses instead of behaving as you should. The main institutional antidotes\nto this part of the \"Tolstoy effect\" are (1) a fair, meritocratic, demanding\nculture plus personnel handling \nmethods that build up morale and (2) severance \nof the worst offenders. Of course, when you can't \nsever, as in the case of your own child, you must try to fix the child as best\nyou can. I once heard of \na child-teaching method so effective that the child remembered the learning\nexperience over fifty years later. The child later became Dean of the \nUSC School of Music and then related to me what \nhis father said when he saw his child taking candy \nfrom the stock of his employer with the excuse that \nhe intended to replace it later. The father said, \"Son, it would be better for\nyou to simply take all you want \nand call yourself a thief every time you do it\" \n \nThe best antidote to folly from an excess of \nself-regard is to force yourself to be more objective \nwhen you are thinking about yourself, your family \nand friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity.\nThis isn't easy to do well \nand won't work perfectly, but it will work much \nbetter than simply letting psychological nature take \nits normal course."

This factor accounts for the adage: \"Never\nunderestimate the man who \noverestimates himself.\" \n \nOf course, some high self-appraisals are correct \nand serve better than false modesty.

    "raw_text": "Demosthenes, the most famous Greek orator, said. \"What a man wishes,\nthat also will he believe.\" \n \nDemosthenes, parsed out, was thus saying \nthat man displays not only Simple, Pain-Avoiding \nPsychological Denial but also an excess of optimism \neven when he is already doing well. \n \nThe Greek orator was clearly right about \nan excess of optimism being the normal human \ncondition, even when pain or the threat of pain \nis absent. Witness happy people buying lottery \ntickets or believing that credit-furnishing, delivery \nmaking grocery stores were going to displace a great \nmany superefficient cash-and-carry supermarkets. \n \nOne standard antidote to foolish optimism is \ntrained, habitual use of the simple probability math \nof Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high \nschool sophomores.

They resemble\nthe dysfunctional golf \ngrip you would have if you relied on a grip driven \nby evolution instead of golf lessons. \n \nFourteen: Deprival- Super Reaction Tendency\n\f\nThe quantity of man's pleasure from a ten dollar gain does not exactly\nmatch the quantity of \nhis displeasure from a ten-dollar loss. That is, the \nloss seems to hurt much more than the gain seems \nto help. Moreover, if a man almost gets something he greatly wants and has\nit jerked away from him at the last moment, he will react much as if he had\nlong owned the reward and had it jerked away. I include the natural human\nreactions to both kinds \nof loss experience-the loss of the possessed reward and the loss of the\nalmost-possessed reward-under \none description, Deprival-Super Reaction Tendency. \n \nIn displaying Deprival-Super Reaction Tendency, \nman frequently incurs disadvantage by misframing his problems. He will\noften compare what is near \ninstead of what really matters. For instance, a man with $10 million in his\nbrokerage account will often be extremely irritated by the accidental loss of\n$100 out of the $300 in his wallet. \n \nThe Mungers once owned a tame and good natured dog that displayed the\ncanine version of \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency. There was only \none way to get bitten by this dog. And that was \nto try and take some food away from him after he already had it in his\nmouth. If you did that, this friendly dog would automatically bite. He\n\f\ncouldn't help it. Nothing could be more stupid than for the dog to bite his\nmaster. But the dog couldn't \nhelp being foolish. He had an automatic Deprival \nSuper Reaction Tendency in his nature. \n \nHumans are much the same as this Munger dog. \nA man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to \neven a small loss, or threatened loss, of property, \nlove, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, \nstatus, or any other valued thing. As a natural \nresult, bureaucratic infighting over the threatened \nloss of dominated territory often causes immense damage to an institution\nas a whole. This factor, among others, accounts for much of the wisdom of\nJack Welch's long fight against bureaucratic ills at General Electric. Few\nbusiness leaders have ever \nconducted wiser campaigns. \n \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency often \nprotects ideological or religious views by triggering \ndislike and hatred directed toward vocal nonbelievers. This happens, in part,\nbecause the ideas of the nonbelievers, if they spread, will diminish \nthe influence of views that are now supported \nby a comfortable environment including a strong \nbelief-maintenance system. University Liberal \narts departments, law schools, and business organizations all display plenty\nof such ideology-based group think that rejects almost all conflicting"

    "raw_text": "inputs. \nWhen the vocal critic is a former believer, hostility \nis often boosted both by (1) a concept of betrayal \nthat triggers additional Deprival-Super Reaction \nTendency because a colleague is lost and (2) fears that conflicting views\nwill have extra persuasive \npower when they come from a former colleague. The foregoing\nconsiderations help account for the old idea of heresy, which for centuries\njustified \nmuch killing of heretics, frequently after torture \nand frequently accomplished by burning the victim \nalive. \n \nIt is almost everywhere the case that extremes \nof ideology are maintained with great intensity \nand with great antipathy to non-believers, causing \nextremes of cognitive dysfunction. This happens, I believe, because two\npsychological tendencies are usually acting concurrently toward this same\nsad result: ( I ) Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, plus (2) Deprival-Super\nReaction Tendency. \n \nOne antidote to intense, deliberate maintenance of group think is an\nextreme culture of courtesy, kept in place despite ideological differences,\nlike the behavior of the justices now serving on the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAnother antidote is to\n\f\ndeliberately bring in able and articulate disbelievers of incumbent group\nthink. Successful corrective \nmeasures to evil examples of group think maintenance have included\nactions like that of Derek Bok \nwhen, as president of Harvard, he started disapproving tenure appointments\nproposed by ideologues at Harvard Law School. \n \nEven a one-degree loss from a 1SO-degree view will sometime create\nenough Deprival-Super reaction Tendency to turn a neighbor into an enemy,\nas I once observed when I bought a house from one \nof two neighbors locked into hatred by a tiny tree \nnewly installed by one of them. \n \nAs the case of these two neighbors illustrated, \nthe clamor of almost any group of neighbors \ndisplaying irrational, extreme deprival-super reaction over some trifle in a\nzoning hearing is not a pretty thing to watch. Such bad behavior drives\nsome people from the zoning field. I once bought \nsome golf clubs from an artisan who was formerly a lawyer. When I asked\nhim what kind of law he had practiced, I expected to hear him say, \"divorce\nlaw.\" \nBut his answer was, \"zoning law.\" \n \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency has ghastly \neffects in labor relations. Most of the deaths in the labor strife that occurred\nbefore World War I came\n\f\nwhen employers tried to reduce wages. Nowadays, \nwe see fewer deaths and more occasions when \nwhole companies disappear. as competition requires either takeaways from\nlabor-which it will not consent to-or death of the business. Deprival \nSuper Reaction Tendency causes much of this labor \nresistance, often in cases where it would be in \nlabor's interest to make a different decision. \n \nIn contexts other than labor relations, takeaways are also difficult to get.\nMany tragedies, therefore, \noccur that would have been avoided had there been \nmore rationality and less subconscious heed of the \nimperative from Deprival-Super Reaction Tendency. \n \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency is also a huge \ncontributor to ruin from compulsion to gamble. \nFirst, it causes the gambler to have a passion to \nget even once he has suffered loss, and the passion \ngrows with the loss. Second, the most addictive \nforms of gambling provide a lot of near misses and \neach one triggers Deprival-Super Reaction Tendency. \nSome slot machine creators are vicious in exploiting \nthis weakness of man. Electronic machines enable \nthese creators to produce a lot of meaningless bar \nbar-lemon results that greatly increase play by fools \nwho think they have very nearly won large rewards.\n\f\nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency often does \nmuch damage to man in open-outcry auctions. The \"social proof' that we\nwill next consider tends \nto convince man that the last price from another \nbidder was reasonable, and then Deprival-Super \nreaction Tendency prompts him strongly to top the last bid. The best\nantidote to being thus triggered \ninto paying foolish prices at open-outcry auctions \nis the simple Buffett practice: Don't go to such \nauctions. \n \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency and Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency\noften join to cause one form of business failure. In this form of ruin, \na man gradually uses up all his good assets in a \nfruitless attempt to rescue a big venture going bad. \nOne of the best antidotes to this folly is good poker \nskill learned young. The teaching value of poker \ndemonstrates that not all effective teaching occurs on a standard academic\npath. \n \nI myself, the would-be instructor here, many \ndecades ago made a big mistake caused in part by \nsubconscious operation of my Deprival-Super reaction Tendency. A\nfriendly broker called and offered\n\f\nme 300 shares of ridiculously underpriced, very thinly traded Belridge Oil\nat $115 per share, which I purchased using cash I had on hand. The next\nday, \nhe offered me 1,500 more shares at the same price, which I declined to buy\npartly because I could only have made the purchase had I sold something or\nborrowed the required $173,000. This was a very irrational decision. I was a\nwell-to-do man with \nno debt; there was no risk of loss; and similar no risk opportunities were not\nlikely to come along. \nWithin two years, Belridge Oil sold out to Shell at a price of about $3,700\nper share, which made me about $5.4 million poorer than I would have been\nhad I then been psychologically acute. As this tale \ndemonstrates, psychological ignorance can be very \nexpensive. \n \nSome people may question my defining \nDeprival-Super Reaction Tendency to include reaction to profit barely\nmissed, as in the well \ndocumented responses of slot machine players. However, I believe that I\nhaven't defined the tendency as broadly as I should. My reason for \nsuggesting an even broader definition is that many Berkshire Hathaway\nshareholders I know never sell \nor give away a single share after immense gains in \nmarket value have occurred. Some of this reaction \nis caused by rational calculation, and some is, no"

    "raw_text": "doubt, attributable to some combination of (1) reward super response, (2)\n\"status quo bias\" from Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, and (3) \"The \nendowment effect\" from Excessive Self-Regard Tendency. But I believe the\nsingle strongest \nirrational explanation is a form of Deprival-Super \nreaction Tendency. Many of these shareholders \nsimply can't stand the idea of having their Berkshire \nHathaway holdings smaller. Partly they dislike \nfacing what they consider an impairment of identity, \nbut mostly they fear missing out on future gains \nfrom stock sold or given away. \n \nFifteen: Social-Proof Tendency \n \nThe otherwise complex behavior of man is \nmuch simplified when he automatically thinks and \ndoes what he observes to be thought and done around him. And such\nfollowership often works fine. For instance, what simpler way could there\nbe to find out how to walk to a big football game in a \nstrange city than by following the flow of the crowd. \nFor some such reason, man's evolution left him with \nSocial-Proof Tendency, an automatic tendency to think and act as he sees\nothers around him thinking \nand acting. \n \nPsychology professors love Social-Proof\n\f\nTendency because in their experiments it causes \nridiculous results. For instance, if a professor \narranges for some stranger to enter an elevator \nwherein ten \"compliance practitioners\" are all \nsilently standing so that they face the rear of the \nelevator, the stranger will often turn around and do \nthe same. The psychology professors can also use \nSocial-Proof Tendency to cause people to make \nlarge and ridiculous measurement errors. \n \nAnd, of course, teenagers' parents usually \nlearn more than they would like about teenagers' \ncognitive errors from Social-Proof Tendency. This \nphenomenon was recently involved in a break \nthrough by Judith Rich Harris who demonstrated that superrespect by\nyoung people for their peers, \nrather than for parents or other adults, is ordained to some considerable\nextent by the genes of the young people. This makes it wise for parents to\nrely \nmore on manipulating the quality of the peers than \non exhortations to their own offspring. A person like Ms. Harris, who can\nprovide an insight of this \nquality and utility, backed by new reasons, has not \nlived in vain. \n \nAnd in the highest reaches of business, it is\n\f\nnot all uncommon to find leaders who display followership akin to that of\nteenagers . If one oil \ncompany foolishly buys a mine, other oil companies often quickly join in\nbuying mines. So also if the \npurchased company makes fertilizer. Both of these \noil company buying fads actually bloomed, with bad \nresults. \n \nOf course, it is difficult to identify and correctly \nweigh all the possible ways to deploy the cash flow \nof an oil company. So oil company executives, like \neveryone else, have made many bad decisions that were quickly triggered\nby discomfort from doubt. \nGoing along with social proof provided by the \naction of other oil companies ends this discomfort in \na natural way. \n \nWhen will Social-Proof Tendency be most easily triggered. Here the answer\nis clear from many \nexperiments: Triggering most readily occurs in the \npresence of puzzlement or stress, and particularly \nwhen both exist. \n \nBecause stress intensifies Social-Proof \nTendency, disreputable sales organizations, \nengaged, for instance, in such action as selling\n\f\nswampland to schoolteachers, manipulate targets \ninto situations combining isolation and stress. The \nisolation strengthens the social proof provided by \nboth the knaves and the people who buy first, and \nthe stress, often increased by fatigue, augments the targets' susceptibility to\nthe social proof. And, of \ncourse, the techniques of our worst \"religious\" cults \nimitate those of the knavish salesmen. One cult \neven used rattlesnakes to heighten the stress felt by \nconversion targets. \n \nBecause both bad and good behavior are made \ncontagious by Social-Proof Tendency, it is highly \nimportant that human societies (1) stop any bad behavior before it spreads\nand (2) foster and display \nall good behavior. \n \nMy father once told me that just after \ncommencing law practice in Omaha, he went with \na large group from Nebraska to South Dakota to hunt pheasants. A South\nDakota hunting license \nwas, say, $2 for South Dakota residents and $5 for nonresidents. All the\nNebraska residents, one \nby one, signed up for South Dakota licenses with phony South Dakota\naddresses until it was my father's turn. \nThen, according to him, he barely\n\f\nprevented himself from doing what the others were \ndoing, which was some sort of criminal offense. \n \nNot everyone so resists the social contagion of \nbad behavior. And, therefore, we often get \"Serpico \nSyndrome,\" named to commemorate the state of a near-totally corrupt New\nYork police division joined \nby Frank Serpico. He was then nearly murdered by gunfire because of his\nresistance to going along with \nthe corruption in the division. Such corruption was \nbeing driven by social proof plus incentives, the combination that creates\nSerpico Syndrome. The Serpico story should be taught more than it now is \nbecause the didactic power of its horror is aimed at \na very important evil, driven substantially by a very \nimportant force: social proof. \n \nIn social proof, it is not only action by others that misleads but also their\ninaction. In the \npresence of doubt, inaction by others becomes \nsocial proof that inaction is the right course. Thus, \nthe inaction of a great many bystanders led to the death of Kitty Genovese\nin a famous incident much \ndiscussed in introductory psychology courses. \n \nIn the ambit of social proof, the outside"

They fail to object to anything much short of an axe murder until\nsome \npublic embarrassment of the board finally causes \ntheir intervention. A typical board-of-directors' culture was once well\ndescribed by my friend, Joe Rosenfield, as he said, \"They asked me if I\nwanted to become a director of Northwest Bell, and it was \nthe last thing they ever asked me.\" \n \nIn advertising and sales promotion, Social-Proof \nTendency is about as strong a factor as one could \nimagine. \"Monkey-see, monkey-do\" is the old phrase that reminds one of\nhow strongly John will \noften wish to do something, or have something, just because Joe does or has\nit. One interesting consequence is that an advertiser will pay a lot to have \nits soup can, instead of someone else's, in a movie scene involving soup\nconsumption only in a peripheral way. \n \nSocial-Proof Tendency often interacts in a perverse way with Envy/Jealousy\nand Deprival \nSuper Reaction Tendency. One such interaction \namused my family for years as people recalled the time when my cousin\nRuss and I, at ages three \nand four, fought and howled over a single surplus \nshingle while surrounded by a virtual sea of surplus \nshingles.\n\f\nBut the adult versions of this occasion, boosted \nby psychological tendencies preserving ideologies, \nare not funny and can bring down whole civilizations. The Middle East now\npresents just such a threat. By now the resources spent by Jews, Arabs and\nall others over a small amount of disputed land \nif divided arbitrarily among land claimants, would \nhave made everyone better off, even before taking \ninto account any benefit from reduced threat of war, \npossibly nuclear. \n \nOutside domestic relations it is rare now to try to resolve disputes by\ntechniques including discussion of impacts from psychological tendencies. \nConsidering the implications of childishness that \nwould be raised by such inclusion, and the defects \nof psychology as now taught, this result may be \nsound. But, given the nuclear stakes now involved and the many failures in\nimportant negotiations lasting decades, I often wonder if some day, in some \nway, more use of psychological insight will eventually improve outcomes.\nIf so, correct teaching of psychology matters a lot. And, if old psychology \nprofessors are even less likely than old physics \nprofessors to learn new ways, which seems nearly \ncertain, then we may, as Max Planck predicted, \nneed a new generation of psychology professors \nwho have grown up to think in a different way.\n\f\nIf only one lesson is to be chosen from a package of lessons involving\nSocial-Proof Tendency, \nand used in self improvement, my favorite would \nbe: Learn how to ignore the examples from others \nwhen they are wrong, because few skills are more \nworth having. \n \nSixteen: Contrast-Misreaction Tendency \n \nBecause the nervous system of man does not naturally measure in absolute\nscientific units, it must instead rely on something simpler. The eyes \nhave a solution that limits their programming needs: \nthe contrast in what is seen is registered. And as in sight, so does it go,\nlargely, in the other senses. \nMoreover as perception goes, so goes cognition. The result is man's\nContrast-MisReaction Tendency. \n \nFew psychological tendencies do more damage to correct thinking. Small-\nscale damages involve \ninstances such as man's buying an overpriced \n$1,000 leather dashboard merely because the price is so low compared to\nhis concurrent purchase of \na $65,000 car. Large- scale damages often ruin \nlives, as when a wonderful woman having terrible parents marries a man\nwho would be judged satisfactory only in comparison to her parents.

A buyer from out of the city, perhaps \nneeding to shift his family there, visits the office with little time available.\nThe salesman deliberately shows the customer three awful houses at \nridiculously high prices. Then he shows him a \nmerely bad house at a price only moderately too high. And, boom, the\nbroker often makes an easy \nsale. \n \nContrast-Misreaction Tendency is routinely \nused to cause disadvantage for customers buying \nmerchandise and services. To make an ordinary price seem low, the vendor\nwill very frequently \ncreate a highly artificial price that is much higher \nthan the price always sought, then advertise his \nstandard price as a big reduction from his phony price. Even when people\nknow that this sort of \ncustomer manipulation is being attempted, it will \noften work to trigger buying. This phenomenon \naccounts in part for much advertising in newspapers.

    "raw_text": "extreme reaction. And everyone who has taken \nPsych 101 knows that stress makes Social-Proof \nTendency more powerful. \n \nIn a phenomenon less well recognized but still \nwidely known, light stress can slightly improve \nperformance-say, in examinations-whereas heavy \nstress causes dysfunction. \n \nBut few people know more about really heavy \nstress than that it can cause depression. For \ninstance, most people know that an \"acute stress \ndepression\" makes thinking dysfunctional because \nit causes an extreme of pessimism, often extended \nin length and usually accompanied by activity \nstopping fatigue. Fortunately, as most people also \nknow, such a depression is one of mankind's more \nreversible ailments. Even before modern drugs \nwere available, many people afflicted by depression, \nsuch as Winston Churchill and Samuel Johnson, \ngained great achievement in life. \n \nMost people know very little about nondepressive mental breakdowns\ninfluenced by heavy \nstress. But there is at least one exception, involving \nthe work of Pavlov when he was in his seventies\n\f\nand eighties. Pavlov had won a Nobel Prize early \nin life by using dogs to work out the physiology of digestion. Then he\nbecame world-famous by \nworking out mere-association responses in dogs, \ninitially salivating dogs-so much so that changes in \nbehavior triggered by mere-association, like those \ncaused by much modern advertisement, are today \noften said to come from \"Pavlovian\" conditioning. \n \nWhat happened to cause Pavlov's last work was \nespecially interesting. During the great Leningrad \nFlood of the 1920s, Pavlov had many dogs in cages. Their habits had been\ntransformed, by a combination of his \"Pavlovian conditioning\" plus\nstandard \nreward responses, into distinct and different \npatterns. As the waters of the flood came up and \nreceded, many dogs reached a point where they had \nalmost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. This\nsubjected them to maximum \nstress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed \nthat many of the dogs were no longer behaving as they had. The dog that\nformerly had liked his trainer now disliked him, for example. This result \nreminds one of modern cognition reversals in which \na person's love of his parents suddenly becomes \nhate, as new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult. The unanticipated,\nextreme changes in\n\f\nPavlov's dogs would have driven any good experimental scientist into a\nnear-frenzy of curiosity. That \nwas indeed Pavlov's reaction. But not many scientists would have done\nwhat Pavlov next did. \n \nAnd that was to spend the rest of his long life \ngiving stress-induced nervous breakdowns to dogs, \nafter which he would try to reverse the break \ndowns, all the while keeping careful experimental records. He found (1)\nthat he could classify dogs \nso as to predict how easily a particular dog would breakdown (2) that the\ndogs hardest to break \ndown were also the hardest to return to their pre \nbreakdown state; (3) that any dog could be broken \ndown; and (4) that he couldn't reverse a breakdown \nexcept by reimposing stress. \n \nNow, practically everyone is revolted by such \nexperimental treatment of man's friend, the dog. \nMoreover, Pavlov was Russian and did his last \nwork under the Communists. And maybe those \nfacts account for the present extreme, widespread ignorance of Pavlov's last\nwork. The two Freudian psychiatrists with whom I tried many years ago to\ndiscuss this work had never heard of it. And \nthe dean of a major medical school actually asked\n\f\nme, several years ago, if any of Pavlov's experiments were \"repeatable\" in\nexperiments of other researchers. Obviously, Pavlov is now a sort of \nforgotten hero in medical science. \n \nI first found a description of Pavlov's last work in a popular paperback,\nwritten by some Rockefeller-financed psychiatrist, when I was trying to\nfigure out (1) how cults worked their horrible mischief and (2) what should\nthe law say about what parents could do to \"deprogram\" children who had \nbecome brainwashed zombies. Naturally, main \nstream law objected to the zombies being physically \ncaptured by their parents and next subjected to stress that would help to\ndeprogram the effects of the stress they had endured in cult conversions. \n \nI never wanted to get into the legal controversy that existed about this\nsubject. But I did conclude that the controversy couldn't be handled with\nmaximized rationality without considering whether, \nas Pavlov's last work suggests, the heavy-handed imposition of stress might\nbe the only reversal method that would work to remedy one of the worst\nevils imaginable: a stolen mind. I have included this discussion of Pavlov\n(1) partly out of general antagonism toward taboos, (2) partly to make my\ntalk reasonably complete as it considers stress and (3) partly because I hope\nsome listener may \ncontinue my inquiry with more success. \n \nEighteen: Availability- Mis Weighing Tendency"

And the\nbrain can't use what it can't remember or what it is blocked from\nrecognizing because it is heavily influenced by one or more \npsychological tendencies bearing strongly on it, as the fellow is influenced\nby the nearby girl in the \nsong. And so the mind overweighs what is easily \navailable and thus displays Availability- Mis Weighing \nTendency. \n \nThe main antidote to miscues from Availability \nMisweighing Tendency often involve procedures, including use of\nchecklists, which are almost always helpful. \n \nAnother antidote is to behave somewhat like Darwin did when he\nemphasized disconfirming \nevidence. What should be done is to especially \nemphasize factors that don't produce reams of easily \navailable numbers, instead of drifting mostly or entirely into considering\nfactors that do produce \nsuch numbers. Still another antidote is to find and \nhire some skeptical, articulate people with far \nreaching minds to act as advocates for notions that \nare opposite to the incumbent notions.\n\f\nOne consequence of this tendency is that extra vivid evidence, being so\nmemorable and thus more \navailable in cognition, should often consciously be \nunderweighted while less vivid evidence should be \noverweighed. \n \nStill, the special strength of extra-vivid images \nin influencing the mind can be constructively used (1) in persuading\nsomeone else to reach a \ncorrect conclusion or (2) as a device for improving \none's own memory by attaching vivid images, one \nafter the other, to many items one doesn't want to forget. Indeed, such use of\nvivid images as \nmemory boosters is what enabled the great orators \nof classical Greece and Rome to give such long, \norganized speeches without using notes. \n \nThe great algorithm to remember in dealing with \nthis tendency is simple: An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because\nit is easily available to you. \n \nNineteen: Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency \n \nAll skills attenuate with disuse. I was a whiz \nat calculus until age twenty, after which the skill was soon obliterated by\ntotal nonuse. The right antidote to such a loss is to make use of the\n\f\nfunctional equivalent of the aircraft simulator employed in pilot training.\nThis allows a pilot to continuously practice all of the rarely used skills that\nhe can't afford to lose. \n \nThroughout his life, a wise man engages in \npractice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many \nof them outside his discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he\nreduces the number of skills \nhe practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will naturally\ndrift into error from man with a hammer tendency. His learning capacity\nwill also shrink as he creates gaps in the latticework of \ntheory he needs as a framework for understanding new experience. It is also\nessential for a thinking \nman to assemble his skills into a checklist that he \nroutinely uses. Any other mode of operation will \ncause him to miss much that is important. \n \nSkills of a very high order can be maintained \nonly with daily practice. The pianist Paderewski \nonce said that if he failed to practice for a single day, \nhe could notice his performance deterioration and \nthat, after a week's gap in practice, the audience \ncould notice it as well. \n \nThe hard rule of Lose-It-or-Lose-It Tendency tempers its harshness for the\ndiligent.

Practically no one is\ngood at learning complex \nnew skills when very old. But some people remain \npretty good in maintaining intensely practiced old \nskills until late in life. as one can notice in many a\n\f\nbridge tournament. \n \nOld people like me get pretty skilled, without \nworking at it, at disguising age-related deterioraion because social\nconvention, like clothing, hides \nmuch decline. \n \nContinuous thinking and learning, done with joy can somewhat help delay\nwhat is inevitable. \n \nTwenty-TWo: Authority-Misinfluence Tendency \n \nLiving in dominance hierarchies as he does, like \nall his ancestors before him, man was born mostly \nto follow leaders, with only a few people doing \nthe leading. And so, human society is formally \norganized into dominance hierarchies, with their \nculture augmenting the natural follow-the-leader \ntendency of man. \n \nBut automatic as most human reactions are, with \nthe tendency to follow leaders being no exception, \nman is often destined to suffer greatly when the \nleader is wrong or when his leader's ideas don't get \nthrough properly in the bustle of life and are misunderstood. And so, we\nfind much miscognition from\n\f\nman's Authority-Mis Influence Tendency. \n \nSome of the mis influences are amusing, as in \na case described by Cialdini. A physician left a written order for a nurse\ntreating an earache, as follows: \"Tho drops, twice a day, rear.\"' The \nnurse then directed the patient to turn over and put \nthe eardrops in his anus. \n \nOther versions of confused instructions from authority figures are tragic. In\nWorld War II, a new pilot for a general, who sat beside him in the \ncopilot's seat, was so anxious to please his boss \nthat he misinterpreted some minor shift in the \ngeneral's position as a direction to do some foolish thing. The pilot crashed\nthe plane and became a \nparaplegic. \n \nWell, naturally, cases like this one get the \nattention of careful thinkers like Boss Buffett, who \nalways acts like an over quiet mouse around his \npilots. \n \nSuch cases are also given attention in the \nsimulator training of copilots who have to learn to \nignore certain really foolish orders from boss pilots because boss pilots will\nsometimes err disastrously. \nEven after going through such a training regime,"

In this \nexperiment, a man posing as an authority figure, \nnamely a professor governing a respectable experiment, was able to trick a\ngreat many ordinary people \ninto giving what they had every reason to believe \nwere massive electric shocks that inflicted heavy \ntorture on innocent fellow citizens. This experiment did demonstrate a\nterrible result contributed \nto by Authority-Misinfluence Tendency, but it also \ndemonstrated extreme ignorance in the psychology professoriate right after\nWorld War II. \n \nAlmost any intelligent person with my checklist \nof psychological tendencies in his hand would, by\n\f\nsimply going down the checklist, have seen that Milgram's experiment\ninvolved about six powerful \npsychological tendencies acting in confluence to \nbring about his extreme experimental result. For \ninstance, the person pushing Milgram' s shock \nlever was given much social proof from presence \nof inactive bystanders whose silence communicated that his behavior was\nokay. Yet it took over \na thousand psychological papers, published before \nI got to Milgram, for the professoriate to get his experiment only about\nninety percent as well \nunderstood as it would have immediately been by any intelligent person\nwho used (1) any sensible \norganization of psychology along the lines of this talk, plus (2) a checklist\nprocedure. This outcome \ndisplaying the dysfunctional thinking of long-dead professors deserves a\nbetter explanation. I will later \ndeal with the subject in a very hesitant fashion. \n \nWe can be pleased that the psychology professoriate of a former era wasn't\nquite as dysfunctional as the angler in my next-to-last illustration of \nAuthority-Mis influence Tendency. \n \nWhen I once fished in the Rio Colorado in Costa Rica, my guide, in a state\nof shock, told me a \nstory about an angler who'd earlier come to the river\n\f\nwithout ever having fished for tarpon. A fishing guide like the one I had\nruns the boat and gives fishing advice, establishing himself in this context\nas the ultimate authority figure. In the case of \nthis guide, his native language was Spanish, while the angler's native\nlanguage was English. The angler got a big tarpon on and began submitting\nto \nmany directions from this authority figure called a guide: tip up, tip down,\nreel in, etc. Finally, when it was necessary to put more pressure on the fish \nby causing more bending of the angler's rod, the \nguide said in English: \"Give him the rod, give him the rod.\" Well, the angler\nthrew his expensive rod at the fish, and when last seen, it was going down\nthe Rio Colorado toward the ocean. This example \nshows how powerful is the tendency to go along \nwith an authority figure and how it can turn one's \nbrain into mush. \n \nMy final example comes from business. A \npsychology Ph. D. once became a CEO of a major \ncompany and went wild, creating an expensive new \nheadquarters, with a great wine cellar, at an isolated \nsite. At some point, his underlings remonstrated that money was running\nshort. \"Take the money \nout of the depreciation reserves,\" said the CEO. \nNot too easy because a depreciation reserve is a \nliability account."

Some people\nproduce copious amounts \nof twaddle and others very little. \n \nA trouble from the honeybee version of twaddle \nwas once demonstrated in an interesting experiment. A honeybee normally\ngoes out and finds \nnectar and then comes back and does a dance that \ncommunicates to the other bees where the nectar is. The other bees then go\nout and get it. Well some scientist-clever, like B. F, Skinner-decided to see\nhow well a honeybee would do with a handicap. He put the nectar straight\nup. Way up. Well, in a \nnatural setting, there is no nectar a long way straight\n\f\nup, and the poor honeybee doesn't have a generic \nprogram that is adequate to handle what she now \nhas to communicate. You might guess that this \nhoneybee would come back to the hive and slink into a corner, but she\ndoesn't. She comes into the hive and does an incoherent dance. Well, all my\nlife I've been dealing with the human equivalent of that honeybee. And it's a\nvery important part of wise administration to keep prattling people, pouring\nour twaddle, far away from the serious work. A rightly \nfamous Caltech engineering professor, exhibiting \nmore insight than tact, once expressed his version of this idea as follows:\n\"The principal job of an \nacademic administration is to keep the people who don't matter from\ninterfering with the work of the people that do.\" I include this quotation\npartly because I long suffered from backlash caused \nby my version of this professor's conversational manner. After much effort,\nI was able to improve \nonly slightly, so one of my reasons for supplying the quotation is my hope\nthat, at least in comparison, I will appear tactful. \n \nTwenty-Four: Reason-RespEcting Tendency \n \nThere is in man, particularly one in an advanced \nculture, a natural love of accurate cognition and a joy in its exercise. This\naccounts for the widespread popularity of crossword puzzles, other\npuzzles, \nand bridge and chess columns, as well as all games\n\f\nrequiring mental skill. \n \nThis tendency has an obvious implication. It \nmakes man especially prone to learn well when a \nwould-be teacher gives correct reasons for what \nis taught, instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no\nreasons given. Few \npractices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking \nthrough reasons before giving orders but also \ncommunicating these reasons to the recipient of the \norder. \n \nNo one knew this better than Carl Braun, who designed oil refineries with\nspectacular skill and integrity. He had a very simple rule, one of many \nin his large, Teutonic company: You had to tell Who was to do What,\nWhere, When, and Why. And if \nyou wrote a communication leaving out your explanation of why the\naddressee was to do what was \nordered, Braun was likely to fire you because Braun \nwell knew that ideas got through best when reasons \nfor the ideas were meticulously laid out. \n \nIn general, learning is most easily assimilated \nand used when, life long, people consistently hang \ntheir experience, actual and vicarious, on a lattice \nwork of theory answering the question: Why?\n\f\nIndeed, the question \"Why?\" is a sort of Rosetta \nstone opening up the major potentiality of mental \nlife. \n \nUnfortunately, Reason- Respecting Tendency \nis so strong that even a person's giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons\nwill increase compliance with his orders and requests. This has been \ndemonstrated in psychology experiments wherein \"compliance\npractitioners\" successfully jump co \nthe head of the lines in front of copying machines by explaining their\nreason: \"I have to make some \ncopies.\" This sort of unfortunate byproduct of \nReason-Respecting Tendency is a conditioned \nreflex, based on a widespread appreciation of the \nimportance of reasons. And, naturally, the practice \nof laying out various claptrap reasons is much used \nby commercial and cult \"compliance practitioners\" \nto help them get what they don't deserve. \n \nTwenty-Five: Lollapalooza Tendency-The Tendency to Get Extreme\nConsequences from Confluences of \nPsychological Tendencies Acting in Favor of a Particular Outcome \n \nThis tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once examined, at\nleast in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life. It accounts for the \nextreme result in the Milgram experiment and the\n\f\nextreme success of some cults that have stumbled \nthrough practice evolution into bringing pressure \nfrom many psychological tendencies to bear at the same time on conversion\ntargets. The targets \nvary in susceptibility, like the dogs Pavlov worked \nwith in his old age, but some of the minds that are \ntargeted simply snap into zombiedom under cult \npressure. Indeed, that is one cult's name for the \nconversion phenomenon: snapping. \n \nWhat are we to make of the extreme ignorance \nof the psychology textbook writers of yesteryear? \nHow could anyone who had taken a freshman \ncourse in physics or chemistry not be driven to \nconsider, above all, how psychological tendencies \ncombine and with what effects? Why would anyone \nthink his study of psychology was adequate without \nhis having endured the complexity involved in \ndealing with intertwined psychological tendencies? \nWhat could be more ironic than professors using \noversimplified notions while studying bad cognitive effects grounded in the\nmind's tendency to use \noversimplified algorithms? \n \nI will make a few tentative suggestions. Maybe \nmany of the long-dead professors wanted to create"

If so, these early \npsychology professors made a massive error in so restricting their approach\nto their subject. It would be like physics ignoring (1) astrophysics because it\ncouldn't happen in a physics lab, plus (2) all \ncompound effects. What psychological tendencies could account for early\npsychology professors \nadopting an over-restricted approach to their own \nsubject matter? One candidate would be Avail \nability-Mis Weighing Tendency grounded in a \npreference for easy-to-control data. And then the \nrestrictions would eventually create an extreme \ncase of man with a hammer tendency. Another \ncandidate might be envy/jealousy Tendency \nthrough which early psychology professors \ndisplayed some weird form of envy of a physics \nthat was misunderstood. And this possibility tends \nto demonstrate that leaving envy/jealousy out of \nacademic psychology was never a good idea. \n \nI now quitclaim all these historical mysteries to \nmy betters. \n \nWell, that ends my brief description of psycho \nlogical tendencies.\n\f\nQuestions and Answers: \n \nNow, as promised, I will ask and answer a few \ngeneral questions. \n \nMy first is a compound question: Isn't this list \nof psychological tendencies tautological to some \nextent compared to the system of Euclid?

The answers are yes, yes, \nand yes, but this matters only moderately. Further \nrefinement of these tendencies, while desirable, has \na limited practical potential because a significant \namount of messiness is unfixable in a soft science \nlike psychology. \n \nMy second question is: Can you supply a real \nworld model, instead of a Milgram-type controlled \npsychology experiment, that uses your system \nto illustrate multiple psychological tendencies \ninteracting in a plausibly diagnosable way?

    "raw_text": "requires that it pass an evacuation test, during \nwhich a full load of passengers must get our in some \nshort period of time. The government directs that \nthe test be realistic. So you can't pass by evacuating only twenty-year-old\nathletes. So McDonnell \nDouglas scheduled such a test in a darkened hangar using a lot of old\npeople as evacuees. The \npassenger cabin was, say, twenty feet above the \nconcrete floor of the hangar and was to be evacuated through moderately\nflimsy rubber chutes. The first \ntest was made in the morning. There were about \ntwenty very serious injuries, and the evacuation took so long it flunked the\ntime test. So what did McDonnell Douglas next do? It repeated the test \nin the afternoon, and this time there was another \nfailure, with about twenty more serious injuries, \nincluding one case of permanent paralysis. \n \nWhat psychological tendencies contributed to \nthis terrible result? Well, using my tendency list as a checklist, I come up\nwith the following explanation. Reward-Super Response Tendency drove\nMcDonnell Douglas to act fast. It couldn't sell its airliner until it passed the\ntest. Also pushing \nthe company was Doubt-Avoidance Tendency \nwith its natural drive to arrive at a decision and run with it. Then the\ngovernment's direction that the test be realistic drove Authority-Mis\nInfluence\n\f\nTendency into the mischief of causing McDonnell \nDouglas to overreact by using what was obviously \ntoo dangerous a test method. By now the course \nof action had been decided, so Inconsistency \nAvoidance Tendency helped preserve the near \nidiotic plan. When all the old people got to the \ndark hangar, with its high airline cabin and concrete \nfloor, the situation must have made McDonnell \nDouglas employees very queasy, but they saw other \nemployees and supervisors not objecting. Social \nProof Tendency, therefore, swamped the queasiness. And this allowed\ncontinued action as planned, \na continuation that was aided by more Authority \nMisinfluence Tendency. Then came the disaster \nof the morning test with its failure, plus serious \ninjuries. McDonnell Douglas ignored the strong \ndisconfirming evidence from the failure of the first \ntest because confirmation bias, aided by the triggering of strong Deprival-\nSuper Reaction Tendency, \nfavored maintaining the original plan. McDonnell \nDouglas' Deprival-Super Reaction Tendency was \nnow like that which causes a gambler, bent on \ngetting even after a huge loss, to make his final \nbig bet. After all, McDonnell Douglas was going to lose a lot if it didn't\npass its test as scheduled. \nMore psychology-based explanation can probably"

    "raw_text": "be made, but the foregoing discussion is complete enough to demonstrate\nthe utility of my system \nwhen used in a checklist mode. \n \nMy third question is also compound: In the \npractical world, what good is the thought system \nlaid out in this list of tendencies? Isn't practical \nbenefit prevented because these psychological tendencies are so thoroUghly\nprogrammed into the \nhuman mind by broad evolution [the combination of genetic and cultural\nevolution] that we can't get \nrid of them? Well, the answer is that the tendencies \nare probably much more good than bad. Otherwise, \nthey wouldn't be there, working pretty well for \nman, given his condition and his limited brain \ncapacity. So the tendencies can't be simply washed \nout automatically, and shouldn't be. Nevertheless, the psychological thought\nsystem described, \nwhen properly understood and used, enables the \nspread of wisdom and good conduct and facilitates \nthe avoidance of disaster. Tendency is not always \ndestiny, and knowing the tendencies and their \nantidotes can often help prevent trouble that would \notherwise occur. Here is a short list of examples reminding us of the great\nutility of elementary \npsychological knowledge:\n\f\nOne: Carl Braun's communication practices. \n \nTwo: The use of simulators in pilot training. \n \nThree: The system of Alcoholics Anonymous. \n \nFour: Clinical training methods in medical schools. \n \nFive: The rules of the U.S. Constitutional Convention: totally secret\nmeetings, no recorded \nvote by name until the final vote, votes reversible at any time before the end\nof the convention, then just \none vote on the whole Constitution. These are very clever psychology-\nrespecting rules. If the founders had used a different procedure, many\npeople would \nhave been pushed by various psychological tendencies into inconsistent,\nhardened positions. The \nelite founders got our Constitution through by a \nwhisker only because they were psychologically \nacute. \n \nSix: The use of Granny's incentive-driven rule to manipulate oneself toward\nbetter performance of one's duties. \n \nSeven: The Harvard Business School's\n\f\nemphasis on decision trees. When I was young and foolish I used to laugh\nat the Harvard Business School. I said, \"They're teaching twenty-eight year-\nold people that high school algebra works in real life\" But later, I wised up\nand realized that it was very important that they do that to counter \nsome bad effects from psychological tendencies. \nBetter late than never. \n \nEight: The use of autopsy equivalents at Johnson & Johnson. At most\ncorporations, if you make an acquisition and it turns out to be a \ndisaster, all the people, paperwork, and presentations that caused the foolish\nacquisition are quickly \nforgotten. Nobody wants to be associated with the poor outcome by\nmentioning it. But at Johnson & Johnson, the rules make everybody revisit\nold acquisitions, comparing predictions with outcomes. That is a very smart\nthing to do. \n \nNine: The great example of Charles Darwin as \nhe avoided confirmation bias, which has morphed into the extreme anti-\nconfirmation-bias method of the \"double blind\" studies wisely required in\ndrug \nresearch by the FDA \n \nTen: The Warren Buffett rule for open-outcry \nauctions: Don't go. \n \nMy fourth question is; What special knowledge\n\f\nproblems lie buried in the thought system demon \nstarted by your list? \n \nWell, one answer is paradox. In social \npsychology, the more people learn about the system \nthe less it is true, and this is what gives the system \nits great value as a preventer of bad outcomes and a \ndriver of good outcomes. This result is paradoxical, and doesn't remind one\nof elementary physics, but \nso what. One can't get all the paradox out of pure \nmath, so why should psychology be shocked by \nsome paradox? \n \nThere is also some paradox in cognition change \nthat works even when the manipulated person knows he is being\nmanipulated. This creates a sort of paradox in a paradox, but, again, so\nwhat. I once much enjoyed an occasion of this sort. I drew this \nbeautiful woman as my dinner partner many years ago. I'd never seen her\nbefore. She was married \nto a prominent Los Angeles man. She sat down \nnext to me, turned her beautiful face up, and said, \n\"Charlie, what one word accounts for your remarkable success in life?\" I\nknew I was being manipulated by a practiced routine, and I just loved it. I\nnever see this woman without a little lift in my spirits. And, by the way, I\ntold her I was rational. You'll have to judge yourself whether that's true. I\n\f\nmay be demonstrating some psychological tendency I hadn't planned on\ndemonstrating. \n \nMy fifth question is: Don't we need more reconciliation of psychology and\neconomics? My answer \nis yes, and I suspect that some slight progress is being made. I have heard of\none such example. Colin Camerer of Caltech, who works in \"experimental\neconomics,\" devised an interesting experiment in which he caused high I.Q.\nstudents, playing for real money, to pay price A+B for a \"security\" they\nknew would turn into A dollars at the end of \nthe day. This foolish action occurred because the \nstudents were allowed to trade with each other in a \nliquid market for the security. And some students \nthen paid price A+B because they hoped to unload \non other students at a higher price before the day was over. What I will now\nconfidently predict is \nthat, despite Camerer's experimental outcome, \nmost economics and corporate finance professors \nwho still believe in the \"hard-form efficient market hypothesis\" will retain\ntheir original belief. If so, \nthis will be one more indication of how irrational \nsmart people can be when influenced by psycho \nlogical tendencies. \n \nMy sixth question is: Don't moral and prudential problems come with\nknowledge of these\n\f\npsychological tendencies? The answer is yes. \nFor instance, psychological knowledge improves persuasive power and, like\nother power, it can be used for good or ill. Captain Cook once played a \npsychology-based trick on his seamen to cause them to eat sauerkraut and\navoid scurvy. In my opinion. \nthis action was both ethical and wise under the \ncircumstances, despite the deliberate manipulation \ninvolved. But ordinarily, when you try to use your \nknowledge of psychological tendencies in the artful \nmanipulation of someone whose trust you need, you \nwill be making both a moral and prudential error. \n \nThe moral error is obvious. The prudential error \ncomes because many intelligent people, targeted for \nconscious manipulation, are likely to figure out what you are trying to do\nand resent your action. \n \nMy final question is: Aren't there factual and \nreasoning errors in this talk The answer is yes, almost surely yes. 'the final\nrevision was made from memory over about fifty hours by a man eighty-\none \nyears old, who never took a course in psychology \nand has read none of it, except one book on developmental psychology, for\nnearly fifteen years. Even so, I think the totality of my talk will stand up\nvery \nwell, and I hope all my descendants and friends will"

    "raw_text": "carefully consider what I have said. I even hope \nthat more psychology professors will join me in: \n(1) making heavy use of inversion; (2) driving for a \ncomplete description of the psychological system so \nthat it works better as a checklist; and (3) especially \nemphasizing effects from combinations of psychological tendencies. \n \nWell that ends my talk. If in considering what I \nhave said yo U had ten percent the fun I had saying \nIt you were lucky recipients. \n \nTalk Eleven Revisited \n \nIn this talk, made in 2000, I gave favorable mention to Judith Rich Harris\nstrong-selling book The Nurture Assumption. You will recall that this work \ndemonstrated that peer pressure on the young is far more important, and \nparental nurture is much less important, than had been commonly\nrecognized. The success of the book, with its vast practical implications,\nhas an interesting story behind it: Long before the book was published, Ms.\nHarris, now 67, was kicked out \nof Harvard's PhD. program in psychology because Harvard believed that\nshe lacked \nqualities ideal in psychological research. Then, later, out of illness and\nobscurit_v, as she was pretty much housebound throughout adult life by\nunfixable autoimmune\n\f\ndisease, she published an academic paper on which her subsequent book\nwas based. \nAnd for that paper she won a prestigious medal, named after the man who\nsigned \nher dismissal notice from Harvard, awarded annually by the American\nPsychological \nAssociation for distinction in published writing. \n \nWhen I learned from her impressive book that this ironic result had\noccurred, I wrote to Harvard, my alma mater, urging it to award Ms. Harris,\nwhom I did not know, an honorary PhD., or, better yet, a real Ph. D. I cited\nthe example of Oxford. That great university once allowed its best student,\nSamuel Johnson, to leave without a degree because he was too poor to\ncontinue paying tuition. But Oxford later made gracious amends. It gave\nJohnson a doctorate after he conquered sickness and became famous in a\ntough climb once described in his own words: \"Slow rises worth, by\npoverty oppressed.\" I failed utterly in my effort to convince Harvard to\nimitate Oxford in this way. But Harvard did later recruit from MIT one of\nthe most famous living psychology professors, Steven Pinker, and Pinker is\na big admirer of Ms. Harris. From this step, we can see one reason why its\nliberal arts division is more highly regarded than most others. The division's\nextreme depth often allows partial correction of bonehead errors that would\nflourish unopposed elsewhere. \n \nJudith Rich Harris (b. 1938)\n\f\nJudith Rich Harris is an independent investigator and author. Her significant\nprofessional accomplishments include a mathematical model of visual\nspeech, textbooks in developmental psychology, and many influential\nprofessional articles. She is best known for The Nurture Assumption (1998)\nand No Two Alike (2000. Ms. Harris lives with her husband in New Jersey. \n \nIn 2006, MS Harris, struggling further through her unfixable illness,\nhas published another book, No two alike the title is apt because one\nCentral question the author assaults is why identical twins turn out to\nbe so different in important aspects of personality her dogged\ncuriosity and Raigad in dealing with this question remind me of board\nDarwin and Sherlock Holmes and her solution is very plausible as\nshe collects and explains data from Professional literature including\nan interesting case where in one of two identical twins became a\nsuccess in business and family life while the other twin went to\nSkidrow. \nI won't hear disclose MS Harris desirably generalised answer to her\nCentral question because it would be better for eliminate readers to\nfirst guess the answer then read her book if miss Harris is roughly\nright which seems very likely to me she'll has twice from a very\nhandicapped position produced academic and sides of great\npractical importance in child rearing, education and much else. \n \n how could this rare and desirable result happen? Well, by miss\nHarris own account, she was impertinent and skeptical even as a\nchild. And these qualities + patient, determined skill have obviously\nserved her truth seeking well, all the way through to age 67 no doubt\nshe was also assisted by her enthusiasm in destroying her own\nideas as she now demonstrate by apologizing for her former work as\na text book writer who repeated wrong notions now outgrown"
