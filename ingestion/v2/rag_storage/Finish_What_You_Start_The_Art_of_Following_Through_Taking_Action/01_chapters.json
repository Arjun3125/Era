    "raw_text": "Introduction\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat exactly is finishing what you start and following through? You have\nmay heard these phrases before, but what do they mean?\n \nTo me, they mean making your intentions reality. Too often, we’ll say we’ll\ndo something, and we might even start it one lucky weekend. But at the first\nsign of hardship, fatigue, boredom, or busyness, we abandon it all too easily\nand it sits in our garage (mental, figurative, or literal) for the rest of eternity.\n \nFinishing what you start and following through is breaking through that\ncommon loop and taking hold of your life.\n \nMy personal experience with finishing what I start has been checkered. One\nsummer, I promised myself that I would carve a wooden canoe, about 12\ninches long and 3 inches wide. Not too big, but a sufficient challenge for\nsomeone with no woodworking experience. The first week, I made a\nconsiderable dent in my wood block. The second week, my hands were sore\nand the new Star Wars movie was out. The third week, I was too busy\nseeing Star Wars again and procrastinating. My wooden canoe wasn’t\nmeant to be.\n \nBut every time I walked through my garage to my car, the canoe was a\ndamning reminder of my laziness and inability to follow through. It wore on\nme until I committed myself to finishing it a couple of summers later. You\n\f\ncan probably guess what happened. The first week went great, the second\nweek was moderate, and the third week I was already running on fumes.\n \nI was fortunate to learn about temptation bundling some time shortly\nthereafter, which provided the boost for me to finish my canoe. Briefly, as\ntemptation bundling will be a major theme later in the book, temptation\nbundling is when you combine an obligatory (and undesirable) task with an\ninstantaneous reward. When you can bribe yourself into working hard,\nsuddenly finishing what you start isn’t a massive exercise in willpower—\nit’s the pursuit of something pleasurable, if only by association.\n \nThe reward I bundled the canoe carving with was listening to my favorite\nalbums—something we rarely have time for these days. When’s the last\ntime you listened to your favorite album from beginning to end without\ninterruption?\n \nSuddenly, a new world was opened to me; if I could make any unpleasant\ntask just pleasant enough by pairing it with something I enjoyed, I could\nplow my way through just about anything. It was a small realization like\nthis that led me to study the science of following through and executing,\ndespite the human brain’s instinctual resistance to doing so. How can we\ncircumvent our worst instincts and get things done when we want, without\nthe specter of a deadline over our heads? How can we pay attention to our\nattention and do that what is most difficult—live with supreme discomfort?\n \nI’d like to think I’ve come up with great systems for myself that can be\nwidely applied for just about any context. There are many tactics in this\nbook—I don’t use all of them all of the time, but most of them will work for\nmost people. As usual, I wrote this book for myself and am glad and proud\nto be able to share my findings. I hope they are helpful and help you\naccomplish exactly what you want. At least, I hope they force you to listen\nto your favorite albums from time to time—a win in itself!\n\f\nChapter 1. Stop Thinking, Just Execute\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEsther has thought about it a million times. Stuck in a dead-end desk job for\nthe last six years, she has fantasized about not having to deal with the\nmonotony of paperwork, not having to report to a demanding boss, and not\nhaving to leave her two-year-old son at the daycare center every day.\n \nAnd exactly how were such fantasies supposed to be realized when she had\nto earn a living to make ends meet for her family? She had the answer: she\nfigured she’d start her own baking business right at home.\n \nIt was all just a fantasy, a thought she’d conjure to get her through difficult\ndays at work. But one day, something felt different. For some reason, she\nfinally decided—she’s going for it. After all, baking was her one true\npassion. For years, she’d been baking cakes and cookies for her friends,\nwho all said she should think of turning it into a business, so maybe it\nwasn’t such a bad idea, right?\n \nSo began Esther’s quest to open her baking business. She didn’t quit her job\njust yet but filed for a two-week vacation leave to start testing the waters.\nFirst, she thought, research. She figured that she needed to get this business\nthing all figured out in her head first, before she took any further step\nforward. The more prepared and planned she was, the better. She intended\nto research everything there is to know about starting such a venture, from\nrecipes to finance management. She also planned to survey her friends and"

    "raw_text": "the entire neighborhood to get a feel of the market needs. It was all starting\nto take shape in her head.\n \nUnfortunately, whatever took shape in Esther’s head stayed there and never\nfound its way out.\n \nThe thought of having to learn everything about how to start and run a\nbaking business from scratch overwhelmed Esther so much that she was\nparalyzed from taking any action in that direction. Taxes, business filings,\nleases? All she wanted to do was bake!\n \nWhen her vacation days started, she always found things to do other than\nwhat she had initially planned. She spent her days sleeping in, doting on her\nson, busying herself with “home projects,” and catching up with her friends\nand neighbors—and not even to ask them for marketing input. She was too\nworried that if she started telling people about wanting to start a business\nthey might think she was too ambitious for her level of talent, expect her to\nfail, or, worse, expect her to succeed. She couldn’t deal with the idea of\nexpectations hanging over her head.\n \nTwo weeks thus came and went, and all Esther managed to do was put the\n“vacation” in vacation leave. As she headed back to work, the thought of\nrunning her own baking business kept on replaying in her head, still more a\nfantasy than a plan. She had a feeling she’d continue to think about it,\nseveral million times more.\n \nWhat Is Following Through?\n \nWhat do you suppose went wrong in Esther’s situation? Did she lack focus?\nSelf-discipline? Action? Persistence?\n \nIf you say she lacked all of the above, you’re pointing to actually just one\nconcept: following through.\n \nFollowing through is related to focus, self-discipline, action, and\npersistence, but it is not synonymous to any of them. Rather, it is a\n\f\ncomposite of all of them—a bit like how those big Japanese anime robots\ncome to be formed by the fusion of smaller individual robot parts. Power\nRangers, or Voltron, to be specific. And much like how each smaller robot\nforms a different body part in the big robot, so too does each of these four\nelements—focus, self-discipline, action, and persistence—correspond to a\nbody part that, when pieced with the others, forms the whole of following\nthrough.\n \nThe head: focus. Following through involves having focus. It’s akin to the\nhead because it is focus that keeps your head in the game and your eyes on\nthe prize. Focus guides your thoughts in figuring out how to follow through\nand directs your actions toward achieving your vision. See, following\nthrough is not just about exerting effort; it’s about exerting effort that’s\nconcentrated on a single goal. With focus, no effort is wasted. What’s\nfollowed is a single line of sight, so what’s pursued is the single most direct\nway toward a goal.\n \nGoing back to Esther’s situation, had she been focused on her dream of\nstarting a business, she would’ve structured her free time better, scheduling\nactivities in view of realizing that dream.\n \nThe spine: self-discipline. The spine of following through, self-discipline,\nis what enables you to get your head down and work when you need to,\neven if you don’t want to. It’s the ability to control yourself so that you\nretain focus on what needs to be done, despite the temptations and\ndistractions you may encounter. This element is essential to following\nthrough because it’s what gives you the power to regulate your own\nthoughts, feelings, and actions toward ends that are meaningful to you.\nWithout self-discipline, you wouldn’t be able to consistently exert effort on\nsomething until it’s done, which is what following through is all about.\n \nAs the head is continuous with the spine, so is focus continuous with self-\ndiscipline. If you are focused on what you need to do, self-discipline will\nnaturally follow. Likewise, if you are self-disciplined, it will be easier for\nyou to focus on what needs to be done and avoid distractions. Self-\ndiscipline, like the spine, keeps you upright so you don’t slump into a mess.\n\f\nIf Esther had enough self-discipline, she would’ve been able to resist using\nall her free time just for leisure. There’s nothing wrong with catching up on\nsome sleep or spending time with your loved ones, but if all your days are\nspent doing just those and none of productive work, then balance is lost.\nLeisure is an important part of life, but if it’s excessive and takes the place\nof reasonable productivity, then it becomes a vice.\n \nThe hands and feet: action. Action, the hands and feet of following\nthrough, means prioritizing execution and simple motion. This is what\nmakes following through more than just having focus and self-discipline.\nFollowing through is an intention that’s been translated into action. It is\naction that will move things in the real world and take you from Point A to\nPoint B—that is, from where you are now to where the fulfillment of your\ngoals lies. It is the visible aspect of following through, the one that’s\nactually observed, measured, and evaluated against your goals. Action is\nthus crucial to the execution of your plans and the realization of your goals,\nfor without it, plans remain abstract and goals remain dreams.\n \nHad Esther acted on even just the first part of her plan, research, she\nwould’ve at least inched her way toward realizing the dream business she\nhad in mind.\n \nThe heart: persistence. Finally, at the heart of following through is\npersistence. Persistence is firmly sticking to something for a prolonged\nperiod of time, even as you encounter things that try to unstick you. It’s the\ntenacity to adhere to a course of action even in the face of obstacles. It is\nnot enough to just start; you need stick with it until it’s done. Following\nthrough is about having enough heart to keep pushing even in the face of\nobstacles, distractions, and setbacks. Many of the goals worth aiming for in\nlife call for not just a sprint but a marathon. If your heart is not fit enough to\nrun the length of it, then you will find yourself stopping halfway through\nand giving up before you reach the finish line.\n \nDid Esther have the persistence to see her dream through? It seems this\nquestion isn’t even available to ask in Esther’s case, as the question of\n\f\npersistence can only arise if one has in fact taken enough action to get to\nencounter several roadblocks over an extended period of time. Since Esther\nstopped before she even began, the question of persistence wasn’t even in\nthe equation for her.\n \nSo there you have it—the individual parts focus, self-discipline, action, and\npersistence all combine to be the super-robot called following through and\nfinishing what you start. It’s gratifying and fulfilling to be able to pull\ntogether focus, self-discipline, action, and persistence within ourselves and\nget to watch our dreams be turned into reality as a result of it.\n \nBut if following through is so awesome, why don’t we all just do it all the\ntime? The short answer is because it’s hard. The long answer (which also\nexplains why it’s hard) is detailed below.\n \nWhy Don’t We Follow Through?\n \nWhen it comes to thinking up what we want to do, what we need to do, or\nwhat other people need to do, we’re usually experts. Our ideas run wild, the\nblueprints in our heads get magically written out with not much effort, and\nthe mental picture of us living our dreams comes into sharp focus faster\nthan we can say “cheese!”\n \nBut when it comes to actually getting off our butts and following through\nwith action, we’re usually not only amateurs but also unwilling participants.\nWhen it comes down to it, we often couldn’t find the focus, self-discipline,\naction, and persistence needed to get the job done.\n \nSometimes we go into the battle without our heads or our spines; other\ntimes we lack our hands and feet or our hearts. We think we could just call\non these parts to get together when we need them to, but we arrive at the\nbattleground only to discover that it’s never as easy as we thought it would\nbe.\n \nThe excitement and enthusiasm with which we thought out all our dreams\nand plans fizzle out as soon as we realize the amount of hard work we need"

    "raw_text": "to put in to turn those dreams into reality, to bring those plans into life. We\ndon’t follow through, and it’s not for lack of ability or intelligence, no.\n \nWe don’t follow through for two main reasons: we have an entire selection\nof (1) inhibiting tactics and/or (2) psychological roadblocks that hinder us\nfrom finishing what we start. We’ll cover each of those in turn below.\n \nInhibiting Tactics\n \nInhibiting tactics refer to our schemes for misusing time and effort, with the\nend result of our being held back from following through. These are ways\nwe sabotage ourselves, sometimes consciously. These tactics, which include\n(1) setting bad goals, (2) procrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and\ndistractions, and (4) poor time management, inhibit us from maximizing the\ntime and energy we have toward productive ends.\n \nSetting bad goals. One way we handicap ourselves from following through\nis by setting bad goals, such as those that are too abstract or downright\nimpossible. Setting bad goals is like buying the wrong map for a road trip; it\nprevents us from following through because the directions are skewed and\nconfusing. It eventually causes us to lose patience and will to keep on in our\njourney, which we often end up abandoning halfway through.\n \nWhen our goals are too abstract, we find ourselves lost as to what needs to\nbe done in order to reach them. For example, if we say our goal is to be\nhealthier and yet don’t even specify what we mean by “healthier,” we’re\nless likely to take steps toward accomplishing it. We want to follow\nthrough, but we don’t know how.\n \nWhen our goals are too high or unrealistic for any mortal to reach, we find\nourselves looking up at an impossibly high ladder without rungs. The\nbeauty of this is that no one would be able to accuse us of not trying hard\nenough to climb, because there are no rungs in the first place. We are\nabsolved from the guilt of not following through. Take for instance a plant\nmanager aiming to double manufacturing output despite real logistical\nlimitations.\n\f\nSince the goal is impossible to achieve anyway, whether he follows through\nor not wouldn’t make a difference—and so he’s saved from both the trouble\nof having to follow through and the guilt from not doing so.\n \nProcrastination. This is one of the most widely used tactics in the book. We\nare somehow exceptionally talented at delaying work until we absolutely\nneed to do it, until the very last minute. In fact, we're so talented at delaying\nwork that we could convince others (and even ourselves) that we’re already\nworking even when we’re not.\n \nOne way we procrastinate is with endless planning. We plan all the details\nof our task, and once we’re done planning, we decide that either the plan\nneeds revising or the task itself needs to be scrapped. Then we plan for a\nnew task, and so on—all the while conveniently unaware of the fact that all\nthe planning we’re doing is also a form of procrastination. Ultimately, it’s\nsomething best referred to as productive procrastination because it feels\nlike you’re getting somewhere, but you’re really just moving in place.\n \nIf we can get away with putting off a task at the moment, we tend to do so\nbecause it’s easy, comfortable, and stress-free. This is how a lot of\nwould’ve-been success stories get to be just that—would’ve been. A\nlifetime string of “laters” ends up being woven into the noose of “never.”\n \nTemptations and distractions. The road of following through would be easy\nenough to tread, without delay, if it were like a hallway with blank walls on\neither side. If you didn’t have a choice, you might very well put your head\ndown and work, work, work. But no. This road is lined with all sorts of\nshiny trinkets, glittering detour signs, and inviting rest stops. Temptations\nand distractions come aplenty these days, with something as simple as a red\nnotification alert on our phone screens flooding our brains with feel-good\nchemicals that, in turn, keep us glued to our phones even longer.\n \nTake for example a marketing officer tasked to develop a campaign to\npromote a new product. She is well aware of the research she needs to do,\nthe reports she needs to write, the presentations she needs to start prepping.\n\f\nBut instead of following through and retaining focus so she gets things done\nfaster, her hours are riddled by Snapchat conversations, YouTube binges,\nand endless Instagram scrolls. Eventually, the research may get done, the\nreports may get written, and the presentations may be prepped, but such are\nnot likely to reflect her true potential.\n \nBut of course, we cannot rid the world of temptations and distractions.\nAfter all, they’re not the main problem. The main problem is that we lack\nthe know-how to properly deal with them. While they may come aplenty on\neither side of the road, there are two ways we can still manage the situation\nthrough (1) strategic avoidance and (2) healthy, moderate use.\n \nFirst, we may implement strategies to avoid temptations and distractions.\nFor example, if we’re distracted by frequent notifications from social\nmedia, we may schedule blocks of time during which we’re logged out\nfrom our social media accounts while we focus on our work.\n \nSecond, we may deal with temptations and distractions in a healthy and\nproductive way. We don’t need to deprive ourselves of tempting and\nenjoyable leisure activities for the rest of our lives just so we could follow\nthrough on our goals. In fact, we’re not supposed to.\n \nGiving ourselves a well-deserved break by indulging in activities we find\nenjoyable would help recharge us so we could function better. The key is in\nhaving the discipline enough to indulge on those activities in a healthy way.\nFor instance, we may periodically reward ourselves with a 10-minute break,\nduring which we log back in and check on our social media accounts, after\nwe accomplish a set amount of work.\n \nPoor time management. “So much to do, and not enough time to do it.”\nHow many times have you heard these words spoken by a colleague, a\nfamily member, or the person looking back at you in the mirror? And how\nmany times could you see that it’s not time they lacked, but the ability to\nuse their time productively? We all have the same amount of time in the\nday."

    "raw_text": "Time management is the practice of using time in a way that maximizes\nproductivity and efficiency. Good time management involves not only the\nability to schedule tasks, but also the insight and good judgment to\nrecognize which tasks are best done when. Moreover, it requires having the\nself-discipline to do tasks as initially planned and the focus to organize\nresources accordingly. With good time management, a schedule is cleverly\norganized and then promptly followed, so tasks get done as planned.\n \nOn the other hand, bad time management involves a lack of planning,\norganization, focus, and self-discipline. We forget, overlook, or\nmiscalculate tasks in terms of how much time they’d require for\ncompletion, leading to a domino effect that messes up the rest of our plans.\nWe fail to foresee and provide for the resources we need for the activities\nwe’ve planned, leading to delays and cancellations. We fail to prioritize our\nactivities, instead choosing to spend our time doing nonessential tasks,\nleading to unsuccessful endeavors (plus maybe a scolding glare from our\nboss).\n \nLife in the 21st century is challenging our ability to maintain work-life\nbalance like no other time before. With technology allowing more work\nhours as well as more entertainment options than ever, we no longer seem\nto find 24 hours enough to fit in everything we need and want to do in a\nday. With such demands and lifestyles, poor time management has become\nthe norm, and good time management is a superpower only the enlightened\nhave seemed to master.\n \nAnd if we can’t even manage our time when it comes to our day-to-day\ntasks, how could we expect to find time to follow through on our bigger life\nplans?\n \nPsychological Roadblocks\n \nPsychological roadblocks refer to the internal, often unconscious\nmechanisms in our psyches that act as barriers to following through.\nAmong these mechanisms are (1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of\njudgment, rejection, and failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4)\n\f\nlack of self-awareness. These psychological roadblocks operate internally to\ninhibit external action, thus preventing us from following through.\n \nLaziness and lack of discipline. The reason we don’t follow through can\nsometimes be as simple as being too lazy and lacking the discipline to do\nso. Our laziness hinders us from getting off the couch and working on the\nimportant tasks that will get us closer to our goals. Our lack of discipline\nsees us squandering our time to distractions and temptations. We may get\nour calendars planned out, our to-do lists ready, and everything else we\nneed prepared, but somehow we lack the willpower and discipline within us\nto just start, just do, and just keep pushing. We see the sacrifice, however\nsmall, we would have to make, and we decide that it’s not worth it.\n \nWillpower is the energy that activates our bodies, while discipline is the\nfocus that directs that energy so that we’re constantly moving toward our\ngoals. If we don’t find a way to turn our willpower and discipline on, our\nbodies would simply continue to be in their inactive state, never following\nthrough.\n \nFear of judgment, rejection, and failure. Imagine Lara, a volunteer for a\nlocal organization helping provide education for less fortunate children. She\nhas an idea for a fundraising campaign that will bring in more sponsors. She\nplans what she needs to do and researches who she needs to talk to in order\nto make things happen.\n \nBut before she even makes the first call to get the ball rolling, her breath\ncatches. She hesitates and thinks, What if I organize this campaign but\nnobody signs up for it? What if our community leaders back my idea but it\nwinds up being a flop? What if we’d end up spending more money than we\nactually gain? So she drops the idea entirely and immediately starts\nbreathing easier.\n \nWhat stopped Lara from following through was her fear of judgment,\nrejection, and failure. To her, not following through was an act of self-\npreservation, a way to save herself from the pain of failure. Since she never\n\f\nasked for anything, she never got rejected. Since she never went after a\ngoal, no one could say she failed at it.\n \nFear of judgment, rejection, and failure thus paralyzes us from following\nthrough. We think that by abstaining from action, we cancel out the\npossibility of producing any output that might be subject to evaluation or\njudgment. And if we can’t be evaluated or judged, we also can’t be rejected.\nIf we don’t try to go for things, especially things that challenge us, then we\ncan’t fail. However, these are ruinous distortions in reasoning. By not acting\nand not following through, we have already judged and rejected ourselves\neven before we’ve started. We have already failed the moment we decided\nnot to try.\n \nPerfectionism out of insecurity. Paul has been planning to apply for\npromotion for several years now. He has been putting in the effort to\nupgrade his professional knowledge and skills, attending seminars, taking\ncertification exams, and enrolling in post-graduate classes. He wants his\nrésumé to be perfect so that when he does apply for promotion, he can be\nsure he’ll get it. For Paul, it was either perfection or nothing.\n \nSeveral more years passed, and he’s still never applied for a higher position.\nHis credentials didn’t feel good enough to him, and it never did. His\nperfectionism, born out of his fear and insecurity that he wasn’t good\nenough, was what prevented Paul from following through. Instead of taking\naction that will move him forward, he focused his energy on overplanning\nand striving for perfection, ultimately leading to stagnation. To the outside\nworld, it may have seemed that Paul was a busy bee working toward his\ngoals, but in reality he was internally inhibited by his perfectionism from\ntruly following through.\n \nLack of self-awareness. Finally, lack of self-awareness could also be a\npsychological barrier against following through. Because we’re so often\nafraid of making mistakes and venturing past our comfort zones, we never\nget to learn the fullest extent of what we can do. Thus, many of our\ninterests, passions, and talents remain hidden to us forever. And not\nknowing our true capacities, we remain convinced that we will never make"

    "raw_text": "it, even if we tried. So we don’t follow through on our plans and, in so\ndoing, trap ourselves in a lifetime of stagnation.\n \nWhat’s more, we don’t even realize we’ve fallen into the trap of stagnation\nbecause we also lack the self-awareness that we’re not following through.\nWe continue living our busy lives, content with the idea that we can’t\npossibly be working harder than we already are. But if we strip our lives\nwith the little bits and bobs we busy ourselves with and take a long hard\nlook at the big picture, we then realize that we’ve been avoiding following\nthrough on things that really matter.\n \nSo there you have it—the list of reasons why we don’t follow through. We\nstart with excitement and enthusiasm but end up with excuses and\nexplanations. We start with anticipation but end up with alibis. And all too\noften, we don’t bother looking past what’s in front of us because what’s in\nfront of us is easy and convenient. A part of us doesn’t want to know what’s\npossible beyond that because we’re afraid to want it and to have to do the\nhard work that will get us there.\n \nBut take courage for a moment, and for the sake of your personal growth\nand happiness, consider how your life would be different if you made\nfollowing through a habit.\n \nWhat if We Do Follow Through?\n \nFollowing through is the more difficult path, but the benefits it can yield\nmake the journey worth the struggle. If you develop the habit of following\nthrough, you’ll be able to increase your productivity, maximize every\nopportunity, and realize your fullest potentials. Your academic and career\ngoals will be real guideposts in your life instead of just being pipe dreams\nand ending up as frustrations.\n \nBeing a person who follows through will also improve your relationships.\nYou’ll find that as you consistently keep your promises, you’ll gain and\nretain the trust of your supervisors, your colleagues, and your staff. More\nimportantly, you’ll be building better relationships with your spouse, your\n\f\nchildren, and your friends. They know they can trust your word because\nthey’ve seen you act on your plans and deliver on your promises.\n \nWhat’s more, following through will help you build a better relationship\nwith yourself. Following through forces you to be in touch with your own\nwants, needs, capacities, and fears more intimately, so you get to take\ncharge of your own life instead of being just a slave to your unconscious\nfears and society’s pressures on you.\n \nIn summary, following through is the powerful combination of focus, self-\ndiscipline, action, and persistence. It’s the force that drives you toward\nhigher professional achievements, better relationships, and greater personal\nsatisfaction.\n \nHowever, both tactics-based and psychologically-based roadblocks can\noften hinder you from consistently following through on your dreams and\ngoals. You may have the passion and motivation to do something at first,\nbut the fire within you is likely to die down somewhere along the way. To\nreignite it, you must first understand what’s holding you back, then equip\nyourself with the right tactics and psychological tools to help you follow\nthrough on the things you start.\n \nRecall the story of Esther told at the beginning of this chapter. She took a\nleave in the hopes of getting to start on her own business, but she failed to\nfollow through because she was tempted to indulge in pleasurable\ndistractions and was taken by her fear of rejection and failure. Instead of\nusing the time she had to set realistic goals and follow through on building\nthe life of her dreams, she ended up returning to a life she didn’t enjoy\nliving.\n \nImagine if Esther was aware of the barriers that were keeping her from\nfollowing through. Suppose she responded by using the right tactics and\npsychological tools to counter such barriers and eventually succeeded in\nrunning a home-based bakery business. Every day, she’d be waking up\nexcited to get to work with something she’s passionate about. She’d get to"

Are you following\nthrough on what you really want in your life? Or are you constantly falling\nvictim to the tactics and psychological barriers that hinder you from doing\nso?\n \nIf you answered the latter, then read on. The following pages will equip you\nwith the tools you need and show you the way toward developing in\nyourself the all-important power of following through.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nThe art of following through is something that allows you to create\nthe life that you actually want instead of settling for the life you\ncurrently have.\nIt can be said to be composed of four parts: focus, self-discipline,\naction, and persistence—all equally important.\nHowever, it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus\ndoing it. There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start\nand follow through very often. These reasons can generally be split\ninto two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks.\nInhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without\neven realizing it. They include (1) setting bad goals, (2)\nprocrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and\n(4) poor time management.\nPsychological roadblocks are the ways we don’t follow through\nbecause we are unconsciously protecting ourselves. These include\n(1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of judgment, rejection,\nand failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4) lack of self-\nawareness."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 2: Staying Hungry\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat drives you to follow through and finish what you start? How can you\nremain motivated?\n \nLet’s consider a woman named Sally. Sally is an idealist so she started a\ncharity to benefit impoverished people. What she did not anticipate was the\ninflux of challenges that came along with her endeavor. She did not realize\nthat working in a nonprofit setting still counts as business and that her work\nwould involve far more business than just helping people.\n \nWhenever she encountered a challenge in procuring funding, competing\nwith other charities for donations and grants, and creating marketing to\nincite interest in her cause, she felt overwhelmed. “Why is it so hard to get\npeople to care about other people!?” she asked herself.\n \nPretty soon, Sally became completely disinterested in her work—it just\ncarried with it too many negative feelings and associations. She hated\nwriting grant letters and attending charity events. It took only a few months\nfor her to give up on a cause that she cared deeply about. Other people\nwondered why she stopped working for something that meant so much to\nher.\n \nA key to Sally’s failure was her inability to anticipate and plan for negative\naspects of her foundation. She imagined doing more to help people and\nworking less to procure funding. Because she relied solely on her goals to\n\f\ngive her the motivation to follow through, she did not give herself anything\nto actually help her defeat the negative aspects of the business side of her\nfoundation.\nThe true problem that Sally had, however, was failing to find a true source\nof motivation. She needed to have found a true source of motivation to help\ncarry through the discouraging effects of the negatives. By creating a\nbalance between her dream, the positives, and the negatives, the negatives\nwould have been acceptable obstacles in pursuit of her grand goal. She\ncould have also kept her motivation alive by reminding herself of why she\nundertook this project in the first place and how each thing she did, even the\ntasks she hated, led to the fulfillment of her idealistic dream.\n \nSally is a great example of how you can’t just count on your passion for\nsomething to lead you to follow through.\n \nSometimes we just don’t care about what we are doing, and thus we don’t\nfollow through. We lose steam because of disinterest. That’s\nunderstandable. But even caring about something is not always the key to\nfollowing through. Sometimes, even for things we care about, we still can’t\nfollow through because we lack a drive to push us forward.\n \nThis lack of drive is caused by a massive disconnect between three\nimportant aspects: (1) what the things we care about represent, (2) the\npositive benefits we receive from our actions, and (3) the negative\nconsequences we can avoid related to our causes. When we lose steam, we\naren’t tied closely enough to any of those aspects, which come together to\ncreate motivation.\n \nWhat is motivation? Things that really matter to you and are near and dear\nto your heart. Things that make you actually want to work toward your\ngoal. Things that not only drive you, but also discourage you from giving\nup. On top of that, you have to minimize negative consequences involved\nwith your work and simultaneously maximize the positive benefits that you\nreceive.\n\f\nThere are many ways to define the concept of motivation, but an effective\nframework to view them through is external and internal motivations.\n \nExternal Motivators\n \nExternal motivators entail using sources besides yourself as motivation to\ndo something. They are other people or circumstances that drive you to\naction. You are doing something to avoid a negative circumstance or earn a\npositive circumstance from people and things outside of you.\n \nMore typically, external motivators are about avoiding negative\nconsequences. For example, you might be trying to avoid disappointing\nyour family by failing, so you are determined to succeed. You might be\nafraid of getting fired, so you act with aplomb. A majority of these\nmotivators are punishments or negative consequences that you are desperate\nto avoid. The only positive external motivation is self-bribery.\n \nStill, you can get a lot of mileage out of external motivators if you make\nthem work to your advantage. Driving yourself to avoid a negative\nconsequence can serve as an excellent push to do something. No one wants\nto suffer. If you know that not following through will result in some sort of\nsuffering, you will do anything to avoid that negative consequence.\nTherefore, you feel as if you have no choice but to follow through.\n \nAccountability partners. Accountability partners are people who hold you\naccountable. This is a person that you commit to something with. This\nperson lets you know when you need to do things, and he or she chides you\nwhen you want to give up. Then he or she gets on your case for not\nfollowing through.\n \nSince you want to avoid disappointing this person, you are more likely to\nact. You rely on this person to give you the external motivation to avoid\nshame so you become accountable for your actions and your goal to avoid\nhis or her negative feedback. You may also become accountable in order to\navoid letting this person down, as he or she counts on you to complete the\ngoal with him or her.\n\f\nAccountability group. An accountability group can be more effective than a\nsingle partner. By having multiple people holding you accountable, you\nface the possibility of exponential shame—the shame and disappointment\nof multiple people building on top of each other is a horrible feeling that\nyou will want to avoid. Plus, you will still have people to hold you\naccountable should one person drop out of the race. It can be hard to rely on\na single partner’s commitment, but a group is much steadier in its pressure.\nHaving more people to answer to and to guide you can help you stay on\ntrack to avoid shame.\n \nPutting money down. The risk of losing money is another motivator that\nyou can use to your advantage. A good example of this is an expensive gym\nmembership fee that makes you want to go to the gym more often. You\ndon’t want to waste money, so you go to the gym just to make that fee you\npaid worthwhile.\n \nAnother example is paying a lot of money for a course. You want to finish\nthe course because you paid so much for it and you consider it a shame to\njust waste that fee. By investing in something monetarily upfront and even\nslightly before you feel ready, you’ll be pushed to follow through to avoid\nwasting and losing money. The primary operator here is guilt for spending\nmoney on something that you never used or did.\n \nYou can take monetary investment motivators to the next level by hiring a\ncoach or trainer of some type. This is the next level because paying\nsomeone money to hold you accountable combines both monetary\ninvestments and accountability partners. Now you have two reasons not to\nquit or back out of your commitment. You don’t want to waste money or\nhear about how you have failed from a disappointed accountability partner.\n \nFinally, you can give someone money and then tell them not to give it to\nyou until you complete something. When you give a friend $500 and\ninstruct them not to return it to you until you complete your tasks, you’ll\nquickly discover just how much your work ethic is worth to you. If $500 is\n\f\nnot enough, up the ante next time to make it truly something you’ll work\ntoward.\n \nSelf-bribery. A final external motivator is to bribe yourself. This is where\nyou promise yourself a reward if you follow through. Therefore, you let that\nreward drive you and surmount your difficulties. For example, you might\nknow that you can take your dream beach vacation if you save your money\nwisely and earn enough to have spare. Keeping the emotions of the beach\nvacation can be powerful reminders every time you want to spend your\nmoney.\n \nExternal motivations are mostly about avoiding pain, so figure out what\npains you are avoiding or can create for yourself. Then let your urge to\navoid those pains drive you. Avoiding negative social emotions works well\nbecause no one wants to feel shame, guilt, or rejection. Use your fear of\nnegative social emotions to carry you through a project or commitment to\nthe very end.\n \nInternal Motivators\n \nInternal motivators are about what you want, as opposed to avoiding a\nnegative consequence or punishment.\n \nIf you are motivated by avoiding a negative consequence, but you realize at\nsome point that maybe negative consequence won’t actually kill you so you\ncan deal with it, there goes your motivation—you’ll simply deal with the\nconsequences sometimes.\n \nIn some cases, relying on external motivators and fear does not work as\nwell as going after the things you love and want. Therefore, internal\nmotivators are often better sources of motivation than external ones. We can\nview it thusly: if you are driven by fear or face a substantial negative\nconsequence, external motivation is ideal, while internal motivation is more\nsuitable if you know what you want and there is little to fear.\n\f\nInternal motivators are your “why” for taking action and putting in effort.\nThink of a donkey walking forward to reach the carrot. Internal motivators\nare the carrot, while external motivators are the stick. External motivators\ndrive you forward out of fear of something unpleasant, while internal\nmotivators make you feel that reaching your goal is going to give you a big\nreward and lots of pleasant benefits.\n \nThe more internal motivations you can articulate, the more motivated you\nwill be to follow through and finish. Ask the following questions to\ndetermine how you will benefit, then let your desire for those benefits drive\nyou forward. Internal motivations tend to be more uniform because they\nspeak to people’s universal desires and needs.\n \nWhat are you getting out of this? Maybe you are getting money or a sense\nof happiness and fulfillment in life. You are getting closer to a goal, which\ncan mean a lot in terms of benefits.\n \nHow will your life change or benefit? You may be able to get a better home\nor a nicer car if you earn more money. Or you may be able to recover from\ndepression and ultimate sadness by attaining a higher sense of fulfillment.\n \nHow will your family benefit? Your family means a lot to you, so let them\nmotivate you. Imagine the smiles on their faces as you give them a better\nlife and make them proud. Imagine getting your kids better school clothes,\nliving in a safer neighborhood, and being able to afford private school and\ncollege.\n \nWhat impact will you have on others? Perhaps you will become a role\nmodel for some people, which in turn will make you feel important and\ngood about yourself. Perhaps you can donate to charity or gift needy people\nwith clothes and shoes come winter. Perhaps you can donate money to erect\nnew structures in your community that will be named after you.\n \nWhat positive emotions will you get? Consider the happiness, pride, and\nself-esteem you will reap from your goal’s ultimate completion. After all,\nthis may be the root of all philanthropic efforts.\n\f\nHow will your actions lead to your long-term and short-term goals? Are\nyou accomplishing steps toward your goals? Think of the things you must\ndo to finish a novel, for example, such as research and actual word count.\nThen think of the steps you take each day toward those goals.\n \nUsing internal motivators in your daily life can really help you follow\nthrough with every task you have to complete. Even when the going gets\ntough and you contemplate giving up, finishing what you start is way easier\nwhen you are focused on how your world will benefit. So whenever you\nhave to do something that you hate, think of how it will bring you closer to\nyour goals. Or whenever you find yourself bored or tired while working on\nyour goals, consider how great you will feel when you finish. Every day,\nreview your goals and why you want to complete them. Then let that fill\nyou with motivation to drive you forward toward project completion.\n \nAnswer the above questions and consider writing them down somewhere.\nReview the answers periodically to remind yourself why you want to\nchange or improve your status quo.\n \nUnderstand Opportunity Cost\n \nFollowing through and finishing what you start will always call for\nsacrifice.\n \nYou have to spend money, expend effort, and give up time that you could\nuse for doing things you love in order to commit to things you have to\ncomplete. Since by definition no one likes sacrifice, sometimes the looming\nshadow of a sacrifice will overshadow your goals—unless you create\nmotivators powerful enough to overpower your sense of sacrifice and make\neach sacrifice seem worthwhile.\n \nEverything in life is an opportunity cost, which means that everything you\ndo will call for something from you. Every act takes away time or effort\nthat could be committed to something else. Learning to play the guitar\nmeans solitary hours of drilling scales, chords, and dealing with painful\n\f\ncalluses on your fingers. Going to college entails getting up early and\nheading to a boring lecture and spending hours doing homework. Are you\nready to make the trade-off?\n \nIf the opportunity cost is too expensive for you to want to pay it, then you\nwill not follow through. Therefore, you must find a motivator that drives\nyou to accept the opportunity cost. If you don’t feel motivated enough to\npay that cost, then you are guaranteed to lose steam and give up.\n \nTherefore, there are two ways to solve this problem. The first is that your\nmotivation must be even stronger and more salient in order to make you\nignore these opportunity costs and the things you are missing out on. The\nmotivation must mean more to you than the things you sacrifice to make\nyou feel that this is all worth it.\n \nThe second solution is to make your sacrifices smaller. This means that\nthere is less pain associated with getting things done. In both cases, the\ncost-benefit analysis must be significantly weighed in favor of the benefit—\nbut the first method manipulates the benefit, while the second method\nmanipulates the cost.\n \nAn example of this is giving give up your weekly Friday night out with\nfriends to go to a late-night history class. This class is essential to getting\nthe degree you need to break into your dream career. But you sure do love\nyour night out with friends. To use the first solution, your desire to get into\nthis career and better your life and feel proud of yourself must outweigh\nhow much you love Friday nights out. You must keep in mind that your life\nwill drastically change for the better if you can resist a few Friday nights.\nOtherwise, you will find the conflict too great to overcome and you will\nquit the class in favor of your friends.\n \nLet’s apply the second solution for the same results. Instead of just giving\nup on your Friday night out, schedule a different night or drum up the\nenergy to go out after class and spend just a little less time with your friends\nevery Friday night. You’re turning a full sacrifice into a compromised\n\f\nsacrifice. The end result is a compromise that makes it possible to keep\ndoing what you want while also working on your goals.\n \nWhen faced with opportunity cost and potential sacrifice, keep in mind that\nyour life can’t continue 100% as you want it to—but if you focus on\nincreasing the benefit or minimizing the sacrifice, you can continue\nprogress toward your goals while staying motivated and not listless.\n \nKeep Your Motivation on Your Mind\n \nInternal and external motivators are great ways to fuel the productivity and\ncommitment required for following through. But they won’t do anything for\nyou if they are out of sight and out of mind.\n \nAccording to Psychological Science, people are more inclined to follow\nthrough if they are exposed to stimuli that remind them of their motivators.\nSeeing or hearing their motivators can drive them to maintain motivation.\nIn other words, sometimes the simplest solutions work best: constant\nreminders will keep you on track because our minds can only fixate on so\nmany things.\nAdditionally, Katherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania\ndeveloped the hypothesis that reminders through association could aid\npeople in remembering goals and following through with them.\nTo confirm this hypothesis, she conducted a study whose participants were\nasked to complete an hour-long computer task. They were promised\ncompensation as well as a dollar donated to the local food bank. They were\nasked to make sure their donations were made by picking up paperclips\nwhen they got their compensation. The control group was told this and then\nthanked for their time. The test group was told that the paper clips would be\nwaiting by an elephant statue.\nIt turned out that 74% of the group told about the elephant statue\nremembered to get their paper clips at the end of the study. Only 42% of the\nmembers of the other group remembered to do this. Having the visual cue\nof the elephant statue actually made it easier for students to remember to\n\f\ncomplete the simple task. When students saw the unusual statue, it sparked\ntheir memories far more than ordinary-looking notes.\nOn top of that, Rogers and Milkman discovered that having very noticeable\ncues worked better than cues that did not stand out. For example, a written\nreminder did not remind study participants as well as a visual cue such as\none of the aliens from Toy Story.\nTherefore, the best way to make motivators work for you is to expose\nyourself to them often. You can use cues to help prompt you to keep your\nmotivation in mind and thus to follow through. However, these cues also\nneed to stand out to you.\nFor instance, use loud, vivid images that you can’t ignore, or employ other\nsenses and include sounds, textures, and scents. Include a picture on your\ndesk of your child to remind you to keep working toward your dream for a\nbetter financial future for your family—but make the picture frame smell of\nyour child’s shampoo or your spouse’s perfume or cologne. To emphasize,\nwe aren’t just talking about visual aids of putting Post-its everywhere—the\ncues we can use can be spread across our five senses in imaginative and\ncreative ways.\nHowever, be sure to move and change these cues around every few days so\nthat you do not become too accustomed to them and start to ignore them as\npart of the background noise of your life.\nFinally, you can also write your motivators down every few days with\ndifferent phrasing. Again, be sure to change them up to avoid getting too\nused to them. The act of creating the cue each repeatedly helps to keep the\nmotivation firm and fresh in your mind.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nHow do we stay hungry and motivated? By delving deep and really\nasking what internal and external motivators you have at your\ndisposal—a task that is rarely performed.\nExternal motivators are when we leverage other people, places, and\nthings to push us into action. For the most part, these are when we\nwant to avoid negative consequences involving other people,\n\f\nplaces, and things. These methods include accountability partners\nand groups, putting money down upfront, and self-bribery.\nInternal motivators are when we look at how we stand to benefit\nand improve our lives. These are universal needs, drives, and\ndesires that are easy to lose track of. The easy way to find these is\nto answer a set of questions that directly asks things such as how am\nI going to benefit from this and how does my life stand to improve\nfrom this? It’s only through answering these questions that you\nrealize what you are neglecting.\nAnything we want to accomplish has an associated opportunity\ncost. We must sacrifice, even if we are sacrificing our ability to lie\non the couch and watch television. We can deal with this mental\nobstacle by playing with the cost-benefit ratio so the cost is\nminimized or the benefit is maximized.\nMotivation has been shown to work best when we are reminded of\nit—otherwise, out of sight, out of mind. Thus, you should have cues\nyou’re your motivations all around you—but make sure to keep\nthem distinct and memorable, use all five senses (even taste), and\nmake sure to change and switch them periodically to avoid growing\nused to them and forgetting them."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 3: Create a Manifesto\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYou will face forks in the road where you must deliberate between\nfollowing through or giving up. Instead of having to make the hard decision\nand reach deep into your willpower toolbag every single time, having rules\nfor yourself can help you decide which direction to take whenever you\nreach the fork.\n \nWe’ve been told since we were young that we have to follow rules. Well,\nthis time we can choose our own rules that will ultimately help us\naccomplish exactly what we want.\n \nRules can generally be called mental models, which can be critical to\nfollow-through. This is because they create a set way that you have to make\nevery decision, no exceptions. With your decisions already made for you by\nyour rules, you thus make decisions automatically and you no longer have\nroom to make the wrong decision based on waning willpower and self-\ndiscipline, which is to give up.\n \nRules hold you accountable so that you are not winging it every day but\ninstead are guided. Use your rules to guide your worldview and your daily\nactions. Let them make every decision for you.\n \nA good example of a rule is to always complete two tasks on your to-do list\nfor your goal every day. It’s simply unacceptable to not do this—you have\nto complete the steps no matter what. As a result, you’ll find that you make\n\f\nprogress toward your goal, even when you don’t want to. The choice was\nout of your hands. Deciding to work each day is not your decision to make;\nit has already been made for you by your rule, and thus you have no choice\nbut to do it.\n \nConsider an example of when John, a writer, doesn’t use the rule of always\ncompleting two steps on his to-do list.\n \nIn the morning, he is excited and thinks, “After work, I will go home and\nstart writing my novel! I will write two chapters.” Then he goes to work and\ngrows fatigued and loses his inspiration slowly but surely throughout the\nday. By the time he gets home, all he wants to do is watch Gossip Girl. So\nsince he does not have this rule in place, he fails to write. He has made zero\nprogress and is far from his goal. The sense of guilt that plagues him is\nhorrible. As he goes to bed, he vows to himself that he will make up for the\nlost progress by writing four chapters tomorrow.\n \nWhat do you think will happen then? He comes home tired and defeated\nagain. He lets the fact that work drains him become his excuse for not\nwriting. Moreover, since he faces the monumental task of writing four\nchapters today, it feels impossible to start on. If he didn’t have energy for\ntwo chapters the night before, he certainly won’t have the energy for four\nchapters tonight. He gets overwhelmed and doesn’t write at all. It seems as\nif he will never finish this novel because he always finds some excuse to let\nhimself off of the hook from actually writing.\n \nHe gave himself too much choice and leeway and thus allowed self-\nsabotage all too easily.\n \nNow let’s consider if John applied the rule every day, which is black and\nwhite and doesn’t care about fatigue. No matter how tired and uninspired he\nfeels, he knows that he has to write two chapters a night after work, no\nexceptions and no excuses. So when he gets home, he looks at his computer\nand he feels tempted to just go watch TV and conserve his energy by being\nlazy. But because he follows a rule in his life, he can’t break it and so he has\nto write. In fact, he plans for it all day because he knows it’s coming. He"

    "raw_text": "sits down and tackles the two chapters and goes to bed exhausted but\ncontented and proud of himself. He has made significant progress on his\nnovel. Pretty soon, he is done with his novel and the feeling of\naccomplishment is worth the energy he had to spend on the novel when he\nwas drained after work.\n \nRules help you follow through because they limit your vision. When you\nare robbed of your decision-making power—the same power that leads you\nto fiddle with social media when important tasks need to be done—then\nyour hands are tied and following through is the only choice you have.\n \nThis chapter is about creating a set of rules, collectively a manifesto, for\nyou to follow every time you come across a fork in the road. They push and\nguide you into the right direction and avoid depleting the willpower you do\nhave. Here are a few ideas for you.\n \nRule 1: Evaluate Yourself\n \nRule 1 is to ask yourself, “If not for laziness or fear, would I be giving up?”\nThis makes it very clear to yourself that you are not acting out of a lack of\nability or talent, but rather you are just taking the easy way out. Is that what\nyou want to admit to yourself? When you face the fact that you are being\nlazy or fearful head-on, it makes you not want to be that way anymore. It’s\nthe kick in the butt that forces you to call yourself lazy/fearful and then\ndrives you to take action.\n \nRealizing that only fear or laziness stands in your way helps you realize\nhow silly that is so you get over it. So before you give up, make it a rule\nthat you always ask yourself if it is laziness or fear that is holding you back\nfrom action.\n \nLet’s say that you have a goal to make a certain amount of money by\ndelivering so many projects to your clients in a month. But the work is hard\nand you find yourself losing motivation. You want to stop working and take\nseveral days off. Ask yourself, “Am I just being lazy?” That kicks your butt\n\f\ninto gear and you take action. You do your work and you feel better about\nyourself knowing that you are doing the best you can.\n \nRule 2: Three Tasks Maximum\n \nRule 2 is to focus on three things a day maximum. Only. Tops. Being\noverwhelmed or disorganized can kill your ability to get things done.\nSometimes we can’t follow through on what we want because we don’t plan\nsmartly. We give ourselves too much to do and we become overwhelmed.\nBut using this rule enables you to plan against that problem by only\nallowing yourself to focus on three things a day maximum. Plan how to\nreduce your focus to only three things by deciding on what they are going\nto be the night before. Prepare to focus only on those things so that you can\nplan logically and not react emotionally.\n \nOne setback you’ll face when you attempt to limit yourself to three main\ntasks a day is differentiation. Specifically, you will need to learn to\ndifferentiate between important things and urgent things. Important things\nmust be done and should make it to your top three, while urgent things are\nnot necessary.\n \nUrgent things will seem important and will cause you stress, but they may\nnot actually be important or take priority. An urgent thing might be making\ntime for a harried client who is rushing you. Meanwhile, getting a project to\na client before the deadline is an example of an important task. Everything\non your agenda will appear important and urgent so you must determine\nwhich is which and plan accordingly.\n \nSimilarly, differentiate between useless motion that looks busy but gets\nnothing done and actual action, which is movement toward what you want.\nUseless motion is shifting papers around your desk, while actual action is\nusing those papers to get work done and make progress on a project. Make\nwhat really matters the priority.\n \nHow might you use this rule is to set an agenda for yourself? Suppose you\nhave five tasks to do for your business. Two of the tasks are not really\n\f\nimportant and only appear to be since they are urgent, so you decide to\nfocus on them later.\n \nYou pick three tasks to focus on, and you evaluate which one is most\nimportant so that you can focus on that first. The night before, look at those\nthree items on your to-do list and determine what steps you will take in\nactual action to complete those items, starting with the most important one.\nThe next day, take that actual action for your first task, then your second,\nthen your third. Only complete one task at a time and do not multitask. By\nthe close of the workday, you just completed three major tasks at a realistic\npace!\n \nRule 3: Create Limitations and Requirements\n \nRule 3 is to make actual rules for yourself. Create an actual code of conduct\nfor you to follow in terms of being more disciplined and following through\nmore. Write your code down in detail and then post it in a visible area.\nWhile you may not adhere to all of them every day, you at least stand a\nbetter chance of follow-through when you actually take the time to think\nabout your code of conduct and write them down.\n \nThe rules should focus on creating either limitations or requirements for\nwhat you do each day so that you actually take initiative and get tasks done.\n \nThis rule forces you to determine what you really need and want and\nanalyze what you hope to achieve. Basically, you are stopping to check\nyourself and evaluate how you are progressing toward your ultimate goal. It\nhelps you focus more on your intentions and clarify them, making them an\nintegral part of your work ethic. So when you set out to accomplish\nsomething, you have a rule in place to make yourself follow through on the\nproject.\n \nGive yourself five daily limitations and five daily requirements. Make clear\nstatements about what you cannot do and what you must do.\n\f\nLimitations are relatively easy to understand. They limit distraction and\ntemptation. As for requirements, understand that you are not Superman or\nSuperwoman, so you can’t overload yourself. Instead, work smarter and\nhave five requirements that you can reasonably meet. You may not always\nadhere to this rule, but you at least have some guidance for yourself. In\naddition, you gain some clarity about what you have cut out for you each\nday.\n \nAn example is to set a limitation that you will not watch more than one hour\nof TV a day, you will not spend more than an hour on Facebook, and you\nwill not take longer than a one-hour lunch break. Meanwhile, your\nrequirements are that you must read at least 30 pages a day, you must\ncomplete at least four hours of work before lunch, and you must complete\neight hours of work total by the time you sign out or clock out of work.\n \nRule 4: Reaffirm Your Intentions\n \nRule 4 is quite similar to rule 1. This rule comes into play when you are\nfaced with a fork in the road between deciding to follow through or not.\nThis rule seeks to reaffirm your intentions by reminding yourself what they\nare and why you want to achieve them.\n \nWhen you find yourself deliberating between quitting and following\nthrough, ask these three questions to yourself. Better yet, have the answers\nwritten somewhere so you can look over again.\n \n“I want…” This is where you state your end goal and how you will benefit\nfrom it. What is your reason and motivation? Keep reminding yourself of\nthe external or internal motivators that you have on your side. Remind\nyourself something like, “I want to be rich.”\n \n“I will…” This is where you state how you must reach that end goal and all\nthe work you should be doing to get there. This statement brings your\nattention back to how necessary it is to complete what you are currently\ndoing and how these tasks tie into the end goal. The journey is a necessary\npart of the goal. It helps for you to be very specific in this statement to see\n\f\nwhat actions you really do have to take. For example, tell yourself, “If I\nwant to be rich, I will need to finish this project and work hard on other\nprojects.”\n \n“I won’t…” This is where you state what you shouldn’t do because that\naction will impede your progress toward your end goal. There are many\nthings detrimental to your progress, including distractions, temptations, lack\nof discipline, procrastination, and other destructive or wasteful actions. Tell\nyourself something like, “If I want to be rich, I won’t distract myself with\nsocial media and I won’t prioritize social media over my work projects.”\n \nLet’s apply this concept to a potential real-life conundrum that you may\nencounter. As you work to complete a certification program necessary to\nget a pay raise at work, you find the volume of work overwhelming and you\ndespise having so little free time on your hands. You contemplate giving up\nand saying “whatever” to the certification. After all, you have a job, so do\nyou really need to advance yourself anymore?\n \nAs you contemplate this, realize that this is the time when you should apply\nthis rule because you have hit a fork in the road of follow-through. You\nchoose to implement the rule and you state three things to yourself:\n \n“I want to make more money at work and be able to afford a nicer home for\nmyself and a future family.”\n \n“If I want to have more money and move into a better place, I will finish\nthis certification program in order to get a raise at work.”\n \n“If I want to make more money at work and move into a better place, I\nwon’t let myself get discouraged and stop doing the work to complete this\nprogram or be thrown off track by simple temptations or laziness.”\n \nYou have just stated your intentions from beginning to end. As you may\nhave noticed, a running theme in this book is that repetition helps follow\nthrough, and presence of mind is key. We may have the best intentions, but\nif we simply forget about them, then what good are they? When you face"

    "raw_text": "these questions constantly—your end goal and the steps you must take to\nreach, as well as the steps you must not take to reach it—it all becomes\ncrystal clear.\n \nRule 5: Think in Terms of 10-10-10\n \nThe next time you feel that you’re about to give in to an urge or temptation,\nstop and ask yourself how you will feel 10 minutes, 10 hours, and 10 days\nfrom now. This rule may not seem all that powerful, but it’s effective\nbecause it forces you to think about your future self and to see how your\nactions are going to affect yourself in the future—for better or worse. A lot\nof times, we may know that we are losing willpower or doing something\nharmful in the moment, but that’s not enough to stop us from doing it\nbecause we don’t have any connection to our future self that will have to\ndeal with the consequences. This rule quickly creates that connection, and\nthat can make the difference between a success or failure of discipline.\n \nWhy time intervals of 10 minutes, hours, and days? Because that helps you\nrealize how short-term the pleasure or comfort of a discipline is relative to\nits long-term consequences. At 10 minutes, you might be feeling good, with\nperhaps just the initial bit of shame creeping in. After 10 hours, you’ll feel\nmostly shame a regret. Ten days later, you might be consumed by regret\nhaving realized some of the negative consequences that your decision or\naction has had on your pursuit of your long-term goals.\n \nOn the other hand, you might apply this rule and realize that a lapse in\nfollowing through now won’t make a difference 10 days into the future. If\nthat’s the case, then you can indulge a bit without guilt or shame.\n \nFor example, imagine that you apply this rule when deciding whether or not\nto skip a workout to go to dinner with coworkers. If you’ve just begun\nexercising and haven’t built it into a consistent habit yet, your decision to\nskip a single workout might increase the odds of skipping future workouts\nor stopping working out altogether.\n\f\nHow will you feel in 10 minutes, hours, and days? Ten minutes—good,\nwith a slight tinge of regret, as you can still taste the lasagna or ice cream.\nThe pleasure is still tangible. Ten hours—almost entirely regret, as the\npleasure is gone and fleeting, and your diet has been soundly broken. Ten\ndays—100% regret, because the broken discipline is now completely\nmeaningless and but a faint memory. The lasagna does not have a lasting\nbenefit, but it does have a lasting cost.\n \nOn the other hand, if exercising is already a consistent and enjoyable habit\nfor you, then imagining how you’ll feel 10 days from now will quickly\nshow you that one skipped workout isn’t harmful to your long-term\ndiscipline or goals.\n \nAnd when you’re not swayed by this rule or your dilemma of willpower is\nextra difficult, you can add a final question for yourself. That is, how will\nbreaking willpower now affect you in 10 weeks or even longer-term? You\nmight want to change the parameters to 10 weeks if you’re mostly engaged\nin longer-term decisions and tasks.\n \nIn this process, it’s crucial to be honest with yourself and wary of your own\nabilities to rationalize and make excuses. For example, you may have tried\nto quit an addictive habit many times in the past, only to fail and eventually\nreinforce the harmful behavior. If you have a history of falling into bad\nhabits after a single lapse in discipline, then an honest assessment of how\nyou would feel after 10 days or 10 weeks will tell you that you simply can’t\nafford a lapse in discipline now if you’re going to achieve your long-term\ngoals. It wasn’t an exception or justified in that one circumstance—it is a\nreflection of your character for better or worse.\n \nWithout that honesty and ability to see your own rationalizing and excuses\nfor what they are, applying this rule may be a futile exercise.\n \nRule 6: Just 10 Minutes\n \nThe final rule is simple, easy, and powerful."

    "raw_text": "If you want something negative, harmful, or detrimental to your follow\nthrough, wait at least 10 minutes before getting it. It’s simple and leaves no\nroom for debate or excuses. When you feel an urge, force yourself to wait\nfor 10 minutes before giving in to whatever the urge is. If you’re still\ncraving it after 10 minutes, then have it. Or wait 10 more minutes because\nyou’ve already done it and survived just fine. Simply by choosing to wait\nyou remove the “immediate” from immediate gratification—building\ndiscipline and improving decision-making.\n \nSimilarly, if you want to quit something beneficial, wait just 10 more\nminutes. It’s the same thought process applied in a different way. Ten\nminutes is nothing, so you can wait or continue that long easily. Then, if\nyou do it once, it’s easy to repeat, isn’t it? In other words, say to yourself\n“just 10 minutes more of willpower” each time you reach a fork in the road.\n \nAnother benefit of this rule is the purposeful escalation of good habits. If\nyou’ve forced yourself to do something productive for 10 minutes, you\nmight end up doing it for 15 or even 20 minutes more. Next time, your\ntolerance will build such that you’re more immune to temptation and\ndistraction—the following time you might continue for an extra six or seven\nminutes.\n \nEvery time you feel distracted, just exercise willpower for a few minutes\nlonger, and you’ll steadily follow through better with each escalation. At\nsome iteration of “just 10 minutes more” you’ll reach a point of momentum,\nand that’s often enough to carry you for hours.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nA manifesto is nothing more than a set of rules to follow every day.\nWe might hate rules, but rules take the guesswork out of our days\nand give us guidelines to follow. They make matters black and\nwhite, which is helpful to following through because there is simply\nno other choice.\nRule 1: Are you acting out of laziness? If so, is this a\ncharacterization you want about yourself?\n\f\nRule 2: Three major tasks a day, maximum. Differentiate between\nimportant tasks, urgent tasks, and simple wasted motion.\nRule 3: Create daily limitations and requirements for yourself.\nThese keep you within the bounds of what you know you need to\ndo. These are also the building blocks of good habits.\nRule 4: Sometimes we lose sight of what we want to accomplish.\nThus, reaffirm your intentions by stating “I want,” “I will,” and “I\nwon’t” statements.\nRule 5: Try to look into the future, 10 minutes, hours, and days at a\ntime. Do you like what you see when you consider not following\nthrough? Is it worth the benefit to the current self at the expense of\nthe future self? Probably not.\nRule 6: It’s just 10 minutes, right? So if you want to quit, it’s just 10\nminutes. And if you need to wait, it’s just 10 minutes.\n\f\nChapter 4: Follow-Through Mindsets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollow-through is 100% mental. It takes a cognitive effort to follow through\non something, especially when you hit discouraging obstacles. Mindsets\nhelp with that.\n \nWhat is a mindset? A mindset is a set way of visualizing and approaching\nsituations and problems. Certain mindsets are all it takes to find the will and\nmotivation necessary to follow through on something.\n \nGerald is an example of someone with a mindset that impeded with his\nprogress. Gerald had many aspirations to create his own business. He was\ndetermined in spirit and relished the idea of one day being a well-known\nand rich entrepreneur like Steve Jobs. While he knew that success is not just\nsomething easy that anyone can grab, he did not realize how sometimes\nsuccess calls for uncomfortable situations.\n \nWhen he actually endeavored to start his own business, he ran into a lot of\nsituations that cause him fear. For example, he had to make a monetary\ninvestment and it terrified him to think that he may lose his money and\nnever get it back. This fear made Gerald uncomfortable. Another thing he\nhated was having to conserve his money and cut expenses and luxuries he\ndidn’t need to devote more money to his start-up. Living without the\nluxuries he was used to made him quite uncomfortable as well—so much so\nthat he could not handle it."

    "raw_text": "Instead of adapting to uncomfortable situations and embracing new things\nthat made him feel scared, Gerald freaked out. He decided that the lifestyle\nof an entrepreneur was not worth it. He liked the idea but was not prepared\nfor the reality. Finding out that starting up a new business was not all\nsunshine and rainbows made him give up on it. Instead of starting his dream\ncompany and having a shot at becoming the next Steve Jobs, Gerald settled\nback into the job that he hated simply because it was comfortable to him.\nHe never amounted to much and never reached his dreams as a result.\n \nGerald’s mindset was negative, to say the least. He refused to deal with\ndiscomfort or make sacrifices that were mildly unpleasant for his dream\ncareer. He preferred what he knew over the unknown, even though what he\nknew did not satisfy him as much as his dream would have satisfied him.\nThat mindset made him choose to approach the situation from the vantage\npoint that it was all bad and not worth it. He focused on the negative and the\ndiscomfort and he refused to work around it.\n \nGerald may have succeeded at his goal had he held a different mindset. But\nhis collection of poor and inflexible mental habits caused him to approach\nproblems incorrectly, which left him with no hope for success. He let\nhimself fail by approaching problems in the wrong way and eventually\ngiving up.\n \nHad he decided to become comfortable with discomfort, he never would\nhave given up just because the going got tough at one point. He could have\nadjusted to the discomfort of making sacrifices and embracing unknown\nscary situations, which would have made him better able to found his\nbusiness and become an entrepreneur.\n \nMindset 1: It’s Worthwhile\nConsider what the Chicago Consortium on School Reform (along with\nmany other educational experts) says motivates students to persevere even\nwhen things become difficult at school. Three concepts contribute to\nstudent success, which are easily transferable to our adult lives.\n\f\nThe first concept is holding the belief that hard work can and will lead to\nimprovement. No matter how hard things get, it is your efforts that will get\nyou the results you desire, nothing else. Everything else is a byproduct of\nluck—the hard work itself is a prerequisite. Of course, hard work doesn’t\novercome everything, but it’s an essential component that cannot be\nskipped.\nThe second concept is having the confidence that you, and people like you,\nbelong in school and that school is a place where you can thrive. You can\napply this to settings outside of school.\nThe heart of this concept is that you believe in yourself and that you are just\nas good as anyone else. Basically, you need to believe in your own abilities\nand trust in your opportunities. Don’t create self-limiting beliefs that hold\nyou back, such as thinking that you are not as good as everyone else. This\nbelief is illustrated by feeling that you also have valuable input at a business\nmeeting or that you have just as much ability to handle a client as everyone\nelse in the office.\nThe final concept is holding the belief that what you are doing is valuable\nand relevant to your goals. Why would you stick with doing something if\nyou don’t see how it benefits you or helps you reach your goals? That\nwould undermine entire chapters of this book.\nUnderstanding why you do something and how it fits into the big picture of\nwhat you are trying to accomplish makes it seem more worthwhile. You\nwon’t want to quit an endeavor if you think that it is getting you\nsomewhere. You don’t even have to see instant gratification and goal\ncompletion to know that you are on the right track. Assigning value and\nremembering how each thing you do ties into your main goal is very\nimportant because it helps you feel that you are doing well just by working.\nThere is a point to everything you do, so every action you take is valuable.\nAn example of this concept at work would be when you feel that the classes\nyou are taking for your degree are pointless. Remember that they are not\npointless, because they are leading to your graduation, which in turn will\nlead to your dream job in the field of your interest.\nThese concepts can help you because they lend value and meaning to your\nwork, and they can make you feel like you are making a difference just by"

    "raw_text": "following through and executing.\nMindset 2: Comfort with Discomfort\nAnother critical mindset is believing that your journey to success will\nbecome supremely uncomfortable at times, so you need to get comfortable\nwith discomfort. Following through is never comfortable because it asks\nyou to do things that are unfamiliar and new. To be successful and never\ngive up, you need to minimize negative consequences of uncomfortable\nsituations by getting immunized to the sense of discomfort.\nSometimes, you feel the need to avoid something that will lead to success\nout of discomfort. Maybe you are avoiding extra work because you are\nfatigued, or you are avoiding talking to new people because it makes you\nnervous. You are actively shutting out success because you want to avoid\nbeing uncomfortable for a little while.\nTherefore, overcoming your instinct to avoid things just because they are\nuncomfortable for you at first is essential. Change is always uncomfortable,\nbut it is key to doing things differently in order to find that magical formula\nfor success. Try doing new things outside of your comfort zone. Do\nsomething new, try to learn new skills, talk to new people, and practice new\nactions that you are bad at until you are good at them. Expose yourself to\nnew situations and things. The unfamiliarity will feel very uncomfortable,\nbut you will not be able to expand your horizons and achieve success any\nother way.\nThe more you do things that make you uncomfortable, the more\ncomfortable you become with discomfort. You will find that discomfort is a\ntemporary emotion that leaves with exposure to the situation. The benefits\nof being uncomfortable far outweigh the mild and fleeting unpleasantness\nof the sensation. Your mind will come to stop fearing discomfort so much\nwhen it realizes that discomfort does not actually hurt you.\nMeanwhile, staying comfortable by only doing what you know is a bad\nidea. It is the recipe for complacency and for staying static. You will not\nmake any changes if you do what you always do.\nDon’t ever give up on things just because they call for some change and\ndiscomfort. Discomfort is merely your fear instinct at play and does not\nactually hurt you, so getting comfortable with it is a good idea.\n\f\nYou can choose to stay home and not meet new people, or you can choose\nto go out and make valuable connections that will help you reach your\ngoals. You can choose to never learn a new language, or you can choose to\nlearn it and find a wealth of new business opportunities, such as fun jobs\noverseas or well-paying jobs in translation. By repeatedly going to language\nclasses and talking to new people, you will become conditioned to the\nsensation of going out of your comfort zone. Thus, you will become\ncomfortable with being uncomfortable. Then you will stop fearing\ndiscomfort and you will open yourself up to some positive changes in your\nlife. Just push yourself consistently every day and try new things to expand\nthe edges of your comfort zone and make your life what you dream about.\nMindset 3: Allow Learning\nThis mindset entails developing the viewpoint that following through and\nfinishing equals learning and evaluating yourself. You are essentially testing\nand scoring yourself based on your progress. Giving up is an automatic\nfailure.\nWhen you finish something, on the other hand, you ace the test. You get to\nsee how you do and you get to evaluate your performance. You also gain a\nlot of valuable skills and information that can help form your success and\nenable you to try again with better success should you ever fail at\nsomething.\nYou only learn certain things if you see them through to the end. You are in\na constant state of seeking information and knowledge, which you can only\ngain when you complete a project in its entirety. Otherwise, you don’t catch\nthe full glimpse of how things work. You get to learn about what it takes to\nfinish something and what you are made of if you follow through. If you\ndon’t follow through, then you don’t learn all that you have to do and you\ndon’t learn anything about yourself except that you are lazy or afraid or a\nfailure.\nYou can also teach yourself what doesn’t work. If you follow through to the\nend and still don’t succeed, you can evaluate your work and see where you\nwent wrong. Then you can avoid that issue in the future. You can become\nmore successful in the future as a result. View life as a series of lessons that\nyou can use for future betterment.\n\f\nViewing your endeavors as quests for knowledge can make challenges seem\nless daunting. It takes the fear out of failing because you still gain\nknowledge. You will be less inclined to just give up when faced with a\nchallenge because you instead want to learn how to work around the\nchallenge. You want to see what happens when you try something to\novercome the challenge. You will gain no knowledge if you don’t follow\nthrough, so you have to have the mindset to leap over challenges more\nfearlessly.\nOne way to adopt this mindset is to ask yourself, “What can I learn from\nthis?” That breeds a thirst for knowledge, which can be infinitely more\nmotivating than any other mindset. You get curious and you want to see\nwhat the finish line looks like. You want to gain the experience that your\nendeavor can give you, so you go after follow-through in order to get that\nexperience.\nMindset 4: De-Stress\nStress affects how much willpower and self-control you have. You may not\nbe consciously aware, but think about how little you can get done if you’re\nstressed out or anxious. Even more so if you’re simply tired and fatigued.\nYour working spirit is more delicate than you might imagine, which is why\nit’s important to protect it and de-stress.\nAn Australian study showed that students who were stressed because of\ntheir exams neglected healthy habits like maintaining a proper diet, getting\nenough sleep, and exercising. They also smoked more, consumed more\ncaffeine, struggled with controlling their emotions, and paid less attention to\nhousehold chores, self-care habits, commitments, and spending.\nIt’s easy to conclude the following: if you fail to take care of your mental\nhealth, your discipline and willpower quickly deteriorate. Prevent this\nsituation by introducing stress-reducing habits in your life. Each day, spend\nat least 30 minutes doing relaxing activities. Meet with friends. Read a\nbook. Listen to music. Meditate. Exercise. Cuddle. Take a walk in the\nwoods. Whatever works for you to unwind and turn your brain off.\nIt’s important to relax when you can and overall be aware of your affect—\nthe psychological term for the emotions you are feeling and overall\ntemperament.\n\f\nWhy? Because negative affect is among the most important triggers of self-\ncontrol failure. For instance, depressed people desire specific things that\nbring immediate gratification and procrastinate or avoid any activity that\ninvolves effort. Emotional distress causes a behavioral shift toward\nimmediate improvements in mood, and so people make poor decisions. This\ngets even worse when you realize that projection bias occurs every day\nwithout our conscious knowledge.\n \nProjection bias is when people falsely project their current feelings onto\ntheir future feelings. If you feel depressed, stressed, and tired, you imagine\nyou’ll feel that way next time you want to follow through and finish\nsomething. Of course, there’s no correlation, but people routinely fail to see\nthat there is no solid connection between these feelings.\n \nFor example, people condemn junk food when they aren’t hungry without\nrealizing how much they want those delicious cookies once they are hungry.\nWhen you plan your diet, you are probably calm and in a mood to make\ndrastic changes. You can also see projection bias as overenthusiasm that\nyour current feelings are how you will feel about something forever.\n \nPoint being? Don’t underestimate the impact of stress on your ability to\nfollow through.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nFollowing through is 100% mental, which means it’s probably a\ngood idea to talk about the mindsets you attempt to embody.\nMindset 1: It’s all worthwhile. If you feel that your hard work will\nget you somewhere, you belong and are as good as anyone else, and\nyou feel impact toward your overall goals, execution is easier to\nstick with.\nMindset 2: Become comfortable with discomfort. Everything you\nwant to do will have elements of discomfort, unless you just want to\nwatch television all day by yourself. Thus, becoming used to this\nfeeling allows you to tackle what you want without fear.\n\f\nMindset 3: Without following through, there is no learning. Only\nwhen you finish something can you evaluate yourself and correct\nyour errors. Embody an information-gathering mindset.\nMindset 4: The detrimental power of stress and anxiety can’t be\noverstated. Even being in a poor mood is dangerous to your\nproductivity and follow-through. Be aware and take proactive\nmeasures to modulate your stress levels.\n\f\nChapter 5: The Science of Smashing Procrastination\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcrastination is a huge problem in following through. How can you\napproach it effectively?\n \nMadeleine has a big project coming up soon. Her deadline is in a week. She\nknows that to meet this deadline, she has to complete 15 pages of code a\nday. But when it comes down to it, she just cannot work. So she puts it off,\nplanning to write 30 the next day to make up for lost progress. Then she\ncan’t write 30 pages so she puts it off and now has to write 45. Now she is\nright on her deadline with almost no code written.\n \nShe pulls an all-nighter and sends in a code that is rife with errors. She ran\ninto many challenges with this code that she did not have time to solve\nbecause she was so far behind in work. The client rejects the code and is not\nhappy. Madeleine just earned a bad review and no repeat client.\n \nMichelle works on the same types of projects. Unlike Madeleine, Michelle\nunderstands what her challenges may be. She breaks the work into small,\nmanageable parts and writes what she can each day and gives herself\nrewards for every section she completes. Usually she is able to meet or\nexceed the 15 pages minimum quota that she has set for herself. At the end\nof the week, she compiles the code with no errors and sends it to her client.\nHe is very happy to have a working code that runs well and he pays her\nwell. She earns a five-star review and the client is eager to hire her again for\nfuture projects.\n\f\nThe difference between these two coders is that Michelle succeeded at her\nproject by not procrastinating. She used a system called temptation\nbundling to ensure that she did not put off work. That gave her plenty of\ntime to not only write code but to find and fix bugs. Madeleine did not use\nthis foresight so she produced poor-quality work. You can see how\nprocrastination leads to intense stress, frustration, and sloppy work.\n \nWe all know what procrastination is. But why is such a common issue in\npeople trying to meet deadlines and get quality work done? There are some\nanswers regarding this covered by behavioral psychology.\n \nThe main component in this self-defeating habit is called time\ninconsistency. This is where humans value immediate and instant\ngratification over long-term rewards.\n \nImagine that you have two selves, a present self and a future self. In this\ninstance, they are completely different people with different desires that do\nnot overlap. When you make goals, you are making plans for your future\nself. It is easy to plan for what is best for your future self. You can see what\nyou need in the future and you want that so you plan for it. Researchers\nhave found that envisioning your ideal future reality is quite easy.\n \nHowever, only your present self can actually do anything. To make goals\nreality, your present self has to take action. Sadly, your present self wants\nrewards now. It does not want to wait to see the results in the future. So it\nwants to avoid having to do work for long-term goals, favoring instead\ntasks that reward you right now. For example, you want to get a big project\ndone to make money, but you really need a nap. You are going to choose the\nnap over work because that’s an immediate reward for your present self.\nMeanwhile, you are hurting your future self by napping instead of working.\n \nYour future self wants goals that pay out at some future date after work\nperformed in the present. The present self wants rewards that pay out now,\nwhich in turn often hurt your chances to get your future self its long-term\nrewards."

Waiting for a future\nreward is often not sufficient to motivate your present self because your\npresent self does not want to wait.\n \nTemptation Bundling\n \nTemptation bundling is an excellent and efficient way to kill procrastination\nand increase productivity by combining present and future selves and their\nconflicting needs.\n \nThis takes the above concept and introduces the means to reducing\ntemptation to neglect your future self in the present moment. Conceived by\nbehavioral Katy Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania, temptation\nbundling is a way to blend both future and present self needs by making\nfuture rewards more immediate. You give yourself instant gratification in\nthe present while also achieving goals that benefit your future self in the\nlong-term.\n \nIt’s simpler than it sounds.\n \nBasically, you make a positive (but difficult) behavior or habit in the long-\nterm feel good at the present moment as well. Think eating Twinkies while\nworking out, working out while watching TV, or doing work while soaking\nyour feet in a salt bath—these are examples of ways to make the long-term\nfeel good at the present moment.\n \nThere is no need to suffer in the present to get something done for your\nfuture self; if you do suffer, then you will lose all motivation and\nprocrastinate. So find ways to bundle your temptations with your long-term\ngoals. In other words, pair your obligations with instantaneous rewards.\n \nMilkman found that up to 51% of her study participants were willing to\nexercise with temptation bundling. It is an effective means to correct\n\f\nprocrastination habits. You should make a list with two columns, one side\nbeing your guilty pleasures or temptations and the other side being things\nyou need to do for your future self. Then figure out creative ways to link the\ntwo conflicting columns in harmony.\n \nSuppose you like chocolate, surfing, soccer, and running. But work,\nhomework, and piano lessons stand in your way. How might you combine\nthings to make the unpleasurable more tolerable?\n \nSmall, Easy Increments\n \nAnother way to mitigate procrastination is to start in small, easy increments.\nReally, you want to break tasks down into minuscule, microscopic\ncomponents. This makes your first step seem incredibly easy—and taking\nthat first step is the hardest part with procrastination.\n \nThink of procrastination as an enormous wall you must climb. If you collect\nenough small pebbles and rocks, you can eventually create a step for\nyourself high enough to simply walk over the wall. You can collect boulders\nthe size of your torso, and you may get the same result, but it’s a much\ntougher road.\n \nJust make sure your barriers to starting are extremely low. For example, you\ncan even complete 95% of a task and leave the remaining 5% as a starter\ntask for later, so you can get back in the swing of things easily. Doing this\nbreaks inertia and enables you to gain forward momentum. You gain\nmomentum by working and creating work that you can build off of later as\nyou tackle the harder parts of the project.   \nSmall and easy increments involve two key parts. The first part is to break\nyour tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Don’t view your task as\none huge boulder that you have to get done all at once. Rather, view it as a\nseries of steps to take from Point A to Point B. Your mind will thank you\nfor this as things suddenly seem easier and more doable. An example of this\nis to view the writing project you have ahead of you as a series of\nparagraphs only 100 words long.\n\f\nMaybe you have to write 100 pages, but don’t look at it that way. Look it as\ntaking baby steps with short paragraphs. After you complete so many\nparagraphs, you have written your 100 pages. Small tasks build up rapidly,\nespecially when you are not procrastinating, so create tiny, mentally\npalatable steps that you can take to build something monumental and reach\nyour ultimate goal. A book is composed of words, after all.\n \nThe second part is to start with the easiest tasks first. This may seem\ncounterintuitive. Why would you leave all the hard stuff for later?\nRemember that procrastination is about making the first step as easy as\npossible. You are encouraging yourself and proving to your mind that this\ntask is more than possible with each easy task that you tick off your to-do\nlist. By the time you reach the harder tasks, they will seem more attainable\nand surmountable to your mind since your mind has already done a lot of\nwork.\n \nInertia is the force that builds as you are at rest. On the other hand,\nmomentum is the drive to keep moving forward until you get everything\ndone. Your task here is to break inertia and gain momentum. Small and easy\nincrements accomplish that because nothing else will get you moving more\nquickly.\n \nBack to the writing example: consider how you can do the easy parts, such\nas the outline and the research notes. Write the parts that take the least effort\nfirst. Get the bulk of it done, the easy and simple things that are not hard but\nthat take up a lot of time. Leave the hardest 5% of the writing for last for\nwhen you have momentum. You will not feel so frustrated and\noverwhelmed, and thus you will not consider this writing task a huge\nsacrifice that taxes your present self. You will accomplish it and not suffer,\nwhich offers some pleasure to your present self.\n \nConsider Risks\nA final tactic is to consider what may go wrong. Being hypervigilant about\nwhat may go wrong is a tactic employed by highly successful and\n\f\nproductive people like Bill Gates. Jim Collins explores this tactic in his\nbook Great By Choice. Referring to this as productive paranoia, he\ndiscusses how people like Bill Gates were constantly paranoid about what\nmay go wrong. By always planning for the worst and trying to avoid the\nworst, these people actually ended up working extremely hard. They were\nalways focused on their projects just to avoid the worst possible scenarios.\nAs a result, fear motivated them and kept them from procrastination.\nBe paranoid and start to question what could go wrong. Think about making\ncontingency plans and working to avoid certain challenges or problems.\nThinking about what can go wrong can serve to make you work to avoid\nthings going wrong. As a result, you become more productive just because\nyou are afraid and hypervigilant at the moment.\nBe sure to ask yourself how you might lose out if you delay taking action at\nthis moment. The opportunity may go to someone more proactive. Your\nopportunity may even simply go away, since many things are time-\nsensitive. Consider how disastrous it could be to your success. The fear of\nlosing out will motivate you. Sure, fear is not a pleasant motivator. But if it\nworks, why not use it? Knowing that you are in danger of some kind kicks\nyou into overdrive. Procrastination comes from boredom, complacency, and\nsafety, so stripping those feelings away can leave you paranoid and eager to\navoid bad consequences.\nOf course, fear is not a fun motivator, so only use this tactic in small, safe\ndoses. Doing it too much can really drain you and stress you out. As we all\nknow, stress is damaging to your working spirit. Avoid stress and only use\nthis tactic when you begin to feel an intense temptation to procrastinate.\nOur opening example of Madeleine could have used fear to help her detect\npossible mistakes and thus to motivate herself to write her code each day.\nUsing fear, she would have planned to leave plenty of wiggle room in her\nschedule so that she could properly compile the code and ensure that there\nwere no errors in her code writing. She would have anticipated possible\nerrors and would have worked each day in order to give herself time to\ncatch and fix these errors.\nTakeaways:\n\f\nTackling procrastination is similar to pushing Sisyphus’s stone. You\ncan beat it back for a bit, but it’s so natural that you will never be\nfully rid of it. The problem is typified by time inconsistency, where\nwe comprise two selves that don’t have overlapping desires—one\nwants gratification in the future and the other wants it right now.\nTemptation bundling is an effective method to battle\nprocrastination. It consists of combining your unpleasurable tasks\nwith something pleasurable. This mainly works because you are\nbattling time inconsistency and giving both selves what they want\nsimultaneously.\nStart easy and small. Procrastination thrives off inertia. Therefore,\nyou need to make the path to motion and action as easy as possible.\nThen eventually you can gain momentum—the opposite of inertia.\nSometimes beating procrastination just requires a kick in the pants.\nFear and productive paranoia can do that to you—if you are so\nfearful of the negative repercussions you will face, then you will\ncertainly be spurred into action. But this is not a method to use very\nfrequently."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 6. No Distraction Zone\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is a chapter that promises to kick your butt. It’s full of powerful\ntechniques to ensure that you jump into action. Without further ado, let’s\njump into it.\n \nMinimizing Distractions\n \nWe often think that distractions can be our friends when it comes to self-\ndiscipline. If willpower is finite, then we reason that it’s better to take a\nbreak, refresh, and distract ourselves from urges and temptations.\n \nBaba Shiv, a professor of marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of\nBusiness, conducted a study that illustrates how distractions affect us. Shiv\ndistracted one group of participants by asking them to remember a phone\nnumber and then asked all the study participants to choose either chocolate\ncake or fruit. Those who were trying to remember phone numbers chose the\ncake 50% more often than those who weren’t. The conclusion here is that\nfocus is an essential part of being disciplined.\n \nIf you’re constantly distracted, you succumb to temptations without even\ngiving yourself a chance to exercise your willpower. It just doesn’t occur to\nyou, and you choose the path of least resistance despite your best intentions.\nDistractions sneakily eat away at our self-discipline. This process can go on\nin the background so that we don’t even realize that our discipline is lapsing\nuntil it’s too late and all of our past efforts have been wasted.\n\f\nThe design of checkout lanes in supermarkets is a prime example of\ncapitalizing on distracted minds and depleted willpower. You can make\nhealthy decisions every step of the way through the grocery store, but you\ncan’t escape without one final distraction of candy, chocolate, and snacks at\nthe register. This is frequently the most difficult time to be disciplined\nbecause you’re so close to exiting and thinking ahead and the items are\ncheap and available to purchase instantly.\n \nWhat should you do with this knowledge? If you work in a cluttered\nenvironment, clean it up. A clean desk can help create a clear mind, and a\nclear mind is much more able to remain disciplined. A Cornell University\nstudy provides some compelling evidence supporting the concept of “out of\nsight, out of mind” as a means of improving discipline, and it applies to far\nmore beyond your desk.\n \nThe study participants were given a jar full of Hershey’s Kisses that was\neither clear or opaque and either placed on their desk or six feet away. On\naverage, the participants ate 7.7 Kisses per day from the clear jars on their\ndesks as opposed to 4.6 per day from opaque jars in the same location.\nWhen the jars were placed six feet away, the participants ate 5.6 Kisses per\nday from the clear jars and 3.1 per day from the opaque jars.\n \nSurprisingly, the study subjects consistently reported feeling that they had\neaten more Kisses when the jars were placed six feet away, even though the\nopposite was true. That discrepancy is a crucial piece of information\nbecause it provides a simple guideline for improving discipline. That is, you\ncan use laziness to your advantage by clearing your workplace of\ndistractions. You may not completely forget about those distractions, but the\nmore effort it takes for you to give in to a temptation, the less likely you are\nto do so. Furthermore, it eliminates some of the most counterproductive\ndiscipline lapses—the mindless ones that we don’t even realize we are\ndoing.\n \nIt’s so much easier to reach your hand into a cookie jar without thinking\nabout it if that jar is easily accessible and visible. Those are the types of\n\f\nscenarios that you want to avoid when designing an environment for\ndiscipline. If you place the cookie jar in a distant cabinet, you don’t\neliminate the temptation altogether but you make it so that giving in to the\ntemptation requires a lot of effort. That makes a big difference.\n \nUltimately, you want to create an environment for yourself that is clear of\ndistractions and obvious temptations. You can make discipline drastically\neasier just by eliminating the mindless and effortless lapses in discipline\nthat are made possible by an environment that hasn’t been optimized. This\napplies to your desk, your workspace, your office, what you can see from\nyour desk, and even your computer desktop. Keep them clear of distractions\nas much as possible and you’ll simply forget about them. In your lapses of\ndiscipline or boredom, you’ll have no other option than to keep working.\n \nDefault to Positive Actions and Behaviors\n \nOptimizing your environment for self-discipline really comes down to\nunderstanding how automatic most of your decision-making is.\n \nTo illustrate that point, consider the findings of a study conducted in 11\nEuropean countries on organ donors. The data showed that countries that\nautomatically have citizens opted-in to being organ donors—requiring\naction to opt-out—had rates at or above 95% participation. When the\ndefault choice was not to be an organ donor, however, the highest rate found\nin any of the 11 countries was a mere 27% participation. Ultimately, people\njust went with the option that required the least effort. It said nothing about\ntheir actual intention or desire to be an organ donor.\n \nThis same concept of defaulting to the more desirable choice can be applied\nto your own self-discipline. We’re lazy and will happily accept whatever is\nin front of our faces. You can make it easy for yourself to choose whichever\noptions most benefit you while also making it as difficult as possible to\nmake harmful decisions.\n \nA default option is one that the decision-maker chooses if he or she does\nnothing or the minimal amount of effort. In other contexts, default options\n\f\nalso include those that are normative or suggested. Countless experiments\nand observational studies have shown that making an option the default will\nincrease the likelihood of it being chosen, which is known as the default\neffect. Making decisions requires energy, so we often choose the default\noption to conserve energy and avoid making decisions, especially when we\naren’t familiar with what it is we are making a decision about.\n \nOptimizing these default decisions is where the bulk of your efforts to make\na more discipline-conducive environment can take place. You might believe\nthat you control the majority of your choices, but in reality, that isn’t the\ncase. Instead, a significant amount of your actions are just responses to your\nenvironment.\n \nIf you’re distracted by social media, for example, you might move the app\nicons to the back page of your phone so that you aren’t constantly seeing\nthem whenever you open your phone to do something else. Better yet, you\ncan log out of the apps after each use or delete them from your phone\naltogether so that you’ll only use them when you really want to instead of\nletting them be distractions.\n \nAnd if you’re in the habit of mindlessly picking up your phone while\nworking, you can simply start placing it faced down and far enough away\nthat you have to get up to reach it. If you want to practice violin more, put it\non your desk with your music notes open. If you want to floss your teeth\nmore, keep floss in your backpack, in your bathroom, on your nightstand,\nand on your sofa.\n \nThere is a seemingly endless number of examples of how you can utilize\nthe default effect to become more disciplined with very little use of\nwillpower itself. Another one is that leaving potato chips and cookies out on\nthe kitchen counter will make it your default choice to eat those things\nwhenever you walk to the kitchen feeling even the slightest bit hungry.\nHiding those (or not buying them at all) and replacing those unhealthy\nsnacks with fruit will instantly increase the probability that you eat fruit and\nthat you avoid the unhealthy snacks. Want to exercise more? Put a pull-up\nbar in your bathroom doorway.\n\f\nIf you keep sugary sodas and juices in your refrigerator, you’re making it\nyour default choice to drink them whenever you are thirsty and open the\nfridge. But if you don’t have those options, you increase the likelihood that\nyou’ll drink water or make tea. Want to take more vitamins? Put them right\nnext to your toothbrush for easier access.\n \nIf you sit in an office all day and have back problems, then you might\nbenefit from standing up and walking frequently throughout the day. You\ncan make this your default option by drinking water constantly so that you\nare forced to get up to go to the bathroom. Or perhaps you could schedule\nalarms on your phone and place it somewhere out of reach so that you have\nto stand up to turn off the alarm whenever it goes off.\n \nThe whole point of this is that you can save your willpower and your energy\nby making positive changes to your environment. The two biggest facets of\nenvironmental change are reducing clutter and distractions and optimizing\nchoices based on the default effect.\n \nIf you reduce distractions from your environment, you’ll clear your mind,\nwhich in turn increases focus, efficiency, and productivity. Furthermore,\nyou can use your dopamine reward system to your advantage by reinforcing\nyour own good habits while also cutting back on mindless pursuits of small\npleasures. Finally, you can make it so the path with the least effort leads to\nthe choices you desire and benefit from.\n \nThese all make it so you can sidestep actually using discipline and to save it\nfor your bigger daily challenges. After all, why exercise willpower when\nyou don’t need to if you can plan around it?\n \nAttention Residue\n \nSometimes focusing on work can be difficult, and you find yourself\nwondering just why it’s so hard to stay on track and ignore shiny objects.\nLuckily, there is an explanation for this. In 2009, Sophie Leroy published a\n\f\npaper that was aptly titled “Why Is It So Hard to Do My Work?” In it, she\nexplained an effect that she called attention residue.\n \nLeroy noted that other researchers had studied the effect of multitasking on\nperformance but that in the modern work environment, once you reached a\nhigh enough level, it was more common to find people working on multiple\nprojects sequentially. “Going from one meeting to the next, starting to work\non one project and soon after having to transition to another is just part of\nlife in organizations,” Leroy explains.\n \nThis is essentially the modern version of multitasking—working on projects\nin short bursts and switching between them, not necessarily doing them all\nat once. People may not actually be working on multiple tasks at the same\ntime, but it’s nearly as bad to keep switching between them in relatively\nquick succession. For all intents and purposes, this is multitasking.\n \nThe problem identified by this research is that you cannot switch seamlessly\nbetween tasks without a delay of sorts. When you switch from Task A to\nTask B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your\nattention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This becomes\nworse and the residue becomes especially “thick” if your work on Task A\nwas unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you\nfinish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.\n \nLeroy’s tests forced people to switch between different tasks in a laboratory\nsetting. In one of these experiments, she started the subjects working on a\nset of word puzzles. In one of the trials, she would interrupt their work and\nforce them to move on to a new and challenging task—for example, reading\nresumes and making hypothetical hiring decisions. In other trials, she let the\nsubjects finish the puzzles before giving them the next task.\n \nWhile the participants were switching between puzzling and hiring, Leroy\nwould play a quick lexical decision game. This was so she could quantify\nthe amount of leftover residue from the first task. The results were clear:\n“People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to\n\f\ndemonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the\nresidue, the worse the performance.\n \nThis doesn’t seem too far of a stretch when you think about it. We’ve all\nexperienced that frantic moment when we’re doing too many things at once\nand suddenly find ourselves unable to do any at all. How can you\nconcentrate on any task if you keep switching back and forth between two\nor more different things? You’ll likely be stuck simply trying to make sense\nof everything and organize it so you can understand it. It will only force you\nto waste time trying to catch up to where you were instead of pushing\nforward. You’ll take one step forward but two steps back each time you try.\n \nEven worse news is presented by a Stanford researcher, Clifford Nass, who\nexamined the work pattern of people who multitask. The researchers split\ntheir subjects into two groups: those who regularly do a lot of media\nmultitasking and those who don’t. In one experiment, the groups were\nshown sets of two red rectangles alone or surrounded by two, four, or six\nblue rectangles. Each configuration was flashed twice, and the participants\nhad to determine whether the two red rectangles in the second frame\ndiffered from the first.\n \nIt sounds simple enough: just ignore the blue rectangles and see if the red\nones change. In fact, it was quite simple, and those who didn’t often\nmultitask had no trouble doing this. However, the high multitaskers\nperformed terribly as they were constantly distracted by the irrelevant blue\nimages.\n \nBecause they couldn’t ignore the images, the researchers thought that\nmaybe they were better at storing and organizing information. Maybe they\nhad better memories. But this was proven wrong by the second test. After\nbeing shown sequences of alphabetical letters, the high multitaskers also\nstruggled to remember when a letter was making a repeat appearance. And\nagain, the low multitaskers performed better overall. It was as simple as\nthat.\n\f\n“The low multitaskers did great,” Ophir said. “The high multitaskers were\ndoing worse and worse the further they went along because they kept seeing\nmore letters and had difficulty keeping them sorted in their brains.”\n \nMultitasking may seem to be the best of both worlds, but when you’re in\nsituations where there are multiple sources of information coming from the\nexternal world or emerging from memory, you cannot filter out what is\nirrelevant to your current goal. This failure to filter means that you are\nslowed down by irrelevant information and will struggle to complete a task\nwithout distractions. It is much easier to focus on one thing at once, without\nletting distractions interfere, than to try doing several things at a time and\noverload your brain with too much information.\n \nFrom both of these experiments, it’s clear that multitasking isn’t really good\nfor anything, and all attempts to do it don’t really lead anywhere. By\nmultitasking you are neither able to adequately focus on each new task nor\nable to ignore any distractions that are hindering your work. There might be\ncertain ways you can multitask 1% more effectively, but the overall lesson\nis just to avoid it whenever possible.\n \nSingletasking. What does this mean?\n \nTo set everything else aside and not check, monitor, email, or even touch\nanything other than the current task you are working on. It requires singular\nfocus and the purposeful and intentional tuning out of everything else.\nSwitch off your notifications and ditch your phone. If you must be on your\ncomputer, keep only one browser tab or program open at a time. A lot of\nsingletasking is about consciously avoiding distractions that seem small and\nharmless. The biggest culprits? Your electronic devices. Ignore them when\npossible.\n \nKeep a spotless workspace so your eye doesn’t catch something that needs\ncleaning or adjusting. Ideally, singletasking reduces your environment to a\nblank room because you shouldn’t pay attention to any of it.\n\f\nAttempt to pay attention to when you are being interrupted or subtly\nswitching between tasks. This is hard to catch at first and will require you to\nmake conscious decisions against your instincts.\n \nSomething that will be very hard to resist is to tell yourself that you must\nact on something immediately and interrupt your task. This is rarely the\ntruth. To combat this urge, set aside a Post-it to take notes for ideas that will\ninevitably spring to mind regarding other tasks. Just jot them down quickly\nand return to your primary goal. You can address them after your\nsingletasking period is over, and you won’t have forgotten anything. It will\nkeep your mind focused on one single task while setting you up for future\nsuccess.\nBatching\nHenry Ford, founder of Ford Motor Company, got a lot of things right about\ncars.\n \nHe had a few competitors back in the day, but a primary reason those names\nare essentially lost in time is because he was also the creator of the factory\nassembly line. On a factory assembly line, workers focus on one task at a\ntime.\n \nThis streamlines a process and makes it far more efficient than having a\nsingle worker see a project through from start to finish, switching between\nmultiple tasks. It allows workers to specialize and perfect their task, which\ncuts down on errors and makes troubleshooting far easier. Workers didn’t\nhave to do more thinking than was necessary for the task at hand. For Ford,\nthis made his automobile production efficiency and output shoot through\nthe roof and dominate his market.\n \nThat, in essence, is what batching can do for you.\n \nBatching is when you group similar tasks together to complete them all at\nonce. Ford’s assembly line was essentially 100% batching because his\nworkers only performed one task incredibly efficiently.\n\f\nLet’s take a common example we can all relate to—checking email.\n \nIf you have any sort of online presence or job, you probably have a steady\nstream of emails trickling (or gushing) into your inbox every hour.\nConstantly checking your email is an extremely inefficient use of time. It\ninterrupts other tasks and scatters your focus whenever you receive a new\nemail. Many of us drop what we’re doing to take care of something from an\nemail. Then we have to start the original task over again because our flow\nand momentum has been interrupted.\n \nBatching emails will considerably improve your productivity. An example\nof this would be to only check your emails at the top of every two hours and\npurposely ignore or block your inbox notifications. At first it might be\ndifficult, but limiting how often you check email in this way allows you to\nfocus on your tasks without constantly being distracted and having to re-\nacclimatize yourself.\n \nPerhaps more importantly, it teaches the lesson that saying no to some tasks\nis just as important as saying yes to the correct ones. Batching teaches the\nart of purposeful, deliberate ignorance so you can focus on other tasks.\n \nSwitching from task to task is a large mental burden because you are\nessentially stopping and starting from zero numerous times throughout the\nday. It takes a lot of energy to switch from task to task, and there are usually\na few wasted minutes just regaining your bearings and figuring out the\nstatus of the task you were working on. Of course, these kinds of\ninterruptions only lead to achieving just a portion of what you can and want\nto.\n \nIn the example of checking email, batching allows you to stay in a mindset\nof reading and composing email with all its associated skills, tasks, and\nreminders. Email is a distinctly different mindset and way of thinking than\ndesigning a new graphic for an advertising campaign. Staying in the same\nmindset pays huge dividends.\n\f\nBatching allows you to save your mental energy for the tasks themselves\nand not waste your energy on the process of switching back and forth\nbetween them.\n \nWhat else can you batch? You can schedule all your meetings in one\nafternoon so you will have a free, uninterrupted morning to work. You can\nplan to do everything that requires computer access in the morning and\neven batch parts of tasks such as the parts that require you to make phone\ncalls.\n \nYou can also batch your distractions. This isn’t to distract and amuse\nyourself more efficiently; it’s to make sure that you are conserving your\nenergy and allowing your focused time to be exactly that—focused.\n \nHow can you batch distractions? For example, if you’re burned out on a\nparticular task, you might want to take a little social media break. By all\nmeans, take it! However, allot just a bit more time to check all of your\naccounts: ESPN, Refinery29, and whatever other distractions you occupy\nyourself with. Grab a new cup of coffee, take a brisk walk around the office,\nand say hello to your neighbor.\n \nGet it all out of your system so that when you’re back to work, you can\nhave a solid and fixed block of time in which to focus. After all, if there is\nnothing new on your Facebook page, you will probably feel less compelled\nto check it. Once you knock yourself out doing all these distracting\nactivities within the allotted time, you can switch to productive work for the\nrest of your hour.\n \nThe more you divide your attention among different activities, the less\nproductive you’ll be. However, if you begin doing something similar to the\nprevious activity, you’ll find it’s much easier to get going because your\nmind is already geared toward doing a certain kind of task. Do all the\nsimilar tasks together, one after the other, and then move on to the next\nbatch of similar or related activities. Effective batching can skyrocket your\nproductivity no matter the context.\n\f\n“Don’t-Do” List\n \nEveryone knows the value of the to-do list—no doubt you’ve stumbled\nacross tips elsewhere about using a to-do list to increase productivity.\n \nBut everyone inherently kind of knows what they should be doing and when\nthey need to do it by. The act of writing it down just helps remind them, and\nit makes people more likely to take care of their obligations.\n \nHowever, not everyone knows what they shouldn’t be doing—what they\nshould be avoiding, common ways of procrastinating, and distractions that\nmasquerade as priorities. Along with your to-do list, it’s equally important\nto make a don’t-do list. Each day, we’re faced with choosing tasks that will\ncreate the biggest impact for us, and there are many hidden obstacles.\n \nAgain, we all know the obvious evils to avoid when trying to upgrade\nproductivity: social media, goofing around on the Internet, watching The\nBachelorette while trying to work, and learning to play the flute while\nreading.\n \nIt can be difficult to distinguish between real tasks and useless tasks, and it\nwill require some hard thought on your part. You need to fill your don’t-do\nlist with tasks that will sneakily steal your time and undermine your goals.\nThese are tasks that are insignificant or a poor use of your time, tasks that\ndon’t help your bottom line, and tasks that have a serious case of\ndiminishing returns the more you work on them.\n \nIf you continuously devote and waste your time on these tasks, your real\npriorities and goals will be left untouched. Here’s what you should put on\nyour don’t-do list.\n \nFirst, include tasks that are priorities but which you can’t do anything about\nat present because of external circumstances.\n \nThese are tasks that are important in one or many ways but are waiting for\nfeedback from others or for underlying tasks to be completed first. Put these\n\f\non your don’t-do list because there is literally nothing you can do about\nthem!\n \nDon’t spend your mental energy thinking about them. They’ll still be there\nwhen you hear back from those other people. Just note that you are waiting\nto hear back from someone else and note the date on which you need to\nfollow-up if you haven’t heard back. Then push these out of your mind\nbecause they’re on someone else’s to-do list, not yours. You can also\ntemporarily push things off your plate by clarifying and asking questions of\nother people. This puts the ball in their court to act, and you can take that\ntime to catch up on other matters.\n \nSecond, include tasks that don’t add value as far as your projects are\nconcerned.\n \nThere are many small items that don’t add to your bottom line, and often\nthese are trivial things—busy work. Can you delegate these, assign them to\nsomeone else, or even outsource them? Do they really require your time? In\nother words, are they worth your time? And will anyone but you notice the\ndifference if you delegate the task to someone else? By taking on the task\nyourself, are you getting stuck in the weeds of perfectionism? You should\nspend your time on big tasks that move entire projects forward and not\nmyopic, trivial tasks. Often these are useless tasks disguised as important\nones, such as selecting the paint color for the bike shed in the parking lot of\nthe nuclear power plant you are building.\n \nThird, include tasks that are current and ongoing but will not benefit from\nadditional work or attention paid to them.\n \nThese tasks suffer from diminishing returns. These tasks are just a waste of\nenergy because while they can still stand to improve (and is there anything\nthat can’t?), the amount of likely improvement will either not make a\ndifference in the overall outcome or success or will take a disproportionate\namount of time and effort without making a significant dent."

    "raw_text": "For all intents and purposes, these tasks should be considered done. Don’t\nwaste your time on them, and don’t fall into the trap of considering them a\npriority. Once you finish everything else on your plate, you can then\nevaluate how much time you want to devote to polishing something.\n \nIf the task is at 90% of the quality you need it to be, it’s time to look around\nat what else needs your attention to bring it from 0% to 90%. In other\nwords, it’s far more helpful to have three tasks completed at 80% quality\nversus one task at 100% quality.\n \nWhen you consciously avoid the items on your don’t-do list, you keep\nyourself focused and streamlined. You don’t waste energy or time, and your\ndaily output will increase dramatically.\n \nWhy read a menu with food items that are unavailable? It’s pointless and\nwastes your mental bandwidth. By preventing your energy level from being\ndissipated by those things that suck up your time and attention, a don’t-do\nlist enables you to focus on what matters.\n \nThis can have a very dramatic and positive impact on your daily routine.\nThe fewer things that tug on your mind, the better—the kind of stress and\nanxiety they create only hampers or kills productivity. A don’t-do list will\nfree your mind from the burden of having too many things in the air\nbecause it eliminates most of those things! You can focus on the balls that\nare still in flight and steadily knock each one out.\n \nThe 40–70 Rule\nMany of us are reluctant to take actions outside the comfort zone unless we\nhave all the pertinent information we need. But can you actually have too\nmuch information to start something new?\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has a rule of thumb about\nmaking decisions and coming to a point of action. He says that any time\nyou face a hard choice, you should have no less than 40% and no more than\n70% of the information you need to make that decision. In that range, you\nhave enough information to make an informed choice but not so much"

    "raw_text": "intelligence that you lose your resolve and simply stay abreast of the\nsituation.\nIf you have less than 40% of the information you need, you’re essentially\nshooting from the hip. You don’t know quite enough to move forward and\nwill probably make a lot of mistakes. Conversely, if you chase down more\ndata until you get more than 70% of what you need (and it’s unlikely that\nyou’ll truly need anything above this level), you could get overwhelmed\nand uncertain. The opportunity may have passed you by and someone else\nmay have beaten you by starting already.\nBut in that sweet spot between 40% and 70%, you have enough to go on\nand let your intuition guide your decisions. In the context of Colin Powell,\nthis is where effective leaders are made: the ones who have instincts that\npoint in the right direction are who will lead their organization to success.\nFor our purposes of breaking out of the comfort zone, we can replace the\nword “information” with other motivators: 40–70% of experience, 40–70%\nreading or learning, 40–70% confidence, or 40–70% of planning. While\nwe’re completing the task, we’ll also be doing analyzing and planning on\nthe fly, so this range of certainty helps us tend toward action.\nWhen you try to achieve more than 70% information (or confidence,\nexperience, etc.), your lack of speed can result in many negative\nconsequences. It can also destroy your momentum or stem your interest,\neffectively meaning nothing’s going to happen. There is a high likelihood of\ngaining nothing further from surpassing this threshold.\nFor example, let’s say you’re opening up a cocktail bar, which involves\nbuying a lot of different types of liquor. You can’t expect to have absolutely\nall the liquor you will ever need ready when the doors are ready to open.\nBut on the other hand, it doesn’t make sense to commence operations\nwithout enough for customers to choose from.\nSo you’d wait until you have at least 40% of available inventory. You’ve\ngot momentum established. You figure if you could get more than half of\nwhat you need, you’ll be in pretty good shape to open. You might not be\nable to make absolutely every drink in the bartender’s guide, but you’ll\nhave enough on-hand to cover the staple drinks with a couple of variations.\n\f\nIf you have around 50–60% inventory, you’re probably ready. When the\nremaining inventory arrives, you’ll already be in action and can just\nincorporate that new inventory into your offerings. If you waited until you\nhad 70% or more inventory, you could find yourself stuck in neutral for\nlonger than you wanted to be.\nThis way of thinking leads to more action than not. Waiting until you have\n40% of what you need to make a move isn’t a sedentary stay inside your\ncomfort zone—you’re actively planning what you need to do to get out,\nwhich is just fine (as long as it’s not overplanning). Making the execution\nbefore you’re 100%—or even halfway—ready to do so is the kind of gutsy\nmove that shakes you out of the indifference of your comfort zone in a\nhurry.\n \nDo Nothing\n \nBurn-out is a very real risk, especially in today’s modern age where to get\nahead, it seems that everyone has a full-time job as well as a side career that\nis aimed toward making money. We seek to intentionally pack our days full\nof activities, professional and social, as a means of squeezing the last drop\nof enjoyment out of our lives.\n \nIronically, this quickly becomes counterproductive because very few people\nhave a battery that can function like that. As for what that means for your\nbrain, any shred of fatigue will affect your clarity of thought. That part\nshould be clear from our own lives. We function better on eight hours of\nsleep versus three hours of sleep.\n \nHowever, what’s less obvious is that disconnecting from everything and\ndoing nothing at all can actually be a path to greater creativity and insight.\nThere’s a reason that when we are zoning out at the gym or in the shower,\nwe seem to have a disproportionate number of epiphanies. Thought is\ninherently fatiguing and taxing on the mind and is characterized by the\nbrain emitting beta waves. Relaxation and a lack of attention, on the other\nhand, is characterized by the brain emitting alpha waves."

    "raw_text": "What are alpha waves also associated with? Studies by Professor Flavio\nFrohlich, among others, have shown that alpha waves are associated with\nenhanced memory, creative thinking, and overall increased happiness.\n \nMaybe that’s the reason meditation and practicing mindfulness is being\npushed so hard these days. They intentionally slow you down and put you\ninto a state of releasing alpha waves, which trigger increased happiness and\nlife satisfaction. Most of the world’s top performers, such as CEOs, always\nmention meditation as a vital part of their daily routine—this is likely why.\nThe ability to tune things out allows them to function at their peak when it\nmatters, like a battery recharge in the middle of the day.\n \nFor the high achievers out there, it’s not necessarily a matter of taking a\nbreak just to generate some alpha waves. Don’t think of it as rest; think of it\nas recovering so you can get ready when you need to really think creatively.\n \nWe instinctively know to sleep, stretch, and warm up our bodies if we have\nan athletic competition, but we disregard doing the same for our minds.\nWhen you relax more and do nothing at all, you enter a state of allowing\nyour mind to wander, and you also come back recharged and refreshed.\n \nAllow yourself to daydream because when was the last time your\ndaydreams were boring and routine versus creative and outlandish? If you\nneed a break, resist the urge to pick up your phone and scroll through your\nsocial media. Just staring into blank space might be a better use of your\ntime!\n \nTakeaways:\n \nMinimize your distractions in your environment. It turns out that\nout of sight is out of mind with distractions, so don’t keep anything\nstimulating near your workstation otherwise your willpower will\nslowly deplete itself.\nCreate default actions wherever possible. This is where the easiest\nand lowest resistance past for you is the path you want the most.\n\f\nThis is also done through curating and designing your environment\nfor productivity.\nSingletasking is an important concept because it definitively proves\nthe flaws of multitasking. When you switch from task to task, you\ncreate attention residue. This means it takes a while for you to\nadjust to each new task, even if you were already familiar with it.\nYou can eliminate this by singletasking, and also by batching,\nwhich is when you do all similar types of tasks together to\ncapitalize on your mental efficiency.\nA don’t-do list can be just as powerful as a to-do list because we are\nrarely told what to ignore. As a result, these distractions or sneaky\ntime-suckers can invade our space without us even knowing we are\nbeing duped. Include tasks you can’t move forward on, make\nprogress on, or help.\nThe 40–70 rule is when you beat inaction through the amount of\ninformation you seek. If you have less than 40%, don’t act. But if\nyou have 70%, you must act. You’ll never have 100%, and chances\nare, 70% is more than sufficient—the rest you learn along the way,\nanyway.\nFinally, you might want to do nothing from time to time. This is rest\nand relaxation—but you should think of it as mental recovery. What\ndoes an athlete do between races or matches? You got it—they\nrecover so they are primed to work again when necessary."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 7: Deadly Pitfalls\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the science of following through, there are a massive number of mistakes\nthat you could make that could cost you your progress.\n \nTake Michael. Michael is only human. Thus, he made some mistakes with\nfollow-through when he first started his at-home freelance consulting firm.\nHe believed that starting his business would change his life overnight. He\nimagined getting tons of money for minimal work, having plenty of time to\nplay with his newborn daughter, and even having time to hit the gym and\nget pumped like Arnold. He imagined that having no boss would free up a\nlot of his time.\n \nWeeks went by and he did none of those things. In fact, his expectations felt\nso extreme that they were intimidating and discouraging.\n \nThis is called false hope syndrome. Michael thought he would accomplish a\nlot more than was humanly possible. His other mistake was not getting to\nknow himself or how he worked best. He tried to impose an unrealistic\nschedule on himself that just did not fit his natural circadian rhythm and\nwork preferences.\n \nFalse hope syndrome occurs when you think that you can do everything on\nyour to-do list and reach your dreams in a short amount of time. You\npromise yourself, or a client, the moon. Then you are sorely disappointed\nwhen you cannot deliver, and those big expectations have actually caused a\n\f\nnegative effect on your working spirit. They’ll cause you to shrink back and\nbe more fearful of the failure you just experienced, and you may end up in a\nworse state than you were to begin with.\n \nMichael was extremely disappointed by the lack of huge life changes he\nsaw when he started his business. His life did not change magically\novernight. He did not have the energy for all of these changes he was\nplanning to make. Plus, he hated working because he was following the\nwrong schedule. He began to fall behind on work and procrastinate to avoid\nthe tasks he hated. He tried to work in the morning while drinking three\ncups of coffee and found he just could not function.\n \nAfter a while, Michael decided to take a good long look at what he was\ntrying to do and how he was failing. He adjusted his schedule to fit his\nlifestyle better and stopped working so early in the morning after staying up\nlate with his daughter, who had not yet achieved a normal sleep cycle. He\nfound how to work on only a few goals at a time and make time for his\ngoals when he could.\n \nSuddenly, Michael felt better and worked better. Life was just easier since\nhe fell into a more comfortable and realistic groove. He was no longer so\noverwhelmed and disappointed, so he stopped despising work and stopped\nputting work off out of loathing and dread.\n \nLike Michael, we all make mistakes. But learning which mistakes to avoid\ngives you a step up on other people. You will not tax your self-discipline or\nwillpower for follow-through if you avoid these common mistakes.\n \nFalse Hope Syndrome\n \nFalse hope syndrome, what Michael had, is where you overestimate the\nchanges you can make. You set unrealistic expectations for what you can do\nand the speed, number, and ease of the changes you plan to make to your\nlife. When you can’t accomplish everything on your list of desired changes,\nthe disappointment at failing to reach your lofty goals can cause a powerful\nbacklash that will cause you to give up hope.\n\f\nEven if you have extremely strong self-discipline and desire to change, you\nwill still fail if your expectations are too high. Plan for proper expectations\nand figure out what you can actually hope for. Learn to let go of hopes that\nare not realistic and to set expectations that you can actually obtain or meet.\nOne example of this might be thinking that you will magically be able to\nchange your work habits, even though you have tried doing the same things\nin the past and have failed. You expect to get more done with distractions\nand multitasking, for example, even though that has never worked for you\nbefore. Changing your approach and not believing that you can initiate too\nmuch self-change is essential to being successful because it prevents you\nfrom falling into old habits and disappointing yourself.\n \nFalse hope is about controlling your expectations. When you can have\nrealistic hopes, you can actually achieve, which leads to confidence,\ncompetence, and skill. Anything else is just setting yourself up for\nheartbreak and failure, which tends to not be productive. Don’t shoot too\nhigh, but don’t shoot too low; otherwise, you’ll grow bored and unengaged.\nJust remember that your goals can be entirely different from your\nexpectations.\nOverthinking\nAnother mistake is overthinking. Overthinking is a silent killer of joy, hope,\nand reason. It kills your positivity and desire to carry on. Overthinking\nmakes you inevitably fixate on the negative because they are so easy to\nfind, and your entire worldview eventually goes dark.\nOverthinking is so tempting because it mimics progress. After all, you are\nthinking about work and doing research to make the best decision. You\nthink you are being proactive. But really, overthinking is silently hampering\nyou and this is another classic instance of mere motion versus actual action.\nYou are considering too many options and doing too much research, which\nlimits your ability to make an executive decision. You are wasting time\ndoing research and forming plans for things that don’t really matter instead\nof putting one foot in front of the other and eliminating your inertia.\nBy overthinking, you freeze your ability to make decisions. Psychologist\nBarry Schwartz suggests that a paradox of choice is harmful because it\n\f\nleads to analysis paralysis. His studies reveal that having more choices\nactually causes people to develop anxiety and avoid making a choice in the\nlong run. Having fewer present choices helps people narrow it down.\nConsider when you go to Walmart and you are faced with buying a new\nprinter for your office. Standing before the wall of printers, all of which\nhave great advertising and boast so many features, you find yourself\noverwhelmed and can’t settle on a printer. You panic and buy the first one\nyou see. (Or you go home without buying one even though you needed it.)\nYou wasted so much time deliberating over printers and you ended up not\neven using the information you gained because you got overwhelmed. You\ncan’t decide because there is too much information overloading your brain\nin the process. This is a perfect illustration of how overthinking kills your\nability to follow through and execute.\nSo instead of overthinking, place an emphasis on action. Most actions are\nreversible—you can easily return a printer to Walmart. But you’ll have\ngained no further information if you stay in the same place without moving.\nYou can also limit the choices you give yourself and the criterion you use.\nFocus on the main things you need, and find the easiest choice that meets\nyour needs. Don’t fall down the rabbit hole of researching obsessively on\nGoogle or comparing thousands of brands to find the best one. Chances are,\n90% of them do exactly what you want with little variance. So what are you\nreally deliberating over?\nIf you are tasked with buying the new office printer, determine three traits\nyour office needs in a printer. Then go to Walmart and buy the cheapest one\nthat meets all of those needs. Put blinders on such that nothing else matters.\nThis is a classic example of limiting your information intake and being\nwillfully ignorant. Overthinking can sneak in because we don’t have clarity\non what matters, so when you can articulate those, suddenly you can see\nclear choices.\nWorry\nWorry is closely related to overthinking and it is the third powerful mistake\nyou might make in following through.\nWorrying is when you ruminate on problems, real or imagined. This takes\nyou out of the present, which you have control over, and puts you into the"

    "raw_text": "future or past, which you have zero control over.\nWorrying steals your control and composure, but taking action and focusing\non the present empowers you by letting you get things done now. Try to\nswitch your mindset toward action and solutions rather than problems and\nmistakes. Furthermore, worrying makes you focus on things that may not\neven be real and that you cannot change, and you devote time and energy to\nthese worries that you could be spending on work instead.\nIt’s a tall task to tell someone to worry less. But the truth is, worrying\ncauses you to suffer twice—once during the worrying and again if the\ndreaded event actually occurs. And if it doesn’t occur, you’ve just suffered\nfor no reason at all.\nWorrying can also masquerade as productivity, but again, it is wasted\nmotion. It’s a lot of energy spent to get nowhere. Focus on what you can\ncontrol and do something about. Focus on things that are real and have\nhappened, not imaginary outcomes or scenarios that may never come to\npass. Do what you can do at the moment, because that’s all you can control;\nin doing so, carry a mindset of action and control rather than fear.\nKnow Thyself\nThe final major mistake many people make is failing to get to know\nthemselves. Knowing yourself enables you to figure out how to work best\nand create the most beneficial environments for yourself.\nNot all people work the same way. One man might like a detailed schedule\nthat lays out every part of his day, while another man needs breathing room\nand spontaneity. One woman may need a quiet environment where she can\nwork alone while another woman needs friends and a social work\nenvironment to thrive in.\nLike Michael found out, don’t impose unrealistic or unsuitable schedules,\nideals, or environments on yourself and expect to succeed. Find what is best\nfor you and then implement that to thrive. You can only work best if you are\nin your best environment. Find what that environment is instead of forcing\nyourself to conform to something that does not suit you and instead makes\nyou miserable and hinders your productivity.\nWhen you use your preferences and strengths to your advantage, you are\nmore likely to follow through. This is because you are allowing yourself to\n\f\nwork at your best, at your very peak. You’re not fighting yourself and are\ninstead working within your flow and accessing your strengths. You are not\nmaking yourself miserable by following someone else’s formula for\nsuccess.\nStop judging yourself and others for being different. We are all different.\nOur productivity is very fragile and requires particular care to flourish.\nTreat yourself to what helps you thrive if you want to follow through.\nFigure out what times you work best during the day. Then work during\nthose times. Don’t let others judge you for not being functional before 8:00\na.m. or for working late into the night. Working at your best time will\nenable you to be more productive and follow through more easily because\nyou are using your energy when you have the most of it. Don’t try to work\nearly in the morning if you are not a morning person because that will only\nlead you to failure.\nThere is another component to getting to know yourself: diagnosing why\nyou are failing and fixing the underlying problem. It is diagnosing the cause\nand source of your lack of follow-through so that you can address it. Only\nwhen you determine the cause of your poor follow-through can you actually\ndo something about it. Don’t make the common mistake of attributing\nfailure to the wrong cause, or you will never be able to address and correct\nthe issue.\nBe Sherlock Holmes if you are having trouble with follow-through. Using\nthe power of deduction, deduce what is wrong and why you are not being\nproductive. Maybe you are reading another time management book when\nyou should be keeping a calendar and not wasting time on books. Maybe\nyou are trying to organize and label everything when really you just have\ntoo much stuff and need to get rid of some of it. Maybe you are discouraged\nso you procrastinate and thus keep failing and wondering why your\ndiscouragement is growing.\nReally consider how you feel when you don’t follow through. Look at your\nfeelings during the commencement stage of a project and see if you feel\noverwhelmed or put things off for too long to reasonably finish them. Why\ndo you specifically give up? When you find the reason, you can figure out\nhow to apply one of the rules or mindsets in this book to rectify the\nproblem."

    "raw_text": "Failure happens, and it’s going to happen. It’s not the end of the world. It’s\ncertainly not the end of productivity. But failure is useful only when we’re\naware of the cause. When we see the cause, we can see how to fix it and\nhow to avoid repeated failure in the future. When we don’t, we’re doomed\nto repeat our mistakes until we do realize what’s actually going on. Avoid\nwasted time by diagnosing your reasons for failure early on.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nPitfalls to following through and finishing what you start? Too\nmany to name. But a select few in this chapter are stronger and\nmore dangerous than most.\nFalse hope syndrome is when you expect that you will be able to\nchange or improve to an unrealistic degree. When you inevitably\nfail to meet this mark, there is a very real backlash that results in\nyou being even less motivated and disciplined than before you\nstarted. To beat this, set proper expectations based on your history\nand understand the difference between goals and expectations.\nOverthinking is sneaky because it feels like action and it even feels\nproductive. But it’s not. Overthinking is when you fixate and can’t\nseem to take the first step toward action. Zero in on the details that\nmatter, deliberately ignore everything else, and you’ll feel much\nmore clarity.\nWorrying is when you fixate on something and inevitably start\ndrawing out the negative scenarios and pitfalls. However, worrying\nis also when you fixate on things you can’t control while ignoring\nwhat you can control—the present. The solution is to focus on what\nyou can do right now and only right now.\nDo you know yourself? Well, what about in terms of productivity\nand how you work and produce the best? You can consider time of\nday, environment, setting, and so on. But you should consider that\nknowing yourself is also the ability to look at yourself and\nunderstand why you may have failed or come up short. It is the\nability to self-diagnose and be self-aware."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 8. Daily Systems for Success\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNed started his own software consulting firm. He was thrilled to be his own\nboss and did not anticipate that he would have any trouble managing\nclients, answering emails, generating leads, sending out invoices,\nperforming his consulting work, and so on!\n \nAt first, everything in Ned’s business was great. He would wake up early,\nanswer emails, and send out newsletters to generate leads. Then he would\nget to his normal job. When he had spare time, he would get back to emails.\nLate into the night, he would be working, trying to market himself while\nalso working on his various projects.\n \nBut as his business took off, suddenly his inbox was inundated! His list of\nprojects grew longer and longer. Suddenly, he was completely\noverwhelmed. Putting in 12-hour days at the very least, he struggled to\ncatch up with emails, follow up with clients, send out invoices in a timely\nmanner, and meet deadlines. He felt as if he were drowning. Angry clients\nwould harass him, demanding to know where their work was!\n \nSeeing his desk would have made Martha Stewart weep. Ned would spend\nup to 15 minutes looking for important papers or notes that he had made on\nprojects. His home office was a jumbled mess. The room that he has so\ncheerfully painted and decorated was now a prison, where he spent almost\nall of his time.\n\f\nNed himself looked even worse. He looked like a zombie and subsisted on\ncoffee and fast food. His eyes developed deep bags under them.\nThen he realized that he was losing leads and losing money. Bad reviews\nbegan to pile up on his website and his freelancing profile. It looked as if\nhis consulting firm was failing.\n \nWhat did Ned do wrong? He didn’t use a system. He relied on himself to\nget everything done and did not implement a way to organize and\nstreamline his work to make it easier. He took on too much at once, trying\nto accomplish tons of goals each day without using a system to make those\ngoals easier.\n \nWillpower is great to a degree. You certainly need it in your life to push you\nto be the best that you can be. But relying on your willpower and self-\ndiscipline alone to be successful can fail you if you rely on it too heavily\nbecause you cannot push yourself past your maximum. Once you hit your\nmaximum, your willpower and self-discipline cannot push you to move\nforward. Willpower and self-discipline are fickle and can crumble when you\nbecome overwhelmed.\n \nThe story of Ned is a great glimpse into what happens when you try to\nalways push yourself to do things that you need to do for success in life.\nOvercoming the sense of being overwhelmed and overworked is not easy.\nYou have to create an organizational system to make your success\nconsistent even when you’re feeling glum and fatigued.\n \nParticularly in business, there will be days when the inertia is too heavy and\nyou don’t feel like performing the tasks on your to-do list. There will be\ntasks that you dread doing and thus can’t summon the necessary willpower.\nAnd there will even be people who try to block your success, and you may\nnot always have the strength to fight them off.\n \nThat is where daily systems come into play.\n \nA system is a set of actions that you consistently perform every day in order\nto streamline your success and reach your goals. Unlike your self-discipline\n\f\nand willpower, a system organizes you and helps you perform your duties\nwithout having to push yourself. Willpower and self-discipline, on the other\nhand, only offer you strength to force yourself to do things; they do not give\nyou a set way of doing things or a streamlined list of actions to complete.\n \nA system becomes routine so that you do not have to think about what you\nneed to do, but instead you just do it. The key to a system is to work on\nprogress and consistency in your life, as opposed to working on goals. For\ninstance, let’s go back to Ned and consider if he had used a time\nmanagement system to split up tasks and make time for each task. He could\nhave automated things so that he could have gotten all of his tasks done in a\ntimelier manner, with less stress, disorganization, and confusion.\n \nHad Ned implemented a few simple daily systems into his approach to his\nbusiness, he would have been more successful. Ned relied on his self-\ndiscipline too much. He just could not force himself to do so much work on\nhis own. Working at maximum, he burned out and began to fail.\n \nFor perspective, a goal is antithetical to a system because goals play a part\nin systems. Systems are simply ways to make sure you take the actions\nnecessary to reach a goal. They are not limited to one thing at a time, as\ngoals are; instead, they apply to everything you must do in your endeavor.\nOnce you complete one goal, you can move onto the next one easily by\nsimply following your system. Systems will carry you through every single\ngoal you set.\n \nSystems also protect you from failure even if you do not reach a goal. Say\nyour goal for the day is to complete 1000 words of writing for a grant\nproposal. You use a system to help you get some work done, but you do not\nreach the 1000-word mark. That is fully acceptable, because you still got\nsome writing done. A system enables you to reach a better place, even if\nyou do not meet your exact goal. From that better place, it is even easier to\nmove forward and accomplish your ultimate goal later on. Every day is a\nchance to get closer and closer to your final goal when you have a good\nsystem in place."

    "raw_text": "Ned focused on accomplishing a series of goals each day, such as\ngenerating new leads and finishing projects. He did not implement any sort\nof system that forced him to perform the necessary actions for his goals at a\nspecific time each day. Had he implemented a system and structured his\nwork, he would have been able to tackle his goals in a timely manner\ninstead of working in chaos and exhausting himself. Then his business\nwould have thrived as he earned new clients and pleased old ones\nsimultaneously.\n \nCreating systems begins with having an overall goal in mind. Then you can\nbuild the scaffolding that will get you there.\n \nKeep a Scoreboard\n \nThe first type of system is to keep a detailed scoreboard for yourself. The\nheart of this system is that you’ll be far more motivated if you feel that you\nhave the possibility to win something. You must see some type of gain to\nfuel interest in the project. Therefore, you want to keep score.\n \nPeople play at their best when they feel as if they are winning or losing, so\nbe sure to demonstrate how you are progressing and winning. People play\ndifferently when they are keeping score. If you’re not keeping score, you’re\njust practicing. So start keeping score today to provide automatic\nmotivation for yourself and others. Here are some things you can do to keep\na scoreboard.\n \nFirst, track your progress. Every time you get something done, check it off\nof your list. Seeing your tasks checked off will give you a sense that you are\nactually getting something done. A big to-do list on a whiteboard mounted\non the wall can help you. This is so motivating because people can visually\nsee they are getting things done, and seeing what they complete makes them\nrealize that the target goal is more and more possible.\n \nAnother important element of this system is to celebrate small victories for\nyou and those you are working with whenever you see a victory. The\nsmaller the victory, the better, because it is a chance to motivate yourself\n\f\nand others. This also allows you to have an overall greater number of\nvictories to feel good about and celebrate momentum with. Find every little\nsmall victory—be it scoring a new client or finding a way around an\nobstacle you face. Create friendly competition to boost this concept, even if\nyou have to compete with your own past performance.\n \nFinally, always have an ultimate reward or incentive at the end of the\nproject. When you meet the ultimate goal that you have set, reward\nyourself. Having some type of reward set up for when you hit your goal can\ngive you something to look forward to, which pushes you forward even\nwhen you want to give up. Treat yourself to a spa day when you hit that\nmark, for example, or treat your team to a night out. This mentality is why\nbonuses work well to motivate workers in companies.\n \nAn example of how to integrate this system into your work life is to create a\nlist of things you wish to accomplish. When you check off an item on the\nlist, have a small celebration, such as a pizza party for the whole team. Be\nsure to set incentives, such as bonuses or a day trip, at the end. For every\nsale, you want to mark it and celebrate it. View every day as a chance to\nrack up more points on your scoreboard.\n \nTime Management\n \nA time management system is essential to success for anyone. Knowing\nhow to divvy up your time and how much time to give to each task will\nhelp you complete goals on time. Time management is essential because it\nreally helps you get things done by your deadline, and it provides\nmotivation to follow through on tasks. You can set realistic expectations\nonce you know an approximate time frame for everything you do.\n \nTo practice good time management, first set a routine for your work. A\nroutine is a system that enables you to know what to do when. You know\nyou need to start work at nine, for example. Take deadlines and other time\ncommitments into account when setting up your routine. Be sure to set\naside time for work, eating, sleep, appointments, and other commitments. In\naddition, don’t neglect yourself or you will hit your maximum and become\n\f\ntoo stressed to handle work. So be sure to also tend to your health, sleep\nwell, and eat right.\n \nAlways assess your time needs on a project. Ask yourself, “How much time\nwill something take?” To get a better idea of your time needs, you can time\nyourself on certain tasks to get an idea of how long things take you at your\nnormal, comfortable pace. You should never feel hectic or stressed with a\ngood time management system, so be sure to time yourself doing things at a\npace that does not stress you out and give yourself some wiggle room for\nunforeseen issues that may cause you to need more time.\n \nRead over your daily tasks at the start of the day. When you get to work or\neven when you wake up, look over a planner and see what you have\nplanned for the day. This helps you ensure that you meet goals in a timely\nmanner. Be sure to account time for important appointments, as well as the\namount of time you need to do things related to your business, such as\nanswering emails, attending networking events, and having strategy\nmeetings.\n \nMinimize distractions whenever you are working. Focus on one thing at a\ntime. Multitasking and having distractions can drastically cut down on your\nproductivity. Set a specific time to check emails, for example, instead of\nchecking emails throughout the day and letting your inbox distract you from\nthe task at hand. Also have a set time to focus on marketing or on\nnetworking.\n \nLower Your Transaction Costs\n \nTransaction costs is an economic term for the cost you must expend to be in\nthe market.\n \nWhenever you do something, you have some sort of cost associated with it.\nThe cost may be monetary, such as an investment to start a business. Or it\nmay be emotional, such as the apprehension of embarking on a new\nbusiness opportunity without knowing if you will succeed or fail. Or it\n\f\ncould even be physical, demanding your physical prowess and labor. These\nare simply the costs, or obstacles, you have to overcome to play the game.\n \nBuild a system around manipulating these costs to your benefit. Cut out the\ncosts that tax you and make the gains you want convenient and easy.. Make\nit harder on yourself to do unproductive things, such as procrastinating, by\nraising the costs that such habits will create for you. Meanwhile, lower the\ntransaction costs on things you want to do more consistently. You want to\nencourage good habits, such as systematic work and time management, by\nmaking them easier for you so that they “cost” less. Meanwhile, flip the\ntables and make bad habits, like being disorganized, having poor time\nmanagement, and procrastinating, too expensive to entertain.\n \nFor example, by being more organized, you have less stress and spend less\ntime looking for things you need in the office. So that makes it easier to\npractice this behavior. Find effortless means to organize your office without\nspending too much money and without taking too much time. Use a simple\ncolor coding system for papers and use boxes laying around the house to\ncreate paper bins that you label clearly with a Sharpie. This costs almost\nnothing, yet it saves you so much hassle as you work.\n \nNotice how the behavior of being organized becomes easier with reduced\ncosts and how that good habit makes reaching your goal easier. You just cut\ndown on your costs by reducing the taxation of being disorganized. Plus,\nyou expended almost no money or effort organizing your office.\n \nMake undesired behaviors cost too much. Train yourself to view bad\nbehavior as something that is too expensive to engage in. For example, raise\nthe costs of unproductive behavior by forcing yourself to climb five flights\nof stairs to smoke or eat chocolate or browse your phone.\n \nLet’s look at how to generally manipulate transaction costs. The first part of\nthis is to make good habits cost nothing. The reward must be greater than\nthe cost for a good behavior. This is the only way to motivate yourself to\nmake positive changes. For example, you might make it easier to be\norganized by spending less money on an organizational system for the\n\f\noffice, and you can make it so simple to find things in the office that it\nreduces stress at work.\n \nMake bad habits cost a lot. You won’t want to engage in a bad habit if the\ncosts outweigh the profit. A good example is to reduce unproductivity by\nmaking time that you spend not working lose you money.\n \nConsider how Ned could have reduced his transaction costs. The amount of\nwork he put into his business became too much for him to handle alone and\nhe quickly hit his maximum, where he could not function anymore. By\nmaking work easier and being disorganized harder, he could have made his\nlife and work much more efficient. He should have made his bad habits\n(working 12-hour days) too expensive for him to afford and his good habits\n(organization) practically effortless.\n \nGather All Information First\n \nThis system is about gathering everything you require for a project before\nyou even start the project. Find the information that is critical to the project\nand try to complete your research phase all in one go. This system saves\nyou the time of trying to gather resources while you are immersed in your\nproject. You can focus on the project rather than on gathering resources and\ninformation. This removes the hurdles that halt momentum.\n \nYou can use momentum to roll forward, making the project easier to\nperform as you are in the middle of it. Having to stop your work to find out\ninformation or find a supply can kill momentum. Momentum is when you\nwork without stopping, letting each completed goal build on top of each\nother to make the next goal easier to complete.\n \nFor example, before a big work project, you may need a team of people\nwith certain skills or a single partner. You may need some basic supplies or\na specific software. Even consider the office supplies you will need, such as\npens and paper, and have them at hand. Gather all of the resources you need\nand have them ready before you even commence working. Also, list all of\nthe information you will need before working, such as contact information\n\f\nfor other workers and the deadline, so that you do not have to search for this\ninformation while you are busy. Think of it like carrying all the groceries\nout of your car in one trip.\n \nIn Kerry Patterson’s book Crucial Conversations, he suggests some of the\ninformation you must gather or assess before you embark on any project.\nAssign responsibility. Ask “Who is responsible for what?” Assign a name\nto each task that must be completed. This is essential for creating clarity.\nYou want to have a leader, a person in charge of budgeting, a person in\ncharge of marketing, a person in charge of human resources, and so on. For\nevery aspect of your project, find someone who can handle it. If you are\nhandling everything by yourself because you are working solo, then\ndelegate responsibility to yourself by splitting your tasks into different roles\nand then performing each of those roles separately at different times to\nensure you complete them.\nSpecify your desired outcome and expectations. Be very specific about\nwhat you want to accomplish and what you expect to do. Having a target\noutcome can guide you in success by making it clear to you what tasks you\nhave to complete and how you need to work. Specify how much work you\nwant to get done, how many units you want to sell, how much money you\nwant to make, and when you want to meet your goals by. Go ahead and set\nclear goals that are both reachable and inspiring. For example, you may\nwant to look at previous sales and say, “Okay, we sold 1000 units last\nmonth. Let’s hit 1200 this month!”\nDetermine the deadline. You probably have a deadline set by your boss or\nclient. If you don’t, set one yourself. Nothing will motivate you like a\nspecific date when you must have a project completed by. Deadlines can\ngive you a clear guideline for how to structure your time and when to meet\nmilestones. Make sure to set a realistic deadline—do not promise someone\nthe moon and then not be able to deliver. You want to set a deadline that\ngives you plenty of room to complete something by, taking into account\npotential setbacks and challenges that cost you time.\nHave a follow-up plan. You don’t want to think of your current goal as the\nfinish line because life goes on after you reach the goal. What happens after\nthe project? What do you do next? Have a plan for the steps to take once\n\f\nyou complete a project and what goals to move on to. This can motivate\nyou as you have more things to look forward to.\nAlso consider following.\nGather physical resources. You will need different things to get something\ndone—money, people, software, office supplies, materials. Find out what\nyou need and obtain all of it.\n \nIdentify obstacles. Knowing the obstacles beforehand can help you\ndetermine how to mitigate them. People will have a ton of enthusiasm when\nthey brainstorm ideas; they see only sunshine and are eager to press on.\nWhen unexpected obstacles arise, however, their enthusiasm runs out and\ninertia sets in. If everyone involved knows what to expect and thinks of\nthese obstacles as hurdles to overcome as a team, then morale will not be so\nheavily impacted. If you see no obstacles in your path, you need to\nbrainstorm more to account for potential pitfalls.\n \nBack to our example of poor Ned. Imagine how much easier things would\nhave been for him if he had organized his resources and gathered\ninformation first. First, he should have organized his office, putting notes\nwhere it would be easy to find them when he needed them. Next, he should\nhave found the software programs that would have let him automate emails,\nnewsletters, quotes, and invoices, which would have lessened the workload\nhe carried by himself. Finally, he should have anticipated the volume of\nwork coming in so that he could have managed his time better and handled\nhis workload more efficiently. He should have set deadlines and made sure\nto meet them. He could have considered hiring someone else to take on\nsome of his responsibility had he estimated how much work he was going\nto gain.\n \nOn top of that, he should have identified challenges and prepared for them,\nsuch as having too great of a workload. Then he could have mitigated these\nchallenges with a bit of forethought. Gathering all of these resources\nbeforehand could have saved Ned so much work after he launched his\nbusiness.\n\f\nDaily systems streamline work and cut down on the amount of willpower\nyou require to plug on in life. They make actions systematic and therefore\nthey encourage progress. You can avoid failure in your life by using\nsystems to implement efficiency and forward progress. Don’t be a Ned. Use\ndaily systems to propel yourself into success.\n \nTakeaways:\n \nSystems are sets of daily behaviors. It doesn’t have to be more\ncomplex than that. Systems stand in stark contrast to goals because\ngoals are one-off accomplishments, while systems emphasize\nconsistency and long-term success.\nKeep a scoreboard for everything large and trivial. This keeps you\nmotivated and striving toward growth and progress.\nManage your time better by understanding how long things will\ntake in reality and accounting for your own quirks and\ninefficiencies.\nLower your transaction costs by making undesirable behaviors\ninconvenient and unwieldy while making desirable behaviors\nconvenient and easy.\nGather all of the information and materials you need all at once and\nbefore you get started. This allows you to work interruption-free\nand gather momentum."

    "raw_text": "Summary Guide\n \nBefore getting to the overall book summary… I would be highly, greatly,\namazingly grateful and appreciative if you felt like taking just 30 seconds\nand leaving me a review on Amazon! Reviews are incredibly important to\nan author’s livelihood, and they are shockingly hard to come by. Strange,\nright?\n \nAnyway, the more reviews my books get, the more I am actually able to\ncontinue my first love of writing. If you felt any way about this book,\nplease leave me a review and let me know that I’m on the right track \u0000  \nCLICK HERE TO REVIEW\n \n \nChapter 1. Stop Thinking, Just Execute\n \nThe art of following through is something that allows you to create\nthe life that you actually want instead of settling for the life you\ncurrently have.\nIt can be said to be composed of four parts: focus, self-discipline,\naction, and persistence—all equally important.\nHowever, it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus\ndoing it. There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start\nand follow through very often. These reasons can generally be split\ninto two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks.\nInhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without\neven realizing it. They include (1) setting bad goals, (2)\nprocrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and\n(4) poor time management.\nPsychological roadblocks are the ways we don’t follow through\nbecause we are unconsciously protecting ourselves. These include\n(1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of judgment, rejection,\nand failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4) lack of self-\nawareness.\n\f\nChapter 2: Staying Hungry\n \nHow do we stay hungry and motivated? By delving deep and really\nasking what internal and external motivators you have at your\ndisposal—a task that is rarely performed.\nExternal motivators are when we leverage other people, places, and\nthings to push us into action. For the most part, these are when we\nwant to avoid negative consequences involving other people,\nplaces, and things. These methods include accountability partners\nand groups, putting money down upfront, and self-bribery.\nInternal motivators are when we look at how we stand to benefit\nand improve our lives. These are universal needs, drives, and\ndesires that are easy to lose track of. The easy way to find these is\nto answer a set of questions that directly asks things such as how am\nI going to benefit from this and how does my life stand to improve\nfrom this? It’s only through answering these questions that you\nrealize what you are neglecting.\nAnything we want to accomplish has an associated opportunity\ncost. We must sacrifice, even if we are sacrificing our ability to lie\non the couch and watch television. We can deal with this mental\nobstacle by playing with the cost-benefit ratio so the cost is\nminimized or the benefit is maximized.\nMotivation has been shown to work best when we are reminded of\nit—otherwise, out of sight, out of mind. Thus, you should have cues\nyou’re your motivations all around you—but make sure to keep\nthem distinct and memorable, use all five senses (even taste), and\nmake sure to change and switch them periodically to avoid growing\nused to them and forgetting them.\n \nChapter 3: Create a Manifesto\n \nA manifesto is nothing more than a set of rules to follow every day.\nWe might hate rules, but rules take the guesswork out of our days\nand give us guidelines to follow. They make matters black and\nwhite, which is helpful to following through because there is simply\nno other choice."

    "raw_text": "Rule 1: Are you acting out of laziness? If so, is this a\ncharacterization you want about yourself?\nRule 2: Three major tasks a day, maximum. Differentiate between\nimportant tasks, urgent tasks, and simple wasted motion.\nRule 3: Create daily limitations and requirements for yourself.\nThese keep you within the bounds of what you know you need to\ndo. These are also the building blocks of good habits.\nRule 4: Sometimes we lose sight of what we want to accomplish.\nThus, reaffirm your intentions by stating “I want,” “I will,” and “I\nwon’t” statements.\nRule 5: Try to look into the future, 10 minutes, hours, and days at a\ntime. Do you like what you see when you consider not following\nthrough? Is it worth the benefit to the current self at the expense of\nthe future self? Probably not.\nRule 6: It’s just 10 minutes, right? So if you want to quit, it’s just 10\nminutes. And if you need to wait, it’s just 10 minutes.\n \nChapter 4: Follow-Through Mindsets\n \nFollowing through is 100% mental, which means it’s probably a\ngood idea to talk about the mindsets you attempt to embody.\nMindset 1: It’s all worthwhile. If you feel that your hard work will\nget you somewhere, you belong and are as good as anyone else, and\nyou feel impact toward your overall goals, execution is easier to\nstick with.\nMindset 2: Become comfortable with discomfort. Everything you\nwant to do will have elements of discomfort, unless you just want to\nwatch television all day by yourself. Thus, becoming used to this\nfeeling allows you to tackle what you want without fear.\nMindset 3: Without following through, there is no learning. Only\nwhen you finish something can you evaluate yourself and correct\nyour errors. Embody an information-gathering mindset.\nMindset 4: The detrimental power of stress and anxiety can’t be\noverstated. Even being in a poor mood is dangerous to your\nproductivity and follow-through. Be aware and take proactive\nmeasures to modulate your stress levels."

    "raw_text": "Chapter 5: The Science of Smashing Procrastination\nTackling procrastination is similar to pushing Sisyphus’s stone. You\ncan beat it back for a bit, but it’s so natural that you will never be\nfully rid of it. The problem is typified by time inconsistency, where\nwe comprise two selves that don’t have overlapping desires—one\nwants gratification in the future and the other wants it right now.\nTemptation bundling is an effective method to battle\nprocrastination. It consists of combining your unpleasurable tasks\nwith something pleasurable. This mainly works because you are\nbattling time inconsistency and giving both selves what they want\nsimultaneously.\nStart easy and small. Procrastination thrives off inertia. Therefore,\nyou need to make the path to motion and action as easy as possible.\nThen eventually you can gain momentum—the opposite of inertia.\nSometimes beating procrastination just requires a kick in the pants.\nFear and productive paranoia can do that to you—if you are so\nfearful of the negative repercussions you will face, then you will\ncertainly be spurred into action. But this is not a method to use very\nfrequently.\nChapter 6. No Distraction Zone\n \nMinimize your distractions in your environment. It turns out that\nout of sight is out of mind with distractions, so don’t keep anything\nstimulating near your workstation otherwise your willpower will\nslowly deplete itself.\nCreate default actions wherever possible. This is where the easiest\nand lowest resistance past for you is the path you want the most.\nThis is also done through curating and designing your environment\nfor productivity.\nSingletasking is an important concept because it definitively proves\nthe flaws of multitasking. When you switch from task to task, you\ncreate attention residue. This means it takes a while for you to\nadjust to each new task, even if you were already familiar with it.\nYou can eliminate this by singletasking, and also by batching,\n\f\nwhich is when you do all similar types of tasks together to\ncapitalize on your mental efficiency.\nA don’t-do list can be just as powerful as a to-do list because we are\nrarely told what to ignore. As a result, these distractions or sneaky\ntime-suckers can invade our space without us even knowing we are\nbeing duped. Include tasks you can’t move forward on, make\nprogress on, or help.\nThe 40–70 rule is when you beat inaction through the amount of\ninformation you seek. If you have less than 40%, don’t act. But if\nyou have 70%, you must act. You’ll never have 100%, and chances\nare, 70% is more than sufficient—the rest you learn along the way,\nanyway.\nFinally, you might want to do nothing from time to time. This is rest\nand relaxation—but you should think of it as mental recovery. What\ndoes an athlete do between races or matches? You got it—they\nrecover so they are primed to work again when necessary.\nChapter 7: Deadly Pitfalls\n \nPitfalls to following through and finishing what you start? Too\nmany to name. But a select few in this chapter are stronger and\nmore dangerous than most.\nFalse hope syndrome is when you expect that you will be able to\nchange or improve to an unrealistic degree. When you inevitably\nfail to meet this mark, there is a very real backlash that results in\nyou being even less motivated and disciplined than before you\nstarted. To beat this, set proper expectations based on your history\nand understand the difference between goals and expectations.\nOverthinking is sneaky because it feels like action and it even feels\nproductive. But it’s not. Overthinking is when you fixate and can’t\nseem to take the first step toward action. Zero in on the details that\nmatter, deliberately ignore everything else, and you’ll feel much\nmore clarity.\nWorrying is when you fixate on something and inevitably start\ndrawing out the negative scenarios and pitfalls. However, worrying\nis also when you fixate on things you can’t control while ignoring\n\f\nwhat you can control—the present. The solution is to focus on what\nyou can do right now and only right now.\nDo you know yourself? Well, what about in terms of productivity\nand how you work and produce the best? You can consider time of\nday, environment, setting, and so on. But you should consider that\nknowing yourself is also the ability to look at yourself and\nunderstand why you may have failed or come up short. It is the\nability to self-diagnose and be self-aware.\n \nChapter 8. Daily Systems for Success\n \nSystems are sets of daily behaviors. It doesn’t have to be more\ncomplex than that. Systems stand in stark contrast to goals because\ngoals are one-off accomplishments, while systems emphasize\nconsistency and long-term success.\nKeep a scoreboard for everything large and trivial. This keeps you\nmotivated and striving toward growth and progress.\nManage your time better by understanding how long things will\ntake in reality and accounting for your own quirks and\ninefficiencies.\nLower your transaction costs by making undesirable behaviors\ninconvenient and unwieldy while making desirable behaviors\nconvenient and easy.\nGather all of the information and materials you need all at once and\nbefore you get started. This allows you to work interruption-free\nand gather moment."
