Or, maybe, yesterday;  I can’t be sure. Th e telegram from the \nHome says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP \nSYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday. \nThe Home for Aged Persons is at Maren go, some fifty m iles from Algiers. With \nthe two o’clock bus I shoul d get there well before night fall. Th en I can spend the \nnight there, keeping the usual vigil besi de the body, and be back here by tom orrow \nevening. I have fixed up with m y employer for two days’ leave; obviously, under t he \ncircumstances, he couldn’t refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed, and I said, \nwithout thinking: “Sorry, sir, but it’s not my fault, you know.” \nAfterwards it struck me I needn’t have said that. I had no reason to excuse m yself; \nit was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth. Probably he will do so the da y \nafter tomorrow, when he sees me  in black. For the present,  it’s alm ost as if Mother \nweren’t really dead. The funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so \nto speak. ... \nI took the two-o’clock bus. It was a blazing hot afternoon. I’d lunched, as usual, at \nCéleste’s restaurant. Everyone was m ost kind, and Céleste said to me, “There’s no \none like a mother.” When I left they came with me to the door. It was something of a \nrush, getting away, as at the last mo ment I had to call in at Emmanuel’s place to  \nborrow his black tie and mourning band. He lost his uncle a few months ago. \nI had to run to catch the bus. I suppose it was my hurrying like that, wh at with the \nglare off the road and from the sky, the reek  of gasoline, and the jolts, that m ade me \nfeel so drowsy. Anyhow, I slept most of the way. When I woke I was leaning against \na soldier; he grinned and asked me if I’d come from  a long way off, and I just \nnodded, to cut things short. I wasn’t in a mood for talking. \nThe Home is a little over a m ile from the v illage. I went there on foot. I asked to \nbe allowed to see Mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me I must see the warden \nfirst. He wasn’t free, and I had to wait a bit. The doorkeeper chatted with me while I \nwaited; then he led me to the office. Th e warden was a ver y small man, with g ray \nhair, and a Legion of Honor ro sette in his butt onhole. He gave me a long look wit h \nhis watery blue eyes. Then we shook hands, and he held mine so long that I began to \nfeel embarrassed. After that he consulted a register on his table, and said: \n“Madame Meursault entered the Ho me three years ago. She ha d no private means \nand depended entirely on you.” \n 4"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI had a feeling he was blam ing me for some thing, and started to explain. But he \ncut me short. \n“There’s no need t o excuse yourself, my boy. I’ve looke d up t he record and \nobviously you weren’t in a position to s ee that she was properly cared for. She \nneeded someone to be with her all the time, and young m en in jobs like yours don’t  \nget too much pay. In any case, she was much happier in the Home.” \nI said, “Yes, sir; I’m sure of that.” \nThen he added: “She had good friends here, you know, old folks like herself, and \none gets on better with people of one’s own generation. You’re much too young; you \ncouldn’t have been much of a companion to her.” \nThat was so. When we lived t ogether, Mother was always watching me, but we \nhardly ever talked. During her first few we eks at the Ho me she used to cry a go od \ndeal. But that was only because she hadn’t settled down. After a month or two she’d \nhave cried if she’d been told to leave the Home. Because this, too, would have been a \nwrench. That was why, during the last year, I seldom went  to see her. Also, it w ould \nhave m eant losing m y Sunday—not t o me ntion the troubl e of goi ng to the bus, \ngetting my ticket, and spending two hours on the journey each way. \nThe warden went on talking, but I didn’t pay much attention. Finally he said: \n“Now, I suppose you’d like to see your mother?” \nI rose without repl ying, and he led the way to the door. As we were going down \nthe stairs he explained: \n“I’ve had the body m oved to our little m ortuary—so as not to upset the other old \npeople, you understand. Every time there’s a death here, they’re in a nervous state for \ntwo or three days. Which means, of course, extra work and worry for our staff.” \nWe crossed a courtyard where there were  a num ber of old men, talking am ongst \nthemselves in little groups. They fell silent  as we came up with them. Then, behind \nour backs, the chattering began again. Th eir voices rem inded me of parakeets in a \ncage, only the sound wasn’t quite so shril l. The warden stopped outside t he entrance \nof a small, low building. \n“So here I leave you, Monsieur Meursa ult. If you want me for anything, you’ll \nfind me in m y office. We propose to have  the fune ral tomorrow morning. That will \nenable you to spend the night beside your m other’s coffin, as no doubt you would \nwish to do. Just one m ore thing; I gat hered from  your mother’s fri ends that she \nwished to be buried with the rites of the Church. I’ve made arrangements for this; but \nI thought I should let you know.” \nI thanked him . So far as I knew, m y mother, though not a professed atheist, had \nnever given a thought to religion in her life. \nI entered t he mortuary. It was a bright,  spotlessly clean room , with whit ewashed \nwalls and a big skyli ght. The furniture consisted of some chairs and trestles. Two of \nthe latter stood open in the center of the r oom and the coffin rested on them . The lid \n 5\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwas in place, but the screws had been given only a few turns and their nickeled heads \nstuck out above the wood, which was stained dark walnut.  An Arab woman—a \nnurse, I supposed— was sitting beside the bier; she was wearing a blue sm ock and \nhad a rather gaudy scarf wound round her hair. \nJust then the keeper came up behind me. He’d evidently been running, as he was a \nlittle out of breath. \n“We put the lid on, but I was t old to unscrew it when you came, so that you coul d \nsee her.” \nWhile he was going up to the coffin I told him not to trouble. \n“Eh? What’s that?” he exclaimed. “You don’t want me to ...?” \n“No,” I said. \nHe put back the screwdriver in his pocket a nd stared at me. I r ealized then that I \nshouldn’t have said, “No,” an d it m ade me rather em barrassed. After eying m e for \nsome moments he asked: \n“Why not?” But he didn’t sound reproachful; he simply wanted to know. \n“Well, really I couldn’t say,” I answered. \nHe began twiddling his white mustache; then, without looking at me, said gently: \n“I understand.” \nHe was a pleasant-looki ng man, with bl ue eyes and ruddy c heeks. He drew up a \nchair for me n ear the coffin, and seated  himself just behind. The nurse got up and \nmoved toward the door. As she was going by, the keeper whispered in my ear: \n“It’s a tumor she has, poor thing.” \nI looked at her more carefully and I noticed that she had a bandage round her head, \njust below her eyes. It lay quite flat across the bridge of her nose, and one saw hardly \nanything of her face except that strip of whiteness. \nAs soon as she had gone, the keeper rose. \n“Now I’ll leave you to yourself.” \nI don’t know whether I made some gesture,  but instead of going he halted behind \nmy chair. The sensation of som eone posted at my back made me unco mfortable. The \nsun was getting low  and the whole room  was flooded with a pleasant, mellow light. \nTwo hornets were buzzing overhead, against the skylight. I was so sleepy I could \nhardly keep my eyes open. Without looking round, I asked the keeper how long he’d \nbeen at the Home. “Five years.” The answer came so pat that one could have thought \nhe’d been expecting my question. \nThat started him off, and he became quite  chatty. If anyone had told him  ten years \nago that he’d end hi s days as doorkeeper at a home at Marengo, he’d never have \nbelieved it. He was sixty-four, he said, and hailed from Paris. \nWhen he said that, I broke in. “Ah, you don’t come from here?” \nI remembered then that, before taking m e to the warden, he’d told m e something \nabout Mother. He had said she’d have to  be buried m ighty quickly because of the \n 6\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nheat in these parts, especially down in t he plain. “At Paris they keep the body for \nthree days, sometimes four.” After that he had mentioned that he’d spent the best part \nof his life in Paris, a nd could never manage to forget it.  “Here,” he had said, “t hings \nhave to go with a rush, like. You’ve hard ly time to get used to the idea that \nsomeone’s dead, before you’re  hauled off to  the funeral.” “That’s enough,” his w ife \nhad put in. “You didn’t ought t o say such things to the poor young gentleman.” The \nold fellow had blushed and begun to apologize.  I told him it was quite all right. As a \nmatter of fact, I found it rather interesti ng, what he’d been telling me; I hadn’t \nthought of that before. \nNow he went on to say that he’d entered the Home as an ordi nary inmate. But he \nwas still quite hale and hearty, and when  the keeper’s job fell vacant, h e offered to \ntake it on. \nI pointed out that, even so, he was really an inmate like the others, but he wouldn’t \nhear of it. He was “ an official, like.” I’d been struck before by his habit of saying \n“they” or,  less ofte n, “them  old folks, ” when referring to inm ates no ol der t han \nhimself. Still, I could see his point of vie w. As doorkeeper he had a certain standing, \nand some authority over the rest of them. \nJust then the nurse returned. Night had fallen very quickl y; all of a sudden, it \nseemed, the sky went black above the sky light. The keeper switched on the lamps, \nand I was almost blinded by the blaze of light. \nHe suggested I should go to the refectory for dinner, but I wasn’t hungry. Then he \nproposed bringing me a mug of café au lait . As I am  very partial to café au lait  I \nsaid, “Thanks,” and a few m inutes later he came back with  a tray. I drank the coffee,  \nand then I wanted a cigarette. But I wasn’t sure if I should sm oke, under the \ncircumstances—in Mother’s presence. I t hought it over; re ally, it di dn’t seem to \nmatter, so I offered the keeper a cigarette, and we both smoked. \nAfter a while he started talking again. \n“You know, your mother’s fri ends will be com ing soon, to keep vigil with you \nbeside the body. We always have a ‘vigil’  here, when anyone di es. I’d better go and \nget some chairs and a pot of black coffee.” \nThe glare off the white walls  was making m y eyes smart,  and I asked him  if he \ncouldn’t turn off one of the lam ps. “Not hing doing,” he said. They’d arranged the \nlights like that; either one had them  all on or none at all. After that I di dn’t pay much \nmore attention to him. He went out, brought some chairs, and set them out round the \ncoffin. On one he placed a coffeepot a nd ten or a dozen cups. Then he sat down \nfacing me, on the far side of Mother. The nurse was at the other end of t he room, \nwith her back to me. I couldn’t see what  she was doing, but  by the way her arms  \nmoved I guessed that she was knitting. I was feeling very comfortable; the coffee had \nwarmed me up, and through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of \ncool night air. I think I dozed off for a while. \n 7\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI was wakened by an odd rust ling in my ears. After having had m y eyes closed, I  \nhad a feeling that the light had grown even stronger than before. There wasn’t a trace \nof shadow  anywhere, and every object, each  curve or angle, seemed to score its \noutline on one’s eyes. The old people, Moth er’s friends, were com ing in. I counted \nten in all, gliding alm ost soundlessly t hrough the bleak white glare. None of the \nchairs creaked when they sat down. Never in  my life had I seen anyone so clearly as \nI saw these people; not a detail of their cl othes or features escaped me. And yet I \ncouldn’t hear them, and it was hard to believe they really existed. \nNearly all the women wore aprons, and the strings drawn tight round t heir waists \nmade their big stomachs bulge still m ore. I’d never yet notic ed what big paunches \nold women usually have. Most of the m en, however, were as thin as rakes, and they \nall carried sticks. What struck me m ost about their faces was that one c ouldn’t see \ntheir eyes, only a dull glow in a sort of nest of wrinkles. \nOn sitting down, they looked at m e, and wagged their heads awkwardly, their lips \nsucked in between their toot hless gums. I c ouldn’t decide if they were greeting me \nand trying to say something, or if it was due to some infirm ity of age. I inclined to \nthink that they were greeting me, after their fashion,  but it had a queer effect, s eeing \nall those old fellows grouped round the keeper, solemnly eying me and dandling their \nheads from side to side. For a moment I had an absurd impression that they had come \nto sit in judgment on me. \nA few minutes later one of the women started weeping. She was in the second row \nand I coul dn’t see her face because of anot her woman in front. At regular intervals \nshe emitted a little choking sob; one had a f eeling she would never stop. The others \ndidn’t seem to notice. They sat in silence,  slu mped in their chairs, staring at the \ncoffin or a t their walking st icks or any obj ect just in front of them , and never took \ntheir eyes off it. And still the woman sobbed. I was rather surprised, as I didn’t know \nwho she was. I wanted her t o stop cryi ng, but dared not speak to her. After a while \nthe keeper bent toward her and whispered in her ear; but she me rely shook her head, \nmumbled something I couldn’t catch, and went on sobbing as steadily as before. \nThe keeper got up a nd moved his chair beside  mine. At first he kept silent; then,  \nwithout looking at me, he explained. \n“She was devoted to your mother. She says your mother was her only friend in the \nworld, and now she’s all alone.” \nI had nothing t o say, and the si lence lasted quite a while. Presently the wo man’s \nsighs and sobs became less frequent, and, after blowing her nose and snuffling for \nsome minutes, she, too, fell silent. \nI’d ceased feeling sleepy, but I was very tired and my legs were aching badly. And \nnow I realized that the silence of these people was telling on m y nerves. The only \nsound was a rather queer one; it came only now and then, and at first I was puzzled  \nby it. However, after listening  attentively, I guessed what it was; the old m en were \n 8\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nsucking at the insides of their cheeks, a nd this caused the odd, wheezing noi ses that \nhad m ystified me. They were so m uch abso rbed in their t houghts t hat they di dn’t \nknow what they were up to. I even had an im pression t hat the dead body in their \nmidst meant nothing at all to them. But now I suspect that I was mistaken about this. \nWe all drank the coffee, which the ke eper handed round.  After that, I can’t \nremember much; somehow the night  went by. I can recall only one moment; I had \nopened my eyes and I saw the old men sl eeping hunched up on their chairs, with one  \nexception. Resting his chin on his hands clas ped round his stick, he was staring hard \nat me, as if he had been waiting for m e to wake. Then I fell asleep again. I woke  up \nafter a bit, because the ache in my legs had developed into a sort of cramp. \nThere was a glimmer of dawn above the s kylight. A minute or two later one of the \nold men woke up and coughed repeatedly. He spat into a big check handkerchief, and \neach time he spat it sounded as if he were  retching. This woke the ot hers, and t he \nkeeper told them it was ti me to make a m ove. They all got up at once. Their faces  \nwere ashen gray aft er the long, uneasy vig il. To m y surprise each of them  shook \nhands with me, as though this night togeth er, in which we hadn’t exchanged a word, \nhad created a kind of intimacy between us. \nI was quite done in. The keeper took m e to his room, and I tidied m yself up a bit.  \nHe gave me some m ore “white” coffee, and it seemed to  do me good. When I went \nout, the sun was up and the sky mottled red above the hills between Marengo and the \nsea. A mo rning breeze was blowing and it ha d a pleasant s alty tang. There was t he \npromise of a very fine day. I hadn’t been in the country for ages, and I caught m yself \nthinking what an agreeable walk I could have had, if it hadn’t been for Mother. \nAs it was, I waited in the courtyard, under a plane tree. I sniffed the sm ells of the \ncool earth and found I wasn’t sleepy any more. Then I thought of the other fellows in \nthe office. At this hour they’d be getting up,  preparing to go to work; for me this was \nalways the worst hour of the day. I went on thinki ng, like this, for ten m inutes or so; \nthen the sound of a  bell insi de the buildin g attracted m y atte ntion. I could see \nmovements behind the windows; then all wa s calm again. The sun had risen a little  \nhigher and was beginning to warm  m y f eet. The keeper came across the yard and \nsaid the warden wis hed to see me. I went to his office and he got me to sign some \ndocument. I noticed that he was in black, w ith pin-stripe trousers. He picked up the \ntelephone receiver and looked at me. \n“The undertaker’s men arrive d some moments ago, and th ey will be going to the \nmortuary to screw down the coffin. Shall I te ll them to wait, for you to have a last \nglimpse of your mother?” \n“No,” I said. \nHe spoke into the receiver, lo wering his voice. “That’s all right, Figeac. Tell the \nmen to go there now.” \n 9\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nHe then inform ed me that he was going to  attend the funeral, and I thanked him . \nSitting down behind his desk, he crossed hi s short legs and leaned back. Besides the \nnurse on duty, he told me, he and I would be  the only mourners at the funeral. It was \na rule of the Hom e that inmates shoul dn’t attend funerals , though t here was no \nobjection to letting some of them sit up beside the coffin, the night before. \n“It’s for t heir own sakes,” he explained,  “to spare their feelings. But in this \nparticular instance I’ve given perm ission to an old friend of your m other to come \nwith us. His name is Thomas Pérez.” The warden smiled. “It’s a rather touching little \nstory in its way. He and you r mother had become al most inseparable. The other old \npeople used to tease Pérez about having a fiancée. ‘When are you goi ng to m arry \nher?’ they’d ask. He’d t urn it with a laugh. It  was a standing joke, in fact. So, as you \ncan guess, he feels very ba dly about your m other’s death. I thought  I couldn’t \ndecently refuse him permission to attend the funeral. But, o n our medical officer’s \nadvice, I forbade him to sit up beside the body last night.” \nFor some time we sat there without speaki ng. Then the warden got up and went to \nthe window. Presently he said: \n“Ah, there’s the padre from Marengo. He’s a bit ahead of time.” \nHe warned m e that it would t ake us a good three quarters of an hour, walking to  \nthe church, which was in the village. Then we went downstairs. \nThe priest was waiting just outside the m ortuary door. W ith him  were t wo \nacolytes, one of whom had a censer. The pr iest was stooping over him, adjusting the \nlength of t he silver chain on which it hung. When he saw us he straight ened up and \nsaid a few words to me, addressing m e as, “My son.” Then he led the way into the \nmortuary. \nI noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffi n and the \nscrews in the lid had now been driven home. At the same moment I heard the warden \nremark that the hearse had arrived, a nd the priest starting his prayers. Then \neverybody made a move. Holding a strip of black cloth, the four men approached the \ncoffin, while the priest, the boys, and myself  filed out. A lady I hadn’t seen before \nwas standing by the door. “Thi s is Monsi eur Meursault,” the warden said to her. I \ndidn’t catch her name, but I gathered she wa s a nursing sister attach ed to the Home. \nWhen I was introduced, she bowed, without  the trace of a sm ile on her long, gaunt \nface. We stood aside from the doorway to let the coffin by; then, following the  \nbearers down a corridor, we came to the fr ont entrance, where a hearse was waiting. \nOblong, glossy, varnished black all over, i t vaguely reminded me of the pen trays i n \nthe office. \nBeside the hearse stood a quaintly dressed little -m an, whose duty it was, I \nunderstood, to supervise the funeral, as a sort of master of ceremonies. Near him, \nlooking constrained, alm ost bashful, was ol d M. Pérez, my moth er’s special friend. \nHe wore a soft felt  hat with a puddin g-basin crown and a very wide brim —he \n 10\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwhisked it  off the m oment the coffin emerged from  the doorway—trousers that \nconcertina’d on his shoes, a black tie much too small for his high white double collar. \nUnder a bulbous, pimply nose, his lips were trembling. But what caught my attention \nmost was his ears; pendulous, scarlet ears that showed up like blobs of sealing wax \non the pallor of his cheeks and were framed in wisps of silky white hair. \nThe undertaker’s factotum  shepherded us to our places, with the priest in front of \nthe hearse, and the four men in black on each side of it. The warden and myself came \nnext, and, bringing up the rear, old Pérez and the nurse. \nThe sky was already a blaze of light, and the air stoking up rapidl y. I felt the first \nwaves of heat lapping m y back, and my da rk sui t made things worse. I couldn’t \nimagine why we waited so long for getting under way. Old Pérez, who had put on his \nhat, took i t off again. I had turned sligh tly in his di rection and was looking at him \nwhen the warden started tellin g me m ore about him. I remem ber his saying that old \nPérez and m y mother used oft en to have a longish stroll t ogether in the cool of the \nevening; sometim es they we nt as far as the village, accompanied by a nurse, of \ncourse. \nI looked at the countryside, at  the long lines of cypresses sl oping up t oward the \nskyline and the hills,  the hot re d soil dapp led with vivid green, and here and there a \nlonely house sharply outli ned against the light—and I could understa nd Mother’s \nfeelings. Evenings in these parts must be a sort of mournful sol ace. Now, in the full  \nglare of the m orning sun, with everythi ng shimmering in the  heat haze, there was \nsomething inhuman, discouraging, about this landscape. \nAt last we made a move. Only then I noticed that  Pérez had a slight limp. The old \nchap steadily lost ground as the hearse gain ed speed. One of the men beside it, too, \nfell back and drew level with me. I was surprised to see how quickl y the sun was \nclimbing up the sky, and just  then it struck me that for quite a  while the air had be en \nthrobbing with the hum  of insects and th e rustle of grass wa rming up. Sweat was \nrunning down my face. As I had no hat I tried to fan myself with my handkerchief. \nThe undertaker’s man turned t o me and said  something that I didn’t catch. At that  \nsame time he wiped the crown of his head w ith a handkerchief that he held in his left \nhand, while with his right he tilted up his hat. I asked him what he’d said. He pointed \nupward. \n“Sun’s pretty bad today, ain’t it?” \n“Yes,” I said. \nAfter a while he asked: “Is it your mother we’re burying?” \n“Yes,” I said again. \n“What was her age?” \n“Well, she was getting on.” As a m atter of fact, I didn’t know exactly how old she \nwas. \n 11\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nAfter that he kept silent. Looking back, I saw Pérez limping along some fifty yards \nbehind. He was swinging his big felt hat at arm ’s length, trying to make the pace. I \nalso had a look at the warden. He was wa lking with carefully m easured steps, \neconomizing every gesture. Beads of perspi ration glistened on his forehead, but he \ndidn’t wipe them off. \nI had an impression that our little procession was moving slightly faster. Wherever \nI looked I saw the same sun-drenched country side, and the sky was so dazzling that I \ndared not raise my eyes. Presently we st ruck a patch of freshly tarred road. A \nshimmer of heat played over it and one’s feet  squelched at each step, leaving bright \nblack gashes. In front, the coachman’s gl ossy black hat looked like a lum p of the \nsame sticky substa nce, poised above t he hearse. It gave one a que er, dream like \nimpression, that blue-white glare overhead and all this blackness round one: the sleek \nblack of the hearse, t he dull black of the me n’s clothes, and the silvery-black gashes \nin the road. And then there were the sm ells, smells of hot  leather and horse dung \nfrom the hearse, veined with whiffs of incense s moke. Wh at with these and th e \nhangover from a poor night’s sleep, I found my eyes and thoughts growing blurred. \nI looked back again. Pérez seemed very far away now, alm ost hidden by the heat \nhaze; then, abruptly, he di sappeared altogether. After puzzling over it for a b it, I \nguessed that he had turned off the road into the fields. Then I noticed that there was a \nbend of the road a little way ah ead. Obviously Pérez, who knew the district well, had  \ntaken a short cut, so as to catch up with us . He rejoined us soon after we were round \nthe bend; then began to lose ground agai n. He took another s hort cut  and met us \nagain farther on; in fact, this happened se veral times during the next half-hour. But \nsoon I lost interest in his m ovements; my temples were throbbing and I could hardly \ndrag myself along. \nAfter that everything went with a rush; and also with such precision and matter-of-\nfactness that I remember har dly any de tails. Ex cept that when we were on th e \noutskirts of the village the nurse said something to m e. Her voice took me by \nsurprise; it didn’t m atch her face at all; it was m usical and slightly trem ulous. What \nshe said was: “If you go too slowly there’s the risk of a heatstroke. But, if you go too \nfast, you perspire, and the cold air in th e church gives you a chill.” I saw her point; \neither way one was in for it. \nSome other memories of the funeral have  stuck in my mind. The old boy’s face,  \nfor instance, when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside the village. His \neyes were streaming with tears, of exha ustion or distress, or bot h t ogether. But \nbecause of the wrinkles they co uldn’t flow down. They spread out, crisscrossed, and \nformed a smooth gloss on the old, worn face. \nAnd I can  remem ber the look of the chur ch, the villagers in the street, the red  \ngeraniums on the graves, Pérez’s fainting fit—he crumpled up like a rag doll—the \ntawny-red earth pattering on Mother’s coffin, the bits of white roots mixed up with it; \n 12\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nthen m ore people, voices, the wait outside a caf é for the bus, the rumbl e of the \nengine, and my little thrill of pleasure wh en we entered the first brightly lit streets of \nAlgiers, and I pictured m yself going st raight to bed and sleeping twelve hours at  a \nstretch. \n \n 13"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nII \nON WAKING I understood why m y employer had looked rather cross when I asked \nfor my two days off; it’s a Saturday today. I hadn’t thought of this at the time; it only \nstruck me when I was getting out of bed. Obviously he had seen that it would mean \nmy getting four days’ holiday straight off,  and one couldn’t expect him t o like that. \nStill, for one thing, it wasn’t my fault if  Mother was buried yest erday and not today; \nand then, again, I’d have had m y Saturday and Sunday off i n any case. But naturally \nthis didn’t prevent me from seeing my employer’s point. \nGetting up was an effort, as I’d been r eally exhausted by the previous day’s \nexperiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the morning, and decided that \na swim would do me good. So I caught the streetcar that goes down to the harbor. \nIt was qui te like old tim es; a lot of young people were in t he swimming pool , \namongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at the office. I was rather keen \non her i n those days, and I fancy she liked me, too. But she was with us so short a \ntime that nothing came of it. \nWhile I was helping her to clim b on to a raft, I let my hand stray over her breasts. \nThen she lay flat on the raft, while I tr od water. After a moment she turned and  \nlooked at me. Her hair was over her eyes and she was laughing. I clambered up on to \nthe raft, b eside her. The air was pleas antly warm, and, half joki ngly, I let m y head \nsink back upon her l ap. She didn’t seem  to mind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky \nfull in my eyes, all blue and gold, and I could feel Marie’s stomach rising and falli ng \ngently under my head. We m ust have stayed a good half-hour on the raft, both of us \nhalf asleep. When the sun got t oo hot she dived off and I foll owed. I caught up wit h \nher, put my arm round her waist, and we swam side by side. She was still laughing. \nWhile we were drying oursel ves on the edge of the swimming pool she said: “I’m \nbrowner than you.” I asked he r if she’d com e to the movies  with me that evening. \nShe laughed again and said, “Yes,” if I’d take her to the comedy everybody was \ntalking about, the one with Fernandel in it. \nWhen we had dressed, she stared at my black tie and asked if I was in mourning. I \nexplained that my mother had died. “When?” she asked, and I said, “Yesterday.” She \nmade no rem ark, though I thought she  shrank away a little. I was just going to \nexplain to her that it wasn’t m y fault, but I checked mys elf, as I remembered having \nsaid the same thing to m y em ployer, and realizing then it  sounded rather fool ish. \nStill, foolish or not, somehow one can’t help feeling a bit guilty, I suppose. \nAnyhow, by evening Marie had forgotten all about it. The film was funny in parts, \nbut some of it was downright stupid. She pressed her leg against mine while we were \nin the picture house, and I was fondl ing he r breast. Toward the end of the show I \nkissed her, but rather clumsily. Afterward she came back with me to my place. \n 14\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nWhen I woke up, Marie had gone. She’d told  me her aunt expected her first thing \nin the morning. I remembered it was a Sunday,  and that put me o ff; I’ve never cared \nfor Sundays. So I turned m y head and lazily  sniffed the sm ell of brine that Marie’s \nhead had left on the pillow. I slept until ten.  After that I stayed in bed until noon, \nsmoking cigarettes. I decided not to lunch at  Céleste’s restaurant as I usually did; \nthey’d be sure to pester m e with questions, and I di slike being questioned. So I fried \nsome eggs and ate them  off the pan. I did without bread as there wasn’t any left, and \nI couldn’t be bothered going down to buy it. \nAfter lunch I felt at loose ends and roamed  about the little flat. It suited us well \nenough when Mother was with me, but now that I was by myself it was too large and \nI’d moved the dining table into m y bedroom. That was now the only room  I used; it  \nhad all the furniture I needed: a brass beds tead, a dressing table, so me cane ch airs \nwhose seats had m ore or less caved in, a wardrobe with a tarnished mirror. The rest \nof the flat was never used, so I didn’t trouble to look after it. \nA bit later, for want  of anyt hing better t o do, I pic ked up an old newspaper that \nwas lying on the floor and read it. There wa s an advertisement of Kruschen Salts and \nI cut it out and pasted in into an album wh ere I keep things th at amu se me in t he \npapers. Then I washed my hands and, as a last resource, went out on to the balcony. \nMy bedroom  overlooks the main street of our district. Though it  was a fine \nafternoon, the paving blocks were black and glistening. What few people were about \nseemed in an absurd hurry. First of all there came a fam ily, going for t heir Sunday-\nafternoon walk; two small boys in sailor suit s, with shor t t rousers hardly down to \ntheir knees, and looking rather uneasy in their Sunday best; then a little girl with a \nbig pink bow and black patent-leather s hoes. Behind them was their mother, an \nenormously fat wo man in a brown silk dr ess, and their father , a dapper little man , \nwhom I knew by sight. He had a straw hat, a walking stick, and a butterfly tie. Seeing \nhim beside his wife, I understood why peopl e said he came of a good fam ily and had \nmarried beneath him. \nNext came a group of young fellows, the local  “bloods,” with sleek oiled hair, red \nties, coats cut very tight at the waist, braided pockets, and s quare-toed shoes. I \nguessed they were going to one of the big theaters in the center of the town. That was \nwhy they had started out so early and were hurrying to th e streetcar stop, laughing \nand talking at the top of their voices. \nAfter they had passed, the street gradually  emptied. By this time all the matinees \nmust have begun. Only a few shopkeep ers and cats rem ained about. Above the \nsycamores bordering the road the sky was cloudless, but the light was soft. The \ntobacconist on the ot her side of the street brought a chair out on to the pavem ent in \nfront of his door and sat astride it, resting his arm s on the back. The streetcars which \na few m inutes before had been crowded we re now alm ost empty. In the little café, \n 15\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nChez Pierrot, beside the tobacconist’s, the waiter was sweeping up the sawdust in the \nempty restaurant. A typical Sunday afternoon. ... \nI turned my chair round and seat ed myse lf like the tobacconist, as it was more \ncomfortable that way. After sm oking a couple of cigarettes I went back to the room , \ngot a tablet of chocolate, and returned t o the window to eat it. Soon after, the sky \nclouded over, and I thought a summer stor m was com ing. However, the clouds \ngradually lifted. All the same, they had left in  the street a sort of threat of rain, which \nmade it darker. I stayed watching the sky for quite a while. \nAt five there was a loud clanging of streetcars. They were com ing from  the \nstadium in our suburb where there had been a football match. Even the back  \nplatforms were crowded and people were standing on the steps. Then another \nstreetcar brought back the teams. I knew th ey were the players by the little suitcase \neach m an carried. They were bawling out their te am song, “Keep the ball rolli ng, \nboys.” One of them looked up at me an d shouted, “We licked them !” I waved my \nhand and called back, “Good work!” From  now on there was a steady stream  of \nprivate cars. \nThe sky had changed again; a reddish  glow was spreading up beyond the \nhousetops. As dusk set in, the street grew more crowded. People were returning from \ntheir walks, and I noticed the dapper little man with the fat wife amongst the passers-\nby. Children were whim pering and trail ing w earily after their parents.  After some \nminutes the local picture houses disgorge d their audiences. I noticed that the young  \nfellows coming from them were taking longe r strides and gesturing m ore vigorously \nthan at ordinary times; doubtless the picture they’d been seeing was of the wild-West \nvariety. Those who had been t o the picture houses in the middle of the town came a \nlittle later, and looked m ore sedate, though a few were still laughing. On the whole, \nhowever, they seemed languid and exhausted. Some of th em rem ained loitering in \nthe street under m y window. A group of girls came by, walking arm  in arm . The \nyoung m en under m y window swerved so as  t o brush against them, and shouted \nhumorous rem arks, which m ade the girls tu rn thei r heads and giggle. I recognized \nthem as gi rls from  m y part of the t own, and two or t hree of them , whom  I knew, \nlooked up and waved to me. \nJust then the street l amps came on, all to gether, and they made the star s that were \nbeginning to glimmer in the night sky pa ler still. I felt m y eyes getting tired, what  \nwith the lights and all the movement I’d been watching in the street. There were little \npools of brightness under the lamps, and now and then a streetcar passed, lighting up \na girl’s hair, or a smile, or a silver bangle. \nSoon after this, as the str eetcars became fewer and the sky showed velvety black \nabove the trees and lamps, the street grew emptier, almost imperceptibly, until a time \ncame when there was nobody t o be seen and a cat, the first of th e evening, crossed, \nunhurrying, the deserted street. \n 16\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nIt struck me that I’d better see about so me dinner. I had been leaning so long on \nthe back of m y chair, looking down, that my neck hurt when I straight ened myself \nup. I went down, bought some bread and spaghetti, did my cooking, and ate my meal \nstanding. I’d intended to sm oke another ci garette at m y window, but the night had \nturned rather chilly and I decided against it. As I was coming back, after shutting the \nwindow, I glanced at  the mirror and saw reflect ed in it a corner of  my table with my  \nspirit lamp and some bits of bread beside it. It occurred to me that som ehow I’d got \nthrough another Sunday, that Mother now  was buried, and tom orrow I’d be going \nback to work as usual. Really, nothing in my life had changed. \n 17\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nIII \nI HAD a busy m orning in the office. My employer was in a good hum or. He even \ninquired if I wasn’t t oo tired, and followed it up by asking what Mother’s age was. I \nthought a bit, then answered, “Round about  sixt y,” as I didn’t want  to make a \nblunder. At which he looke d relieved—why, I can’t imag ine—and seemed to thi nk \nthat closed the matter. \nThere was a pile of bills of la ding waiting on m y desk, and I had to go through \nthem all. Before leaving for lunch I washed my hands. I always enjoyed doing this at  \nmidday. In the evening it was less pleasant, as the roller towel, after being used by so \nmany people, was soppi ng wet. I once brought this to m y employer’s notice. It w as \nregrettable, he agreed—but, to his m ind, a mere d etail. I left the office building a \nlittle later than usual, at h alf-past tw elve, with Emmanuel, who works in th e \nForwarding Department. Our building overl ooks the sea, and we paused for a \nmoment on the steps to look at the shippi ng in the. harbor. The sun was scorching \nhot. Just t hen a big truck came up, with  a din of chains and backfires from  the \nengine, and Emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it. I started to run. The truck \nwas well away, and we had to chase it for qui te a distance. W hat with the heat an d \nthe noise from the engine, I felt half dazed. All I was conscious of was our mad rush \nalong the water front, amongst cranes and winches, with dark hulls of ships alongside \nand masts swaying in the offing. I was the first to catch up with the truck. I took a \nflying jump, landed safely, and helped Emmanuel to scramble in beside me. We were \nboth of us out of breath, and the bumps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made \nthings worse. Emmanuel chuckled, and panted in my ear, “We’ve made it!” \nBy the time we reach ed Céleste’s restaurant we were dripping with sweat. Céleste \nwas at his usual place beside the entrance, with his apron bulging on his paunch, his  \nwhite mustache well to the fo re. When he saw me he wa s sympathetic and “hoped I \nwasn’t feeling t oo badly.” I said, “No,” but I was extrem ely hungry.  I ate very \nquickly and had some coffee to  finish up. Then I went to  my place and took a short \nnap, as I’d drunk a glass of wine too many. \nWhen I woke I sm oked a cigarette before getting off m y bed. I was a bit late and  \nhad to run for the street car. The office was s tifling, and I was kept  hard at it all the \nafternoon. So it came as a relief when we  closed down and I was stroll ing sl owly \nalong the wharves in the cool ness. The sky was green, and it was pleasant to be out-\nof-doors after the stuffy office.  However, I went straight hom e, as I had to put som e \npotatoes on to boil. \nThe hall was dark and, when I was starting up t he stairs, I almost bumped into old \nSalamano, who lived on the same floor as I.  As usual, he had his dog with him . For \neight years the two had been inseparable.  Salamano’s spaniel is an ugly brute, \n 18"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nafflicted with some skin disease—mange, I suspect; anyhow, it has lost all its hair \nand its body is covered with brown scabs. Perhaps through living in one small room,  \ncooped up with his dog, Salama no has com e to resem ble it. His towy hair has gone \nvery thin, and he has reddish blotches  on his face. And the dog has developed \nsomething of its m aster’s queer hunched-up  gait; it always has its m uzzle stretched \nfar forward and its nose to the ground. Bu t, oddly enough, though so m uch alike, \nthey detest each other. \nTwice a day, at elev en and six, the ol d fellow takes his dog for a walk, and for \neight years that walk has never varied. You can see them in the rue de Lyon, the dog  \npulling his master along as hard as he can, till finally the old chap m isses a step and \nnearly falls. Then he beats his dog and calls it names. The dog cow ers and lags \nbehind, and it’s his master’s turn to dra g him along. Presently the dog forgets, st arts \ntugging at the leash again, gets another hi ding and more abuse. Then they halt on the \npavement, the pair of them, and glare at each other; the dog with terror and the man \nwith hatred in his eyes. Every time they’re  out, this happens. When the dog wants to \nstop at a l amppost, the old boy won’t le t him, and drags hi m on, and the wretched \nspaniel leaves behind him  a trail of little drops. But, if he  does it in the room, it \nmeans another hiding. \nIt’s been going on li ke this for eight year s, and Céleste always says it’s a “crying \nshame,” and something should be done about it; but really one can’t be sure. When I \nmet him in the hall, Salamano was bawling at his dog, calling him a bastard, a lousy \nmongrel, and so fort h, and the dog was whin ing. I said, “Good evening,” but the old \nfellow took no notice and went on cursing. So I thought I’d ask him what the dog had \ndone. Again, he didn’t answer, but went on shouting, “You bloody cur!” and the rest \nof it. I couldn’t  see very clearly, but he se emed to be fixing something on the dog’s \ncollar. I raised m y voice a little. Without lo oking round, he m umbled in a sort of \nsuppressed fury: “He’s always in the way, blast him! ” Then he started up the stai rs, \nbut the dog tried to resist and flattened itsel f out on the floor, so he had to haul it up \non the leash, step by step. \nJust then another man who lives on my floor came in from  the street. The general \nidea hereabouts is that he’s a pimp. But if you ask him what his job is, he says he’s a \nwarehouseman. One thing’s sure: he isn’t popu lar in our street. Still, he often has a \nword for me, and drops i n sometimes for a short talk in m y room, because I listen to \nhim. As a m atter of fact, I find what he says quite interesting. So, really I’ve no  \nreason for freezing him  off. His name is Sintès; Ray mond Sintès. He’s short and \nthick-set, has a nose like a boxer’s, and alwa ys dresses very sprucely. He, too, once \nsaid to m e, referring to Salamano, that it  was “a damn ed shame,” and asked me if I \nwasn’t disgusted by the way the old man served his dog. I answered: “No.” \nWe went up the stairs together, Sintès and I, and when I was turning in at my door, \nhe said: \n 19\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \n“Look here! How about havi ng som e gr ub wit h me? I’ve a black puddi ng and \nsome wine.” \nIt struck me that this would sa ve my having to cook my dinner, so I said, “Thanks \nvery much.” \nHe, too, has only one room , and a little kitchen without a window. I saw a pink-\nand-white plaster angel above  his bed, and som e photos of sporting champions and \nnaked girls pinned to the opposite wall. The bed hadn’t been made and the room was \ndirty. He began by lighting a paraffin lamp; then fumbled in his pocket and produced \na rather grimy bandage, which he wrapped round his right hand. I asked him what the \ntrouble was. He told m e he’d been  having a roughhouse w ith a fellow who’d \nannoyed him. \n“I’m not one who looks for trouble,” he e xplained, “only I’m a bit short-tempered. \nThat fellow said to me, challenging-like, ‘C ome down off that streetcar, if you’re a \nman.’ I says, ‘You keep quiet, I ain’t done nothing to you.’ Then he said I hadn’t any \nguts. Well, that settled it. I got down off the streetcar and I said to him , ‘You better \nkeep your mouth shut, or I’ll shut it for you.’ ‘I’d like to see you try!’ says he. Then I \ngave him one across the face, and laid him out good and pr oper. After a bit I started \nto help him get up, but all he did was to ki ck at me from where he lay. So I gave him \none with m y knee and a couple m ore swipes. He was bleeding like a pig when I’d \ndone with him. I asked him if he’d had enough, and he said, ‘Yes.’ ” \nSintès was busy fixing his bandage while he talked, and I was sitting on the bed. \n“So you see,” he said, “it wasn’t my fault; he was asking for it, wasn’t he?” \nI nodded, and he added: \n“As a matter of fact, I rather want to  ask your advice about som ething; it ’s \nconnected with this business. You’ve knoc ked about the world a bit, and I daresay \nyou can help m e. And then I’l l be your pal for life; I never forg et anyone who does \nme a good turn.” \nWhen I made no comment, he asked me if I’d like us to be pals. I replied that I had \nno objection, and that appeared to satisfy  him. He got out t he black pudding, cooked \nit in a frying pan, then laid the table, putting out two bottles of wine. While he was \ndoing this he didn’t speak. \nWe started dinner, and then he began telling me the whole story, hesitating a bit at \nfirst. \n“There’s a girl behind it—as usual. We slept together pretty regular. I was keeping \nher, as a matter of fact, and she cost me  a tidy sum. That fellow I knocked down is \nher brother.” \nNoticing that I said nothi ng, he added th at he knew what the neighbors said about \nhim, but it was a filthy lie. He had his pr inciples like everybody else, and a job in a \nwarehouse. \n 20\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \n“Well,” he said, “to go on with my story ... I found out one day that she was letting \nme down.” He gave her enough m oney to keep her goi ng, without extravagance, \nthough; he paid the rent of her room  and twenty francs a day for food. “Three \nhundred francs for rent, and six hundred for he r grub, with a little present thrown in \nnow and t hen, a pair of stocki ngs or wh atnot. Say, a thousand francs a m onth. But \nthat wasn’t enough for m y fine lady; she was always grum bling that she couldn’t \nmake both ends meet with what I gave her. So one day I says to her, ‘Look here, why \nnot get a job for a few hours a day? That’d make things easier for m e, too. I bought \nyou a new dress this m onth, I pay your rent and gi ve you twenty francs a day. But \nyou go and waste your m oney at the café with a pack of girl s. You give them  coffee \nand sugar.  And, of course , the m oney comes out of m y pocket. I treat you on t he \nsquare, and that’s how you pay me back.’ Bu t she wouldn’t hear of working, though \nshe kept on saying she couldn’t make do with  what I gave her. And then one day I \nfound out she was doing me dirt.” \nHe went on to explain that he’d found a  lottery ticket in her bag, and, when he \nasked where the m oney’d come from to buy it, she wouldn’t t ell him. Then, another \ntime, he’d found a pawn ticket for two bracelets that he’d never set eyes on. \n“So I knew there was dirty work going on, and I told her I’d have nothing more to \ndo with her. But, first, I gave her a good hiding, and I t old her som e home truths. I \nsaid that there was only one thing interest ed her and that was getting into bed with \nmen whenever she’d the chance. And I warned her straight, ‘You’ll be sorry one day, \nmy girl, and wish you’d got me back. All th e girls in the street, they ’re jealous of  \nyour luck in having me to keep you.’ ” \nHe’d beaten her till the blood came. Before th at he’d never beaten her. “Well, not \nhard, anyhow; onl y affectionately-like. Sh e’d howl a bit, and I had to shut t he \nwindow. Then, of course, it ended as per us ual. But this time I’m done with her. \nOnly, to my mind, I ain’t punished her enough. See what I mean?” \nHe explained that it  was about this he wanted m y advice. The lam p was smoking, \nand he stopped pacing up and down the  room , to lower the wick. I just listened, \nwithout speaking. I’d had a whole bottle of wine to myself and my head was buzzing. \nAs I’d used up my cigarettes I was smoking Raymond’s. Some late streetcars passed, \nand the last noi ses of the st reet died off with them. Raymond went on ta lking. What \nbored him was that he had “a sort of lech  on her” as he called it. But he was quite \ndetermined to teach her a lesson. \nHis first i dea, he said, had been to take her to a hotel, and then call in the special \npolice. He’d persuade them  to put her on the register as a “co mmon prostitute,” and  \nthat would make her wild. Then he’d looked up som e friends of his in the \nunderworld, fellows who kept tarts for what they could m ake out of them, but they \nhad practically nothing to sugges t. Still, as he pointed out, that sort of thing should \nhave been right  up t heir street; what’s t he good of being i n that line if you don’t \n 21\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nknow how to treat a girl who’s let you down? When he told them that, they suggested \nhe should “brand” her. But that wasn’t what he wanted, either. It would need a lot of \nthinking out. ... But, first, he’d like to ask me somet hing. Before he asked it, though, \nhe’d like to have my opinion of the story he’d been telling, in a general way. \nI said I hadn’t any, but I’d found it interesting. \nDid I think she really had done him dirt? \nI had to admit it looked like that. Then he asked me if I didn’t t hink she should be \npunished and what I’d do if I were in his s hoes. I told him  one could never be quite \nsure how to act in such cases, but I quite understood his wanting her to suffer for it. \nI drank some m ore wine, while Ray mond lit another ciga rette and began \nexplaining what he proposed t o do. He want ed to write her a lette r, “a real stinker, \nthat’ll get her on the raw,” and at the same time make her repent of what she’d done. \nThen, when she came back, he’d go to bed with her and, just when she was “properly \nprimed up,” he’d spit in he r face and throw her out of th e room. I agreed it wasn’t a \nbad plan; it would punish her, all right. \nBut, Raym ond told me, he didn’t feel up to writ ing the ki nd of lette r that was \nneeded, and that was where I could help. Wh en I didn’t say anything, he asked me if \nI’d mind doing it right away, and I said, “No,” I’d have a shot at it. \nHe drank off a glass of wine and stood up. Then he pushed aside the plates and the \nbit of cold pudding t hat was left, to m ake room on the table. After carefully wipi ng \nthe oilcloth, he got a sheet of squared pa per from the drawer of his bedside table; \nafter that, an envelope, a small red woode n penholder, and a square inkpot wit h \npurple ink in it. The moment he mentioned the girl’s name I knew she was a Moor. \nI wrote the letter. I didn’t take m uch tr ouble over it, but  I wanted to satisfy \nRaymond, as I’d no reason not to satisfy hi m. Then I read out what I’d written. \nPuffing at his cigarette, he listened, nodding now and then. “Read it agai n, please,” \nhe said. He seemed delighted. “That’s the stuff,” he chuckled. “I could tell you was a \nbrainy sort, old boy, and you know what’s what.” \nAt first I hardly noticed that “old boy.” It came back to me when he slapped me on \nthe shoulder and said, “So now we’re pals, ai n’t we?” I kept silence and he said it \nagain. I didn’t care one way or the other, but as he seemed so  set on it, I nodded and \nsaid, “Yes.” \nHe put the letter into the envelope and we  finished off the wine. Then both of us \nsmoked for some minutes, without speaking. The street was quite quiet, except when \nnow and again a car passed. Finally, I remarked that it was getting late, an d \nRaymond agreed. “Time’s gone m ighty fast th is evening,” he added, and in a way \nthat was true. I wanted to be in bed, only it was such an effort making a move. I must \nhave looked tired, for Raym ond said to me , “You mustn’t let things get  you down.” \nAt first I didn’t catch his m eaning. Then he explained that he  had heard of my \n 22\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nmother’s death; anyhow, he said, that wa s something bound to happen one day or \nanother. I appreciated that, and told him so. \nWhen I rose, Raym ond shook hands very warmly, remarking t hat men always \nunderstood each other. After  closing th e door behind m e I lingered for some \nmoments on the landing. The whole buil ding was as quiet as the grave, a dank, dark  \nsmell risi ng from  the well hole of t he stai rs. I could hear not hing but t he bl ood \nthrobbing in my ears, and for a while I st ood still, listening to it. Then the dog began \nto m oan in old Salamano’s room , a nd through the sleep-bound house the little  \nplaintive sound rose slowly, like a fl ower growing out  of the si lence and the \ndarkness. \n 23\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nIV \nI HAD a busy tim e in the office throughout the week. Ray mond dropped in once to \ntell m e he’d sent off the le tter. I went to the pictures  twice with Emmanuel, who \ndoesn’t always understand what’s happening on the screen a nd asks me to explain it. \nYesterday was Satu rday, and Marie came as we’d arranged.  She had a very pretty \ndress, with red and white stripes, and leather sandals, and I couldn’t take my eyes off \nher. One could see the outline of her fi rm little breasts, and her sun-tanned face was  \nlike a velvety brow n flower. We took the bus and went to a beach I know, some \nmiles out of Algiers.  It’s just a strip of sand between two rocky spurs, with a line of \nrushes at the back, along the tide line. At four o’clock the sun wasn’t too hot, but t he \nwater was pleasantly tepid, and small, languid ripples were creeping up the sand. \nMarie taught me a new game. The idea was,  while one swam, to suck in the spray \noff the waves and, when one’s mouth was full of foam, to lie on one’s back and spout \nit out against the sky. It made a sort of frothy haze that melted into the air or fell back \nin a war m shower on one’s cheeks. But ve ry soon m y mouth was smarting with all \nthe salt I’d drawn in; then Marie came up and hugged m e in the water, and pressed \nher mouth to mine. Her tongue cooled my lips, and we let the waves roll us about for \na minute or two before swimming back to the beach. \nWhen we had finished dressing, Mari e looked hard at me . Her eyes were \nsparkling. I kissed her; after that neither of us spoke for quite a while. I pressed her to \nmy side as we scram bled up th e foreshore. Both of us were in a hurry to catch th e \nbus, get back to my place, and tumble on to the bed. I’d left m y window open, and it \nwas pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies. \nMarie said she was free next m orning, so  I proposed she should have luncheon \nwith me. She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my way back I heard a \nwoman’s voice in Raym ond’s room. A little la ter old Salamano started grum bling at \nhis dog and presently there was a sound of boot s and paws on the wooden stairs; \nthen, “Filthy brute! Get on, yo u cur!” and the two of them went out into the street. I \ntold Marie about the old man’s habits, and it made her laugh. She was wearing one of \nmy pajama suits, and had t he sleeves ro lled up. When she laughed I wanted her \nagain. A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that so rt of question had no \nmeaning, really; but I supposed I didn’t. Sh e looked sad for a bit, but when we were \ngetting our lunch ready she bri ghtened up and started laughing, and when she laughs \nI always want to kiss her. It was just then that the row started in Raymond’s room. \nFirst we heard a woman saying som ething in a high-pitched voi ce; then Raymond \nbawling at her, “You let me down, you bitch! I’ll learn you to let me down!” There \ncame some thuds, then a piercing scream —it made one’s bl ood run col d—and in a \nmoment there was a crowd of people on the landing. Marie and I went out to see. The \n 24\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwoman was still scream ing and Raymond s till knocking her about.  Marie said, \nwasn’t it horri ble! I didn’t answer anything.  Then she asked me to go and fetch a \npoliceman, but I told her I didn’t like police men. However, one tu rned up presently; \nthe lodger on the second floor, a plum ber, came up, with him. When he banged on \nthe door the noise stopped inside the room. He knocked again, and, after a m oment, \nthe wom an started crying, and Raym ond opened the door. He  had a cigarette \ndangling from his underlip and a rather sickly smile. \n“Your name?” Raymond gave his name. “Tak e that cigarette out of your m outh \nwhen you’re talking to me,” the policeman said gruffly. Raymond hesitated, glanced \nat me, and kept the cigare tte in his m outh. The policeman prom ptly swung his arm \nand gave him  a good hard smack  on the left cheek. The cigarette shot from  his lips \nand dropped a yard away. Raymond made a wry face, but said nothing for a moment. \nThen in a humble tone he asked if he mightn’t pick up his cigarette. \nThe officer said, “Y es,” and added: “But don’t you forget next  time that we don’t \nstand for any nonsense, not from guys like you.” \nMeanwhile the girl went on sobbing and repeating: “He hit me, the coward. He’s a \npimp.” \n“Excuse me, officer,” Raym ond put in, “but is that in order, calling a man a pimp \nin the presence of witnesses?” \nThe policeman told him to shut his trap. \nRaymond then turned to the girl. “Don’t you worry, my pet. We’ll meet again.” \n“That’s enough,” the policeman said, and told the girl to go away. Raym ond was \nto stay in his room till summoned to the police station. “You ought to be ashamed of \nyourself,” the policeman added, “getting so tight you can’t stand steady. Why, you’re \nshaking all over!” \n“I’m not tight,” Raym ond explained. “Only when I see you standing t here and \nlooking at me, I can’t help trembling. That’s only natural.” \nThen he closed his door, and we all went  away. Marie and I finished getting our \nlunch ready. But she hadn’t any appetite, and I ate nearly all. She left at one, and then \nI had a nap. \nToward three there was a knock at m y door and Raym ond came in. He sat down \non the edge of m y bed and for a m inute or two said nothi ng. I asked him how it had \ngone off. He said it had all gone quite sm oothly at fi rst, as per progra m; only then \nshe’d slapped his face and he’d seen red, and started thrashing her. As for what  \nhappened after that, he needn’t tell me, as I was there. \n“Well,” I said, “you taught her a lesson, all right, and that’s what you wanted, isn’t \nit?” \nHe agreed, and pointed out that whatever the police did, that wouldn’t change th e \nfact she’d had her punishm ent. As for the police, he knew exactly how to handle \n 25\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nthem. But he’d like  to know  if I’d expected him to return the blow when the \npoliceman hit him. \nI told him I hadn’t e xpected anything whatsoever and, anyhow, I had no use for \nthe police. Raym ond seemed pleased and asked if I’d li ke to com e out for a strol l \nwith him. I got up from  the bed and start ed brushing m y hair. Then Raym ond said \nthat what he really wanted was for me to  act as his witness. I told him  I had no \nobjection; only I didn’t know what he expected me to say. \n“It’s quite sim ple,” he rep lied. “You’ve only got t o tell them that the girl had let \nme down.” \nSo I agreed to be his witness. \nWe went out together, a nd Raymond stood me a brandy in  a café. Then we had a \ngame of billiards; it was a close game an d I lost by only a few points. After that he \nproposed going to a  brothel, but I refused; I didn’t feel like it. As we were walk ing \nslowly back he tol d me how pleased he  was at having paid out his m istress so \nsatisfactorily. He made him self extremely amiable to m e, and I quite enjoyed our \nwalk. \nWhen we were nearly hom e I saw old Sal amano on the doorst ep; he seemed very \nexcited. I noticed that his dog wasn’t w ith him . He was turning like  a teetotum, \nlooking in all directions, and sometimes peering into the darkness of the hall with his \nlittle bloodshot eyes. Then he’d m utter something to him self and start gazing up and  \ndown the street again. \nRaymond asked him what was wrong, but he didn’t answer at once. Then I heard \nhim grunt, “The bastard! The filthy cur!” When I a sked him where his dog was, he \nscowled at me and snapped out, “Gone!” A m oment late r, all of a sudden, he \nlaunched out into it. \n“I’d taken him to the Parade Ground as us ual. There was a fair on, and you coul d \nhardly move for the  crowd. I stopped at one of t he booths t o look at t he Handcuff \nKing. When I turned to go, the dog was gone. I’d been meaning to get a sm aller \ncollar, but I never thought the brute could slip it and get away like that.” \nRaymond assured hi m the dog would find its  way hom e, and told him  stories of \ndogs that had traveled m iles and m iles to ge t back to their m asters. But this seemed \nto make the old fellow even more worried than before. \n“Don’t you understa nd, they’ll  do away with him; the police, I mean. It’s not \nlikely anyone will take him  in and look after him ; with all those scabs he puts \neverybody off.” \nI told him that there was a pound at t he police station, where stray dogs are taken. \nHis dog was certain to be t here and he could get it back on paym ent of a small \ncharge. He asked me how m uch the charge was, but there I couldn’t help him. Then \nhe flew into a rage again. \n 26\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \n“Is it likely I’d give m oney for a m utt like that? No dam ned fear! They can kill \nhim, for all I care.” And he went on calling his dog the usual names. \nRaymond gave a laugh and turned into t he hall. I followed him  upstairs, and we \nparted on the landing. A m inute or two later I heard Salam ano’s footsteps and a \nknock on my door. \nWhen I opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway. \n“Excuse me ... I hope I’m not disturbing you.” \nI asked him in, but he shook his head. He  was staring at his toe caps, and the \ngnarled old hands were trembling. Without meeting my eyes, he started talking. \n“They won’t really take him from me, will they, Monsieur Meursault? Surely they \nwouldn’t do a thing like that. If they do—I don’t know what will become of me.” \nI told him that, so far as I knew, they kept stray dogs in the pound for three days, \nwaiting for their owners to call for them . After that they disposed of the dogs as they \nthought fit. \nHe stared at me in si lence for a m oment, then said, “Good eve ning.” After that I \nheard him pacing up and down his room  for quite a while. Then his bed creaked. \nThrough the wall there came to me a little wheezing sound, and I guessed that he was \nweeping. For some reason, I don’t know what, I began thinking of Mother. But I had \nto get up early next day; so, as I wasn’t  feeling hungry, I did without  supper, and \nwent straight to bed. \n 27"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nV \nRAYMOND rang me up at the office. He said  that a friend of his—t o whom he’d \nspoken about m e—invited m e to spend ne xt Sunday at his little seaside bungalow \njust outside Algiers. I told him I’d have been delighted; only I had promised to spend \nSunday with a girl. Raym ond promptly replied that she could com e, too. In fact, his \nfriend’s wife would be very pleased not to be the only woman in a party of men. \nI’d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesn’t approve of my using the \noffice phone for private calls . But Raymond asked me to hold on; he had something \nelse to tell m e, and that was why he’d rung me up, though he could have waited till \nthe evening to pass on the invitation. \n“It’s like this,” he said. “I’ve been sh adowed all the morning by some Arabs. One \nof them’s the brother of that girl I had the row with. If you see him hanging round the \nhouse when you come back, pass me the word.” \nI promised to do so. \nJust then m y employer sent for m e. For a moment I felt uneasy, as I expected h e \nwas going to tell me to stick to m y work and not waste tim e chattering with friends \nover the phone. However, it was nothing of the kind. He wanted to discuss a project \nhe had in view, though so far he’d com e to no decision. It was to open a branch at \nParis, so as to be able to deal with the big com panies on the spot, wit hout posta l \ndelays, and he wanted to know if I’d like a post there. \n“You’re a young m an,” he said , “and I’m  pretty sure you’ d enjoy li ving in Paris. \nAnd, of course, you could travel about France for some months in the year.” \nI told him I was quite prepared to go; but really I didn’t care much one way or the \nother. \nHe then asked if a “change of life,” as he called  it, didn’t appeal to m e, and I \nanswered that one never changed his way of life; one life was as good as another, and \nmy present one suited me quite well. \nAt this he looked rather hurt, and told me  that I always shilly-shallied,  and that I \nlacked ambition—a grave defect, to his mind, when one was in business. \nI returned to m y work. I’d have preferre d not to vex him , but I saw no reason for \n“changing my life.” By and large it wasn’t an unpl easant one. As a student I’d had \nplenty of ambition of the ki nd he meant. Bu t, when I had t o drop my studies, I very \nsoon realized all that was pretty futile. \nMarie came that evening and asked me if I’d  marry her. I said I didn’t mind; if she \nwas keen on it, we’d get married. \nThen she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before, that her question \nmeant nothing or next to nothing—but I supposed I didn’t. \n“If that’s how you feel,” she said, “why marry me?” \n 28\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI explained that i t had no im portance really, but, if it would give her pl easure, we \ncould get married right away. I poi nted out that, anyhow, the suggesti on came from \nher; as for me, I’d merely said, “Yes.” \nThen she remarked that marriage was a serious matter. \nTo which I answered: “No.” \nShe kept silent after that, staring at me in a curious way. Then she asked: \n“Suppose another girl had asked you to ma rry her—I mean, a girl you liked in the \nsame way as you like me—would you have said ‘Yes’ to her, too?” \n“Naturally.” \nThen she said she wondered if she really loved me or not. I, of course, couldn’t  \nenlighten her as to that. And, after anot her silence, she m urmured something about \nmy being “a queer fellow.” “And I daresay that’s why I love you,” she added. “But \nmaybe that’s why one day I’ll come to hate you.” \nTo which I had nothing to say, so I said nothing. \nShe thought for a bi t, then started sm iling and, taking m y arm, repeated that she \nwas in earnest; she really wanted to marry me. \n“All right,” I answered. “We’ll get m arried whenever you like .” I then mentioned \nthe proposal made by my employer, and Marie said she’d love to go to Paris. \nWhen I told her I’d lived in Paris for a while, she asked me what it was like. \n“A dingy sort of town, to m y mind. Masses of pigeons and dark court yards. And \nthe people have washed-out, white faces.” \nThen we went for a walk all the way ac ross the town by the main streets. The \nwomen were good-l ookers, and I asked Marie if she, too, noticed this. She said, \n“Yes,” and that she saw what I meant. Af ter that we said not hing for some m inutes. \nHowever, as I di dn’t want her to leave me , I suggested we should dine together at \nCéleste’s. She’d have loved to dine w ith me, she said, only she was booked up for \nthe evening. We were near my place, and I said, “Au revoir, then.” \nShe looked me in the eyes. \n“Don’t you want to know what I’m doing this evening?” \nI did want to know, but I hadn’t though t of asking her, and I guessed she was \nmaking a grievance of it. I must have looked em barrassed, for suddenl y she started \nlaughing and bent toward me, pouting her lips for a kiss. \nI went by m yself to Céleste’s. When I ha d just start ed my dinner an odd-looking \nlittle woman came in and asked if she might sit at my table. Of course she might. She \nhad a chubby face like a ripe apple, bright eyes, and moved in a curiously jerky way, \nas if she were on wires. After taking o ff her closefitting jacket she sat down an d \nstarted studying the bill of fare with a sort  of rapt attention. Then she called Céleste \nand gave her order, very fast but quite distinctly; one didn’t lose a word. While \nwaiting for the hors d’oeuvre she opened her bag, took out  a slip of paper and a \npencil, and added up the bill in advance. Diving into her bag again, she produced a \n 29\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \npurse and took from  it the exact sum , plus a small tip, and pla ced it on t he cloth in \nfront of her. \nJust then the waiter brought the hors d’oe uvre, which she proceeded to wolf down \nvoraciously. While waiting for the next cour se, she produced another pencil, this \ntime a blue one, from  her ba g, and the radio mag azine for the co ming week, an d \nstarted making ticks against alm ost all the items of the daily program s. There were a \ndozen pages in the magazine, and she c ontinued studyi ng them  closely throughout  \nthe meal. When I’d finished m ine she wa s still ticking off item s with the same \nmeticulous attention. Then she rose, put on her jacket again with the same abrupt, \nrobot-like gestures, and walked briskly out of the restaurant. \nHaving nothing better to do, I followed her for a short distance. Keeping on the  \ncurb of the pavement, she walked straig ht ahead, never swerving or l ooking ba ck, \nand it was extraordinary how fast she cove red the ground, considering her sm allness. \nIn fact, the pace was too m uch for m e, and I soon lost sight of her and turned back \nhomeward. For a moment the “little robot” (as I thought of he r) had much impressed \nme, but I soon forgot about her. \nAs I was turning in at my door I ran into old Salamano. I asked him into my room, \nand he inform ed me that his dog was defi nitely lost. He’d been to the pound to \ninquire, but it wasn’t there, and the sta ff told hi m it had probabl y been run over. \nWhen he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about it at the police station, \nthey said the police had m ore important things to attend to than keeping records of \nstray dogs run over in t he st reets. I su ggested he shoul d ge t another dog, but, \nreasonably enough, he pointed out that he’d become used to this one, and it wouldn’t \nbe the same thing. \nI was seated on m y bed, with m y legs  up, and Salamano on a chair beside the  \ntable, facing m e, his hands spread on his knees. He had kept on his battered felt hat \nand was mumbling away behind his draggled yellowish mustache. I found him rather \nboring, but I had not hing to do  and didn’t feel sleepy. So , to keep the conversation \ngoing, I asked som e questions about his dog— how long he had had it  and so fort h. \nHe told me he had g ot it soon after his wife’s  death. He’d m arried rather late in life. \nWhen a young m an, he wanted to go on th e stage; during his m ilitary service he’d \noften played in the regim ental theatricals and acted rather well, so everybody sai d. \nHowever, finally, he had taken a job in the railway, and he didn’t regret it, as now he \nhad a sm all pension. He and his wife had never hit it off very well, but they’d got \nused to each other, and when she died he felt lonely. One of his mates on the railway  \nwhose bit ch had just had pups had offe red him one, and he had taken it, as a \ncompanion. He’d had to feed it from  the bottle at first. But, as a dog’s life is shorter \nthan a man’s, they’d grown old together, so to speak. \n“He was a cantankerous brut e,” Salama no said. “Now and then we had some \nproper set-tos, he and I. But he was a good mutt all the same.” \n 30\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old man. \n“Ah, but you should have seen him  be fore his illness!” he said. “He had a  \nwonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point , really. I tried hard to cure  him; every \nmortal night after he got that  skin dise ase I rubbed an oint ment in. But his real \ntrouble was old age, and there’s no curing that.” \nJust then I yawned, and the ol d man said he’d better make a m ove. I told him  he \ncould stay, and that I was sorry about what  had happened to his dog. He thanked me, \nand mentioned that m y mother had been very  fond of hi s dog. He referred to her as \n“your poor mother,” and was afraid I m ust be feeling her death terribl y. When I said \nnothing he added hastily and with a rather embarrassed air that some of the people in \nthe street said nasty things about me becau se I’d sent m y mother to the Ho me. But \nhe, of course, knew better; he knew how devoted to my mother I had always been. \nI answered—why, I still don’t know—that it surprised me to l earn I’d produced \nsuch a bad im pression. As I couldn’t afford  to keep her here, it seemed the obvi ous \nthing to do, to send her to a home. “In any case,” I added, “for years she’d never had  \na word to say to me, and I could see she was moping, with no one to talk to.” \n“Yes,” he said, “and at a home one makes friends, anyhow.” \nHe got up, saying it was high time for him to  be in bed, and added that life was \ngoing to be a bit of a problem for him , under the new conditions. For the first time \nsince I’d known hi m he held out his ha nd to m e—rather shyl y, I thought—and I \ncould feel the scales on his ski n. Just as he was going out of the door, he turned and, \nsmiling a little, said: \n“Let’s hope the dogs won’t bark again tonight. I always think it’s mine I hear. ...” \n 31\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nVI \nIT was an effort waking up t hat Sunday morning; Marie had to jog my shoulders and \nshout my name. As we wanted to get i nto the water early, we didn’t  trouble about \nbreakfast. My head was aching slightly and my first cigarette had a bitter taste. Marie \ntold me I l ooked like a m ourner at a funera l, and I certainly did feel very lim p. She \nwas wearing a white dress and had he r ha ir loose. I told her she looked qui te \nravishing like that, and she laughed happily. \nOn our way out we banged on Raymond’s door, and he shout ed that he’d be with \nus in a jiffy. We went down to the street and, because of my being rather under the \nweather and our having kept the blind down in my room, the gl are of the mor ning \nsun hit me in the eyes like a clenched fist. \nMarie, however, was alm ost dancing with  delight, and kept repeating, “What a \nheavenly day!” After a few minutes I was feeling better, and notic ed that I was \nhungry. I mentioned this to M arie, but sh e paid no attention. She was carrying an \noilcloth bag in which she had stowed our ba thing kit and a towel. Presently we heard \nRaymond shutti ng his door. He was wearing blue trousers, a short-sle eved white \nshirt, and a straw hat. I noticed that his fo rearms were rather hairy, but the skin was \nvery white beneath. The straw hat made Marie giggle. Personally, I was rather put off \nby his getup. He seemed in high spirits and was whistling as he came down the stairs. \nHe greeted me with, “Hello, old boy!” and addressed Marie as “Mademoiselle.” \nOn the previous evening we had visited th e police station, wher e I gav e evidence \nfor Raymond—about the girl’s having been fals e to him. So they let him off with a \nwarning. They didn’t check my statement. \nAfter some talk on the doorste p we decided to take the bus. Th e beach was within \neasy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the better. Just as we were starting \nfor the bus stop, Raym ond plucked my sleeve and told me to look across the street. I \nsaw some Arabs lounging against the tobacc onist’s window. They were staring at us \nsilently, in the special way these people have —as if we were blocks  of stone or dead \ntrees. Raymond whispered that the second Arab from  the le ft was “his m an,” and I \nthought he looked ra ther worried However, he assured me that all that was ancient \nhistory. Marie, who hadn’t followed his remarks, asked, “What is it?” \nI explained that those Arabs across th e way had a grudge against Raym ond. She \ninsisted on our going at once. Then Raymond laughed, and squared his shoulde rs. \nThe young lady was quite right , he said. There was no poi nt in hanging about here. \nHalfway to the bus stop he glanced b ack over his shoul der and said the Arabs \nweren’t following. I,  too, looked back. They  wer e exactly as before, gazing in the \nsame vague way at the spot where we had been. \n 32\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nWhen we were in the bus, Raym ond, who now seemed quite at ease, kept making \njokes to amuse Marie. I could see he was a ttracted by her, but she had hardly a word \nfor him. Now and again she would catch my eye and smile. \nWe alighted just outside Algiers. The b each is not far from the bus stop; one has \nonly to cross a patch of highl and, a sort of plateau, which ove rlooks the sea and \nshelves down steeply to the sands. The ground here was cove red with yellowi sh \npebbles and wild lil ies that showed snow-w hite against the blue of t he sky, which \nhad already the hard, m etallic glint it gets  on very hot days. Marie amused herself \nswishing her bag a gainst t he flowers a nd sendi ng t he petals show ering i n all \ndirections. Then we walked between two rows of little houses with wooden balconies \nand green or white palings. Some of them we re half hidden i n clumps of tamarisks; \nothers rose naked from  the stony plateau. Befo re we came to the end of it, the sea \nwas in full view; it lay sm ooth as a m irror, and in the distance a big headland jutt ed \nout over its black reflection. Through the still air came the faint buzz of a m otor \nengine and we saw a fishi ng boat very far out, gl iding almost imperceptibly across \nthe dazzling smoothness. \nMarie picked some rock iris es. Going down the steep path leading to the sea, we  \nsaw some bathers already on the sands. \nRaymond’s friend owned a sm all wooden bungalow at the near end of the beach. \nIts back rested against the cliffside, while  the front stood on piles, which the water \nwas already lapping. Raymond introduced us to his friend, whose name was Masson. \nHe was tall, broad-s houldered, and thick- set; his wife was a plum p, cheerful little \nwoman who spoke with a Paris accent. \nMasson promptly told us to make ourselves  at home. He had gone out fishing, he \nsaid, first thing in the m orning, and th ere would be fried fish for lunch.  I \ncongratulated him on his little bungalow, and he  said he always spent his week ends \nand holidays here. “With the missus, needless to say,” he added. I glanced at her, and \nnoticed that she and Marie seemed to  be getting on well together; laughing and \nchattering away. For the first time, perhaps, I seriously co nsidered the possibility of \nmy marrying her. \nMasson wanted to have a swim  at once, but his wife and Raym ond were \ndisinclined to move. So only the three of  us, Marie, Masson, and m yself, went down \nto the beach. Marie prom ptly plunged in, but Masson and I waited for a bit. He was \nrather slow of speech and ha d, I notic ed, a habit of saying “and what’s m ore” \nbetween his phrases—even when the second added nothing really to the first. Talking \nof Marie, he said: “She’s an awfully pretty girl, and what’s more, charming.” \nBut I soon ceas ed paying attention to this  trick of his; I was baski ng in the \nsunlight, which, I noticed, was m aking me feel much better. The sand was beginning \nto stoke up underfoot and, though I was eager for a dip, I postponed it for a minute or \ntwo m ore. At last I said to Masson: “Shall we go in now ?” and plunged. Masson \n 33\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwalked in gingerly and only began to swi m when he was out of hi s depth. He swam \nhand over hand and made slow headway, so  I left him  behind and caught  up wit h \nMarie. The water was cold and I felt all  the better for it. We swam  a long way out, \nMarie and I, side by side, and it was pleasant feeling how our m ovements matched, \nhers and mine, and how we were both in the same mood, enjoying every moment. \nOnce we were out in the open, we lay o n our backs and, as I gazed up at the sky, I \ncould feel the sun drawing up t he film of salt water on m y lips and cheeks. We saw \nMasson swim back to the beach and slum p down on the sand under the sun. In the \ndistance he looked enorm ous, like a strande d whale. Then Marie proposed that we \nshould swim tandem. She we nt ahead and I put m y ar ms round her waist, from \nbehind, and while she drew me  forward with her arm  strokes, I kicked out behi nd to \nhelp us on. \nThat sound of little splashes had been in my ears for so long that I began to feel I’d \nhad enough of it. So I let go of Marie and swam back at an easy pace, taking long,  \ndeep breaths. When I made the beach I stretched m yself be lly dow nward beside \nMasson, resting m y face on the sand. I told  him “it was fine” here, and he agreed. \nPresently Marie came back. I raised m y head to watch her approach. She was \nglistening with brine and holdi ng her hair  back. Then she lay down beside m e, and \nwhat with the combined warmth of our bodies and the sun, I felt myself dropping off \nto sleep. \nAfter a while Marie tugged my ar m. an d said Masson had gone to his place;  i t \nmust be nearly lunchtime. I rose at once, as I was feeling hungry, but Marie told me I \nhadn’t kissed her once since the early m orning. That was so—though I’d wanted to, \nseveral times. “Let’s go into the wat er again,” she said, and we ran into the sea and  \nlay flat am ongst the ripples for a m oment. Then we swam a few strokes, and when \nwe were almost out of our depth she flung her arms round me and hugged me. I felt \nher legs twining round mine, and my senses tingled. \nWhen we got back, Masson was on the st eps of hi s bungalow, shouting to us to \ncome. I told him  I was raven ously hungry, and he prom ptly turned t o his wife and \nsaid he’d taken quite a fancy to me. The bread was excellent, and I had my full share \nof the fish. Then came som e steak and potat o chips. None of us  spoke while eating. \nMasson drank a lot of wine and kept refill ing my glass the moment it was empty. By \nthe time coffee was handed round I was feeling slightly muzzy, and I started smoking \none cigarette after another. Masson, Raymond, and I discussed a plan of spending the \nwhole of August on the beach together, sharing expenses. \nSuddenly Marie exclaim ed: “I say! Do  you know  the tim e? It’s onl y half-past  \neleven!” \nWe were all surprised at that, and Mass on remark ed that we’d had a very early \nlunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt like it. \nThis set Marie laughing, I don’t know why. I suspect she’d drunk a bit too much. \n 34\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nThen Masson asked if I’d like to come with him for a stroll on the beach. \n“My wife always has a nap after lunch,” he said. “Personally I find it doesn’t agree \nwith me; what I need is a short walk. I’ m always telling her it’s much better for the \nhealth. But, of course, she’s entitled to her own opinion.” \nMarie proposed to stay and help with the washing up. Mme Masson sm iled and \nsaid that, in that case, the first thing was to get the men out of the way. So we went \nout together, the three of us. \nThe light was alm ost vertical and the gl are from the water s eared one’s eyes. Th e \nbeach was quite deserted now. One could h ear a faint tinkle of knives and forks and \ncrockery in the shacks and bungalows lining the foreshore. Heat was welling up from \nthe rocks, and one could hardly breathe. \nAt first Raym ond and Masson talked of  things and peopl e I didn’t  know. I \ngathered that they’d been acquainted for some time and ha d even lived together for a \nwhile. We went down to the water’s edge and walked along it; now and then a longer \nwave wet our canvas shoes. I wasn’t thinking of anything, as all that sunlight beating \ndown on my bare head made me feel half asleep. \nJust then Raymond said som ething to M asson that I didn’t  quite catch. But at the \nsame moment I noticed two Arabs in bl ue dungarees a long way down the beach, \ncoming in our direction. I gave Raym ond a look and he nodded, saying, “That’s \nhim.” We walked st eadily on.  Masson wonde red how they’d m anaged to track us \nhere. My im pression was that  they had seen us taking the bus and noticed Marie’s \noilcloth bathing bag; but I didn’t say anything. \nThough the Arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already. We didn’t \nchange our pace, but Raymond said: \n“Listen! If there’s a roughhouse, you, Ma sson, take on the second one. I’ll tackle \nthe fellow who’s after me. A nd you, Meursault, stand by to help i f another one \ncomes up, and lay him out.” \nI said, “Right,” and Masson put his hands in his pockets. \nThe sand was as hot as fire, and I coul d have sworn it was glowing red. The \ndistance between us and the Arabs was st eadily decreasing. When we were only a \nfew steps away the Arabs halted. Masson and I slowed  down, while Raym ond went \nstraight up to his man. I couldn’t hear what he said, but I saw the native lowering hi s \nhead, as if to but t hi m in the chest. Ray mond lashed out  prom ptly and shouted t o \nMasson to come. Masson went up to the ma n he had been marking and struck hi m \ntwice with all his m ight. The fellow fell flat  into the water and stayed there so me \nseconds with bubbles coming up to the surface round his head. Meanwhile Raymond \nhad been slogging the other man, whose face  was streaming with blood. He glanced \nat me over his shoulder and shouted: \n“Just you watch! I ain’t finished with him yet!” \n“Look out!” I cried. “He’s got a knife.” \n 35\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI spoke too late. The man had gashed Raymond’s arm and his mouth as well. \nMasson sprang forward. The other Arab got  up from the water and placed him self \nbehind the fellow with the kni fe. We didn’t dare to m ove. The two natives backed \naway slowly, keeping us at bay with the knife and never taking their eyes off us.  \nWhen they were at a safe distance they  swung round and took t o thei r heels. We \nstood stoc k-still, with the sunl ight b eating down on us. Bl ood was dripping from \nRaymond’s wounded arm, which he was squeezing hard above the elbow. \nMasson remarked that there was a doctor who always spent his Sundays here, and \nRaymond said: “Good. Let’s go to him  at once.” He could hardly get the words out, \nas the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his mouth. \nWe each gave hi m an ar m and helped him back to the bungalow. On ce we were \nthere he told us the wounds weren’t so ve ry deep and he could walk to where the \ndoctor was. Marie had gone quite pale, and Mme Masson was in tears. \nMasson and Raym ond went off to the docto r’s while I was le ft behind at the \nbungalow to explain m atters to the women. I didn’t m uch relish the task and soon \ndried up and started smoking, staring at the sea. \nRaymond came back at about half-past on e, accompanied by Masson. He had his \narm bandaged and a strip of sti cking plaster on the corner of his m outh. The doctor \nhad assured him it was nothing serious, but he was looking very glum. Masson tried \nto make him laugh, but without success. \nPresently Raymond said he was going for a stroll on th e beach. I asked him where \nhe proposed to go, and he mumbled something about “wanting to take the air.” We—\nMasson and I—then said we’d go with him , but he flew into a rage and told us to \nmind our own business. Masson said we m ustn’t insist, seeing the state he was in. \nHowever, when he went out, I followed him. \nIt was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight  splintering into flakes of fire on the \nsand and sea. We walked for quite a wh ile, and I had an idea that Raym ond had a \ndefinite idea where he was going; but probably I was mistaken about this. \nAt the end of the beach we came to a s mall stream that had cut a ch annel in the \nsand, after com ing out from  behind a biggis h rock. There we found our two Arabs \nagain, lying on the sand in t heir blue dungarees. They looked ha rmless enough, as if \nthey didn’t bear any malice, and neit her made any m ove when we approached. The \nman who had slashed Raym ond stared at hi m without speaki ng. The other man was \nblowing down a little reed and  extracting fro m it three notes of the scale, which h e \nplayed over and over again, while he watched us from the corner of an eye. \nFor a while nobody m oved; it was all sunlight  and silence except for the tinkle of \nthe stream and those three little lonely sounds. Then Raym ond put his hand to his \nrevolver pocket, but the Arabs still didn’t move. I noticed the m an playing on the \nreed had his big toes splayed out almost at right angles to his feet. \nStill keeping his eyes on his man, Raymond said to me: “Shall I plug him one?” \n 36\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI thought quickly. If I tol d him not to, c onsidering the m ood he was in, he m ight \nvery well fly into a temper and use his gun. So I said the first thing that came into my \nhead. \n“He hasn’t spoken to you yet.  It would be a lowdown trick t o shoot him like that, \nin cold blood.” \nAgain, for some m oments one heard nothi ng but t he tinkle of the stream  and the \nflute notes weaving through the hot, still air. \n“Well,” Raym ond said at last, “if that’s  how you feel, I’d better say something \ninsulting, and if he answers back I’ll loose off.” \n“Right,” I said. “Only, if he doesn’t get out his knife you’ve no business to fire.” \nRaymond was beginning t o fidget. The Arab with the reed went on playing, and \nboth of them watched all our movements. \n“Listen,” I said t o Raymond. “You take on t he fellow on the right, and give me \nyour revolver. If the other one starts making trouble or gets out his knife, I’ll shoot.” \nThe sun glinted on Raymond’s revolver as he handed it to me. But nobody made a \nmove yet; it was just as if everything had clos ed in on us so that we couldn’t sti r. We \ncould only watch each othe r, never lowering our eyes; the whole world seemed  to  \nhave come to a standstill on this little strip of sand between the sunlight and the sea,  \nthe twofold silence of the reed and stream. And just then it crossed my mind that one \nmight fire, or not fire—and it would come to absolutely the same thing. \nThen, all of a sudde n, the Arabs vanishe d; they’d slipped like lizards under cover \nof the rock. So Raym ond and I turned a nd walked back. He seemed happier, and \nbegan talking about the bus to catch for our return. \nWhen we reach ed the bungalow Ray mond promptly went up the wooden steps, \nbut I halted on the bottom one. The light seemed thudding in my head and I coul dn’t \nface the effort needed to go up the steps and make myself amiable to the women. But \nthe heat was so great that it was just as bad staying where I was,  under that flood of \nblinding light falling from the sky. To stay, or to make a move—it came to much the \nsame. After a moment I returned to the beach, and started walking. \nThere was  the same red glare as far as eye could reach, an d small waves were \nlapping the hot sand in little, flurried gasps. As I slowly walked toward the boulde rs \nat the end of the beach I could feel my temples swelling under the impact of the light. \nIt pressed itself on me, trying t o check my progress. And each tim e I felt a hot  blast \nstrike my forehead, I gritted m y teeth, I cl enched my fists in m y trouser pockets and \nkeyed up every nerve to fend off the sun and t he dark befuddlem ent it was pouri ng \ninto me. Whenever  a blade of  vivid light shot upward from a bit of shell or broken \nglass lying on the sand, m y jaws set hard. I wasn’t going t o be beaten, and I walked \nsteadily on. \nThe small black hump of rock  came into view far down the beach. It was rimmed  \nby a dazzling sheen of light and feathery sp ray, but I was thinking of the cold, cl ear \n 37\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nstream behind it, and longing to hear again the tinkle of running water. Anything to \nbe rid of the glare, the sight of women in tears, the strain and effort—and to retrieve \nthe pool of shadow by the rock and its cool silence! \nBut when I cam e nearer I saw that Ra ymond’s Arab had returned. He was by \nhimself this time, lying on his back, his hands behind his head, his face shaded by the \nrock while the sun beat on the rest of his body. One could see his dungarees steaming \nin the heat . I was rat her taken aback; my  impression had been that the incident was \nclosed, and I hadn’t given a thought to it on my way here. \nOn seeing m e, the Arab raised him self a little, and his hand we nt to his pocket. \nNaturally, I gripped Raymond’s revolver in the pocket of my coat. Then the Arab let \nhimself sink back a gain, but  without  taki ng his hand from  his pocket. I was some \ndistance off, at least ten yards, and m ost of the time I saw him as a blurred dark form \nwobbling in the heat haze. So metimes, however, I had glim pses of his e yes glowing \nbetween the half-closed lids. The sound of the waves was even lazier, feebler, than at \nnoon. But the light hadn’t changed; it was pou nding as fiercely as ever on the long \nstretch of sand that ended at the rock. For two hours the sun seemed to have made no \nprogress; becal med in a sea of molten steel . Far out on the horizon a steamer was  \npassing; I could just make out from  the co rner of an eye the s mall black movin g \npatch, while I kept my gaze fixed on the Arab. \nIt struck me that all I had to do was to turn, walk away, and think no more about it. \nBut the whole beach , pulsing with heat, wa s pressing on my back. I took some steps  \ntoward the stream. The Arab didn’t m ove. After all, there was still some distance \nbetween us. Perhaps because of the shadow on his face, he seemed to be grinning at \nme. \nI waited. The heat was beginning to sc orch my cheeks; b eads of sweat were  \ngathering in m y eyebrows. It was just the same s ort o f h eat as at my mother’s \nfuneral, and I had the same disagreeab le sensations—especially in my forehead, \nwhere all the veins seemed to be bursti ng through the ski n. I couldn’t stand it  any \nlonger, and took another step forward. I knew it was a fool thing to do; I wouldn’t get \nout of the sun by moving on a yard or so.  But I took that step, just one step, forward . \nAnd then the Arab drew his knife and held it up toward me, athwart the sunlight. \nA shaft of light shot  upward from  the steel , and I felt as if a long, thin blade \ntransfixed my forehead. At the same moment all the swea t that had accu mulated in \nmy eyebrows splashed down on m y eyelids, covering t hem with a warm  film of \nmoisture. Beneath a veil of brine and te ars my eyes were blinded; I was conscious \nonly of the cym bals of the sun clashing on m y skull, and, less distinctl y, of the keen \nblade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes, and gouging into my \neyeballs. \nThen everything be gan to reel before m y ey es, a fiery gust came from the sea, \nwhile the sky cracked in two, from  end to  end, and a great sheet of fl ame poured \n 38\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \ndown through the rift. Every nerve in my body was a steel spring, and my grip closed \non the revolver. The trigger ga ve, and the smooth underbelly of the but t jogged my \npalm. And so, with that crisp, whipcrack sound, it all began. I shook off m y sweat \nand the clinging vei l of light. I knew I’d  shattered the balance of the day, the  \nspacious calm of this beach on which I had been happy. But I fired four shots m ore \ninto the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was \nanother loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing. \n 39"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nPart Two \nI \nI was questioned several tim es immediately after my arrest. But they were all formal \nexaminations, as to my identity and so forth. At the first of these, which took place at \nthe police station, nobody seemed to have m uch interest in the case. However, when \nI was brought before the exam ining magistrate a week later, I no ticed that he eyed \nme with distinct curiosity. Like the othe rs, he began by asking m y name, address, \nand occupation, the date and place of my bi rth. Then he inquired if I had chosen a \nlawyer to defend me. I answered, “No,” I hadn’t thought about it, and asked him  if it \nwas really necessary for me to have one. \n“Why do you ask that?” he said . I replied that I re garded my case as very sim ple. \nHe smiled. “Well, it ma y seem so to you. But we’ve got  to abide by the law, and, i f \nyou don’t engage a lawyer, the court will have to appoint one for you.” \nIt struck me as an excellent arrangement  that the authorities should see to details \nof this kind, and I told him  so. He nodded,  and agreed that the Code was all that \ncould be desired. \nAt first I didn’t take him  quite seriousl y. The room  in which he interviewed me \nwas much like an ordinary sitting room, with curtained windows, and a single lamp \nstanding on the desk. Its light fell on the armchair in which he’d had me sit, while his \nown face stayed in shadow. \nI had read descriptions of such scenes in books, and at first it all seemed like a \ngame. After our conversation, however, I ha d a good look at him. He was a tall man \nwith clean-cut features, deep-set blue eyes, a big gray m ustache, and abundant , \nalmost snow-white hair, and he gave me the im pression of being highly intelligent \nand, on the whole, likable enough. There wa s only one thing that put  one off: his \nmouth had now and then a rather ugly twist; but  it seemed to be only a sort  of \nnervous tic. When leaving, I ve ry nearly held out my hand and said, “Good-by”; just \nin time I remembered that I’d killed a man. \nNext day a lawyer came to m y cell; a small, plum p, youngish m an with sleek \nblack hair. In spite of the heat—I was in  my shirt sleeves— he was wearing a dark \nsuit, stiff collar, and  a rather showy tie, with broad black and white stripes. After \ndepositing his brief case on my bed, he in troduced him self, and added that he’d \nperused the record of my cas e with the utmost care. His opinion was that it would \nneed cautious handli ng, but there was ever y prospect of m y getting off, provided I \nfollowed his advice. I thanked him, and he said: “Good. Now let’s get down to it.” \n 40\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nSitting on the bed, h e said that they’d been  making investigations into m y private \nlife. They had learned that m y mother died recently in a home. Inquiries had been \nconducted at Marengo and the  police informed that I’d shown “gr eat callousness” at \nmy mother’s funeral. \n“You m ust understa nd,” the lawyer said, “that I don’t  relish having t o question \nyou about such a matter. But it has much importance, and, unless I find some way of \nanswering the charge of ‘callousness,’ I shall be handicappe d in conducting your \ndefense. And that is where you, and only you, can help me.” \nHe went on to ask if I had felt grief on that “sad occasion.” The question struck me \nas an odd one; I’d have been much embarrassed if I’d had to ask anyone a thing li ke \nthat. \nI answered that, of recent years, I’d rather lost the habit of noting my feelings, and \nhardly knew what to answer. I could trut hfully say I’d been quite fond of Mother—\nbut really that didn’t mean much. All normal people, I added as  on afterthought, had \nmore or less desired the death of those they loved, at some time or another. \nHere the lawyer interrupted me, looking greatly perturbed. \n“You m ust prom ise me not t o say anything of that sort at th e trial,  or to the \nexamining magistrate.” \nI promised, to satisfy him, but I explained that my physical condition at any given \nmoment often influe nced my feelings. Fo r instance, on the day I attended Mother’s \nfuneral, I was fagged out and only half awake. So, really, I hardly took stock of what \nwas happening. Anyhow, I could assure him of one thing: that I’d rather Mother \nhadn’t died. \nThe lawyer, however, looked displeased. “That’s not enough,” he said curtly. \nAfter considering for a bit  he asked m e if he could say that on that day I had kept \nmy feelings under control. \n“No,” I said. “That wouldn’t be true.” \nHe gave me a queer look, as if I slight ly revolted him ; then informed me, in an \nalmost hostile tone, that in any case the head of the Ho me and som e of the sta ff \nwould be cited as witnesses. \n“And that might do you a very nasty turn,” he concluded. \nWhen I suggested that Mother’s death ha d no connection with the charge against \nme, he merely replied that this remark showed I’d neve r had any dealings with t he \nlaw. \nSoon after this he left, looking quite vexe d. I wished he had stayed longer and I \ncould have explained that I de sired his sympathy, not for him to make a better job of \nmy defense, but, if I m ight put it so, s pontaneously. I could see that I got on hi s \nnerves; he couldn’t make me out, and, naturally enough, th is irritated him . Once or \ntwice I had a mind to assure him that I was just like everybody else; quite an ordinary \n 41\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nperson. But really t hat would have serv ed no great purpose, and I let it go—out  of \nlaziness as much as anything else. \nLater in the day I was taken again to t he examining magistrate’s office. It was two \nin the afternoon and, this tim e, the room  was flooded with light—there was only a \nthin curtain on the window—and extremely hot. \nAfter inviting m e to sit down,  the m agistrate informed m e in a very polite tone \nthat, “owing to unforeseen cir cumstances,” my lawyer was unable to be present. I \nshould be quite entitled, he added, to reserve m y answers to his questions until my \nlawyer could attend. \nTo this I replied that I could answer fo r myself. He pressed a bell push on his desk \nand a young clerk came in and seated hims elf just behind me. Then we—I and t he \nmagistrate—settled back in our chairs a nd the exam ination began. He led off by \nremarking that I had the reputation of bei ng a taci turn, rather self-centered person, \nand he’d like to know what I had to say to that. I answered: \n“Well, I rarely have anything much to say. So, naturally I keep my mouth shut.” \nHe s miled as on the previous occasion, and agreed that that was the best of \nreasons. “In any case,” he added, “it has little or no importance.” \nAfter a short silence he suddenly leaned fo rward, looked me in the eyes, and said, \nraising his voice a little: \n“What really interests me is—you!” \nI wasn’t quite clear what he meant, so I made no comment. \n“There are several things,” he continued, “that puzzle me  about your cri me. I feel \nsure that you will help me to understand them.” \nWhen I replied that really it was quite si mple, he asked me to give him  an account \nof what I’d done that day. As a matter of  fact, I had already told hi m at our first \ninterview—in a summary sort of way, of course —about Raym ond, the beach, our \nswim, the fight, then the beach again, and th e five shots I’d fired. But I went over i t \nall again, and after each phrase he nodded. “Quite so, quite so.” When I described the \nbody lying on the sand, he nodded m ore emphatically, and said, “Good!” I was tired \nof repeating the same story; I felt as if I’d never talked so much in all my life before. \nAfter another silence he stoo d up and sai d he’d l ike to help me; I interested him , \nand, with God’s hel p, he would do something for m e in my trouble. But, first, h e \nmust put a few more questions. \nHe began by asking bluntly if I’d loved my mother. \n“Yes,” I replied, “like everybody else.” The clerk behind me, who had been typing \naway at a steady pace, must just then have hit the wrong keys, as I heard him pushing \nthe carrier back and crossing something out. \nNext, without any apparent logical conn ection, the m agistrate sprang anothe r \nquestion. \n“Why did you fire five consecutive shots?” \n 42\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI thought for a bit; then explained that th ey weren’t quite consecutive. I fired one \nat first, and the other four after a short interval. \n“Why did you pause between the first and second shot?” \nI seemed to see it hovering again before my eyes, the red glow of the beach, and to \nfeel that fiery breath on my cheeks—and, this time, I made no answer. \nDuring the silence that followed, the magi strate kept fidgeting, running his fingers \nthrough his hair, half rising, then sitting down again. Finally, planting his elbows on  \nthe desk, he bent toward me with a queer expression. \n“But why, why did you go on firing at a prostrate man?” \nAgain I found nothing to reply. \nThe magistrate drew his hand across his forehead and repeated in a slightly  \ndifferent tone: \n“I ask you ‘Why?’ I insist on your telling me.” I still kept silent. \nSuddenly he rose, walked to a file cab inet standing agai nst the opposite wall, \npulled a drawer open, and took from  it a silv er crucifix, which he was waving as he \ncame back to the desk. \n“Do you know who this i s?” His voice ha d changed com pletely; it was vibrant \nwith emotion. \n“Of course I do,” I answered. \nThat seemed to start  him off; he began speaking at a great pace. He told me he \nbelieved in God, and that even the worst of  sinners could obtain forgi veness of Him. \nBut first he m ust repent, and beco me like a little child, with a sim ple, trustful heart, \nopen to conviction. He was leaning right acr oss the table, brandishing his crucifix \nbefore my eyes. \nAs a matter of fact, I had gre at difficult y in following his remarks, as, for one \nthing, the office was so stiflingly hot and big flies were buzzing round and settling on \nmy cheeks; also because he rat her alarmed me. Of course, I realized it was absurd to \nfeel like this, considering that, after all, it was I wh o was th e criminal. However, as  \nhe continued talking, I did m y best to un derstand, and I gathe red that there was only \none point in m y confession that badly n eeded clearing up—the fact  that I’d waited  \nbefore firi ng a second time. All the rest was,  so to speak, quite in order; but  that \ncompletely baffled him. \nI started to tell him  that he was wrong in  insisting on this; th e point was of quite \nminor importance. But, before I could get the words out, he ha d drawn himself up to \nhis full height and was asking me very earn estly if I believed  in God. When I said, \n“No,” he plumped down into his chair indignantly. \nThat was unthinkable, he said; all men believe in God, even those who reject Him. \nOf this he was absolutely sure ; if ever he came to doubt it, his life would l ose all \nmeaning. “Do you wish,” he asked indi gnantly, “m y life to have no meaning?” \nReally I couldn’t see how my wishes came into it, and I told him as much. \n 43\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nWhile I was talking,  he thrust the crucif ix again just under my nose and shouted:  \n“I, anyhow, am a Christian. And I pray Him  to forgive you for your si ns. My poor \nyoung man, how can you not believe that He suffered for your sake?” \nI not iced that his m anner seemed genuinely  sol icitous when he said, “My poor \nyoung m an”—but I was beginning to have  enough of it. The room was growing \nsteadily hotter. \nAs I usually do when I want to get rid of someone whose conversation bores me, I \npretended to agree. At which, rather to my surprise, his face lit up. \n“You see! You see! Now won’t you own th at you believe and put your trust i n \nHim?” \nI must have shaken my head again, for he sank back in his chair, looking lim p and \ndejected. \nFor some mo ments there was a silence during which the type writer, which had \nbeen clicking away all the time we talked , caught up with the last remark. Then he \nlooked at me intently and rather sadly. \n“Never in all m y experience have I known a soul so case-hardened as yours,” he \nsaid in a low tone. “All the criminals who have come before me until now wept when \nthey saw this symbol of our Lord’s sufferings.” \nI was on the point of replying that was precisely because they were criminals. But \nthen I realized that I, too, came under th at description. Som ehow it was an idea to \nwhich I never could get reconciled. \nTo indicate, presumably, that the interv iew was over, the magistrate stood up. In \nthe same weary tone he asked me a last question: Did I regret what I had done? \nAfter thinking a bit, I said that what I felt was less regret than a kind of vexation—\nI couldn’t find a better word for it. But he di dn’t seem to understa nd. ... This was as \nfar as things went at that day’s interview. \nI came before the magistrate many tim es more, but on these occasions m y lawyer \nalways accompanied me. The exam inations were confined t o asking me to amplify \nmy previous statements. Or else the magistrate and m y lawyer discussed \ntechnicalities. At such tim es they took ve ry little notice of m e, and, in any case, the \ntone of t he examinations changed as time went on. The magistra te seemed to hav e \nlost interest in me, and to  have come to some sort-o f decision about m y case. He \nnever mentioned God again or displayed a ny of the religious fervor I had found so \nembarrassing at our first inte rview. Th e result was that our  relations be came m ore \ncordial. After a few q uestions, followed by an exchange of remarks with the lawyer , \nthe m agistrate closed the in terview. My case was “taking it s course,” as he put it. \nSometimes, too, the  conversation was of a general order, and the m agistrate and \nlawyer encouraged me to join in it. I began to breathe more freely. Neither of the two \nmen, at th ese times, showed the least hostility toward m e, and everything went so \nsmoothly, so amiably, that I had an absurd impression of being “one of the family.” I \n 44\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \ncan honestly say that during t he eleven m onths these exam inations lasted I got so \nused to them that I was alm ost surprised at having ever enjoyed anything better than \nthose rare moments when the magistrate, after escorting me to the door of the office, \nwould pat my shoulder and say in a friendly tone: “Well, Mr. Antichrist, that’s all for \nthe present!” After which I was made over to my jailers. \n 45"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nII \nTHERE are some things of wh ich I’ve never cared to talk. And, a few days after I’d \nbeen sent to prison, I decided that this phase of my life was one of them. However, as \ntime went by, I came to feel that this aversi on had no real substance. In point of fact, \nduring those early days, I was hardly consci ous of being i n prison; I had always a \nvague hope that something would turn up, some agreeable surprise. \nThe change came soon after Marie’s first a nd only visit. From  the day when I got  \nher letter telling me they wouldn’t let her come t o see me any more, because s he \nwasn’t my wife—it was from that day that I realized that this cell was my last home, \na dead end, so to speak. \nOn the day of m y arrest they put me in a biggish room  with several other \nprisoners, mostly Arabs. They grinned w hen they saw me enter, and as ked me what  \nI’d done. I told them I’d killed an Ar ab, and they kept m um for a while. But \npresently night began to fall,  and one of them  explained to me how to lay out my \nsleeping mat. By rolling up one end one makes a sort of bol ster. All night I felt bugs \ncrawling over my face. \nSome days later I was put by m yself in a cell, where I slept on a plank bed hinged \nto the wall. The only other furniture was a la trine bucket and a tin basin. The prison \nstands on rising ground, and through my little window I had glimpses of the sea. One \nday when I was hanging on the bars, straini ng my eyes toward the sunl ight playing \non the waves, a jailer entered a nd said I had a visitor. I th ought it must be Marie, and \nso it was. \nTo go to the Visitors’ Room, I was taken along a corridor, then up a flight of steps, \nthen along another corridor. It was a ve ry large room, lit by a big bow window, and \ndivided into three com partments by high iron grilles running transversally. Between \nthe two grilles there was a gap  of som e thirty feet, a sort of no man’s land between  \nthe prisoners and their friends.  I was led to a point exactly opposite Marie, who was \nwearing her striped dress. On my side of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners, \nArabs for the m ost part. On Marie’s side  were m ostly Moor ish women. She was \nwedged between a small old wo man with tight-set lips and a fat matron, without a \nhat, who was talking shrill y and gesticulated all t he ti me. Because of the distance \nbetween the visitors and prisoners I found I, too, had to raise my voice. \nWhen I came into the room  the babel of voices echoing on the bare walls, and the \nsunlight streaming in, flooding everything in  a harsh white glare, made me feel quite \ndizzy. After the relative darkness and th e silence of m y cell it took m e so me \nmoments to get used to these conditions. After a bit, however, I came to see each \nface quite clearly, lit up as if a spotlight played on it. \n 46\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nI noticed a prison official seat ed at e ach end of t he no man’s land bet ween the \ngrilles. The native p risoners and their re lations on the other side were squatting \nopposite each other. They didn’t raise their voices and, in spite of the din, m anaged \nto converse alm ost in whispers. This m urmur of voi ces coming from below m ade a \nsort of accompaniment to the conversations going on above their heads. I took stoc k \nof all this very quickly and m oved a step  forward toward Marie. She was pressing \nher brown, sun-tanned face to the bars and smiling as hard as she could. I thought she \nwas looking very pretty, but somehow couldn’t bring myself to tell her so. \n“Well?” she asked, pitching her voice very high. “What about it? Are you all right, \nhave you everything you want?” \n“Oh, yes. I’ve everything I want.” \nWe were silent for some moments; Ma rie went on sm iling. The fat wom an was \nbawling at the prisoner beside me, her husband presumably, a tall, fair, pleasant-\nlooking man. \n“Jeanne refused to have him,” she yelled. \n“That’s just too bad,” the man replied. \n“Yes, and I told her you’ d take him  back the moment you got out ; but she \nwouldn’t hear of it.” \nMarie shouted across the gap that Raymond sent me his best wishes, and I said, \n“Thanks.” But my voice was drowned by my neighbor’s, asking “if he was quite fit.” \nThe fat woman gave a laugh. “Fit? I should say he is! The picture of health.” \nMeanwhile the prisoner on my left, a youngster with thin, girlish hands, never said \na word. His eyes, I noticed, were fixed on  the little old woman opposite him, and she \nreturned his gaze wit h a sort of hungry passi on. But I had to stop looking at them as \nMarie was shouting to me that we mustn’t lose hope. \n“Certainly not,” I answered. My gaze fe ll on her shoulders, and I had a sudden \nlonging to squeeze them, through the thin dress. Its silky texture fascinated me, and I \nhad a feeling that the hope she spoke of centered on it, somehow. I im agine \nsomething of the same sort was in Marie’ s mind, for she went on sm iling, looking \nstraight at me. \n“It’ll all come right, you’ll see, and then we shall get married.” \nAll I could see of her now was the white flash of her teeth, and the little puckers \nround her eyes. I answered: “Do you really think so?” but chiefly becau se I felt it up \nto me to answer something. \nShe started talking very fast in the same high-pitched voice. \n“Yes, you’ll be acquitted, and we’ll go bathing again, Sundays.” \nThe woman beside me was still yelling a way, telling her husband that she’d left a \nbasket for him  in the prison office. She ga ve a list of the thi ngs she’d brought a nd \ntold him  to m ind and check them  carefully , as some had  cost quite a lot. Th e \nyoungster on m y other side and his m other were still gazing m ournfully at each \n 47\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nother, and the murmur of the Arabs droned on below us. The light out side seemed to \nbe surging up against the window, seeping through, and smearing the faces of the \npeople facing it with a coat of yellow oil. \nI began to feel slightly squeam ish, and wished I could leave. The strident voice \nbeside me was jarring on my ears. But, on the other hand, I wanted to have the most I \ncould of Marie’s com pany. I’ve no idea how m uch time passed. I remember Marie’s \ndescribing to me her work, with that se t smile always on her face. There wasn’t a \nmoment’s letup in the noise—shouts, c onversations, and always that m uttering \nundertone. The only oasis of silence wa s made by the young fellow  and the old \nwoman gazing into each other’s eyes. \nThen, one by one, the Arabs were led away ; almost everyone fell silent when the \nfirst one left. The little old woman pressed he rself against the bars and at the same \nmoment a jailer tapped her s on’s shoul der. He called, “ Au revoir , Mother,” and , \nslipping her hand between the bars, she gave him a small, slow wave with it. \nNo sooner was she gone than a man, hat in hand, t ook her pl ace. A prisoner was \nled up to the empty place be side me, and the two started a brisk exchange of \nremarks—not loud, however, as the room  had becom e relatively quiet. Someon e \ncame and called away the m an on my right, and his wife shouted at him —she didn’t \nseem to realize it was no longer nece ssary to shout—“N ow, m ind you l ook after \nyourself, dear, and don’t do anything rash!” \nMy turn came next. Marie threw me a kiss. I looke d back as I walked away. She \nhadn’t moved; her face was still pressed to the rails, her li ps still parted in that tense, \ntwisted smile. \nSoon after this I had a letter from  her. And it was then that the things I’ve never \nliked to ta lk about began. Not that they we re particularly terrible; I’ve no wish t o \nexaggerate and I suffered less than others . Still, there was one thing in those early  \ndays that was really irksom e: my habit of  thinking like a fr ee man. F or instance, I  \nwould suddenly be seized with a desire to go dow n to the beach for a  swim. And \nmerely to have imagined the sound of ripples at my feet, the smooth feel of the water \non m y body as I st ruck out, and the wonderfu l sensation of relie f it gave brought \nhome still more cruelly the narrowness of my cell. \nStill, that phase lasted a few m onths only. Afterward, I had prisoner’s thoughts. I \nwaited for the daily walk in th e courtyard or a visi t from my lawyer. As for t he rest \nof the ti me, I managed qui te well, rea lly. I’ve often t hought that  had I been \ncompelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but gaze up at t he \npatch of sky just overhead, I’d have got used to it by degrees. I’d have learned to \nwatch for the passing of birds or drift ing clouds, as I had come to watch for m y \nlawyer’s odd neckties, or, in another world, to wait patiently till Sunday for a spell of \nlove-making with Marie. Well, here, anyhow, I wasn’t penned in a hollow tree trunk. \nThere were others in the world worse off than I. I rem embered it had been one of \n 48\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nMother’s pet ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one gets used to \nanything. \nUsually, however, I didn’t thi nk things out so  far. Those first  months were trying, \nof course; but the very effort I had to ma ke helped me through them. For instanc e, I \nwas plagued by the desire for a woman—wh ich was natural enough,  considering my \nage. I never thought  of Marie especially . I was obsessed by t houghts of this wom an \nor that, of all the ones I’d had, all the circumstances under which I’d loved them ; so \nmuch so that the cell grew crowded with their faces, ghosts of m y old passions. That \nunsettled me, no doubt; but, at least, it served to kill time. \nI gradually became quite friendly with th e chief jailer, who went the rounds with \nthe kitchen hands at m ealtimes. It was he who brought up t he subject of women. \n“That’s what the men here grumble about most,” he told me. \nI said I felt like that m yself. “There’s so mething unfair about it,” I added, “like \nhitting a man when he’s down.” \n“But that’s the whole point of it,” he sa id; “that’s why you fellows are kept in \nprison.” \n“I don’t follow.” \n“Liberty,” he said, “means that. You’re being deprived of your liberty.” \nIt had never before struck me in that light, but I saw his point. “That’s true,” I said. \n“Otherwise it wouldn’t be a punishment.” \nThe jailer nodded. “Yes, you’re  different, you can use your brains. The others  \ncan’t. Still, those fellows find a way out; they do it by them selves.” With which \nremark the jailer left my cell. Next day I did like the others. \nThe lack of cigarettes, too, was a trial. When I was brought to the prison, they took \naway my  belt, my  shoelaces, and the contents of m y pockets, including m y \ncigarettes. Once I had been given a cell to m yself I asked to be given back, anyhow, \nthe cigarettes. Sm oking was fo rbidden, they informed me . That, p erhaps, was what  \ngot m e down the most; i n fact, I suffered really badly duri ng the fi rst few days. I \neven tore off spli nters from my plank bed and sucked them. All day long I felt faint \nand bilious. It passed my understanding why I shouldn’t be allowed even to smoke; it \ncould have done no one any harm. Later on, I understo od the idea behind it; this \nprivation, too, was part of m y punishment. But, by the time I underst ood, I’d lost the \ncraving, so it had ceased to be a punishment. \nExcept for these privations I wasn’t t oo unhappy. Yet again, the whole problem \nwas: how to kill time. After a while, however, once I’d learned t he trick of \nremembering things, I never ha d a moment’s boredom. Sometimes I would exercise \nmy mem ory on m y bedroom  and, starting from a corner, make the round, not ing \nevery object I saw on the way. At first it was over in a minute or two. But each time I \nrepeated the experience, it took a little longe r. I m ade a point of visualizing every \npiece of furniture, and each article upon or in  it, and then every detail of each article, \n 49\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nand finall y the details of th e details, so to speak: a tiny dent or incrustation, or a  \nchipped edge, and the exact grain and colo r of t he woodwork. At the sam e time I \nforced myself to keep m y inventory in m ind from start to fi nish, in the right order \nand omitting no item. With the result that, after a few weeks, I could spend hours \nmerely in listing the  objects in m y bedroom . I found t hat the m ore I thought, t he \nmore details, half-forgotten or m alobserved, floated up from m y mem ory. There \nseemed no end to them. \nSo I learned that ev en after a single da y’s experience of the outside world a man \ncould easily live a hundred years in pri son. He’d have laid up enough mem ories \nnever to be bored. Obviously, in one way, this was a compensation. \nThen there was sleep. To begin with, I slep t badly at night and never in the day. \nBut gradually my nights became better, and I m anaged to doze off in the daytime as \nwell. In fact, during the last months, I must  have slept sixteen or eighteen hours out \nof the twenty-four. So there remained only si x hours to fill —with meals, relieving \nnature, my memories ... and the story of the Czech. \nOne day, when inspecting m y straw mattre ss, I found a bit of newspaper stuck to \nits underside. The p aper was yellow with ag e, alm ost transparent, but I could still \nmake out the letter print. It was the story of  a crime. The first part was mi ssing, but I \ngathered that its scene was so me village in Czechoslovakia. One of the villagers had  \nleft his home to try his luck  abroad. After twenty-five year s, having made a fortune, \nhe returned to his country wit h his wife and child. Meanwhile his mother and sister  \nhad been running a small hotel in the village  where he was born. He decided to give \nthem a surprise and, leaving hi s wife and child  in another inn, he went to stay at his \nmother’s place, booking a room  under an assumed nam e. His m other and sister  \ncompletely failed to recognize him . At di nner that evening he showed them  a large \nsum of money he had on him, and in the c ourse of the night  they slaughtered him \nwith a hammer. After taking the m oney they  flung the body int o t he river. Next  \nmorning his wife came and, without thi nking, betrayed the guest’s identity. His \nmother hanged herself. His sister threw hers elf into a well. I m ust have read th at \nstory t housands of t imes. In one way it s ounded m ost unlikely; in another, it was \nplausible enough. Anyhow, to m y m ind, th e m an was asking for trouble; one \nshouldn’t play fool tricks of that sort. \nSo, what with long bouts of sleep, my memories, readings of that  scrap of \nnewspaper, the tides of light  and darkness, the days sli pped by. I’d read, of course, \nthat in jail  one ends up by losi ng track of  time. But this had never m eant anything \ndefinite to me. I hadn’t grasped how days could be at once long and short. Long, no \ndoubt, as periods to live thro ugh, but so distended that they ended up by overlapping \non each other. In fact, I never thought of days as such; only the words “yesterday” \nand “tomorrow” still kept some meaning. \n 50\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nWhen, one m orning, the jailer inform ed me  I’d now been six m onths in jail, I \nbelieved him—but t he words conveyed nothi ng to my mind. To me it seemed like \none and the same day that had been going on since I’d been in my cell, and that I’d \nbeen doing the same thing all the time. \nAfter the jailer left me I shined up m y tin pannikin and studied my face in it. My  \nexpression was terribly serious, I thought, even when I tried to sm ile. I held the \npannikin at different angles, but always my face had the same mournful, t ense \nexpression. \nThe sun was setting and it was the hour of which I’d rat her not  speak—“the \nnameless hour,” I called it—when evening sounds were creeping up from  all the  \nfloors of the prison in a sort of stealthy procession. I went to the barred window and \nin the last rays looked once again at my re flected face. It was as serious as before; \nand that wasn’t surprising, as just then I was feeling serious. But, at the same ti me, I \nheard something that I hadn’t heard for months. It w as the sound of a voi ce; my own \nvoice, there was no mistaking it. And I recognized it as the voice that for many a day \nof late had been sounding i n my ears. So I knew that all this time I’d been talking to  \nmyself. \nAnd something I’d been told c ame back; a remark made by t he nurse at Mother’s \nfuneral. No, there was no way out, and no one can imagine what the evenings are like \nin prison. \n 51\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nIII \nON THE whole I can’t say that those mo nths passed slowly; another summer was on \nits way alm ost before I realized the firs t was over. And I knew that with the first \nreally hot days som ething new was in st ore for me. My case was down for the last \nsessions of the Assize Court, and those sessions were due to end some time in June. \nThe day on which m y trial started was one of brilliant sunshine. My lawy er \nassured me the case would ta ke only t wo or  three days. “From what I hear,” h e \nadded, “the court wi ll dispatch your case as quickly as possible, as it isn’t the most \nimportant one on the Cause List. There’s a case of parricide immediately after, which \nwill take them some time.” \nThey came for me at half-past seven in the morning and I was conveyed to the law \ncourts in a  prison van. The two policemen led me into a sm all room that sm elled of \ndarkness. We sat near a door through w hich came sounds of voices, shouts, chairs \nscraping on the floor; a vague hubbub whic h reminded me of one of those small-\ntown “socials” when, after the concert’s over, the hall is cleared for dancing. \nOne of my policemen told me the judges  hadn’t arrived yet,  and offered m e a \ncigarette, which I declined. After a bit he asked me if I was feeling nervous. I said, \n“No,” and that the prospect of witnessing a trial rather interest ed me; I’d never had \noccasion to attend one before. \n“Maybe,” the other policeman said. “But after an hour or two one’s had enough of \nit.” \nAfter a while a small electric bell pu rred in the room . They unfastened my \nhandcuffs, opened the door, and led me to the prisoner’s dock. \nThere was a great crowd in t he courtr oom. Though the Venetian bli nds were \ndown, light was filtering through the chinks , and the air stiflingly hot already. The \nwindows had been kept shut. I sat down, and the police offi cers took t heir stand on \neach side of my chair. \nIt was then that I noticed a row of fa ces opposite me. These people were staring \nhard at m e, and I guessed they were th e jury. But somehow I didn’t see them as  \nindividuals. I felt as you do j ust after boarding a streetcar and you’re conscious of all \nthe people on t he opposite seat staring at  you in t he hope of findi ng something i n \nyour appearance to am use them. Of course , I knew this was an absurd com parison; \nwhat these people were looking for i n me wasn’t anything to la ugh at, but signs of \ncriminality. Still, the difference wasn’t so very great, and, anyhow, that’s the idea I \ngot. \nWhat with the crowd and the stuffi ness of the air I was feeli ng a bit dizzy. I ran  \nmy eyes round the courtroom but couldn’t recognize any of the faces. At first I could \nhardly bel ieve that all these people had come on m y account. It was such a new \n 52\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nexperience, being a focus of interest; in the ordinary way no one ever paid m uch \nattention to me. \n“What a crush!” I remarked to the policeman  on my left, and he explained that the  \nnewspapers were responsible for it. \nHe pointed to a group of men at a table just below the jury box. “There they are!” \n“Who?” I asked, and he replied, “The pre ss.” One of them, he added, was an old \nfriend of his. \nA moment later the man he’d mentioned looked our way and, com ing to the dock, \nshook hands warm ly with the policem an. The journalist was an elderly man with a \nrather grim expression, but his m anner was quite pleasant. Just then I noticed that \nalmost all the people in the courtroom  were greeting each other, exchanging remarks \nand forming groups—behaving, in fact, as in  a club where the com pany of others of \none’s own tastes and standing makes one feel at ease. Th at, no doubt, explained the \nodd impression I had of being de trop here, a sort of gate-crasher. \nHowever, the journal ist addressed me qui te amiably, and said  he hoped all would \ngo well for me. I thanked him, and he added with a smile: \n“You know, we’ve been featuring you a  bit. We’re always rather short  of copy i n \nthe summer, and there’s been precious little  to write about except your case and the \none that’s coming on after it. I expect you’ve heard about it; it’s a case of parricide.” \nHe drew m y attention to one of the group at the press table, a plum p, small m an \nwith huge black-rimmed glasses, who made me think of an overfed weasel. \n“That fellow’s the special correspondent of one of the Pa ris dailies. As a matter of \nfact, he didn’t come on your account. He was sent for the parricide case, but they’ve \nasked him to cover yours as well.” \nIt was on the tip of m y tongue to say, “T hat was very kind of them ,” but then I \nthought i t would sound sil ly. With a fri endly wave of his hand he left us, and for \nsome minutes nothing happened. \nThen, accom panied by som e colleagues, m y lawyer bustled in, in his gown. He \nwent up t o the press table and shook hands  with the journalists. They remained  \nlaughing and chatting together, all seemingl y very m uch at home here, until a bell \nrang shrilly and everyone went to his pla ce. My lawyer came up to m e, shook hands, \nand advised me to answer a ll the questions as bri efly as possible, not  to volunt eer \ninformation, and to rely on him to see me through. \nI heard a chair scrape on my left, and a tall, thin man wearing pince-nez settled the \nfolds of his red gown as he took his seat. The Public Prosecutor, I gathered. A cl erk \nof the court announced that Their Honors were entering, and at the same moment two \nbig electric fans started buzzing overhead. Three judges, two in black and the third i n \nscarlet, with brief cases under their arm s, entered and walked briskly to the bench, \nwhich was several feet above  the level of the court room floor. The man in scarlet \ntook the central, high-backed chair, placed his cap of office on the table, ran a \n 53\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nhandkerchief over hi s small bald crown, and announced that t he hearing would now \nbegin. \nThe journalists had their fountain pens ready; they all wore the same expression of \nslightly ironical indi fference, with the exception of one , a much younger man than  \nhis colleagues, in gray flannels with a blue tie, who, leaving his pen on the table, was \ngazing hard at me. He had a plain, rather  chunky face; what h eld my attention were \nhis eyes, very pale, clear eyes, rivete d on me, though not betraying any definite  \nemotion. For a m oment I had an odd im pression, as if I were being scrutinized by \nmyself. That—and the fact that I was unfam iliar with court procedure—may explain \nwhy I didn’t follow very well the opening phases: the drawing of lots for the jury, the \nvarious questions put by t he presiding judge  to the  Prosecutor, the fore man of the \njury, and m y counsel (eac h time he spoke all the jurym en’s heads swung round \ntogether toward the bench), th e hurried reading of the char ge sheet, in the course of \nwhich I recognized some fam iliar name s of people and places; then some \nsupplementary questions put to my lawyer. \nNext, the Judge announced that the court would call over the witness list. Some of \nthe names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. From amongst the crowd, which \nuntil now I had seen  as a mer e blur of faces, rose, one after  the other, Ray mond, \nMasson, Salamano, the doorkeeper from  the Home, old Pérez, a nd Marie, who gave \nme a little nervous wave of he r hand before following the others out by a side door. I \nwas thinking how strange it was I hadn’t noticed any of them before when I heard the \nlast name called, that of Céleste. As he rose, I noticed  beside him the quaint little \nwoman with a mannish coat a nd brisk, decided air, who ha d shared my table at  the \nrestaurant. She had her eyes fixed on me , I noticed. But I hadn’t tim e to wonder \nabout her; the Judge had started speaking again. \nHe said that the trial  proper was about t o begin, a nd he need hardl y say that he  \nexpected the public to refrain from any demonstration whatsoever. He explained t hat \nhe was there to supervise the proceedings, as  a sort of umpire, and he would take a \nscrupulously impartial view of the case. The verdict of the jury would be interpreted \nby him in a spirit of justice. Finally, at th e least sign of a disturbance he would have \nthe court cleared. \nThe day was stoking up. Some of the public w ere fanning them selves with \nnewspapers, and there was a c onstant rustle of crum pled paper. On a sign from  the \npresiding judge the clerk of the  court bro ught three fans of pl aited straw, which the \nthree judges promptly put in action. \nMy examination began at once. The Judge questioned me quite calmly and even, I \nthought, with a hint of cordiali ty. For the nth time I was asked to gi ve particulars of \nmy identity and, though heartily sick of this  formality, I realized that it was natural \nenough; after all, it would be  a shocking thing for the court to be trying the wrong \nman. \n 54\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nThe Judge then launched into an account of what I’d done, stopping after every \ntwo or three sentences to ask me, “Is that correct?” To which I always replied, “Yes,  \nsir,” as my lawyer had advised me. It wa s a long business, as the Judge  lingered on \neach detail. Meanwhile the journalists sc ribbled busily away. But I was so metimes \nconscious of the eyes of the youngest fixe d on me; also those of the queer little robot \nwoman. The jurymen, however, were all g azing at the red-robed judge, and I was \nagain reminded of the row of passengers on on e side of a tram. Presently he gave a  \nslight cough, turned some p ages of his fi le, and, still fanning his face, addressed me \ngravely. \nHe now proposed, he said, to trench on certain matters which, on a superficial \nview, mig ht seem foreign to the cas e, b ut actually were highly relevant. I guessed \nthat he was going to talk about Mother, and at the same moment realized how odious \nI would find this. His first question was: Why had I sent my mother to an institution? \nI replied that the reason was sim ple; I hadn’t enough m oney to see that she was \nproperly l ooked aft er at home. Then he asked if the parti ng hadn’t  caused me \ndistress. I explained that neither Mother nor I expected much of one another—or, for \nthat matter, of anybody else; so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily \nenough. The Judge t hen said t hat he had no wish t o press the point, and asked t he \nProsecutor if he coul d think of any m ore questions that should be put to me at this \nstage. \nThe Prosecutor, who had his back half turn ed to me, said, without  looking i n my \ndirection, that, subject to His Honor’s a pproval, he would li ke to know if I’d gone \nback to the stream with the intention of killing the Arab. I said, “No .” In that case , \nwhy had I taken a revolver wit h me, and why go ba ck precisely to that spot? I said it \nwas a mat ter of pure chance . The Prosecutor then observed in a nasty tone: “Very \ngood. That will be all for the present.” \nI couldn’t quite follow what came next. Anyhow, after some palavering among the \nbench, the Prosecutor, and m y counsel, the presiding judge announced that the court  \nwould now rise; there was an adjournm ent till the afternoon,  when evidence would \nbe taken. \nAlmost before I knew what was happening I was rushed out  to the pri son van, \nwhich drove m e back, and I was given m y m idday m eal. After a sh ort tim e, just \nenough for me to realize how tired I was feeli ng, they came for me. I was back in the \nsame room, confronting the same faces, a nd the whole thing started again. But the \nheat had meanwhile much in creased, and by some miracl e fans had been procured \nfor everyone: the jury, m y lawyer, the Pros ecutor, and som e of the journalists, too. \nThe young m an and the robot wom an were still at their places. Bu t they were not \nfanning themselves and, as before, they never took their eyes off me. \nI wiped the sweat from my face, but I was barely conscious of where or who I was \nuntil I heard the warden of the Home called  to the witness box. When asked if my \n 55\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nmother had com plained about  m y conduct, he said, “Yes,” but that didn’t mean \nmuch; almost all the inmates of the Ho me had grievances against their re latives. The \nJudge asked him to be more explicit; did she reproach me with having sent her to the \nHome, and he said, “Yes,” again. But this time he didn’t qualify his answer. \nTo another question he replied that on th e day of the funeral he was somewhat \nsurprised by m y calmness. Asked to expl ain what he meant by “my calmn ess,” the \nwarden lowered his eyes and s tared at hi s shoes for a m oment. Then he explained \nthat I hadn’t wanted to see Mother’s body, or shed a single tear , and that I’d left \nimmediately the funeral ende d, without lingering at he r gra ve. Another thing had \nsurprised him. One of the un dertaker’s men told him that I didn’t know m y mother’s \nage. There was a short silence; then the J udge asked him  if he m ight take it that he \nwas referring to the prisoner in the dock. The warden seemed puzzled by this, and the \nJudge explained: “It’s a formal question. I am bound to put it.” \nThe Prosecutor was then asked if he had any questions to put, and he answered \nloudly: “Certainly not! I have  all I want .” His tone and the look of tri umph on his \nface, as he glanced at me, wer e so marked that I felt as I hadn’t felt for ages. I had a \nfoolish desire to burst into tears. For th e first time I ’d realized how all t hese people \nloathed me. \nAfter asking the jury and my lawyer if they had any questions, the Judge heard the \ndoorkeeper’s evidence. On stepping into th e box the man threw a gl ance at me, then \nlooked away. Replying to questi ons, he said that I’d declin ed to see Mother’s body, \nI’d smoked cigarettes and slept, and drunk café au lait . It was then I felt a sort of \nwave of indignation spreading through the court room, and for the first t ime I \nunderstood that I was guilt y. They got the doorkeeper to repeat what he had said \nabout the coffee and my smoking. \nThe Prosecutor turned to m e again, with  a gloati ng look i n his eyes. My counsel \nasked the doorkeeper if he, too, hadn’t  smoked. But the Prosecutor took strong \nexception to this. “I’d like to know,” he cr ied indignantly, “who is on trial in this \ncourt. Or does my friend think that by aspersing a witness for the prosecution he will \nshake the evidence, the abundant and cogent  evidence, against hi s client?” None the \nless, the Judge told the doorkeeper to answer the question. \nThe old fellow fidgeted a bit. Then, “Well, I know I didn’t ought t o have done it,” \nhe mumbled, “but I did take  a cigarette from  the young gentleman when he offered \nit—just out of politeness.” \nThe Judge asked me if I had any comment  to make. “None,” I said, “except that \nthe witness is quite right. It’s true I offered him a cigarette.” \nThe doorkeeper looked at m e with surprise  and a sort of gratitude. Then, after \nhemming and hawing for a bit , he volunteered the statement that it was he who’d \nsuggested I should have some coffee. \n 56\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nMy lawyer was exultant. “The jury will appreciate,” he said, “the im portance of \nthis admission.” \nThe Prosecutor, how ever, was prom ptly on hi s feet again. “Quite so,” he boom ed \nabove our heads. “The jury will appreciate it. And they will draw the conclusion that, \nthough a third part y might inadvertently offe r him a cup of coffee, the prisoner, in \ncommon decency, should have re fused it, if only out  of respect for the dead body of \nthe poor woman who had brought him into the world.” \nAfter which the doorkeeper went back to his seat. \nWhen Thomas Pérez was called,  a court officer had. to help him  to the box. Pérez \nstated that, though he had been a great friend of m y m other, he had met me once \nonly, on the day of the funeral. Asked how I had behaved that day, he said: \n“Well, I was most upset, you know. Far t oo much upset to notice things. My grief \nsort of blinded me, I think. It had been a gr eat shock, my dear friend’s death; in fact, \nI fainted during the funeral. So I didn’t hardly notice the young gentleman at all.” \nThe Prosecutor asked him  to tell the court if he’d seen me weep. And when Pérez \nanswered, “No,” added emphatically: “I trust the jury will take note of this reply.” \nMy lawyer rose at o nce, and asked Pérez in a tone that seemed to me needlessly \naggressive: \n“Now, think well, my man! Can you swear you saw he didn’t shed a tear?” \nPérez answered, “No.” \nAt this some people tittered, and my lawyer, pushing back one sleeve of his gown, \nsaid sternly: \n“That is typical of the way this case is be ing conducted. No attempt is being made \nto elicit the true facts.” \nThe Prosecutor ignored this remark; he was making dabs w ith hi s pencil on t he \ncover of his brief, seemingly quite indifferent. \nThere was a break of five min utes, during which my lawyer told me the case was  \ngoing very well indeed. Then Céleste was called. He was announced as a witness for \nthe defense. The defense meant me. \nNow and again Céleste threw me a glance; he kept squeezing hi s Panam a hat  \nbetween his hands a s he gave evidence. He  was in his best suit, the one he wore \nwhen sometimes of a Sunday he went with me to the races. But evidently he hadn’t \nbeen able to get his collar on; the top of his shirt, I noticed, was secured only by a \nbrass stud. Asked if I was one of his custom ers, he said, “Yes, and a friend as well.”  \nAsked to state his opinion of me, he said that I was “all right” and, when told to \nexplain what he meant by that, he replied that everyone knew what that meant. “Was \nI a secretive sort of man?” “No,” he answered, “I shouldn’t call him that. But he isn’t \none to waste his breath, like a lot of folks.” \nThe Prosecutor asked him  if I always se ttled m y m onthly bill at his restauran t \nwhen he presented it. Céleste laughed. “Oh, he paid on the nail, all right. But the bills \n 57\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwere just details-like, between him  and me .” Then he was asked to say what he \nthought about the crime. He placed his hands on t he rail of the box and one could see \nhe had a speech all ready. \n“To my mind it was just an accident, or a stroke of bad luck, if you prefer. And a \nthing like that takes you off your guard.” \nHe wanted to continue, but the Judge cut him short. “Quite so. That’s all, thank \nyou.” \nFor a bit Cél este seemed flabbergasted; th en he explained t hat he hadn’t fi nished \nwhat he wanted to say. They told him to continue, but to make it brief. \nHe only repeated that it was “just an accident.” \n“That’s as it may be,” the Judge observed. “But what we are here for is to try such  \naccidents, according to law. You can stand down.” \nCéleste turned and gazed at me. His eyes were moist and his lips trembling. It was \nexactly as if he’d said: “Well, I’ve done my best for you, old man. I’m  afraid it \nhasn’t helped much. I’m sorry.” \nI didn’t say anything, or m ake any m ovement, but for the first tim e in m y life I \nwanted to kiss a man. \nThe Judge repeated his order to stand down, and Céleste returned to his place \namongst the crowd. During t he rest of th e hearing he remained there, leaning \nforward, elbows on knees and his Panama between his hands, not m issing a word of \nthe proceedings. \nIt was Marie’s turn next. She had a hat on and still looked qu ite pretty, though I \nmuch preferred her with her hair free. From  where I was I had glim pses of the soft \ncurve of her breasts, and her underlip ha d the little pout that always fascinated me. \nShe appeared very nervous. \nThe first question was: How long had sh e known me? Since the time when she \nwas in our office, she replied. Then the Judge asked her what were the relations \nbetween us, and she said she was m y girl friend. Answering a nother question, she \nadmitted promising to marry me. The Prosecutor, who had been studying a document \nin front of him, asked her rather sharply when our “liaison” had begun. She gave the \ndate. He then observed with a would-be cas ual air that apparently she meant the day \nfollowing m y mother’s funeral.  After letting this sink in he rem arked in a slightly \nironic t one that obviousl y thi s was a “delicate topic” and he could enter int o t he \nyoung lady’s feelings, but—and here his voice grew sterner—his duty obliged him to \nwaive considerations of delicacy. \nAfter m aking this announcem ent he asked Marie to gi ve a full account of our \ndoings on the day when I had “intercours e” with her for the first time. Marie \nwouldn’t answer at first, but the Prosecutor insisted, and then she told him that  we \nhad met at the baths, gone together to the pictures, and then to m y place. He then \ninformed the court that, as a result of certain st atements made by Marie at t he \n 58\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nproceedings before the magistrate, he had studied the movie prog rams of that date, \nand turning to Marie asked her to nam e the film that we had gone to see. In a very \nlow voice she said it was a pict ure with Fernandel in it. By the time she had finished, \nthe courtroom was so still you could have heard a pin drop. \nLooking very grave, the Prosecutor drew himself up to his ful l height and, \npointing at me, said in such a tone that I could have sworn he was genuinely moved: \n“Gentlemen of the jury, I would have you note t hat on the next day after his \nmother’s funeral that man was visiti ng the swimming pool, st arting a li aison with a \ngirl, and going to see a comic film. That is all I wish to say.” \nWhen he sat down there was t he same d ead silence. Then all of a sudden Marie  \nburst into tears. He’d got it all  wrong, she said; it wasn’t a bit like that  really, he’d \nbullied her into saying the opposite of what  she meant. She knew me very well, and  \nshe was sure I hadn’t done anything rea lly wrong—and so on. At a sign from  the \npresiding judge, one of the court officers led her away, and the hearing continued. \nHardly anyone seemed to listen to Masson, the next witness. He stated that I was a \nrespectable young fellow; “and, what’s more, a very decent ch ap.” Nor did they pa y \nany more attention to Salaman o, when he told them how kind I’d always been t o his \ndog, or when, in answer to a question a bout m y m other and m yself, he said that \nMother and I had ve ry little in common and that explaine d why I’d fixe d up for her \nto enter t he Home. “You’ve got  to unde rstand,” he added.  “Y ou’ve got  to \nunderstand.” But no one seemed to understand. He was told to stand down. \nRaymond was the next, and last, witness. He gave me a little wave of his hand and \nled off by saying I was innocent. The Judge rebuked him. \n“You are here to give evidence, not your  views on the case, and you m ust confine \nyourself to answering the questions put you.” \nHe was then asked t o make cl ear his re lations with the de ceased, and Raym ond \ntook this opportunity of explaining t hat it was he, not I, against  whom the dead man \nhad a grudge, because he, Raymond, had beaten up his sister. The judge asked him if \nthe deceased had no reason to  dislike me, too. Raym ond told him that m y presence \non the beach that morning was a pure coincidence. \n“How comes it then,” the Prosecutor i nquired, “that the letter which led up t o this \ntragedy was the prisoner’s work?” \nRaymond replied that this, too, was due to mere chance. \nTo which the Prosecutor retorted that in this case “chance” or “mere coincidence” \nseemed to play a remarkably large part. Was it b y chance t hat I hadn’t intervened  \nwhen Raym ond assaulted his m istress? Did this convenient term  “chance” account  \nfor my having vouc hed for Raym ond at the police station and having made, on that \noccasion, statements extravagantly favor able to him? I n conclusion he asked  \nRaymond to state what were his means of livelihood. \n 59\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nOn his describing hi mself as a warehousem an, the Prosecutor in formed the jury it \nwas common knowledge that the witness lived on the immoral earnings of women. I, \nhe said, was this m an’s intimate friend and associate; in fact, the whole background \nof the crime was of the most squalid description. And what made it even more odious \nwas the personality of the prisoner, an inhuman m onster wholly without a m oral \nsense. \nRaymond began to expostulate, and my lawyer, too, protested. They were told that \nthe Prosecutor must be allowed to finish his remarks. \n“I have nearly done,” he said; then tu rned to Raym ond. “Was the prisoner your \nfriend?” \n“Certainly. We were the best of pals, as they say.” \nThe Prosecutor then put me the same ques tion. I looked hard at Raymond, and he \ndid not turn away. \nThen, “Yes,” I answered. \nThe Prosecutor turned toward the jury. \n“Not only did the man before you in the do ck indulge in the most shamef ul orgies \non the day following his m other’s death.  He killed a man cold-bloodedly, in \npursuance of some sordid vendetta in the underworld of prostitutes and pimps. That, \ngentlemen of the jury, is the type of man the prisoner is.” \nNo sooner had he sat  down than my lawyer, out of all patience, raised his arm s so \nhigh that his sleeves fell back, showing the full length of his starched shirt cuffs. \n“Is my client on trial for having buried his mother, or for killing a man?” he asked. \nThere were so me titters in court. But then  the Prosecutor sprang to his feet and, \ndraping hi s gown round him , said he was amazed at his fri end’s ingenuousness in \nfailing to see that between these two elements of the case there was a vital link. They \nhung together psyc hologically, if he m ight put  it so. “In short,” he concluded, \nspeaking with great vehemence, “I accuse the prisoner of behaving at his m other’s \nfuneral in a way that showed he was already a criminal at heart.” \nThese words seemed to take much effect on the jury and public. My lawyer merely \nshrugged his shoulders and wiped the sweat from his forehead. But obviously he was \nrattled, and I had a feeling things weren’t going well for me. \nSoon after this incident the court rose. As I was being taken from the courthouse to \nthe prison van, I was conscious for a few brief moments of the once familiar feel of a \nsummer evening out-of-doors.  And, sitting in the darkness of m y m oving cell, I \nrecognized, echoing in m y tired brain, all the characteristic soun ds of a town I’d \nloved, and of a certain hour of t he day which I had always particularly enjoyed. The \nshouts of newspaper boys i n t he already langui d air, the last calls of birds i n the \npublic garden, the cries of sa ndwich vendors, the screech of streetcars at the st eep \ncorners of the upper town, and that faint rustling overhead as darkness sifted dow n \n 60\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nupon t he harbor—all these sounds m ade m y return to pri son like a blind m an’s \njourney along a route whose every inch he knows by heart. \nYes, this was the evening hour when—how  long ago it seemed!—I always felt so \nwell content with life. Then, what awaited me was a night of easy, dream less sleep. \nThis was the sam e h our, but w ith a differe nce; I was returning to a cell, and what \nawaited me was a night haunt ed by forebodings of t he coming day. And so I learned \nthat familiar paths traced in the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prisons \nas to innocent, untroubled sleep. \n 61"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nIV \nIT is always interesting, even in the pr isoner’s doc k, to hear oneself being talked \nabout. And certainly in the speech es of my lawyer and the prosecuting counse l a \ngreat deal was said about m e; m ore, in fact, about m e personally than about m y \ncrime. \nReally there wasn’t any very great di fference between the two speeches . Counsel \nfor the defense raised his arm s to heav en and pleaded guilty, but with e xtenuating \ncircumstances. The Prosecutor made similar gestures; he agreed that I was guilty, but \ndenied extenuating circumstances. \nOne thing about thi s phase of t he trial was rather irksome. Quite often, interested \nas I was in what they had to say, I was tempted to put in a word, m yself. But m y \nlawyer had advised me not to. “You won’t do your case any good by talking,” he had \nwarned me. In fact, there seemed to be  a conspiracy to exclude me from the \nproceedings; I wasn’t to have any say and my fate was to be decided out of hand. \nIt was quite an effort at times for m e to refrain from  cutting them all short, and \nsaying: “But, damn it all, who’s on trial in this court, I’d like to know? It’s a serious \nmatter for a man, bei ng accused of murder. And I’ve so mething really important to \ntell you.” \nHowever, on second thoughts,  I found I had not hing to sa y. In any case, I must  \nadmit that hearing oneself talked about lose s its interest very soon. The Prosecutor’s \nspeech, especially, began to bore me befo re he was halfway through it. The onl y \nthings tha t really caught m y attention we re occasional phrases, his gestures, and \nsome elaborate tirades—but these were isolated patches. \nWhat he was aiming at, I gathered, was to show that my crime was premeditated. I \nremember his saying at one m oment, “I can prove this, gentlemen of the jury, to the \nhilt. First, you have the facts of the crime;  which are as clear as daylight. And then \nyou have what I m ay call the night  side of this case, the dark workings of a crim inal \nmentality.” \nHe began by summ ing up the facts, from  my mother’s death onward. He stressed \nmy heartlessness, my inability to state Mother’s age, m y visit to the swimming pool \nwhere I met Marie, our matinee at the pictures where a Fernandel film was showing, \nand finally m y return with Marie to m y rooms. I didn’t  quite foll ow his remarks at \nfirst, as he kept on mentioning “the prisoner’s mistress,” whereas for me she was just \n“Marie.” Then he came to the subject of Ra ymond. It seemed to m e that his way of \ntreating the facts showed a certain shrewdne ss. All he said sounded quite plausible. \nI’d written the letter in collusion with Raym ond so as to entice his mistress to his \nroom and subject her to ill -treatment by a man “of more than dubious reputation.” \nThen, on the beach, I’d provok ed a brawl with Raym ond’s enemies, in the course of \n 62\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwhich Raym ond was wounde d. I’d asked him  for his revolver and gone back by \nmyself with the intention of using it. Then  I’d shot the Arab. After the first shot I \nwaited. Then, “to be certain of m aking a good j ob of it,” I fired four m ore shots \ndeliberately, point-blank, and in cold blood, at my victim. \n“That is my case,” he said. “I have descri bed to you the series of events which led  \nthis man to kill the deceased, fully aware of wh at he was doing. I em phasize this \npoint. We are not concerned with an act  of homicide committed on a sudden im pulse \nwhich might serve as extenuation. I ask you to  note, gentlemen of the jury, that t he \nprisoner is an educated man. You will  have observed the way in which he answered \nmy questions; he is intelligent and he knows the value of wo rds. And I repeat that it \nis quite im possible to assu me that, wh en he committed the cri me, he was  unaware \nwhat he was doing.” \nI noticed that he laid stress on m y “intelligence.” It puzzled me rather why what \nwould count as a good point in an ordinary  person should be used against an accus ed \nman as an  overwhelming proof of his guilt. While thinking this over, I m issed what \nhe said next, until I heard him exclaim  indignantly: “And has he uttered a word of \nregret for his most odious crime? Not one word, gentlemen. Not once in the course of \nthese proceedings did this man show the least contrition.” \nTurning t oward the dock, he  poi nted a  finger at me, and went on i n the same \nstrain. I really couldn’t understand why he harped on this point so much. Of course, I \nhad to own that he was right; I didn’t feel much regret for what I’d done. Still, to my  \nmind he overdid it, and I’d have liked to ha ve a chance of explaining to him , in a \nquite friendly, alm ost affectionate way, that  I have never been able really t o regret \nanything i n all m y life. I’ve always been  far too much ab sorbed in the present \nmoment, or the immediate future, to think back. Of course, in the position into which \nI had been forced, there was no question of  my speaking to anyone in that tone. I \nhadn’t the right to show any friendly fee ling or possess good inte ntions. And I tried \nto follow what came next, as the Prosecutor was now cons idering what he called m y \n“soul.” \nHe said he’d studied it closely—and had found a blank, “literally nothing,  \ngentlemen of the jury.” Really, he said, I had no soul, there was nothing human about \nme, not one of those moral qualities which normal men possess had any place in my  \nmentality. “No doubt,” he  added, “we should not re proach him with this. We cannot \nblame a man for lacking what it was never in  his power to acq uire. But in a criminal \ncourt the wholly pa ssive ideal of tolerance m ust give place to a sterner, loftier ideal , \nthat of justice. Especially when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the \nman before you, a menace to  society.” He proceeded to  discuss m y conduct toward \nmy mother, repeating what he had said in th e course of the hearing. But he spoke  at \nmuch greater length of my crime— at such length, indeed, that I lost the thread and \nwas conscious only of the steadily increasing heat. \n 63\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nA moment came wh en the Pros ecutor paused and, after a short silence, said in a \nlow, vibrant voice: “This sam e court, gen tlemen, will be called on to try tom orrow \nthat most odious of cri mes, the murder of a father  by hi s son.” To his m ind, such a \ncrime was alm ost unimaginable. But, he ve ntured to hope, j ustice would be meted \nout without paltering. And yet, he made bold to say, the horror that even the crime of \nparricide inspired in him paled beside the loathing inspired by my callousness. \n“This man, who is morally guilty of his m other’s death, is no  less unfit to have a \nplace in the co mmunity than that other ma n who did to death the father that begat \nhim. And, indeed, the one crime led on to th e other; the first of these two crim inals, \nthe man in the dock, set a precedent, if I may put it so, and authorized the second \ncrime. Yes, gentlemen, I am  convinced”—here he raised his voice a tone—“that you \nwill not find I am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say that he is also \nguilty of t he m urder to be tried tom orrow in this court. And I look t o you for a \nverdict accordingly.” \nThe Prosecutor paused again, to wipe th e sweat off his face. He then explained \nthat his duty was a painful one, but  he would do it without flinching. “This man has, \nI repeat, no place in a co mmunity whose basic principles he flouts without \ncompunction. Nor, heartless as he is, has he any claim to mercy. I ask you to im pose \nthe extreme penalty of the law; and I ask it without a qualm. In the course of a long \ncareer, in which it has often been m y duty to ask for a capital sentence, never have I \nfelt that painful duty weigh so little on m y mind as in the present case. In demanding \na verdict of m urder without extenuating ci rcumstances, I am following not only t he \ndictates of my conscience a nd a sacred obligation, but also t hose of the  natural and \nrighteous indignation I feel at the sight of  a crimi nal devoid of the least spark of  \nhuman feeling.” \nWhen the Prosecutor sat down there was a longish silen ce. Personally I was quite \novercome by the heat and my amazement  at what I had been hearing. The presidi ng \njudge gave a short cough, and asked m e in a very low tone if I had anything to say. I \nrose, and as I felt in the m ood to speak, I sa id the first t hing that crossed m y mind: \nthat I’d ha d no intention of kil ling the Arab. The Judge repli ed that this statement \nwould be taken into consideration by the court. Meanwhile he would be glad to hear, \nbefore my counsel addressed t he court, what  were the m otives of m y crime. So far, \nhe must admit, he hadn’t fully understood the grounds of my defense. \nI tried to explain that it was because of the sun, but I spoke too quickly and ran my \nwords into each other. I was only too c onscious that it sounded nonsensical, and, in \nfact, I heard people tittering. \nMy lawyer shrugged his shoul ders. Then he was directed to address the  court, in \nhis turn. But all he did was to point out the lateness of the hour and t o ask for an \nadjournment till the following afternoon. To this the judge agreed. \n 64\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nWhen I was brought back next day, the el ectric fans were still churning up the \nheavy air and the jurym en plying their gaudy little fans in a sort of ste ady rhythm. \nThe speech for the defense seemed to m e interminable. At one m oment, however, I \npricked up m y ears; it was wh en I heard hi m saying: “It is true I killed a man .” He \nwent on in the same strain, saying “I” when  he referred to me. It seemed so queer \nthat I bent toward the policeman on my right and asked him to explain. He told me to \nshut up; then, after a moment, whispered: “They all do that.” It seemed to me that the \nidea behind it was still further to exclude me from the case, to put me off the map. so \nto speak, by substituting the lawyer for myself. Anyway, it hardly mattered; I already \nfelt worlds away from this courtroom and its tedious “proceedings.” \nMy lawyer, in any case, struck me as feeb le to the point of being ridic ulous. He \nhurried through his plea of provocation, and th en he, too, started in about m y soul. \nBut I had an impression that he had much less talent than the Prosecutor. \n“I, too,” he said, “have closel y studied this m an’s soul;  but,  unli ke my learned \nfriend for the prosecution, I have found some thing there. Indeed, I may say that I \nhave read the prisoner’s m ind like an open book.” What he had read there was that I \nwas an excellent young fellow, a steady, conscientious worker who did his best  by \nhis employer; that I was popul ar with ever yone and sym pathetic in others’ troubl es. \nAccording to him  I was a dutiful son, w ho had supported hi s mother as long as he \nwas able. After anxious consideration I had reached the conclusion that, by entering a \nhome, the old lady would have com forts that my means didn’t permit me to provide \nfor her. “I am  astounded, gentlemen,” he added, “ by the attitude taken up by m y \nlearned friend in referring to this Home. Surely if proof be needed of the excelle nce \nof such institutions, we need only rem ember that they are prom oted and financed by  \na government department.” I noticed that  he made no reference to  the funeral, and \nthis seemed to me a serious om ission. But, what with his long-windedness, the \nendless days and hours they had been discussing my “soul,” and the rest of it, I found \nthat m y m ind had gone blurred; everything was dissol ving into a grayish, watery \nhaze. \nOnly one incident st ands out ; toward th e end, while m y counsel rambled on, I \nheard the tin trum pet of an ice-cream  ve ndor in the street, a small, shrill sound \ncutting across the flow of words. And then  a rush of m emories went through m y \nmind—memories of a life which was m ine no longer and had once provided me with \nthe surest, humblest pleasures: warm  smells of summer, my favorite streets, the sky \nat evening, Marie’s dresses and her laugh.  The futility of what was happening here \nseemed to take me by the throat, I felt like vomiting, and I had only one idea: to get it \nover, to go back to my cell, and sleep ... and sleep. \nDimly I heard my counsel making his last appeal. \n“Gentlemen of the j ury, surely you wil l not send to his death a decent, hard-\nworking young man, because for one tragic moment he lost his self-control? Is he not \n 65\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nsufficiently punished by the lifelong rem orse that is to be his lot? I confidentl y await \nyour verdict, the only verdict possibl e—that of hom icide with extenuating \ncircumstances.” \nThe court rose, and the lawyer sat down,  looking thoroughly exhausted. Some of \nhis colleagues came to him and shook his hand. “You put up a magnificent show, old \nman,” I heard one of them  say. Another la wyer even called me to witness: “Fine, \nwasn’t it?” I agreed, but insincerely; I was far too tired to judge if it had been “fine” \nor otherwise. \nMeanwhile the day was ending and the heat becoming less intense. By some vague \nsounds that reached me from the street I knew that the cool  of the evening had set in. \nWe all sat on, waiting. And what we all were waiting for rea lly concerned nobody \nbut me. I looked round the courtroom. It was exactly as it had been on t he first day. I \nmet the eyes of the journalist in gray an d the robot woman. This rem inded me that \nnot once during the whole hearing had I tried to catch Marie’s eye. It wasn’t that I’d \nforgotten her; only I was too preoccupied. I saw her now, seated between Céleste and \nRaymond. She gave m e a little wave of her ha nd, as if to say, “At last!” She was \nsmiling, but I could tell that she was rather  anxious. But m y heart seemed turned to \nstone, and I couldn’t even return her smile. \nThe judges came back to their seats. Someone  read out t o the jury, very rapidly, a \nstring of questions. I caught a word here and there. “Murder of malice aforethought \n... Provocation ... Extenuating circum stances.” The jury went out, and I was taken to  \nthe little room where I had already waited. My  lawyer came to see me; he was very \ntalkative and showed m ore co rdiality and confidence than ever before. He assured \nme that all would go well and I’d get of f with a few years’ im prisonment or \ntransportation. I aske d him what were th e chances of getting the sentence quashed. \nHe said there was no  chance of that. He h ad not raised any point of law, as this was \napt to prejudice the jury. And i t was difficult to get a judgment quashed except on \ntechnical grounds. I saw his point, and agr eed. Looking at the matter dispassionately, \nI shared his view. Otherwise there would be no end to litigation. “In any case,” the  \nlawyer said, “you can appeal i n the ordinary way. But I’m convinced the verdict will \nbe favorable.” \nWe waited for quite a while, a good three qua rters of an hour, I should say. Then a \nbell rang. My lawyer left me, saying: \n“The foreman of the jury will read out the answers. You will be called on after that \nto hear the judgment.” \nSome doors banged.  I heard people hurrying down flights of steps, but  couldn’t \ntell whether they were near by or distan t. Then I heard a voice droning away in the \ncourtroom. \nWhen the bell rang again and I steppe d b ack into the dock, the silence of th e \ncourtroom closed in round m e, and with th e silence came a q ueer sensation when I \n 66\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nnoticed that, for the. first tim e, the young journalist kept his eyes averted. I didn’t \nlook in M arie’s direction. In fact, I had no time to look, as t he presiding judge had \nalready started pronouncing a rigmarole to th e effect that “in the name of the French  \npeople” I was to be decapitated in some public place. \nIt seemed to me then that I could interpret the look on the faces of those present; it \nwas one of almost respectful sympathy. The policemen, too, handled me very gently. \nThe lawyer placed h is hand on m y wrist. I had stopped thinking altogether. I heard  \nthe Judge’s voice asking i f I had anything m ore to say. After thinking for a m oment, \nI answered, “No.” Then the policemen led me out. \n 67"

    "raw_text": "Albert Camus  THE STRANGER \nV \nI HAVE just refuse d, for the third time, to see the prison chaplain. I have nothing to \nsay to him, don’t feel like talking—and shall be seeing him  quite soon enough, \nanyway. The only t hing that i nterests me now is the problem of circumventing t he \nmachine, learning if the inevitable admits a loophole. \nThey have moved me to anot her cell. In this one, lyi ng on my back, I can see the \nsky, and there is nothing else to see. A ll m y time is spent in watching the slowly \nchanging colors of t he sky, as day m oves on to night. I put  m y hands behind my \nhead, gaze up, and wait. \nThis probl em of a loophole obsesses me; I am  always wondering i f t here have \nbeen cas es of condemned prisoners’ es caping from the i mplacable machinery of \njustice at the last m oment, breaking through the police cordon, vanishing in the nick \nof tim e before the guillotine falls. Often and often I blam e m yself for not having \ngiven m ore attention to accounts of publi c executions. One shoul d always take an \ninterest in such matters. There’s never any knowing what one may come to. Like \neveryone else I’d read descriptions of ex ecutions in the papers. But technical books \ndealing with this subject m ust certainly  exist; only I’d never felt sufficiently  \ninterested to look them  up. And i n these books I m ight have found escape stories. \nSurely they’d have t old me that in one  case, anyhow, the wheels had stopped; t hat \nonce, if only once, in that ine xorable march of events, chance or luck had played a \nhappy part. Just once! In a wa y I think that single i nstance would have satisfied me. \nMy em otion would have done the rest. The pa pers often tal k of “a debt owed to \nsociety”—a debt which, according to them, must be paid by the offender. But talk of \nthat sort doesn’t touch the imagination. No, the one thing that counted for me was the \npossibility of m aking a dash for it and def eating their bloodthirsty rite; of a mad  \nstampede to freedom  that would anyhow give me a m oment’s hope, the gam bler’s \nlast throw. Naturally, all that “hope” coul d come to was to be  knocked down at the \ncorner of a street or picked  off by a bullet in my back. But, all things considered, \neven this luxury was forbidden me; I was caught in the rattrap irrevocably. \nTry as I might, I couldn’t st omach this brutal certitude. For really, when one came \nto think of it, there was a disproporti on between the judgment on which it was based \nand the unalterable sequence of events star ting from the moment when that judgment \nwas delivered. The fact that the verdict was r ead out at eight P.M. rather than at five, \nthe fact that it m ight have been quite diff erent, that it was given by m en who change \ntheir underclothes, and was credited to so vague an entity as the “French people” —\nfor that matter, why not to the Chines e or the Ger man people?— all these facts \nseemed to deprive t he court’s decision of  m uch of its gra vity. Yet I could but \nrecognize that, from the moment the verdict was given, its effects became as cogent, \n 68\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nas tangible, as, for example, this wall against which I was lying, pressing my back to \nit. \nWhen such thoughts crossed m y mind, I re membered a story Mother used to tell  \nme about m y father. I never set eyes on hi m. Perhaps the only things I really knew \nabout him were what Mother had told me. One of these was that he’d gone to see a \nmurderer executed. The mere thought of it turne d his stomach. But he’d seen it \nthrough and, on com ing home, was violently sick. At the time, I found m y father’s \nconduct rather disgusting. But now I underst ood; it was so natura l. How had I failed \nto recognize that nothing was m ore important than an execution; that , viewed from \none angle, it’s the only thing that can genuinely interest a man? And I decided that, if \never I got  out of jai l, I’d attend every execution t hat took place. I was unwise, no \ndoubt, even to consider this  possibility. For, the m oment I’d pictured m yself in \nfreedom, standing behind a double rank of po licemen—on the right si de of the line, \nso to speak—the mere thought of being an onlooker who comes to see the show, and \ncan go home and vomit afterward, flooded my mind with a wild, absurd exultation. It \nwas a stupid thing to let my imagination run away with me like that; a moment later I \nhad a shivering fit and had to wrap m yself closely in my blanket. But m y teeth went \non chattering; nothing would stop them. \nStill, obviously, one can’t be  sensible all the tim e. A nother equally ridiculous \nfancy of mine was to frame new laws, altering the penalties. What was wanted, to my \nmind, was to give the crim inal a chance, if only a dog’s chance; say, one chance in a \nthousand. There might be some drug, or combination of drugs, which would kil l the \npatient (I thought of him  as  “the patient”) nine hundred  and ninety times in a \nthousand. That he should know this was, of  course, essential. For after taking m uch \nthought, calmly, I came to the conclusion that what was wrong about the guillotine \nwas that the condem ned m an had no chance at all, absolutely none. In fact, the \npatient’s death had been ordained irrevo cably. It was a foregone conclusion. If by \nsome fluke the knife didn’t do its job, they started again. So it came to this, that—\nagainst the grain, no doubt— the condemned man had to hope the apparatus was in \ngood working order! This, I thought, was a flaw in the system; and, on the face of it, \nmy view was sound enough.  On the othe r hand, I had t o adm it it proved t he \nefficiency of the system . It came to th is; the m an under sentence was obliged to \ncollaborate mentally, it was in his interest that all should go off without a hitch. \nAnother thing I had to recognize was th at, until now, I’d had wrong ideas on the \nsubject. For some reason I’d al ways supposed that one had to go up ste ps and climb \non to a scaffold, to be guillotined. Probably that was because of the 1789 Revolution; \nI mean, what I’d learned about  it at school , and the pictures I had seen. Then one \nmorning I remembered a photograph the newspa pers had featured on the occasion of \nthe execution of a famous criminal. Actually the apparatus stood on the ground; there \nwas nothing very impressing about it, and it was much narrower than I’d imagined. It \n 69\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nstruck me as rather odd that picture had escaped my memory  until now. What had \nstruck me at the tim e was the neat appear ance of the guillotine; its shining surfaces \nand finish reminded me of some laborator y instrument. One always has exaggerated \nideas about what one doesn’t  know. N ow I had to adm it it seem ed a very si mple \nprocess, getting guillotined; the machine is  on the  sam e level as the man, and he \nwalks toward it as he steps forward to meet somebody he knows. In a sense, that, too, \nwas disappointing. The business of clim bing a scaffold, leaving the world below, so \nto speak, gave som ething for a m an’s imagination to get hold of. But, as it was, the \nmachine dominated everything; they kill ed you discreetly, with a hint of sham e and \nmuch efficiency. \nThere were two other things about which I was always thinking: the dawn and m y \nappeal. However, I did m y best to keep my m ind off t hese thoughts.  I lay down, \nlooked up at the sky, and forced m yself to  study it. When the light began to turn \ngreen I knew that night was com ing. Another thing I did to deflect the course of my \nthoughts was to listen to my heart. I couldn’t imagine that this faint throbbing which \nhad been with m e for so long would ever cease. Imagination has never been one of \nmy strong points. Still, I tried to picture a moment when the beating of m y heart no \nlonger echoed in m y head. But, in vain. Th e dawn and m y appeal were still there. \nAnd I ended by believing it wa s a silly thing to try to force one’s thoughts out of \ntheir natural groove. \nThey always came f or one at dawn; that  much I knew. So, really, all m y nights \nwere spen t in waiting for that dawn. I ha ve never liked bei ng taken by surprise. \nWhen something happens to me I want to be ready for it. That’s why I got into t he \nhabit of sl eeping off and on i n the dayt ime and watching through t he night for t he \nfirst hint of daybreak in the dark dom e above. The worst period of the night was that \nvague hour when, I knew, they usually co me; once it was after m idnight I waited , \nlistening intently. Never befo re had m y ears perceived so many noises, such tiny \nsounds. Still, I must say I was lucky in one respect; never during any of those periods \ndid I hear footsteps.  Mother used to sa y that however miserable one is, ther e’s \nalways something to be thankful for. A nd each m orning, when the sky bri ghtened \nand light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her. Because I might just as well have \nheard footsteps, and felt m y heart shattered into bit s. Even though the faintest rustle \nsent me hurrying to the door a nd, pressing an ear to the rough, cold wood, I listened \nso intently that I could hear my breathi ng, quick a nd hoarse like a dog’s panti ng—\neven so there was an end; my heart hadn’t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four \nhours’ respite. \nThen all d ay there was my a ppeal to think about . I made the m ost of this idea, \nstudying my effects so as to squeeze out the maximum of consolation. Thus, I always \nbegan by assuming the worst; my appeal was dismissed. That meant, of course, I was \nto die. Sooner than others, obviously. “But,” I rem inded m yself, “it’s common \n 70\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nknowledge that life isn’t wort h living, anyhow.” And, on a wide view, I could see \nthat it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty  or threescore and \nten—since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will \ngo on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying \nhad to be  got through, inevitably. Still,  somehow this line of thought wasn’t as \nconsoling as it shoul d have been; the idea of all those years of life in hand was a \ngalling reminder! However, I could argue m yself out of it, by picturing what would \nhave been m y feelings when m y term was up, and death had cornered me. Once \nyou’re up against it, the precise manne r of your death has obviousl y small \nimportance. Therefore—but it  was hard not  to lose the thread of the argu ment \nleading up to that “therefore”—I shoul d be  prepared to face the dism issal of my \nappeal. \nAt this stage, but onl y at this stage, I had, so to speak, the right, and accordingly I \ngave myself leave, to consi der the ot her alternative; that my appeal was successful. \nAnd then the troubl e was to calm  down that  sudden rush of joy racing through my \nbody and even bringing tears t o my eyes. But it was up to m e to bring m y nerves to \nheel and steady my mind; for, even in considering this possibility, I had to keep some \norder in my thoughts, so as to make my consolations, as regards the first alternative, \nmore plausible. When I’d succeeded, I had earned a good hour’s peace of m ind; and \nthat, anyhow, was something. \nIt was at one of these mo ments that I refused once again to see the chaplain. I was \nlying down and coul d mark the summer ev ening coming on by a soft golden glow \nspreading across the sky. I ha d just tu rned down m y appeal, and felt m y blood \ncirculating with slow, steady throbs. No, I di dn’t want to see the chaplai n. ... Then I \ndid som ething I hadn’t done for qui te a wh ile; I fell to thinking about Marie. She \nhadn’t wri tten for ages; proba bly, I surm ised, she had grown tired of being the \nmistress o f a man sentenced to death. Or sh e might be ill, or d ead. After all, such \nthings happen. How could I ha ve known about  it, since, apart from  our t wo bodies, \nseparated now, there was no li nk between us, nothing to remind us of each other? \nSupposing she were dead, her m emory w ould m ean nothi ng; I coul dn’t feel an \ninterest in a dead girl. This seemed to me quite norm al; just as I realized people \nwould soon forget me once I was dead. I c ouldn’t even say that this was h ard to \nstomach; really, there’s no idea to which one doesn’t get acclimatized in time. \nMy thoughts had re ached this poi nt when the chaplain walked in, unannounced. I \ncouldn’t help giving a start on seeing him. He  noticed this evidently, as he prom ptly \ntold m e not to be alarm ed. I rem inded him  that usually his visits were at another \nhour, and for a pretty grim  occasion. This, he replied, was just a friendly visit; it had \nno concern with m y appeal, about which he knew nothing. Then he sat down on m y \nbed, asking me to sit  beside him. I refuse d—not because I had anything against him;  \nhe seemed a mild, amiable man. \n 71\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nHe remained quite still at first, his arm s resting on his knees, his eyes fixed on his \nhands. They were slender but sinewy hands , which m ade me think of two nim ble \nlittle animals. Then he gently rubbed the m together. He stayed so long in the sa me \nposition that for a while I almost forgot he was there. \nAll of a sudden he jerked his head up and looked me in the eyes. \n“Why,” he asked, “don’t you let me come to see you?” \nI explained that I didn’t believe in God. \n“Are you really so sure of that?” \nI said I saw no point  in troubling my head about the matter; wh ether I believed or \ndidn’t was, to my mind, a question of so little importance. \nHe then leaned back  against the wall, l aying his hands flat on his t highs. Almost \nwithout seeming to address m e, he remarked that he’d often noticed one fancies one \nis quite sure about something, when in point  of fact one isn’t . When I said nothing, \nhe looked at me again, and asked: \n“Don’t you agree?” \nI said that  seemed quite possi ble. But, though I m ightn’t be so sure about what \ninterested me, I was absolute ly sure about what didn’t in terest me. And the question \nhe had raised didn’t interest me at all. \nHe looked away and, without altering hi s posture, asked if it was because I felt \nutterly desperate that I spoke like this. I e xplained that it wasn’t despair I felt, but \nfear—which was natural enough. \n“In that case,” he said firm ly, “God can help you. All the men I’ve seen in your \nposition turned to Him in their time of trouble.” \nObviously, I replied, they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it. I, however, \ndidn’t want to be helped, a nd I hadn’t  time to work up interest for something that \ndidn’t interest me. \nHe fluttered his hands fretfully; then, sitting up, sm oothed out his cassock. When  \nthis was done he began talk ing again, addressing me as  “m y friend.” It wasn’t \nbecause I’d been condemned to death, he said, that he spoke to me in this way. In his \nopinion every man on the earth was under sentence of death. \nThere, I i nterrupted him; that wasn’t th e same thing, I pointed out, and, what’s \nmore, could be no consolation. \nHe nodded. “Maybe. Still, if you don’t die soon, you’ll die one day. And then the \nsame question will arise. How will you face that terrible, final hour?” \nI replied that I’d face it exactly as I was facing it now. \nThereat he stood up, and looked me straight in the eyes. It was a trick I knew well. \nI used to amuse myself trying it on Emmanuel and Céleste, and ni ne times out of ten \nthey’d look away unco mfortably. I could s ee the chaplain was an old hand at it, as  \nhis gaze never faltered. And his voice was quite steady when he said: “Have you no \n 72\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nhope at all? Do you really think that when you die you die outright, and nothi ng \nremains?” \nI said: “Yes.” \nHe dropped his eyes and sat down again. He was truly sorry fo r me, he said. It \nmust make life unbearable for a man, to think as I did. \nThe priest was beginning to bore m e, and,  resting a shoulder on the wall, just \nbeneath the little skylight, I looked away. Though I didn’t trouble much to follow \nwhat he said, I gathered he was questi oning m e again. Presently his t one became \nagitated, urgent, and, as I reali zed that he was genuinely dist ressed, I began to pay \nmore attention. \nHe said he felt convinced my appeal would succeed, but I was saddled with a load \nof guilt, of which I m ust get rid. In his view man’s justice was a vain thing; only \nGod’s just ice mattered. I point ed out tha t the form er had condem ned me. Yes, he \nagreed, but it hadn’t absolved me fro m my sin. I told him  that I wasn’t  conscious of \nany “sin”; all I knew was that I’d been gu ilty of a crim inal o ffense. Well, I was \npaying the penalty of that offe nse, and no one had the right  to expect an ything more \nof me. \nJust then he got up again, and it st ruck me that if he wanted  to m ove in this tiny \ncell, almost the only choice lay between  standing up and si tting down. I was staring \nat the floor. He took a single step toward me, and halted, as if he didn’t dare to come \nnearer. Then he looked up through the bars at the sky. \n“You’re mistaken, my son,” he said gravel y. “There’s more that might be required \nof you. And perhaps it will be required of you.” \n“What do you mean?” \n“You might be asked to see ...” \n“To see what?” \nSlowly the priest gazed round my cell, and I was struck by the sadness of his voice \nwhen he replied: \n“These stone walls, I know it only too well,  are steeped in human suffering. I’ve \nnever been able to look at them  without  a shudder. And ye t—believe m e, I am \nspeaking from  the depths of m y heart—I know that even the wr etchedest amo ngst \nyou have sometim es seen, taking form  against that grayness, a divine face. It’s that \nface you are asked to see.” \nThis roused m e a little. I informed him  th at I’d been staring at those walls for \nmonths; there was nobody, nothing in the world, I knew better than I knew them. \nAnd once upon a time, perhaps, I used to try to see a face. But it was a sun-gold face, \nlit up with desire—Marie’s face. I had no lu ck; I’d never seen it, and now I’d given  \nup tryi ng. Indeed, I’d never seen anythi ng “taking form,” as  he called  it, ag ainst \nthose gray walls. \n 73\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nThe chaplain gazed at  me wit h a sort of sadness. I now had my back t o the wall \nand light  was flowing over m y forehead. He  mut tered some words I didn’t catch ; \nthen abruptly asked if he might kiss me. I said, “No.” Then he turned, came up to the \nwall, and slowly drew his hand along it. \n“Do you really love these earthly things so very much?” he asked in a low voice. \nI made no reply. \nFor quite a while h e kept his eyes av erted. His presence was getting m ore and \nmore irksome, and I was on the point of te lling him to go, and leave me in peace,  \nwhen all of a sudden he swung round on me, and burst out passionately: \n“No! No! I refuse to believe it. I’m  sure you’ve often wi shed there was an \nafterlife.” \nOf course I had, I told him . Everybody ha s that wish at times. But that had no \nmore importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or  to have a better-\nshaped mouth. It was in the same order of things. I was going on in t he same vein, \nwhen he cut in with a question. How did I picture the life after the grave? \nI fairly ba wled out at him : “A life in which I can remember this life on earth. \nThat’s all I want of it.” And i n the same  breath I told him  I’d had enough of his \ncompany. \nBut, apparently, he had m ore to say on the subject of God. I went close up to him \nand made a last attem pt to explain that I’d very litt le time left, and I wasn’t going to \nwaste it on God. \nThen he tried to change the subject by asking me why I hadn’t once addressed him \nas “Father,” seeing that he was a priest. That irritated me still more, and I told him he \nwasn’t my father; quite the contrary, he was on the others’ side. \n“No, no, m y son,” he said, layi ng his hand on my shoulder. “I’m  on your side, \nthough you don’t re alize it—because your h eart is hardened. But I shall pray for \nyou.” \nThen, I don’t know how it was, but someth ing seemed to break inside m e, and I \nstarted yelling at the top of m y voice. I hurled insul ts at him, I told him  not to waste \nhis rotten prayers on me; it was better to burn than to disappear. I’d taken him by the \nneckband of his cassock, and, in a sort of ecstasy of joy and rage, I poured out on \nhim all the thoughts that had been simmering in my brain. He seemed so cocksure, \nyou see. And yet none of hi s certainties was worth one strand of a wom an’s hair. \nLiving as he did, like a corpse, he couldn’t ev en be sure of bei ng alive. It might look \nas if my hands were empty. Actually, I was sure of myself, sure about everything, far \nsurer than he; sure of m y present life a nd of the death that was com ing. That, no \ndoubt, was all I had; but at least that ce rtainty was som ething I could get m y teeth \ninto—just as it had got its teeth into m e. I’d been right, I was still right, I was always \nright. I’d passed m y life in a certain way, and I might have passed it in a different \nway, if I’d felt like it . I’d acted thus, and I hadn’t  acted othe rwise; I hadn’t done x, \n 74\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nwhereas I had done y or z. And what did that mean? Th at, all the time, I’d been \nwaiting for this present m oment, for that dawn, tomorrow’s or anot her day’s, which \nwas to justify m e. Nothing, nothing had the least im portance and I knew quite well \nwhy. He, too, knew why. Fro m the dark horizon of m y future a sort of slow, \npersistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all m y life long, from  the years that \nwere to come. And on its way that breeze ha d leveled out all  the ideas that people \ntried to foist on m e in the equally unre al years I then was living through. What \ndifference could they make to  m e, the deaths of others, or a m other’s love, or hi s \nGod; or the way a man decide s to live, the fate he thinks he chooses, since one and \nthe sam e fate was bound to “choose” not on ly me but thousands of m illions of \nprivileged people who, like hi m, called them selves m y brothers. Sure ly, surely he \nmust see that? Every m an alive was privileg ed; there was only one class of men, th e \nprivileged class. All alike would be condem ned to die one day; his t urn, too, would \ncome like the others’. And what difference could it make if, after being charged with \nmurder, he were executed because he didn’t w eep at his mother’s funeral, since it all \ncame to the same thing in the end? Th e same thing for Sa lamano’s wife and for \nSalamano’s dog. That little robot woman was as “guilty” as the girl from Paris who \nhad married Masson, or as Marie, who wanted me to marry  her. What did it matter if \nRaymond was as m uch my pal as Céleste, w ho was a far wort hier man? What did i t \nmatter if at this very m oment Marie was kissing a new boy friend? As a condemned \nman him self, couldn’t he gra sp what I me ant by that dark wind blow ing from  my \nfuture? ... \nI had been shouti ng so m uch that I’d lost  m y breath, and just  then the jailers \nrushed in and started trying to release th e chaplain from my grip . One of them mad e \nas if to strike me. The chaplain quietened them down, then gazed at me for a moment \nwithout speaking. I could see tears in his eyes. Then he turned and left the cell. \nOnce he’d gone, I felt calm ag ain. But all this exciteme nt had exhausted me and I \ndropped heavily on to my sleeping plank. I must have had a l ongish sleep, for, when \nI woke, the stars were shining down on m y face. Sounds of th e count ryside came \nfaintly in,  and the cool night air, veined  with sm ells’ of earth and salt, fanned my \ncheeks. The m arvelous peace of the sleepbound summer night floode d through me \nlike a tide. Then, just on the edge of daybr eak, I heard a steamer’s siren. People were \nstarting on a voyage to a world which had ce ased to concern me forever. Alm ost for \nthe first time in many m onths I thought of m y mother. And now, it seemed to m e, I \nunderstood why at her life’s end she had ta ken on a “fiancé”; why she’d played at \nmaking a fresh start. There, to o, in that Home where lives were flick ering out, the \ndusk came as a m ournful sol ace. With deat h so near, Mother m ust have felt like \nsomeone on the brink of freedom, ready to star t life all over again. No one, no one in \nthe world had any right to weep for her. A nd I, too, felt ready to start life all over \nagain. It was as if that great rush of a nger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, \n 75\n\f\nAlbert Camus  THE STRANGER \nand, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with  its signs and stars, for the first tim e, the \nfirst, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so lik e \nmyself, indeed, so brotherly, made me r ealize that I’d been happy, and that I was \nhappy still. For all to be acco mplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to \nhope was that on the day of m y execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators \nand that they should greet me with howls of execration. \n \n \nTHE END. \n 76"
