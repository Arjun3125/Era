Despite \nhis relatively undistinguished background and ever-recurrent ill \nhealth, he rose rapidly to prominence at Rome, pursuing the double \ncareer in the courts and political life for which he had been trained. He \nbegan also quickly to acquire celebrity as an author of tragedies and of \npolished essays, moral, literary and scientific. Sentenced to death by \nsuccessive emperors (Caligula in A.D. 37 and Claudius in A.D. 41 ), he \nspent eight years in exile on the island of Corsica, allegedly for an \naffair with Caligula's sister. Recalled in A.D. 49, he was made praetor, \nand was appointed tutor to the boy who was to become, in A.D. 54, \nthe emperor Nero. On Nero's succession Seneca acted for some eight \nyears as an unofficial chief minister. The early part of this reign was \nremembered as a period of sound imperial government, for which, \naccording to our sources, the main credit must be given to Seneca. \nHis control over an increasingly cruel emperor declined as enemies \nturned Nero against him with representations that his popularity \nmade him a danger, or with accusations of immorality or excessive \nwealth ill assorting with the noble Stoic principles he professed. \nRetiring from public life he devoted his last three years to philosophy \nand writing, particularly the Letters from a Stoic. In A.D. 65, following \nthe discovery of a plot against the emperor, which might have \nresulted in Seneca's elevation to the throne, he and many others were \ncompelled by Nero to commit suicide.

This was \nfollowed after Zambia's independence by a year as a Magistrate, \ntrying witch-doctors, hearing appeals from tribal courts over a vast \narea and revising this translation at intervals of leisure in the bush.

    "raw_text": "INTRODUCTION \nSENECA 's LIPB \nLuc iUS ANNAEUS SENECA was born at Cordoba, then the \nleading town in Roman Spain, at about the same time as \nChrist.1 His father, Marcus Annaeus Seneca, was an imperial \nprocurator2 who became an authority on rhetoric, the art of \npublic speaking and debate. 3 He was the father not only of \nour Seneca, who speaks of his 'old-fashioned strictness',4 \nbut also of Novatus, later known as Gallio, the governor of \nAchaea who declined to exercise jurisdiction over St Paul \n(Acts XVlll, 11-17), and of Mela, less ambitious than his \nbrothers but an able financier (and father of the brilliant young \npoet Lucan). \nSeneca suffered severely from ill health, particularly asthma, \nthroughout his life; he tells us that at one time the only thing \nwhich held him back from committing suicide was the \nthought of his father's inability to bear the loss. 5 He spent a \nperiod of his early life in Egypt (where the husband of a \ndevoted aunt named Marcia was the viceroy of the emperor \nTiberius from A.D. 16 to 31), there acquiring experience in \nmatters �f administration and finance. He also studied the \ngeography and ethnology of Egypt and India6 and developed a \nlasting interest in natural science, speculative rather than \nempirical (although Pliny speaks of him as an authority on \ngeology, marine life and meteorology, and others have \nadmired his remarks on, for example, evolution or the ex­\nplanation of rings round the sun). His interest was drawn at \nan early age to Pythagorean mysticism and various cults of \neastern origin then gaining adherents in Rome, before his \n£in.a1 acceptance, in large part, of the Stoic philosophy. \n7\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nMter training for the bar he took successfully to public \nlife, becoming quaestor in spite of the handicaps of his \nhealth, his foreign background and comparative lack of \nfamily or other connexions. When Caligula succeeded Tiberius \nin A.D. 37, Seneca had become a leading speaker in the \nSenate, and so aroused the jealousy 7 of the new emperor that \naccording to Dio Cassius he ordered his execution and was \nonly induced to let him off by a woman close to the imperial \nthrone who said that Seneca was 'suffering from advanced \ntuberculosis and it would not be long before he died'. 8 This \nincident apparently resulted in his temporary retirement from \npolitical affairs. \nIn A.D. 41, in the first year of the reign of Caligula's \nsuccessor, Claudius, Seneca again came under sentence of \ndeath - commuted to banishment - for reasons which we do \nnot know. The pretext was adultery with Julia Livilla, the \nlate emperor's sister; the more likely explanation9 is that the \nnew ruler's consort, the notorious Messalina, considered him \ndangerous. His exile on· the island of Corsica does not seem \nto have been endured as stoically as it might have been. The \nencouraging spirit of an essay of consolation sent to his dearly \nloved mother Helvia is entirely absent in another addressed \nto Polybius, an ex-slave who had become a trusted servant of \nthe emperor, which contains some abject flattery and was \nprobably never meant to be published. He had by now suffered \nthe loss not only of his father but of a son, and his first wife \ndied while he was away. 1he only solace for him in these \neight long years of loneliness and near despair was the \nreception given to the poems, tragedies and essays to friends \nwhich he continued composing during his banishment. \nHis fortunes turned dramatically in A. o. 4 9· Messalina had \nbeen executed and the emperor's new wife, Agrippina, had \nSeneca recalled to Rome, appointed to the high office of \npraetor and made tutor to her twelve-year-old son Lucius \n8\n\f\nIN TRO DUCTION \nDomitius Ahenobarbus (the boy who was shortly to become \nthe emperor Nero). Agrippina's motives, according to \nTacitus, apart from the instruction of her son, were a confi­\ndence that because of his 'li terary fa me' the move would \ngain them popularity, and a belief that he would prove a \nreliable ally and a useful adviser to herself and Nero in their \nplans fo r future power.10 \nThere is no evidence that Seneca was connected with the \npoisoning of Claudius in A. D. 54· But he wrote the speeches \nwhich the seventeen-year-old Nero delivered after his \naccession, and was probably the author of a witty, if to us a \nlittle tasteless, attack on the dead ruler 's memory (the \nApocolocyntosis or 'Pumpkinifi.cation ', an imaginary tale of \nthe rebuffs received by the recently deceased emperor when \nhe presents himself at the portals of Heaven and his applica­\ntion fo r admission is debated by the Gods). Nero did make a \nfo rmal speech in honour of his predecessor, which was said \nto display 'a great deal of polish ' and to be a good example of \nSeneca's 'attractive style, well tuned to the ears of his time'.U \nThe new regime opened well and 'Nero's first five years' \nwere later spoken of as a period of unequalled good govern­\nment, the emperor Trajan even calling them the finest period \nin the history of imperial Rome.U For this Rome was in­\ndebted to Seneca and an army officer named Burrus. These \ntwo, 'the most influential as well as the most enlightened of \nthe men who surrounded Nero ' (Dio),13 'whose wide \nexperience was common knowledg e' (Tacitus),14 prevented \nthe hot-headed young man from carrying out a lot of murders \non his accession and aimed at channell ing some of his energies \ninto 'permissible pleasu res '.15 Only briefly alarmed by the \npoisoning of Britannicus and acting throughout in complete \nharmony they succeeded in keeping public business out of \nAgrippina's hands and in their own. Tacitus ascribes the \nsecret of the influence of Seneca to 'his tuition of Nero in \n9\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \npublic spealcing, and his engaging manners and high princi­\nples', that of Burrus to 'his military responsibilities and \nausterity of character'.16 \nThe two of them 'took over total power, and exercised it, \nto the utmost of their ability, in the best and justest way \nconceivable, thus each alike arousing all men's approval' \n(Dio).\" While Nero amused himself they set about the \nproblems of government; we notice - to give instances of \ntheir activity - legal and financial reforms including the \nreduction of indirect taxation and steps to prevent peculation \nand extortion by provincial governors, and the prosecution of \na successful war in Armenia to settle the empire's eastern \nfrontier. Seneca's geographical interests appear in the dis­\npatch of an expedition 'to investigate the source of the \nNile'. Yet another ofhis interests was shorthand, the Roman \nsystem of which he is said to have completely revised. \nNeither he nor Burrus appears to have held any standing \nlegal or constitutional office that could be said to give them \nthe authority they wielded during these years. Seneca, 'the \nreal master of the world ', 18 seems simply to have been the \nmoving force behind the throne. It is probably safe to say \nthat Nero (unlike Aristotle's celebrated pupil at a similar age, \nAlexander the Great) was still under the influence of a \nteacher of undoubted personal charm, and was quite content \nto leave to him the direction of affairs in which he had little \nreal interest. Once the young emperor began to listen to \nother advisers and increasingly to indulge his more violent \nand vindictive impulses this happy situation was doomed. \nIn A.D. 58 Seneca was being attacked by people like \nPublius Suill ius Rufus.19 Accusations seem to have ranged in \ngravity from sleeping with the emperor's mother (obviously \nthe man had failed to learn his lesson from his 'thoroughly \ndeserved' banishment for 'seducing imperial princesses') and \nthe introduction of the emperor to paederasty, to the use-\nIO\n\f\nIN TROD UC TION \nlessness of his studies and the affectedness of his oratorical \nstyle. But the campaign against him generally cehtred on \nthe apparent contrast - it has been a stock criticism of Seneca \nright down the centuries - between his philosophical teach­\nings and his practice. Instances of this hypocrisy, according to \nSuillius, were the philosopher's denunciations of tyranny, \nwhich did not stop him from being tutor to a tyrant; of \nflattery, ill according with the attitude he had adopted, \nespecially from exile, towards ex-slaves who headed depart­\nments in Claudius' administration; of extravagance, in spite \nof (allegedly) giving banquets served at five hundred identical \ntables of citrus wood with ivory legs; and, above all, of \nwealth. 'What kind of wisdom,' asked Suillius, 'what philo­\nsophical teachings, had led him to acquire three hundred \nmillion sesterces within the space of four years in royal \nfavour? The childless and their legacies had been, if he might \nso put it, enticed into Seneca's net, whilst all Italy and the \nprovinces were being sucked dry by his practice of lending \nmoney at unlimited rates of interest.' \nSeneca was indeed already cdebrated for his riches. Juvenal \nill.entions 'the great Gardens of the immensely wealthy \nSeneca'.20 Agrippina, says Dio, had acquired for him 'untold \nwealth from all sources'.21 The agricultural writer Columella \nmentions the remarkable productivity of his wine growing \nestates, the best in Italy, at Mentana.12 The reply, if any, \nwhich Seneca gave to his attackers' criticisms of his wealth, \nwas probably that contained in an essay On the Happy Life \nsent to his brother Gallic. What counts, he says, is one's \nattitude to wealth, which is the wise man's servant and the \nfool's master; he, like any good Stoic, could lose all he had \nat any moment without being a whit less happy. This is the \ncore of a long reply to the charge, which he states with \ncomplete frankness, that 'philosophers do not practise what \nthey preach'. His everyday life did not lend countenance to \nII\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nsuch attacks (we have at least his own accow1ts23 of his plain \ndiet and life-long teetotalism, his hard bed, cold baths and \ndaily runs); and on this occasion he came to no harm from \nhis enemies. \nIn A. D. 59 Nero had his mother put to death, the murder \nbeing carried out in cold blood after the calamitous failure \nof an attempt to stage an accident at sea. There is reason to \nbelieve that Seneca and Burrus had no knowledge of or part \nin the planning of this crime, but as the facts became known \ndid their best to lessen its impact on public opinion. Seneca \ncertainly drafted the letter sent to the Senate 'explaining' how \nher death was the result of the exposure of a dangerous plot \nof hers against the emperor's life. Dio would have us believe \nthat Seneca averted a general massacre by saying to Nero, \n'However many people you slaughter you cannot kill your \nsuccessor.' 24 \nTacitus25 tells us that the death ('probably murder') of \nBurrus in A.D. 62 'broke Seneca's power'. Enemies gained \nthe ear of Nero with tales of Seneca's popularity and growing \nwealth; the ft.rst was represented as being dangerous to the \nthrone, the second as overshadowing the possessions of the \nemperor himself (whose abilities as an artist and a speaker \nwere also, it was said, being disparaged by his old instructor). \nNero, they said, was now grown up and it was time for him to \n'shak� off his tutor'. Seneca, warned of this by friends, \nrealized his danger and decided to ask the emperor for \npermission to retire from public life. The request was granted \nand the parting was made amicable. \nFor the last three years of his life, Seneca devoted himself to \nphilosophy and writing, including the Epistulae Morales to \nLucilius Junior, a native of Pompeii, a hard-working higher \ncivil servant (procurator in Sicily at the time) who appears to \nhave dabbled in literature and philosophy. Spending his \ntime moving around southern Italy with Paulina, his second \n12\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nwife, Seneca now rarely visited Rome, and even, to disarm \nsuspicion or for greater safety, gave (says Dio) his entire \nfortune to the emperor. Tacitus mentions a story of an \nattempt on his life by poisoning, averted either because a \nslave gave the plot away or because the philosopher was, in \nfear of jwt such an attack, living on 'an extremely simple \ndiet of fruits growing wild and running water'. 26 \nThen in A. D. 65 came the disastrous conspiracy against the \nemperor by Piso and others, quite possibly including Seneca. \nThere was a report of a sub-conspiracy to kill Piso as well and \nmake Seneca emperor - 'being a man who see med to be \nmarked out for supreme power by the good qualities for \nwhich he was so famow'.27 Many people lost their lives on \nthe discovery of the plot. Seneca, like many others, was \nasked to commit suicide, the then prevailing· method of \nimperial execution. Tacitus' description of his death is not \nquickly forgotten. 28 His brothers and Lucan followed him, \nall by their own hands, in the course of Nero's frenzied purge \nof enemies real and imagined. \nAccording to some, a true Stoic, like Cato under the \nRepublic, would have stayed on in political life to the bitter \nend. But after the loss of all his influence over Nero, the \nSpaniard could hardly have hoped to be of useful service any \nlonger to the Roman world, and (in an age in which many \nlived in re current dread of a capriciow emperor's message \ndemanding, obliquely or otherwise, the recipient's suicide) \nthe alternative to his retirement was undoubtedly death. \nCertain other Stoics, indeed, stood up to emperors and were \nrewarded for their opposition to misrule with martyrdom. \nSeneca chose to spend what time was left to him in philosophy, \nand the reader may be left to decide, in fairness not forgetting \nhis chronic ill health, whether his 'lack of moral courage \noutside the study' in this or earlier events detracts from his \nachievements. Surprisingly, perhaps, the satirist of the century, \n13"

    "raw_text": "IN TROD UCTION \nJuvenal, does not pick on the diff erence between this public \nfigure's conduct and his philosophical professions, of which a \nvariety of later writers have made play.29 'Sir, are you so \ngrossly ignorant of human nature,' asked Dr Johnson, 'as \nnot to know that a man may be very sincere in good principles \nwithout having good practice?' Seneca, all the same, may \nwell be history's most notable example of a man who failed \nto live up to his principles. \nThis does not prevent him from being the outstanding \nfigure of his age. 'Seneca, in those days unsurpassed both in \n· the field of letters and in power (power which afterwards \ngrew too great and recoiled upon his own head), was the \nlast man to be impressed by things which did not count,' \nsaid his contemporary Pliny.30 Money, power or achieve­\nments in public life or letters are - despite the interest of the \nlittle we know of his career - not the things with which \nSeneca would want to be connected by people coming across \nhis name today. That he did not expect to be forgotten we \nknow (in one letter he actually promises Lucilius immortality \nthrough having corresponded with him); but what he would \nhave liked to be remembered for would have been the value \nof the ideas which, so he tells Lucilius in his eighth letter, he \nwas committing to writing in the hope that they might be 'of \nuse to later generations'. \nSEN ECA AND PHILOS OPHY \nStoicism, for centuries the most influential philosophy in the \nGraeco-Roman world, had a long history before Seneca. \nFounded by Zeno (hom of Phoenician descent in Cyprus \nc. 336/s B.c.) who had taught or lectured in a well-known \nstoa (a colonnade or porch)- hence the name- in Athens, it \nhad been developed and modified by a succession of thinkers \nwhose opinions on various logical, ethical or cosmological \n14\n\f\nINT-RODUCTION \nquestions showed some . fair divergencies. & a moral creed, \nhowever, it was based throughout on the following frame­\nwork of belie£ \nThe Stoics saw the world as a single great community in \nwhich all men are brothers, ruled by a supreme providence \nwhich could be spoken of, almost according to choice or \ncontext, under a variety of names or descriptions including \nthe divine reason, creative reason, nature, the spirit or purpose \nof the universe, destiny, a personal god, even (by way of \nconcession to traditional religion) 'the gods'. It is man's duty \nto live in conformity with the divine will, and this means, \nfirstly, bringing his life into line with 'nature's laws', and \nsecondly, resigning himself completdy and uncomplainingly \nto whatever fate may send him. Only by living thus, and not \nsetting too high a value on things which can at any moment \nbe taken away from him, can he discover that true, unshake­\nable peace and contentment to which ambition, luxury and \nabove all avarice are among the greatest obstacles. \nLiving 'in accorda nce with nature ' means not only question­\ning convention and training ourselves to do without all \nexcept the necessities (plain food, water, basic clothing and \nshelter) but developing the inborn gift of reason which marks \nus off as diff erent from the animal world. We are meant to \nset free or perfect this rational element, this particle of the \nuniversal reason, the 'divine spark' in our human make-up, so \nthat it may campaign against and conquer pain, grief, super­\nstition and the fear of death. It will show us that 'there's \nnothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so', \ndiscipline the pleasures and the passions, and generally subordi­\nnate the body and emotions to the mind and soul. \nIn this way we shall arrive at the true end of man, happiness, \nthrough having attained the one and only good thing in \nlife, the ideal or goal called arete in Greek and in Latin virtus -\nfor which the English word 'virtue' is so unsatisfactory a \nIS\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \ntranslation. This, the summum bonum or 'supreme ideal', is \nusually summari zed in ancient philosophy as a combination of \nfour qualities: wisdom (or moral insight), courage, self­\ncontrol and justice (or upright dealing). lt enables a man to be \n'self-sufficient', immune to suffering, superior to the wounds \nand upsets of life (often personalized as Fortuna,-the goddess \nof fortune). Even a slave thus armed can be called 'free', or \nindeed tided 'a king' since even a king cannot touch him. \nAnother example of these 'paradoxes' for which the Stoics \nwere celebrated is one directed at the vanity of worldly \npossessions: 'the shortest route to wealth is the contempt of \nwealth.'31 \nThis ethic, together with its backing in a system of physics \nand logic, had first been given shape in the minds of thinkers \nwho, although Greek.-speak.iri.g, were for the most part not of \nEuropean descent, coming from places in Asia Minor or the \nLevant like Tarsus, Cyprus, and Babylon. This does not seem \nto have reduced the appeal it made to educated Romans \nwhen, around the middle of the second century B.C., it first \ncame to their notice. The duties it inculcated - courage and \nendurance, self-control and self-reliance, upright conduct and \njust dealing, simple and unluxurious habits, rationality, \nobedience to the state - were self-evident to many Romans, \ncorresponding quite closely to the traditional idea of virtus. \nThe development of the jus naturae by the Roman jurists \nand Posidonius' identification of the Stoic world community \nor cosmopolis with the Roman Empire made its acceptance \neven easier. At a later date the Stoic view of the ruler (this \nterm including governors, magistrates and administrative \nofficials)32 as a man whose actions could he criticized, and \neven as a minister or servant, was to be disliked by emperors, \nsome of whom replied by expelling 'the philosophers .'. But \nStoics were usually far from hostile to monarchy as such, \nhowever openly they declared that rank counted for nothing \n16\n\f\nINTROD UCTI ON \nagainst the duty of all men, whatever their station, te play \ntheir part in life well. \nDespite its wide acceptance in educated circles, early \nStoicism had a forbidding aspect which went far to explain \nits failure to influence the masses. There was something un­\nreal or fictional about the sapiens, the wise man or philosopher. \nThis ideal figure see med, from the way the Stoic lecturers \ntalked, to have somehow become perfect in some sudden \ntransformation long ago; gradual self-improvement was \nhardly discussed. The target it set seem ed too high for ordinary \nmen. It stifled and repr essed ordinary human emotions in \nstriving after apatheia, immunity to feeling; Cato, the great \nStoic saint, is reported to have expr essed regret at having \nkissed his wife in a moment of danger. It held that in certain \ncircumstances a man's self-respect might invite; as an act of \nsupreme nobility, his suicide. In punuing the ideal of \nautarkeia, self-sufficiency, it seemed to make the perfect man \na person detached and aloof from his fellows, superior to the \nworld he lived in. Altogether the impression it conveyed, for \nall its idealism and sincerity, could be cold, dogmatic and \nunrealistic. Seneca's contribution to ancient philosophy lay in \nthe humanization of this creed, continuing a process begun \nlong before in Rhodes and Rome by Panaetius and Posidonius. \nAlthough Seneca wrote for a relatively narrow circle of \neducated persons (usually addressing his compositions to a \nparticular friend or relative as if he were that person's special \nspiritual adviser) his letters and essa ys show a Stoicism more \nclosely reconciled with the facts and frailty of human nature. \nThe ideal of apatheia is much modified. Self- suffi cient though \nhe is, the sapiens can now have friends and can grieve, within \nlimits, at the loss of one. It has become his duty to be kind \nand forgiving towards others, indeed to 'live for the other \nperson'.33 In his way ofliving he should avoid being ostenta­\ntiously diff erent from those he tries to win from moral \n17\n\f\nIN TRODUCT ION \nignorance. He has to battle like the rest against his failings. \nin a long and painful progress towards perfection in which all \ncan do with help from above or the inspiration of others' \nexample. Seneca himself, we observe, occasionally makes \nimmodest statements concerning his own progress, but is \ncapable of humility, as in one description of himself as 'a \nlong way from being a tolerable, let alone a perfect hwnan \nbeing'.34 \nIn statements of man's kinship with a beneficent, even loving \ngod and of a belief in conscience as the divinely inspired \n'inner light of the spirit', his attitudes are religious beyond \nanything in Roman state religion, in his day little more than \na withered survival of formal worship paid to a host of \nancient gods and goddesses. Christian writers have not been \nslow to recognize the remarkably close parallels between \nisolated sentences in Seneca's writings and verses of the \nBible.35 On the other hand the word 'God' or 'the gods' \nwas used by the philosophers more as a tirn�honoured and \nconvenient expression than as standing for any indispensable \nor even surely identifiable component of the Stoic system. \nAnd the tendency of Stoicism was always to exalt man's \nimportance in the universe rather than to abase him before a \nhigher authority. The hope of immortality was occasionally \nheld out but Seneca does not play on it. To him as to most \nStoics virtue was to be looked on as its own reward and vice \nas its own punishment. The religious hunger of the masses \nof his day was to be met not by philosophy but by the cults \noflsis and Mithras and Christianity. \nFor the ancient world, then, apart from reviving philosophy \nin Latin literature, he 'spiritualized and humanized'36 \nStoicism. What of Seneca and modem philosophy? The \nlatter, at least in the universities of the English-speaking \nworld, has for some time been set on a course which he would \ncertainly have condemned; he would not have understood \n18\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nthe attention it pays to ordinary language, and some of his \nletters (for example letter XL VIll) make it clear that it would \nhave come in for a share of his impatience with philosophers \n(not excluding Stoics) who in his eyes degraded philosophy \nby wasting their time on verbal puzzles or logical hair­\nsplitting. But more than this, he would have denounced the \nopinion to which most philosophers, tacitly or otherwise, \nhave come round in the last half-century, that it is no part of \nthe bwiness of philosophy to turn people into better persons, \nas tantamount to desertion or lese-majeste. His tremendow \nfaith in philosophy as a mistress was grounded on a belief \nthat her end was the practical one of curing souls, of bringing \npeace and order to the feverish minds of men pursuing the \nwrong aims in life. 'What we say shquld be of we, not jwt \nentertaining.'37 Even speculation on the nature or meaning \nof the universe was of secondary importance, something \nwhich the philosopher might or might not, as he chose, take \nup in leisure moments. A philosopher's words should (as a \nQuaker might put it) 'speak to our condition '. Fielding's \nobservation that few people in the position of being 'over­\nloaded with prosperity or adversity ' could be too wise or \ntoo foolish not to gain from reading Seneca might have \ngratified him not merely as an indication that his writings \nwere proving 'of use' to later generations, but also as showing \nthat a philosopher could still be regarded as someone to be \nturned to for advice or consolation. To Seneca, as Letter XC \nand other letters plainly show, the philosopher and the wise \nman were the same person. \nWhether or not his letters may still be turned to for their \npointers to the contented life, they cannot be read without \nnoticing how far in advance of their time are many 'of his \nideas - on the shows in the arena, for example, or the treat­\nment of slaves.

These elements of Stoicism \nmade their not so small or indirect contribution to the French \nand American revolutions. \nSENECA AND LITERATURE \nHis letters and other writings \n'Seneca,' Quintilian tells us, 'turned his hand to practically \neverything which can be made the subject of study - speeches, \npoems, letters, dialogues all surviving.' Much of this is lost, \nincluding all his speeches (political and forensic), a biography of \nhis father, and essays or treatises on marriage, superstition \nand a variety of other subjects, mainly scientific. \nThe works remaining to us (apart fi:om brief poems or \nepigrams whose attribution to Seneca is sometimes doubtful) \nare of two main kinds. There are, first, the philosophical \nletters and es5ays, including treatises with such titles as The \nHappy Life, The Shortness of Life, Providence, Anger, Clemency, \nProblems in Natural Science and literary consolationes to persons \nin bereavement.· And secondly there are the tragedies, prob­\nably never staged and intended only for reading or recitation \namong a relatively small circle. 38 \nThe one hwtdred and twenty four letters to Lucilius \ncomprise something entirely new in literature. For in these, \nwhich were his most conspicuous and immediate literary \nsuccess, Seneca if anyone is the fowtder of the Essay. As \nFrancis Bacon put it to Prince Henry in the dedication of his \n20\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nown Essays: 'The word is late, but the thing is auncient. For \nSenecaes Epistles to Lucilius, yf one marke them well, are \nbut Essaies, that is, dispersed Meditacions, thoughe conveyed \nin the forme of Epistles.' The Epistulae Morales are essays in \ndisguise. It has been said39 that they were real letters edited \nfor publication. It seems most likely that they were intended \nfrom the first for publication, possibly preceded by an interval \nof private circulation. No replies have come down to us. \nThe atmosphere varies from that of lively, not to say \ncolloquial, conversation to that of the serious treatise; it. is \noccasionally raised to higher levels, 40 but generally remains \ninformal. The 'teaching' is generously eclectic; the first \nthirty letters each contain some quotation from or reference \nto writings of the main rival philosophical school, the \nEpicureans. The introduction of imaginary queries or objec­\ntions (often scathing in tone) from the correspondent or \nanother interjector and the frequent and urgent exhortation \nof the listener to self-improvement suggest the atmosphere of \nthe diatribe, while confidences about the writer's own charac­\nter and the not uncommon choice of consolation or friendship \nas a theme serve to keep up the air of the letter. Personal \nhappenings or surroundings are regularly made the occasion \nof, or the preliminary to, serious reflections in the abstract. \nThere are also biting condemnations of ways of life around \nthe writer, particularly among the bored and pleasure-seeking \nRoman aristocracy. Room is found too for culture, in an \nassimilable form, in balanced discussions of time-honoured \nphilosophical or ethical problems, 41 or in the development of \nthoughts on, for example, poetry, or physical phenomena, or \nstyle. \n* \n21\n\f\nINT RO DU CTION \nHis style \nStyle, with Seneca, is of considerable importance. Notwith­\nstanding his own condemnation41 of people who give less \nattention to what they have to say than to how they will say \nit, he is a signal example of a writer to whom form mattered \nas much as content. In writers like him (in what has conunonly \nbeen called the Silver Age of Latin literature), constant \nstriving after terseness and originality of expression gave rise \nto an arresting and not easily digested style. \nThere were reasons for the development of this 'pointed' \nstyle. With the passing of the Republic and succession of a \nseries of suspicious emperors there had been a diminution \nboth in the range of subject-matter which was safe and in the \npractical value of a training in rhetoric for a career in public \nlife. The leisured Roman (now increasingly over-leisured) \nturned his training to literary rather than political ends; and \nthe means to the prime new end of stylistic brilliance were \nthose of rhetoric. All this was encouraged by the fashion of \ngiving public readings of one's work, in which success almost \ncame to be measured by the ability of each and every sen­\ntence to win applause. Carried over, too, from the schools of \nrhetoric was a liking for sometimes daringly poetic words, \nespecially from Virgil, and artificial forms of expression more \ntypical of verse than prose. \nGoing with the overriding aim of pithin ess or epigrammatic \nbrevity (contrasting so greatl y with the style of Cicero a \ncentury before) was an indulgence in colloquialisms. Seneca's \nuse of popular turns of phrase and everyday expressions (a \npractice rare in Roman authors not writing for the comic \nstage or on technical subjects) and deliberate cultivation of the \neasy, conversational mann er are somehow reconciled with \ndements of style, even in the Letters, which to us seem highly \n2.2\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nwrought and polished. The exploitation of such figures as \nantithesis, alliteration, homeoteleuta and all mann er of other \nplays upon words,, paradox and oxymoron, apposition and \nasyndeton, the use of cases and prepositions in uncommon \nconnotations, all contribute to the twin aims of brevity and \nsparkle. \nThe result may read more naturally in Latin than it ever \ncould in English, but is none the less apt to leave the reader \n'dazzled and fatigued'. 43 All the wealth and ingenuity of \nepigram and illustration does not prevent us from feeling that \nthe sentences often simply 'repeat the same thought, clothed \nin constantly different guises, over and over again', as Fronto \ncomplained in the cen_tury following. And this reluctance, as \nit appears, to say what one has to say and then have done with \nit instead of continuing the restless manufacture of yet bolder, \nmore hard-hitting or more fmished sentences or proverbs, \nsometimes arouses the impatience of more modem readers. \nThere is Macaulay's celebrated statement in a letter to a \n6.-iend: 'I cannot bear Seneca ... His works are made up of \nmottoes. There is hardly a sentence which might not be \nquoted; but to read him straightforward is like dining on \nnothing but anchovy sauce.' Quintilian44 considered that \nSeneca, whom by and large he respected and admired, \nweakened the force of his teaching by his manner of writing, \nand others have wondered whether his style is not unworthy \nofhis subject. \nIt is interesting to hear Quintilian speaking of his struggle \nto win his students away from such models as Seneca (who, \nhe said, 'practically alone among authors was to be found on \nthe shelves of every young man at that time'). As an academi­\ncian who stood for orthodoxy and a return to the older or \nCiceronian manner, he could not bring himself to give the \nseal �f his approval to an author whose writing showed, in \nhis opinion, 'a degree of corruption all the more dangerous \n23\n\f\nINTR OD UCTION \nthrough the very attractiveness of the faults in which it \nabounds', and who had actually voiced the heresy: 'There \nare no fixed rules of style.'45 \n* \nHis influence and appeal \nWhile scholars and schoolmasters in the century following \ncontinued to condemn46 Seneca, early Christians were taking \nto this kindred spirit among pagan writers, so many of whose \nideas and attitudes they felt able to adopt or share. Anthologies \nwere made of him and he was frequently quoted by such \nwriters as Jerome, Lactantius and Augustine. Tertullian \ncalled him saepe noster, 'often one of us'. The extant set of \nletters purporting to be correspondence between Seneca and \nSt Paul (probably composed by a Christian, but apparently \nbelieved genuine until quite modern times) led Jerome to \ninclude him in his so called Catalogue of Saints, and no doubt \nhelps to explain his reputation in the middle ages, much as \nthe supposed prophecy of the birth of the Messiah in Virgil's \nFourth Eclogue helped to make the latter's name in Christen­\ndom. \nOnly Cicero, perhaps, among classical authors was better \nknown in medieval times, and until Aristotle was rediscovered \nby Western Europe, Seneca's main 'scientific' work, the \nNaturales Quaestiones, was the undisputed authority on the \nsubjects with which it dealt. Dante, Chaucer and Petrarch \nwere great admirers and quoters of his writings.47 Printing \nspread his influence, the first printed version of the Epistulae \nbeing published in or about I47S at Rome, Paris and Stras­\nbourg. Erasmus48 was the &st person to produce a critical \nedition (in ISIS) and Calv in's first work was an edition in \nIS32 of the De Clementia, an essay originally written to \n24\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nencourage clemency in Nero, and incidentally inspiring much \nof the 'quality of mercy' speech in the Merchant of Venice. \nMontaigne49 was the flrst, and the most conspicuously \nindebted, borrower from Seneca among the great modem \nliterary figures. Pasquier' s admiration for Montaigne prompted \nhim to say: 'As for his essays, which I call masterpieces, \nthere is no book in my possession which I have so greatly \ncherished. I always fmd something in it to please me. It is a \nFrench Seneca.' \nAppreciations of Seneca as a moralist may be quoted from \nmany sources. John of Salisbury is supposed to have said: 'If \nQuintilian will excuse my saying so, there are very few if any \nwriters on conduct among non-Christians whose words and \nideas can be more readily applied to all kinds of practical \nthings.' Emerson urged: 'Make your own Bible. Select and \ncollect all the words and sentences that in all your reading \nhave been to you like the blast of triumph out of Shakespeare, \nSeneca, Moses, John and Paul.' He is placed in even more \nexalted company by Baudelaire in his essay De l' Essence du \nRire, in which he seems at one point to be ascribing modem \ncivilized manners to 'Ia venue de Jesus, Platon et Seneque \naidant ' . In letters to Peter Gilles we find Erasmus writing (in \nthe words ofFroude) 'in fraternal good humour, advising him \nto be regular at his work, to keep a jouffial, to remember that \nlife was short, to study Plato and Seneca, love his wife, and \ndisregard the world's opinion'. Queen Elizabeth I 'did much \nadmire Seneca's wholesome advisings ', says her godson, Sir \nJohn Harington, who 'saw much of her translating thereof'. 50 \nAlthough great literary figures have usually been fondest of \nthe letters, it was his plays which, with all their faults, had the \ngreatest effect on European literature. 'If you seek Seneca's \nmemorial, look round on the tragic stage of England, France \nand Italy.'51 \nThe late Elizabethan age and early seventeenth century \n25\n\f\nIN TROD UC TION \nwere the high-water mark of Seneca's inBuence, as a writer \nwell known and imitated among lyric poets and essayists \nas well as dramatists. 51 His popularity lasted for some time in \nFrance, where his admirers induded Descartes , Comeille, \nLa Fontaine, Poussin, Rousseau, Diderot, Balzac and Sainte­\nBeuve, but disappeared almost altogether in England. The \nenthusiasm of, for example, De Quincey ('A nobler master \nof thinking Paganism has not to shew, nor, when the cant \nof criticism has done its worst, a more brilliant master of \ncomposition') is exceptional, and Seneca, at the present time, \nmay be called a forgotten author. \nNOTE ON TRAN SLATION AND TEXT \nTranslations, and the aims and methods (when they are \nventuresome enough to profess them) of individual trans­\nlators, are seldom hard to criticize. But however far men of \nletters may fmd themselves from agreement on the principles \nof translation from a classical author, the intelligent reader can \nno longer be satisfied with either a literal rendering - on the \npainful model of the old-fashioned school crib - or an in­\nspired paraphrase - however attractive the result has some­\ntimes been when poet has rendered poet. Somewhere between \nthese two kinds of offering lies the ideal translation, the aim \nof which I should define as the exact reproduction of the \noriginal without omission or addition, capturing its sound \n(form, style) as well as its sense (content, meaning). \nReproduction of the style presents, except with ordinary \nconversational or colloquial prose, formidable problems. The \npractitioner feels that the attempt is one which should be \nmade, even, in the case of poetry, with so difficult a feature of \nit as its metrical patterns. Yet the result must never be \nEnglish so unnatural or contrived (unless the original itself \nclearly set out to obtain such effects) that the reader cannot \n26\n\f\nIN TROD UCTION \nstomach it. And this consideration has tempered my feeling \nthat the brevity or rhetoric or other elements of Seneca's \nmann er should each be closely imitated. It is hardly possible, \nfor instan�, to reproduce the compression of such a sentence \nas Habere eripitur, habuisse numquam or Magis quis veneris \nquam quo interest. In this field of style it is never possible to \nclaim that a translation 'loses nothing' of the qualities of the \noriginal. \nFor when all is said and done a translation of a literary work \nmust be readable. To spare the reader the jars which remind \nhim that he is reading a translation, all but the few timeless \nv�rsions of the classical authors need to be revised or done \nafresh perhaps every half century. The same principle inci­\ndentally suggests that obscurities (allusions, for example, \nwhich only a Latinist would notice or appreciate} may be \nclarified or removed by slight expansion, and I have adopted \nthis practic,. very occasionally as an alternative to a distracting \nreference to a note. \nThe formal beginning and ending of each letter (Seneca \nLucilio suo salutem and Vale) is omitted.· Colloquialisqu \n(including the forms 'it's', 'wouldn't', etc. and the everyday \nhabit of ending sentences with prepositions) will be noticed \nhere and there; they have been used only where Seneca's \nlanguage is thoroughly colloquial or where he is arguing in \nthe second person with an imaginary interjector. \nIf an earlier translatpr has hit on a phrase which one \nbecomes (unwillingly) convinced cannot be bettered, it is \nsurely absurd - the more so if one believes that there is almost \nalways only one best rendering in the language of the trans­\nlator's day - to proceed with a poorer or less accurate one \nmerely for the sake of originality. I am indebted in this way \nin a number of places to Gummere and Barker, the trans­\nlators in the Loeb (1917-25) and Clarendon Press (1932) \nversions respectively."

So always read well­\ntried authors, and if at any moment you find yourself wanting \na change from a particular author, go back to ones you have \nread bef ore. \nEach day, too, acquire something which will help you to \nfa ce poverty, or death, and other ills as well. Af ter running \nover a lot of diff erent thoughts, pick out one to be digested \nthoroughly that day. This is what I do myself; out of the many \nbits I have been reading I lay hold of one. My thought fo r \ntoday is something which I fo und in Epicurus (yes, I actually \nmake a practice of going over to the enemy's camp-by way of \nreconnaissance, not as a deserter!). 'A cheerful poverty,' he \nsays, 'is an honourable state.' But if it is cheerful it is not \npoverty at all. It is not the man who has too little who is \npoor, but the one who hankers af ter more. What diff erence \ndoes it make how much there is laid away in a man's saf e or \nin his barns, how many head of stock he grazes or how much \ncapital he puts out at interest, if he is always af ter what is \nanother's and only counts what he has yet to get, never what \nhe has already. You ask what is the proper limit to a person's \nwealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having \nwhat is enough. \nLE TTER III \nYou have sent me a letter by the hand of a 'fri end' of yours, \nas you call him. And in the next sentence you warn me to \navoid d.iscussing your affairs freely with him, since you arc \n34\n\f\nm, 4 LETTER III \nnot even in the habit of doing so yourself; in other words \nyou have described him as being a friend and then denied \nthis in one and the same letter. Now if you were using that \nword in a kind of popular sense and not according to its \nstrict meaning, and calling him a 'friend' in much the same \nway as we refer to candidates as 'gentlemen ' or hail someone \nwith the greeting 'm y dear fellow ' if when we meet him his \nname slips our memory, we can let this pass. But if you are \nlooking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as \nyou trust yourself, you are making a grave mistake, and have \nfailed to grasp sufficiently the ful l force of true friendship. \nCertainly you should discuss everything with a friend; but \nbefore you do so, discuss in your mind the man himsel£ \nAfter friendship is formed you must trust, but before that \nyou must judge. Those people who, contrary to Theophrastus' \nadvice, judge a man after they have made him their friend \ninstead of the other way round, certainly put the cart before \nthe horse. Think for a long time whether or not you should \nadmit a given person to your friendship. But when you have \ndecided to do so, welcome him heart and soul, and speak as \nunreservedly with him as you would with yourself. You \nshould, I need hardly say, live in such a way that there is \nnothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as \nkeep to yourself; but seeing that certain matters do arise on \nwhich convention decrees silence, the things you should \nshare with your friend are all your worries and deliberations. \nRegard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. Some \nmen' s fear of being deceived has taught people to deceive \nthem ; by their suspiciousness they give them the right to do \nthe wrong thing by them. Why should I keep back anything \nwhen I'm with a friend? Why shouldn't I imagine I'm alone \nwhen I'm in his company? \nThere are certain people who tell any person they meet \nthings that should only be confided to friends, unburdening \n35 \n.-.\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC m, 4 \nthemselves of whatever is on their minds into any ear they \nplease. Others again are shy of confiding in their closest \nfriends, and would not even let themselves, if they could help \nit, into the secrets they keep hidden deep down inside them­\nselves. We should do neither. Trusting everyone is as much a \nfault as trusting no one (though I should call the first the \nworthier and the second the safer behaviour). \nSimilarly, people who never relax and people who are \ninvariably in a relaxed state merit your disapproval - the \nformer as much as the latter. For a delight in bustling about \nis not industry - it is only the restless energy of a hunted \nmind. And the state 'of mind that looks on all activity as \ntiresome is not true repose, but a spineless inertia. This \nprompts me to memorize something which I came across in \nPomponius. 'S ome men have shrunk so far into dark comers \nthat objects in bright daylight seem quite blurred to them.' \nA balanced combination of the two attitudes is what we \nwant; the active man should be able to take things easily, \nwhile the man who is inclined towards repose should be \ncapable of action. Ask nature: she will tell you that she made \nboth day and night. \nLETTER V \nI VIEW with plea5ure and approval the way you keep on at \nyour studies and sacrifice everything to your single-minded \nefforts to make yourself every day a better man . I do not \nmerely urge you to persevere in this; I actually implore you \nto. Let me give you, though, this one piece of advice : re­\nfrain from following the example of those whose craving is \nfor attention, not their own improvement, by doing certain \n36\n\f\nv, s LBTTBR V \nthings which are calculated to give rise to comment on your \nappearance or way of living generally. Avoid shabby attire, \nlong hair, an unkempt beard, an outspoken dislike of silver­\nware, sleeping on the ground and all other misguided means \nto self-advertisement. The very name of philosophy, how­\never modest the manner in which it is pursued, is unpopular \nenough as it is: imagine what the reaction would be if we \nstarted dissociating ourselves from the conventions of society. \nInwardly everything should be different but our outward \nface should conform with the crowd. Our clothes should not \nbe gaudy, yet they should not be dowdy either. We should \nnot keep silver plate with inlays of solid gold, but at the same \ntime we should not imagine that doing without gold and \nsilver is proof that we are leading the simple life. Let our \naim be a way of life not diametrically opposed to, but better \nthan that of the mob. Otherwise we shall repel and alienate \nthe very people whose reform we desir e; we shall make \nthem, moreover, reluctant to imitate us in anything for fear \nthey may have to imitate us in everything. The first thing \nphilosophy promises us is the feeling offellowship, of belong­\ning to mankind and being members of a community; being \ndiff erent will mean the abandoning of that manifesto. We \nmust watch that the means by which we hope to gain admira­\ntion do not earn ridicule and hostility. Our motto, as every­\none knows, is to live in conformity with nature: it is quite \ncontrary to nature to torture one's body, to reject simple \nstandards of cleanliness and make a point of being dirty, to \nadopt a diet that is not just plain but hideous and revolting. \nIn the same way as a craving for dainties is a token of extrava­\ngant living, avoidance of familiar and inexpensive dishes \nbetokens insanity. Philosophy calls for simple living, not for \ndoing penance, and the simple way of life need not be a \ncrude one. The standard which I accept is this: one's life \nshould be a compromise between the ideal and the popular \n37\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC v, S \nmorality. People should admire our way of life but they \nshould at the same time fmd it understandable. \n'D oes that mean we are to act just like other people? Is \nthere to be no distinction between us and them?' Most \ncertainly there is. Any close observer should be aware that \nwe are different from the mob. Anyone entering our homes \nshould admire us rather than our furnishings. It is a great \nman th,at can treat his earthenware as if it was silver, and a \nman who treats his silver as if it was earthenware is no less \ngreat. Finding wealth an intolerable burden is the mark of an \nunstable mind. \nBut let me share with you as usual the day's small fmd \n(which today is something that I noticed in the Stoic writer \nHecato). Limiting one's desires actually helps to cure one of \nfear. 'C ease to hope,' he says, 'and you will cease to fear.' \n'B ut how,' you will ask, 'can things as diverse as these be \nlinked?' Well, the fact is, Lucilius, that they are bound up \nwith one another, unconnected as they may seem. Widely \ndifferent though they are, the two of them march in unison \nlike a prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps \npace with hope. Nor does their so moving together surprise \nme; both belong to a mind in suspense, to a mind in a state \nof anxiety through looking into the future. Both are mainly \ndue to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us instead of \nadapting ourselves to the present. Thus it is that foresight, \nthe greatest blessing humanity has been given, is transformed \ninto a curse. Wild animals run from the dangers they actually \nsee, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We \nho_wever are tormented alike by what is past and what is to \ncome. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory \nbrings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on \nprematurely. No one confmes his unhappiness to the present."

Naturally there are a lot of things \nabout me requiring to be built up or fined down or diminated. \nEven this, the fact that it perceives the failmgs it was unaware \nof in itself before, is evidence of a change for the better in \none's character. In the case of some sick people it is a matter \nfor congratulation when they come to realize for themselves \nthat they are sick. \nI should very much like, then, to share this all so sudden \nmetamorphosis of mine with you. Doing so would make me \nstart to feel a surer faith in the friendship that exists between \nus, that true friendship which not hope nor fear nor concern \nfor personal advantage ever sunders, that friendship in which \nand for which people are ready to die. I can give you plenty \nof examples of people who have not been lacking a friend \nbut friendship, something that can never happen when \nmutual inclination draws two personalities together in a \nfellowship of desire for all that is honourable. Why cannot it \nhappen? Because they know that everything - and especially \ntheir setbacks - is shared between them. \nYou can't imagine how much of an alteration I see each \nday bringing about in me. 'S end me, too,' you will be saying, \n't he things you've found so eff ectual.' Indeed I desire to \ntransfer every one of them to you ; part of my joy in learning \nis that it puts me in a position to teach ; nothing, however \noutstanding and however helpf ul, will ever give me any \npleasure if the knowledge is to be for my benefit alone. If \nwisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should \n39\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC \nkeep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should \nreject it. There is no enjoying the possession of anything \nvaluable unless one has someone to share it with. I shall send \nyou, accordingly, the actual books themselves, and to save \nyou a lot of trouble hunting all over the place for passages \nlikely to be of use to you, I shall mark the passages so that \nyou can turn straight away to the words I approve and admire. \nPersonal converse, though, and daily intimacy with some­\none will be of more benef1t to you than any discourse. You \nshould really be here and on the spot, firstly because people \nbelieve their eyes rather more than their ears, and secondly \nbecause the road is a long one if one proceeds by way of \nprecepts but short and eff ectual if by way of personal example. \nCleanthes would never have been the image of Zeno if he \nhad merely heard him lecture ; he lived with him, studied his \nprivate life, watched him to see if he lived in accordance with \nhis own principle. Plato, Aristotle and a host of other philo­\nsophers all destined to take different paths, derived more \nfrom Socrates' character than from his words. It was not \nEpicu.rus' school but living under the same roof as Epicurus \nthat turned Metrodorus, Hermarchus and Polyaenus into \ngreat men. And yet I do not sunuuon you to my side solely \nfor the sake of your own progress but for my own as well, \nfor we shall be of the utmost benefit to each other. \nMeanwhile, since I owe you the daily allowance, I'll tell \nyou what took my fancy in the writings of Hecato today. \n'What progress have I made? I am beginning to be my own \nfriend.' That is progress indeed. Such a person will never be \nalone, and you may be sure he is a friend of all \n40"

    "raw_text": "vu, 3 \nLETTER VII \nYou ask me to say what you should consider it particularly \nimportant to avoid. My answer is this: a mass crowd. It is \nsomething to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without \nrisk. I at any rate am ready to confess my o� frailty in this \nrespect. I never come back home with quite the same moral \ncharacter I went out with; something or other becomes uri.­\nsettled where I had achieved internal peace, some one or \nother of the things I had put to flight reappears on the scene. \nWe who are recovering from a prolonged spiritual sickness \nare in the same condition as invalids who have been affected \nto such an extent by prolonged indisposition that they cannot \nonce be taken out of doors without ill effects. Associating \nwith people in large numbers is actually harmful: there is \nnot one of them that will not make some vice or other \nattractive to us, or leave us carrying the imprint of it or \nbedaubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the \nlarger the size of the crowd we mingle with, the greater the \ndanger. But nothing is as ruinous to the cl.racter as sjtting \naway one's time at a show- for it is then, through the medium \nof entertainment, that vices creep into one with more than \nusual ease. What do you take me to mean? That I go home \nmore selfish, more self-seeking and more self-indulgent? \nYes, and what is more, a person crueller and leSs ·humane \nthrough having been in contact with human beings. I hap­\npened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch-hour \ninterlude, expecting there to be some light and witty enter­\ntainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording \npeople's eyes a rest from human blood. Far from it. All the \nearlier contests were charity in comparison. The nonsense is \ndispensed with now: what we have now is murder pure and \n41\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC vn , 3 \nsimple. The combatants have nothing to protect them; their \nwhole bodies are exposed to the blows; every thrust they \nlaunch gets home. A great many spectators prefer this to the \nordinary matches and even to the special, popular demand \nones. And quite naturally. There are no hdmets and no \nshields repelling the weapons. What is the point of armour? \nOr of skill? All that sort of thing just makes the death slower \nin coming. In the morning men are thrown to the lions and \nthe bears: but it is the spectators they are thrown to in the \nlunch hour. The spectators insist that each on killing his man \nshall be thrown against another to be killed in his turn; and \nthe eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form \nof butchery; the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire \nand steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens \nwhile the arena is virtually empty. \n'But he was a highway robber, he killed a man.' And what \nof it? Granted that as a murderer he deserved this punishment, \nwhat have you done, you wretched fellow, to deserve to \nwatch it? 'Ki ll him ! Flog him ! Burn him ! Why does he run \nat the other man's weapon in such a cowardly way? Why \nisn't he less half-hearted about killing? Why isn't he a bit \nmore enthusiastic about dying? Whip him forward to get \nhis wounds! Make them each offer the other a bare breast \nand trade blow for blow on them.' And when there is an \ninterval in the show: 'Let's have some throats cut in the \nmeantime, so that there's something happening!' Come now, \nI say, surely you people realize- if you realize nothing dse ­\nthat bad examples have a way of recoiling on those who set \nthem? Give thanks to the immortal gods that the men to \nwhom you are giving a lesson in cruelty are not in a position \nto profit from it. \nWhen a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a \nhold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: \nit is so easy for it to go over to the majority. A Socrates, a \n42.\n\f\nVII, 10 LETTER VII \nCato or a Laelius might have been shaken in his principles by a \nmultitude of people dilf erent fr om himself: such is the measure \nof the inability of any of us, even as we perf ect our personality's \nadjustment, to withstand the onset of vices when they come \nv.jth such a mighty fo llowing. A single example of extrava­\ngance or greed does a lot of harm - an intimate who leads a \npampered lif e gradually makes one sof t and flabby ; a wealthy \nneighbour provokes cravings in one; a companion with a \nmalicious nature tends to rub off some of his rust even on \nsomeone of an innocent and open-hearted nature - what \nthen do you imagine the eff ect on a person's character is \nwhen the assault comes from the world at large? You must \ninevitably either hate or imitate the world. But the right \nthing is to shun both courses: you should neither become like \nthe bad because they are many, nor be an enemy of the many \nbecause they are unlike you. Retire into yourself as much as \nyou can. Associate with people who are likely to improve \nyou. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving. \nThe process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach. And \nthere is no reason why any pride in advertising your talents \nabroad should lure you fo rward into the public eye, inducing \nyou to give readings of your works or deliver lectures. I \nshould be glad to see you doing that if what you had to off er \nthem was suitable fo r the crowd I have been talking about: \nbut the fa ct is, not one of them is really capable of under­\nstanding you. You might perhaps come across one here and \nt-.here, but even they would need to be trained and developed \nby you to a point where they could grasp your teaching.' For \nwhose benefi t, then, did I learn it all ?' If it was fo r your own \nbenefit that you learnt it you have no call to fea r that your \ntrouble may have been wasted. \nJust to make sure that I have not been learning solely fo r \nmy own benefit today, let me share with you three fine \nquotations I have come across, each concerned with some-\n43\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC VII, IO \nthing like the same idea - one of them is by way of payment \nof the usual debt so far as this letter is concerned, and the other \ntwo you are to regard as an advance on account. 'To me,' \nsays Democritus, 'a single man is a crowd, and a crowd is a \nsingle man.' Equally good is the answer given by the person, \nwhoever it was (his identity is uncertain), who when asked \nwhat was the object of all the trouble he took over a piece of \ncraftsmanship when it would never reach more than a very \nfew people, replied : 'A few is enough for me; so is one; and \nso is none.' The third is a nice expression used by Epicurus \nin a letter to one of his colleagues. 'I am writing this,' he \nsays, 'not for the eyes of the many, but for yours alone: for \neach of us is audience enough for the other.' Lay these up in \nyour heart, my dear Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure \nthat comes from the majority's approval. The many speak \nhighly of you, but have you really any grounds for satis­\nfaction with yourself if you are the kind of person the many \nunderstand? Your merits should not be outward facing. \nLETTER VIII \n• ARE you, of all people ', you write, 'really telling me to \navoid the crowd, to retire from the world and fmd content· \nment in a good conscience? Where are those Stoic rules of \nyours that call on a man to die in harness?' Come now, do I \nreally give you the impression that I advocate a life of in­\nactivity? I have only buried myself away behind closed doors \nin order to be able to be of use to more people. With me no \nday is ever whiled away at ease. I claim a good part of my \nnights for study; I have no time for sleep: I just succumb to it, \nkeeping my eyes at their work when they are heavy-lidded \nand exhausted from lack of rest. I have withdrawn from aff airs \n44\n\f\nvm, s LETTER VIII \nas well as from society, and from my own affairs in particular: \n1 am acting on behalf of later generations. I am writing down \na few things that may be of use to them; I am conunitting to \nwriting some helpful recommendations, which might be \ncompared to the formulae of successful medications, the \neffectiveness of which I have experienced in the case of my \nown sores, which may not have been completely cured but \nhave at least ceased to spread. I am pointing out to others the \nright path, which I have recognized only late in life, when I \nam worn out with my wanderings. 'Avoid,' I cry, 'whatever \nis approved of by the mob, and things that are the gift of \nchance. Whenever circumstance brings some welcome thing \nyour way, stop in suspicion and alarm: wild animals and fish \nalike are taken in by this or that inviting prospect. Do you \nlook on them as presents given you by fortune? They are \nsnares. Anyone among you who wishes to lead a secure life \nwill do his very best to steer well wide of these baited bounties, \nwhich comprise yet another instance of the errors we miser­\nable creatures fall into: we think these things are ours when \nin fact it is we who are caught. That track leads to precipices; \nlife on that giddy level ends in a f all. Once, moreover, \nprosperity begins to carry us off course, we are no more \ncapable even of bringing the ship to a standstill than of going \ndown with the consolation that she has been held on her course, \nor of going down once and for all ; fortune does not just \ncapsize the boat: she hurls it headlong on the rocks and \ndashes it to pieces. Cling, therefore, to this sound and whole­\nsome plan of life: indulge the body just so far as suffices for \ngood health. It needs to be treated somewhat strictly to \nprevent it from being disobedient to the spirit. Your food \nshould appease your hunger, your drink quench your thirst, \nyour clothing keep out the cold, your house be a protection \nagainst inclement weather. It makes no difference whether \nit is built of turf or of variegated marble imported from another \n4S\n\f\nLETTER S FROM A STOIC vm , S \ncountry: what you have to understand is that thatch makes a \nperson just as good a roof as gold does. Spurn everything \nthat is added on by way of decoration and display by un­\nnecessary labour. Reflect that nothing merits admiration \nexcept the spirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it \nfrom being impressed by anything.' \nIf these are the things I'm saying to myself, if these are the \nthings I'm saying to future generations, don't you think I'm \ndoing more good than when I go into court to enter into a \nrecognizance on someone' s behalf, or stamp my seal on a will, \nor lend my assistance by word or action in the Senate to some \ncandidate for office? Those who appear inactive are, believe \nme, engaged in far more important activity; they're dealing \nwith matters divine and human at the same moment. \nBut the time has come to make an end, and in accordance \nwith the practice I've started to make some disbursement on \nthis letter's behal£ For this I shall not draw on my own re­\nsources. I'm still turning over the pages of Epicurus, and the \nfollowing saying, one I read today, comes from him: 'To \nwin true freedom you must be a slave to philosophy.' A \nperson who surrenders and subjects himself to her doesn't \nhave his application deferred from day to day ; he's emanci­\npated on the spot, the very service of philosophy being free­\ndom. \nQuite possibly you'll be demanding to know why I'm \nquoting so many fine sayings from Epicurus rather than ones \nbelonging to our own school. But why should you think of \nthem as belonging to Epicurus and not as common property? \nThink how many poets say things that philosophers have \nsaid - or ought to have said ! Not to mention the tragedians \n·or our native Roman drama (which has a serious element in \nit as well and stands halfway between comedy and tragedy), \nthink of the quantity of brilliant lines to be found lying about \nin farces alone! Think of the number of Publilius' verses that \n46\n\f\nIX,.Z LETTER IX \nreally ought to be spoken by actors wearing the tragic buskins \ninstead of barefooted pantomime actors! I'll quote one \nverse of his which belongs to philosophy, and the same facet \nof philosophy that I was occupied with just now, a verse in \nwhich he proclaims that gifts which chance brings our way \nare not to be regarded as possessions: \nIf you pray a thing may \nAnd it does come your way, \n'Tis a long way from being your own. \nI recall your expressing the same idea a good deal more \nhappily and succinctly: \nWhat fortune has made yours is not your own. \nAnd I can't pass over that even happier expression of yours: \nThe boon that could be given can be withdrawn. \n(This being from your own stock. I'm not debiting it to \nyour account!) \nLETTER IX \nYou desire to know whether Epicurus is right in one of \nhis letters in criticizing those who maintain that the wise \nman is content with himself and therefore needs no friend. \nThis is what Epicurus objects to in Stilbo and those* who \nbelieve that the supreme ideal in life is a mind devoid of \nfeeling or as we say impatiens. We are bound to involve our­\nselves in ambiguity if we try to express in a single word the \nmeaning of the Greek term apatheia by transferring it straight \ninto our word impatientia. For it may be understood in the \n* Philosophers of the Cynic schooL \n47\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC IX, .2. \nopposite sense to the one we wish, with people taking it to \nsignify the man who is unable to endure anything that goes \nbadly for him instead of what we mean by it, the man who \nrefuses to allow anything that goes badly for him to affect \nhim. Consider then whether it might not be preferable to \ncall it a mind that is 'invulnerab le' or 'above all suffering'. \nThe difference here between the Epicurean and our own \nschool is this: our wise man feels his troubles but overcomes \nthem, while their wise man does not even feel them. We \nshare with them the belief that the wise man is content with \nhimself. Nevertheless, self-sufficient though he is, he still \ndesires a friend, a neighbour, a companion. Notice how self­\ncontented he is: on occasion such a man is content with a \nmere partial self- ifhe loses a hand as a result of war or disease, \nor has one 9f his eyes, or even both, put out in an accident, \nhe will be satisfied with what remains of himself and be no \nless pleased with his body now that it is maimed and incom­\nplete than he was when it was whole. But while he does not \nhanker after what he has lost, he does prefer not to lose them. \nAnd this is what we mean when we say the wise man is self­\ncontent ; he is so in the sense that he is able to do without \nfriends, not that he desires to do without them. When I \nspeak of his being 'able ' to do this, what I am saying in \nfact amounts to this: he bears the loss of a friend with equa­\nnimity. \nNot that he will then be without a friend, for it is his to \ndecide how soon he makes good the loss. Just as Phidias can \ncarve another statue straight away if he loses one, so our wise \nman with his skill in the art of making friends will fill the \nplace of someone he has lost. I suppose you will want to \nknow how he will be able to make a friend so quickly. Well, \nI shall tell you (provided we agree that I may make this the \nmoment to pay my debt and square my account so far as \nthis letter is concerned). 'I shall show you,' said Hecato, 'a \n48\n\f\nIX, 9 LETTER IX \nlove philtre compounded without drug or herb or witch's \nspell. It is this : if you wish to be loved, love.' \nGreat pleasure is to be found not only in keeping up an \nold and established friendship but also in beginning and build­\ning up a new one. There is the same difference between having \ngained a friend and actually gaining a friend as there is between \na farmer harvesting and a farmer sowing. The philosopher \nAttalus used to say that it was more of a pleasure to make a \nfriend than to have one, 'in the same way as an artist derives \nmore pleasure from painting than from having completed a \npicture'. When his whole attention is absorbed in concentra­\ntion on the work he is engaged on, a tremendous sense of \nsatisfaction is created in him by his very absorption. There is \nnever quite the same gratification after he has lif ted his hand \nfrom the finished work. From then on what he is enjoying is \nthe art's end product, whereas it was the art itself that he \nenjoyed while he was actually painting. So with our children, \ntheir growing up brings wider fruits but their infancy was \nsweeter. \nTo come back to the question, the wise man, self-sufficient \nas he is, still desires to have a friend if only for the purpose of \npractising friendship and ensuring that those talents are not \nidle. Not, as Epicurus put it in the same letter, 'for the purpose \nof having someone to come and sit beside his bed when he is \nill or come to his rescue when he is hard up or thrown into \nchains', but so that on the contrary he may have someone by \nwhose sickbed he himself may sit or whom he may himself \nrelease when that person is held prisoner by hostile hands. \nAnyone thinking of his own interests and seeking out friend­\nship with this in view is making a great mistake. Things will \nend as they began; he has secured a friend who is going to \ncome to his aid if captivity threatens : at the first clank of a \nchain that friend will disappear. These are what are commonly \ncalled £air-weather friendships. A person adopted as a friend \n49\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC IX, 9 \nfor the sake of his usefuln ess will be cultivated only for so \nlong as he is useful. This explains the crowd of friends that \nclusters about successful men and the lonely atmosphere \nabout the ruined - their friends runn ing away when it comes \nto the testing point; it explains the countless scandalous \ninstances of people deserting or betraying others out of fear \nfor themselves. The ending inevitably matches the beginnin g: \na person who starts being friends with you because it pays him \nwill similarly cease to be friends because it pays him to do so. \nIf there is anything in a particular friendship that attracts a \nman other than the friendship itself, the attraction of some \nreward or other will counterbalance that of the friendship. \nWhat is my object in making a friend ? To have someone to \nbe able to die for, someone I may follow into exile, someone \nfor whose life I may put myself up as security and pay the \nprice as well. The thing you describe is not friendship but a \nbusiness deal , looking to the likely consequences, with \nadvanta,ge as its goal. There can be no doubt that the desire \nlovers have for each other is not so very different from \nfriendship - you might say it was friendship gone mad. \nWell , then, does anyone ever fall in love with a view to a \nprofit, or advancement, or celeb rity? Actual love in itself, \nheedless of all other considerations, inflames people's hearts \nwith a passion for the beautiful object, not without the hope, \ntoo, that the affection will be mutual. How then can ·the \nnobler stimulus of friendship be associated with any ignoble \ndesire? \nYou may say we are not at present concerned with the \nquestion whether friendship is something to be cultivated for \nits own sake. But this, on the contrary, is exactly what needs \nproving most ; for if friendship is something to be sought \nout for its own sake, the self-contented man is entitled to \npursue it. And how does he approach it? In.. the same way as \nhe would any object of great beauty, not drawn by gain, not \nso\n\f\nIX, 16 LETTER IX \nout of alarm at the vicissitudes of fortune. To procure \nfriendship only for better and not for worse is to rob it of all \nits dignity. . \n'The wise man is content with himsel£' A lot of people, \nLucilius, put quite the wrong interpretation on this statement. \nThey remove the wise man from all contact with the world \noutside, shutting him up inside his own skin. We must be \nquite clear about the meanin g of this sentence and just how \nmuch it claims to say. It applies to him so far as happiness in \nlife is concern ed : for this all he needs is a rational and elevated \nspirit that treats fortune with disdain ; for the actual business \nof living he needs a great number of things. I should like to \ndraw your attention to a similar distinction made by \nChrysippus. The wise man, he said, lacked nothing but \nneeded a great number of things, whereas 'the fool, on the \nother hand, needs nothing (for he does not know how to use \nanything) but lacks everything.' The wise man needs hands \nand eyes and a great number of things that are required for \nthe purposes of day-to-day life ; but he lacks nothing, for \nlacking something implies that it is a necessi ty and nothing, to \nthe wise man, is a necessity. \nSelf-contented as he is, then, he does need friends - and \nwants as many of them as possible - but not to enable him to \nlead a happy life ; this he will have even without friends. The \nsupreme ideal does not call for any external aids. It is home­\ngrown, wholly self-developed. Once it starts looking outside \nitself for any part of itself it is on the way to being dominated \nby fortune. \n'But what sort of life,' people may say, 'will the wise man \nhave if he is going to be left without any friends when he is \nthrown into prison or stranded among foreigners or detained \nin the course of a voyage in distant parts or cast away on \nsome desert shore?' It will be like that of Jove while nature \ntakes her rest, of brief duration. when the universe is dissolved \nSI\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC IX, 16 \nand the gods are all merged in one, fmding repose in himself, \nabsorbed in his own thoughts. Such is more or less the way of \nthe wise man: he retires to his inner self, is his own company. \nSo long in fact as he remains in a position to order his aff airs \naccording to his own judgement, he remains self-content \neven when he marries, even when he brings up his children. \nHe is self-content and yet he would refuse to live if he had to \nlive without any human company at all. Natural promptings \n{not thoughts of any advantage to himself) impd him to­\nwards friendship. We are born with a sense of the pleasantness \nof friendship just as of other things. In the same way as there \nexists in man a distaste for solitude and a craving for society, \nnatural instinct drawing one human being to another, so \ntoo with this there is something inherent in it that stimulates \nus into seeking friendships. The Wise man, nevertheless, \nunequalled though he is in his devotion to his friends, though \nregarding them as being no less important and frequently \nmore important than his own self, will still consider what is \nvaluable in lif e to be something wholly confined to his inner \nsel£ He will repeat the words of Stilbo (the Stilbo whom \nEpicurus' letter attacks), when his home town was captured \nand he . emerged from the general conflagration, his children \nlost, his wif e lost, alone and none the less a happy man, and \nwas questioned by Demetrius. Asked by this man, known, \nfrom the destruction he deal t out to towns, as Demetrius the \nCity Sacker, whether he had lost anything, he replied, 'I have \nall my valuables with me.' There was an active and courageous \nman - victorious over the very victory of the enemy! 'I \nhave lost,' he said, 'nothing.' He made Demetrius wonder \nwhether he had won a victory after all. 'All my possessions,' \nhe said, 'are with me', meaning by this the qualities of a just, \na good and an enlightened character, and indeed the very fact \nof not regarding as valuable anything that is capable of being \ntaken away. We are impressed at the way some creatures \n52\n\f\nIX, 22 LETTER IX \npass right through fire without physical harm: how much \nmore impressive is the way this man came through the \nburning and the bloodshed and the ruins uninjured and un­\nscathed. Does it make you see how much easier it can be to \nconquer a whole people than to conquer a single man? \nThose words of Stilbo's are equally those of the Stoic. He \ntoo carries his valuables intact through cities burnt to ashes, \nfor he is contented with hirnsel£ This is the line he draws as \nthe boundary for his happiness. \nIn case you imagine that we Stoics are the only people who \nproduce noble sayings, let me tell you something - see that \nyou put this down to my credit, even though I have already \nsettled my account with you for today - Epicurus himself, \nwlio has nothing good to say for Stilbo, has uttered a state­\nment quite like this one of Stil bo's. 'Any man,' he says, 'who \ndoes not think that what he has is more than ample, is an \nunhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.' \nOr if you prefer to see it expressed like this (the point being \nthat we should be ruled not by the actual words used but by the \nsense of them), 'a man is unhappy, though he reign the world \nover, if he does not consider himself supremdy happy.' To \nshow you, indeed, that these are sentiments of a universal \ncharacter, prompted, evidently, by nature herself, you will \nfind the following verse in a comic poet: \nNot happy he who thinks himself not so.* \nWhat difference does it make, after all, what your position in \nlife is if you dislike it yourself? \n'What about so-and-so,' you may ask, 'who became rich \nin such a despicable manner, or such-and-such a person who \ngives orders to a great many people but is at the mercy of a \ngreat many more?

All foolishness suf fe rs \nthe burden of dissatisf action with itself . \nLETTER XI \nI HA VB had a conversation with your talented mend. From \nthe very beginning of his talk with me it was apparent what \nconsiderable gifts of character and intelligence he possesse s. \nHe gave me a fo retaste of his capabilities, to which he will \ncertainly live up, fo r the things he said, caught as he was \nquite off his guard, were entirely unrehearsed. As he was \nrecovering his self -possession, he could scarcely get over his \nembarrassment - always a good sign in a young man - so \ndeep had the blush been that suff used his fa ce. This I rather \nsuspect will remain with him even when he has built up his \ncharacter and stripped it of all weakness - even when he has \nbecome a wise man. For no amount of wisdom enables one \nto do away with physical or mental weaknesses that arise \nfrom natural causes; anything inborn or ingrained in one can \nby dint of practice be allayed , but not overcome. When they \nface a crowd of people some men, even ones with the stoutest \nof hearts, break into the sort of sweat one usually sees on \npersons in an overheated and exhausted state; some men \nexperience a trembling at the knees when they are about to \nspeak; some a chattering of the teeth, a stuttering tongue or \nstammering lips. These are things which neither training \nnor experience ever eliminates. Nature just wields her power \nand uses the particular weakness to make even the strongest \n54\n\f\nXI , 7 LBTTBR XI \nconscious of her. One of these things I well know is a blush, \nwhich has a habit of suddenly redde� the faces of men of \neven the most dignified demeanour. It is of course more \nnoticeable in the young, with their hotter blood and sensitive \ncomplexions; neverthdess seasoned men and ageing men alike \nare aff ected by it. Some men are more to be feared on the \noccasions when they flush than at any other time - as if in so \ndoing they let loose all their inhibitions; Sulla was at his \nwildest when the blood had rushed to his visage. No features \nwere more susceptible than Pompey's: he never failed to \nblush in company, and particularly at public meetings. I \nremember Fabianus blushing when he appeared to give \nevidence bef ore the Senate, and this bashfulness looked \nwonderfully well on him. When this happens it is not due to \nsome mental infirmity, but to the unfamiliarity of some situa­\ntion or other, which may not necessarily strike any alarm into \ninexperienced people but does produce a reaction in them if \nthey are thus liable through having a natural, physical pr� \ndisposition to it; certain people have good, ordinary blood \nand others just have an animated, livdy sort of blood that \ncomes to the face quickly. \nNo amount of wisdom, as I said before, ever banishes \nthese things; otherwise - if she eradicated every weakness -\nwisdom would have dominion over the world of nature. \nOne's physical make-up and the attributes that were one's \nlot at birth remain settled no matter how much or how long \nthe personality may strive after perfect adjustment. One \ncannot ban these things any more than one can call them up. \nThe tokens used to portray embarrassment by professional \nactors, those actors who portray emotion, simulate unhappiness \nand reproduce for us fear and apprehension, are a hanging \nof the head, a dropping of the voice, a casting down of the \neyes and keeping them fixed on the ground; a blush is som� \nthing they can never manage to reproduce; it is something that \nss\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC xr, 7 \nwill neither be summ oned up nor be told to stay away. Against \nthese things philosophy holds out no remedy and avails one \nnothing ; they are quite independent; they come unbidden, they \ngo unbidden. \nMy letter calls fo r a conclusion. Here's one fo r you, one \nthat will serve you in good stead, too, which I'd like you to \ntake to heart. 'We need to set our aff ections on some good \nman and keep him constantly bef ore our eyes, so that we may \nlive as if he were watching us and do everything as if he saw \nwhat we were doing.' This, my dear Lucilius, is Epicurus' \nadvice, and in giving it he has given us a guardian and a moral \ntutor - and not without reason, either: misdeeds are greatly \ndiminished if a witness is always standing near intending \ndoers. The personality should be provided with someone it \ncan revere, . someone whose influence can make even its \nprivate, inner lif e more pure. Happy the man who improves \nother people not merdy when he is in their presence but even \nwhen he is in their thoughts! And happy, too, is the person \nwho can so revere another as to adjust and shape his own \npersonality in the light of recollections, even, of that other. A \nperson able to revere another thus will soon deserve to be \nrevered himself . So choose yourself a Cato -o r, if Cato seems \ntoo severe fo r you, a Laelius, a man whose character is not \nquite so strict. Choose someone whose way of lif e as well as \nwords, and whose very fa ce as mirroring the character that lies \nbehind it, have won your approval. Be always pointing him \nout to yourself either as your guardian or as your model. \nThere is a need, in my view, fo r someone as a standard against \nwhich our characters can measure themselves. Without a \nruler to do it against you won't make the crooked straight."

I \nvisited my place just out of Rome recently and was grumbling \nabout the expense of maintaining the building, which was in a \ndilapidated state. My manager told me the trouble wasn't \ndue to any neglect on his part: he was doing his utmost but \nthe house was old. That house had taken shape under my \nown hands; what's to become of me if stones of my own age \nare crumbling like that? Losing my temper I seized at the \nfirst excuse that presented itself for venting my irritation on \nhim. 'It's quite clear,' I said, 'that these plane trees are being \nneglected. There's no foliage on them. Look at those knotty, \ndried-up branches and those wre tched, Baking trunks. That \nwouldn't happen if someone dug round them and watered \nthem.' He swore by my guardian angd he was doing his \nutmost: in ev erytl:llng his care was unremitting but the poor \nthings were just old. Between you and me, now, I had planted \nthem mysdf and seen the first leaf appearing on them myself. \nThen. turning towards the front door, I said: 'Who's that? \nWho's that decrepit old person? The door's the proper \nplace for. him all right - he looks as if he's on the way out. \nWhere did you get him from? What was the attraction in \ntaking over someone dse' s dead for burial?' Whereupon the \nman said, 'Don't you recognize me? I'm Felicia. You used \nto bring me toy figures.* I'm the son of the manager Philositus, \nyour pet playm ate.' 'The man's absolutely crazy,' I said. \n'B ecome a little child again, has he, actually calls himself my \nplayma te? Well, the way he's losing his teeth at this very \nmoment, it's perfectly possible.' \nSo I owe it to this place of mine near town that my old \n* Presents which were customary during the Satumalia holidays. \nS7\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC :m, 4 \nage was made clear to me at every tum. Well, we should \ncherish old age and enjoy it. It is full of pleasure if you know \nhow to use it. Fruit tastes most delicious just when its season \nis ending. The charms of youth are at their greatest at the \ntime of its passing. It is the final glass which pleases the \ninveterate drinker, the one that sets the crowning touch on \nhis intoxication and sends him off into oblivion. Every pleasure \n-defers till its last its greatest delights. The time of life which \noffers the greatest delight is the age that sees the downward \nmovement - not the steep decline - already begun ; and in my \nopinion even the age that stands on the brink has pleasures \nof its own - or dse the very fact of not experiencing the want \nof any pleasures takes their place. How nice it is to have out­\nworn one's desires and left them behind! \n'I t's not very pleasant, though,' you may ,say, 'to have \ndeath right bef ore one's eyes.' To this I would say, firstly, \nthat death ought to be right there before the eyes of a young \nman just as much as an old one - the order in which we each \nreceive our summ ons is not determined by our precedence \nin the register - and, secondly, that no one is so very old that \nit would be quite unnatural for him to hope for one more \nday . . . . * \nEvery day, therefore, should be regulated as if it were the \none that brings up the rear, the one that rounds out and com­\npletes our lives. Pacuvius, the man who acquired a right to \nSyria by prescription, 53 was in the habit of conducting a \nmemorial ceremony for himself with wine and funeral \nfeasting of the kind we are familiar with, and then being carried \non a bier from the ·dinner table to his bed, while a chanting \nto music went on of the words 'H e has lived, he has lived ' in \nGreek, amid the applause of the young libertines present. \nNever a day passed but he celebrated his own funeral. What \n*A short, obr... -ure digression (§§6 to 7) concerning divisions of time \nis omitted.\n\f\nXD, II LETTER XII \nhe did from discreditable motives we should do from honour­\nable ones, saying in all joyfulness and cheerfulness as we \nretire to our beds. \nI have lived; I have completed now the course \nThat fortune long ago allotted me.* \nIf God adds the morrow we should accept it joyfully. The \nman who looks for the morrow without worrying over it \nknows a peaceful independence and a happiness beyond, all \nothers. Whoever has said 'I have lived • receives a windf all \nevery day he gets up in the morning. \nBut I must close this letter now.

    "raw_text": "XV, I \nLETTER XV \nOuR ancestors had a custom, observed right down as far as \nmy own lifetime, of adding to the opening words of a \nletter: 'I trust this finds you as it leaves me, in good health.' \nWe have good reason to say: 'I trust this fmds you in pursuit \nof wisdom.' For this is precisely what is meant by good health. \nWithout wisdom the mind is sick, and the body itself, how­\never physically powerful, can only have the kind of strength \nthat is found in persons in a demented or delirious state. So \nthis is the sort of healthiness you must make your principal \nconcern. You must attend to the other sort as well, but see \nthat it takes second place. It won't cost you any great trouble \nif good health is all you want. For it is silly, my dear Lucilius; \nand no way for an educated man to behave, to spend one's \ntime exercising the biceps, broadening the neck and shoulders \nand d.!vdoping the lungs. Even when the extra feeding has \nproduced gratifying results and you've put on a lot of muscle, \nyou'll never match the strength or the weight of a prize ox. \nThe greater load, moreover, on the body is crushing to the \nspirit and renders it less active. So keep the body within \nbounds as much as you can and make room for the spirit. \nDevotees of physical culture have to put up with a lot of \nnuisances. There are the exercises, in the first place, the toil \ninvolved in which drains the vitality and renders it unfit for \nconcentration or the more demanding sort of studies. Next \nthere is the heavy feeding,_ which dulls mental acuteness. \nThen there is the taking on as coaches of the worst brand of \nslave, persons who divide their time between putting on \nlotion and putting down liquor, whose idea of a well spent \nday consists of getting up a good sweat and then replacing \nthe fluid lost with plenty of drink, all the better to be absorbed \n6o\n\f\nXV,? LETTER XV \non a dry stomach. Drinking and perspiring- it's the lif e of a \ndyspeptic! There are short and simple exercises which will \ntire ·t he body without undue delay and save what needs \nespecially close accounting for, time. There is running, \nswinging weights about and jumping - either high-jumping \nor long-jumping or the kind indulged in by the priests of \nMars, if one may so describe it, or to be rather more dis­\nrespectful, by the laundress. Pick out any of these for ease and \nstraightforwardness. But whatever you do, return from \nbody to mind very soon. Exercise it day and night. Only a \nmoderate amount of work is needed for it to thrive and \ndevelop. It is a form of exercise to which cold and heat and \neven old age are no obstacle. Cultivate an asset which the \npassing of time itself improves. \nI'm not telling you to be always bent over book or writing­\ntablets. The mind has to be given some time off, but in such a \nway that it may be refreshed, not relaxed till it goes to pieces. \nTravelling in one's carriage shakes the body up and doesn't \ninterf ere with intellectual pursuits; you can read, dictate, \nspeak, or listen - nor does walking, for that matter, preclude \nany of these activities. Nor need you look down on voice­\ntraining, though I will not have you practising any of this \nascending and then descending again by degrees through set \nscales - if you start that, you'll be going on to take lessons in \nwalking !

See, this day's my last ­\nor maybe it isn't, but it's not so far away from it. \nLETTER XVI \nIT is clear to you, I know, Lucilius, that no one can lead a \nhappy life, or even one that is bearable, without the pursuit \nof wisdom, and that the perfection of wisdom is what makes \nthe happy life, although even the beginnings of wisdom make \nlife bearable. Yet this conviction, clear as it is, needs to be \nstrengthened and given deeper roots through daily reflection; \nmaking noble reso lutions is not as important as keeping the \nresolutions you have made already. You have to persevere \nand fortify your pertinacity until the will to good becomes a \ndisposition to good.

I \nrealize the feelings that prompt you to put these things in \nyour letter, and there is no pretence or speciousness about \nthem.

Its concern is \nnot with words, but with facts. It is not carried on with the \nobject of passing the day in an enter taining sort of way and \ntaking the boredom out of leisure. It moulds and builds the \npersonality, orders one's life, regulates one's conduct, shows \none what one should do and what one should leave undone, \nsits at the helm and keeps one on the correct course as one is \ntossed about in perilous seas. Without it no one can lead a \nlife free of fear or worry. Every hour of the day countless \nsituations arise that call for advice, and for that advice we \nhave to look to philosophy. \nSomeone may say : 'What help can philosophy be to me if \nthere is such a thing as fate? What help can philosophy be if \nthere is a deity controlling all ? What help can it be if all is \ngoverned by chance ? For it is impossible either to change \nwhat is already determined or to make preparations to meet \nwhat is undet ermined; either, in the first case, my planning \nis forestalled by a God who decrees how I am to act, or, in \nthe second case, it is fortune that allows me no freedom to \nplan.' Whichever of these alternatives, Lucilius, is true - even \nif all of them are true - we still need to practise philosophy. \nWhether we are caught in the grasp of an inexorable law of \nfate, whether it is God who as lord of the universe has ordered \nall things, or whether the affairs of mankind are tossed and \nbuffeted haphazardly by chance, it is philosophy that has the \nduty of protecting us. She will encourage us to submit to \nGod with cheerfuln ess and to fortune with defiance ; she will \nshow you how to follow God and bear what chance may send \nyou.

But take credit on one \naccount, that you will be doing it of your own free choice -\nand fmding it no more difficult to endure on a permanent \nbasis than to try out once in a while. We should be practising \nwith a dumm y target, getting to be at home with poverty so \nthat fortune cannot catch us unprepared. We shall be easier \nin our minds when rich if we have come to realize h�w far \nfrom burdensome it is to· be poor. The great hedonist teacher \nEpicurus used to observe certain periods during which he \nwould be niggardly in satisfying his hunger, with the object \nof seeing to what extent, if at all, one thereby fell short of \nattaining full and complete pleasure, and whether it was worth \ngoing to much trouble to make the deficit good. At least so \nhe says in the letter he wrote to Polyaenus in the year Charinus \nwas in office. He boasts in it indeed that he is managing to \nfeed himself for less than a halfpenny whereas Metrodorus, \nnot yet having made such good progress, needs a whole half­\npenny! Do you think such fare can do no more than fill a \nperson up? It can f ill him with pleasure as well, and not the \nkind of insubstantial, fleeting pleasure that needs constant \nrenewal but a pleasure which is sure and lasting. Barley \nporridge, or a crust of barley bread, and water do not make a \nvery cheerful diet, but nothing gives one keener pleasure than \nthe ability to derive pleasure even from that - and the feeling \nof having arrived at something which one cannot be deprived \nof by any unjust stroke of fortune. Prison rations are more \ngenerous : the man in the condemned cell is not so scantily \nfed as that by the executioner ; to reduce oneself, then, of \n68\n\f\nxvm, I S LETTER XVIII \none's own free choice to a diet that no man has any real call \nto be apprehensive about even if he is sentenced to death, \nthat is an act of real spiritual greatness. To do this is truly to \nforestall the blows of fortune. So, my dear Lucilius, start \nfollowing these men's practice and appoint certain days on \nwhich to give up everything and make yourself at home with \nnext to nothing. Start cultivating a relationship with poverty. \nDear guest, be bold enough to pay no heed \nTo riches, and so make yourself, like him. \nWorthy of a god.* \nFor no one is worthy of a god unless he has paid no heed to \nriches. I am not, mind you, against your possessing them, but \nI want to ensure that you possess them without tremors; and \nthis you will only achieve in one way, by convincing your­\nself that you can live a happy life even without them, and by \nalways regarding them as being on the point of vanishing. \nBut it's time I started folding up this letter. 'Not till you've \nsettled your account,' you say. Well, I'll refer you to Epicurus \nfor payment. 'Anger carried to excess begets madness.' How \ntrue this is you're bound to know, having had both slaves and \nenemies. It is a passion, though, which flares up against all \ntypes of people. It is born of love as wdl as hate, and is as \nliable to arise in the course of sport or jesting as in affairs of a \nserious kind. The factor that counts is not the importance of the \ncause from which it springs but the kind of personality it \nlands in, in the same way as with fire what matters is not the \nfierceness of the flame but where it catches - solid objects \nmay resist the fiercest flame while, conversdy, dry and in­\nflamma ble matter will nurse a mere spark into a coDfl.agra­\ntion. It is true, my dear Lucilius. The outcome of violent \nanger is a mental raving, and therefore anger is to be avoided \nnot for the sake of moderation but for the sake of sanity. \n* Virgil, Aeneid, Vlll: 364-s. \n69\n\f\nXXVI, I \nLETTER XX VI \nIT' s only a short time since I was telling you I was in sight of \nold age. Now I'm af raid I may have lef t pld age behind me \naltogether. Some other term would be more in keeping now \nwith my years, or at least my present physical state, since old \nage connotes a period of decline, not debility. Put me in the \nlist of the decrepit, the ones on the very brink ! However, I \ncongratulate myself , mind you, on the fa ct that my age has \nnot, so fa r as I'm aware, brought any deterioration in my \nspirit, conscious as I am of the deterioration in my constitution. \nOnly my vices and their accessories have decayed : the spirit \nis fu ll of lif e, and delighted to be having only limited dealings \nwith the body. It has thrown off a great part of its burden. \nIt's fu ll of vigour, and carrying on an argument with me on \nthe subject of old age, maintaining that these are its finest \nyears. Let's accept what it says, and let it make the most of \nits blessings. It tells me to start thinking and examine how far \nI owe this serenity and sobriety to philosophy, and how fa r I \nowe it simply to my years, and to investigate with some care \nwhat things I really am ref using to do and what I'm simply \nincapable of doing - and it's prepared to accept whatever I'm \nreally pleased to find myself incapable of doing as equivalent \nto ref using to do them ; and what cause can there be fo r \ncomplaint, af ter all, in anything that was always bound to \ncome to an end fading gradually away? What is troubling \nabout that?' Nothing,' you may say, 'c ould be more troubling \nthan the idea of our wasting and perishing away - melting \nout of existence, one may aptly call it, since we aren't struck \ndown all of a sudden but worn away, every day , that passes \ndiminishing in some degree our powers.'

You may \nassume that I won't be announcing the source I intend \nborrowing fr om - you know whose fu nds I'm drawing on ! \nGive me a fraction more time and payment will be made \nout of my own pocket. In the meantime Epicurus will \noblige me, with the fo llowing saying : 'Rehearse death', or -\nthe idea may come across to us rather more satisf actorily if \nput in this fo rm - 'It is a very good thing to fam iliarize one­\nself with death_.' You may possibly think it unnecessary to \nlearn something which you will only have to put into \npractice once. That is the very reason why we ought to be \npractising it. We must needs continually study a thing if we \nare not in a position to test whether we know it. 'Rehearse \ndeath.' To say this is to tell a person to rehearse his fr eedom. A \nperson who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be \na slave. He is above, or at any rate beyond the reach of, all \npolitical powers. What are prisons, warders, bars to him? He \nhas an open door. There is but one chain holding us in \nfe tters, and that is our love of lif e.

Of this one thing make sure against your \ndying day - that your fa ults die bef ore you do. Have done \nwith those unsettled pleasures, which cost one dear - they do \none harm after they're past and gone, not merely when they're \nin prospect. Even when they're over, pleasures of a depraved \nnature are apt to carry fe elings of dissatisfaction, in the same \nway as a criminal's anxiety doesn't end with the commission \nof the crime, even if it's undetected at the time. Such pleasures \nare insubstantial and unreliable; even if they don't do one \nany harm, they're fleeting in character. Look around fo r \nsome enduring good instead. And nothing answers this \ndescription except what the spirit discovers fo r itself within \nitsel£ A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, \ncarefree happiness. Even if some obstacle to this comes on the \nscene, its appearance is only to be compared to that of clouds \nwhich drift in front of the sun without ever def eating its \nlight.' \nHow soon will you be fo rtunate enough to attain to this \nhappiness? Well, you haven't been dragging your steps up \ntill now, but your pace could be increased. There's a lot of \nwork remaining to be done, and if you want to be successful \nyou must devote all your waking hours and all your eff orts \nto the task personally. This is not something that admits of \nddegation. It is a diff erent branch of learning which has room \nfor devilling. There was a rich man called Calvisius Sabinus, in \nmy own lif etime, who had a fr eedman's brains along with a \nfreedman's fo rtune. I have never seen greater vulgarity iD. a \nsuccessfu l man . His memory was so bad that at one moment \n73\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC xxvn, S \nor another the names of Ulysses, or Achilles, or Priam, \ncharacters he knew as well as we knew our early teachers, \nwould slip his memory. No doddering butler ever went \nthrough the introductions of a mass of callers committing \nquite such solecisms - not announcing people's names so \nmuch as foisting names on them - as Sabinus did with the \nGreek and Tro jan heroes. But this didn't stop him wanting to \nappear a well-read man . And to this end he thought up the \nfollowing short cut : he spent an enormous amount of \nmoney on slaves, one of them to know Homer by heart, \nanother to know Hesiod, while he assigned one apiece to \neach of the nine lyric poets. * That the cost was enormous is \nhardly surprising : not having found what he wanted in the \nmarket he had them made to order. Af ter this collection of \nslaves had been procured for him, he began to give his \ndinn er guests nightmares. He would have these fellows at \nhis elbow so that he could continually be turning to them for \nquotations fr om these poets which he might repeat to the \ncompany, and then - it happened fr equently - he would \nbreak down halfway through a word. Satellius Quadratus, \nwho regarded stupid millionaires as fair game to be sponged \noff, and consequently also fair game for flattery, as well as -\nand this goes with the other two things - fair game for \nfacetiousness at their expense, suggested to him that he \nshould keep a team of scholars 'to pick up the bits'. On \nSabinus' letting it be known that the slaves had set him back \na hundred thousand sesterces apiece, he said: 'Yes, for less \nthan that you could have bought the same number of book­\ncases.' Sabinus was none the less quite convinced that what \nanyone in his household knew he knew personal ly. It was \nSatellius, again, who started urging Sabinus, a pale and skinny \nindividual whose health was poor, to take up wrestling. \n* Alcaeus, Sappho, Stesichorus, lbycus, Bacchylides, Simonides, \nAleman, Anacreon, Pindar. \n74\n\f\nxxvm, :z LETTER XXVIII \nWhen Sabinus retorted: 'H ow can I p� �sibly do that? It's \nas much as I can do to stay alive', Satellius answered: 'N ow \nplease, don't say that ! Look how many slaves you've got in \nperfect physical condition!' A sound mind can neither be \nbought nor borrowed. And if it were for sale, I doubt \nwhether it would fmd a buyer. And yet unsound ones are \nbeing purchased every day. \nBut let me pay you what I owe you and say goodbye. \n'Poverty brought into accord with the law of nature is \nwealth.' Epicurus is constantly saying this in one way or an­\nother. But something that can never be learnt too thoroughly \ncan never be said too often. With some people you only \nneed to point to a remedy; others need to have it rammed \ninto them. \nLETTER XXVIII \nDo you think you are the only person to have had this \nexperience? Are you really surprised, as if it were something \nunprecedented, that so long a tour and such diversity of \nscene have not enabled you to throw off this melancholy and \nthis feeling of depression? A change of character, not a change \nof air, is what you need. Though you cross the boundless \nocean, though, to use the words of our poet Virgil, \nLands and towns are left astern,* \nwhatever your destination you will be followed by your \nfailings. Here is what Socrates said to someone who was \nmaking the same complaint : 'How can you wonder your \ntravels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with \nyou? You are saddled with the very thing that drove you \naway.' How can novdty of surroundings abroad and be-\n* Aeneid, m: 72.. \n7S\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC xxvm, z \ncoming acquainted with foreign scenes or cities be of any \nhelp? All that dashing about turns out to be quite futile. And \nif you want to know why all this running away cannot help \nyou, the answer is simply this: you are running away in your \nown company. You have to lay aside the load on your spirit. \nUntil you do that, nowhere will satisfy you. Imagine your \npresent state as being like that of the prophetess whom our \nVirgil represents in a roused and excited state, largely taken \nover by a spirit not her own: \nThe Sibyl raves about as one possessed., \nIn hopes she may dislodge the mighty god \nWithin her bosom.* \nYou rush hither and thither with the idea of dislodging a \nfirmly seated weight when the very dashing about just adds \nto the trouble it causes you - like the cargo in a ship, which \ndoes not weigh her down unduly so long as it does not shift, \nbut if it rolls more to one side than the other it is liable to \ncarry the side on which it settles down into the water. What­\never you do is bad for you, the very movement in itself being \nharmful to you since you are in fact shaking up a sick man . \nOnce you have rid yourself of the affliction there, though, \nevery change of scene will become a pleasure. You may be \nbanished to the ends of the ear th, and yet in whatever out­\nlandish corner of the world you may fmd yourself stationed, \nyou will find that place, whatever it may be like, a hospitable \nhome. Where you arrive does not matter so much as what \nsort of person you are when you arrive there. We ought not, \ntherefore, to give over our hearts for good to any one part of \nthe world. We should live with the conviction : 'I wasn't \nborn for one particular corner : the whole world's my home \ncountry .' If the truth of that were clear to you, you would not \nbe surprised that the diversity of new surr oundings for which, \n* Aeneid, VI: 7�· \n76\n\f\nxxvm, IO LETTER XXVIII \nout of weariness of the old, you are constantly heading fails \nto db you any good. Whichever you first came to would have \nsatisfied you if you had bdieved you were at home in all. & \nit is, instead of travelling you are rambling and drifting, \nexchanging one place for another when the thing you are \nlooking for, the good life, is available everywhere. \nCould there be a scene of greater turmoil than the City? Yet \neven there, if need be, you are free to lead a life of peace. \nGiven a fr ee choice of posting, though, I should flee a long \nway fr om the vicin ity, let alone the sight of the City. For in \nthe same way as there are unpleasant climates which are \ntrying even to the most robwt constitutions, there are others \nwhich are none too wholesome for the mind, even though it \nbe a sound one, when it is still in an imperf ect state and \nbuilding up its strength. I 'do not agree with those who \nrecommend a stormy life and plunge straight into the \nbreakers, waging a spirited struggle against wordly obstacles \nevery day of their lives. The wise man will put up with \nthese thin gs, not go out of his way to meet them ; he will \nprefer a state of peace to a state of war. It does not profit a \nman much to have managed to discard his own failings if he \nmust ever be at loggerheads with other people's. 'S ocrates,' \nthey will tell you, 'had the Thirty Tyrants standing over him \nand yet they could not break his spirit.' What difference does \nit make how many masters a man has? Slavery is only one, \nand yet the person who ref uses to let the thought of it affect \nhim is a fr ee man no matter how great the swarm of masters \naround him. \nIt is time I left off- not before I have paid the usual duty, \nthough ! 'A consciousness of wrongdoing . is the first step to \nsalvation.' This remark of Epicurus' is to me a very good one. \nFor a person who is not aware that he is doing anything \nwrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch your­\nsdf doing it before you can ref orm. Some people boast about \n77\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC xxvm, 10 \ntheir failings : can you imagine someone who counts his faults \nas merits ever giving thought to their cure? So - to the best \nof your ability - demonstrate your own guilt, conduct in­\nquiries of your own into all the evidence against yoursel£ \nPlay the part first of prosecutor, then of judge and £inally of \npleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times. \nLETTER XX XI II \nYou feel that my present letters should be like my earlier \nones and have odd sayings of leading Stoics appended to \nthem. But they never busied themselves with philosophical \ngems. Their whole system is too virile for that. When things \nstand out and attract attention in a work you can be sure \nthere is an uneven quality about it. One tree by itself never \ncalls for admiration when the whole forest rises to the same \nheight. Poetry is replete with such things; so is history. So \nplease don't think them peculiar to Epicurus; they are general, \nand ours more than anyone's, although they receive more \nnotice in him because they occur at widely scattered intervals, \nbecause they are unlooked for, and because it is rather a \nsurprise to fmd spirited sayings in a person who - so most \npeople consider - was an advocate of sof t living. In my own \nview, Epicurus was actually, in spite of his long sleeves, a \nman of spirit as well. Courage, energy and a warlike spirit \nare as commonly given to Persians as to people with a style \nof dress more suited to action. \nSo there's no call for you to press for stock excerpts, seeing \nthat the sort of thing which in the case of other thinkers is \nexcerpted is in our case continuous writing. That's why we \ndon't go in for that business of window-dressing; we don't \nmislead the customer, so that when he enters the shop he \n78"

Among Epicureans whatever Hermarchus or \nMetrodorus says is credited to one man alone ; everything \never said by any member of that fraternity was uttered under \nthe authority and auspices of one person.

I have no doubt, too, they may be very \nhelpful to the uninitiated and those who are still novices, for \nindividual aphorisms in a small compass, rounded off in \nunits rather like lines of verse, become fixed more readily in \nthe mind. It is for this reason that we give children proverbs \nand what the Greeks call chriae* to learn by heart, a child's \nmind being able to take these in at a stage when anything \nmore would be beyond its capacity. But in the case of a \ngrown man who has made incontestable progress it is di5-\ngraceful to go hunting after gems of wisdom, and prop him­\nself up with a minute number of the best-known sayings, \nand be dependent on his memory as well ; it is time he was \nstanding on his own feet. He should be delivering himself of \nsuch sayings, not memorizing them. It is disgraceful that a \nman who is old or in sight of old age should have a wisdom \nderiving solely from his notebook. 'Z eno said this.' And what \nhave you said? 'Cleanthes said that.' What have you said? \nHow much longer are you going to serve under others' \norders? Assume authority yourself and utter something that \nmay be handed down to posterity. Produce something from \nyour own resources. \nThis is why I look on people like this as a spiritless lot -\nthe people who are forever acting as interpreters and never as \ncreators, always lurking in someone else's shadow. They never \nventure to do for themselves the things they have spent such a \nlong time learning. They exercise their memories on things \nthat are not their own. It is one thing, however, to remember, \nanother to know. To remember is to safeguard something \nentrusted to your memory, whereas to know, by contrast, \nis actually to make each item your own, and not to be depen­\ndent on some original and be constantly looking to see what \nthe master said.

Not when it is just acting in a kind \nof secretarial capacity, making itself an instrument for what \nothers have to say. \nA further point, too, is that these people who never attain \nindependence follow the views of their predecessors, ftrst, \nin matters in which everyone else without exception has \nabandoned the older authority concerned, and secondly, in \nmatters in which investigations are still not complete. But no \nnew fmdings will ever be made if we rest content with the \nfindings of the past. Besides, a man who follows someone \ndse not only does not fmd anything, he is not even looking. \n'But surdy you are going to walk in your predecessors' \nfootsteps?'

There has yet to be a monopoly of \ntruth. And there is plenty ofit left for future generations too. \nLETTER XX XVIII \nYou are quite right in urging that we should exchange \nletters oftener. The utmost benefit comes from talk because \nit steals little by little into the mind. Lectures prepared before­\nhand and delivered before a listening audience are more re­\nsounding but less intimate. Philosophy is good advice, and \nno one gives advice at the top of his voice.

But \n81\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC xxxvm, I \nwhen the object is not to make him want to learn but to get \nhim learning, one must have recoune to these lower tones, \nwhich enter the mind more easily and stick in it. What is \nrequired is not a lot of words but eff ectual ones. \nWords need to be sown like see d. No matter how tiny a \nseed may be, when it lands in the right sort of ground it \nunfolds its strength and from being minute expands and grows \nto a massive size. Reason does the same ; to the outward eye \nits dimensions may be insignificant, but with activity it \nstarts devdop ing. Although the words spoken are fe w, if the \nmind has taken them in as it should they gather strength and \nshoot upwards. Yes, precepts have the same fea tures as seeds: \nthey are of compact dimensions and they produce impress ive \nresults - given, as I say, the right sort of mind, to grasp at \nand assimilate them. The mind will then respond by being in \nits tum creative and will produce a yield exceeding what was \nput into it. \nLETTER XL \nTHANK you for writing so often. By doing so you give me a \nglimpse of yourself in the only way you can. I never get a \nletter from you without instantly feeling we're toget her. If \npictures of absent friends are a source of pleasure to us, re­\nfreshing the memory and relieving the sense of void with a \nsolace however insubstantial and unreal, how much more so \nare letters, which carry marks and signs of the absent friend \nthat are real.

I do \nnot approve of this in a philosopher, whose delivery - like \nhis life - should be well-ordered; nothing can be well-regu­\nlated if it is done in a breakneck hurry. That is why in Homer \nthe impetuous type of eloquence which he compares to snow \nthat keeps on coming down without a break, is given to the \norator, while from the old man there comes a gentle elo­\nquence that 'flowed sweeter than honey '.* You Should take \nthe view, then, that this copious and impetuous energy in a \nspeaker is better suited to a hawker than to someone who \ndeals with a subject of serious importance and is also a teacher. \nYet I am just as much against his words coming in a trickle \nas in a stream. He should not keep people's ears on the \nstretch any more than he should swamp them. For the other \nextreme of thinness and poverty means less attentiveness on \nthe part of the listener as he becomes tired of this slowness \nwith all its interruptions. Nonetheless what is waited for \ndoes sink in more readily than what goes flying past; one \nspeaks in any event of instruction as being handed on to \nthose being taught, and something that escapes them is \nhardly being handed on. \nLanguage, moreover, which devotes its attention to truth \nought to be plain and unadorned. This popular style has \nnothing to do with truth. Its object is to sway a mass audience, \nto carry away unpractised ears by the force of its onslaught. \nIt never submits itself to detailed discussion, is just wafted \naway. Besides, how can a thing possibly govern others when \nit cannot be governed itself? And apart from all this surely \nlanguage which is directed to the healing of men's minds \nneeds to penetrate into one? Medicines do no good unless \nthey stop some length of time in one. There is, moreover, a \ngreat deal of futility and emptiness about this style of speak-\n* fliod, m: 22.2 and I: 249. \n83\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC n. s \ning, which has more noise about it than effectiveness. There are \nmy terrors to be quieted, incitements to be quelled, illusions \nto be dispdled, extravagance to be checked, greed to be \nreprimanded: which of these things can be done in a hurry? \nWhat doctor can heal patients merely in passing? One might \nadd, too, that there is not even any pleasure to be found in \nsuch a noisy promiscuous torrent ·of words. Just as with a lot \nof things that one would never believe possible one finds it \nquite enough to have seen them once proved possible, so \nwith these performers with words, to have heard them once \nis more than enough. What is there in them, after all, that \nanyone could want to learn or imitate? What view is one \nlikely to take of the state of a person's mind when his speech \nis wild and incoherent and knows no restraint? \nThis rapidity of utterance recalls a person running down a \nslope and unable to stop where he meant to, being carried on \ninstead a lot farther than he intended, at the mercy of his body's \nmomentum; it is out of control, and unbecoming to philo­\nsophy, which should be placing her words, not throwing \nthem around, and moving forward step by step. 'But surely \nshe can move on to a higher plane now and then as well?' \nCertainly, but it must be without prejudice to her dignity of \ncharacter, and this vehement, excessive energy strips her of \nthat. Power she shoul d have, great power, but it should be \ncontrolled: she should be a never-failing stream, not a spate. \nEven in an advocate I should be loth to allow such uncontrol­\nlable speed in delivery, all in an unruly rush; how could a \njudge (who is not uncommonly, too, inexperienced and un­\nqualified) be expected to keep up with it? Even on the occa­\nsions when an advocate is carried away by an ungovernable \npassion or a desire to display his powers, he should not in­\ncrease his pace and pile on the words beyond the capacity of \nthe ear. \nYou will be doing the right thing, therefore, if you do not \n84\n\f\nXL, 13 LETTER XL \ngo to listen to people who are more concerned about the \nquantity than the quality of what they say, and choose your­\nself - if you have to - to speak in the mann er of Publius \nVinicius. When Asellius was asked how Vinicius spoke, he \ndescribed it as being_ 'a t a slow pace'. Geminus Varius in \nfact remarked, 'H ow you can call the man eloquent I simply \ndon't know -h e can't string three words together.' Is there \nany reason why of the two you should not choose Vinicius' \nstyle? You can expect to be interrupted by persons with as \nlittle taste as the one who, when Vinicius was jerking the \nwords out one by one, as if he were dictating rather than \nspeaking, exclaimed, 'I call on the speaker to speak.' The \npace of Quintus Hat�rius, a celebrated speaker of his day, is \nsomething I should have a sensible man keep well clear of: \nwith him there was never a hesitation or a pause, only one \nstart and only one stop. \nBut I also think that certain styles are suitable in a greater \nor lesser degree to different nationalities. In a Greek one will \ntolerate this lack of discipline, while we have acquired the \nhabit of punctuating what we say, in writing as well as \nspeech. Our own Cicero, too, from whom Roman oratory \nreally sprang, was a steady goer. Roman discourse is more \ngiven to self-examination, appraising itself and inviting \nappraisal. Fabianus, who added outstanding oratory to those \nmore important distinctions of his, his way of life and his \nlearning, would discuss a subject with dispatch rather than \nwith haste. You might describe his oratory as being not \nrapid but fluent. This I am ready to see in a philosopher, but \nI do not insist on it; his delivery is not to be halting, but I \nshould rather have the words issued forth than flowing forth. \nAnd a further reason I have for warning you against that \ndisease is the fact that you can only acquire it successfully if \nyou cease to feel any sense of shame. You really need to give \nthe skin of your face a good rub and then not listen to your-\n85"

You \ncannot, I repeat, successfully acquire it and preserve your \nmodesty at the same time. One needs, moreover, constant \ndaily practice for it. It requires a switch of attention, too, from \nsubject-matter to words. And even if it does transpire that \nthe words come readily to the tongue and are capable of reel­\ning off it without any effort on your part, they will still need \nto be regulated. A way of speaking which is restrained, not \nbold, suits a wise man in the same way as an unassuming sort \nof walk does. The upshot, then, of what I have to say is this: \nI am telling you to be a slow-speaking person. \nLETTER XLI \nYou are doing the finest possible thing and acting in your \nbest interests if, as you say in your letter, you are persevering \nin your efforts to acquire a sound understanding. This is \nsomething it is foolish to pray for when you can win it \n&om your own sel£ There is no need to raise our hands to \nheaven; there is no need to implore the temple warden to \nallow us close to the ear of some _graven image, as though \nthis increased the chances of our being heard. God is near \nyou, is with you, is inside you. Yes, Lucilius, there resides \nwithin us a divine spirit, which guards us and watches us in \nthe evil and the good we do. As we treat him, so will he \ntreat us. No man, indeed, is good without God - is any one \ncapable of rising above fortune unless he has help from God? \nHe it is that prompts us to noble and exalted endeavours. In \neach and every good man \nA god (what god we are uncertain) dwells.* \n* Virgil, Aeneid, Vill ,: 3 52.. \n86\n\f\nLETTER XLI \nIf you have ever come on a dense wood of ancient trees \nthat have risen to an exceptional height, shutting out all \nsight of the sky with one thick screen of branches upon \nanother, the loftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, \nyour sense of wonderment at fmding so deep and unbroken \na gloom out of doors, will persuade you of the presence of a \ndeity. Any cave in which the rocks have been eroded deep \ninto the mountain resting on it, its hollowing out into a \ncavern of impressive extent not produced by the labours of \nmen but the result of processes of nature, will strike into your \nsoul some kind of inkling of the divine. We venerate the \nsources of important streams; places where a mighty river \nbursts suddenly from hiding are provided with altars; hot \nsprings are objects of worship; the darkness or unfathomable \ndepth of pools has made their waters sacred. And if you come \nacross a man who is never alarmed by dangers, never affected \nby cravings, happy in adversity, calm in the midst of storm, \nviewing mankind from a higher level and the gods from their \nown, is it not likely that a feeling will fmd its way into you of \nveneration for him? Is it not likely that you will say to your­\nself, 'Here is a thing which is too great, too sublime for any­\none to regard it as being in the same sort of category as that \npuny body it inhabits.' Into that body there has descended a \ndivine power. The soul that is elevated and well regulated, \nthat passes through any experience as if it counted for com­\nparatively little, that smiles at all the things we fear or pray \nfor, is impelled by a force that comes from heaven. A thing \nof that soul's height cannot stand without the prop of a \ndeity. Hence tJ:te greater part ofit is situated where it descends \nfrom; in the same way as the sun's rays touch the earth but \nare really situated at the point from which they emanate, a \nsoul possessed of greatness and holiness, which has been sent \ndown into this world in order that we may gain a nearer \nknowledge of the divine, associates with us, certainly, but \n87\n\f\nLETTER S FROM A STOIC XLI, 5 \nnever loses contact with its source. On that source it depends ; \nthat is the direction in which its eyes turn, and the direction \nit strives to climb in; the manner in which it takes part in \nour aff airs is that of a superior being. \nWhat, then, is this soul ? Something which has a lustre \nthat is due to no quality other than its own. Could anything \nbe more stupid than to praise a person fo r something that is \nnot his? Or more crazy than admiring things which in a \nsingle moment can be transf erred to another? It is not a \ngolden bit that makes one horse superior to others. Sending a \nlion into the arena with his mane gilded, tired by the handling \nhe has been given in the process of being fo rced to submit to \nthis embellishment, is a very diff erent thing fr om sending in a \nwild one with his spirit unbroken. Bold in attack, as nature \nmeant him to be, in all his unkempt beauty, a beast whose \nglory it is that none can look on him without fea r, he stands \nhigher in people's eyes than the other, docile, gold-leaf \ncoated creature. \nNo one should fe el pride in anything that is not his own. \nWe praise a vine if it loads its branches with fr uit and bends \nits very props to the ground with the weight it carries: would \nany one pref er the fa mous vine that had gold grapes and \nleaves hanging on it? Fruitf ulness is the vine's peculiar virtue. \nSo, too, in a man praise is due only to what is his very own. \nSuppose he has a beautif ul home and a handsome collection \nof servants, a lot of land under cultivation and a lot of money \nout at interest ; not one of these things can be said to be in \nhim - they are just things around him. Praise in him what can \nneither be given nor snatched away, what is peculiarly a \n• \nmans. \nYou ask what that is? It is his spirit, and the perf ection of \nbis reason in that spirit. For man is a rational animal. Man's \nideal state is realized when he has fu lfil led the purpose fo r \nwhich he was born. And what is it that reason demands of \n88\n\f\nXLV1, 2 LETTER XLVI \nhim? Something very easy - that he live in accordance with \nhis own nature. Yet this is turned into something difficult \nby the madness that is universal among men ; we push one \nanother into vices. And how can people be called back to \nspiritual well-being when no one is trying to hold them back \nand the crowd is urging them on? \nLETTER XLVI \nTHE book you promised me has come. I was intending to \nread it at my convenience and I opened it on arrival without \nmeaning to do any more than just get an idea of its co ntents. \nThe next thing I kn:ew the book itself had charmed me into \na deeper reading of it there and then. How lucid its style is \nyou may gather from the fact that I found the work light \nreading, although a first glance might well convey the \nimpression that the writer was someone like Livy or Epicurus, \nits bulk being rather unlike you or me ! It was so enjoyable, \nthough, that I found myself held and drawn on until I \nended up having read it right through to the end without a \nbreak.· All the time the sunshine was inviting me out, hunger \nprompting me to eat, the weather threatening to break, but I \ngulped it all down in one sitting. \nIt was a joy, not just a pleasure, to read it. There was so \nmuch talent and spirit about it - I'd have said 'forcefuln ess', \ntoo, if it had been written on a quieter plane now and then and \nperiodically raised on to a higher one ; as it was there was no \nsuch forcefulness, but instead there was a sustained evenness \nof style.

And all this time the poor slaves are \nforbidden to move their lips to speak, let alone to eat. The \nslightest murmur is checked with a stick; not even accidental \nsounds like a cough, or a sneeze, or a hiccup are let off a \nbeating. All night long they go on standing about, dumb \nand hungry, paying grievously for any interruption. \nThe result is that slaves who cannot talk before his face \ntalk about him behind his back. The slayes of former days, \nhowever, whose mouths were not sealed up like this, who \nwere able to make conversation not only in the presence of \ntheir master but actually with him, were ready to bare their \nnecks to the executioner for him, to divert on to themselves \nany danger that threatened him ; they talked at dinner but \nunder torture they kept their mouths shut. It is just this high­\nhanded treatment which is responsible for the frequently \nheard saying, 'You've as many enemies as you've slaves.' \nThey are not our enemies when we acquire them ; we make \nthem so. \nFor the moment I pass over other instances of our harsh \nand inhuman behaviour, the way we abuse them as if they \nwere beasts of burden instead of human beings, the way for \nexample, from the time we take our places on the dinner \ncouches, one of them mops up the spittle and another stationed \nat the foot of the couch collects up the 'leavings' of the \ndrunken diners.

His sleepless night is \ndivided between his master's drunkenness and sexual pleasures, \nboy at the table, man in the bedroom. Another, who has the \nprivilege of rating each guest's character, has to go on stand­\ning where he is, poor fellow, and watch to see whose powers \nof flattery and absence of restraint in appetite or speech are to \nsecure them an invitation for the following day. Add to these \nthe caterers with their highly developed knowledge of their \nmaster's palate, the men who know the flavours that will \nsharpen his appetite, know what will appeal to his eyes, \nwhat novelties can tempt his stomach when it is becoming \nqueasy, what dishes he will push aside with the eventual \ncoming of sheer satiety, what he will have a craving for on \nthat particular day. \nThese are the people with whom a master cannot tolerate \nthe thought of taking his dinner, assuming that to sit down at \nthe same table with one of his slaves would seriously impair \nhis dignity. 'The very idea !' he says. Yet have a look at the \nnumber of masters he has from the ranks of these very slaves.* \nTake Callistus' one-time master. I saw him once actually \nstanding waiting at Callistus' door and refused admission \nwhile others were going inside, the very master who had \nattached a price-ticket to the man and put him up for sale \nalong with other rejects from his household staff. There's a \nslave who has paid his master back - one who was pushed \ninto the fl.rst lot, too, the batch on which the auctioneer is \nmerely trying out his voice ! Now it was the slave's turn to \nstrike his master off his list, to decide that he's not the sort of \n* Many ex-slaves had risen to high positions wtder Claudiw and \nNero. \n92\n\f\nXLVD, 14 LETTER XL VII \nperson he wants in his house. Callistus' master sold him, yes, \nand look how much it cost him! \nHow about reflecting that the person you call your slave \ntraces his origin back to the same stock as yourself, has the \nsame good sky above him, breathes as you do, lives as you do, \ndies as you do? It is as easy for you to see in him a free-hom \nman as for him to see a slave in you. Remember the Varus \ndisaster: many a man of the most distinguished ancestry, \nwho was doing his military service as the first step on the \nroad to a seat in the Senate, was brought low by fortune, \ncondemned by her to look after a steading, for example, or a \nflock of sheep. Now think contemptuously of these people's \nlot in life, in whose very place, for all your contempt, you \ncould suddenly find yoursel£ \nI don't want to involve myself in an endless topic of \ndebate by discussing the treatment of slaves, towards whom \nwe Romans are exceptionally arrogant, harsh and insulting. \nBut the essence of the advice I'd like to give is this: treat \nyour inferiors in the way in which you would like to be \ntreated by your own superiors. And whenever it strikes you \nhow much power you have over your slave, let it also strike \nyou that your own master has just as much power over you. \n'I ha ' ' Y ' �1:. ' ven t got a master, you say. ou re young yet; were s \nalways the chance that you'll have .one. Have you forgotten \nthe age at which Hecuba became a slave, or Croesus, or the \nmother ofDarius, or Plato, or Diogenes? Be kind and courte­\nous in your dealings with a slave; bring him into your dis­\ncussions and conversatioQS and your company generally. \nAnd if at this point all those people who have been spoilt \nby luxury raise an outcry protesting, as they will, 'There \ncouldn't be anything more degrading, anything more dis­\ngraceful', let me just say that these are the very persons I will \ncatch on occasion kissing the hand of someone else's slave. \nDon't you notice, too, how our ancestors took away all \n93\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC XLW, I4 \nodium from the master's position and all that seemed insult­\ning or degrading in the lot of the slave by calling the master \n'father of the household' and speaking of the slaves as \n'members of the household ' (something which survives to \nthis day in the mime) ? They instituted, too, a holiday on \nwhich .tna.Ster and slave were to eat together, not as the only \nday this could happen, of course, but as one on which it was \nalways to happen. And in the household they allowed the \nslaves to hold official positions and to exercise some jurisdic­\ntion in it ; in fact they regarded the household as a miniature \nrepublic. \n'Do you mean to say,' comes the retort, 'that I'm to have \neach and every one of my slaves sitting at the table with me?' \nNot at all, any more than you're to invite to it everybody who \nisn't a slave. You're quite mistaken, though, if you imagine \nthat I'd bar from the table certain slaves on the grounds of the \nrelatively menial or dirty nature of their work- that muleteer, \nfor example, or that cowhand. I propose to value them accord­\ning to their character, not their jobs. Each man has a character \nof his own choosing; it is chance or fate that decides his choice \nof job. Have some of them dine with you because they deserve \nit, others in order to make them so deserving. For if there's \nanything typical of the slave about them as a result of the low \ncompany they're used to living in, it will be rubbed off through \nassociation with men ofbetter breeding. \nYou needn't, my dear Lucilius, look for friends only in the \nCity or the Senate; if you keep your eyes open, you'll fmd \nthem in your own home. Good material often lies idle for \nwant of someqp.e to make use of it; just give it a trial. A man \nwho examines the saddle and bridle and not the animal itself \nwhen he is out to buy a horse is a fool; similarly, only an \nabsolute fool values a man according to his clothes, or accord­\ning to his social position, which after all is only something \nthat we wear like clothing. \n94"

For one person \n'man' is equivalent to 'friend', for another 'man' and \n'friend' are far from being identified, and in making a friend \none man will be seeking an asset while another will be making \nhimself an asset to the othe:r; and in the midst of all this what \nyou people do for me is pull words about and cut up syllables. \nOne is led to believe that unl ess one has constructed syllogisms \nof the craftiest kind, and reduced fallacies to a compact form \nin which a false conclusion is derived from a true premise, \none will not be in a position to distinguish what one should \naim at and what one should avoid. It· makes one ashamed -\nthat men of our advanced years should turn a thing as serious \nas this into a game. \n'Mouse is a syllable, and a mouse nibbles cheese; therefore, \na syllable nibbles cheese.' Suppose for the moment I can't \ndetect the f allacy in that. What danger am I placed in by such \nlack of insight? What serious consequences are there in it for \nme? What I have to fear, no doubt, is the possibility, one of \nthese days, of my catching a syllable in a mousetrap or even \nhaving my cheese eaten up by a book if I'm not careful. \nUnless perhaps the following train of logic is a more acute \none: 'M ouse is a sylla ble, and a syllable does not nibble cheese; \ntherefore, a mouse does not nibble cheese.' What childish \n97\n\f\nLBTTBRS FROM A STOIC xt vm, 7 \nfatuities these are ! Is this what we philosophers acquire \nwrinkles in our brows for? Is this what we let our beards \ngrow long for? Is this what we teach with faces grave and \npale? \nShall I tell you what philosophy holds out to humanity? \nCounsel. One person is facmg death, another is vexed by \npoverty, while another is tormented by wealth - whether \nhis own or someone else's; one man is appalled by his mis­\nfortunes while another longs to get away fiom his own \nprosperity; one man is suffering at the hands of men, another \nat the hands of the gods. What's the point of concocting whim­\nsies for me of the sort I've just been mentioning? This isn't \nthe place for fun - you're called in to help the unhappy. \nYou're pledged to bring succour to the shipwrecked, to those \nin captivity, to the sick, the needy and men w�o are just \nplacing their heads beneath the executioner's uplifted axe. \nWhere are you off to?

Tell \nthem how simple are the laws she has laid down, and how \nstraightforward and enjoyable life is for those who follow \nthem and how confused and disagreeable it is for others who \nput more trust in popular ideas than they do in nature.

The sea was quite calm when we cast \noff. The sky was certainly heavily overcast, with the kind of \ndark clouds that generally break in a squall or downpour. \nBut in spite of the uncertain, threatening skies, I thought it \nwould be perf ectly fe asible to make it across the fe w miles \nfrom your Parthenope over to Puteoli. And so, with the \nobject of getting the crossing over quicker, I headed straight \nfo r Nesis over the_ open water to cut out all the intervening \ncurves of the coast-line. Now when I had got so far across \nthat it made no odds whether. I went on or turned back, first \nof all the smoothness which had tempted me to my undoing \ndisappeared. There was no storm as yet, but a heavy swell \nwas running by then and the waves were steadily getting \nrougher. I began asking the helmsman to put me ashore some­\nwhere. He kept saying the coast was a rugged one without a \nhaven anywhere and that there was nothing he fe ared quite \nso much in a storm as a lee shore. I was in far too bad a way, \nthough, fo r any thought of possible danger to enter my head, \nas I was suff ering the torments of that sluggish brand of \nseasickness that will not bring one relief , the kind that upsets \nthe stomach without clearing it. So I put pressure on him and \ncompelled him, willy- nilly, to make fo r the shore. Once we \n100\n\f\nLID, 6 LBTTBR LIII \nwere dose in there was no waiting on my part for anything \nto be done in the mann er commended by Virgil, \nBows faced seawards \nor \nAnchor cast from bow.* \nRemembering my training as a long-standing devotee of \ncold baths, I dived into the sea in just the way a cold-water \naddict ought to - in my woolly clothes. You can imagine \nwhat I suffered as I crawled out over the rocks, as I searched \nfor a route to safety or fought my way there. It made me \nrealize how right sailors are in being afraid of a lee shore. \nWhat I endured, in my inability to endure my then self, is \nbeyond beli ef. You can take it from me that the reason \nUlysses got himself wrecked everywhere was not so much \nbecause Neptune was against him from the day he was born, \nbut because he was given to seasickness like me - it'll take me \ntwenty years to reach my destination, too, if I ever have to \njourney anywhere by sea ! \nAs soon as I'd settled my stomach (f or stomachs, as you \nknow, aren't clear of seasickness the moment they're clear of \nthe sea) and rubbed myself over with embrocation to put \nsome life back into my body, I began to reRect how we are \nattended by an appalling forgetfulness of our weaknesses, \neven the physical ones which are continually bringing them­\nselves to our notice, and much more so with those that are \nnot only more serious but correspondingly less apparent. A \nslight feverishness may deceive a person, but when it has \ndeveloped to the point where a genuine fever is raging it will \nextract an admission that something is wrong from even a \ntough and hardened individual . Suppose our feet ache, with \nlittle needling pains in the joints : at this stage we pass it off \nand say we've sprained an ankle or strained something in \n*A eneid, Vl:3, ffi:277. \nIOI\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC tm,6 \nsome exercise or other ; while the disorder is in its indeter­\nminate, commencing phas�. its name dudes us, but once it \nstarts bending the feet in just the way an ankle-rack does and \nmakes them both misshapen, we· have to confess that we've \ngot the gout. \nWith affiictions of the. spirit, though, the opposite is the \ncase: the worse a person is, the less he feels it. You needn't \nfeel surprised, my dearest Lucilius; a person sleeping lightly \nperceives impressions in his dreams and is sometimes, even, \naware during sleep that he is asleep, whereas a heavy slumber \nblots out even dreams and plunges the mind too deep for \nconsciousness of sel£ Why does no one admit his failings? \nBecause he's still deep in them. It's the person who's awakened \nwho recounts his dream, and acknowledging one's failings is \na sign of health. So let us rouse ourselves, so that we may be \nable to demonstrate our errors. But only philosophy will \nwake us; only philosophy will shake us out of that heavy \nsleep. Devote yourself entirely to her. You're worthy of her, \nshe's worthy of you - fall into each other's arms. Say a firm, \nplain no to every other occupation. There's no excuse for \nyour pursuing philosophy merely in moments when occasion \nallows. If you were sick you would take a rest from attending \nto your personal affairs and drop your practice in the courts. \nAnd during a spell of improvement in your condition you \nwouldn't look on any client as being so important that you'd \nundertake his case in court; No, you'd devote your entire \nattention to recovering from your illness in the quickest \npossible time. Well, then, aren't you going to do the same in \nthese circumstances? Away with every obstacle and leave \nyourself free to acquire a sound mind - no one ever attains \nthis if he's busy with other things. Philosophy wields an \nauthority of her own ; she doesn't just accept time, she grants \none it.

When some state or other off ered Alexander a part of \nits territory and half of all its property he told them that 'he \nhadn't come to Asia with the intention of accepting whatever \nthey cared to give him, but of letting them keep whatever \nhe chose to leave them.' Philosophy, likewise, tells all other \noccupations: 'It's not my intention to accept whatever time \nis lef t over fr om you; you shall have, instead, what I reject.' \nGive your whole mind to her.

'What kind \nof ill health?' you'll be asking. And well you may, fo r there \n103\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC UV, I \niSn't a single kind I haven't experienced. There's one particular \nailment, though, for which I've always been singled out, so \nto speak. I see no reason why I should call it by its Greek \nname,* difficulty in breathing being a perfectly good way of \ndescribing it. Its onslaught is of very brief duration - like a \nsquall, it is generally over within the hour. One could hardly, \nafter all, expect anyone to keep on drawing his last breath for \nlong, could one? I've been viSited by all the troublesome or \ndangerous complaints there are, and none of them, in my \nopinion, iS more unpleasant than this one - which iS hardly \nsurprising, iS it, when you consider that with anything else \nyou're merely ill, while with this you're constantly at your \nlast gasp? This iS why doctors have nicknamed it 'rehearsing \ndeath', since sooner ·or later the breath does just what it has \nbeen trying to do all those times. Do you imagine that as I \nwrite this I must be feeling in high spirits at having escaped \nthis time? No, it would be just as absurd for me to feel over­\njoyed at its being over - as if this meant I was a healthy man \nagain - as it would· be for a person to think he has won hiS \ncase on obtaining an extension of time bef ore trial. \nEven as I fought for breath, though, I never ceased to find \ncomfort in cheerful and courageous reflections. 'What's this?' \nI said. 'S o death is having all these tries at me, is he? Let him, \nthen! I had a try at him a long while ago mysel£' 'When was \nthis?' you'll say. Before I was born. Death iS just not being. \nWhat that is like I know already. It will be the same after me \nas it was before me. If there is any torment in the later state, \nthere must also have been torment in the period before we \nsaw the light of day; yet we never felt conscious of any dis­\ntress then. I ask you, wouldn't you say that anyone who took \nthe view that a lamp was worse off when it was put out than \nit was before it was lit was an utter idiot? We, too, are lit and \nput out. We suffer somewhat in the intervening period, but \n* i.e. its medical name, asthmtL \n104\n\f\nLV, I LETTER LV \nat either end of it there is a deep tranquillity. For, unless I'm \nmistaken, we are wrong, my dear Lucilius, in holding that \ndeath follows after, when in fact it precedes as well as suc­\nceeds. Death is all that was before us. What does it matter, \nafter all, whether you cease to be or never begin, when the \nresult of either is that you do not exist? \nI kept on talking to myself in these and similar terms -\nsilently, needless to say, words being out of the question. \nThen little by little the affiiction in my breathing, which was \ncoming to be little more than a panting now, came on at \nlonger intervals and slackened away. It has lasted on, all the \nsame, and in spite of the passing of this attack, my breathing \nis not yet coming naturally. I feel a sort of catch and hesitation \nin it Let it do as it pleases, though, so long as the sighs aren't \nheartfelt. You can feel assured on my score of this: I shall \nnot be afraid when the last hour comes - I'm already prepared, \nnot planning as much as a day ahead. The man, though, whom \nyou should admire and imitate is the one who finds it a joy to \nlive and in spite of that is not reluctant to die. For where's \nthe virtue in going out when you're really being thrown out? \nAnd yet there is this virtue about my case: I'm in the process \nof being thrown out, certainly, but the manner of it is as if I \nwere going out. And the reason why it never happens to a \nwise man is that being thrown out signifies expulsion from a \nplace one is reluctant to depart from, and there is nothing \nthe wise man does reluctantly. He escapes necessity because \nhe wills what necessity is going to force on him. \nLETTER LV \nI'VE just this moment returned from a ride in my sedan­\nchair' feeling as tired as if r d walked the whole distance \ninstead of being seated all the way. Even to be carried for \nlOS\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LV, I \nany length of time is hard work, and all the more so, I dare \nsay, because it is unnatural, nature having given us legs with \nwhich to do our own walking, just as she gave us eyes with \nwhich todo ourownseeing. Sof tli vingimposesonusthepenalty \nof debility; we cease to be able to do the things we've long been \ngrudging about doing. However, I was needing to give my \nbody a shaking up, either to dislodge some phlegm, perhaps, \nthat had collected in my throat, or to have some thickness, \ndue to one cause or· another, in my actual breathing reduced \nby the motion, which I've noticed before has done me some \ngood. So I deliberately continued the ride fo r quite a -long \nway, with the beach itself tempting me onwards. It sweeps \nround between Cumae and Servilius Varia's country house \nin a sort of narrow causeway with the sea on one side and a \nlagoon on the other. A recent storm had lef t it firm; fo r, as \nyou know, a fa st-running heavy surf makes a beach flat and \nsmooth, while a longish period of calm weather leads to a \ndisintegration of this surf ace with the disappearance of the \nmoisture that binds the particles of sand together. \nI had started looking around me in my usual way to see \nwhether I could find anything I could turn to good account, \nwhen my eyes turned to the house which had once belonged \nto Vatia. This was the place where Varia passed the latter \npart of his lif e, a wealthy man who had held the office of \npraetor but was fa med fo r nothing but his lif e of retirement, \nand considered a fo rtunate ·man on that ground alone. For \nwhenever a man was ruined through being a fr iend of Asinius \nGallus or an enemy of Sejanus, or devoted to Sejanus (f or \nit came to be as dangerous to have been a fo llower of his as it \nwas to cross him), people used to exclaim,_ 'Vatia, you're the \nonly person who knows how to live ! • What in fa ct he knew \nwas how to hide rather than how to live. And there is a lot of \ndiff erence between your lif e being a retiring one and its being \na spineless one. I never used to pass this house while Vatia \nIo6\n\f\nLV, 7 LBTTBR LV \nwas alive without saying, 'Here lieth Varia.' But philosophy, \nmy dear Lucilius, is such a holy thing and inspires so much \nrespect, that even something that resembles it has a specious \nappeal. Let a man retire and the common crowd will think \nof him as leading a life apart, free of all cares, self-contented, \nliving for himself, when in fact not one of these bl essings \ncan be won by anyone other than the philosopher. He alone \nknows how to live for himself: he is the one, in fact, who \nknows the fundamental thing, how to live. The person who \nhas run away from the world and his fellow-men, whose \nexile is due to the unsuccessful outcome of his own desires, \nwho is unable to endure the sight of others more fortunate, \nwho has taken to some place of hiding in his alarm like a \ntimid, inert animal, he is not 'li ving for himself', but for his \nbelly and his sleep and his passions - in utter degradation, in \nother words. The fact that a person is living for nobody does \nnot automatically mean that he is living for hirnsel£ Still, a \npersevering steadfastness of purpose counts for a lot, so that \neven inertia if stubbornly maintained may carry a certain \nweight. \nI can't give you any accurate information about the house \nitsel£ I only know the front of it and the parts in view, the \nparts that it displays even to passers-by. There are two arti­\nficial grottoes, considerable feats of engineering, each as big \nas the most spacious hall, one of them not letting in the sun \nat all, the other retaining it right up until its setting. There is \na grove of plane trees through the middle of which runs a \nstream flowing altematdy, like a tide-race, into the sea and \ninto the Acherusian . Lake, a stream capable of supporting a \nstock of fish even if constantly exploited; it is left alone, though, \nwhen the sea is open: only when bad weather gives the \nfishermen a holiday do they lay hands on this ready supply. \nBut the most advantageous feature of the house is that it has \nBaiae next door; it enjoys all the amenities of that resort and \n10']\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC LV, 7 \nis free from its disadvantages. I can speak fo r these attractions \nfrom personal knowledge, and I am quite prepared to believe, \ntoo, that it is an all-the-year-round house, since it lies in the \npath of the western breeze, catching it to such an extent as to \nexclude Baiae from the benefit of it. Vatia see ms to have been \nno foo l in choosing this place as the one in which he would \nspend his retirement, sluggish and senile as that retirement \nhad become. \nThe place one's in, though, doesn't make any contribution \nto peace of mind: it's the spirit that makes everything agree­\nable to onesel£ I've seen fo r myself people sunk in gloom \nin cheerful and delightful country houses, and people in \ncompletely secluded surroundings who looked as if they \nwere run off their fe et. So there's no reason why you should \nfe el that you're not· as m!Jch at rest in your mind as you \nmight be just because you're not here in Campania. Why \naren't you, fo r that matter? Transmit your thoughts all the \nway here. There's nothing to stop you enjoying the company \nof absent friends, as of ten as you like, too, and fo r as long as \nyou like. This pleasure in their company - and there's no \ngreater pleasure - is one we enjoy the more when we're \nabsent from one another. For having our friends present \nmakes us spoil t; as a result of our talking and walking and \nsitting together every now and then, on being separated we \nhaven't a thought fo r those we've just been seeing. One good \nreason, too, why we should endure the absence patiently is \nthe fa ct that every one of us is absent to a great extent from \nhis friends even when they are around. Count up in this \nconnexion first the nights spent away fr om one another, then \nthe diff erent engagements that keep each one busy, then the \ntime passed in the privacy of one's study and in trips into the \ncountry, and you'll see that periods abroad don't deprive us \nof so very .much. Possession of a fr iend should be with the \nspirit: the spirit's never absent: it sees d.a.i.ly whoever it \nloS\n\f\nLVI, 2 LETTER LVI \nlikes. So share with me my studies, my meals, my walks. \nLife would be restricted indeed if there were any barrier to \nour imaginations. I see you, my dear Lucilius, I hear you at \nthis very moment. I feel so very much with you that I wonder \nwhether I shouldn't start writing you notes rather than letters! \nLETTER LVI \nI CANNOT for the life of me see that quiet is as necessary to a \nperson who has shut himself away to do some studying as it is \nusually thought to be. Here am I with a babel of noise going \non all about me. I have lodgings right over a public bath­\nhouse. Now imagine to yourself every kind of sound that \ncan make one weary of one's years. When the strenuous \ntypes are doing their exercises, swinging weight-laden hands \nabout, I hear the grunting as they toil away - or go through \nthe motions of toiling away - at them, and the hissings and \nstrident gasps every time they expel their pent up breath. \nWhen my attention turns to a less active fellow who is con­\ntenting himself with an ordinary inexpensive massage, I hear \nthe smack of a hand pummelling his shoulders, the sound \nvarying according as it comes down flat or cupped. But if \non top of this some ball player comes along and starts shout­\ning out the score, that's the end ! Then add someone starting \nup a brawl, and someone else caught thieving, and the man \nwho likes the sound of his voice in the bath, and the people \nwho leap into the pool with a tremendous splash. Apart &om \nthose whose voices are, if nothing else, natural, think of the \nhair remover, continually giving vent to his shrill and pene­\ntrating cry in order to advertise his presence, never silent \nunless it be while he is plucking someone' s armpits and making \nthe client yell for him ! Then think of the various cries of the \n109\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC LVI, 2. \nman selling drinks, and the one selling sausages and the other \nselling pastries, and all the ones hawking for the catering shops, \neach publicizing his wares with a distinctive cry of his own. \n'You must be made of iron,' you may say, 'or else hard of \nhearing if your mind is unaffected by all this babel of dis­\ncordant noises around you, when continual \"good morning\" \ngreetings were enough to finish off the Stoic Chrysippus !' \nBut I swear I no more notice all this roar of noise than I do \nthe sound of waves or falling water - even if I am here told \nthe story of a people on the Nile who moved their capital \nsolely because they could not stand the thundering of a \ncataract ! Voices, I think, are more inclined to distract one \nthan general noise ; noise merely fills one's ears, battering \naway at them while voices actually catch one's attention. \nAmong the things which create a racket all around me without \ndistracting me at all I include the carriages hurrying by in the \nstreet, the carpenter who works in the same block, a man in \nthe neighbourhood who saws, and this fellow tuning horns \nand flutes at the Trickling Fountain and emitting blasts in­\nstead of music. I still fmd an intermittent noise more irritating \nthan a continuous one. But by now I have so steeled myself \nagainst all these things that I can even put up with a coxswain's \nstrident tones as he gives his oarsmen the rhythm. For I \nforce my mind to become self-absorbed and not let outside \nthings distract it. There can be absolute bedlam without so \nlong as there is no commotion within, so long as fear and \ndesire are not at loggerheads, so long as meanness and ex­\ntravagance are not at odds and harassing each other. For what \nis the good of having silence throughout the neighbourhood \nif one's emotions are in turmbil ? \nThe peaceful stillness of the night had lulled \nThe world to rest.* \n*A fragment of Varro Atacinus' translation from the Greek of \nApollonius' Argotu�Utica. \nIIO\n\f\nLVI, 9 LETTER LVI \nThis is incorrect. There is no such thing as 'peaceful stillness ' \nexcept where reason has lulled it to rest. Night does not \nremove our worries ; it brings them to the surface. All it \ngives us is a change of anxieties. For even when people are \nasleep they have dreams as troubled as their days. The only \ntrue serenity is the one which represents the free development \nof a sound mind. Look at the man whose quest for sleep \ndemands absolute quiet from his spacious house. To prevent \nany sound disturbing his ears every one of his host of slaves \npreserves total silence and those who come anywhere near \nhim walk on tip-toe. Naturally enough he tosses from side to \nside, trying to snatch some fitful sleep in between the spells \nof fretting, and complains of having heard sounds when he \nnever heard them at all. And what do you suppose is the \nreas on? His mind is in a ferment. It is this which needs to be \nset at peace. Here is the mutiny that needs to be suppressed. \nThe fact that the body is lying down is no reason for suppos­\ning that the mind is at-peace. Rest is sometimes far from rest­\nful. Hence our need to be stimulated into general activity and \nkept occupied and busy with pursuits of the right nature \nwhenever we are victims of the sort of idlen ess that wearies \nof itsel£ When great military commanders notice indiscipline \namong their men they suppress it by giving them some work \nto do, mounting expeditions to keep them actively employed. \nPeople who are really busy never have enough time to become \nskittish. And there is nothing so certain as the fact that the \nharmful consequences of inactivity are dissipated by activity. \nWe commonly give the impress ion that the reasons for \nour having gone into political retirement are our disgust with \npublic life and our dissatisf action with some uncongenial and \nunrewarding post. Yet every now and then ambition rears \nits head again in the retreat into which we were really driven \nby our apprehensions and our waning interest ; for our \nambition did not cease because it had been rooted out, but \nIll\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC Lvt, 9 \nmerely because it had tired - or become piqued, perhaps, at \nits lack of success. I would say the same about extravagant \nliving, which appears on occasion to have lef t one and then, \nwhen one has declared fo r the simple lif e, places temptation \nin the way. In the middle of one's programme of fr ugality it \nsets out af ter pleasures which one had discarded but not con­\ndemned, its pursuit of them indeed being all the more ardent \nthe less one is aware of it. For when they are in the open \nvices invariably take a more moderate fo rm; diseases too are \non the way towards being cured when once they have broken \nout, instead of being latent, and made their presence fe lt. So \nit is with the love of money, the love of power and the other \nmaladies that aff ect the minds of men - you may be sure that \nit is when they abate and give every appearance of being \ncured that they are at their most dangerous. We give the im­\npression of being in retirement, and are nothing of the kind. \nFor if we are genuine in this, if we have sounded the retreat \nand really turned away from the surf ace show, then, as I \nwas saying a little while ago, nothing will . distract us. Men \nand birds together in full chorus will never break into our \nthinking when that thinking is good and has at last come to \nbe of a sure and steady character. . \nThe temperament that starts at the sound of a voice or \nchance noises in general is an unstable one and one that has \nyet to attain inward detachment. It has an element of uneasi­\nness in it, and an element of the rooted fe ar that makes a \nman a prey to anxiety, as in the description given by our Virgil : \nAnd I, who formerly would never flinch \nAt flying spears or serried ranks of Greeks, \nAm now alarmed by every breeze and roused \nBy every sound to nervousness, in fear \nFor this companion and this load alike.* \n* Aeneid, n: 72�. Aeneas is describing his feelings as he leads his \nson and carries his father out ofTroy while the city is being sacked. \nII2\n\f\nLXID, I LBTTBR LXIII \nThe earlier character here is the wise man, who knows no \nfear at the hurtling of missiles, or the clash of weapons against \nweapons iD. the close-packed ranks, or the thunderous noise \nof a city in destruction. The other, later one has everything \nto learn ; fearing for his belongings he pales at every noise; \na single cry, whatever it is, prostrates him, being immediatcly \ntaken for the yelling of the enemy; the slightest movement \nfrightens him out ofhis life ; his baggage makes him a coward. \nPick out any one of your 'successful' men, with all they \ntrail or carry about with them, and you will have a picture of \nthe man 'in fear for this companion and this load '. You may \nbe sure, then, that you are at last 'l ulled to rest ' when noise \nnever reaches you and when voices never shake you out of \nyourself, whether they be menacing or inviting or just a \nmeaningless hubbub of empty sound all round you. \n'This is all very well,' you may say, 'but isn't it sometimes \na lot simpler just to keep away from the din?' I concede that, \nand in fact it is the reason why I shall shortly be moving \nelsewhere. What I wanted was to give myself a test and some \npractice. Why should I need to suffer the torture any longer \nthan I want to when Ulysses found so easy a remedy for his \ncompanions even against the Sirens?* \nLETTER LXIII \nI AM very sorry to hear of your friend Flaccus' death. Still, \nI would not have you grieve unduly over it. I can scarcely \nventure to demand that you should not grieve at all - and yet \nI am convinced that it is better that way.

Even he will feel a \ntwinge of pain when a thing like this happens - but only a \ntwinge. As for us, we can be pardoned for having given way \nto tears so long as they have not run down in excessive \nquantities and we have checked them for ourselves. When \none has lost a friend one's eyes should be neither dry nor \nstreaming. Tears, yes, there should be, but not lamentation. \nCan you find the rule I am laying down a harsh one when the \ngreatest of Greek poets has restricted to a single day, no more, \na person's right to cry- in the passage where he tells us that \neven Niobe remembered to eat?* Would you like to know \nwhat lies behind extravagant weeping and wailing? In our \ntears we are trying to fmd mearis of proving that we feel the \nloss. We are not being governed by our grief but parading it. \nNo one ever goes into mourning for the benefit merely of \nhimsel£ Oh, the miserable folly of it all - that there should be \nan element of ostentation in grief! \n'Come now,' you will be asking, 'are you saying that I \nshould forget a person who has been a friend?' Well, you \nare not proposing to keep him very long in your memory if \nhis memory is to last just as long as your grie£ At any moment \nsomething or other will happen that will tum that long face \nof yours into a smiling one. I do not see very much time going \nby before the sense of loss is mitigated and even the keenest \nsorrowings settle down.

Nobody really cares to cast his \nmind back to something which he is never going to think of \n* Homer, fliad, XIX:2. 2.8f., XXIV: 6o1£\n\f\nLXm, 10 LETTER LXIII \nwithout pain. Inevitable as it is that the names of persons who \nwere dear to us and are now lost should cause us a gnawing \nsort of pain when we think of them, that pain is not without \na pleasure of its own. As my teacher Attalus used to say, 'In \nthe pleasure we find in the memory of departed friends there \nis a resemblance to the way in which certain bitter fruits are \nagreeable or the very acidity of an exceedingly old wine has \nits attraction. But after a certain interval all that pained us is \nobliterated and the enjoyment comes to us unalloyed.' If we \nare to believ� him, 'Thinking of friends who are alive and \nwell is like feasting on cakes and honey. Recalling those who \nare gone is pleasant but not without a touch of sourness. Who \nwould deny, though, that even acid things like this with a \nharshness in their taste do stimulate the palate?' Personally I \ndo not agree with him there. Thinking of departed friends is \nto me something sweet and mellow. For when I had them \nwith me it was with the feeling that I was going to lose them, \nand now that I have lost them I keep the feeling that I have \nthem with me still. \nSo, my dear Lucilius, behave in keeping with your usual \nfair-mindedness and stop misinterpreting the kindness of \nfortune. She has given as well as taken away. Let us therefore \ngo all out to make the most of friends, since no one can tell \nhow long we shall have the opportunity. Let us just think \nhow often we leave them behind when we are setting out on \nsome long journey or other, or how often we fail to see them \nwhen we are staying in the same area, and we shall realize \nthat we have lost all too much time wl:iile they are still alive. \nCan you stand people who treat their friends with complete \nneglect and then mourn them to distraction, never caring \nabout anyone unless they have lost him? And the reason they \nlament them so extravagantly then is that they are afraid \npeople may wonder whether they did care; they are looking \nfor belated means of demonstrating their devotion. If we have \nII S\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXm, IO \nother friends, we are hardly kind or appreciative of them if \nthey coWlt for so very little when it comes to consoling w \nfor the one we have buried. If we have no other friends, we \nhave done ourselves a greater injury than fortWle has done w: \nshe has deprived w of a single friend but· we have deprived \nourselves of every friend we have failed to make. A person, \nmoreover, who has not been able to care about more than \none friend cannot have cared even about that one too much. \nSupposing someone lost his one and only shirt in a robbery, \nwould you not think him an utter idiot if he chose to bewail \nhis loss rather than look about him for some means of keep­\ning out the cold and fmd something to put over his shoulders? \nYou have buried someone you loved. Now look for someone \nto love. It is better to make good the loss of a friend than to \ncry over him. \nWhat I am about to go on to say is, I know, a common­\nplace, but I am not going to omit it merely because every one \nhas said it. Even a person who has not deliberately put an \nend to his grief fmds an end to it in the passing of time. And \nmerely growing weary of sorrowing is quite shameful as a \nmeans of curing sorrow in the case of an enlightened man. I \nshould prefer to see you abandoning grief than it abandoning \nyou. Much as you may wish to, you will not be able to keep it \nup for very long, so give it up as early as possible. For women \nour forefathers fixed the period of mourning at a year with \nthe intention, not that women should continue mourning as \nlong as that, but that they should not go on any longer: for \nmen no period is prescribed at all because none would be \ndecent. Yet out of all the pathetic females you know of who \nwere only dragged away from the graveside, or even torn \nfrom the body itself, with the greatest of difficulty, can you \nshow me one whose tears lasted for a whole month?

Nevertheless I condemn today \nthe way I behaved then. I realize now that my sorrowing in \nthe way I did was mainly due to the fact that I had never \nconsidered the possibility of his dying before me. That he \nwas younger than I was, a good deal younger too, was all \nthat ever occurred to me - as if fate paid any regard to \nseniority! So let us bear it constantly in mind that those we \nare fond of are just as liable to death as we are ourselves. \nWhat I should have said before was, 'My friend Serenus is \nyounger than I am, but what difference does that make? He \nshould die later than me, but it is quite possible he will die \nbefore me.' It was just because I did not do so that fortune \ncaught me unprepared with that sudden blow. Now I bear \nit in mind not only that all things are liable to death but that \nthat liability is governed by no set rules. Whatever can happen \nat any time can happen today. Let us reflect then, my dearest \nLuciliw, that we ourselves shall not be long in reaching the \nplace we mourn his having reached. Perhaps, too, if only \nthere is truth in the story told by sages and some welcoming \nabode awaits us, he whom we suppose to be dead and gone \nhas merely been sent on ahead. \n117\n\f\nLETTER LXV LXV, I \nI SHARED yesterday with a bout of illness. It claimed the \nmorning but it let me have the af ternoon. So I started off by \ndoing some reading to see what energy I had. Then, as it \nproved up to this, I ventured to make fu rther demands on \nit - or perhaps I should say concessions to it - and did some \nwriting. I was at this with more than my customary concen­\ntration, too, what with the diffi culty of the subject and my \nrefusal to give in, until some fr iends of mine put a stop to it, \napplying fo rce to restrain me as if I were an invalid who was \nrecklessly overdoing things. The pen gave place to talk. \nwhich included the fo llowing matter of dispute that I shall \nnow state to you. We have appointed you as �bitrator -\nand you have more of a case on your hands than you think, \nfo r the contest is a three-cornered one. \nOur Stoic philosophers, as you know, maintain that there \nare two elements in the universe from which all things are \nderived, namely cause and matter. Matter lies inert and \ninactive, a substance with unlimited potential, but destined \nto remain idle if no one sets it in motion; and it is cause (this \nmeaning the same as reason) which turns matter to whatever \nend it wishes and fa shions it into a variety of diff erent products. \nThere must, then, be something out of which things come \ninto being and something else by means of which things \ncome into being; the first is matter and the second is cause. \nNow all art is an imitation of nature. So . apply what I was \nsaying about the universe to man's handiwork. Take a statue: \nit had the matter to be worked on by the sculptor and it had \nthe sculptor to give configuration to the matter - bronze, in \nother words, in the case of the statue, being the matter and \nthe craftsman the cause. It is the same with all things: they \nII8\n\f\nLXV, 7 LETTER LXV \nconsist of something which comes into being and something \nelse which brings them into being. \nStoics believe that there is only one cause - that which \nbrings things into being. Aristotle thinks that the term 'c ause' \ncan be used in three diff erent ways. 'The first cause,' he \nsays, 'i s matter - without it nothing can be brought into \nexistence. The second is the craf tsman, and the third is fo rm, \nwhich is impressed on every single piece of work as on a \nstatue.' This last is what Aristotle calls the idos. 'And,' he says, \n'there is a fo urth as well, the purpose of the whole work.' \nLet me explain what this means. The 'fi rst cause ' of the \nstatue is the bronze, as it would never have been made unless \nthere had been something out of which it could be cast or \nmoulded. The 's econd cause ' is the sculptor, as the bronze \ncould not have been shaped into the state in which it is with­\nout those skilled hands having come to it. The 'third cause' \nis the fo rm, as our statue could not have been called 'The \nMan with the .Spear' or 'The Boy tying up his Hair'* had \nthis not been the guise impressed on it. The 'f ourth cause ' is \nthe end in view in its making, fo r had this not existed the \nstatue would never have been made at all. What is this end? \nIt is what attracted the sculptor, what his goal was in creating \nit : it may have been money, if when he worked it he was \ngoing to sell it, or fa me, if the aim of his endeavours was to \nwin a name, or religion, if it was a work fo r presentation to a \ntemple. This too, then, is a cause of the statue's coming into \nbeing - unless you take the view that things in the absence of \nwhich the statue would never have been created should not be \nincluded among the causes of the particular creation. \nTo these fo ur causes Plato adds a fifth in the model - what \nhe himself calls the idea - this being what the sculptor had \nconstantly bef ore his eyes as he executed the intended work. \n*W ell-known works of Polycletus, the great fifth century Greek \nsculptor. Copies ofboth statues have survived. \n11 9\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXV, 7 \nIt does not matter whether he has his model without, one to \nwhich he can direct his eyes, or within, conceived and set up \nby the artist inside his own head. God has within himself \nmodels like this of everything in the universe, · his mind \nembracing the designs and calculations fo r his projects; he is \nful l of these images which Plato calls ideas, eternal, immutable, \never dynamic. So though human beings may perish, humanity \nin itself- the pattern on which every human being is moulded \n- lasts on, and while human beings go through much and \npass away itself remains quite unaff ected. As Plato has it, \nthen, there are five causes: the material, the agent, the fo rm, \nthe model and the end; and finally we get the result of all \nthese. In the case of the statue, to use the example we began \nwith, the material is the bronze, the agent is the sculptor, the \nfo rm is the guise it is given, the model is what the sculptor \nmalcing it copies, the end is what the maker has in view, and \nthe final result is the statue itself . The universe as well, \naccording to Plato, has all these elements. The maker is God; \nmatter is the material; the fo rm is the general character and \nlay-out of the universe as we see it ; the model naturally \nenough is the pattern which God adopted fo r the creation of \nthis stupendous work in all its beauty; the end is what God \nhad in view when he created it, and that - in case you are \nasking. what is the end God has in view - is goodness. That at \nany rate is what Plato says: 'What was the cause of God's \ncreating the universe? He is good, and whoever is good can \nnever be grudging with anything good; so he made it as \ngood a world as it was in his power to make it.' \nNow it is fo r you as judge to pronounce your verdict \nand declare whose statement in your opinion seems to be -\nnot the truest (f or that here is as far out of our reach as Truth \nherself) - but most like the truth. \nThis assortment of causes which Aristotle and Plato have \ncollected together embraces either too much or too little. For \n120\n\f\nLXV, IS LBTTBR LXV \nif they take the view that everything in the absence of which a \nthing cannot be brought into being is a cause of its creation, \nthey have failed to name enough. They should be including \ntime in their list of causes - nothing can come into being \nwithout time. They should be including place - a thing will \ncertainly not come into being if there is nowhere for this to \nhappen. They should be including motion - without this \nnothing either comes into existence or goes out of existence; \nwithout motion there is no such thing as art and no such thing \nas change. What we are looking for at the moment is a \nprimary and general cause. And this must be something \nelementary, since matter too is elementary. If we ask what \ncause is, surely the answer is creative reason, that is to say \nGod. All those things which you have listed are not an array \nof individual causes, but dependent on a single one, the cause \nthat actually creates. You may say form is a cause, but form is \nsomething which the artist imposes on his work - a part of \nthe cause, yes, but not a cause. The model, too, is an indis­\npensable instrument of the cause, but not a cause. To the \nsculptor his model is as indispensable as his chisel or his file: \nhis art can get nowhere without them, but this does not make \nthem parts or causes of the art. 'The end the artist has in view,' \nour friend says, 'the thing which induces him to set about a \nwork of creation, is a cause.' Even if we grant that it is, it is \nonly an accessory cause, not the effective cause. Accessory \ncauses are infinite in number; what we are after is the general \ncause. In any event that assertion on the part of Plato and \nAristotle that the universe in its entirety, the whole, completed \nwork of creation, is a cause is not in keeping with their usual \nacuteness as thinkers. There is a very great difference between \na creation and its cause. \nNow you must either pronounce your verdict or - the \neasier course in matters of this nature - declare your inability \nto arrive at one and order a rehearing.

This consisted either of \nurgings (from the timid among them} that he should just \ntake whichever course he himself felt urged to take, or of \nwhatever counsel flattering admirers thought would be most \nlikely to gratify someone meditating suicide, until a Stoic \nfriend of mine, an outstanding personality for whom I can \nfind no more fitting compliment than that of calling him a \nman of fighting courage, gave what I thought was the most \ninspiring advice. This was how he began: 'My dear Marcel­\nlinus,' he said, 'you mustn't let this worry you as if you were \nhaving to make a great decision. There's nothing so very \ngreat about living - all your slaves and all the animals do it. \nWhat is, however, a great thing is to die in a manner which is \nhonourable, enlightened and courageous. Think how long \nnow you've been doing the same as them - food, sleep, sex, \nthe never-ending cycle. The desire for death can be experi­\nenced not merely by the enlightened or the brave or the un­\nhappy, but even by the squeamish.' Well, Marcellinus \nwanted no urging, only a helper. His slaves refused to obey \nhim in this, whereupon our Stoic talked away their fears, \nletting them know that the household staff could only be in \ndanger if there had been any room for doubt as to whether \ntheir master's death had been a voluntary one; besides, he \ntold them, it was just as bad to let other people see you order­\ning your master not to kill himself as actually to kill him. He \nthen suggested to Marcellinus himself that it would not be an \nunkind gesture if, in the same way as at the end of a dinner \nthe leftovers are divided among the attendants, something \n126\n\f\nLXXVD, 12 LETTER LXXVII \nwere off ered at the end of his lif e to those who had served \nthroughout it. Marcellinus had a generous and good-natured \ndisposition which was no less evident where it meant personal \nexpense, and he distributed accordingly little sums of money \namong his slaves, who were now in tears, and went out of his \nway to comf ort them all. He did not need to resort to a \nweapon or to shedding blood. Aft er going without fo od fo r \nthree days he had a steam tent put up, in his own bedroom ; a \nbath was brought in, in which he lay fo r a long time, and as \nfr esh supplies of hot water were continually poured in he \npassed almost imperceptibly away, not without, as he com­\nmented more than once, a kind of pleasurable sensation, \none that is apt to be produced by the gentle fa ding out of \nwhich those of us who have ever fain ted will have some \nexperience. \nI have digressed, but you will not have minded hearing \nthis story, since you will gather fr om it that your fr iend's \ndeparture was not a difficult or unhappy one. Although his \ndeath was self -inflicted, the mann er of his passing was \nsupremely relaxed, a mere gliding out of lif e. Yet the story \nis not without its practical value fo r the future. For frequently \nenough necessity demands just such examples. The times are \nfrequent enough when we cannot reconcile ourselves to dying, \nor to knowing that we ought to die. \nNo one is so ignorant as not to know that some day he \nmust die. Nevertheless when death draws near he turns, \nwailing and trembling, looking fo r a way out. Wouldn't you \nthink a man a prize fo ol if he burst into tears because he \ndidn't live a thousand years ago? A man is as much a fo ol fo r \nshedding tears because he isn't going to be alive a thousand \nyears fr om now. There's no diff erence between the one and \nthe other - you didn't exist and you won't exist - you've no \nconcern with either period. This is the moment you've been \npitched into - supposing you were to make it longer how \n127\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXXVD, u \nlong would you make it? What's the point of tears? What's \nthe point of praye rs? You're only wasting your breath. \nSo give up hoping that your prayers can bring \nSome change in the decisions of the gods.* \nThose decisions are ftxed and permanent, part of the mighty \nand eternal train of destiny. You will go the way that all \nthings go. What is strange about that? This is the law to \nwhich you were born; it was the lot of your fa ther, your \nmother, your ancestors and of all who came bef ore you as it \nwill be of all who come af ter you. There is no means of alter­\ning the irresistible succession of events which carries all \nthings along in its binding grip. Think of the multitudes of \npeople doomed to die that will be fo llowing you, that will be \nkeeping you company ! I imagine you'd be braver about it if \nthousands upon thowands were dying with you: the fa ct is \nthat men as well as other creatures are breathing their last in \none way or another in just such numbers at the very instant \nwhen you're unable to make your mind up about death. You \nweren't thinking, surely, that you woul dn't yourself one day \narrive at the destination towards which you've been heading \nfrom the beginning? Every journey has its end. \nHere I imagine you'll be expecting me to tell you the \nstories of examples set by heroic men? Well, I'll tell you about \nones which children have set. History rdates the story of the \nfa mous Spartan, a mere boy who, when he was taken prisoner, \nkept shouting in his native Doric, 'I shall not be a slave !' He \nwas as good as his word. The first time he was ordered to \nperform a slave's task, some humiliating household job (his \nactual orders were to fe tch a disgusting chamber pot), he \ndashed his head against a wall and cracked his skull open. \nFreedom is as near as that - is anyone really still a slave ?54 \nWould you not rather your own son died like that than lived \n* Virgil, Aeneid, V1:3 76. \nus\n\f\nLXXVII, 18 LETTER LXXVII \nby reason of spinelesm ess to an advanced age? Why be \nperturbed, then, about death when even a child can meet it \nbravely? Suppose you refuse to follow him: you will jwt be \ndragged after him. Assume the authority which at present \nlies with others. Surely you can adopt the spirited attitude of \nthat boy and say, 'No slave am I!' At present, you unhappy \ncreature, slave you are, slave to your fellow-men, slave to \ncircumstance and slave to lif e (for life itself is slavery if the \ncourage to die be absent) . \nHave you anything that might induce you to wait? You \nhave exhawted the very pleasures that tn.ake you hesitate and \nhold you back ; not one of them has any novelty for you, not \none of them now fails to bore you out of sheer excess. You \nknow what wine or honey-wine tastes like : it makes no \nd.iff'erence whether a hundred or a thousand flagons go through \nyour bladder - all you are is a strainer. You are perfectly \nfamiliar with the taste of oysters or mullet. Your luxurious \nway of life has kept back not a single fresh experience for \nyou to try in coming years. And yet these are the things from \nwhich you are reluctant to be tom away. What else is there \nwhich you would be sorry to be deprived of? Friends? Do \nyou know how to be a friend? Your country? Do you really \nvalue her so highly that you would put off your dinner for \nher? The sunli ght? If you could you would put out that light ­\nfor what have you ever done that deserved a place in it? \nConfess it - it is no attachment to the world of politics or \nbwiness, or even the world of nature, that makes you put off \ndying - the delicatess ens, in which there is nothing you have \nleft untried, are what you are reluctant to leave. You are \nscared of death - but how magnificently heedless of it you are \nwhile you are dealing with a dish of choice mushro oms ! You \nwant to live - but do you know how to live? You are scared \nof dying - and, tell me, is the kind of life you lead really any \ndi1ferent from being dead? Caligula was once ·passing a \n129\n\f\nLBTTBRS PROM A STOIC LXXVII, 18 \ncolumn of captives on the ·Latin Road when one . of them, \nwith a hoary old beard reaching down his breast, begged to be \nput to death. ' So,' replied Caligula, 'you are alive, then, as \nyou are?' That is the answer to give to people to whom death \nwould actually come as a release. 'Y ou are scared of dying? \nSo you are alive, then, as you are?' \nSomeone, though, will say, 'B ut I want to live because of \nall the worthy activities I'm engaged in. I'm performing life's \nduties conscientiously and energetically and I'm reluctant to \nleave them undone.' Come now, surely you know that dying \nis also one of lif e's duties? You're leaving no duty undone, \nfor there's no fixed number of duties laid down which you're \nsupposed to complete. Every life without exception is a \nshort one. Looked at in relation to the universe even the lives \nof Nestor and Sattia were short. In Sattia, who ordered that \nher epitaph should record that she had lived to the age of \nninety-nine, you have an example of someone actually boast­\ning of a prolonged old age - had it so happened that she had \nlasted out the hundredth year everybody, surely, would have \nfound her q�te insufferable ! As it is with a play, so it is with \nlif e - what matters is not how long the acting lasts, but how \ngood it is. It is not important at what point you stop. Stop \nwherever you will - only make sure that you round it off \nwith a good ending. \nLETTE R LXXVIII \nI AM all the more sorry to hear of the trouble you are having \nwith constant catarrh, and the spells of feverishness which go \nwith it when it becomes protracted to the point of being \nchronic, because this kind of ill health is something I have \nexperienced mysel£ In its early stages I refused to let it \n130"

Reduced to a state of complete \nemaciation, I had arrived at a pomt where the catarrhal dis­\ncharges were virtually carrying me away with them alto­\ngether. On many an occasion I felt an urge to cut my life \nshort there and then, and was only held back by the thought \nof my father, who had been the kindest of fathers to me and \nwas then in his old age. Having in mind not how bravely I \nwas capable of dying but how far from bravely he was \ncapable of bearing the loss, I conunanded myself to live. There \nare times when even to live is an act ofbravery. \nLet me tell you the things that provided me with con­\nsolation in those days, telling you to begin with that the \nthoughts which brought me this peace of mind had all the \neffect of medical treatment. Comforting thoughts (provided \nthey are not of a discreditable kind) contribute to a person's \n. cure; anything which raises his spirits benefits him physically \nas well. It was my Stoic studies that really saved me. For the \nfact that I was able to leave my bed and was restored to \nhealth I give the credit to philosophy. I owe her - and it is \nthe leasi: of my obligations to her - my life. But my friends \nalso made a considerable contribution to my return to health. \nI found a great deal of relief in their cheering remarks, in the \nhours they spent at my bedside and in their conversations \nwith me. There is nothing, my good Lucilius, quite like the \ndevotion of one's friends for supporting one in illness and \nrestoring one to health, or for dispelling one's anticipation \nand dread of death. I even came to feel that I could not really \ndie when these were the people I would leave surviving me, \nor perhaps I should say I came to think I would continue to \nlive because of them, if not among them; for it seemed to \nme that in death I would not be passing away but passing on \nmy spirit to them. These things gave me the willingn ess to \n131\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC I.XXVDI,4 \nhelp my own recovery and to endure all the pain. It is quite \npathetic, after all, if one has put the will to die behind one, to \nbe without the will to live. \nThere, then, are your remedies. The doctor will be telling \nyou how much walking you should do, how much exercise \nyou should take; he will be telling you not to overdo the \ninactivity- as is the tendency with invalids - and recommend­\ning reading aloud to exercise the breathing (its passages and \nreservoir being the areas affected); he will recommend that \nyou take a trip by sea and derive some stimulation for the \ninternal organs from the gentle motion of the boat; he will \nprescribe a diet for you, and tell you when to make use of \nwine as a restorative and when to give it up in case it starts \nyou coughing or aggravates your cough. My own advice to \nyou - and not only in the present illness but in your whole \nlife as wdl - is this: refuse to let the thought of death bother \nyou: nothing is grim when we have escaped that fear. There \nare three upsetting things about any illn ess : the fear of dying, \nthe physical suffering and the interruption of our pleasures. I \nhave said enough about the first, but will just say this, that \nthe fear is due to the facts of nature, not of illness. Dlness has \nactually given many people a new lease of lif e ; the experience \nof being near to death has been their preservation. You will \ndie not because you are sick but because you are alive. That \nend still awaits you when you have been cured. In getting well \nagain you may be escaping some ill health but not death. Now \nlet us go back and deal with the disadvantage which really \ndoes belong to illness, the fact that it involves considerable \nphysical torments. These are made bearable by their inter­\nmittency. For when pain is at its most severe the very intensity \nfinds means of ending it. Nobody can be in acute pain and feel \nit for long. Nature in her unlimited kindness to us has so \narranged things as to make pain either bearable or brief. The \nseverest pains have their seat in the most attenuated parts of \n132.\n\f\nLXXVID, II LETTER LXXVIII \n�e body; any area of slight dimensions like a tendon or a \njoint cawes excruciating agony when trouble arises within \nits small confines. But these parts of our anatomy go numb \nvery quickly, the pain itself giving rise to a loss of all sensation \nof pain (either becawe the lif e force is impaired by being held \nup in its natural circulation and so loses its active power, the \npower which enables it to give w warning of pain, or be­\ncause the diseased secretions, no longer abl e to drain away, \nbecome self -obliterated and deprive the areas they have \ncongested of sensation) . Thw gout in the feet or the hands or \nany pain in the vertebrae or tendons has intermittent lulls \nwhen it has dulled the area it is torturing; these are all cases \nin which the distress is cawed by the initial twinges and the \n'riolence of the pain disappears as time goes on, the suffering \nending in a s�te of insensibility. The reason why pain in an \neye, an ear or a tooth is exceptionally severe is the fact that it \ndevelops in a limited area, and indeed this applies jwt as \nmuch to pains in the head; nevertheless if its intensity goes \nbeyond a certain point it is turned into a state of dazed \nstupefaction. So there is the comforting thing about extremities \nof pain: if you feel it too much you are bound to stop feeling \nit. \nWhat in fact makes people who are morally unenlightened \nupset by the experience of physical distr ess is their failure to \nacquire the habit of contentment with the spirit. They have \ninstead been preoccupied by the body. That is why a man of \nnoble and enl ightened character separates body from spirit \nand has jwt as much to do with the former, the frail and \ncomplaining part of our nature, as is necessary and no more, \nand a lot to do with the better, the divine element. 'But it's \nhard having to do without pleasures we're used to, having to \ngive up food and go thirsty as well as hungry.' Tiresome it is \nin the first stages of abstinence. Later, as the organs of appetite \ndecline in strength with exhaustion, the cravings die down; \n1 33\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC LXXVIII, II \n·thereafter the stomach becomes fussy, unable to stand things \nit could never have enough of bef ore. The desires themselves \ndie away. And there is· nothing harsh about having to do \nwithout things fo r which you have ceased to have any \ncraving. \nAnother point is that every pain leaves off altogether, or at \nleast fa lls off in intensity, fr om time to time. Moreover one \ncan guard against its arr ival and employ drugs to fo rest all it \njust as it is coming on; fo r every pain (or at least every pain \nwith a habit of regular recurrence) gives one advance warning \nof its coming. In .illness the suff ering is always bearable so \nlong as you refuse to be aff ected by the ultimate threat. \nSo do not go out of your way to make your troubles \nany more tiresome than they are and burden yourself with \nfretti ng. Provided that one's thinking has not been adding \nanything to it, pain is a trivial sort of thing. If by contrast \nyou start giVing yourself encouragement, saying to yourself, \n'It's nothing - or nothing much, anyway - let's stick it out, \nit'll be over presently ', then in thinking it a trivial matter \nyou will be ensuring that it actually is. Everything hangs on \none's thinking. The love of power or money or luxurious \nliving are not the only things which are guided by popular \nthinking. We take our cue from people's thinking even in the \nway we fe el pain. \nA man is as unhappy as he has convinced hirnselfhe is. And \ncomplaining away about one's suff erings af ter they are over \n(you know the kind of language : 'N o one had ever been in \nsuch a bad state. The torments and hardships I endured! No \none thought I would recover. The number of times I was \ngiven up fo r lost by the fa mily ! The number of times I was \ndespaired of by the doctors ! A man on the rack isn't tom with \npain the way I was') is something I think should be banned. \nEven if all this is true, it is past history. What's the good of \ndragging up suff erings which are over, of being unhappy now \n134"

Besides, there is a pleasure in having suc­\nceeded in enduring something the actual enduring of which \nwas very far from pleasant ; when some trouble or other \ncomes to an end the natural thing is to be glad. There are \ntwo things, then, the recollecting of trouble in the past as \nwell as the fea r of troubles to come, that I have to root out : \nthe ftrst is no longer of any concern to me and the second has \nyet to be so. And when a man is in the grip of difficulties he \nshould say \nThere may be pleasure in the memory \nOf even these events one day.* \nHe should put his whole heart into the ftght against them. If \nhe gives way bef ore them he will lose the battle ; if he exerts \nhimself against them he will win. What in fa ct most people do \nis pull down on their own heads what they should be holding \nup against ; when something is in imminent danger of fa lling \non you, the pressure of it bearing heavily on you, it will only \nmove af ter you and become an even greater weight to sup­\nport if you back away from it ; if instead you stand your \nground, willing yourself to resist, it will be fo rced back. \nLook at the amount of punishment that boxers and wrestlers \ntake to the fa ce and the body generally ! They will put up \nnone the less with any suff ering in their desire fo r fa me, and \nwill undergo it all not merely in the course of fighting but \nin preparing fo r their fights as well : their training in itself \nconstitutes suff ering. Let us too overcome all things, with \nour reward consisting not in any wreath or garland, not in \ntrumpet-calls fo r silence fo r the ceremonial proclamation of \nour name, but in moral worth, in strength of spirit, in a \n* Virgil, Aeneid, I: 203. \nI3S\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC ·LXXVDI,I 6 \npeace that is won for ever once in any contest fortune has \nbeen utterly defeated. \n'I'm suffering severe pain,' you may say. Well does it \nstop you suffering it if you endure it in a womanish fashion? \nIn the same way as the enemy can do far more damage to \nyour army if it is in full retreat, every trouble that may come \nour way presses harder on the one who has turned tail and is \ngiving ground. 'But it's really severe.' Well, is courage only \nmeant to enable us to bear up under what is not severe? \nWould you rather have an illness that's long drawn out or \none that's short and quick? If it's a long one it will have the \nodd interval, giving one opportunity for rallying, granting \none a good deal of time &ee of it, having of necessity to \npause in order to build up again. An illness that's swift and \nshort will have one of two results : either oneself or it will be \nmuffed out. And what difference does it make whether I or \nit disappears? Either way ther e's an end to the pain. \nAnother thing which will help is to tum your mind to \nother thoughts and that way get away from your suffering. \nCall to mind things which you have done that have been \nupright or courage ous; run over in yout mind the finest \nparts that you have played. And cast your memory over the \nthings you have most admired ; this is a time for recollect­\ning all those individuals of exceptional courage who have \ntriumphed over pain : the man who steadily went on reading a \nbook while he was having varicose veins cut out : the man who \nnever stopped smiling under torture albeit that this angered \nhis tormentors into trying on him every instrument of cruelty \nthey had. If pain has been conquered by a smile will it not be \nconquered by reason? And here you may mention anything \nyou care to name, catarr h, a fit of uninterruptet coughing so \nviolent that it brings up parts of the internal organs, having \none's very entrails seared by a fever, thirst, having limbs \nwrench ed in different directions with dislocation of the joints, \n136\n\f\nLXXVDI, 22 LBTTBR LXXVIII \nor - worse than these - being stretched on the rack or burnt \n·alive, or subjected to the red-hot plates and instruments \ndesigned to re-open and deepen swelling wounds. There have \nbeen men who have undergone these experiences and never \nuttered a groan. 'He needs more, he ham' t asked for mercy \n... he needs more, he still hasn't answered ... he needs more, \nhe has actually smiled, and not a forced smile either.' Surely \npain is something you will want to smile at after this. \n'But my illness has taken me away from my duties and \nwon't allow me to achieve anything.' It is your body, not \nyour mind as well, that is in the grip of ill health. Hence it \nmay slow the feet of a runner and make the hands of a smith \nor cobbler less efficient, but if your mind is by habit of an \nactive tum you may still give instruction and advice, listen \nand learn, inquire and remember. Besides, if you meet \nsickness in a sensible mann er, do you really think you are \nachieving nothing? You will be demonstrating that even if one \ncannot always beat it one can always bear an illness. There is \nroom for heroism, I ass ure you, in bed as anywhere else. \nWar and the battle-front are not the only spheres in which \nproof is to be had of a spirited and fearless character: a \nperson's bravery is no less evident under the bed-clothes. \nThere is something it lies open to you to achieve, and that is \nmaking the fight with illness a good one. If its threats or \nimportunities leave you quite unmoved, you are setting others \na signal example. How much scope there would be for re­\nnown if whenever we were sick we had an audience of specta­\ntors! Be your own spectator anyway, your own applauding \naudience. \nPleasures, moreover, are of two kinds. The physical pleas­\nures are the ones which illness interferes with, though it does \nnot do away with them altogether - indeed, if you take a \ntrue view of the matter, they are actually sharpened by illn ess, \na man deriving greater pleasure from drinking something \n1 37\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXXVDI, u \nwhen he is thirsty and finding food all the more welcome \nthrough being hungry, anything set before one after one has \nhad to fast being greeted with a heightened appetite. But no \ndoctor can refuse his patient those other, greater and surer \npleasures, the pleasures of the mind and spirit. Anyone who \nfollows these and genuinely knows them pays no attention \nwhatever to all the enticements of the senses. 'How very \nunfortunate he is,' people say, 't o be sick like that !' Why? \nBecause he isn't melting snow in his wine? Because he isn't \nbreaking ice into a bumper goblet to keep the drink he has \nmixed in it chilled? Because Lucrine oysters aren't being \nopened before him at his table? Because there im' t any bust­\nling of cooks about the dining-room, bringing in not just \nthe viands themselves but the actual cooking apparatus along \nwith them? For this is the latest innovation in luxurious \nliving, having the kitchen accompany the dinner in to the \ntable so as to prevent any of the food losing its heat and \navoid anything being at a temperature insufficiently scalding \nfor palates which are nowadays like leather. 'How very \nunfortunate he is to be sick,' they say. In fact he'll be eating \njust as much as he'll digest. There won't be a whole boar \nlying somewhere where people can see it, conveying the \nimpression that it has been banished from the table as being \ntoo cheap and ordinary a piece of meat to be on it, nor will \nhe have his trolley piled high with - now that people think \nit not quite nice to see the whole bird - carved breast of fowL \nAnd what's so bad about your being deprived of that? You \nmay be eating like a sick man, but you'll at last be eating in \nthe way a healthy man should. \nBut given one thing we shall find it easy to put up with the \npotions and warm drinks and all the rest of it - all the things \nthat seem unbearable to people who have become spoilt, \nwho have become soft through a life of luxury, ailing more \nin the mind than they ever are in the body; the one require>-\nIJ8"

Then and then only shall we stop being \nweary of living as well as scared of dying. For a life spent \nviewing all the variety, the majesty, the sublimity in things \naround us can never succumb to enn ui : the feeling that one is \ntired of being, of existing, is usually the result of an idle and \ninactive leisure. Truth will never pall on someone who ex­\nplores the world of nature, wearied as a person will be by the \nspurious things. Moreover, even if death is on the way with a \nsumm ons for him, though it come all too early, though it \ncut him off in the prime of life, he has experienced every \nreward that the very longest life can offer, having gained \nextensive knowledge of the world we live in, having learnt \nthat time adds nothing to the finer things in lif e. Whereas \nany life must needs seem short to people who measure it in \nterms of pleasures which through their empty nature are \nincapable of completeness. \nLet these reflections promote your recovery, and meanwhile \ndo find time for our correspondence. Time will bring us \ntogether again one of these days; and when, as it will, the \nreunion comes, however short it may last, knowing how to \nmake the most of it will turn it into a long one. As Posidonius \nsaid, 'In a single day there lies open to men of learning more \nthan there ever .does to the unenlightened in the longest of \nlifetimes.' In the meantime cling tooth and nail to the follow­\ning rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, \nand always take full note of fortune's habit of behaving just \nas she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going· to do \neverything it is in her power to do. Whatever you have been \nexpecting for some time comes as less of a shock. \n· \n1 39\n\f\nLXXXIII, I \nLETTER LXXXIII \nYou demand an account of my days - generally as well as \nindividually. You think well of me if you suppose that there is \nnothing in them for me to hide. And we should, indeed, live \nas if we were in public view, and think, too, as if �omeone \ncould peer into the inmost recesses of our hearts - which \nsomeone can ! For what is to be gained if something is con­\ncealed from man when nothing is barred from God? He is \npresent in our minds, in attendance in the midst of our \nthoughts- although by 'attendance' I do not mean to suggest \nthat he is not at times absent from our thoughts. I shall do as \nyou say, then, and gladly give you a record of what I do and \nin what order. I shall put myself under observation straight \naway and undertake a review of my day - a course which is \nof the utmost benefit. What really ruins our characters is the \nfact that none of us looks back over his life. We think about \nwhat we are going to do, and only rarely of that, and fail to \nthink about what we have done, yet any plans for the future \nare dependent on the past. \nToday has been unbroken. No one has robbed me of any \npart of it. It h3:5 been wholly divided between my bed and \nmy reading. A very small part of it has been given over to \nphysical exercise - and on this account I'm grateful for old \nage, for the exercise costs me little trouble. I only have to \nstir and I'm weary, and that after all is the end of exercise \neven for the strongest. Interested in having my trainers? \nOne's enough for me - Pharius, a likeable young fellow, as \nyou know, but he's due for a change. I'm looking now for \nsomeone rather more youthful. He in fact declares that \nwe're both at the same climacteric since we're both losing \nour teeth. But I've reached the stage where I can only keep \n140\n\f\nIXXXID, 9 LBTTBR LXX: CUI \nup with him with difficulty when we're out for a run, and \nbefore many days are out I won't be able to keep up with him \nat all. See what daily exercise does for one. When two people \nare going in opposite directions there's soon a big distance \nbetween them: he's coming up at the same time as I'm going \ndownwards, and you know how much quicker travel is in \nthe second of these directions. But I'm wrong; the age I'm \nat isn' t one that is 'going downwards ' - it's one that's in \nheadlong descent. \nHowever, you'd like to hear how today's race ended? \nWell, we made it a tie, something that doesn't often happen \nwith runners. Mter this, more a spell of exhaustion than of \nexercis e, I had a cold plunge - cold, with me, meaning just \nshort of warm ! Here I am, once celebrated as a devotee of \ncold baths, regularly paying my respects to the Canal on the \nfirst of January and jumping into the Maiden Pool in just the \nsame way as I read, wrote and spoke some sentence or other \nevery New Year in order to ensure good luck in the coming \nyear; and now I've shifted my scene of operations, first to \nthe Tiber, then to my own pool here, which, even when I'm \nfeeling my heartiest and don't cheat, has had the chill taken \noff it by the sun ; it's a short step to a hot bath ! The next \nthing is breakfast, which consists of some dry bread; no \ntable laid, and no need to wash the hands af ter such a meal. I \nthen have the briefest of naps. You know this habit of mine, \nof dropping off for a moment or two, just slipping off the \nharness, as you might say. I find it enough to have simply \nstopped being awake. Sometimes I know I've been asleep, \nsometimes merely guess I have been .... * \nZeno was a very great man as well as the founder of our \nStoic school, a school with an unequalled record for cour­\nageous and saintly living; well, listen to the way in which, \n* A total of about Bs lines of this letter have been omitted as not of \ninterest or repeating thoughts expressed elsewhere. \n141\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC LXXXm, 9 \ndesiring to deter us from drunkenness, he deduces the principle \nthat the good man won't get drunk. 'N o person who -is \ndrunk,' he says, 'is entrusted with a secret: the good man is \nentrusted with a secret: therefore, the good man will not get \ndrunk.' Watch how ridiculous he's made to look when we \ncounter with a single syllogism on the same pattern (of the \nmany we could advance it's sufficient to instance one). 'N o \nperson who is asleep is entrusted with a secret : the good man \nis entrusted with a secret: therefore, the good man does not \ngo to sleep ... .' \nNow just let each of us name for himself the people he \nknows can be trusted with a secret though they can't be \ntrusted with a bottle. I'll give, all .the same, one solitary \nexample myself, just to prevent its being lost to human \nmemory! Life needs a stock of noteworthy examples; nor \nneed we always go running to antiquity for them. Lucius \nPi so was drunk from the very moment of his appointment as \nWarden of the City of Rome. He regularly spent most of the \nnight wining and dining in company, and slept from then \nuntil around midday, noon to him being early morning; he \nnevertheless discharged his duties, which embraced the \ngeneral welfare of the whole city, with the utmost efficiency. \nThe late emperor Augustus as well as Tiberius entrusted him \nwith secret orders, the former on appointing him governor \nof Thrace (the conquest of which he completed), the latter \nwhen he left Rome for Campania, leaving behind him in the \ncapital many ob jects of distrust and hostility. I imagine it was \nbecause Piso's drunken habits haq been such a success so far \nas he was concerned that Tiberius later appointed Cossus to \nbe Prefect of the City. This man, otherwise dignified and self­\ncontrolled, steeped himself in liquor, soaking it up to such an \nextent that on one occasion in the Senate, having come there \nstraight from a party, he succumbed to a slumber from which \nnothing could rouse him and had to be carried out. Yet this \n142\n\f\nLXXXD1,2 4 IB'f.TBR IXXXIII \ndid not stop Tiberius writing (in his own hand) a number of \nletters to Cossus the contents of which he did not consider \nsuitable fo r communication even to his ministers; and Cossus \nnever let slip a single secret, whether private or official .. •• \nIf you want to arrive at the conclusion that the good man \nought not to get drunk, why set about it with syllogisms ? \nTell people how disgusting it is fo r a man to pwnp more \ninto himself than he can hold and not to know the capacity \nof his own stomach. Tell them of all the things men do that \nthey would blush at sober, and that drunkenness is nothing \nbut a state of self -induced insanity. For imagine the drunken \nman's behaviour extended over several days: would you \nhesitate to think him out of his mind? As it is, the diff erence \nis simply one of duration, not of degree. Point to the example \nof Alexander of Macedon, stabbing his dearest and truest \nfriend, Clitus, at a banquet, and wanting to die, as indeed he \nshould have done, when he realized the enormity of what he \nhad done. Drunkenness inflames and lays bare every vice. \nremoving the reser\\re that acts as a check on impulses to \nwrong behaviour. For people abstain fr om fo rbidden things \nfar more often through fe elings of inhibition when it comes \nto doing what is wrong than through any will to good .... \nAdd to this the drunkard's ignorance of his situation, his \nindistinct, uncertain speech, his inability to walk straight, his \nunsteady eye and swimming head, with his very home in a \nstate of motion - as if the whole house had been set spinning \nby some cyclone - and the tortures in his stomach as the wine \nfe rments .... \nWhere is the glory in mere capacity? When the victory \nrests with you, when all the company lie prostrate around \nyou, slumbering or vomiting, declining all your calls fo r \n·another toast, when you find yourself the only person at the \nparty still on your fe et, when your mighty prowess has \nenabled you to beat all comers and no one has proved able \n143\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXXXJII, 2.4 \nto match your intake, a barr el is none the less enough to \nbeat you. \nWhat else was it but drinking to excess, together with a \npassion for Cleopatra itself as potent as drink, that ruined that \ngreat and gifted man, Mark Antony, dragging him down into \nforeign ways of living and un-Roman vices? This it was that \nmade him an enemy of the state; this is what made him no \nmatch for his enemies; it was this that made him crud, \nhaving the heads of his country's leading men brought in to \nhim at the dinner-table, identifying the hands and features of \nliquidated opponents in the course of banquets marked by \nsumptuous magnificence and regal pomp, still thirsting for \nblood when £ill ed to the full with wine .... \nExplain, then,· why the good man should avoid getting \ndrunk, using facts, not words, to show its uglin ess and offen­\nsiveness. Prove- and an easy task it is- that so-<:alled pleasures, \nwhen they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments .••• \nLETTER LXXXVI \nHERE I am, staying at the country house which once belonged \nto Scipio of Africa himsel£ I am writing after paying my \nrespects to his departed spirit as well as to an altar which I \nrather think may be the actual tomb of that great soldier. \nHis soul will have gone to heaven, returned in fact to the \nplace from which it came. What convinces me of this is not \nthe size of the armies he comman ded - for Cambyses equally \nhad such armies ::and Cambyses wa.S merely a madman who \nturned his madness to good account -b ut his quite exceptional \nself-restraint and sense of duty. This is something in him \nwhich I find even more deserving of admiration at the time \nwhen he finally lef t his country than during the time when he \n144\n\f\nLXXXVI, S LBTTBR LXXXV I \nwas fighting fo r her. Was Scipio to stay in Rome? Or was \nRome to stay a free democracy? That was then the choice. \nWhat did ·s cipio say? 'I have no wish,' he said, 't o have the \neff ect of weakening in the least degree our laws or institutions. \nAll Roman citizens must be equal · bef ore the law. I ask my \ncountry, then, to make the most of what I have done fo r her, \nbut without me. If she owes it to me that she is today a free \ncountry, let me also prove that she is fr ee. If my stature has \ngrown too great fo r her best interests, then out I go.' Am I \nnot justified in admiring that nobility of character which \nled him to retire, to go into voluntary exile to relieve the \nstate of an embarrassing burden? Events had come to the \npoint where either Scipio or democracy was going to suff er \nat the other's hands. Neither of these two things could justly \nbe permitted to happen. So he gave way to her constitution \nand, proposing that the nation should be no less indebted to \nhim fo r his absence from the scene than fo r Hanni bal's, he \nwent otfinto retirement at Litemum. \nI have seen the house, which is built of squared stone \nblocks; the wall surrounding the park; and the towers built \nout on both sides of the house fo r purposes of def ence; the \nwell, concealed among the greenery and out-buildings, with \nsuffi cient water to provide fo r the needs of a whole army; \nand the tiny little bath, situated af ter the old-f ashioned custom \nin an ill-lit comer, our ancestors believing that the only place \nwhere one could properly have a hot bath was in the dark. \nIt was this which started in my mind reflections that occa­\nsioned me a good deal of enjoyment as I compared Scipio's \nway of lif e and our own. In this comer the fa mous Terror of \nCarthage, to whom Rome owes it that she has only once* in \nher history been captured, used to wash a body weary from \nwork on the far m !

And this was the ceiling, dingy in the \nextreme, under which he stood; and this the equally undis­\ntinguished paving that carried his weight. \nWho is there who could bear to have a bath in such \nsurr oundings nowadays? We think ourselves poorly off, \nliving like paupers, if the walls are not ablaze with large and \ncostly circular mirrors, if our Alexandrian marbles are not \ndecorated with panels of Numidian marble, if the whole of \ntheir surface has not been given a decorative overlay of \nelaborate patterns having all the variety of fresco murals, \nunless the ceiling cannot be seen fo r glass, unless the pools into \nwhich we lower bodies with all the strength drained out of \nthem by lengthy periods in the sweating room are edged with \nThasian marble {which was once the rarest of sights even in a \ntemple), unless the water pours from silver taps. And so far \nwe have only been talking about the ordinary fe llow's \npltimbing. What about the bath-houses of certain fo rmer \nslaves? Look at their arrays of statues, their assemblies of \ncolunms that do not support a thing but are put up purely \nfo r ornament, just fo r the sake of spending money. Look at \nthe cascades of water splashing noisily down from one level \nto the next. We have actually come to such a pitch of choosi­\nness that we object to walking on anything other than precious \nstones. \nIn this bathroom of Scipio\"s there are tiny chinks -y ou \ncould hardly call them windows - pierced in the masonry of \nthe wall in such a way as to let in light without in any way \nweakening its def ensive character. Nowadays 'moth-hole\" is \nthe way some people speak of a bathroom unless it has been \ndesigned to catch the sun through enormous windows all \nday long, unless a person can acquire a tan at the same time \nas he is having a bath, unless he has views from the bath over \ncountryside and sea. \nThe result is that bath-houses which drew admiring \n146\n\f\nLXXXVI, II LBTTBR LXXX VI \ncrowds when they were first opened are actually dismissed as \nantiquated as soon as extravagance has hit on any novelty \ncalculated to put its own best previous eff orts in the shade. \nThere was a time when bath-houses were fe w and far be­\ntween, and never in the least luxuriously appointed - and \nwhy should they have been, considering that they were \ndesigned fo r use, not fo r diversion, and that admission only \ncost you a copper? There were no showers in those days, \nand the water did not come in a continuous gush as if from \na hot spring. People did not think it mattered then how clear \nthe water was in which they were going to get rid of the dirt. \nHeavens, what a pleasure it is to go into one of those half -lit \nbath-houses with their ordinary plastered ceilings, where you \nknew that Cato himself as aedile - or Fabius Maximus, or \non� of the Comelii - regulated the warmth of your water \nwith his own hand ! For, however high their rank, it was one \nof the duties of the aediles to enter all such premises as were \nopen to the public and enf orce standards of cleanliness and a \nhealthy sort of temperature, sufficient fo r practical purposes, \nnot the kind of heat which has recently come into fas hion, \nmore like that of a fu rnace - so much so indeed that a slave \nconvicted on a criminal charge might well be sentenced to \nbe bathed alive ! There doesn't seem to me to be any diff erence \nnow between 'your bath's warm' and 'your bath's boiling '. \n'How primitive!' Such is some people's verdict these days \non Scipio because he did not have extensive areas of glass to \nlet the daylight into the perspiring room, because it was not a \nhabit with him to stew in strong sunlight, letting the time go \nby until he was perfectly cooked in his own bathr�om. 'What \na sorry wretch of a man ! He didn't know how to live ! \nHe'd take his bath in water that was never filtered and often \ncloudy, practically muddy in fa ct af ter any heavy rain.' \nWell, it did not make much diff erence to Scipio if this was \nthe kind of bath he had; he went there to wash off sweat, not \n147\n\f\nLBTTBR S PROM A STOIC LXXXVI, II \nscent. And wbat do you think some people will say to this? \n\"Well, I don't envy Scipio; if that was the kind of bath he bad \nall the time, it was a real exile's life that he was leading. • \nYes, and what's more, if you must know, he didn't even \nhave a bath every day. Writers who have left us a record of \nlife in ancient Rome tell us that it was just their arms and legs, \nwhich of course they dirtied working, that people washed \nevery day, bathing all over only once a week on market day. \n\"O bviously,' someone will comment, \"there must have been \ntimes when they were positively disgusting.' And what do \nyou think they stank of? I'll tell you - of hard soldiering, of \nhard work, of all that goes to make up a man. Men are \ndirtier creatures now than they ever were in the days before \nthe coming of spotlessly clean bathroonu. What is it Horace \nsays when he wants to describe a man noted and indeed \nnotorious for the inordinate lengths to which he carried \npersonal fastidiousness? \nBacillus stinb of scented lozenges.* \nProduce Bucillus today and he might just as well • stink like \na goat •. He would be in the same position as the .Gargonius \nwith whom Horace contrasted him. For nowadays it is not \neven enough to use some scented ointment - it must be re­\napplied two or three times a day as a precaution against its \nevaporation on the person. I say nothing about the way people \npreen themselves on the perfume it carries, as if it were their \nown. \nIf all this strikes you as being excessively disapproving you \nmust put it down to the house's atmosphere! During my stay \nin it I've learnt from Aegialus (who's the present owner of \nthe estate, and gives a great deal of attention to its management) \nthat trees can be transplanted even when quite old - a lesson \nthat we old men need to learn when we reckon that every \n* Horace, Satires, I: 2.�7 and I: 4-92.. Horace actually wrote Rufillus. \n148\n\f\nLXXXVI, 18 L:STT:SR LXX XVI \none of us who puts down a new olive plantation is doing so \nfor someone else's benefit- now that I've seen him carefully \ntransplmting one of a number of trees that had given fruit \nunsrinringly over three and even four seasons . So you too can \nenjoy the shade of the tree which \nIs slow in coming up, is there to give \nYour gnndsons shade in later years, long hence,* \naccording to our Virgil, who was not concerned with the \nfacts but with poetic effect, his object being the pleasure of \nthe reader, not the instruction of the farmer. To pick out \nonly one example, let me quote the following passage which \nI felt compelled to find fault with today. \nIn Spring's the time for sowing beans; then, too, \nThe crumbling furrows, Clover, welcome you, \nAnd millet, too, receives her yearly care. t \nI leave you to conclude: from this whether the crops mentioned \nare to be planted at the same time as each other, and whether \nin each case they're to be sown in spring. As I write, it's \nJune, getting on for July now, too, and I've seen people \nharvesting beans and sowing millet on the same day. \nTo get back to our olive plantation, I saw two different \nmethods of planting used here. In the first, taking sizeab le \ntrees and lopping off the branches, cutting them back to a \nfoot from the stem, Aegialus transplanted them complete \nwith crown, pruning away the roots and leaving only the \nactual base, the part to which the roots are attached. This he \nplaced in the hole with an application of manure, and not \nonly earthed it in but trod and stamped the soil down hard. \nHe says that nothing gives such good results as this 'packing \nthem down', as he calls it ; what it does, of course, is to keep \n* Virgil, Gtorgics, II: sB. \nt Virgil, Gtorgics, l:2IS -I6. \n149\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC txXXVI, I8 \nout cold and wind ; and apart from that, the tree is less liable \nto be shifted, thus allowing the young roots to sprout and \nget,a grip on the soil when they are inevitably tender and \ntom from their precarious holds by the slightest disturb­\nance. He also sctapes the crown of the tree before covering \nit up, because (he says) new roots emerge wherever the wood \nunderneath has been laid bare. The tree, again, should not \nstand higher than three or four feet above the ground. This \nwill ensure, right from the start, green growth from the \nbottom upwards instead of a large area of dry and withered \nstem of the sort one sees in old olive-groves. · \nThe second method was as follows: taking branches of \nthe type one normally finds on very young trees; strong \nbut at the same time having soft bark, he planted them out \nin the same sort of way. These grow rather more slowly but \nsince they spring from what is virtually a cutting, there is \nnothing scraggy or unsightly about them. \nAnother thing I've seen is the transplanting of an old vine \nfrom its supporting tree ; in this case, one has to gather up \nwith it, if possible, even the minute root-hairs, and in addition \ngive it a more generous covering of soil so that it throws \nout roots from the stem as well. I have seen such plantings \nnot only in the month of February but even at the end of \nMarch, the vines going on to embrace and take good hold of \ntheir new elm trees. Aegialus also says that all trees which are \nstout in the stem, if one may so term them, should have the \nbenefit of a supply of water stored in tanks; if this is a success, \nwe have brought the rain under our control. \nBut I don't propose to tell you any more, in case I turn \nyou into a rival grower in the same way as Aegialus has \nturned me into a competitor ofhis I \nISO"

    "raw_text": "LXXXVDI, 4 \nLETTER LXXXVIII \nYou want to know my attitude towards liberal studies. \nWell, I have no respect fo r any study whatsoever if its end is \nthe making of money. Such studies are to me unworthy \nones. They involve the putting out of skills to hire, and are \nonly of value in so fa r as they may develop the mind without \noccupying it fo r long. Time should be spent on them only \nso long as one's mental abilities are not up to deali ng with \nhigher things. They are our apprenticeship, not our real work. \nWhy 'l iberal studies' are so called is obvious: it is because \nthey are the ones considered worthy of a free man.* But \nthere is really only one liberal study that deserves the name -\nbecause it makes a person free - and that is the pursuit of \nwisdom. Its high ideals, its steadf astness and spirit make all \nother studies puerile and puny in comparison. Do you really \nthink there is anything to be said fo r the others when you \nfind among the people who prof ess to teach them quite the \nmost reprehensible and worthless characters you could have \nas teachers? All right to have studied that sort of thing once, \nbut not to be studying them now. \nThe question has sometimes been posed whether these \nliberal studies make a man a better person. But in fa ct they \ndo not aspire to any knowledge of how to do this, let alone \nclaim to do it. Literary scholarship concerns itself with \nresearch into language, or history if a rather broader field is \npreferr ed, or, extending its range to the very lim it, . poetry. \nWhich of these paves the way to virtue? Attentiveness to \nwords, analysis of syllables, accounts of myths, laying down \nthe principles of prosody ? What is there in all this that dis­\npels fe ar, roots out desire or reins in passion? Or let us take a \nlook at music, at geometry; you will not find anything in \n\"*A liber. \nlSI\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXXXVDI,4 \nthem which tells us not to be afraid of this or desire that - and \nif anyone lacks this kind of knowledge all his other knowledge \nis valueless to him. The question is whether or not that sort \nof scholar is teaching virtue. For if he is not, he will not even \nbe imparting it incidentally. If he is teaching it he is a philo­\nsopher. If you really want to know how far these persons are \n&om the position of being moral teachers, observe the absence \nof connexion between all the things they study; if they were \nteaching one and the same thing a connexion would be evi­\ndent. Unless perhaps they manage to persuade you that \nHomer was actually a philosopher - though they refute their \ncase by means of the very passages which lead them to \ninfer it. For at one moment they make him a Stoic, giving \nnothing but virtue his approval, steering clear of pleasure, \nnot even an offer of immortality inducing him to stoop to the \ndishonourable ; at another they make him an Epicurean, \npraising the way of life of a society passing its days at peace \nand ease, in an atmosphere of dinner-parties and music­\nmaking ; at another he becomes a Peripatetic, with a three­\nfold classification of things good ; at another an Academic, \nstating that nothing is certain. It is obvious that none of these \nphilosophies is to be found in Homer for the very reason that \nthey all are, the doctrines being mutually incompatible. Even \nsuppose we grant these people that Homer was a philosopher, \nhe became a wise man, surely, before he could recite any \nepics, so that what we should be learning are the things which \nmade him wise. And there is no more point in my investigat­\ning which was the earlier, Homer or Hesiod, than there would \nbe in my knowing the reason why Hecuba, though younger \nthan Helen, carried her years so unsuccessfully. And what, I \nwould ask this kind of scholar, do you suppose is the point of \ntrying to establish the ages of Patroclus and Achil les? And \nare you more concerned to find out where Ulysses' wander­\nings took him than to find a way of putting an end to our own \nIj.Z\n\f\ntxXXVm, IO LBTTBR LXX XVIII \nperpetual wanderi ngs? We haven't the time to spare to hear \nwhether it was between Italy and Sicily that be ran into a \nstorm or somewhere outside the area of the world we know­\nwanderings as extensive as his could never in fa ct have taken \nplace inside so limited an area - when every day we're running \ninto our own storms, spiritual storms, and driven by vice \ninto all the troubles that Ulysses ever knew. We're not spared \nthose eye-distracting beauties, or attacker s. We too have to \ncontend in various places with savage monsters rev elling in \nhuman blood, insidious voices that beguile our ears, ship­\nwrecks and all manner of misf ortune. What you should be \nteaching me is how I may attain such a love fo r my country, \nmy fa ther and my wif e, and keep on course fo r those ideals \neven af ter shipwreck. Why go into the question whether or \nnot Penelope completely took in her contemporaries and was \nfa r from being a model of wif ely purity, any more than the \nquestion whether or not she had a fe eling that the man she \nwas looking at was Ulysses bef ore she actually knew it? Teach \nme instead what purity is, how much value there is in it, \nwhether it lies in the body or in the mind. \nTurning to the musical scholar I say this. You teach me \nhow bass and treble harmonize, or how strings producing \ndiff erent notes can give rise to concord. I would rather you \nbrought about some harmony in my mind and got my \nthoughts into tune. You show me which are the plaintive \nkeys. I would rather you showed me bow to avoid uttering \nplaintive notes when things go against me in lif e. \nThe geometrician teaches me how to work out the size of \nmy estates - rather than how to work out how much a man \nneeds in order to have enough. He teaches me to calculate, \nputting my fingers into the service of avarice, instead of teach­\ning me that there is no point whatsoever in that sort of \ncomputation and that a person is none the happier fo r having \nproperties which tire accountants out, or to put it another \n153\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC LXXXVDI, IO \nway, how superfluous a man's possessions are when he would \nbe a picture of misery if you fo rced him to start counting up \nsingle-handed how much he possessed. What use is it to me \nto be able to divide a piece of land into equal areas if I'm \nunable to divide it with a brother? What use is the ability to \nmeasure out a portion of an acre with an accuracy extending \neven to the bits which elude the measuring rod if I'm upset \nwhen some high-handed neighbour encroaches slightly on \nmy property? The geometrician teaches me how I may avoid \nlosing any fraction of my estates, but what I really want to \nlearn is how to lose the lot and still keep smiling. 'B ut I'm \nbeing turned off the land my fa ther and grandfather owned \nbef ore me ! ' Well, so what? Who owned the land bef ore your \ngrandfather? Are you in a position to identify the community, \nlet alone the individual, to whom it originally belonged? \nYou entered on it as a tenant, not an absolute owner. Whose \ntenant, you may ask ? Your heir's, and that only if you're \nlucky. The legal experts say that acquisition by prescription \nnever applies where the property concerned is actually public \nproperty. Well, what you possess and call your own is really \npublic property, or mankind's property fo r that matter. Oh, \nthe marvels of geometry! You geometers can calculate the \nareas of circles, can reduce any given shape to a square, can \nstate the distances separating stars. Nothing's outside your \nscope when it comes to measurement. Well, if you're such \nan expert, measure a man's soul ; 'tell me how large or how \nsmall that is. You can define a straight line ; what use is that \nto you if you've no idea what straightness means in lif e? \nI come now to the person who prides himself on his \nfamiliarity with the heavenly bodies : \nTowards which quarter chilly Saturn draws, \nThe orbits in which burning Mercury roams.* \n* Vrrgil , Georgics, I: 336-7. The penon meant is of course the \nastrologer, not the astronomer. \nIS.of.\n\f\nlXXXVIII, 17 LBTTBR LXX XVIII \nWhat is to be gained from this sort of knowledge? Am I \nsupposed to feel anxious when Saturn and Mars are in opposi­\ntion or Mercury sets in the evening in full view of Saturn, \ninstead of coming to learn that bodies like these are equally \npropitious wherever they are, and incapable of change in \nany case. They are swept on in a path from which they cannot \nescape, their motion governed by an uninterrupted sequence \nof destined events, making their reappearances in cycles that \nare fixed. They either actuate or signalize all that comes about \nin the universe.

Nothing will \ninduce me to accept painters into the list of liberal arts, any \nmore than sculptors, marble-masons and all the other attend­\nants on extravagance. I mwt equally reject those oil and dust \npractitioners, the wrestlers, or else I shall have to include in \nth� list the perfumers and cooks and all the others who place \ntheir talents at the service of our pleasures. What is there, I \nask you, that's liberal about those characters who vomit up \ntheir food to empty their stomachs for more, with their \nbodies stuffed full and their minds all starved and inactive? \nCan we possibly look on this as a liberal accomplishment \nfor the youth of Rome, whom our ancestors trained to stand \nup straight and throw a javelin, to toss the caber, and manage \na horse, and handle weapons? They never wed to teach \ntheir children anything which could be learned in a reclining \nposture. That kind of training, nevertheless, doesn't teach or \nfoster moral values any more than the other. What's the use, \nafter all, of mastering a horse and controlling him with the \nreins at full gall op if you're carried away yourself by totally \nunbridled emotions? What's the use of overcoming opponent \nafter opponent in the wrestling or boxing rings if you can be \novercome by your temper? \n•s o we don't,' you may ask, •in fact gain anything from \nthe liberal studies?' As far as character is concerned, no, but \nwe gain a good deal from them in other directions -j ust as \neven these admittedly inferior arts which we've been talking \nabout, the ones that are based on use of the hands, make \nimportant contributions to the amenities of lif e although they \nhave nothing to do with character. Why then do we give \nour sons a liberal education? Not because it can make them \nmorally good but because it prepares the mind for the \nacquisition of moral values. Jwt as that grounding in grammar, \nas they called it in the old days, in which boys are given their \nelementary schoolin g, does not teach them the liberal arts but \nIS6\n\f\ntxXXVID, JI LETTER LXX XVIII \nprepares the ground for knowledge of them in due course, so \nwhen it comes to character the liberal arts open the way to it \nrather than carry the personality all the way there . . . . * \nIn this connexion I feel prompted to take a look at indi­\nvidual qualities of character. Bravery is the one which treats \nwith contempt things ordinarily inspiring fear, despising and \ndefying and demolishing all the things that terrify us and set \nchains on human freedom. Is she in any way fortified by \nliberal studies? Take loyalty, the most sacred quality that \ncan be found in a human breast, never corrupted by a bribe, \nnever driven to betray by any form of compulsion, crying: \n'Beat me, bum me, put me to death, I shall not talk - the \nmore the torture probes my secrets the deeper I'll hide them!' \nCan liberal studies create that kind of spirit? Take self­\ncontrol, the quality which takes command of the pleasures; \nsome she dismisses out of hand, unable to tolerate them; \nothers she merely regulates, ensuring that they are brought \nwithin healthy limits; never approaching pleasures for their \nown sake, she realizes that the ideal limit with things you \ndesire is not the amount you would like to but the amount \nyou ought to take. Humanity is the quality which stops one \nbeing arrogant towards one's fellows, or being acrimonious. \nIn words, in actions, in emotions she reveals herself as kind \nand good-natured towards all. To her the troubles of anyone \nelse are her own, and anything that benefits herself she \nwelcomes primarily because it will be of benefit to someone \nelse. Do the liberal studies inculcate these attitudes? No, no \nmore than they do simplicity, or modesty and restraint, or \nfrugality and thrift, or mercy, the mercy that is as sparing \nwith another'.s blood as though it were its own, knowing \nthat it is not for man to make wasteful use of man. \nSomeone will ask me how I can say that liberal studies \n* Some 4S lines of the Latin are omitted for their relative lack of \ninterest (§§21 to 2.8). \nIS7"

My answer \nwould be this : there's no attaining morality without fo od \neither, but there's no connexion between morality and fo od. \nThe fa ct that a ship can't begin to exist without the timbers \nof which it's built doem' t mean that the timbers are of ' help' \nto it. There's no reason fo r you to assume that, X being \nsomething without which Y could never have come about, \nY carne about as a result of the assistance of X. And indeed it \ncan actually be argued that the attainment of wisdom is \nperf ectly possible without the liberal studies ; although \nmoral values are things which have to be learnt, they are \nnot learnt through these studies. Besides, what grounds could \nI possibly have fo r supposing that a person who has no \nacquaintance with books will never be a wise man? For \nwisdom does not lie in books. Wisdom publishes not words \nbut truths - and I'm not sure that the memory isn' t more \nreliable when it has no external aids to fa ll back on. \nThere is nothing small or cramped about wisdom. It is \nsomething calling fo r a lot of room to move. There are \nquestions to be answered concerning physical as well as \nhuman matters, questions about the past and about the fu ture, \nquestions about things eternal and things\" ephemeral, questions \nabout time itsel£ On this one subject of time just look how \nmany questions there are. To start with, does it have an \nexistence of its own? Next, does anything exist prior to time, \nindependently of it? Did it begin with the universe, or did it \nexist even bef ore then on the grounds that there was some­\nthing in existence bef ore the universe ? There are countless \nquestions about the soul alone -w here it comes from, what its \nnature is, when it begins to exist, and how long it is in \nexisten ce ; whether it passes from one place to another, moving \nhouse, so to speak, on transf er to successive living creatures, \ntaking on a diff erent fo rm with each, or is no more than \n1 58\n\f\nLXXXVDI. 37 LETTER LX XXV III \nonce in service and is then rdeased to roam the universe ; \nwhether it is a corporeal substance or not; what it will do \nwhen it ceases to act through us, how it will employ its \nfreedom once it has escaped its cage here; whether it will \nfo rget its past and become conscious of its real nature from \nthe actual moment of its parting from the body and departure \nfo r its new home on high. 'Whatever the fidd of physical or \nmoral sciences you deal with, you will be given no rest by the \nmass of things to be learnt or investigated. And to enable \nmatters of this range and scale to find unrestricted hospitality \nin our minds, everything superfluous must be turned out. \nVirtue will not bring herself to enter the limited space we \noff er her; something of great size requires plenty of room. \nLet everything else be evicted, and your heart completely \nopened to her. \n'But it's a nice thing, surely, to be fa miliar with a lot of \nsubjects.' Well, in that case let us retain just as much of them \nas we need. Would you consider a person open to criticism \nfo r putting superfluous objects on the same level as really \nuseful ones by arranging on display in his house a whole array \nof costly articles, but not fo r cluttering himself up with a lot \nof superfluous furniture in the way of learning? To want to \nknow more than is suffi cient is a fo rm of intemperance. \nApart from which this kind of obsession with the liberal arts \nturns people into pedantic, irritating, tactless, self -satisfied \nbores, not learning what they need simply because they spend \ntheir time learning things they will never need. The scholar \nDidymus wrote fo ur thousand works: I should fe d sorry fo r \nhim if he had merely read so many useless works. In these \nworks he discusses such questions as Homer's origin, who \nwas Aeneas' real mother, whether A.nacreon's mann er of \nlife was more that of a lecher or that of a drunkard, whether \nSappho slept with anyone who asked her, and other things \nthat would be better unlearned if one actually knew them I \nI.S9"

The people I ft.rst mentioned \nprovide me with knowledge which is not going to be of any \nuse to me, while the others snatch away from me any hopes of \never acquiring any knowledge at all. Superfluous knowledge \nwould be pref erable to no knowledge. One side off ers me no \nguiding light to direct my vision towards the truth, while the \nother just gouges my eyes out. If I believe Protagoras there is \nnothing certain in the universe; if I believe Nausiphanes \nthere is just the one certainty, that nothing is certain; if \nParmenides, only one thing exists; if Zeno, not even one. \nThen what are we? The things that surround us, the things on \nwhich we live, what are they? Our whole universe is no \nmore than a semblance of reality, perhaps a deceptive sem­\nblance, perhaps one without substance altogether.

I \nitself was something bestowed by the gods. They have given \nno one the present of a knowledge of philosophy, but every­\none the means of acquiring it. For if they had made philosophy \na blessing given to all and sundry, if we were born in a state \nof moral enlightenment, wisdom would have been deprived \nof the best thing about her - that she isn't one of the things \nwhich fortune either gives us or doesn't. As things are, there \nis about wisdom a nobility and magnificence in the fact that \nshe doesn't just fall to a person's lot, that each man owes her \nto his own efforts, that one doesn't go to anyone other than \noneself to find her. What would you have worth looking up \nto in philosophy if she were handed out free? \nPhilosophy has the single task of discovering the truth \nabout the divine and human worlds. The religious conscience, \nthe sense of duty, justice and all the rest of the close-knit, \ninterdependent 'company of virtues', never leave her side. \nPhilosophy has taught men to worship what is divine, to \nlove what is human, telling us that with the gods belongs \nauthority, and among human beings fellowship. That fellow­\nship lasted for a long time intact, bef ore men's greed broke \nsociety up - and impoverished even those she had brought \nmost riches; for people cease to possess everything as soon as \nthey want everything for themselves. \nThe first men on this earth, however, and their immediate \ndescendants, followed nature unspoiled; they took a single \nperson as their leader and their law, freely submitting to the \ndecisions of an individual of superior merit. It is nature's \nway to subordinate the worse to the better. With dumb \nanimals, indeed, the ones who dominate the group are either \nthe biggest or the fiercest. The bull who leads the herd is not \nthe weakling, but the one whose bulk and brawn has brought \nit victory over the other males. In a herd of elephants the \ntallest is the leader. Among human beings the highest merit \nmeans the highest position. So they used to choose their ruler \n162\n\f\nxc, 6 LETTER XC \nfor his character. Hence peoples were supremely fortunate \nwhen among them a man could never be more powerful than \nothers unless he was a better man than they were. For there is \nnothing dangerous in a man's having as much power as he \nlikes if he takes the view that he has power to do only what \nit is his duty to do. \nIn that age, then, which people commonly refer to as the \nGolden Age, government, so Posidonius maintains, was in \nthe hands of the wise. They kept the peace, protected the \nweaker from the stronger, urged and dissuaded, pointed out \nwhat was advantageous and what was not. Their ability to \nlook ahead ensured that their peoples never went short of \nanything, whilst their bravery averted dangers and their \ndevotedness brought well-being and prosperity to their \nsubjects. To govern was to serve, not to rule. No one used to \ntry out the extent of his power over those to whom he owed \nthat power in the first place. And no one had either reason or \ninclination to perpetrate injustice, since people governing \nwell. were equally well obeyed, and a king could issue no \ngreater threat to disobedient subjects than that of his own \nabdication. \nBut with the gradual infiltration of the vices and the \nresultant transformation of kingships into tyrannies, the need \narose for laws, laws which were themselves, to begin with, \ndrafted by the wise. Solon, who established Athens as a \ndemocratic state, was one of the seven men of antiquity \ncelebrated for their wisdom. If the same age had produced \nLycurgus, an eighth name would have been added to that \nrevered number. The laws of Zaleucus and Charondas are \nstill admired. And it was not in public life or in the chambers \nof lawyers that these two men learnt the constitutional \nprinciples which they were to establish in Sicily (then in its \nheyday) and throughout the Greek areas of Italy, but in the \nsecret retreat, now hallowed and famous, of Pythagoras. \n163"

    "raw_text": "LETTERS FROM A STOIC xc, 7 \nThus far I agree with Posidonius. But that philosophy \ndiscovered the techniques employed in everyday lif e, that \nI refuse to admit. I will not claim for philosophy a fame that \nbelongs to technology. 'It was philosophy, ' says Posidonius, \n'that taught men how to raise buildings at a time when they \nwere widely dispersed and their shelter consisted of huts or \nburrowed-out cliffs or hollowed tree trunks.' I for my part \ncannot believe that philosophy was responsible for the inven­\ntion of these modem feats of engineering that rise up storey \nafter storey, or the cities of today crowding one against the \nnext, any more than of our fish-tanks, those enclosures \ndesigned to save men's gluttony from having to run the risk \nof storms and to ensure extravagance safe harbours of her \nown, however wildly the high seas may be raging, in which to \nfatten separately the different kinds of fish. Are you really \ngoing to tell me that philosophy taught the world to use keys \nand bolts on doors - which was surely nothing but a signal \nfor greed? Was it philosophy that reared the towering build­\nings we know today, with all the danger they mean to the \npeople living in them? It was not enough, presumably, for \nman to avail himself of whatever cover came to hand, to have \nfound a shelter of some kind or. other in nature without \ntrouble and without the use of skills. Believe me, that age \n·before there ever existed architects or builders was a happy \nage. The squaring off of timbers, the accurate cutting of \nbeams with a saw that travels along a marked out line, all \nthese things came in with extravagance. \nThe first of men with wedges split their wood.* \nYes, for they were not preparing a roof for a future banquet­\ning-hall ; and pines or firs were not continually being drawn \nthrough streets trembling at their passage on a long convoy \n* Virgil, Georgics, 1: I#-\n164\n\f\nXC. 13 LETTER XC \nof vehicles to support panel led ceilings heavy with gold. \nTheir huts were held up by a forked pole stood at either end, \nand with dose-packed branches and a sloping pile of leaves a \nrun-off was arranged for even heavy rains. This was the kind \nof roof under which they lived and yet their lives were free \nof care. For men in a state of freedom had thatch for their \nshelter, while slavery dwells beneath marble and gold. \nAnother matter on which I disagree with Posidonius is \nhis belief that it was by wise men that tools were originally \ninvented. On that sort of basis there is nothing to stop him \nsaying that i• was by philosophers that \nDiscovered next were ways of maring game, \nOf catching birds with lime, of setting dogs \nAll round deep woods.* \nIt was human ingenuity, not wisdom, which discovered all \nthat. I disagree with him again where he maintains that it \nwas wise men who discovered iron and copper mining (when \nthe earth had been scorched by a forest fire and had melted to \nproduce a flow from surface veins of ore). The person who \ndiscovers that sort of thing is the kind of person who makes it \nhis business to be interested in just that sort of thing. Nor, for \nthat matter, do I find it as nice a question as Posidonius does, \nwhether the hammer started to come into general use before \nthe tongs or the other way round. They were both invented \nby some individual of an alert, perceptive turn of mind, \nbut not one with the qualities of greatness of of inspiration. \nAnd the same applies to anything else the quest of which \ninvolves a bent back and an earthward gaze. \nThe wise man then followed a simple way of lif e - which \nis hardly surprising when you consider how even in this \nmodern age he seeks to be as lit tle encumbered as he possibly \n* Virgil, Georgics, 1:1 39-40. \n165\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC XC, 14 \ncan. How, I ask you, can you consistently admire both Daeda­\nlus and Diogenes ? Tell me which of these two you would say \nwas a wise man, the one who hit on the saw, or the one who on \nseeing a boy drinking water from the hollow of his hand, \nimmediately took the cup out of his knapsack and smashed \nit, telling himself off for his stupidity in having superfluous \nluggage about him all that time, and curled himself up in a \njar 56 and .went to sleep. And today just tell me which of the \nfollowing you consider the wiser man: the one who dis­\ncovers a means of spraying saffron perfumes to a tremendous \nheight from hidden pipes, who fills or empties channels in \none sudden rush of water, who constructs a set of inter­\nchangeable ceilings for a dining room in such a way as to \nproduce a constant succession of different patterns, with a \nchange of ceiling at each course? Or the one who proves to \nothers and to himself that nature makes no demand on us \nthat is difficult or hard to meet and that we can live without \nthe marble-worker and the engineer, that we can clothe \nourselves without importing silks, that we can have the \nthings we need for our ordinary purposes if we will only be \ncontent with what the earth has made available on its sur­\nface. If they only cared to listen to this man, the human race \nwould realize that cooks are as wmecessary to them as are \nsoldiers. \nThat race of men to whom taking care of the body was a \nstraightforward enough matter were, if not philosophers, \nsomething very like it. The things that are essential are acquired \nwith little bother; it is the luxuries that call for toil and \neffort. Follow nature and you will feel no need of craftsmen. \nIt was nature's desire that we should not be kept occupied \nthus. She equipped us for everything she required us to \ncontend with. 'B ut the naked body can't stand cold.' So \nwhat? Are the skins of wild beasts and other creatures not \ncapable of giving us more than adequate protection against \n166\n\f\nXC, 18 LETTER XC \nthe cold? Is it not a fact that many peoples make a covering \nfor their bodies out of bark, that feathers are sewn together \nto serve as clothing, that even today the majority of the \nScythians wear the pelts of fox and mice, which are soft to \nthe touch and impervious to wind? Are you going to tell me \ntoo that any people you care to mention never used their \nhands to weave a basketwork of wattles, smear it all over with \ncommon mud and then cover the whole roof with long grass­\nstems and other material growing wild, and went through \nwinter weather, the rains streaming down the slopes of the \nroof, without any worry? 'B ut we need some pretty dense \nshade to keep off the heat of the sun in summer.' So what? \nHave past ages not left us plenty of hiding places that have \nbeen carved out by the ravages of time, or whatever other \ncause one cares to suppose, and have developed into caves? \nAnd again, is it not a fact that Syrtian tribes take shelt.er in \npits dug in the ground, as do other people who, because of \nextreme sun temperatures, find nothing less than the baked \nearth itself sufficiently substantial as a protective covering \nagainst the heat? When nature granted all the other animals \na simple passage through life, she was not so unfair to man as \nto make it impossible for him, for him alone, to live without \nall these skills. Nature demanded nothing hard from us, and \nnothing needs painful contriving to enable life to be kept \ngoing. We were born into a world in which things were \nready to our hands ; it is we who have made everything \ndifficult to come by through our own disdain for what is \neasily come by. Shelter and apparel and the means of warming \nbody and food, all the things which nowadays entail tremen­\ndous trouble, were there for the taking, free to all, obtainable \nat trifling effort. With everything the limit corresponded to \nthe need. It is we, and no one else, who have made those same \nthings costly, spectacular and obtainable only by means of a \nlarge number offull-scale techniques. \n167\n\f\nLBTT BRS PROM A STOIC XC, 19 \nNature suffices for all she asks of us. Luxury has turned \nher back on nature, daily urging herself on and growing \nthrough all the centu!ies, pressing men's intelligence into the \ndevelopment of the vices. First she began to hanker after \nthings that were inessential, and then after things that were \ninjurious, and. finally she handed the mind over to the body \nand commanded it to be the out and out slave of the body's \nwhim and pleasure. All those trades that give rise to noise or \nhectic activity in the city are in business for the body, which \nwas once in the position of the slave, having everything \nissued to it, and is now the master, having everyt hing pro­\ncured for it. This is the starting point for textile and engineer­\ning workshops, for the perf umes used by chefs, the sensual \nmovements of our dancing teachers, even sensual and un­\nmanly songs. And why? Because the bounds of nature, \nwhich set a limit to man's wants by relieving them only \nwhere there is necessity for such relief, have been lost sight of; \nto want simply what is enough nowadays suggests to people \nprimit iveness and squalor. \nIt is incredible, Lucilius, how easily even great men can be \ncarried away fr om the truth by the sheer pleasure of holding \nforth on a subject. Look at Posidonius, in my opinion one \nof those who have contr ibuted most to philosophy, when he \nwants to give a description of how, in the ft.rst place, some \nthreads are twisted and others drawn out fr om the soft, loose \nhank of wool, then how the warp has its threads stretched \nperpendicularly by means of hanging weights, and how \nthe weft (worked in to soften the hard texture of the warp \nthreads which compress it on either side) is made compact \nand close by means of the batten; he declares that philosophers \ninvented the art of the weaver too, forgetting that philosophers \nhad disappeared by the time this comparatively advanced \ntype of weaving in which \n168\n\f\nXC, 2J LETTER XC \nThe warp is bound to the beam, and then its threads \nAre parted by the reed, the woof worked in \nBetween with pointed shuttles and pressed home \nBy the broad comb's fretted teeth* \nhad been evolved. He might have thought differently if he \nhad only had the opportunity of seeing the looms of the \npresent day, the end product of which is clothing which is \nnot going to conceal a thing, clothing which is no help to \nmodesty let alone the body ! He then goes on to farmers, and \ngives an equally eloquent description of how the soil is \nbroken up by the plough for the first time and then gone over \nagain in order that ·the earth, thus loosened, may allow the \nroots more room to develop, and continues with the sowing \nof the seed and the lifting of the weeds to prevent any stray \nwild plants springing up and ruining the crop. All this, too, \nhe represents as being the work of philosophers, as if agricul­\nturists were not, now as ever, discovering plenty of new \nmethods ofincreasing the soil's productivity. \nNot content with these occupations, he proceeds to de­\nmean the philosopher to the bakery; he tells us how by imitat­\ning nature he began producing bread. 'The grain,' he says, \n'is taken into the mouth and crushed by the coming together \nof the hard surfaces of the teeth; anything that escapes is \ncarried back to the teeth again by the tongue, and the grain \nis finally mixed with saliva to enable it to pass down the \nlubricated throat with greater facility; on reaching the stomach, \nwhere it is cooked in an even heat, it is £inally absorbed into \nthe system. Taking this process as a model, someone or other \nplaced one rough stone on top of another in imitation of the \nteeth, one set of which remains immobile and awaits the \naction of the other; the grains are then crushed by the friction \nof the one against the other, and are constantly re-subjected \n* Ovid, Met4morphoses, VI: s s (apparently misquoted). \n169\n\f\nLBTTBRS PROM A STOIC XC, 23 \nto it until they are reduced by this repeated grinding to a fine \npowder.

'All these things,' \nsays Posidonius, 'were invented by our philosopher. They \nwere, however, rather too unimportant for him to handle \npersonally, and so he passed them over to the minions among \nhis assistants.' No, the fact is that this sort of thing was not \nthought up by anyone other than the people who make them \ntheir concern today.

    "raw_text": "LETTER S FROM A STOIC xc, 31 \nhe would have us think that it is the passage in Homer, \nrather than his story, that is spurious. I maintain that Anachar­\nsis was not responsible for this inven tion, and that even if he \nwas, he discovered it as a philosopher, yes, but not in his \ncapacity as a philosopher, in the same way as philosophers do \nplenty of things as men without doing them in their capacity \nas philosophers. Suppose, for example, a philosopher happens \nto be a very fast runner ; in a race he will come first by virtue \nof his ability as a runner, not by virtue of his being a philo­\nsopher. I should like to show Posidonius some gl ass-blower \nmoulding glass by means of his breath into a whole variety \nof shapes that could hardly be fashioned by the most careful \nhand - discoveries that have· occurred in the period since the \ndisappearance of the wise man. 'D emocritus,' he says, 'is \nreported to be the discoverer of the .arch, the idea of which \nis to bind a curving line of stones, set at slightly differing \nangles from each other, with a keystone.' This I should say \nwas quite untrue. For there must have been both bridges and \ngateways bef ore Democritus' time, and the upper parts of \nthese generally have a curve to them. And it seems to have \nescaped your memory, Posidonius, that this same Democritus \ndiscovered a means of softening ivory, and a means of turning \na pebble into an 'emerald' by boiling it, a method employed \neven today for colouring certain stones that man has dis­\ncovered and found amenable to the process. These tech­\nniques may indeed have been discovered by a philosopher, \nbut not in his capacity as a philosopher. For there are plenty \nof things which he does which one sees being done jwt as \nwell if not with greater skill and dexterity by persons totally \nlacking in wisdom. \nWhat has the philosopher invest igated? What has the \nphilosopher brought to light? In the first place, truth and \nnature (having, unlike the rest of the animal world, followed \nnature with more than jwt a pair of eyes, things slow to \n172\n\f\nXC, 37 LETTER XC \ngrasp divinity) ; and secondly, a rule of lif e, in which he has \nbrought life into line with things universal. And he has \ntaught us not just to recognize but to obey the gods, and to \naccept all that happens exactly as if it were an order from \nabove. He has told us not to listen to false opinions, and has \nweighed and valued everything against standards which are \ntrue. He has condemned pleasures an inseparable element of \nwhich is subsequent regret, has commended the good things \nwhich will always satisfy, and for all to see has made the \nman who has no need of luck the luckiest man of all, and the \nman who is master of himself the master of all. \nThe philosophy I speak of is not the one* which takes the \ncitizen out of public life and the gods out of the world we \nlive in, and hands morality over to pleasure, but the philo­\nsophy which thinks nothing good unless it is honourable, \nwhich is incapable of being enticed astray by the rewards of \nmen or fortune, and the very pricelessness of which lies in \nthe fact that it cannot be bought at any price. And I do not \nbelieve that this philosophy was in existence in that primitive \nera in which technical skills were still unknown and useful \nknowledge was acquired through actual practical experience, \nor that it dates from an age that was happy, an age in which \nthe bounties of nature were freely available for the use of \nall without discrimination, before avarice and luxury split \nhuman beings up and got them to abandon partnership for \nplunder. The men of that era were not philosophers, even if \nthey acted as philosophers are supposed to act,t No other \nstate of man could cause anyone greater admiration; if God \nwere to allow a man to fashion the things of this earth and allot \nits peoples their social customs, that man would not be satisfied \nwith any other system than the one which tradition says \nexisted in those people's time, among whom \n* Epicureanism. \nt i.e. 'in accordance with nature'. \n173\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC \nNo farmers tilled ploughed fields; merely to mark \nThe line ofboundaries dividing_land \nBetween its owners was a sin; men shared \nTheir findings, and the earth herself then gave \nAll things more freely unsolicited.* \nXC, 37 \nWhat race of men could be luckier? Share and share alike \nthey en joyed nature. She saw to each and every man's \nrequirements for survival like a parent. What it all amounted \nto was undisturbed possession of resources owned by the \ncommunity. I can surely call that race of men one of un­\nparalleled riches, it being impossible to find a single pauper \nin it. \nInto this ideal state of things burst avarice, avarice which in \nseeking to put aside some article or other and appropriate it \nto its own use, only succeeded in making everything some­\nbody else's property and reducing its possessions to a fraction \nof its previously unlimited wealth. Avarice brought in \npoverty, by coveting a lot of possessions losing all that it had. \nThis is why although it may endeavour to make good its \nlosses, may acquire estate after estate by buying out or \nforcing out its neighbours, enlarge country properties to the \ndimensions of whole provinces, speak of 'owning some \nproperty' when it can go on a long tour overseas without once \nstepping off its own land, there is no extension of our \nboundaries that can bring us back to our starting point. \nWhen we have done everything within our power, we shall \npossess a great deal: but we once possessed the world. \nThe earth herself, untilled, was more productive, her \nyields being more than ample for the needs of peoples who \ndid not raid each other. With any of nature's products, men \nfound as much pleasure in showing others what they had dis­\ncovered as they did in discovering it. No one could outdo or \n*V irgil, Geor gics, 1: us-8. \n174\n\f\nXC, 43 LBTTER XC \nbe outdone by any other. All was equally divided among \npeople living in complete harmony. The stronger had not \nyet started laying hands on the weaker; the avaricious person \nhad not yet started hiding things away, to be hoarded for his \nown private use, so shutting the next man off from actual \nnecessities of life; each cared as much about the other as \nabout himsel£ Weapons were unused ; hands still unstained \nwith human blood had directed their hostility exclusively \nagainst wild beasts. \nProtected from the sun in some thick wood, living in \nsome very ordinary shelter under a covering of leaves pre­\nserving them from the rigours of winter or the rain, those \npeople passed tranquil nights with never a sigh. We in our \ncrimson luxury toss and turn with worry, stabbed by needling \ncares. What sof t sleep the hard earth gave those people! \nThey had no carved or panelled ceilings hanging over \nthem. They lay out in the open, with the stars slipping past \nabove them and the firmament silently conveying onward \nthat mighty work of creation as it was carried headlong \nbelow the horizon in the magnificent pageant of the night \nsky. And they had clear views by day as well as by night of \nthis loveliest of mansions, enjoying the pleasure of watching \nconstellations falling away from the zenith and others rising \nagain from out of sight beneath the horizon. Surely it was a \njoy to roam the earth with marvels scattered so widely \naround one. You now, by contrast, go pale at every noise \nyour houses make, and if there is a creaking sound you run \naway along your frescoed passages in alarm. Those people \nhad no mansions on the scale of towns. Fresh air and the \nuntrammelled breezes of the open spaces, the unoppressive \nshade of a tree or rock, springs of crystal clarity, streams \nwhich chose their · own course, streams unsullied by the \nwork of man, by pipes or any other interference with their \nnatural channels, meadows whose beauty owed nothing to \n175\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC XC, 43 \nman's art, that was the environment around their dwelling \nplaces in the countryside, dwelling places given a simple \ncountryman's finish. This was a home in conformity with \nnature, a home in which one enjoyed living, and which \noccasioned neither fear of it nor fears for it, whereas nowa­\ndays our own homes count for a large part of our feeling \nof insecurity. \nBut however wonderful and guileless the life they led, \nthey were not wise men; this is a title that has come to be \nreserved for the highest of all achievements. All the same, I \nshould be the last to deny that they were men of exalted \nspirit, only one step removed, so to speak, from the gods. \nThere can be no doubt that before this earth was worn out it \nproduced a better type of offspring. But though they all \npossessed a character more robust than that of today, and \none with a greater aptitude for hard work, it is equally true \nthat their personalities fell short of genuine perfection. For \nnature does not give a man virtue : the process of becoming a \ngood man is an art. Certainly they did not go in search of \ngold or silver or the various crystalline stones to be found in \nthe nethermost dregs of the earth. They were still merciful \neven to dumb animals. Man was far and away from killing \nman, not out of fear or provocation, but simply for entertain­\nment. They had yet to wear embroidered clothing, and had \nyet to have gold woven into robes, or even mine it. But the \nfact remains that their innocence was due to ignorance and \nnothing else. And there is a world of difference between, on \nthe one hand, choosing not to do what is wrong and, on the \nother, not knowing how to do it in the first place. They \nlacked the cardinal virtues of justice, moral insight, self­\ncontrol and courage. There were corresponding qualities, \nin each case not unlike these, that had a place in their primi­\ntive lives; but virtue only comes to a character which has been \nthoroughly schooled and trained and brought to a pitch of \n176\n\f\nXCI, 2.

It is a disaster by which anyone might be shaken, let \nalone a person quite devoted to his home town. This event \nhas left him groping for that staunchness of spirit which, \nnaturally enough, he cultivated when it was a case of facing \nwhat to him were conceivable fears. One is not surprised, \nthough, that there were never any advance fears of such an \nunexpected, virtually unheard of catastrophe, considering \nthat there was no precedent for it. Plenty of cities have \nsuffered damage by fire, but none has ever been blotted out by \none. Even when its buildings have been set aflame by enemy \nhands, in many places the flames die out, and even if they are \ncontinually rekindled they are seldom so all-consuming as to \nleave nothing for tools to demolish. Earthquakes, too, have \nhardly ever been so ruinous and violent as to raze whole \ntowns. There has never in fact been a fire so destructive as to \nleave nothing for a future fire to consume. But here a \nsingle night has laid low a host of architectural splendours \nany one of which might have been the glo ry of a separate \ncity. In the depth of peace there has come such a blow as \ncould not have been dreaded in war itsel£ Who would \nbelieve it?

And he has some reason to be shaken. What \nis quite wtlooked fo r is more crushing in its eff ect, and \nwtexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster. The fa ct \nthat it was unf oreseen has never fa iled to intensify a person's \ngrief. This is a reason fo r ensuring that nothing ever takes \nus by surprise. We should project our thoughts ahead of w \nat every tum and have in mind every possible eventuality \ninstead of only the usual course of events.

No moment is exempt: in the midst of pleasures \nthere are fo wtd the springs of suff ering. In the middle of \npeace war rears its head, and the bulwarks of one's security \nare transf ormed into sources of alarm, friend turning foe \nand ally turning enemy. The summer's calm is upset by \nsudden storms more severe than those of winter. In the absence \nof any enemy we suff er all that an enemy might wreak on us. \nOvermuch prosperity if all else fa ils will hit on the instru­\nments of its own destruction. Sickness assails those leading \nthe most sensible lives, tuberculosis those with the strongest \nconstitutions, retribution the utterly guiltless, violence the \n178\n\f\nXCI, 8 LETTER XCI \nmost secluded. Misf ortune has a way of choosing some un-o \nprecedented means or other of impressing its power on those \nwho might be saiQ. to have forgotten it. A single day strews \nin ruins all that was raised by a train of construction extend­\ning over a long span of time and involving a great number \nof separate works and a great deal of favour on the part \nof heaven. To say a 'day ', indeed, is to put too much of \na brake on the calamities that hasten down upon us: an \nhour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of \nempires. It would be some relief to our condition and our \nfrailty if all things were as slow in their perishing as they \nwere in their coming into bei ng : but as it is, the growth \nof things is a tardy process and their undoing is a rapid \nmatter. \nNothing is durable, whether for an individual or for a \nsociety; the destinies of men and cities alike sweep onwards. \nTerror strikes amid the most tranquil surroundings, and with­\nout any disturbance in the background to give rise to them \ncalamities spring from the least expected quarter. States \nwhich stood firm through civil war as well as wars external \ncollapse without a hand being raised against them. How few \nnations have made of their prosperity a lasting thing ! This is \nwhy we need to envisage every possibility _and to strengthen \nthe spirit to deal with the things which may conceivably come \nabout. Rehearse them in your mind : exile, torture, war, ship­\nwreck. Misfo rtune may snatch you away from your country, \nor your country away from you., may banish you into some \nwilderness - these very surroundings in which the masses \nsuff ocate may become a wilderness. All the terms of our \nhuman lot should be before our eyes; we should be anticipat­\ning not merely all that commonly happens but all that is \nconceivably capable of happening, if we do not want to be \noverwhelmed and struck numb by rare events as if they were \nunprecedented ones; fortune needs envisaging in a thoroughly \n179\n\f\nLBTT BRS PROM A STOIC XCI, 8 \ncomprehensive way. Think how often towns in Asia or in \nGreece have fa llen at a single earth tremor, how many villages \nin Syria or Macedonia have been engulf ed, how often this \nfo rm of disaster has wrought devastation in Cyprus, how \noften Paphos has tumbled about itself! Time and again we \nhear the news of the annihilation of a whole city, and how \nsmall a fraction of mankind are we who hear such news thw \nof ten! So let w face up to the blows of circumstance and be \naware that whatever happens is never as seriow as ru.mour \nmakes it out to be. \nSo a city has burned, a wealthy city and the glory of the \nprovinces of which it was a fea ture though it stood in a \nclass of its own, perched as it was on a single hill and that not \na hill of very great dimensions. But time will sweep away the \nvery traces of every one of those cities of whose splendour \nand magnificence you nowadays hear. Look at the way the \nvery fo undations of once famow cities of Greece have been \neroded by now to the point where nothing is lef t to show \nthat they ever even existed. And it is not only the works of \nhuman hands that waste away, nor only structures raised by \nhuman skill and indwtry that the passing days demolish. \nMountain massifs crumble away, whole regions have sub­\nsided, the waves have covered landmarks once fa r out of \nsight of the sea. The immense fo rce of volcanic fires that once \nmade the mountain-tops glow has eaten them away and \nreduced to lowly stature what once were soaring peaks, \nreassuring beacons to the mariner. The works of nature \nherself suff er. So it is only right that we should bear the over­\nthrow of cities with resignation. They stand jwt to fa ll. \nSuch is the sum total of the end. that awaits them, whether \nit be the blast of a subterranean explosion throwing off the \nrestraining weight above it, or the violence of floodwaters \nincreasing to a prodigious degree underground until it \nbreaks down everything in its way, or a volcanic outburst \n180\n\f\nXCI, IS LETTER XCI \nfracturing the earth's crust, or age (to which nothing is \ninunune) overcoming them little by little, or plague carry­\ning off its population and causing the deserted area to decay. \nIt would be tedious to recount all the differer t ways by which \nfate may overtake them. One thing I know: all the works of \nmortal man lie under sentence of mortality, we live among \nthings that are destined to perish. \nSuch, then, are the comforting reflections which I would \noffer our Liberalis, who burns with a kind of passion beyond \nbelief for his birthplace - which it may be has only been \nconsumed so as to be called to higher things. A setback has \noften cleared the way for greater prosperity. Many things \nhave faHen only to rise to more exalted heights. That opponent \nof affluence in the capital, Timagenes, used to declare that \nthe one reason fires distressed him was the knowledge that \nwhat would rise up afterwards would be of a better standard \nthan what had burned. In the city of Lyons, too, one may \npresume that everyone will endeavour to make the work of \nrestoration a greater, more noble achievement than what \nthey have lost. May that work be of lasting duration, and \nmay the new foundation be attended by happier auspices \nwith a view to its lasting for a longer and indeed for all time I \nThis is the hun.!redth year since the town came into being, \nand even for a human being such an age is by no means the \nuttermost limit. Founded by Plancus in an area of <..oncen­\ntrated population, it owes its growth to its favourable situa­\ntion: yet how many grievous blows it has had to suffer in \nthe time it takes for a man to grow old. \nSo the spirit must be trained to a realization and an accept­\nance of its lot. It must come to see that there is nothing fortune \nwill shrink from, that she wields the same authority over \nemperor and empire alike and the same power over cities as \nover men. There's no ground for resentment in all this. \nWe've entered into a world in which these. are the terms life \n181\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC xa, IS \nis lived on - if you're satisfied with that, submit to them, if \nyou're not, get out, whatever way you please. Resent a \nthing by all means if it represents an injustice decreed against \nyourself personal ly; but if this same constraint is binding on \nthe lowest and the highest alike, then make your peace again \nwith destiny, the destiny that unravels all ties. There's no \njustification for using our graves and all the variety of monu­\nments we see bordering the highways as a measure of our \nstature. In the ashes all men are levelled. We're hom unequal, \nwe die equal. And my words apply ·as much to cities as to \nthose who live in them. Ardea was taken, and so was Rome. \nThe great lawgiver draws no distinctions between us accord­\ning to our birth or the celebrity of our names, save only while \nwe exist. On the reaching of mortality's end he declares, \n• Away with snobbery; all that the earth carries shall forthwith \nbe subject to one law without discrimination.' When it comes \nto all we're required to go through, we're equals. No one is \nmore vulnerable than the next man, and no one can be more \nsure ofhis surviving to the morrow. \nKing Alexander of Macedon once took up the study of \ngeometry - poor fellow, inasmuch as he would thus fmd out \nhow minute the earth really was, the earth of which he had \npossessed himself of a tiny part ; yes, 'poor fell ow' I call him, \nfor the reason that he was bound to discover that his title \nwas a false one; for who can be 'G reat ' in an area of minute \ndimensions? Anyway, the points he was being instructed in \nwere of some subtlety and such that the learning of them \ndemanded the closest concentration, not the sort of thing \nthat would be grasped by a crazed individual projecting his \nthoughts across the seas. 'Teach me,' he said, 'the easy things,' \nto which his instructor answered, 'These things are the same \nfor everyone, equally difficult for all.' Well, imagine that \nnature is saying to you, 'Those things you grumble about are \nthe same for everyone. I can give no one anything easier. \n182."

The man who does not \n184\n\f\nCIV, 6 LETTER CIV \nvalue his wife or a friend highly enough to stay on a little \nlonger in life, who persists in dying in spite of them, is a \nthoroughly self-indulgent character. This is a duty which the \nsoul should also impose on itself when it is merely the con­\nvenience of near and dear ones that demands it. And not only \nif and when it feels the wish to die, but also if and when it \nhas begun to carry out the wish, it mould pause a while to \nfit in with their interests. \nTo return to life for another's sake is a sign of a noble \nspirit; it is something that great men have done on a number \nof occasions. Yet to give your old age greater care and atten­\ntiveness in the realization that this pleases any of the persons \nclosest to you, or is in their interests, or would be likely to \ngratify them (and this in spite of the fact that the greatest \nreward of that period is the opportunity it gives you to adopt \na relatively carefree attitude towards looking after yourself \nand a more adventurous manner of living), is also, to my \nmind, a mark of the highest possible kindness. Besides it \nbrings you more than a little pleasure and recompense : for \ncan anythirlg be sweeter than to flnd that you are so dear to \nyour wife that this makes you dearer to yourself? So it comes \nabout that my Paulina succeeds in making me responsible for \nanxiety of my own as well as hers on my behal£ \nI expect you're keen to hear what effect it had on my \nhealth, this decision of mine to leave? Well, no sooner had I \nleft behind the oppressive atmosphere of the city and that \nreek of smoking cookers which pour out, along with a cloud \nof ashes, all the poisonous fumes they've accumulated in \ntheir interiors whenever they're started up, than I noticed \nthe change in my condition at once. You can imagine how \nmuch stronger I felt after reaching my vineyards ! I fairly \nwaded into my food - talk about animals just turned out on \nto spring grass! So by now I am quite my old self again. That \nfeeling of listlessness, being bodily ill at ease and mentally \n185\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC crv, 6 \ninefficient, didn't last. I'm beginning to get down to some \nwhole-hear ted work. \nThis is not something, however, to which mere surr ound­\nings are conducive, unless the mind is at its own disposal, \nable at will to provide its own seclwion even in crowded \nmoments. On the contrary, the man who spends his time \nchoosing one resort af ter another in a hunt fo r peace and \nquiet, will in every place he visits ftnd something to prevent \nhim fr om relaxing. The story is told that someone com­\nplained to Socrates that travelling abroad had never done \nhim any good and received the reply: 'What else can you \nexpect, seeing that you always take yourself along with you \nwhen you go abroad ?' What a blessing it would be fo r some \npeople if they could only lose themselves ! As things are these \npersons are a worry and a burden, a source of demoralization \nand anxiety, to their own selves. What good does it do you to \ngo overseas , to move fr om city to city? If you really want to \nescape the things that harass you, what you'r e needing is not \nto be in a diff erent place but to be a diff erent person. Suppose \nyou've arrived in Athens, or suppose it's Rhodes - choose \nany country you like - what diff erence does the character of \nthe place make? You'll only be importing your own with \nyou. You'll still look on wealth as a thing to be valued: your \npoverty will be causing you torment, while {this being the \nmost pathetic thing about it all) your poverty will be imagin­\nary. However much you possess ther e's someone else who has \nmore, and you'll be fan cying yourself to be short of things you \nneed to the exact extent to which you lag behind him. \nAnother thing that you'll regard as something to be valued is \nsuccess in public life ; in which case you're going to fe el \nresentment when so-and-so is elected consul (or when \nso-and-so is re-elected fo r that matter) , and be jealous when­\never you see a perso n's name appearing too of ten in the \nhonours-l ists. Your ambition will be r unnin g at so fe verish a \n186\n\f\nav, I2 LBTTER CIV \npitch that if anyone's ahead of you in the race you'll see \nyourself as coming last. \nDeath you'll think of as the worst of all bad things, though \nin fact there's nothing bad about it at all except the thing \nwhich comes before it - the fear of it. You'll be scared stiff \nby illusory as well as genuine dangers, haunted by imaginary \nalarms. What good will it do you to \nHave fo und a route past all those Argive fo rts \nAnd won escape right through the enemy's lines?* \nPeace itself will supply you with new fears. If your mind \nhas once experienced the shocks of fright you'll no longer \nhave any confidence even in things which are perfectly \nsafe ; once it has acquired the habit of unthinking panic, it is \nincapable even of attending to its own self-preservation. For \nit runs away from dangers instead of taking steps to avert \nthem, and we're far more exposed to them once our backs \nare turned. \n. \nTo lose someone you love is something you'll regard as the \nhardest of all blows to bear, while all the time this will be as \nsilly as crying because the leaves fall from the beautiful trees \nthat add to the charm of your home. Preserve a sense of \nproportion in your attitude to everything that pleases you, \nand make the most of them while they. are at their best. At \none moment chance will carry off one of them, at another \nmoment another; but the falling of the leaves is not difficult \nto bear, since they grow again, and it is no more hard to bear \nthe loss of those whom you love and regard as brightening \nyour existence; for even if they do not grow again they are \nreplaced. 'But their successors will never be quite the same.' \nNo, and neither will you. Every day, every hour sees a \nchange in you, although the ravages of time are easier to \nsee in others; in your own case they are far less obvious, \n*Virgil, Aeneid, ill :2 82-3. \n187\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC CIV, 12 \nbecause to you they do not show. While other people are \nsnatched away from us, we are being filched away surrepti­\ntiously from ourselves. \nAre you never going to give any of these considerations \nany thought and never going to apply any healing treatment \nto your wounds, instead of sowing the seeds of worry for \nyourself by hoping for this or that, or despairing of obtaining \nthis or that other thing? If you're sensible you'll run the two \ntogether, and never hope without an element of despair, \nnever despair without an element of hope. \nWhat good has travel of itself ever been able to do anyone? \nIt has never acted as a check on pleasure or a restraining in­\nfl.uen�e on desires; it has never controlled the temper of an \nangry' man or quelled the reckless impulses of a lover ; never \nin fact has it rid the personality of a fault. It has not granted \nus the gift of judgement, it has not put an end to mistaken \nattitudes. All it has ever done is distract us for a little while, \nthrough the novelty of our surroundings, like children \nfascinated by something they haven't come across before. \nThe instability, moreover, of a mind which is seriously un­\nwell, is aggravated by it, the motion itself increasing the \nfitf ulness and restlessness. This explainS why people, after \nsetting out for a place with the greatest of enthusiasm, are \noften more enthusiastic about getting away from it ; like \nmigrant birds, they fly on, away even quicker than they came. \nTravel will give you a knowledge of other countries, it \nwill show you mountains whose outlines are quite new to \nyou, stretches of unfami liar plains, valleys watered by peren­\nnial streams ; it will allow you to observe the unique features \nof this or that river, the way in which, for example, the Nile \nrises in summ er flood, or the Tigris vanishes from sight and \nat the completion of its journey through hidden subterranean \nregions is restored to view with its volume undiminished, or \nthe way the Meander, theme of every poet's early training \n188"

Who hasn't \n*Virgil, Aeneid, VI:277. \n191\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC CIV, 26 \nnoticed how much easier they are in the actual doing? It's \nnot because they're hard that we lose confidence; they're \nhard because we lack the confidence. \nIf you still need an example, take Socrates, an old man who \nhad known his full share of suffering, who had taken every \nblow life could inflict, and still remained unbeaten either by \npoverty, a bmden for him aggravated by domestic worries, \nor by constant hardships, including those endured on military \nservice. Apart from what he had to contend with at home -\nwhether one thinks of his wif e with her shrewish ways and \nnagging tongue, or his intractable children, more like their \nmother than their father - his whole life was lived either in \nwar-time or under tyranny or under a 'd emocracy' that \noutdid even wars and tyrants in its cruelties. The war went \non for twenty-seven years. Af ter the fighting was ended, the \nstate was handed over to the mercy of the Thirty Tyrants, a \nconsiderable number of whom were hostile to him. The \nfinal blow was his conviction and sentence on the most \nserious of charges : he was accused of blasphemy and of \ncorrupting the younger generation, whom, it was all eged, he \nturned into rebels against God, their fathers and the state. \nAfter that came the prison and the poison. And so little effect \ndid all this have on Socrates' s pirit, it did not even affect the \nexpression on his face. What a rare and wonderful story of \nachievement! To the very last no one ever saw Socrates in \nany particular mood of gaiety or depression. Through all the \nups and downs of fortune his was a level temperament. \nWould you like another example? Take the modem one of \nMarcus Cato, with whom fortune deal t in an even more \nbelligerent and unremitting fashion. At every point she stood \nin his way, even at the end, at his death; yet he demonstrated \nthat a brave man can live in defiance offortune and can die in \ndefiance of fortune. The whole of his life was passed either in \ncivil war or in conditions of developing civil conflict. And of \n192\n\f\nCJV, 32 LETTER CIV \nhim no less than of Socrates it is possible to say that he carried \nhimself clear of slavery* (unless, perhaps, you take the view \nthat Pompey, Caesar and Crassus were friends of freedom). \nWhen his country was in a state of constant change, no one \never saw a change in Cato. In every situation he was placed \nin, he showed himself always the same man, whether in office \nas praetor, in def eat at the polls, under attack in court, as \ngovernor . in his province, on the public platform, in the \nfield, or in death itself. In that moment, too, of panic for the \nRepublic, when Caesar stood on the one side, backed by ten \nlegions of the fmest fighting men and the entire resources \nand support of foreign countries as well, and on the other \nstood Pompey, by himself a match for all comers, and when \npeople were moving to join either the one or the other, Cato \nall on his own established something of a party pledged to \nfight for the Republic. If you try to picture the period to \nyourself you will see on the one side the populace, the mob \nall agog for revolution, on the other the time-honoured \nelect of Rome, the aristocracy and knighthood; and two \nforlorn figures, Cato and republicanism, between them. You \nwill find it an impressive sight, I can assure you, as you watch \nThe Son of Atreus and King Priam with \nAchilles wroth with both. t \nFor there is Cato denouncing each of them, trying to disarm \nthe pair of them. And the way he casts his vote between them \nis: 'If Caesar wins, I kill myself; if Pompey, I go into exile.' \nWhat had a man to fear who, win or lose, had dictated to \nhimself such a choice of fates as might have· been decreed \nhim by an utterly exasperated enemy? And that is how he \ncame to die, carrying out his own self-sentence. \n* At this point of uncertainty in the text I have adopted the reading \nservituti se eduxisse suggested by Haase. \nt Virgil, Aeneid, I: 458. \n193\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC Cl'f• 33 \nYou will see, too, the capacity of man for hardship: on \nfoot at the head of his troops he crossed the deserts of North \nAfrica. You see that thirst can be endured as well: always in \narmour, trailing over a sun-baked plateau the remnants of a \nbeaten army, an army without supplies, he was invariably the \nlast to drink whenever they came upon water. You see that \na man can think equally little of either the distinction of office \nor the stigma of rejection: on the day of his election defeat he \nplayed fives at the place of polling. You see that men can defy \nthe might of their superiors: for, with no one daring offend \neither Caesar or Pompey except to curry favour with the \nother, Cato challenged the pair of them simultaneously. You \nsee that a man can think as little of death as of exile: he \ncondemned himself to both, and war in the meantime. \nWe, then, can show as spirited an attitude to just the same \nthings if we will only choose to slip the yoke from our necks. \nBut first we have to reject the lif e of pleasures; they make us \nsoft and womanish; they are insis.tent in their demands, and \nwhat is more, require us to make insistent demands on fortune. \nAnd then we need to look down on wealth, which is the wage \nof slavery. Gold and silver and everything else that clutters \nour prosperous homes should be discarded. Freedom cannot \nbe won without sacrifice. If you set a high value on her, \neverything else must be valued at little. \nLETTER CV \nYEs, I'll give you some rules to observe that will enable you \nto live in greater safety.

Envy you'll escape if you haven't \nobtruded yourself on other people's notice, if you haven't \nflaunted your possessions, if you've learnt to keep your satis­\nfaction to yoursel£ Hatred either comes from giving offence, \nand that you'll avoid by ref raining from deliberately provok­\ning anyone, or is quite uncalled for: here yoUr saf eguard will \nbe ordinary tact.

As regards not being feared, a \nmoderate fortune and an easy-going nature will secure you \nthat. People should see that you're not a person it is dangerous \nto offend : and with you a reconciliation should be both easy \nand dependable. To be feared inside your own home, it may \nbe added, is as much a source of trouble as being feared out­\nside it - slave or free, there isn't a man who hasn't power \nenough to do you injury.

What we can do is adopt \na noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good man, so that we \nmay bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring \nour wills into tune with nature's; reversals, after all, are the \nmeans by which nature regulates this visible realm of hers: \nclear skies follow cloudy ; after the calm comes the storm; \nthe winds take turns to blow ; day succeeds night ; while \npart of the heavens is in the ascendant, another is sinking. It is \nby means of opposites that eternity endures. \nThis is the law to which our minds are needing to be \nreconciled. This is the law they should be following and \nobeying. They shoul d assume that whatever happens was \nbound to happen and refrain from railing at nature. One can \ndo nothing better than endure what cannot be cured and \nattend uncomplainingly the God at whose instance all things \ncome about. It is a poor soldier that follows his commander \ngrumbling. So let us receive our orders readily and cheerfully, \nand not desert the ranks along the march - the march of this \nglorious fabric of creation in which everything we shall \nsuffer is a strand. And let us address Jupiter, whose guiding \nhand directs this mighty work, in the way our own Cleanthes \ndid, in some most expressive lines which I may perhaps be \npardoned for translating in view of the example set here by \nthat master of expressiveness, Cicero. If you like them, so \nmuch the better; if not, you will at least know that I was \nfollowing Cicero's example. \n199\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC \nLead me, Master of the soaring vault \nOf Heaven, lead me, Father, where you wilL \nI stand here prompt and eager to obey. \nAnd ev'n suppose I were unwilling, still \nI should attend you and know suff ering, \nDishonourably and grwnbling, when I might \nHave done so and been good � well.

The more the mind takes in the more it \nex!>ands. \nI remember a piece of advice which Attalus gave me in \nthe days when I practically laid siege to his lecture hall, \nalways first to arrive and last to go, and would draw him \ninto a discussion of some point or other even when he was \nout taking a walk, for he was always readily available to his \nstudents, not just accessible. 'A person teaching and a person \nlearning,' he said, 'should have the same end in view: the \nimprovement of the latter.' A person who goes to a philo­\nsopher should carry away with him something or other of \nvalue every day; he should return home a sounder man or at \nleast more capable of becoming one. And he will : for the \npower of philosophy is such that she helps not only those \nwho devote themselves to her but also those who come into \ncontact with her. A person going out into the sun, whether \nor not this is what he is going out for, will acquire a tan. \nCustomers who sit around rather too long in· a shop selling \nperfumes carry the scent of the place away with them. And \npeople who have been with a philosopher are bound to have \nderived from it something of benefit even to the inattentive. \nNote that I say the inattentive, not the hostile. \n'That's all very well, but don't we all know certain people \nwho have sat at a philosopher's feet year after year without \nacquiring even a semblance of wisdom?' Of course I do -\npersevering, conscientious people, too. I prefer to call them a \nphilosopher's squatters, not students. Some come not to \nlearn �ut just to hear him, in the same way as we're drawn to a \ntheatre, for the sake of entertainment, to treat our ears to a \nplay, or music, or an address. You'll find that a large propor-\n201\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC cvm, 6 \ntion of the philosopher's audience is made up of this element, \nwhich regards his lecture-hall as a place oflodging for periods \nof leisure. They're not concerned to rid themselves of any \nfaults there, or acquire any rule of life by which to test their \ncharacters, but simply to enjoy to the full the pleasures the \near has to offer. Admittedly some of them acfually come with \nn�tebooks, but with a view to recording not the content of \nthe lecture, but words from it - to be passed on to others with \nthe same lack of profit to the hearer as they themselves \nderived from hearing them. Some of them are stirred by the \nnoble sentiments they hear ; their faces and spirits light up and \nthey enter into the emotions of the speaker, going into a \ntransport just like the eunuch priests who work themselves \ninto a frenzy, to order, at the sound of a Phrygian flute. \nThey are captivated and aroused not by a din of empty words, \nbut by the splendour of the actual content of the speaker's \nword� - any expression of bold or spirited de£i.ance of death \nor fortune making you keen to translate what you've heard \ninto action straight away. They are deeply affected by the \nwords and become the persons they are told to be - or would \nif the impression on their minds were to last, if this magni£i.­\ncent enthusi�sm were not immediately intercepted by that \ndiscourager of noble conduct, the crowd : very few succeed \nin getting home in the same frame of mind. \nIt is easy enough to arouse in a listener a desire for what is \nhonourable; for in every one of us nature has laid the founda­\ntions or sown the seeds of the virtues. We are born to them \nall, all of us, and when a person comes along with the necessary \nstimulus, then those qualities of the personality are awakened, \nso to speak, from their slumber.

For 'the constricting requirements of \nverse,' as Cleanthes wed to say, 'give one's meaning all the \ngreater force, in the same way as one's breath produces a far \ngreater noise when it is channelled through a trumpet's \nlong and narrow tube before its fmal expulsion through the \nwidening opening at the end.'

For I started out on it all with tremendous \nenergy and enthusiasm, and later, after my return to public \nlife, I managed to retain a few of the principles as regards \nwhich I had made this promising beginning. This is how I \ncame to give up oysters and mushrooms for the rest of my \nlife (for they are not really food to us but titbits which induce \npeople who have already had as much as they can take to go \non eating - the object most desired by gluttons and others \nwho stuff themselves with more than they can hold - being \nitems which will come up again as easily as they go down). \nThis too is why throughout life I have always abstained from \nusing scent, as the best smell a body can have is no smell at all. \nThis is why no wine ever fmds its way into my stomach. \nThis is the reason for my life- long avoidance of hot baths, \nbelieving as I do that it is effeminate as well as pointless to \nstew one's body and exhaust it with continual sweating. Some \nother things to which I once said good-bye have made their \nreapp earance, but nevertheless, in these cases in which I have \nceased to practise total abstinence, I succeed in observing a \nlimit, which is something hardly more than a step removed \nfrom total abstinence (and even perhaps more difficult- with \nsome things less effort of will is required to cut them out \naltogether than to have recourse to them in moderation). \nNow that I've started disclosing to you how much greater \nmy enthusiasm was in taking up philosophy as a young man \nthan it is when it comes to keeping it up in my old age, I \nshan't be ashamed to confess the passionate feelings which \nPythagoras inspired in me. Sotion used to tell us why Pytha­\ngoras, and later Sextius, was a vegetarian. Each had a quite \ndifferent reason, but each was a striking one. Sextius believed \nthat man had enough food to sustain him without shedding \nblood, and that when men took this tearing of flesh · so far \nthat it became a pleasure a habit of cruelty was formed. He \n205\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC cvm, IS \nargued in addition that the scope for people's extravagance \nwas in any case something that should be reduced; and he \ngave reasons for inferring that variety of diet was incompatible \nwith our physical make-up and inimical to health. Pythagoras, \non the other hand, maintained that all creatures were inter­\nrdated and that there was a system of exchange of souls \ninvolving transmigration from one bodily form to another. \nIf we are to believe Pythagoras, no soul ever undergoes \ndeath, or even a suspension of its existence except perhaps for \nthe actual moment of transfusion into another body. This \nis not the moment for inquiring by what stages or at what \npoint a soul completes its wanderings through a succession \nof other habitations and reverts to human form. It is enough \nfor our present purposes that he has instilled into people a \ndread of committing the crime of parricide, in view of the \npossibility that they might, all unknowing, come across the \nsoul of an ancestor and with knife or teeth do it dreadful \noutrage, assuming that the spirit of a relative might · be \nlodging in the flesh concerned. Mter setting out this theory \nand supplementing it with arguments of his own, Sotion \nwould say, 'You cannot accept the idea of souls being \nassigned to one body af ter another, and the notion that what \nwe call death is only a move to another home? You cannot \naccept that the soul which was once that of a man may \nsojourn in wild beasts, or in our own domestic animals, or in \nthe creatures of the deep? You cannot accept that nothing \never perishes on this earth, mstead merely undergoing a \nchange in its whereabouts? And that the animal world, not \njust the heavenly bodies that revolve in their unalterable \ntracks, moves in cycles, with its souls propelled along an \norbital path of their own? Well, the fact that these ideas are \nones which have been accepted by great men should make you \nsuspend judgement. You should preserve an open mind on \nthe whole subject anyway. For if these ideas are corr ect, to \n206\n\f\nCVDI, 24 LETTER CVIII \nabstain from eating the fiesh of animals will mean guiltl ess­\nness ; and even if they are not, it will still mean frugal living. \nWhat do you lose by believing in it all? All I am depriVing \nyou ofis what the lions and the vultures fe ed on.' \nFired by this teaching I became a vegetarian, and by the \ntime a year had gone by was finding it an enjoyable as well \nas an easy habit. I was beginning to fe el that my mind was \nmore active as a result of it - though I would not take my \noath to you now that it really was. I suppose you want to \nknow how I came to give up the practice. Well, my years \nas a young man coincided with the early part of Tiberius' \nreign, when certain religious cults of fo reign origin were \nbeing promoted, and among other things abstinence fr om \ncertain kinds of animal fo od was regarded as evidence of \nadherence to such superstitions. So at the request of my fa ther, \nwho did not really fe ar my being prosecuted, but who \ndetested philosophy, I resumed my normal habits. And in \nfa ct he had little difficulty in persuading me to adopt a fu ller \ndiet. Another thing, though, which Attalus used to recom­\nmend was a hard mattress ; and that is the kind I still use even \nin my old age, the kind which shows no trace of a body \nhaving slept on it. I tell you all this just to show you the \ntremendous enthusiasm with which the merest beginner will \nset about attaining the very highest goals provided someone \ngives him the necessary prompting and encouragement. \nThings tend, in fa ct, to go wrong; part of the blame lies on \nthe teachers of philosophy, who today teach us how to argue \ninstead of how to live, part on their students, who come to \nthe teachers in the ftrst place with a view to developing not \ntheir character but their intellect. The result has been the \ntransf ormation of philosophy, the study of wisdom, into \nphilology, the study of words. \nThe object which we have in view, af ter all, makes a \ngreat deal of diff erence to the manner in which we appro ach \n207\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC cvm, 2.4 \nany sub ject.

No, his purpose is to note that Virgil invariably \nuses this word 'fli es' whenever he speaks of the swift passage \nof time. \nLif e's finest days, for us poor human beings, \nFly first; the siclmesses and suff erings, \nA bleak old age, the matching hand \nImplacable of merciless death, creep near.t \nIt is the person with philosophy in his mind who takes these \nwords in the way they are meant to be taken.

He is also telling us that \nthe finest ones are the first to be borne away.

No, his comment is that \nVirgil constantly couples 1 sicknesses ' and 1 old age ' (and not \nwithout good reason, I can tell you: I should describe old \nage itself as a kind of incurable sickness). The scholar further \nremarks on the epithet attached to old age, pointing out that \nthe poet speaks in the passage quoted of 1 bleak old age ' and \nin another passage writes \nWhere dwell wan Sicknesses and bleak Old Age.* \n*A eneid, VI :27S· \n209\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC cvm, 29 \nThere is nothing particularly surprising about this way \nwhich everyone has of deriving material for his own indi­\nvidual interests from identical subject-matter. In one and the \nsame meadow the cow looks for grass, the dog for a hare and \nthe stork for a lizard. When a commentator, a literary man \nand a devotee of philosophy pick up Cicero's book The \nState, each directs his attention in different directions. The \nphilosopher finds it astonishing that so much could have \nbeen said in it by way of criticism of justice. The commenta­\ntor, coming to the very same reading matter, inserts this \nsort offootnote: 'There are two Roman kings one of whom \nhas no father and another no mother, the mother of Servius \nbeing a matter on which there is uncertainty, and Ancus, \nthe grandson of Numa, having no father on record.' He \nobserves further that 't he man to whom we give the title \nDictator and read about in the history books under the same \nname was called the Master of the Commons by the early \nRomans ; this title survives to the present day in the augural \nrecords, and the fact that the person appointed by him as his \ndeputy was known as the Master of the Knights is evidence \nthat this is correct.' He similarly observes that 'Romulus \ndied during an eclipse of the sun'; that 't he right of appeal to \nthe Commons ·was recognized as early as the period of the \nmonarchy; there is authority for this in the pontifical records, \nin the opinion of a number of scholars, in particular Fenes­\ntella.' When the literary scholar goes through the same book, \nthe first thing he records in his notebook is Cicero's use of \nreapse for re ipse, and sepse likewise for se ipse. He then goes \non to examine changes in usage over the years. Where, for \nexample, Cicero uses the expression: 'Since we have been \ncalled back right from the CJJlx by this interruption of his', \nhe notes that the calx was the name which the old Romans \ngave to the finishing line in the stadium that we nowadays \ncall the creta. The next thing he does is assemble lines \n210\n\f\ncvm, 36 LBTTBR CVIU \nfrom Enniw, and in particular those referring to Scipio of \nAfrica: \nNone, fo e nor Roman, can assess the value \nOfh ls succour and do justice to his fe ats.* \nFrom this passage the scholar claims to deduce that the word \n's uccour' to the early Romans signified the rendering not \nmerely of assistance but of actual services, Enniw saying that \nno one, foe or Roman, was capable of assessing the value of \nthe services Scipio rendered Rome. Next he congratulates \nhimself on discovering the source from which Virgil chose to \ntake the following : \nAbove whose head the mighty gates of heaven \nThunder.t \nHe tells w that Ennius filched the idea from Homer and that \nVirgil filched it from Ennius, there being a couplet of Enniw \n(preserved in this very work of Cicero's I was mentioning, \nThe State) which reads \nIf any man may rise to heaven's levels, \nTo me, alone, lie open heaven's huge gateS. \nBut enough, or before I know where I am I shall be slip­\nping into the scholar's or commentator's shoes myself. My \nadvice is really. this : what we hear the philosophers saying \nand what we find in their writings should be applied in our \npursuit of the happy lif e. We should hunt out the helpful \npieces of teaching, and the spirited and noble-minded sayings \nwhich are capable of immediate practical application - not \nfar-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors \nand figures of speech - and learn them so well that words \nbecome works.

Maecenas' greatest claim to glory is regarded as \nhaving been his clemency: he spared the sword, refrained \nfrom bloodshed and showed his power only in his defiance \nof convention. But he has spoilt this very claim of his by these \nmonstrous stylistic frolics; for it becomes apparent that he \nwas not a mild man but a soft one. That perplexing word \norder, those transpositions of words and those startling \nideas which have indeed the quality of greatness in them but \nwhich lose all their effect in the expression, will make it \n. obvious to anyone that his head was turned by overmuch \nprosperity. \nIt is a fault which is sometimes that of the man and some­\ntimes that of the age. Where prosperity has spread luxury \nover a wide area of society, people start by paying closer \nattention to their personal turnout. The next thing that \nengages people's energies is furniture. Then pains are devoted \nto the houses themselves, so as to have them running out over \nbroad expanses of territory, to have the walls glowing with \nmarble shipped from overseas and the ceilings picked out in \ngold, to have the floors shining with a lustre matching the \npanels overhead. Splendour then moves on to the table, \nwhere praise is courted through the medium of novelty and \nvariations in the accustomed order of dishes, making what \nnormally rounds off a meal the first course and giving people \nas they go what they used before to be given on arrival. Once \na person's spirit has acquired the habit of disdaining what is \ncustomary and regards the usual as banal, it starts looking for \nnovelty in its methods of expression as well. At one moment \nit will disinter and revive archaic or obsolete expressions; at \nanother it will coin new, unheard of expressions and give a \nword a new form ; at another - this is something that has \nbecome very conunon recently - the bold and frequent use of \n2IS\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC CXJV, 10 \nmetaphor passes for good style. There are some who cut their \nthoughts short and hope to win acclaim by making their \nmeaning elusive, giving their audience a mere hint of it; there \nare others who stretch them out, reluctant to let them go; \nthere are others still who do not merely fall into a defect of \nstyle (which is something that is inevitable if one is striving for \nany lofty eff ect), but have a passion for the defect for its own \nsake. \nSo wherever you notice that a corrupt style is in general \nfavour, you may be certain that in that society people's \ncharacters as well have deviated from the true path. In the \nsame way as extravagance in dress and entertaining are indica­\ntions of a diseased community, so an aberrant literary style, \nprovided it is widespread, shows that the spirit (from which \npeople's words derive) has also come to grie£ And in fact \nyou need feel no surprise at the way corrupt work finds \npopularity not merely with the common bystander but with \nyour relatively cultivated audience: the distinction between \nthese two classes of critic is more one of dress than of dis­\ncernment. What you might find more surprising is the fact \nthat they do not confme themselves to admiring passages that \ncontain defects, but admire the actual defects themselves as \nwell. The .former thing has been the case all through history -\nno genius that ever won acclaim did so without a measure of \nindulgence. Name me any man you like who had a cele­\nbrated reputation, and I'll tell you what the age he lived in \nforgave him, what it turned a blind eye to in his work. I'll \nshow you plenty of stylists whose faults never did them any \nharm and some who were actually helped by them. I'll even \nsay this : I could show you some men of the highest renown. \nmen held up as objects of wonder and admiration, in whose \ncase to amend their faults would be to destroy them, their \nfaults being so inextricably bound up with their virtues. \nBesides, there are no fixed rules of style. They are governed \n2.16\n\f\nCXIV, 16 LETTER CXIV \nby the usage of society and usage never stands still for �y \nlength of time. Many speakers hark back to earlier centuries \nfor their vocabulary, talking in the language of the Twelve \nTables.* Gracchus, Crassus and Curio are too polished and \nmodem for them. They go right back to Appius and Corun­\ncanius. Others, by contrast, in seeking to conf me themselves \nto familiar, everyday expressions, slip into an undistinguished \nmanner. Both these practices, in their different ways, are \ndebased style (quite as much so as the rejection of any expres­\nsion that is not high-sounding, florid and poetical, avoiding \nthe indispensable expressions in normal use). The one is as \nmuch a fault as the other, in my view, the first paying undue \nattention to itself and the second unduly neglecting itsel£ \nThe former removes the hair from its legs as well , the latter \nnot even from its armpits. \nLet us tum our attention to composition. How many \nspecies of fault can I show you where this is concerned? Some \nlike it broken and uneven, and go out of their way to dis­\narrange any passage with a relatively smooth and even flow. \nThey want every transition to ·c ome with a jolt, and see \nvirility and forcefulness in a style the irregularities of which \njar the ear. With some other literary figures it is not a case \nof composition but of setting words to melodies, so sweetly, \nsoftly do they glide along. What shall I say about the kind in \nwhich words are held back and keep u5 waiting for a long \ntime before they make their reluctant appearance right at \nthe end of the period? What of that, like Cicero's, which \nmoves to its conclusion in a leisurely fashion, in a gentle and \n* A set of tablets dating from 4S I-4SO B. c., which record a basic code \nof laws and were the earliest piece of Latin writing known to the \nRomans. \nIt may be noted here that in this letter Seneca sees or draws no \ndistinction between rules applying to literature and rules applying to \noratory. \n217\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC oav, 16 \ndelayed indine, and unvaryingly true to its customary \nrhythm ? \nIn the field of the epigram, too, faults comprise a tameness \nand childishness, or a boldness and daring that oversteps the \nbounds of decency, or a richness that has a cloying quality, \nor a barrenness in the outcome, an ineffectiveness, a ringing \nquality and nothing more. \nThese faults are introduced by some individual dominat­\ning letters at the time, are copied by the rest and handed on \nfrom one person to another. Thus in Sallust's heyday abruptly \nterminated sentences,. unexpectedly sudden endings and a \nbrevity carried to the point of obscurity passed for a polished \nstyle. Lucius Arruntius, the historian of the Punic War and \na man of unusual simplicity of char acter, was a follower of \nSallust and strove after that kind of style. 'By means of \nmoney he procured an army ', hired one, in other words, is \nan expression found in Sallust. Arruntius took a fancy to \nthis expression 'p rocured ' and found a place for it on every \npage, saying in one passage: 'They procured our rout ', in \nanother : 'King Hiero of Syracuse procured a war ', and in \nanother : 'This news procured the surrender of the people of \nPanormus to the Romans.' These are merely by way of \ngiving you samples of the practice - the whole book is rif e \nwith them.� What was occasional in Sallust is of frequent, \nalmost inc�sant occurr ence in Arruntius, which is easily \nenough explained, for whereas Sallust hit on such expressions \nArru ntius cultivated them. You can see what the result is \nwhen some writer's fault is taken as a model. Sallust spoke \nof 'w intry rai ns '. Arruntius, in the first book of The Punic \nWar, says: 'S uddenly the weather was wintry.' In another \nplace, when he wants to describe a particular year as having \nbeen a cold one, he says: 'The whole year was wintry. ' In \nanother passage he writes : 'From there he despatched sixty \ntran sport vessels, lightly laden apart from troops and essential \n2.18\n\f\nCXIV,22 LETTER CXIV \ncrew, in spite of a wintry northerly gale.' He drags the word \nin constantly, in every conceivable place. Sallust at one point \nwrites : 'S eeking, amid civil war, the plaudits of rectitude and \nintegrity '. Arruntius was unable to restrain himself fr om in­\nserting right at the beginning of his first book mention of \nRegulus' tremendous 'plaudits '. \nNow these fa ults, and others like them, stamped on a \nwriter's style by imitation, are not themselves evidence of \nextravagant ways or corrupt attitudes. For the things upon \nwhich you base any judgement on a person's psychology must \nbe things peculiar to himself , things that spring fr om his own \nnature, a hot-tempered man having a hot-tempered style, an \nemotional man an over-excited one, a self -indulgent man a \nsof t and flabby one and so on. And the last is the manner one \nobserves adopted by the sort of person who has his beard \nplucked out, or has it plucked out in parts, who keeps him­\nself close-shaven and smooth around his lips but leaves the \nrest of it to grow, who wears cloaks in flamboyant colours, \nwho wears a diaphanous robe, who is reluctant to do anything \nthat might escape people's attention, who provokes and \ncourts such attention and so long as he is looked at does not \nmind whether it is with disapproval . Such is the manner of \nMaecenas and every other writer whose styl istic errors are \nnot accidental but deliberate and calculated. It is something \nthat stems fr om a serious affliction of the spirit. When a \nperson is drinking his tongue only starts stumbling after his \nmental fa culties have succumbed and given way or broken \ndown. ·The same. applies with this drunkenness - what else \ncan one regard it as? - of style. No one suff ers from it unless \nhis spirit is unstable. \nSee, then, that the spirit is well looked after. Our thoughts \nand our words proceed fr om it. We derive our demeanour \nand expression and the very way we walk &om it. If the \nspirit is sound and healthy our style will be firm and fo rceful \n219"

All vices are at odds with nature, all abandon \nthe proper order of things. The whole ob ject of luxurious \nliving is the delight it takes in irregular ways and in not merely \ndeparting from the correct course but going to the farthest \npoint away from it, and in eventually even taking a stand \ndiametrically opposed to it. Don't you think it's living un­\nnaturally to drink without having eaten, taking liquor into an \nempty system and going on to dinner in a drunken state? \nYet this is a failing which is common among young people, \nwho cultivate their capacities to the point of drinking - swill­\ning would be a better description of it - in naked groups the \nmoment they're inside the doors of the public bath-house, \nevery now and then having a rub all over to get rid of the \nperspiration brought on by continually putting down the \npiping hot liquor. To them drinking af ter lunch or dinner is \na common habit, something only done by rural worthies and \npeople who don't know where the true pleasure lies: the wine \nthat gives a person undiluted enjoyment, they say, is the wine \nthat makes its way into his system unobstructed instead of \nswimming about in his food ; intoxication on an empty \nstomach is the kind that gratifies a man. \nDon't you think it's living unnaturally to exchange one's \nclothes for women's?* Is it not living unnaturally to aim at \nimparting the bloom of youth to a different period of life -\ncan there be a sorrier or crueller practice than that whereby \na boy is never, apparently, allowed to grow up into a man, \nin order that he may endure a man's attentions for as long \nas may be ? Won't even his years rescue him from the indig­\nnity his sex ought to have precluded? \nIs it not living unnaturally to hanker af ter roses during the \nwinter, and to force lilies in midwinter by taking the requisite \nsteps to change their environment and keeping up the \n*C ostly materials such as the silks mentioned in Letter XC, or the \ndiaphanous robe (perlucentem togam) disapproved of in Letter CXIV. \n222.\n\f\nCXXD, II LETTER CX XII \ntemperature with hot water heating? Is it not living un­\nnatmally to plant orchards on the top of towers, or to have a \nforest of trees waving in the wind on the roofs and ridges of \none's mansions, their roots springing at a height which it \nwould have been presumptuous for their crests to reach? Is \nit not living unnaturally to sink the foundations of hot baths \nin the sea and consider that one is not swimming in a refined \nfashion unless one's heated waters are exposed to the waves \nand storms? Having started to make a practice of desiring \neverything contrary to nature's habit, they finally end up by \nbreaking off relations with her altogether. 'It's daylight : time \nfor bed ! All's quiet: now for our exercises, now for a drive, \nnow for a meal! The daylight's getting nearer: time we had \nour dinner! No need to do as the. crowd does: to follow the \ncommon, well-worn path in lif e is a sordid way to behave. \nLet's leave the daytime to the generality of people. Let's \nhave early hours that are exclusively our own.' \nThis sort of person is to me as good as dead. After all, how \nfar can a person be from the grave, and an untimely one at \nthat, if he lives by the light of tapers and torches?* I can re­\ncall a great many people who led this kind of life at one time, \nwith a former praetor among them, too, Acilius Buta, the \nman who had squandered an enormous fortune which he had \ninherited, and when he confessed his impoverished state to \nthe emperor Tiberius was met with the remark, 'You have \nwoken up rather late.' Montanus Julius, a tolerably good \npoet, noted for his closeness to Tiberius and subsequent fall \nfrom favour, who u5ed to give public readings of his verse, \ntook great delight in working sunrises and sunsets into his \ncompositions. Hence the remark of Natta Pinarius when \nsomeone was expr essing disgust at the way Montanus' \nreading had continued for a whole day and declaring that his \nreadings weren't worth attending: 'I'm quite prepared to \n* Carried by custom at a child's funeraL \n223"

The reason why some people live in this sort of way \nis not that they think that night in itself has any special \nattraction, but that they get no pleasure out of anything which \nis usual ; apart fr om the fa ct that daylight is anathema to a \nbad conscience, a person who experiences a craving or a \ncontempt fo r things in proportion to their costliness or cheap­\nness looks down his nose at a fo rm of illumination which \ndoes not cost him anything. Moreover the man who lives \nextravagantly wants his manner of living to be on every­\nbody's lips as long as he is alive. He thinks he is wasting his \ntime if he iS not being talked about.

In a society as hectic as this one it takes more than \ncommon profligacy to get oneself talked about. \nI once heard that delightful story-teller, Albinovanus Pedo, \ndescribing how he had lived above Sextus Papinius. Papinius \nwas one of the daylight-shy fraternity. 'About nine o'clock \nat night I'd hear the sound of whips. \"What's he doing?\" I'd \nask, and be told he was inspecting the household accounts. \nAbout twelve I'd hear some �trenuous shouting. \"What's \nthat?\" I'd ask, and be told he was doing his voice exercises. \nAbout two I'd ask what the noise of wheels meant, and be \ntold he was off fo r his drive. About daybreak there would be a \nscurrying in all directions, a shouting fo r boys and a chaos \nof aetivity among stewards and kitchen staff. \"What is it?\" \nI'd ask, to be told he was out of his bath and had called fo r his \npre-dinner appetizer. \"His dinner, then;' it might be said, \n\"exceeded the capacity of his day.\" Far from it, fo r he lived \nin a highly economical fashion: all he used to bum up was \nthe night.' Hence Pedo's remark when some people were \ndescribing Papini us as being mean and grasping: 'I take it \nyou would describe him as being an artificial light addict as \nwell.' \nYou needn't be surprised to discover so much individuality \nwhere the vices are concerned. Vices are manif old, take \ncoWld ess diff erent fo rms and are incapable of classi.fi. cation. \nDevotion to what is right is simple, devotion to what is \nwrong is complex and admits of infinite variations. It is the \nsame with people's characters; in those who fo llow nature \nthey are straightf orward and uncomplicated, and diff er only \nin minor degree, while those that are warped are hopelessly \nat odds with the rest and equally at odds with themselves. \nBut the chief cause of this disease, in my opinion, is an attitude \nof disdain fo r a normal existence.

One used to think that the type of \nperson who spreads tales was as bad as any: but there are \npersons who spread vices. And ass ociation with them does a \nlot of damage. For even if its success is not immediate, it \nleaves a seed in the mind, and even after we've said goodbye \nto them, the evil follows us, to rear its head at some time or \nother in the future. In the same way as people who've been \nto a concert carry about with them the melody and haunting \nquality of pieces they've just heard, interfering with their \nthinking and preventing them from concentrating on any­\nthing serious, so the talk of snobs and parasites sticks in our \nears long after we've heard it. And it's far from easy to eradi­\ncate these haunting notes from the memory; they stay with \nus, lasting on and on, coming back to us every so often. This \nis why we must shut our ears against mischievous talk, and as \n228\n\f\ncxxm, 12 LETTER CXXII I \nsoon as it starts, too; once such talk has made its entry and \nbeen allowed inside, it becomes a good deal bolder. Even­\ntually it reaches the stage where it says that 'virtue and \nphilosophy and justice are just a lot of clap-trap. There's \nonly one way to be happy and that's to make the most of \nlif e. Eating, drinking, spending the money that's been lef t \nto you, that's what I call living - and that's what I call not \nfo rgetting that you've got to die some day, too. The days are \nslipping by, and lif e is running out on us, never to be restored. \nWhy should we hesitate? What's the point of being wise? \nOur years won't always allow us a lif e of pleasure, and in the \nmeantime while they're capable of it and clamouring fo r it, \nwhat's the point of thrusting austerity on them? Steal a \nmarch on death by disposing here and now of whatever he is \ngoing to take away. Look at you - no mistress, no boy to make \nyour mistress jealous. Every day you go out sober. You eat as \nif you had to submit a daily account book to your fa ther fo r \napproval. That's not living - that's merely being a part of the \nlif e enjoyed by other people. And what madness it is to deny \nyourself everything and so build up a fo rtune fo r your heir, \na policy which has the eff ect of actually turning a fr iend into \nan enemy, through the very amount that you're going to \nleave him, fo r the more he's going to get the more ·gleef ul \nhe's going to be at your death.

And we can achieve this if we realize that \nthere are two classes of things attracting or repelling us. We \nare attracted by wealth, pleasures, good looks, political ad­\nvancement and various other welcoming and enticing pros­\npects: we are repelled by exertion, death, pain, disgrace and \nlimited means. It follows that we need to train ourselves not to \ncrave for the former and not to be afraid of the latter. Let us \nfight the battle the other way round - retreat from the things \nthat attract us and rouse ourselves to meet the things that \nacrually attack us. You know the difference, Lucilius, between \nthe postures people adopt in climbing up and descending a \nmountain; those coming down a slope lean back, those \nmoving steeply upwards lean forward, for to tilt one's \nweight ahead of one when descending, and backwards when \nascending, is to be in league with what one has to contend \nwith. The path that leads to pleasures is the downward one: \nthe upward climb is the one that takes us to rugged and \ndifficult ground. Here let us throw our bodies forward, in \nthe other direction rein them back. \nAre you now supposing that the only people I consider a \ndanger to our ears are the ones who glorify pleasure and \ninculcate in us a dread (itself a fearsome thing) of pain? No, \nI think we're also damaged by the people who urge us under \ncolour of Stoic belief s to do what's wrong. They make much \nof our principle that only a man of wisdom and experience \ncan really love. 'H e's the one rrum with a natural gift for the \nart of love-making, then,' they say, 'and he's equally in the \nbest position to know all about drink and parties.

Scholars have tended to \nplace it in either s or 4 B. c., although some have put it as early as \n8 B. c. or as late as A. D. 4· \n2. A procurator was a kind of commissioner or agent, as a rule \nmainly concerned with revenue collection, although he might \nhold high administrative rank. Some provinces had a procurator \nas their governor. \n3· He wrote two handbooks on the subject for his sons. These, the \nSuasoriae and Controversiae, acquired a wide reputation and have \nsurvived to the present day. \n4. Antiquus rigor, as he calls it, writing to his mother (ad Helviam \nMatrem, I7.3) . \n.S· Letter LXXVIII.2. \n6. Pliny (Natural History, VI :6o ) speaks of Seneca's work on India as \nmentioning 6o rivers and I I 8 different races - an indication of the \nfacilities for research at Alexandria. \n7· Suetonius (Cali gula, 53) says the emperor disparagingly called \nhim a mere 'text-bc;>ok orator', his style 'sand without cement' \n(arena sine calcc). \n8. Dio, Roman History, LIX: I9. \n9. A fragment of Suetonius (as quoted by the scholiast on Juvenal, \nSatires, V: I 09) states that Seneca was exiled on the pretext of his \nbeing linked with the scandalous love affairs of Julia Livilla \n(quasi conscius adulteriorum Juliae). Dio (Roman History, LX: 8) \ntoo speaks as if Seneca was only an incidental victim, the accusa­\ntion originating in Messalina's jealousy of Julia (a sister of \nAgrippina, and apparently a beautiful and cultivated woman). \nIO. Tacitus, Annals, XIII :8. \nn. ibid., XIII:3. \n12. 'For five years Nero was so great a ruler, from the point of view of \nRome's development and progress, that Trajan's frequent claim \n233\n\f\nLETTERS PROM A STOIC \nthat no emperor came near Nero in this five year period can be \nfully justified ', to paraphrase the words of Aurelius Victor, de \nCaesaribus, s . ii (Nero .•. quinquennium tJJmen tantus fuit, agenda \nurbe maxima, uti merito Trajanus saepius testaretur procul dilf ere \ncunctos principes Neronis quinquennio) .

Grimal, The Civilization of Rome. Seneca's American 'translator, \nGwrunere, suggests that this anomalous state of affairs may be \nseen as an experiment with Plato's ideal of philosopher-kingship, \nand one which also took account of the conditions of the rime, \nstriking a balance between the dangers of one-man rule (of which \nthe recent reign of Caligula was a vivid illust ration) and the \nimpossibility of a return to the free elections and near anarchy of \nthe Republic ; he describes the result as a kind of cabinet system \nin which Seneca was the cabinet. \n19. Tacitus, Annals, XIII:42 and Dio, Roman History, LXI: 10 are our \nsources for the sort of thing that was becoming gossip. \n20. Satires, X: 16. Tacitus (Annals, XV: 64) also used this word \npraedives, 'i mmensely wealthy', of Seneca, who was almost \ncertainly a millionaire, in terms of sterling, four or five rimes \nover. Juvenal incidentally speaks of his generosity with his \nmoney as if it was well known even after he was dead (Satires, \nV: 109). \n21. Roman History, LX :32. This historian states that Seneca's sudden \nrecall, backed by force, of enormous sums of money which he \nhad lent to leading natives of the recently conquered province of \nBritain was a cause of the rising of Buduica or Boudicca \n(' Boadicea ') in A. D. 61. \n22. Res Rustica, III : 3. 3. \n23. In Letters CVlii and LXXXIII, for example. In Letter LXXXVll \n2.34\n\f\nNOTES \nhe describes an expedition undertaken by himself and a close \nfriend {Caesonius Maximus, himself a man who had had a \ndistinguished career) in a mulcxart with the simplest of sleeping \nequipment and only figs or bread to eat; he speaks of having \nhad 'a blissful two days', but regrets to report that he could not \nhelp blushing whenever they met people travelling in greater \nstyle (cf. p. 228) • \n.2.4. Roman History, LXI: 18. Dio, usually hostile to Seneca, reports \n'many reliable sources' as saying that Seneca helped incite Nero \nto liquidate Agrippina (Roman History, LXI : 12). \nThe murder, its significance, and the possibility {remote) of \nSeneca's complicity are discussed by S. J. Batomsky and P. J. \nBicknell in Theoria, volume 19 (1962) pp. 3H and volume 21 \n(1963) pp. 42-5 (University ofNatal Press). \n25. Annals, XIV: p.f. \n26. ibid., XV : 45· \n27. ibid., XV:6 s. \n28. ibid., XV:�. The passage is given on p. 243 in Michael \nGrant's translation, from the Penguin Classics Tacitus: The \nAnnals of Imperial Rome. It incidentally illustrates (like the \nbeginning of Letter CIV) the close affection between him and his \nyoung second wife. There is a rather touching mention in his \ntreatise entitled Anger of how his first wife, after the light was \nout for the night, would keep quiet while he made his customary \nreview of everything· he had done or said in the course of the \nday (De Ira, III : 36). \n29. Augustine (De Civitate Dei, VI: 10) says that Seneca quod culpabat \nadorabat, 'worshipped the very things he criticized'. Milton \nspeaks of him as 'i n his books a philosopher'. La Rochefoucauld, \nfor the frontispiece of an edition of his Rljlexions, has him por­\ntrayed with villainous features from which a figure of Cupid \nrepresenting L'Amour de Ia Venti has just stripped a mask. of \nvirtuous amiability. \n30. Natural History, XIV: 51. \n235\n\f\nLETTERS FROM A STOIC \nSENECA AND PHILOSOPHY \n3 I. Letter LXII. \n32. The Stoics were considered by many as contumaces .•. ac refractarios, \ncontemptores magistratuum aut regum eorumve per quos publica \nadministrantur, 'hostile to authority and resistant to discipline, \ndisdainful ofkings, magistrates or public officials' (Letter LXXIII). \nThere are a number of cases of Stoics whose lack of respect for \nemperors earned them martyrdom. \n33. Letter XL VIII. \n34. Letter LVII. Compare Letter VI. \n35. A few examples of sayings or ideas so paralleled are those of \nI Cor. iii, I6 (God's 'indwelling presence' - c£ Letter XLI, \ninit.) ; I Tim. vi, IO ('money the root of all evil') ; Job i, 2I (we \ncame into the world naked and go out of it naked, and 'the Lord \ngave, and the Lord hath taken away'); Rom. xii, 5, IO (we are mem­\nbers of one body, and 'Be kindly ajfectioned one to another with \nbrotherly love', etc.); Aas xvii, 29 (God is not like any gold or \nsilver image); Htb. iv, I3 (not even thoughts are hidden from God \n- cf. Letter LXXXIII, intt.) ; Matt. v, 45 (the sun rises on the \nwicked as well); and (as translated in the New English Bible} \nEph. v, I (imitate, try to be like God). They do not lend any real \nsupport to theories that Seneca was influenced by St Paul or by \nChristian slaves in his own household. \n36. Dr Basore. \n37· Letter LXXV. C£ 'Philosophy teaches us to act, not to talk' \n(Letter XX). \nSENECA AND LI TERATURE \n38. The introduction to the translation Four Tragedi£s and Octavia by \nE. F. Watling (Penguin Classics) discusses generally the faults of \nSenecan drama and the question whether it was performable. \n39· See, for example, Duff, Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age. \n40. There are isolated passages of magnificent writing, poetic or \npolemic, for example in parts of Letters XC and CIV. \n4I. For instance in Letters XC, XCIV and XCV. The last two \n.2.J6\n\f\nNOTES \nincidentally (which discuss the question whether, in order to \nenable them to know what is the right thing to do in a given \nsituation, people need a general 'd octrine' or a sufficient number \nof 'p recepts', or both) are sufficient answer in themselves to \ncritics who have said that Seneca is incapable of setting out a \nsustained, continuous, consistent argument. One might quote \nhere the opinions of Coleridge: 'Y ou may get a motto for every \nsect in religion, but nothing is ever thought out by him' , and \nQuintilian: 'As a philosopher he was rather slipshod, though a \nmagnificent censor of moral faults ' (in philosophia parum Jiligens, \negregius tamen vitiorum insectator, Institutio Oratoria, X :1.129). \n42. In Letters CXV (e.g. quaere quid scribas, non quemadmodum, \n'consider what, not how you should write'), C and elsewhere. \n43. Duff, Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age. \n44· lnstitutio Oratoria, X: 1.12 5-3 I forms throughout an interesting \nappraisal of Seneca by a famous scholar, adv6cate and teacher \nwho died only thirty years or so after him. A short, late seven­\nteenth-century cormnent on Seneca's style is that to be found in \nAubrey's Lives: 'D r Kettle was wont to say that \"S eneca writes, \nas a boare does pissc \", scilicet, by jirkes.' \n45· Oratio certam regulam non habet, since fashion or usage (consuetudo) \nis constantly altering the rules (Letter CXIV). \n46. Aulus Gellius, to give another example, described his language as \n'trite and commonplace' (vulgaria et protrita), his learning as being \n'of a very ordinary, low-brow character' (vernacula et plebeia). \n47. Dante quotes him frequently and ranks him (with Cicero) after \nVirgil only in the I�{emo. Chaucer, in the Parson's Tale, classes \nSeneca with St Paul, Solomon and St Augustine. Petrarch \nmodelled his letters on Seneca's, which he knew intimately. The \nUniversity ofPiacenza was actually endowed with a Professor of \nSeneca. \n48. Erasmus put many quotations from Seneca's prose works into an \nanthology known as the Adagia which has been supposed to be \nthe source of most of the imitations or borrowings found in \nElizabethan writers. \n49. Montaigne (Essays, !: 26) says 'I have never got to grips with a \nsingle solid book, apart from Plutarch and Seneca. from whom \n23 7"

G. William­\nson's The Senecan Amble (Chicago, 195 1) and R. G.

    "raw_text": "APPEND IX \nTacitus' account of Seneca's death (Annals, XV: 60-64) \nNERo asked if Seneca was preparing for suicide. Gavius Silvanus \nreplied that he had noticed no signs of fear or sadness in his words or \nfeatures. So Silvanus was ordered to go back and notify the death­\nsentence. According to one source, he did not return by the way he \nhad come but made a detour to visit the commander of the Guard, \nFaenius Rufus; he showed Faenius the emperor's orders asking if he \nshould obey them; and Faenius, with that ineluctable weakness \nwhich they all revealed, told him to obey. For Silvanus was himself \none of the conspirators - and now he was adding to the crimes \nwhich he had conspired to avenge. But he shirked communicating \nor witnessing the atrocity. Instead he sent in one of his staff-officers \nto tell Seneca he must die. \nUnperturbed, Seneca asked for his will. But the officer refused. \nThen Seneca turned to his friends. 'Being forbidden ', he said, 'to \nshow gratitude for your services, I leave you my one remaining \npossession, and my best: the pattern of my life. If you remember it, \nyour devoted friendship will be rewarded by a name for virtuous \naccomplishments.' As he talked - and sometimes in sterner and more \nimperative terms - he checked their tears and sought to revive their \ncourage. Where had their philosophy gone, he asked, and that \nresolution against impending misf ortunes which they had devised \nover so many years? 'S urely nobody was unaware that Nero was \ncruel!' he added. 'After murdering his mother and brother, it only \nremained for him to kill his teacher and tutor.' \nThese words were evidently intended for public hearing. Then \nSeneca embraced his wife and, with a tenderness very different &om \nhis philosophical imperturbability, entreated her to moderate and \nset a term to her grief, and take just consolation, in her bereavement, \nfrom contemplating his well-spent life. Nevertheless, she insisted on \ndying with him, and demanded the executioner's stroke. Seneca did \nnot oppose her brave decision. Indeed, loving her wholeheartedly, \nhe was reluctant to leave her for ill-treatment. 'Solace in life was what \n243\n\f\nLBTTBRS PROM A STOIC \nI commended to you', he said. 'B ut you pref er death and glory. I \nwill not grudge your setting so fine an example. We can die with \nequal fo rtitude. But yours will be the nobler end.' \nThen, each with one incision ofthe blade, be and his wif e cut \ntheir arms. But Seneca's aged body, lean from austere living, released \nthe blood too slowly. So he also severed the veins in his ankles and \nbehind his knees. Exhausted by severe pain, he was afraid of weaken­\ning his wif e's endurance by betraying his agony- or oflosing his own \nself -possession at the sight of her suff erings. So be asked her to go \ninto another bedroom. But even in his last moment his eloquence \nremained. Summ oning secretaries, he dictated a dissertation. (It bas \nbeen published in his own words, so I sball refrain from para­\nphrasing it.) \nNero did not dislike Paulina personally. In order, theref ore, to \navoid increasing his ill-repute fo r cruelty, he ordered her suicide to \n\\x: averted. So on instructions from the soldiers, slaves and ex-slaves \nbandaged her arms and stopped the bleeding. She may have been \nunconscious. But discreditable versions are always popular, and some \ntook a diff erent view - that as long as she fe ared there was no appeas­\ning Nero, she coveted the distinction of dying with her husband, \nbut when better prospects appeared lif e's attractions got the better \nofher. She lived on fo r a fe w years, honourably loyal to her husband's \nmemory, with pallid fe atures and limbs which showed bow much \nvital blood she bad lost. \nMeanwhile Seneca's death was slow and lingering. Poison, such \nas was fo rmerly used to execute state criminals at Athens, bad long \nbeen prepared; and Seneca now entreated his well-tried doctor, who \nwas also an old friend, to supply it. But when it came, Seneca drank \nit without effect. For his limbs were already cold and numbed against \nthe poison's action. Finally he was placed in a bath of warm water. \nHe sprinkled a little of it on the attendant slaves, commenting that \nthis was his hbation to Jupiter. Then he was carried into a vapour­\nbath, where he suff ocated. His cremation was without ceremony, in \naccordance with his own instructions about his death - written at \nthe height ofhis wealth and power. \n(Translated by Miclulel Grant)"
