    "raw_text": "Author’s Note\nI tell stories that go back more than thirty years and do my best to describe those\nevents accurately. The people in the book identi\u0000ed by their \u0000rst and last names\nare real people. Those mentioned only by \u0000rst name are either composite\ncharacters or people whose names and identifying details have been changed.\nThe essence of their stories is factual.\n\f\nIntroduction\nBefore Your First Move\nWhen I \u0000rst watched Magnus, the documentary about Magnus Carlsen, I\ncouldn’t stop thinking about the parallels to business. Carlsen is a Norwegian\nchess prodigy who became a grand master at thirteen. Talk about a visionary; he\nis constantly thinking as many as \u0000fteen moves ahead. In doing so, he has the\nuncanny ability to predict (and control) what his opponents will do. I was also\nimpressed by his meticulous preparation. Because Carlsen has played the game in\nhis mind so many times before it actually happens, he is un\u0000appable in the heat\nof battle. Plus, he has to deal with something founders and CEOs face all the\ntime. He said, “If you want to get to the top, there’s always the risk that it will\nisolate you from other people.”\nAfter watching Magnus, I continued to think about how much successful\nentrepreneurs and chess masters have in common. It didn’t surprise me when I\nlearned that Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk started playing chess at a\nyoung age. “He’s able to see things more clearly in a way that no one else I know\nof can understand,” his brother, Kimbal, said. “There’s a thing in chess where\nyou can see twelve moves ahead if you’re a grand master. And in any particular\nsituation, Elon can see things twelve moves ahead.”\nThat quote about Musk put everything into perspective. Most people don’t\nthink more than one or two moves ahead. Those people are amateurs and \u0000ame\nout quickly in business. E\u0000ective strategy is about making a move and being\nprepared to launch another series of moves based on how the market or your\n\f\ncompetition reacts. You must think beyond your \u0000rst strike to execute an\ne\u0000ective strategy. When you start to get really good, you anticipate how others\nwill react and can deploy a series of moves that are nearly impossible to\ncounteract.\nThough business is a game of thinking several moves ahead, this is not a book\nabout chess. This book is about taking the vision and mindset of a chess master\nand applying it to business. In fact, you don’t even have to know anything about\nthe game. There aren’t any speci\u0000c chess examples in the pages that follow, but\nthere are plenty of examples of successful men and women who think like\nwinning chess players.\nPeople who don’t think more than one move ahead are driven by ego,\nemotion, and fear. Your top salesman threatens to quit if you don’t give him a\nraise. The emotional amateur responds by saying “Nobody threatens me” or\n“We don’t need him anyway.” The practical strategist, on the other hand, is\nplotting his next moves.\nThe same approach applies to parenting. Giving kids whatever they demand\n—whether it’s candy, an iPad, or permission to skip piano practice—feels\nfantastic. They smile and tell you how much they love you. You also know that\nthe alternative—an all-out tantrum during which venom and hatred will be\nhurled at you—will feel awful. This scenario shows you that, as with most\nbusiness decisions, one is clearly the easier choice; the other—which entails\nthinking \u0000ve moves ahead—is the more eﬀective choice.\nI wish somebody had taught me to think this way when I was transitioning\nfrom salesman to sales manager to founder to CEO. At every stage of my\ndevelopment, this kind of critical thinking would have saved me millions of\ndollars and dozens of panic attacks. When I re\u0000ect on how I went from a hot-\ntempered, insecure, cocky health club salesman to a strategic, self-aware,\ncon\u0000dent CEO, I see that the key was learning how to think at least \u0000ve moves\nahead.\nSome of you overachievers may be wondering why only \u0000ve moves ahead.\nThere are two reasons. First, \u0000ve moves is the sweet spot of thoughtful strategy\nand swift action. Though there may be times when you will want to think\nbeyond \u0000ve moves, such as at an annual o\u0000-site meeting or when you are"

    "raw_text": "analyzing a possible acquisition (or building a colony on Mars), thinking too\nmany moves ahead can lead to paralysis by analysis. Five moves is enough to\nmake sure you are anticipating future outcomes and seeing moves and\ncountermoves. The second reason is that, on a macro level, there are \u0000ve moves\nyou need to master to succeed in business. I’ve divided the book into these \u0000ve\nmoves to make sure you know exactly what you need to do to achieve success.\nThere are many things I can’t do. I’m six foot \u0000ve and 240 pounds but can’t\nplay basketball or throw a football. I can’t write code or rebuild an engine from\nscratch. But if there’s one thing I can do, it’s help entrepreneurs and C-suite\nexecutives put together a strategy to conquer a market. When I sit down in a\nboardroom with a founder or a CEO, we approach strategy as a game. The only\ndi\u0000erence between business and chess (or Monopoly or Final Fantasy, for that\nmatter) is that we’re playing for millions (or billions) of dollars instead of\nbragging rights. With this mindset, leaders learn how to create the strategies that\nposition them for growth.\nAs an adviser to executives and a guide to students and aspiring\nentrepreneurs, one of the most common questions I get is: Should I quit my job\nto start a business? Other frequent questions are: Should I raise money by giving\nup equity or issuing debt? How do I set up my compensation structure to\nattract and retain C-suite executives or a 1099-based sales team? Should I expand\nglobally now or wait until market conditions change?\nThe simple questions in business are binary. Their answer is either yes or no.\nThe trap is believing that all answers are binary. The answer to any question is\nactually a series of moves deployed in the proper sequence. “Experts” often make\nthings worse by giving yes or no answers as if everyone \u0000ts into the same box.\nThat’s why, as you’ll see, our \u0000rst move is \u0000guring out who you are and what you\nwant.\nThe other problem I see is a lack of planning. Enthusiasm can be powerful, as\nlong as it’s coupled with planning \u0000ve moves ahead. Too many people want to\nmake move number \u0000ve without \u0000rst going through the \u0000rst four moves.\nThere’s a sequence to it. To reach the next level, you have to shift from one-track\n(and one-move) thinking to seeing many moves ahead."

    "raw_text": "If you are clear that you want to be an entrepreneur, quitting your job may\nbe move four, or it could lead to a series of moves to create a lucrative position\nwithin your current company (becoming an intrapreneur, which we’ll cover in\nchapter 3). If you have a family and don’t have any savings, quitting your job is\nde\u0000nitely not move one. In fact, you may not ever have to quit your job to\nbecome exactly who you want to be. The information in this book applies to\npeople in all phases of life and at all levels of business. You may be a CFO who\nloves being a CFO or a freelancer who enjoys the variety and \u0000exibility of being a\n“solopreneur.” One of the things I love so much about business is that there’s a\npath for everyone—as long as you have self-awareness and the willingness to\nthink \u0000ve moves ahead.\nRegardless of which sequence \u0000ts your circumstances, what sets shrewd\nstrategists apart is their ability to anticipate. The best military leaders have a\nknack for planning several moves ahead. The top \u0000ghters know how to set up\ntheir opponent. They may be willing to lose round one because a move that\nseems to be working against them early in the \u0000ght is actually being used to bait\ntheir opponent into a mistake in a later round. World-class poker players do the\nsame thing, making a blu\u0000 and sacri\u0000cing chips early in the game to set into\nmotion a series of moves that will ultimately bust their opponent. And though\nwe don’t necessarily think of Warren Bu\u0000ett as a chess master, his sustained\nsuccess comes from his patient, strategic approach. Bu\u0000ett isn’t trying to win a\nparticular trade or even the quarter or year. He’s making a series of moves to win\nthe long game.\nNBA legend Kobe Bryant told me, less than six months before his tragic\ndeath, that when he was thirteen, he already knew he wanted to be one of the\ngreatest basketball players of all time. At that time he was the \u0000fty-sixth-ranked\nplayer in the nation. He created a hit list of all the names ahead of him until, \u0000ve\nyears later, he passed them all and became a \u0000rst-round pick right out of high\nschool. Rumor has it that Michael Jordan used playing for the 1992 US\nOlympic “Dream Team” as a way to learn the weaknesses of his teammates and\nuse those weaknesses against them when he returned to the NBA. Both of these\nplayers were master strategists who were always thinking at least \u0000ve moves"

You will need to think this way, too, especially if you plan on competing\nin your market and eventually dominating your industry.\nIn the pages that follow, I’ll give you everything you need to think like a master\nstrategist. I’m also going to show you how to:\n1. Di\u0000erentiate yourself and communicate your unique value\n2. Find investors and build a high valuation for a lucrative exit\n3. Attract top talent and design incentives to cultivate and keep them\n4. Maintain systems during rapid growth and staying power/sanity during chaos\n5. Process issues, make decisions, and e\u0000ectively solve problems\n6. Identify who you want to be and the legacy you will create\n7. Negotiate, sell, and strategize as if your life depended on it\nMaybe you picked up this book thinking that you lack the education or\nresources to build a business. Or you might be the person with a high IQ who\ncan’t make a decision to save your life because you’re always overthinking it. It\ndoesn’t matter where you start. If you have any doubt that someone can’t grow\nto be an entrepreneur, consider my story.\nAnyone who knew me growing up would have labeled me “least likely to\nsucceed.” You’re going to see how I went from a guy who couldn’t think ahead\nat all (and as a result had twenty-six credit cards with a total of $49,000 in debt)\nto a CEO. You’ll see how I founded PHP Agency, a \u0000nancial services marketing\ncompany with sixty-six agents in one o\u0000ce in Northridge, California, and, ten\nyears later, had grown it to more than \u0000fteen thousand agents with 120 o\u0000ces in\nforty-nine states and Puerto Rico.\nI’m proud of the fact that our agency is recognized for its unique diversity,\nmillennial culture, and social media presence. We did it in the life insurance\nindustry, which has a “boring” reputation. (The average life insurance agent is a\n\u0000fty-seven-year-old white man; our average agent is a thirty-four-year-old Latino\nwoman.) We haven’t been successful because of our connections or thanks to\nany good fortune. In fact, my personal background proves that entrepreneurs\ncan come from anywhere and don’t have any qualities that you don’t also\npossess.\n\f\nThe Least Likely CEO\nI grew up in Tehran, the capital of Iran. During the Iran-Iraq war in 1987, my\nfamily lived with the possibility of an attack at any moment. Even though I was\nonly eight, the sounds still stick with me. Every attack began with a siren, and\nthe sound alone could pierce your soul. Then a voice would warn of enemy\nplanes crossing the border. Finally, we would hear the whistling sound of bombs\nfalling through the air.\nAfter each whistle, we prayed that our shelter wouldn’t get hit. I remember\nsitting next to my parents, frightened beyond belief. Finally, my mother had had\nenough. She told my dad that if we didn’t leave the country, their son was going\nto get stuck and have to serve in the Iranian army. My dad realized that the surest\nway to fail would be to fail to act.\nMy sister, my parents, and I got into our white, two-door Renault and\nheaded toward Karaj, a city two hours from Tehran. To get there we had to cross\na bridge. Right after we crossed, there was a massive \u0000ash behind us. Dad told\nmy sister and me not to look back, but we couldn’t help ourselves. I wish we had\nlistened. When we turned around, we saw the devastation of a bomb that had\ndropped onto the bridge less than a hundred yards behind us—right after we\nhad crossed safely. I still have no words for it, other than to say that no one,\nmuch less two terri\u0000ed kids, should ever have to witness something like that.\nI can replay that moment in my head as if it were yesterday. Times like that\ncan break you, or they can build in you an amazing tolerance for pain and\nadversity. Somehow we managed to skirt disaster and escape. We lived in a\nrefugee camp for two years in Erlangen, Germany, before eventually moving to\nGlendale, California, on November 28, 1990. When we arrived in the United\nStates, I had just turned twelve, spoke little English, and couldn’t escape the\nhorrible mental images of \u0000eeing a war-ravaged country.\nThanks to my parents’ decision to make the right move in the face of life and\ndeath, I’m alive today, a proud US citizen with a thriving business and a\nbeautiful family of my own.\n\f\nWhen you learn to think \u0000ve moves ahead, it may seem as though you’re\nbecoming a mind reader. What’s actually happening is you’ve seen the moves so\nmany times that you can anticipate what your opponent is going to say or do\nnext. I bet you are wondering: Can I do this? Can I truly go from a person who\nlacks experience to someone who thinks strategically and builds an empire?\nYou might be saying, “But, Pat, you have the gift of gab. You have the\npedigree of an entrepreneur. You, Pat, are a lot smarter than I am.”\nSmarter than you? Really?\nConsider the following:\n1. I barely graduated high school. I had a 1.8 GPA, got 880 on my SATs (out of a possible 1,600),\nand never set foot inside a four-year college. I was constantly told by friends and relatives that I\nwould never amount to anything in life.\n2. You think I have the gift of gab? At age forty-one, I still get teased about my accent. As an\nimmigrant teenager, I was more scared of pronouncing certain words than I was of war. Words\nsuch as “Wednesday,” “island,” and “government” challenged me the most. That was when\nreruns of Gilligan’s Island made the TV show really popular. You can only imagine how I\npronounced both words—and how brutally I was teased for it.\n3. My parents divorced after they arrived in the United States. I lived mostly with my mom, who\nwas on welfare. Even though I was a tall kid who loved sports, I didn’t play any because my\nmom couldn’t a\u0000ord the $13.50 monthly membership fee for the YMCA.\n4. I enlisted in the army at age eighteen because I believed I had no other choice. At age twenty-\none, when those with the real brains were starting their careers, I was selling gym memberships\nat Bally Total Fitness.\nOn the one hand, it would seem as though I had no business beating the\nodds. On the other, it was those very challenges that fueled my success. Had it\nnot been for all the adversity I experienced, I wouldn’t have had such a strong\ndesire to succeed.\nLet’s get this straight right now: I cannot teach you desire. If you prefer to\navoid hard work, if you feel no desire to do something important with your life,\nthere’s not much I can do for you. This book is for people who are curious to\n\u0000nd out what their best looks like and are looking for the right strategies to help\nthem get there. They’re not just looking for motivation; they’re looking for\nproven strategies that work. They want to \u0000nd e\u0000ective formulas to speed up the\nprocess of getting to the next level. Does that sound like you?"

    "raw_text": "Speaking of formulas, I’ve been as diligent in looking for them as I’ve been in\nsharing them. Back in 2013, I started making videos about what worked for me\nin business. It was just me, my right-hand man, Mario, and a small Canon EOS\nRebel T3 camera (which is typically used only for still photography). We \u0000rst\ncalled those videos “Two Minutes with Pat” and put them on YouTube. Within\na year, we had sixty subscribers and changed the name to Valuetainment. Three\nyears later, we had 100,000 subscribers and created a reputation for producing\nuseful and practical content. In March 2020, we passed 2 million YouTube\nsubscribers. Along the way, I advised people from all walks of life. At our \u0000rst\nbig conference in May 2019, called the Vault, 600 entrepreneurs from 43\ncountries in 140 industries traveled to Dallas to attend. They ranged from small\nstart-ups to executives to a CEO running a business with top-line revenue of half\na billion dollars.\nWhy did people spend their hard-earned money to \u0000y halfway around the\nglobe to attend that conference? Why all those subscribers? It’s because all the\nphilosophies and strategies I’ve learned are transferable. You can easily\nunderstand them and put them to use immediately. Many of my followers began\ncalling themselves “Valuetainers” and seeing positive results. Though we’re not a\ntraditional business school like Harvard, Stanford, or Wharton, Valuetainment\nhas become a breeding ground for both successful executives and entrepreneurs\nworldwide.\nI \u0000rmly believe that entrepreneurship can solve most of the world’s problems,\nand I have learned from experience not only how it can be done but how to\nteach it to others. From my personal conversations to our group meetings to\ntense negotiations, I’m putting every bit of wisdom I have into this book because\nI’ve seen it work and know you can achieve similar success.\nThe Path to Achieving Your Goals in Business\nIn your hands is a complete playbook for accomplishing whatever vision you\ncreate. You’ll learn not only the skills required but also the mindset required.\nAlong the way, you’ll see what it takes to be a better leader and human being. By\n\f\nthe time you have studied all \u0000ve moves, you will have everything you need to\nachieve whatever type of success in business you are after. The \u0000ve moves are:\n1. Master Knowing Yourself\n2. Master the Ability to Reason\n3. Master Building the Right Team\n4. Master Strategy to Scale\n5. Master Power Plays\nMove 1 is about knowing yourself, a topic rarely talked about in business\ncircles. What you’ll see is that thinking ahead is impossible without self-\nawareness. With self-awareness, you gain the power of choice and control over\nyour actions. Above all, with the knowledge of who you want to be, you will\nknow which direction to take as well as why it matters.\nMove 2 is about the ability to reason. I’ll show you how to process issues\nand provide a methodology to deal with any decision you’ll face, no matter what\nthe stakes. No decision is black and white, and this section will teach you how to\nsee all the shades of gray and move forward decisively despite the uncertainty.\nMove 3 is about understanding others so you can build the right team\naround you—the team that will help you grow. Though you may view some of\nmy tactics as Machiavellian, at the heart of everything I do is leading people to\n\u0000nd the best in themselves. I do so by asking questions that uncover their\ndeepest desires. Just as I challenge people to understand themselves, I will\nchallenge you to understand your relationships. Building trust in employees and\npartners creates pro\u0000table alliances, speeds up all parts of your business, and\nhelps you sleep at night.\nMove 4 is about how to implement strategy to scale to create exponential\ngrowth. We’ll cover everything from how to raise capital to how to create rapid\ngrowth and how to hold people accountable for their actions. By the time you\nget to this section, you’ll be thinking like a seasoned CEO and learning how to\ngain—and maintain—momentum as well as how to create systems that allow\nyou to track and measure the key parts of your business.\nMove 5 is about power plays. We’ll discuss how you can beat the Goliath in\nyour industry. You’ll also see how to control your narrative and leverage social\nmedia to frame your story. You’ll learn about psychology and gain insider secrets\n\f\nfrom one of the most notorious business organizations in the world: the Mob\n(yes, the Mob—and you’ll soon see why!). We’ll close out with some incredible\nstories that show how winning entrepreneurs think \u0000ve moves ahead.\nEven though I have no formal education, I have read more than 1,500 business-\nrelated books. I was, and remain, obsessed with learning. I’ve squeezed every bit\nof wisdom out of these readings and applied it to my business. As Valuetainment\nstarted to take o\u0000, I was able to interview many brilliant minds and strategists. It\nhas served and continues to serve a dual purpose: I have been able to improve my\nown business and life, and, as a by-product, viewers from all over the globe have\nbene\u0000ted from this wisdom.\nTo help you understand how the most successful entrepreneurs and\nstrategists think and operate, I’m going to share their stories. These include\npeople I’ve interviewed, such as Ray Dalio, Billy Beane, Robert Greene, Kobe\nBryant, Patty McCord, and a host of mobsters including Salvatore “Sammy the\nBull” Gravano. The book also includes people I’ve studied and admired from\nafar, such as Steve Jobs, Sheryl Sandberg, and Bill Gates. All of them are\nfascinating, and their stories will help bring my advice to life.\nThe entire purpose of this book is to enable you, regardless of the position\nyou’re currently in, to thrive. By the time you’re \u0000nished reading, you’ll know\nexactly how to make your next \u0000ve moves.\nMy goal is for you to create a series of “Aha!” moments—and to teach your\nbrain to process information and strategize in a new way. Imagine the frustration\nof trying to unlock a safe without the right combination. Then imagine\ndiscovering the combination and opening up a vault of business wisdom. By\nreading this book, you’ll gain the level of con\u0000dence of knowing not only what\nto do but also how to do it. And as a result, you’ll gain the wherewithal to solve\nproblems at all levels while growing your personal brand and business.\n\f\nMOVE 1\nMASTER KNOWING\nYOURSELF"

Far too often, consultants and in\u0000uencers assume that everyone wants the\nsame thing. When I’m speaking to a CEO or a founder, I start by asking\nquestions. Before making any recommendations, I gather as much info as I can\nabout who the person wants to be and what he or she wants out of life.\nI understand that not everyone knows who he or she wants to be. It’s normal\nnot to have all the answers immediately. Remember that this question—and\nevery move in this book—is a process. All the examples I give and stories I tell\nexist for you. They’re meant to get you to re\u0000ect and better understand yourself.\nIf you don’t have a clear answer at this point in time, you’re in the majority. All I\nask is that you keep an open mind and keep reading with the goal, in due time,\nof answering this question.\nThe purpose of this Move is to identify what matters to you the most and\nhelp put a strategy together that \u0000ts your level of commitment and vision. I may\nin\u0000uence you to question certain decisions or ways you’ll go about ful\u0000lling\nyour vision, but it’s up to you to decide to stretch yourself and think bigger.\nWho do you want to be?\nAs you continue to ask yourself this question, your answer will determine\nyour level of urgency.

If you’re looking to disrupt an industry, you’d better be armed with\nthe right story, right team, right data, and right strategies. Really take the time to\nget clear about your story—exactly who you want to be—or you won’t be able\nto soldier on when things get tough. And in business, things always get tough.\nMake Pain Your Fuel\n\f\nI could sit here and tell you about the life that you may live one day. Talking\nabout the cars, the jets, and the celebrities you meet all sounds wonderful, but\n\u0000rst things \u0000rst. You are going to have to endure more anguish than you can\nimagine to get there. Those who can tolerate pain the most—the ones with the\nmost endurance—give themselves the highest chance of winning in business.\nBy the time we’ve been on our own for a few years, many of us have become\ncynical. It’s an ugly thing, but I’ve seen it happen too often. We all have big\ndreams growing up, and we make a lot of plans for ourselves. Then life gets in\nthe way, the plans don’t happen the way we thought they would, and we lose\nfaith in our ability to focus on who we want to be. You may not notice it, but it\nalso hurts your ability to make your next moves.\nWe may even start to think, “Hey, what’s the point in saying I’m going to do\nsomething big if I’m not going to follow through? Better to just aim low and\nplay it safe.”\nThe only thing separating us from greatness is a vision and a plan for\nachieving greatness. When you’re \u0000ghting for a cause, a dream, something\ngreater than yourself, you will \u0000nd the enthusiasm, passion, and joy that make\nlife a great adventure. The key is identifying your cause and knowing who you\nwant to be.\nIn the summer of 1999, I was twenty years old and had left the army. My\nplan: to become the Middle Eastern Arnold Schwarzenegger. That June, I felt\ncertain I would become the next Mr. Olympia, marry a Kennedy, become an\nactor, and eventually govern the state of California.\nAs the \u0000rst step in my plan, I got a job at a local gym, hoping to be noticed as\nsoon as possible. At the time, the biggest \u0000tness chain in the area was Bally Total\nFitness. With the help of my sister, I got an o\u0000er from a Bally in Culver City. It\nhad to have been the smallest and most antiquated Bally location in the state of\nCalifornia.\nDespite the less-than-ideal circumstances, I was promoted and transferred to\nthe largest Bally gym, which happened to be in Hollywood. My plan was\nworking! Because I kept getting better at selling memberships, I was making\n$3,500 a month. Compared to what I had made in the army, it felt like millions."

    "raw_text": "One day, my supervisor, Robby, o\u0000ered me an assistant manager position at\nthe Bally in Chatsworth, thirty miles outside Hollywood. He wanted me to turn\nthe club around; it had been hitting only 40 percent of its monthly goal.\nI didn’t want to go to Chatsworth. I wanted to be a weekend manager in\nHollywood, a position that paid $55,000 a year. Robby promised me that if I\nturned things around in Chatsworth, the job would be mine. The only other\ncontender for it was a longtime employee named Edwin. As long as I\noutperformed him, I could bank on becoming the weekend manager in\nHollywood.\nFast-forward ninety days. We were able to turn things around at the\nChatsworth club, taking it from 40 percent of the monthly revenue goal to 115\npercent. I was near the top of the leaderboard companywide, well ahead of\nEdwin. When I got a call from Robby to meet, I assumed that corporate must be\npleased. My plans were coming together. I was going to meet the \u0000tness legend\nJoe Weider, be spotted by a major Hollywood agent, get my acting career o\u0000 the\nground, and meet a Kennedy. I can vividly remember the anticipation I felt that\nafternoon before my meeting with Robby.\nThe moment I walked into Robby’s o\u0000ce, I knew something was o\u0000. This\nwasn’t the same guy who had promised me the position if I outperformed\nEdwin.\nThat’s just paranoia, I reassured myself. Give him the bene\u0000t of the doubt\nand hear what he has to say.\n“Patrick, I’m so proud of the performance you and your team put up the last\nninety days,” Robby said. “I want you to stay there for another six months and\ntake the Chatsworth club to the next level.”\n“What do you mean?” I asked. “I made it very clear that I wanted the\nweekend manager position in Hollywood.” That position, he said, had already\nbeen \u0000lled.\nAt that point, my blood was boiling. I couldn’t believe a grown man could\nlook me in the eye after going back on his word. I had been so focused on\nbeating the goal that I hadn’t put any thought into what I would do if it didn’t\nwork out.\n\f\nWho’d gotten the position? You guessed it: Edwin. Why? Edwin had been\nwith Bally for six years; I’d been there for only nine months. Never mind my\naccomplishments, kicking Edwin’s tail on the national leaderboard. Never mind\nthat, according to objective data, I had earned it.\nIn fairness to Robby, he wasn’t being unethical. Because he had to follow\nmarching orders from corporate, he was being political. In many ways it was a\nblessing to learn at a young age that corporations have agendas and that\nadvancement is rarely based on merit alone. Robby could tell I was furious, and\nhe asked me to step outside to cool o\u0000. I walked to the parking lot and tried to\nthink. I imagined how these events were going to dictate the rest of my life. I\nplayed the movie in my mind, and I just couldn’t accept how it would end if I\naccepted Robby’s decision. I didn’t realize it then, but I was already processing\nmy next moves. The only challenge was that I was reacting to someone else’s\nmove rather than executing my own. I walked back into his o\u0000ce and asked him\nif the decision was \u0000nal. He said it was.\nAt that point, I looked him in the eye and told him I quit. Initially, he\nthought I was kidding, but I was con\u0000dent about my decision. What’s the point\nof working somewhere that doesn’t give you a clear direction on what you need\nto do to advance in the company? Why put myself through the misery? It was at\nthat moment I realized I could not live another day with my destiny in someone\nelse’s control.\nI wasn’t thinking like a winner at that point in my career. Given my inability\nto think more than one or two moves ahead, I was still an amateur. As a result, I\nwas petri\u0000ed. Driving home, I felt as though I’d made the worst decision of my\nlife. My coworkers started calling me to ask what the hell I’d been thinking. My\nfamily couldn’t believe it, either.\nBy the time I got into bed that night, most of the emotion had worn o\u0000, and\nI was left wondering what I was going to do next. Later in my career, I learned\nhow to process while in the heat of the moment. Thankfully, that night I was\nable to calm down just enough to think about my next moves. When I think\nback on it now, I realize that it was a de\u0000ning moment in my life.\nI had to look inward and get clear about who I wanted to be—and where I\nwanted to go. The list I made looked something like this:"

    "raw_text": "1. I want to make the name Bet-David mean something, so much so that my parents will be proud\nof the decision they made to leave Iran.\n2. I want to work with people who keep their commitments—especially leaders with whom I\nwork and who impact my career path.\n3. I want a clear formula for how to get to the top based purely on my results. I can’t stand\nsurprises or the moving of goalposts.\n4. I want to build a team that has bought into the same vision I have to see how far we can go\ncollectively. This includes running mates whom I can trust 100 percent.\n5. I want to make enough money that I’m no longer controlled by other people’s politics and\nagendas.\n6. I want to get my hands on every single strategy book out there to see the game from a broader\npoint of view so I can learn how to minimize corporate bullying.\nOnce I was clear about who I wanted to be, I could see my next moves. The\n\u0000rst step was \u0000nding a sales job with merit-based pay and clear expectations.\nTwenty years later, I can tell you that clarity comes from making decisions that\nare aligned with your core beliefs and values.\nUse Your Haters and Doubters to Drive You\nI shared that story about being denied the promotion because I want you to tap\ninto your own pain. It’s those moments of feeling powerless, angry, or sad that\nclue you in to your deepest drive. Don’t underestimate the power of shame to\nmotivate you. When Elon Musk left South Africa for Canada at age seventeen,\nhis father had nothing but disdain for his eldest son. In Neil Strauss’s November\n2017 Rolling Stone pro\u0000le, he quoted Musk’s description of his dad’s send-o\u0000:\n“He said rather contentiously that I’d be back in three months, that I’m never\ngoing to make it, that I’m never going to make anything of myself. He called me\nan idiot all the time. That’s the tip of the iceberg, by the way.”\nBarbara Corcoran, the real estate mogul whom you may have seen on Shark\nTank, was one of ten children growing up in a blue-collar New Jersey town. In\n1973, she was twenty-three and working as a waitress in a diner. While there, she\nmet a man who lent her a thousand dollars to start a real estate company. They\nfell in love and were set to live happily ever after. Had the script played out, my\nguess is that Corcoran would have built a decent real estate business. But in\n\f\n1978, the man dumped her and married Corcoran’s assistant. To rub salt into\nthe wound, he said to her, “You’ll never succeed without me.”\nIn a November 2016 interview with Inc. magazine, Corcoran said that she\nhad turned fury into her best friend. “The minute a man talked down to me, I\nwas my best self,” she said. “I was going to get from that person what I wanted,\ncome hell or high water…. He was not going to dismiss me. I would not tolerate\nit. I would say quietly to myself, ‘F@#& you.’ ”\nThat type of rejection, that type of shame, can be one hell of a motivator. I\nwant you to think back to the teachers, coaches, bosses, parents, or relatives who\nhave put you down over the years. This doesn’t mean you have to carry their\nnegativity around with you. Instead, you can use it as rocket fuel. Corcoran\nchanneled her rejection into resolve. As a result, she built the most successful\nresidential real estate \u0000rm in New York and sold it for $66 million. Then she\nwrote a best-selling book and became a TV star on Shark Tank.\nAs an investor in entrepreneurs, Corcoran actually looks for people who are\nfueled by pain. She sees growing up poor as an asset. She said, “A bad childhood?\nYes! I love it like an insurance policy. An abusive father? Fabulous! Never had a\nfather? Better! My most successful entrepreneurs didn’t all have miserable\nchildhoods, but somebody said they couldn’t, and they are still pissed.”\nI’m not making light of your pain. Believe me, I experienced enough shame as\na child to last a lifetime. It hurt then, and it still hurts now. Put-downs, insults,\nand abuse can be either your excuse or your fuel. And it’s damn powerful fuel.\nMichal Jordan’s late father said, “If you want to get the best out of Michael\nJordan, you tell him he can’t do something.” Five years after he retired from the\nNBA, when Jordan gave his Hall of Fame induction speech, guess what he\ntalked about most? All of his haters and doubters. He still hadn’t gotten over\nthose who had put him down. Leroy Smith Jr. was the guy who had taken his\nroster spot when Jordan had gotten cut from the high school team. To show you\njust how much Jordan used pain as fuel, he went so far as to invite Leroy to the\nceremony. Jordan said, “When he made the team and I didn’t, I wanted to prove\nnot just to Leroy Smith, not just to myself, but to the coach that picked Leroy\nover me, I wanted to make sure you understood: you made a mistake, dude.”\n\f\nMusk, Corcoran, and Jordan all used pain as fuel. You can do the same.\nThink back to your toughest moments when you declared, “Never again!”\nRecalling those experiences will be your fuel.\nI still feel as though I have enough haters in my life to \u0000ll Madison Square\nGarden. When I was twenty-six, I was invited to my alma mater, Glendale High\nSchool, to give a speech. I ran into a guidance counselor, Dotty, who asked,\n“Why are you here, Patrick? To see the motivational speaker?” She went on to\ntell me that she had always felt sorry for my parents. Here I was, twenty-six years\nold, being invited back to my high school to tell my success story, and Dotty was\nshowering me with pity, reminding me that a decade earlier, she had felt sorry for\nmy parents because I had been such a lost kid with no motivation or direction.\nDotty ended up escorting me to the auditorium, where six hundred students\nwere waiting to hear from the motivational speaker, when suddenly the vice\nprincipal got up and started to introduce me as the speaker. The look on her face\nwas priceless.\nI didn’t say a word back to Dotty. Instead, I just \u0000led her away as another\nhater who keeps popping up in my life. And those people keep driving me. As a\nmatter of fact, I have a list of statements that people have made to me over the\nyears. Most people read positive a\u0000rmations to produce con\u0000dence in\nthemselves, but I have a completely di\u0000erent set of “a\u0000rmations” by people who\ndoubted me or tried to put me down. Reading and rereading the list creates a\nlevel of \u0000re inside me that all the money in the world can’t match.\nMaybe the most important hater in my life was a stranger. When I was\ntwenty-three, my dad had his thirteenth heart attack. I rushed to Los Angeles\nCounty Medical Center, a public hospital. The people there were treating him\nlike dirt. I completely lost it—lashing out, throwing things. “You don’t mess\nwith my dad! You crossed the line!” I was so out of control that security had to\nescort me out of the hospital. During my tantrum, a guy said to me, “Hey, listen.\nIf you had money, you could get better insurance and get better doctors to take\n\f\ncare of your dad. But you didn’t pay for this. Taxpayers are paying for this. This\nis called public health insurance.”\nAfter they threw me out of the hospital, I sat in my Ford Focus, and the tears\npoured out of me. The anger was replaced by shame. The guy was right. My dad\nwas getting lousy care because I didn’t have the money to provide him with\nbetter care. And I didn’t have the money because I spent more time in\nnightclubs than I did in front of customers. I was at a low point in my life. The\nwoman whom I’d thought I was going to marry had just dumped me. I had\n$49,000 in credit card debt. For thirty minutes, I cried like a baby.\nAfter all that crying, all the self-pity and shame, I \u0000nally got it. That night,\nthe old Patrick died.\nEverything about me changed. I used that pain to remember every slight I\nhad heard in my life: “1.8 GPA. Loser. Hanging out with gangsters. Poor Patrick,\nhe’s got no shot. Divorced parents. Mom’s on welfare. Had to join the army\nbecause he had no other choice. Never going to be anybody.”\nI swore that my dad would never again work at the ninety-nine-cent store on\nthe corner of Eucalyptus and Manchester in Inglewood, where he was regularly\nheld up at gunpoint. He was never going to get lousy health care for the rest of\nhis life. Neither he nor I was ever going to feel ashamed again.\nI said to myself, “Bet-David. The world’s going to know this last name. I\nknow the pain we went through. I know the challenges we went through as a\nfamily when we came to America from Iran. I remember how embarrassed Mom\nwould get from speaking broken English. I remember the look on Dad’s face at\nfamily gatherings when he was looked down upon by people. Before long, you’re\ngoing to be so proud of your last name. You’re going to be so proud you came to\nAmerica. You’re going to be so proud of the sacri\u0000ces you made.”\nA funny thing happened the next day. No one recognized me. I got the best\ncompliments of all time: “Pat, you’ve changed. We don’t even recognize you. We\nmiss the old Pat. We want him back.” Back then, I was famous for going to all\nthe nightclubs in LA from Thursday night to Sunday night. I used to go to\nVegas twenty-six times a year. I told all my friends to stop inviting me. They\ndidn’t listen. They \u0000gured it was only a matter of time before their old buddy\nwas leading the charge to the clubs again.\n\f\nLittle did they know that they would never get back the old hard-partying,\nundisciplined Pat. I had shifted 180 degrees. It was game over. From that day\nforward, no one, including me, ever saw the old Pat again. I used all those haters\nas fuel, and it’s provided me with a steady \u0000ow of energy ever since, a reserve that\nI can call upon at any moment.\nI want you to channel all your fury and pain into fuel. This is your show. If\nyou change yourself and focus on who you want to be, nothing can stop you.\nI’m getting worked up remembering these stories. They don’t hurt like they\nonce did, but at the drop of a hat, I can go back to any of the scenes to produce\nthe same fuel. Something tells me there will be many new ones to add to the list.\nAnd although the pain never vanishes, I now view all those haters and doubters\nas gift givers. Ultimately, they led me to a point of clarity about exactly who I\nwant to be. They led me to say “never again” and to create a list of my\nnonnegotiables (things you are not willing to compromise no matter the\ncircumstances). I encourage you to try to do the same.\nIn doing so, don’t compromise your quirks or other things that may seem\nweird to others—these idiosyncrasies are important because of what you have\nexperienced and the way you are wired. You really need to get clear about what\nyou can sacri\u0000ce and what you absolutely will not sacri\u0000ce. It will lead you to\ncreate your own list of nonnegotiables.\nDiscover What Role Suits You Best\nAll the discovery questions I’m asking are to lead you to \u0000nd out which path\nsuits you best. The key is to \u0000nd the best position that highlights your talents.\nFounder? CEO? Chief strategy o\u0000cer? Sales leader? Number two? Business\ndeveloper? Intrapreneur? The list goes on. We’re living in an era in which\nentrepreneurs get the headlines, but that life may not be for you. That doesn’t\nmean there won’t be a place for you to build wealth and \u0000nd ful\u0000llment.\nThe only way to choose is by \u0000rst understanding: Who do you want to be?\n\f\nBeing an entrepreneur is high risk and high return, both personally and\n\u0000nancially. Most people only pay attention to the \u0000nal product of a successful\nentrepreneur. People don’t see what he or she has overcome—all the struggles,\nthe betrayals, the empty bank accounts. Being home at six o’clock to have dinner\nwith your family is not always going to happen when you are an entrepreneur.\nDepending on the size of your vision, maybe you can pull it o\u0000 most nights. But\nif you’re going to be a disruptor and build a multinational conglomerate, you’re\ngoing to have to make a lot of sacri\u0000ces. This is all a part of owning your next\nmoves and having others, including your family, buy into them.\nThe busier you are, the more organized you’ll need to be. There’s this notion\nthat you can’t win at the highest level and also have a great family life. It won’t be\neasy, but you can \u0000nd a way to make it work if it matters to you. It’s a choice\nonly you can make. For me, being an example to my kids of \u0000ghting to ful\u0000ll my\nvision is more important than being home for dinner every night. My family\nunderstands this because we’ve planned for it. Plus, having more money gives\nyou more choices. You may have to work on holidays. Having resources provides\nyou with the \u0000exibility to take your family with you and turn a work trip into a\nfamily vacation. As with everything, there are risks and rewards, costs and\npayo\u0000s. The route you choose will depend on your answer to the question: Who\ndo you want to be?\n\f\nEmbody Who You Want to Be by Living Your\nFuture Truth\nHow many times have you heard a person say, “When I make it, I’ll…” Or “Once\nI’m successful, I’ll…” You hear people say things such as “When I make my \u0000rst\nmillion…” or “Once we move into our own building…”\nI understand the chicken-and-egg conundrum. You can’t build a world-class\nheadquarters or license the slickest software until you have cash \u0000ow. What you\ncan do—regardless of your income—is position yourself in the best way possible\nby making the right moves.\nA phrase I use all the time is future truth. It means to live in the\npresent as if your future truth has already become a reality.\nI’m inspired by this quote from IBM founder Thomas J. Watson:\nIBM is what it is today for three special reasons. The \u0000rst reason is that, at the very beginning, I had\na very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was \u0000nally done. You might say I\nhad a model in my mind of what it would look like when the dream—my vision—was in place.\nThe second reason was that once I had that picture, I then asked myself how a company that\nlooked like that would have to act. I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was\n\u0000nally done.\nThe third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would\nlook when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that,\nunless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there.\nIn other words, I realized that for IBM to become a great company it would have to act like a\ngreat company long before it ever became one.\nDid you get that last sentence? You must act like a great company (or a great\nentrepreneur/intrapreneur) long before you ever become one. Are you\nfollowing? Let me explain.\nA visionary is somebody who is not living in the here and now. He or she has\nalready seen at least \u0000ve moves ahead and is living in that reality. Explaining your\nfuture truth to others, however, may come across as unrealistic, boastful, or even\ndelusional. Not long after we started our company in 2009, I gave a speech at the\nJW Marriott in Palm Desert, California, to a group of four hundred people. I\nsaid, “One day, the best comedians, athletes, thinkers, and US presidents will\nattend and speak at our convention.” Nine years later, Kevin Hart performed at\n\f\nour annual convention. Before our agency turned ten, I interviewed former\npresident George W. Bush and the late Kobe Bryant in front of our entire\ncompany.\nPeople want to follow someone who is driven by his or her future truth. It’s\nthe reason we’re enamored with visionaries. As long as the person speaking has\n100 percent conviction, he or she will get others \u0000red up.\nThe best leaders have the ability not only to believe in future truths but also\nto inspire others to believe and execute their vision. On May 25, 1961, President\nJohn F. Kennedy delivered a Special Message on Urgent National Needs to a\njoint session of Congress. JFK’s goal was clear: “before this decade is out…\nlanding a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” With \u0000ve\nmonths to spare, that future truth became reality when, on July 20, 1969, Neil\nArmstrong became the \u0000rst person to walk on the Moon.\nDo you know who you want to be? Do you have a clear vision of what that\nlooks like? At this very moment, is the way you are acting consistent with your\nfuture truth?\nUse Your Heroes and Visuals to Remind\nYourself Who You Want to Be\nTo take things to the next level and set the bar even higher, aspire to be heroic.\nThink about your heroes, and ask yourself how they would act in such\nsituations. It’s no coincidence that there is an entire cottage industry of books\nasking “What would [name] do?”\nYou want to be wealthy? There’s a book titled What Would the Rockefellers\nDo? How the Wealthy Get and Stay That Way, and How You Can Too. Want to\nbe more like the founders of America? Reference the book What Would the\nFounders Do? Our Questions, Their Answers.\nAsking what someone else would do forces you to take a time-out and\nconsider your next sequence of moves. The second thing it does is challenge you\nto embrace greatness. I believe so strongly in challenging myself to reach another\nlevel that I hired an artist to create a unique visual for my o\u0000ce.\n\f\nIt’s an unusual painting with an unusual name: Dead Mentors. It stops\npeople in their tracks as soon as they see it. In the painting, I’m surrounded by a\nnumber of people who could never have been in the same room together.\nWhenever I’m in my o\u0000ce, I turn to them constantly for counsel. They are\npeople with whom I like to process issues on all levels: economics, competition,\nstrategy, politics, and my personal life. Seeing these ten luminaries together is a\nconstant reminder to me to embody ten heroic traits.\nFrom left to right: Albert Einstein, John F. Kennedy, bust of Marcus Aurelius, Abraham Lincoln, Tupac\nShakur, Patrick Bet-David (the student trying to soak up wisdom), Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Ayrton Senna,\nMilton Friedman, Martin Luther King, Jr., bust of Aristotle.\nI chose individuals who di\u0000ered in their philosophies yet were in the same\n\u0000eld.\nJohn F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. One was a Democrat, while\nthe other was a Republican. Both were great presidents, yet each took a di\u0000erent\napproach to getting things done. Both were eventually assassinated, for di\u0000erent\nreasons (which I won’t go into now).\nAlbert Einstein and Milton Friedman both had a way of viewing the\nworld through the eyes of a mathematician, but they disagreed on the economy\nand taxes.\nTupac Shakur and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., both wanted similar\noutcomes but took di\u0000erent approaches. They were also both killed for having\nstrong views.\n\f\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran from 1941 to 1979, changed\nhis country’s direction until his inability to handle too much power led to the\nfall of an empire. He’s a reminder to never get so con\u0000dent as to underestimate\nan opponent such as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolt that\nexiled him.\nAyrton Senna, the greatest Formula One driver in history, tested his limits\nto take his craft to the very edge of perfection. He reminds me to push\nboundaries and hone my power of concentration (I named my daughter Senna).\nMarcus Aurelius was a leader who never put himself above the people. He\ndidn’t let power get to his head. A practitioner of stoicism, he reminds me to\nstay both centered and humble.\nAristotle was the voice of reason in Alexander the Great’s ear when he was\non his way to becoming king. The ability of the Greek philosopher to think and\nreason reminds me of the importance of slowing down and taking the time to\nprocess issues.\nIn the back, I am whispering something in Tupac’s ear while listening to the\ndiscussion being led by Abraham Lincoln.\nOn the far right, there’s an empty seat for someone, who one day may be\nrevealed.\nTogether, the people in this painting have become a personal assembly of\nmentors whom I turn to daily. Who do you have in your mentoring vault,\nwhether dead or alive, that o\u0000ers perspective and counsel?\nCreating a visual of your heroes will challenge you to live up to the ideals of\nthose you seek to emulate.\nEvery time I walk into my o\u0000ce, this painting moves me. I’ve continued to up\nthe ante. I also have a custom bookshelf that’s \u0000fteen feet long and spells out\nREAD. All the images in my o\u0000ce push me to think and make clearer decisions. I\noften plot my next \u0000ve moves in this room because it’s \u0000lled with a spirit that\nmakes me think big.\n\f\nMy o\u0000ce is bizarre, and it was expensive to create. The key is to start\nsomewhere. I started o\u0000 with pictures from magazines that I taped to my\nbathroom mirror and now have my entire o\u0000ce as a reminder of what inspires\nme. I challenge you to \u0000nd a way to create a visual that reminds you to be heroic.\nStart with something small. You don’t need to hire an artist; Photoshop will do.\nIf you’re a visionary, blow up a picture of Walt Disney or Steve Jobs and put\nit in a prominent place. Have a little fun with it. If looking at Walt Disney\ndoesn’t inspire you, keep a picture of Mickey Mouse or a stu\u0000ed Mickey in your\no\u0000ce.\nIf you’re building an e-commerce company, ask, “What would Je\u0000 Bezos\ndo?”\nIf you’re running an investment \u0000rm, ask, “What would Warren Bu\u0000ett do?”\nIf you’re running a media company, ask, “What would Oprah Winfrey do?”\nOur heroes inspire us. That’s why it’s so powerful to surround yourself with\nthem. The more we see them and the more we see them looking at us, the greater\nour chances of acting heroically.\nWho do you want to be?\nThat’s the question we started with, and it’s the one we’ll end with. The only\nway to answer it is by becoming clear about the life you want to live. In doing so,\nyou will immediately embody that person and act as if you are already there.\nIt’s a lifelong practice. I hope the tools in this chapter will lead to some\nbreakthroughs and get you onto the path to knowing who you truly want to be.\n\f\n2\nStudy the Most Important Product:\nYou\nBecome who you are by learning who you are.\n—Pindar, ancient Greek poet\nIt’s only in the movies that someone gets hit by a lightning bolt of inspiration\nand suddenly knows exactly what to do with his or her life. The reality is that\nknowing who you want to be is a process that requires eﬀort.\nLet’s look at what some of the great philosophers have said about knowing\nourselves.\nThe most di\u0000cult thing in life is to know yourself.\n—Thales of Miletus\nThere are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.\n—Benjamin Franklin\nAnd you? When will you begin that long journey into yourself?\n—Rumi\nThales, Franklin, and Rumi are warning us that this process is hard. For me,\nmaking three hundred cold calls a day wasn’t hard. Working eighteen-hour days,\nsix days a week was something I could handle. Knowing myself, on the other\nhand, was the toughest thing I had to do. I did it because I knew there was a\npayo\u0000. Three sages explained why better than I can.\n\f\nKnowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.\n—Aristotle\nWhen I discover who I am, I’ll be free.\n—Ralph Ellison\nAt the center of your being, you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you\nwant.\n—Lao Tzu\nWe read books about studying other people. We focus on how to read,\npersuade, and in\u0000uence them. That’s certainly valuable. But imagine if you were\nto spend as much time studying something more important. Studying others\ngives us knowledge, but studying yourself ultimately leads to an incredible\namount of freedom. Studying yourself helps you reach self-acceptance, which\nliberates you from self-judgment. Instead of beating yourself up all the time, you\nlearn to accept yourself and—as I did—realize that what you thought were\nshortcomings can actually be assets. I’m going to continue to remind you that\nthe most important person to study is the only person you’re going to have to\nlive with for the rest of your life: you.\nAlign Your Career with Your True Self\nMy friend Shawn had more than a dozen jobs before he turned thirty.\nEventually, he worked for me as an insurance agent. It shouldn’t have surprised\nme when he called one day to say he didn’t want to sell insurance anymore. I met\nwith him and asked what was going on. I listened for a while; then I said, “Let\nme be very honest with you, but it’s going to sting. Are you okay with that?”\nHe paused for a moment, but eventually he said yes.\n“Every single job you ever quit, it was your boss’s fault. I can name all the\nbosses you’ve bad-mouthed over the years. It’s always someone else’s fault, but\nyou know whose fault it never is? Yours. Why do you think this is?”\nIt took a little bit of nudging, and to Shawn’s credit, he started taking\nresponsibility. He understood that the only way to make our conversation\nproductive was to look inward rather than point \u0000ngers outward.\n\f\nWe started processing. He began digging beneath his surface anger, talking\nabout a guy he had hired who had now surpassed his own income. He admitted\nto feeling upset and even humiliated that someone he had hired was now doing\nbetter than he was. We boiled his feelings down to a combination of bitterness\nand envy.\nI suggested that he and that guy might have di\u0000erent dreams; that perhaps\nthat young star wanted to make millions of dollars and he didn’t. I said, “Put\neverything aside for a moment and let me ask you a question: What type of life\ndo you want?”\nShawn was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was taking the question\nseriously. Finally he said, “Pat, if I made $150,000 a year, I would live a very good\nlife. I want to coach Little League. I want to be there for all my kids’ big\nmoments. And to be honest, I want to be able to sleep in some days. Maybe I\nneed to be honest that I’m not all that driven.”\nShawn’s candid self-re\u0000ection gave him direction. He started to see that he\ndidn’t have to compare himself with colleagues or friends. He didn’t have to try\nto be the richest person in his o\u0000ce. Once he realized what would make him\ntruly happy and satis\u0000ed—a $150,000 yearly income and plenty of family and\nleisure time—everything started to fall into place.\nAs we talked about it, he asked, “But isn’t this thinking too small?”\n“To someone else, maybe it is,” I said. “But are you comfortable knowing that\nyou may never \u0000nd out your true potential in business but can still make a\ncomfortable living and be a phenomenal dad?”\nShawn became quiet again, and I gave him time to re\u0000ect. He started to see\nthat this discussion wasn’t about other people; it was strictly about him. He\nneeded to be honest about who he was and what he wanted out of life. Maybe as\na way to distract himself from how uncomfortable this type of re\u0000ection can be,\nhe asked me what I wanted.\n“This has nothing to do with me or anyone else,” I said. “When you’ve\ndecided what your best life looks like and execute that vision, you won’t be\nenvious.”\n“I hear you, Pat,” he said. “But I’m still curious about what you want.”\n\f\n“I want to take over the freakin’ world, but that’s me, not you. You can’t try\nto be me, and I can’t try to be you. That’s the worst thing you can do.”\nShawn nodded, relieved. He had a goal, the right goal. He could create a long-\nterm strategy around it, not just a quick \u0000x (i.e., quitting a job). Together we had\nprocessed the issue, and after doing so, he was able to make a choice that was\nideal for him.\nThe key for Shawn was to stop comparing himself to others. Being home for\ndinner every night was important to him. And for the life he wanted, he could\ncoast his way to making $150,000 a year and devote his heart and soul to his kids.\nWhy try to act like Je\u0000 Bezos or Richard Branson when you are wired di\u0000erently\nand have di\u0000erent goals?\nStudying the most important product requires you to dig deep. Shawn, like\nmany people, had been operating on false assumptions about what motivated\nhim. He hadn’t reached down far enough or been honest enough with himself.\nWhen he did, suddenly his world made sense and he understood the choices he\nhad to make to be ful\u0000lled. Keep in mind that there still may come a day when\nhe will wake up wanting to give more in order to experience more. As we’re\nabout to discuss, your goals will evolve over time. If Shawn notices envy creeping\nin, it will be a powerful indicator that he should reexamine his goals.\nIn his insightful book Principles: Life and Work, Ray Dalio said, “I learned that\nif you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but\nnot everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in\norder to pursue even better ones.”\nWhen you’re honest about who you are, you learn to stop wanting\neverything.\nEnvy is an indicator that alerts you if you’re being honest with yourself. If\nyou can look at someone who has things you don’t and say, “You know what. I\nreally don’t want that,” you know you’re in a good place. If you say you don’t\nwant something but don’t mean it, envy will eat away at you. What it’s telling\nyou is that you really do want it but are afraid to work for it.\n\f\nWhat will give you peace of mind is being honest enough to know who you\nare and do what it takes to live the life you want. You’ll know you are living the\nbest version of yourself when your reaction to the success of others, including\nthose who have things you don’t have, is feeling happy for them. Again, if you\nfeel envy, it’s an indicator that either you’re lying to yourself about what you\nwant or you lack the discipline to accomplish it.\nI’ve met many unful\u0000lled, unhappy people. The most dangerous unhappy\npeople I’ve met are those who are both extremely ambitious and extremely lazy.\nWhat this combination produces is envy, which is a deadly sin that will make\nyour life a living hell. These are people who think big and want to do something\nbig, but they’re not willing to put in the work to earn it. They’ll cheat. They’ll\nthrow you under the bus. They’re constantly looking for shortcuts. And if\nsomeone else has what they want, it eats away at their very soul.\nIf someone is winning at a higher level than you are, either lower your\nexpectations to match your work ethic or increase your work ethic to exceed\nyour expectations. If you do neither, you’ll be miserable.\nWhat it all boils down to is that alignment is the key to ful\u0000llment. Keep\nthese things in mind:\nYour vision must align with who you want to be.\nYour choices must align with your vision.\nYour e\u0000ort must align with the size of your vision.\nYour behavior must align with your values and principles.\nInquiry Leads to Acceptance, Which Leads to\nPower\nThere’s only one person you have to spend every second of your life with. Not\nyour parents. Not your spouse. Not your kids. Not your best friend. You. The\nmoment you understand who you will have to spend the rest of your life with\nand learn to accept it, you’ll eliminate self-judgment, which will empower you to\nmake more bold moves. It will minimize overthinking and increase execution.\nWhen I read Power vs. Force by David R. Hawkins, I was fascinated by his\nexplanation of the di\u0000erent levels of consciousness. Before reading that book, I\n\f\nwould have thought that courage would be at the top of the pyramid. Only after\ndoing all of my internal work did it make sense that, as you can see in the chart\non the next page, acceptance is even higher than courage.\nI understand why you may be afraid of self-inquiry. It can hurt to come out\nof hiding and shine a light on your \u0000aws. All of the hours of introspection I’ve\ndone have revealed a lot about myself: some things that were good, some things\nthat were bad, and some things that were terrible. Because I did the hard work of\nexamining myself, I started to accept myself. I also learned that it was okay to be\nvulnerable and to share who I was. In doing so, my friend Byron Udell, who\nruns a good-sized company out of Chicago, recommended the book The\nHypomanic Edge: The Link Between (a Little) Craziness and (a Lot of) Success in\nAmerica by John D. Gartner. That book helped me see that I wasn’t alone in my\n(hypo)mania. I accepted my madness and started using it as an advantage instead\nof as a crutch. It also made me realize that I was wired to do big things and my\npersonality would be an asset in building a company. Eventually, I learned to\nstart accepting myself, \u0000aws and all.\nFour Areas That Drive You\nWhen I was selling gym memberships at Bally Total Fitness, I worked with a guy\nnamed Stuart. Like me, Stuart left to sell insurance. Around the same time, we\nboth started our own insurance agencies. We were having lunch one day,\n\f\ndiscussing our goals, and Stuart said, “Our vision is to be one of the largest\ninsurance agencies in the entire state of California. If I work hard for a few years,\nthe money will be rolling in and I’ll be on easy street.”\nI said to Stuart, “We’re going to have half a million licensed agents. We’ll be\nthe biggest agency in America.” He looked at me as if I were delusional. I looked\nat him in confusion, wondering how anyone could think so small when the\nmarket potential was so big. I was chasing history books; he was chasing a\nsimpler life.\nStuart is driven by the idea of having \u0000nancial freedom. He makes half a\nmillion dollars a year and barely has to work. He knew what drove him, and he\ngot it. He probably looks at my life and feels as though he dodged a bullet. Why\nwould he possibly put up with all the stress and endure the hundred-hour\nworkweeks and constant pressure when he is driven by \u0000nancial freedom?\nAre you seeing where I’m going with this? You have to know what drives you.\nIt’s going to be di\u0000erent for everybody. Once I realized what drove me, I didn’t\nneed an alarm clock. It’s the reason that even though I now have \u0000nancial\nsecurity, I’m more motivated than ever.\nIt’s why I’ve endured those hundred-hour workweeks. It’s why the minute I\nfeel the smallest amount of self-pity creep in, I stop and remind myself: this is\nwhat you signed up for, Patrick. I start to sound like that old Toyota\ncommercial: you asked for it, you got it. The interesting thing is that had I stayed\nat my former position, I could have coasted my way to a $5-million-a-year\nincome. And even when it looked as though I might go bankrupt and insane (at\nthe same time, no less), I never once regretted my decision.\nWhy? Because I had taken the time to learn what drives me.\nNow it’s your turn. You can start by breaking down drive into four\ncategories: advancement, madness, individuality, and purpose.\n\f\nIt’s normal to have more than one motivation. It’s also normal for your\npriorities to shift. Take a careful look at the list above, and think long and hard\nabout what drives you. Most of the time, it requires some catalyst to examine\nwhat motivates you. There are four reasons that may trigger you to reassess what\ndrives you:\nBoredom\nDeclining results\nA plateau or stagnancy\nA feeling that your talent is declining\nIf you’re feeling any of those, now is the perfect time to dig deeper and\ndetermine what you really want.\nGraduate to Your Next Why\nAnother way of thinking about drive is by asking, “What’s my why?” When\nsomeone asks you this, you may say, “I don’t really know my why” or “I think\nI’m doing this for my family” or “I want to be \u0000nancially free.” Everybody has a\nwhy. The challenge is that the majority of people never graduate from their\ninitial why.\nYou may be familiar with the psychologist Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of\nNeeds. In the 1943 paper “A Theory of Human Motivation” in Psychological\n\f\nReview, Maslow described how your needs evolve. If you’re facing death, you’re\nnot going to be thinking about your purpose. If you’re struggling to feed your\nfamily, you won’t have any bandwidth to think about your legacy. It makes\nsense. It also makes sense that once you meet your core needs, you naturally\nmove up the pyramid and covet things such as belonging, esteem, and growth.\nI view the desire for growth as “graduating to your next why” and see it as\nbeing on four levels.\nFour Levels of Why\nLEVEL 1: SURVIVAL\nEveryone who has a job to make money is focused on paying his or her bills.\nSome people stop here.\nLEVEL 2: STATUS\nYou’ll hear people say things such as “You know, I want to make seven \u0000gures.”\nWhy? Status. They may want to have a nice car or house or send their kids to a\nprestigious school. They want to be able to talk about having this or that. This is\nall about keeping up with the Joneses. Status is still lightweight, but it’s higher\nthan survival. When most people reach this level, they slow down and settle.\nLEVEL 3: FREEDOM\n\f\nSome people may say, “You know what? I’m so sick and tired of six \u0000gures. I\nwant to be free. I want to make the kind of money that gives me breathing room,\nwhere I don’t have to be in the o\u0000ce every day.” They may want to live in a\ncommunity where their kids can play outside without their having to worry\nabout them. Or they may want to be a digital nomad so they can surf in the\nsummer and ski in the winter.\nFreedom as a why is somewhat sel\u0000sh. There’s nothing wrong with wanting\nfreedom, but it may feel empty once you’ve attained it. If that’s the case for you\nand your feeling of contentment turns to frustration, you now have the luxury\nof going deeper and focusing on aspects of life that will provide you with a true\nsense of ful\u0000llment.\nLEVEL 4: PURPOSE\nDe\u0000ning your purpose is asking the questions: How do I want to be\nremembered? How do I want to make an impact on other people’s lives? It’s\nabout realizing why you were put on this earth and pushing the limits of the\ngreatest version of yourself. Operating at the highest level of the pyramid is\ndriven by:\nHistory\nHelping others\nChange\nImpact\nEnlightenment/self-actualization\nVery few people reach the purpose level. Why? Some of it is fear. Some of it is\nspending their entire lives stuck in survival mode without any time to think.\nSome of it is being caught up in too many distractions, whether they are social\nmedia, sports, or entertainment. In truth, nobody really gets caught up in these\ndistractions. They choose them to escape reality and avoid the di\u0000cult work of\nself-inquiry. What it comes down to is not spending enough time asking the\nright questions.\nIf you want to make a big impact, it will happen only if you’re willing to sit\ndown and ask yourself some important questions about life. Unfortunately, so\n\f\nmany times people are just going, going, going, and they die never having asked\nthemselves the questions that matter most.\nMy challenge to you is: no matter what level you’re at now, get clear on your\npurpose.\nPersonal Identity Audit\nOf all the tools I o\u0000er you in this book, the Personal Identity Audit may be the\nmost important. We tend to overuse the expression “This will change your life.”\nIn this case, I’m speaking from experience when I say that conducting a Personal\nIdentity Audit (a series of questions that lead to self-discovery) changed my life\nradically and exponentially.\nAll the disruptors, founders, leaders, and athletes you admire didn’t get there\nby luck. There was a moment (or many moments) when they were brutally\nhonest with themselves. It’s a private time when they face their vices, their fears,\nand their limiting beliefs that have been stored in their hearts and minds and\nhave been holding them back. This usually happens after adversity strikes.\nThe reality is that very few people are willing to take a time-out in life to\nexperience a breakthrough. Life is going faster today than ever before. Think\nabout how many di\u0000erent apps we have to check on our smartphones that we\ndidn’t worry about ten years ago. How often do we check Instagram, Facebook,\nTwitter, YouTube, email, LinkedIn, and news apps? The list of all the things we\ncheck outside our own selves goes on and on.\nIn August 2003, a wise friend of mine could sense that I was struggling. At\nage twenty-four, I had begun to show signs of talent and perseverance. I could\nsell, and I was hungry for knowledge. I was also angry and confused. Rather than\nlecturing me or sending me to a shrink, that wise friend gave me a list of eighty-\nthree questions. His only instructions were, “Go somewhere quiet, keep asking\nquestions, and don’t leave until you \u0000nd some answers.”\nI did exactly as he said. I would sit alone on a beach for seven or eight hours\nand answer these questions. I was so emotional. It was intense. I had moments of\nfrustration and disappointment. I kept asking myself, “Why are so many people\nexperiencing success and not me?” By being alone, I could actually see what was\n\f\ngoing on and start to notice trends and patterns. Ultimately, I felt a sense of relief\nbecause I realized that all the problems and the answers resided within me. With\nthat knowledge, I knew I was in control of \u0000xing it.\nThat exercise was so valuable that I’ve condensed the most important\nquestions to create what I call the Personal Identity Audit.\nWhen you study the most important person (you), you will begin to learn\nhow to conquer the most important person who is holding you back (you).\nThese questions—along with the re\u0000ection that resulted—completely\nchanged my life. They took me from being an average person to realizing my\npotential in life. I came out feeling free. I came out accepting my limitations and\nchallenges. Now when I advise entrepreneurs, I ask them to conduct a Personal\nIdentity Audit.\nThe key with this exercise is to treat it with the utmost respect. You don’t\nneed to \u0000nish fast or aim for a perfect score; the only right answer is the honest\nanswer. The idea is to have a breakthrough. The more emotional it is for you, the\nmore the likelihood of it creating a breakthrough. Once you go through the\naudit, encourage others to take it as well. There’s nothing like having a\nbreakthrough in life and inviting others to do the same.\nThe Personal Identity Audit can be found in the appendix on page 282.\nSince I posted the Personal Identity Audit on my website, more than 200,000\npeople from 130 countries have taken it. The results have been transformational.\nPlease take your time with it. I hope the experience is as profound for you as it\nhas been for countless others.\nThe Beneﬁts of Self-Discovery and Conductinga Personal Audit\n1. Awareness shows you that you are at the center of all your problems (and solutions).\n2. You realize that your problems can be \u0000xed.\n3. You crack your limiting beliefs.\n4. By spotting patterns, you can end detrimental habits.\n5. Your anger at others dies out once you see that no one but you controls your fate.\n\f\nStudy Your Blind Spots by Actively Looking\nfor Them\nNo matter how much you study yourself, you can’t help having blind spots. The\n\u0000rst step in recognizing them is wanting to recognize them. That desire will grow\nout of understanding that discovering your blind spots ultimately makes you\nbetter. That’s your why for seeing your blind spots.\nI wasn’t born with self-awareness. In fact, early in my career, I had hardly any.\nWhen I \u0000rst started my insurance company, I came across as arrogant in\nmeetings. I’d meet with major insurance carriers and start o\u0000 by telling them\n“We’re going to have half a million licensed insurance agents. We’re going to\nwrite more insurance than anyone in history.”\nIn their 1994 book Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,\nJim Collins and Jerry I. Porras coined the term “Big Hairy Audacious Goal\n(BHAG).” They de\u0000ne it as “an audacious 10-to-30-year goal to progress\ntowards an envisioned future.”\nAfter I declared my BHAG to people at those big insurance carriers, they\nwould invariably respond by asking me, “How long have you been in business?”\n“Two weeks,” I would say.\nMy blind spot wasn’t having a BHAG. My blind spot was failing to\nunderstand my audience. The \u0000nancial markets crashed at the end of 2008. The\ndamage was so bad that AIG, the industry behemoth, nearly went out of\nbusiness. The entire industry had no choice but to play defense. Here I was in\n2009, this thirty-year-old Middle Eastern guy, proclaiming that he was going to\nhave half a million agents. The last thing other insurance companies wanted to\nbet on was a risky start-up when their focus was on survival, compliance, and\nrisk management.\nCathy Larson was an executive with Allianz, a $400 billion company. When I\ngave her my bold pitch, she said, “You’re full of it. You know how many people\nsay this kind of stu\u0000? You better have more of a track record before you start\nmaking these outlandish proclamations.”\nHer advice hit home. Even though I was certain about my future truth—in\nmy mind, I had already seen it happen—I needed to adapt my approach to meet\n\f\nthe needs of my audience. My vision didn’t change, but my approach needed\nserious work.\nI began thinking about how I could adjust my pitch. I thought deeply about\nwho I was. With more self-awareness, I came up with a plan that re\u0000ected what I\nwanted to achieve. I learned to translate my BHAG into my next moves and,\nmore important, to understand the sequence of those moves against the\nbackdrop of a new awareness about the audience.\nKnowing Yourself Is an Eﬀortful Process and\nRarely an Epiphany\nYou need to understand who you are, what makes you tick, how much risk you\ncan handle, and what type of family you want to create. The key element behind\nall the stories and exercises in this Move is honesty. Looking in the mirror can be\npainful at times. I shared with you how much I cried when I took the Personal\nIdentity Audit. The pain was worth it.\nOnce you become clear about the most important product (you), your\ndecisions will \u0000ow naturally and lead you to accomplish your goals."

It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as\nthe driver.\n—Ayn Rand\nEric Drache was one of the most talented poker players in the world. Over a\nspan of thirty-six years, from 1973 to 2009, he \u0000nished second in World Series of\nPoker stud events three times. Many regarded Drache as the seventh best poker\nplayer in the world. The running joke was that he only played against the best\nsix! Despite his talent, he was often broke. Let him be your example of how not\nto choose a business.\nYou want to choose a path that puts the odds of winning in your favor; in\npoker, it’s called game selection. What determines if you win in any game (or\nbusiness) isn’t how good you are; it’s how good you are relative to your\ncompetition. That’s why it’s so important to know your own strengths and\nweaknesses and \u0000nd a market in which you have an inherent advantage.\nThe \u0000rst two chapters of this book were about self-awareness. Now that\nyou’ve de\u0000ned who you want to be and studied the most important product\n(you), it’s time to get more speci\u0000c about selecting a career that aligns with your\nvision.\nI don’t think everyone wants to build the next Apple.

    "raw_text": "working eighty to a hundred hours a week for twenty-plus years to build a\nmassive empire. Some people simply want to build a small business that will give\nthem control without having to deal with the day-to-day politics of working for\na Fortune 500 company. Others want to build an online business that they can\nrun while traveling the world.\nSelf-awareness is critical to forging your path. When you are honest with\nyourself, you may realize that being an entrepreneur isn’t the right path for you.\nIf that’s the case, as you’ll see in this chapter, there are still many options to\nliving a ful\u0000lling and lucrative life.\nTake Control by Climbing Your Own Ladder\nWhenever I give a talk, I ask everyone in the room: Who is the richest person you\nknow?\nMost people can answer this question in a heartbeat. We’re all aware of that\none uncle or cousin or family friend, the one who hosts the extended family for\nThanksgiving in his big house, the one who is always posting pictures from\nexotic locales.\nQuestion two for the audience: Did that person accumulate all that wealth as\nan employee or as an owner?\nWhen I ask that second question, the room lights up with understanding. I\ncan see it in their faces. “Holy cow!”\nYet, from the time we learn to talk, we are trained to believe in climbing other\npeople’s ladders. First you climb the school ladder: get good grades, get into a\ngood college, and then try to get into an even better law, business, or medical\nschool. If you excel on the school ladder, you get to start climbing the corporate\nladder: work for a comfortable salary, do work with no personal meaning so you\ncan climb your way up to middle management. Then you’ve reached “security.”\nThat’s a lie, as those who have climbed the ladder can attest. Robert\nKiyosaki’s book Rich Dad, Poor Dad debunked the myth that education is the\npath to riches. Wealth and success are not waiting for most of us at the top of\nanyone else’s ladder. A richer life—\u0000nancially, emotionally, intellectually—is\npossible only when you take responsibility for your own success.\n\f\nThere is more than one way to take responsibility for your own success: you\ncan work on commission for a company; or, as you’ll see in a moment, you can\ncarve out a role as an intrapreneur within a big company.\nOne thing I can tell you with certainty is that becoming an entrepreneur\ncannot be about the money. I know that sounds odd to say when you’re focused\non becoming a millionaire or billionaire. If your motivation is only money,\nyou’ll stop at some point. You’ll become lazy or complacent. If you want to be\nan entrepreneur, your reason has to go beyond wealth.\nThe pain of owning a business is too great to tolerate just for money. By no\nmeans am I saying that vanity isn’t an important motivator for many people.\nRecognition, power, fame, prestige, and respect (proving your haters wrong)\noften play a big role in choosing this path. But the ones who keep \u0000ghting are\ndriven by something much bigger than just money.\nAs we just discussed, there are many ways to accumulate wealth and live a\nful\u0000lling life. Entrepreneurship may have the biggest \u0000nancial upside, but it also\nhas the most casualties. I’m showing you di\u0000erent viewpoints and highlighting\ndi\u0000erent people’s paths in order to provide more insight into you.\n59.1 Billion Reasons to Be an Intrapreneur\nI received a message on LinkedIn from an IBM executive who wrote, “Pat, I’ve\nbeen at IBM for a while and I have been following your content for a few years. I\nmake good money, but I really want to be an entrepreneur. However, I have a\nwife and three kids and I’m kind of worried about them. What should I do?”\nWe emailed back and forth for a while, and I asked him questions about who\nhe wanted to be. He began to see that intrapreneurship looked like the ideal\nchoice for him. This is when you’re part of a company and create a new business\nunit, lead a new initiative, or work out incentives that reward you for driving\ngrowth and innovation. In some cases, it might just mean being so indispensable\nthat a company has to pay you equity to retain you.\nThe average term of both a CFO and CTO is less than three years. They\ntypically stick around long enough to vest their equity. However, some do end\nup sticking around longer with the company due to new opportunities. Not\n\f\nonly do they earn a solid salary, but they have a major upside. You could say it’s\nhaving your cake and eating it, too.\nAs of March 2020, $59.1 billion was the net worth of the richest intrapreneur\nin the world, Steve Ballmer. In 1980, Ballmer dropped out of an MBA program\nat Stanford to become employee number thirty at Microsoft. After twenty years\nof thinking and acting like an intrapreneur, he became CEO in 2000 and\nremained so until 2013. Through stock and bonuses, he amassed a fortune.\nWhen the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers came up for sale in 2014, he easily outbid\nthe other suitors. His success as an intrapreneur made the $2 billion price tag\nseem minuscule.\nWe all remember that Steve Jobs founded Apple in 1976, but some people\nforget that he was ousted in 1985. It was only after founding NeXT and Pixar\nAnimation Studios that he returned to Apple in 1997 as CEO. He negotiated a\ndeal for the company to give him 5.5 million shares, which, of course, were\neventually worth billions of dollars. What’s the moral of the story? That even\nJobs became an intrapreneur.\nWhat are the qualities of intrapreneurs? And how can you identify a\ncompany that attracts and breeds them? Let’s start by answering the \u0000rst\nquestion.\nFive Qualities of a Successful Intrapreneur\n1. An intrapreneur thinks like an entrepreneur.\n2. An intrapreneur works like an entrepreneur.\n3. An intrapreneur possesses the urgency of an entrepreneur.\n4. An intrapreneur innovates like an entrepreneur.\n5. An intrapreneur protects the brand (and the money) like an entrepreneur.\nThis list highlights the fact that intrapreneurs don’t act or think like regular\nemployees; they act and think like owners. They’re not working for a paycheck;\nthey’re working to build something that gives them pride and ful\u0000llment. In\ndoing so, they want recognition, autonomy, resources, and ownership.\nOne way intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs di\u0000er is that the former is typically\ndeferential to authority while the latter is de\u0000ant. Intrapreneurs have the respect\nto say, “Look, I think like you, I work like you, I’m the same as you, but you put\n\f\nup the money. You ignited the vision, and you took all the risk.” Intrapreneurs\nwork within the system but \u0000nd ways to improve themselves while also\nimproving the company. If you don’t have that degree of respect for the founder\nor the current CEO, you are not in the right place to build a business within a\nbusiness.\nHow Companies Breed Intrapreneurs\nGoogle hires creative people, and to leverage their skills, it created a policy to\nfoster intrapreneurship. In their IPO letter, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey\nBrin, described their “20 percent” idea:\nWe encourage our employees, in addition to their regular projects, to spend 20% of their time\nworking on what they think will most bene\u0000t Google. This empowers them to be more creative\nand innovative. Many of our signi\u0000cant advances have happened in this manner.\nProducts created during this 20 percent time include Google News, Gmail,\nand AdSense.\nCompanies that attract and breed intrapreneurs do so by communicating in a\nway that appeals to innovators and stars who might be more comfortable\nworking in a “corporate” environment. These companies put forth a vision that\nany employee can come up through the ranks—without putting up their\nsavings, without having to risk their sanity and sleepless nights—and still have\nthe freedom to innovate, execute, and cash in on their ideas.\nWhen I was in my twenties, I was a big earner for an insurance company. My\nidea was to grow my wealth by becoming the CEO. I didn’t think that I had to\nquit to make a big impact and the fortune that goes with it. One day I pulled a\nmove straight out of the \u0000lm Jerry Maguire and sent a sixteen-page letter to the\nhigher-ups explaining my vision. Nobody responded. Then I sent it to the\nparent company. Within thirty minutes a man named Jack responded and set up\na meeting. I told several of the executives my ideas and they tried to implement\nsome of them, but a woman named Katie shut down the entire thing.\nIt was the opposite culture to Google’s. The company made it clear that it\ndidn’t want me to innovate. Just as the journalist Laura Ingraham told LeBron\n\f\nJames to “shut up and dribble,” that company basically told me to “shut up and\nsell.”\nKatie was a perfect example of an aristocrat and a bureaucrat. In the book\nBarbarians to Bureaucrats: Corporate Life Cycle Strategies, Lawrence M. Miller\ndescribed how companies go through multiple states—prophet, barbarian,\nbuilder, explorer, administrator, bureaucrat, and aristocrat—and once in a while\na synergist shows up to save the company from going out of business. At the\ntime, there were many lawsuits against that insurance company, not to mention a\nreputation for unethical practices that damaged its brand.\nBecause Katie was stubborn and unwilling to change, she ended up costing\nthe company a few hundred million dollars. That’s not a small number. She was\narrogant. She was pompous. She reminded me of Cersei Lannister in Game of\nThrones, the villain who thinks she’s above everyone. What may have been worse\nis that the company tolerated Katie’s behavior. This is very common when the\noriginal prophet leaves and the existing builders and explorers give way too much\npower to someone who doesn’t deserve it.\nKatie forced my hand. She cornered me. At the time, I didn’t see my next\nmove as investing all my savings to become an entrepreneur. Before making a\ndecision, I scheduled a meeting with Katie, the executive team, and their\nattorneys. There were several people in that room whom I respected\ntremendously. I went there to share my next \u0000ve moves and see what they had to\nsay.\nThey didn’t say much at the time. It was only later that word got back to me\nthat they’d thought it was all a ploy. They had assumed I was threatening to leave\nso they would give me cash to stick around. The president of the company at the\ntime was a man I really respected. He said to me, “Patrick, this is very common\nin this industry. A major player like you comes and makes demands to get money\nor else he leaves. The company isn’t buying your blu\u0000.”\nI can tell you that no one at that table has a chance in hell of winning the\nWorld Series of Poker. They read the situation completely wrong. I was being\n100 percent sincere. Rather than viewing my suggestions as an opportunity for\ngrowth, they went on the defensive and tried to justify the status quo by\nclaiming that my intention was to shake them down."

The company’s culture—starting with the guy at the\ntop, who was risk averse—forced them to stay in their lane and keep the status\nquo.

Losing time on the\nclock will come back to haunt you, whether you’re playing chess or the game of\nbusiness.\nCompanies must build their compensation structure to reward ideas and\ninnovation. Intrapreneurs want to see that if they work, act, and innovate, their\ncompany will reward them like entrepreneurs with bonuses, stock options, or\nwhatever else they have in place to do so. If you’re a rising star in an organization\nand see a path to riches within the organization, you’ll likely stay. If not, it will\nlose you. That’s exactly what happened to me.\nLike the IBM executive who reached out to me for advice, you may be\nambitious and talented and still have sound reasons not to start your own\nbusiness. Working with (not for) a company that fosters intrapreneurs is a great\nalternative.\nDon’t Judge an Entrepreneur by the Final\nProduct\nIt doesn’t matter how perfect a person’s life looks. At some point in his or her\ncareer, he or she has struggled.\nThis tweet is a perfect example of the gap between how entrepreneurs are\nperceived and their actual reality.\n\f\nToo many people judge entrepreneurs by who they are now instead of who\nthey were before. They also fail to see (or don’t want to see) the pressure that\ncomes with success. That misconception is a blind spot that may fool you into\nmaking the wrong move.\nWhen I meet successful entrepreneurs, I want to know about the period\nwhen it felt like they were in hell. I ask questions such as: What did your\nschedule look like when you weren’t sure if you could pay the mortgage? Did\nyou cry yourself to sleep or stay up all night paralyzed with fear? Tell me about\nthe toughest things you had to overcome. Tell me what terri\u0000ed you. Tell me\nwhat helped you get past all your fears and insecurities.\nIt’s the same when I interview personalities and celebrities on Valuetainment.\nI don’t ask the clichéd questions that everyone else does or glorify notoriety, and\nI especially don’t want to highlight the glamorous side of being a CEO. I want to\ntake the conversation deeper because that’s where the real value of someone’s\nstory lies.\nI took a number of my colleagues with me on a trip to Dubai in 2015, including\nSheena and Matt Sapaula, a recently married couple.

I said,\n“These two are such a power couple. They are going to be killing it.”\nImmediately, Sheena and Matt turned red in the face and a few other people\nsmiled and laughed, \u0000nding something amusing. I had no idea what was going\non.\nAfter dinner, we were on a yacht; everyone had had a few drinks, and Matt\nsaid, “Pat, they [meaning the colleagues with whom we ate dinner] saw Sheena\nand me get into a terrible \u0000ght in the elevator.”\nThey both felt awkward, but as we talked, the conversation turned to\nmarriage and they started asking me about mine.\n“Let me tell you something,” I said. “My wife and I have awful \u0000ghts. We had\none last week. If you were to eavesdrop, you would think we were ten seconds\naway from \u0000ling for divorce.

Ask any couple who has been married for twenty\nor thirty years if there was ever a moment when they considered calling it quits.\nI’d bet the vast majority will say yes.\nWhat’s interesting about this story is that Sheena and Matt had just joined\nthe company in 2015. Four years later, together they were earning more than\n$1.5 million a year. Everyone sees their success. Few witnessed what they had to\nendure to get there.\nRather than judging an entrepreneur by the \u0000nal product, look at the\nproduct in development. Accept the reality of all the adversity involved, and be\nhonest with yourself about how hard it’s going to be. If this sounds frightening,\n\f\nmission accomplished! I’m here to tell it like it is. And once again, you may\nrealize that entrepreneurship may not be for you, just as others are feeling more\nstrongly than ever that it’s the path they must take.\nFind Your “Blue Ocean”\nI’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of starting any speci\u0000c kind of\nbusiness. There are many books and online resources that will tell you how to\nopen a franchise restaurant or develop an app. Instead, I want you to think more\nbroadly about \u0000nding a game you can beat.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the\nCompetition Irrelevant by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, professors at\nINSEAD in Fontainebleau, France, was published in 2004. This book was the\nkey resource that led me to \u0000nd a game in which I could win. The premise of the\nbook is that rather than competing in games where you’re an underdog, \u0000nd\nunexplored new markets in which you can win—and ultimately make the\ncompetition irrelevant.\nIn the late 1950s, when the Haloid Company saw that it couldn’t compete\nwith bigger competitors, it changed its focus to an area where they saw a blue\nocean: photocopy machines. It even changed its name to Haloid Xerox in 1958.\nOn September 16, 1959, the Xerox 914 was advertised on TV. The product\nbecame so successful that the company changed its name again in 1961 to Xerox\nCorporation.\nBusinesses need a unique selling proposition. Part of \u0000nding a market in\nwhich you can win is knowing who you are. Process the competitive landscape:\nIs this a place where you believe you can do well, given who your competition is?\nDo you possess the necessary resources to compete? Do you need to acquire\nspeci\u0000c resources before you can compete?\nIn the past, I competed against government-backed companies, and I was\nalways at a disadvantage. To win at that game, you need to be a government\ninsider. And as I learned the hard way, if you’re not on the inside, you’re on the\noutside. Because those companies possessed clout and other resources that I\nlacked, I could work hard and still lose."

    "raw_text": "Have you educated yourself about the competition? Is there some additional\nbene\u0000t your competitor has that you can’t beat, no matter what you do? If so,\nyou’re in the wrong niche. Don’t complain that the game is rigged. Instead, \u0000nd\na game in which you have a di\u0000erential advantage.\nIn Blue Ocean Strategy, the authors warned against trying to beat competitors\nat their strengths. They insist that it’s a losing position and o\u0000er a ton of\nevidence to support their claim. They believe instead in focusing on blue-ocean\nmarketing, going into areas that are relatively fresh and open to superior growth.\nLet’s go back to the year 2007. Barack Obama, a newly elected senator, was\nusing social media to build his platform and become the hot presidential\ncandidate. Meanwhile, on December 17, 2007, Ron Paul, at age seventy-two,\nraised $6.2 million (55,000 donations, more than 24,000 new donors) online in\none day. The old establishment brushed it o\u0000. How could they make sense of it\nwhen they didn’t use social media?\nI was twenty-nine years old, and I didn’t have an Ivy League Rolodex, much\nless a college degree. I was an immigrant from Iran, an outsider in an industry in\nwhich the average insurance agent was a \u0000fty-seven-year-old white male.\nIf your \u0000rst instinct is to think that I was at a disadvantage, you may be more\nprone to see threats than opportunities. Perhaps you are using your lack of\neducation as an excuse for not forging ahead. What I want you to see is how\nexamining both your unique skill set and the competitive landscape will lead you\nto blue oceans.\nThink about what a \u0000fty-seven-year-old white male often lacks. For starters,\nvery few speak Spanish. Second, most aren’t comfortable enough with social\nmedia to use it as a marketing tool. And last but not least, baby boomers often\nstruggle to understand how millennials view the world today, which makes it\ntough for them to relate.\nIn 2007, the typical insurance agent was, in fact, an aging white male. But in\n2007, the United States no longer looked like Little House on the Prairie. The\nUnited States was Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York. It was diverse. I\nsaw that as an opportunity. The baby boomers were no longer the biggest\ngeneration of all time. They had been replaced by millennials, who were carrying\na computer (aka smartphone) that went everywhere with them.\n\f\nThe \u0000nancial industry’s marketing approach—like that of the old-guard\npoliticians—was outdated. The industry had yet to embrace social media. At the\nsame time, it had changed its policies. Baby boomers had people cold-call them\nto sell them \u0000nancial services. In 2003, legislation creating the National Do Not\nCall Registry made cold calling a crime. As a result, the old guard had no way to\nreach new customers.\nAt the same time, there were techies who believed that life insurance could be\nsold online. Again, it seemed as though I was at a disadvantage. I could barely\npronounce “algorithm,” much less build a platform to sell insurance over the\ninternet. And again, I saw an advantage. I knew that, unlike car insurance,\npeople don’t buy life insurance. It must be sold, and it must be sold face-to-face.\nTo turn things in our favor even more, Google \u0000gured out how valuable\ninsurance referrals were, so it made “insurance” the most expensive keyword to\nbuy ($54.91)—far more expensive than the next three: mortgage ($47.12),\nattorney ($47.07), and loan ($44.28).\nThe workforce had shifted. Women were now often the ones making\n\u0000nancial decisions for their families. In 2007, the Latino population eclipsed 45\nmillion and was projected to grow to more than 70 million by 2025. Meanwhile,\nthe competition was not looking to hire women or Latinos.\nAnother trend was that \u0000nancial services \u0000rms were trying to be all things to\nall people. There was a movement to create a one-stop shop to sell everything\nfrom life insurance to mutual funds to loans, and the list goes on. As a result,\nworkers had to pass more tests and be trained much longer before they could\nmake money. My reaction to this was to \u0000nd the blue ocean. Rather than go\nbroad, I went narrow. I made it so that new agents, instead of having to get four\nor \u0000ve di\u0000erent investment licenses, had to get only one. In doing so, I\nstreamlined the training process and eliminated unnecessary scrutiny by the SEC\nand other regulators.\nIn 2008, Barack Obama, an African American man, using social media as a\nkey component of his campaign strategy, was elected president. He beat the\nestablishment candidates Hillary Clinton (in the primary) and John McCain (in\nthe general election). Meanwhile, it was business as usual for the old-guard\ninsurance industry. As a result, I found my blue ocean. This gave me con\u0000dence\n\f\nthat the strategy of focusing on women and minorities, coupled with a strong\nsocial media presence, could give us an edge.\nFollowing the example I just shared, I want you to focus on using your\nunique talent to \u0000nd your niche in the business you are pursuing.\nWhen you compete against people whose knowledge and skills are inferior to\nyours, you’re likely to win. No business is risk free, but you can decrease the risk\nby choosing a game in which the odds are in your favor. It’s great to have\nbravado and believe you can beat whatever competitors are in your industry, but\nit’s foolish to believe you can win at somebody else’s game."

    "raw_text": "4\nThe Incredible Power of Processing\nIssues\nYou have control over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will \u0000nd\nstrength.\n—Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations\nEvery day, all day long, we are faced with issues. Your best customer threatens to\nwalk away if you don’t lower your price. Your star employee says she’s leaving if\nyou don’t give her equity. A pandemic causes the market to crash 30 percent in a\nsingle month. A bigger competitor is bullying you and trying to put you out of\nbusiness. Your kid gets into a \u0000ght at school. The issues never stop.\nYou constantly hear people talk about the keys to success. It may be the most\ncommon question of amateur podcasters, probably because it’s safe and simple.\nYou’ll hear answers ranging from “marry the right person” to “focus on health,”\n“work hard,” “have faith,” and a host of other things.\nYou’re going to have moments when you feel as though the world is coming\nto an end. An amateur panics, but a grand master doesn’t.\nBefore he does anything, he must \u0000rst “process” what’s happening. He has to\ndo so while staying on an even keel. This is why stoicism is both so important\nand so challenging—and why Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are sages who have\nstood the test of time. Emotion can get the best of all of us and cloud our\njudgment. Sadly, I’ve learned this lesson the hard way too many times. It’s why\nmy answer about the key to success for people at all levels of business is “Know\n\f\nhow to process issues.” Life is always happening; the way you respond is\nbased on how you process issues.\nMost entrepreneurs don’t fail because of a \u0000awed business model or an\ninvestor who backs out. They fail because they refuse to abandon their\npreconceived notions about work and life. They refuse to solve (and learn from)\nany and all kinds of problems as they arise.\nSome people say that common sense can’t be taught. I can tell you that it can\nbe taught, and it can be learned—because once you learn how to become a more\nstrategic thinker, making important decisions is going to seem like second nature\nto you. Not long ago, I was a high-strung CEO with a horrible temper. In 2013,\nI had a panic attack that sent me to the hospital—and recurred every day for\neighteen months. The main cause of the panic attacks was indecision! What kept\nme up at night and made my heart beat faster wasn’t my workload, which I\ncould handle. The problem was that I could never stop thinking about issues. I\nwould replay every decision and every conversation over and over in my mind. It\nwas eating me alive and damaging both my business and personal life.\nI had no peace of mind because I was so worried that I would make a wrong\ndecision.\nI know what it’s like to work eighteen-hour days and still feel as though\nyou’re spinning your wheels. Like most of us, I spent my early career chasing\ncertainty and treating every issue as though it were black or white, as though\nthere were one right solution to every problem—if only I could \u0000gure out what\nthat was. It was as unproductive as it was exhausting.\nIf I could learn how to process issues, you can, too. I’m going to show you\nhow to solve any problem calmly and e\u0000ectively, no matter what the stakes.\nBuilding a business requires you to slay many dragons. Problems are inevitable;\nyou’d better get a grip on solving them. To do so, you must be processing issues\nconstantly.\n1. Processing is the ability to make e\u0000ective decisions based on access to information at hand with\nthe highest odds in your favor.\n2. Processing is about subjecting every di\u0000cult choice, problem, or opportunity you face to a\nrigorous mental analysis.\n3. Processing is playing out strategies, seeing the hidden consequences, and sequencing a series of\nmoves to permanently solve problems.\n\f\nThe Most Important Trait to Process\nEﬀectively: Taking Responsibility\nGreat processors use the word “I” and see their role in whatever problem has\noccurred. They ask questions such as “How did I contribute to this? What did I\ndo to cocreate this situation? How can I improve so I’ll be better equipped to\nhandle something like this in the future?”\nPoor processors play the victim and blame others and external events rather\nthan seeing how they contributed to the problem. You know you’re witnessing a\npoor processor when you don’t hear the word “I.” You’ll hear him or her say\nthings such as “All millennials are lazy. These kids have no work ethic. They are\ncausing my business to su\u0000er.”\nExpert processors replace the word “they” (or “you” or “it”) with the word\n“I.”\nWhen dealing with the same issue, the expert processor will say, “I’m doing a\npoor job managing millennials. I need to see what my blind spots are. I need to\nlearn how to better understand them so I know what motivates them. Or I need\nto hire a di\u0000erent demographic. No matter what, it’s on me to solve this\nproblem.”\nWhat di\u0000erentiates mediocre people from exceptional ones is how deeply\nthey process. Most people are surface-level processors, but the best of the best go\nmuch deeper. Long-term thinking versus short-term thinking is the di\u0000erence\nbetween a grand master and an amateur. Surface-level processors are looking for\na quick \u0000x. They are thinking only one move ahead, and their goal is to make the\nissue disappear for now. Deep-level processors look beneath the surface for\ncauses. They are thinking several moves ahead and planning a sequence of moves\nto make sure the issue doesn’t happen again.\nIt’s important that you see how most people process issues. Blame and escape\nare the most common responses, and they may be your initial reaction, too. I get\nit. We’re all human. Reference this list to see which choice you are making.\nThree Approaches to Dealing with an Issue\n\f\n1. Find someone to blame. It’s much easier to externalize the problem than deal with it. If you\ncan’t identify one person, email all your contacts, telling them to go to hell, followed by a row\nof middle-\u0000nger emojis.\n2. Find a safe space to which to escape. Find a distraction. Check Instagram. Turn on the news,\nESPN, or TMZ. Pretend you can multitask by clearing out your inbox. Better yet, call it a day\nand go home to your warm bed.\n3. Find a way to process by taking responsibility. Take a deep breath and remind yourself\nthat these are the moments that separate winners from losers.\nThe Great Ones Own Their Role\n“My bad.”\nThese are two simple words that all the great ones use constantly. Winners\nalso use phrases such as “This mistake is on me” and “We have no one to blame\nbut ourselves.”\nWhat do victims do? Blame the software. Blame the market. Blame their\nteammates. Blame their customers. Blame their managers. They point the \u0000nger\nat everyone but themselves. As a result, they keep making the same mistakes and\nkeep losing.\nI bet you know some of these people. They’re the ones who tell you that it’s\nalways somebody else’s fault. It’s a constant victim story and a bottomless sea of\ncomplaints. Blaming others distracts them from seeing themselves as the\ncommon factor in all their interactions. The author and relationship coach Mark\nManson said, “I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s\na re\u0000ection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a re\u0000ection of your con\u0000dence\nor lack of con\u0000dence. It’s a re\u0000ection of your neediness.”\nContrast victims to winners. They are easy to spot. They’re the ones who\ntake ownership of issues.\nKids will say, “It broke.” Mature, accountable adults say, “I broke it.”\nJoe Rogan is a perfect example of a leader who holds himself accountable.\nRogan has found success in stand-up comedy, acting, martial arts,\ncommentating on the UFC, and his own podcast. In my view, the key to his\nsuccess is his ability to process issues and accept responsibility. He doesn’t hold\nback his opinions and thoughts. He simply talks through how his mind operates\nand, in doing so, gives us a glimpse into how he processes issues.\n\f\nOn one of his podcasts, he was venting about how a guy he had partnered\nwith to sell co\u0000ee used his platform in a way that didn’t sit right with Rogan.\nYou could hear the frustration in his voice. Rather than blaming the other guy,\nRogan took responsibility. Rather than saying that he had been victimized, he\nowned his role in what had happened. His exact words were “I f—in’ bought it.\nHere we have a problem that we’ve allowed to be created.”\nHe had every right to be angry. Most people would have focused on what the\nother person did. Rather than saying he had been sold (and was therefore a\nvictim who had been taken advantage of), Rogan owned the fact that he had\nbought it (and cocreated the problem by being complicit). When you process\nissues and take responsibility, you stop blaming others. Sure, Rogan started out\nsounding angry, but as he processed the issue, he said, “I feel bad because I like\nthe guy…. I don’t even think it’s intentional.” In other words, it didn’t take him\nlong to realize that the root of his frustration was his own actions.\nA pro who has been processing issues for decades understands that nobody\ndoes anything to him without his allowing it. Rather than becoming bitter,\nachievers use adversity as a lever to get better. In this case, Rogan directed his\nfrustration to avoid making the same mistake again. When most people would\nbe blasting someone else on social media or threatening a lawsuit, Rogan was\neducating himself. He said, “I’ve f—in’ read more about co\u0000ee over the last three\nweeks than I’ve ever wanted to read or thought I would ever have to.”\nProcessing Steps to Take When Someone TicksYou Oﬀ\n1. Take responsibility for your role in what happened.\n2. State speci\u0000cally what you did to create the problem.\n3. Channel your frustration into getting better and preventing future problems.\nThat’s winning processing in action. That’s an e\u0000ective approach by a person\nwho has created a habit of tackling issues and using them for learning and\ngrowth. It’s not innate and not something you learn overnight. However, it can\nde\u0000nitely be learned.\n\f\nIt can also be taught. If you manage people, you need to go beyond\nprocessing issues for yourself. You need to transfer the skill to your managers and\nemployees. The best way is by example. When you become a deep-level\nprocessor, you set the example for how to tackle issues. This is essential to scaling\nyour business.\nI emphasize that processing issues is the most important skill to master\nbecause it’s something you’ll have to do several times a day for the rest of your\nlife. For starters, shifting to someone who takes responsibility rather than\nblaming others will change everything. You will go from being a victim of\ncircumstances to a person who creates his or her own reality.\nHow to Deal with a Crisis\nI feel strongly about taking responsibility and owning your role in what\nhappens. Acting like a victim is the opposite of being a grand master. At the\nsame time, let’s recognize that things do happen outside your control. As we\nlearned from the pandemic that started at the beginning of 2020, you are going\nto deal with external forces that have nothing to do with your choices.\nMany things are not your fault.\nNegative events happen that are beyond your control.\n10 Types of Crises\n1. Health\n2. Technology/Cyber\n3. Organizational\n4. Violence\n5. Revenge from a former employee\n6. Defamation of character\n7. Financial (personal or a market correction)\n8. Black swan\n9. Personal\n10. Natural\nCrises have di\u0000erent lifespans. Some last an hour, and others can last a\nquarter or even a year. Just as the stock market can’t stand uncertainty, neither\n\f\ncan businesses. The unknown is what creates fear. When a crisis does happen,\nthe responsibility of a leader increases tenfold. During heightened uncertainty,\ntoo many leaders make the mistake of going quiet. In the absence of a plan, they\nfeel that saying nothing is better than saying the wrong thing.\nGoing silent during a crisis is an example of making the easy choice instead of\nthe e\u0000ective choice. In fact, the importance of frequent and quality\ncommunication magni\u0000es during a crisis. When everyone is freaking out, it’s\nincumbent upon you, the leader, to be the calm in the storm. Decisiveness,\nresiliency, and calmly processing issues are even more critical at this time.\nThe way you react either shortens or extends the crisis. Let’s put every crisis\non a scale from 1 to 10.\nWhat extends or decreases the lifespan of acrisis:\n1. Your strategies\n2. Your level of poise\n3. Your overexaggeration of a crisis: Turning a 3 into a 9\n4. Your downplaying of a crisis: Turning a 9 into a 3\n5. Your ability to see \u0000ve moves ahead.\nThere’s no reason to blame yourself for an accident or a pandemic. You\ndidn’t create the crisis. It’s your reaction to the crisis that will determine the life\nor death of your business.\nEmbrace Math and Use Investment Time\nReturn (ITR)\nIf you think I’ve gone a bit overboard emphasizing the need to accept\nresponsibility, I plead guilty as charged. So much of processing is about\nperspective. Instead of blaming external events, you have to shift to seeing\nyourself as both the creator and the solver of issues. This is hardly a “soft” skill,\nand it’s one that I can’t emphasize enough. I also can’t emphasize enough that\nexpert processors possess both emotional and analytical tools. Now let’s put\nthose analytical muscles to work."

    "raw_text": "Most issues involve time and money. We make bad decisions when we don’t\nfactor both into our processing. Amateurs react \u0000rst and think second. They\ndecide emotionally and rationalize logically: “Oh, I’m not going to spend any\nmoney on new hires right now, when things are i\u0000y.” Or they may say, “That\nnew software is cool! We’ve got to get that in place tomorrow.”\nWhat you hear in those statements is emotion. A stoic would advise you to\ntake a more measured approach. The software may be cool, but have you\ncalculated how long it will take you to pay back your investment? Have you\ntaken the time to \u0000gure out the true cost of a new hire (salary and bene\u0000ts are\nonly part of the equation) as well as the expected revenue bump that person will\ncreate?\nYou can’t make decisions without analyzing properly and thinking several\nmoves ahead. I’ve probably said “ITR” (Investment Time Return) to my team a\nmillion times. Maybe they’re tired of hearing me saying it, but they know how\nvaluable it is. Here’s the ITR formula:\nBefore making a decision, start out with the “rule of three” by creating three\ndi\u0000erent proposals for dealing with an issue, each with a di\u0000erent price tag.\nWhen people don’t know how I work, they come to me with an idea and say,\n“Here’s how much it’s going to cost.”\nIf they do that, I’ll ask them for two other proposals. Having three di\u0000erent\nproposals/cost estimates helps stretch the dollar. Having three proposals gives\nyou options for maximizing the value of whatever action you take. And don’t\ntell me that we have only one option. If you think that, you’ll in\u0000ate rather than\nstretch your dollars.\n\f\nNext, \u0000gure out your time frame. For instance, if you spend $100,000, you\ncan get something done in six months, but if you spend $200,000, you can \u0000nish\nit in three months. Then you can ask yourself: Is it worth spending twice the\nmoney to get the project done in half the time?\nMaking this determination is a combination of your cash \u0000ow and the\nurgency of the project. If it’s heart-attack urgent, you’d better spend the\nadditional money. Then again, if you have to borrow to \u0000nance the project,\nyou’d better factor the cost of capital into the equation.\nAfter you have calculated the cost and time, \u0000gure out the return. Let’s say a\nproject that costs $200,000 and will take a year to complete will lower your risk\nof losing clients by 8 percent. You are currently writing 30,000 orders a year.\nThirty thousand contracts times 8 percent equals 2,400 contracts. If each\ncontract is worth $200, the total return is $480,000.\nYou don’t have to be a math genius to \u0000gure out that this investment is worth\nit. But you need to dig a little deeper into the numbers. Make a list of the blind\nspots or things that could go wrong with the decision. It’s easy to think about\nwhat could go right, but it’s also important to see the downside.\nTake a page from Dale Carnegie’s book How to Stop Worrying and Start\nLiving and look at the worst-case scenario. In this situation, the worst that can\nhappen is losing $200,000. Can you live with that? Will it put you out of\nbusiness? Your decision should be based on knowing what your all-in risk will be\ninstead of just winging it or looking solely at the positive potential.\nPeople tend to justify their decisions by running best-case numbers. You need\nto be realistic with your assumptions. Even if the investment saved only 4\npercent of the policies (.04 × 30,000 × 200), you’re still looking at a revenue\nbump of $240,000. If you have to borrow at 12 percent to \u0000nance the project\n(increasing your true expense to $224,000), it’s still worth it. In fact, it’s a good\nidea to \u0000gure out the breakeven of any project before committing to it.\n\f\nThere’s no high-level math here. You simply need to think through the\nInvestment Time Return (ITR) formula and make sound projections. It doesn’t\nmean that you need an advanced degree in calculus. It does mean that you can’t\nbe lazy with the numbers and you need to think about several di\u0000erent\noutcomes, which is how you should always think. ITR is a critical skill and one\nthat you’ll use time and time again.\nGreat Processors Rarely Repeat Their\nMistakes\nYears ago, I had a chance to invest in an apparel company. I like fashion, and I\nwas impressed by both the product and personality of the owner, Ray. Plus I\nthought I saw an opportunity when Ray was willing to sell 60 percent of his\ncompany for only a hundred grand.\nMy business was on \u0000re at the time. I was patting myself on the back for\nbeing liquid enough to buy a big equity stake in that business. Why should I\nbother doing research when Ray was such a sincere and talented guy?\nRight after the deal closed, I became a lot more popular. In fact, my phone\ndidn’t stop ringing. As soon as word got out to Ray’s creditors that he had an\ninvestor with deep pockets, they lined up to get their money back. I fought back.\nI got stubborn. I ended up wasting far too many hours—hours that took away\nfrom my actual business—to \u0000ght those people. I blamed the creditors. I blamed\nRay. I blamed everybody not named Patrick. And I kept digging a deeper hole\nfor myself.\nThere’s a wise expression that makes perfect sense: when you’re in a hole,\nstop digging. The problem is that when you’re in that hole, you’re often too\nangry and too emotional to do anything but \u0000ght for your life. Those are the\nmoments when it’s important to have smart people around you who aren’t\nafraid to pull you out of the hole. Thankfully, with nudging from my inner\n\f\ncircle, I \u0000nally relented and threw in the towel on the founder, accepting the loss\nand getting back to work on my primary business.\nI was more upset about my decision-making process than about the money\nitself. I went against my own nonnegotiables—investing in an industry I knew\nnothing about, looking past the personal issues of a charismatic founder, trying\nto generalize instead of specialize—and it ended up costing me. My gut told me\nfrom the beginning that I shouldn’t get involved, but I failed to think more than\none move ahead. I was surface-level processing, and I paid a price for it.\nWhen I \u0000nally took responsibility, I understood my role in the \u0000asco. I\nre\u0000ected on all the mistakes I had made. I had not done proper research or\nperformed due diligence. I had invested in an industry outside my sphere of\ncompetency. I had been both cocky and greedy. I had failed to remember the\nsimple wisdom: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nOnce I owned my mistakes, I was left with a closet full of clothes to remind\nme of a $100,000 mistake, not including all the time I’d wasted. If you’re going\nto lose, don’t lose the lesson. Again, you’re going to use experiences to become\neither bitter or better. To get better, you must re\u0000ect on your mistakes. I was\nreminded of how Magnus Carlsen, after a loss, would analyze every decision he\nhad made to see exactly where and how things had gone wrong. Every master,\nboth in chess and in business, learns more from studying the moves that led to\ndefeat than the ones that led to victory.\nThe Eight Traits of a Great Processor\nThe people I know who are expert processors have very di\u0000erent personalities\nand business strategies, but they share the following eight traits:\n1. They ask lots of questions. Having more data leads to making better assumptions. What caused\nthis? How can we solve it? How can we prevent it from happening again?\n2.  They don’t care about being right or wrong. They’re interested only in the truth. Great\nprocessors want to handle the situation and move on. If someone else has a better idea, great.\nEgo doesn’t become an obstacle to making the right decision.\n3. They don’t make excuses. Wasting time and e\u0000ort on why things went wrong isn’t their style.\n4. They like to be challenged. Their priority is handling a situation quickly and e\u0000ectively, and if\nother people have a solution—even if it di\u0000ers from their own—they want to hear it. They\nrelish people who cause them to consider alternatives or defend their position.\n\f\n5. They’re curious. You can’t solve problems without knowledge. Processors are always learning\nmore about their business and how it works. They love critical details as much as big ideas.\n6. They prevent more problems than they solve. People who are really good at processing issues\nare also really good at spotting yellow \u0000ags before they turn red.\n7. They make great negotiators. Curious problem solvers use logic to \u0000nd a win for all parties\ninvolved.\n8. They’re more interested in permanently solving a problem than putting a Band-Aid on it.\nExpert Processors Look Forward to\nConfronting Issues (They Treat Them Like a\nGame)\nIt’s not a coincidence that great processors who possess these qualities become\nleaders. As they build a track record of processing issues logically and e\u0000ciently\nand meet people’s needs, they earn the trust of everyone who works with them.\nExpert processors don’t fear issues. They welcome them and treat them like a\ngame. If your top sales producer threatens to leave, you start by taking\nresponsibility. This leads you to own the fact that your compensation plan stinks\nand you have no strategy for retention. Plus, your sales training isn’t the best,\nand you need to \u0000nd ways to improve it. Rather than panicking, you embrace\nthe situation. You say to yourself, “Not only do we get to \u0000gure out how to\nretain him, we will also develop a strategy to build the most loyal sales force in\nthe business.” This doesn’t mean that you should linger in your realization of a\nweakness. Instead, it calls for processing it and planning your next moves.\nYour mindset is everything. When you start viewing a crisis as an\nopportunity, you are winning the game.\n\f\nI’ve mentored some great young entrepreneurs during my career, and I’ve had\nthe privilege of watching them become phenomenal at processing issues. I’ve\nseen that skill set elevate them above their peers time and again; it’s why I put\nprocessing at the top of my list for aspiring entrepreneurs, as well as for my own\nkids.\nOnce a month, get together in a room with your leadership team—or simply\na group of three to \u0000ve trusted, open-minded peers—and spend an hour focused\non the next big problem to solve. What I do in these meetings is bring up issues\nand let the team have a collaborative debate on the topic. The stronger the\n\f\ndebate, the closer we get to the best decision. Listen instead of argue. Remain\ncurious.\nThis is the key to entrepreneurial success. Make processing best practices part\nof your company culture, and this ability will seep into the heads of your people,\nwho will get better and better at using it. It will improve the bottom line, sure,\nbut it will also produce better leaders and better human beings. All the world’s\nproblems are issues to be processed, and though you may not be in a position to\nsolve world hunger, you can solve issues in the world in which you live and work.\nMost of us don’t process issues naturally. It’s like marriage. Think about the\ncouples you know who have deeper issues that they’re unwilling to address.\nThey avoid certain subjects—problems with sex, in-laws, religion—until they\nblow up the marriage. Perhaps they manage to stay together for a while, often\ndoing so for the sake of the kids. They’re not happy; they may live together, but\nthey are psychologically apart. And when they get older, they can’t stand it\nanymore and get divorced. They’ve wasted so many years being angry because\nthey never addressed their issues.\nWhen you refuse to process issues, you live a lie and pay the consequences.\nDon’t waste your time, personally or professionally.\nIf you can learn how to face reality and make decisions based on your own\ncompass, you can succeed in business. The hype you read on the internet would\nhave you believe that some are born with the “bug,” a natural appetite for risk\nthat leads directly to success. The truth is a lot more basic. Over a lifetime,\nsuccess in business (whether as an entrepreneur, as an intrapreneur, or in any\ncareer choice) requires a particular mindset, an aggressive and unyielding\napproach to solving problems. The best strategy is to hone your ability to\nprocess issues."

    "raw_text": "5\nHow to Solve for X: A Methodology\nfor E\u0000ective Decision Making\nIn forty hours I shall be in battle, with little information, and on the spur of the\nmoment will have to make the most momentous decisions, but I believe that one’s\nspirit enlarges with responsibility and that, with God’s help, I shall make them and\nmake them right. It seems that my whole life has been pointed to this moment. When\nthis job is done, I presume I will be pointed to the next step in the ladder of destiny. If\nI do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\n—General George S. Patton\nProcessing issues is such an important topic that I want to expand on the last\nchapter—and give you a speci\u0000c methodology for processing and decision\nmaking.\nIn my view, one of the keys to success is having a system. Those who have a\nsystem for making better decisions win. Some decisions are quick, while others\ntake time. You need a speci\u0000c methodology to attack any issue, the same way a\nchess master knows how to play any opening or defend against one once the\nmatch starts.\nI needed to develop a system I could trust to help me sort through exactly\nwhat I needed to \u0000x and to help me see all of my options. I needed to develop an\norganized way of thinking that would enable me to make choices with the\nhighest odds of success, both in the moment and in the long term. The system I\neventually developed didn’t always yield the perfect choice, but because I was\nthorough in how I approached and dissected issues, it left me feeling complete.\n\f\nWhat \u0000nally gave me peace of mind and put an end to the panic attacks was\nhaving a methodology. For the \u0000rst time in my life, I could actually put issues to\nbed and move on without feeling fear and regret \u0000owing through my veins.\nThe ability to solve problems well is the ability to take a complex issue you’re\nfacing and break it down into a step-by-step formula that helps you identify the\nroot of the problem. It’s the same for business as it is for algebra. That’s why\npeople often hear me use the expression “Solve for X.”\nThink about X as the unknown variable. In math, once you \u0000gure out what\nX is, you solve the problem. In business and in life, if you identify X, you also\nsolve the problem.\nThough X is an unknown, it’s not unknowable. Your job is to \u0000gure out\nexactly what you’re solving for.\nLook at life as a big list of mathematical problems to solve. Many of the\ndecisions you make in your life today are based on a list of formulas you have\ngathered in your mind. How to cook spaghetti is a formula. How to get to work\nthe fastest is a formula. How to increase your income is a formula.\nIf you’re not ful\u0000lled and happy with the current results in di\u0000erent areas of\nyour life, it’s most likely due to your needing to make some adjustments in some\nof the formulas you’ve been using for a while. Your way of thinking got you to\nwhere you are today. In order for things to change, your way of thinking needs\nto change. And this may be, by far, the most di\u0000cult thing for you to do. It’s not\neasy to admit that many of the decisions you’ve been making have been based on\na broken formula.\nYou need to be prepared for X—all the unknowns that will emerge during the\ncourse of running a business.\nGet to the Source by Solving for X\nA colleague named Charlie recently said to me, “You know what? I just don’t\nknow if I love this anymore.”\n“What is this?” I asked.\nHe looked confused.\n“You said you don’t know if you love this anymore. What is this?”\n\f\nCharlie said that he was referring to the \u0000nancial services business.\n“Well, that’s not what this is for me, even though we’re in the same \u0000eld.\nThink about it. If you’re in the real estate business, do you love bricks? If you’re\nin pharmaceutical sales, do you love pills? Rede\u0000ne what this means to you. For\nme, it’s the people. I love people, I’m curious about them. Every day at work, I’m\nstudying people, learning their tendencies, and making moves to bring out the\nbest in them.”\n“Oh, I never thought about it like that before.”\nOur conversation motivated him to think di\u0000erently. He processed what this\nwas—the X for which he needed to solve—and tried to get to the root of his\nfrustration.\nSolving for X means isolating your problem. It’s not enough to say that your\nproblem is your boss. You need to drill down to determine if it’s a lack of\nautonomy, merit-based pay, or intellectual challenge. You can’t solve for “your\nboss.” You can solve for a more speci\u0000c, isolated issue.\nCharlie had to become clear about the true source of his dissatisfaction. If he\nwas feeling run-down, maybe what he needed was a break to recharge. In his\ncase, he was feeling run-down because he had put on weight. He realized that he\nneeded to start getting up earlier and get back to his exercise routine. That was\nstep one.\nThen he had to process deeper. His self-esteem was down because he was in a\nsales slump. As a result, each rejection hurt worse. He was in a downward spiral\nwith momentum working against him. Upon more re\u0000ection, he realized that he\ndidn’t hate selling \u0000nancial services. What he hated was feeling exhausted all the\ntime and underperforming at selling \u0000nancial services. He thrived on the\nachievement and sense of accomplishment.\nProcessing deeply means going below the surface. Of course you’re going to\nhave days when your motivation wavers. It’s normal to feel burned out at times.\nIt’s your job to probe deeply and isolate the X that’s causing your pain.\nCharlie decided to take it a step further. He reminded himself why he had\nchosen to become an entrepreneur. He thought about how his former boss had\nmade him feel when he had given a senior position to his underquali\u0000ed son\ninstead of the guy who had busted his tail for him for \u0000ve years. He thought\n\f\nabout how much he had hated that job and visualized all the things that had\ndriven him to sign up for this crazy life.\nBy solving for X, he was able to make decisions about his work that improved\nboth his outlook and his income.\nHow to Solve for X\nWhen we don’t have a methodology, we’re prone to going in circles, paralyzed by\nfear. When we do have one, we have an organized approach for processing issues.\nA methodology will allow you to process any issue in an organized way.\n\f\n\n\f\nProcessing When Your Business Is on the\nLine\nThe most crucial issue I faced appeared just when I thought I had realized my\ndream. I was only thirty, and I had \u0000nally made the leap to starting my own\nagency. Within \u0000ve weeks of my founding the company, Aegon, a $400 billion\nindustry giant, \u0000led a lawsuit against me. It had one simple goal: to put me out\nof business before I even began.\nAegon’s leaders and lawyers didn’t care about how hard I’d worked to save\nthe money to launch my business. They didn’t care that I had just gotten\nmarried. They certainly didn’t care that I had convinced sixty-six loyal agents to\ngive up their careers with established companies to join this crazy dreamer on a\nmission. For Aegon, suing me was just business (and it was also just business\nyears later when the CEO who had sued me ended up joining my advisory\nboard). I didn’t take it personally, even though my entire life savings was on the\nline.\nThat lawsuit was the biggest test I had ever faced. Instead of doing what most\nentrepreneurs do when things go sideways—blame, complain, rage, and spin in\ncircles because of all the doubt—I decided I would no longer wrestle with the\nthings I couldn’t control.\nWhat I needed to do was become clear on what I could and could not\ncontrol. I made two lists, as follows.\nWhat I Can Control\nPlotting my next moves\nMy daily e\u0000ort\nMy choice of attorney and other resources\nKeeping our sales force and our leaders focused on slaying the next dragon\nWhat I Can’t Control\nWhy Aegon chose to sue me\nWhether the lawsuit would put us out of business\n\f\nWhether other insurance carriers would drop our contract\nRather than panicking or overreacting, I crafted a strategy for how to weather\nthe storm and achieve my long-term goals. I chose to settle; I cut a huge check\nand moved on. Even though the expense crippled us, because I had thought\nabout my next \u0000ve moves, we were able to stay in business. The important thing\nwasn’t getting revenge on Aegon or winning a lawsuit; I made a decision that\nfreed us to focus on growing our licensed sales force and maintaining our\nmomentum.\nA funny thing happened after I cut that big check: I was \u0000nally able to sleep\nagain. It’s not often that you gain peace of mind after su\u0000ering such a big loss,\nbut because I had processed the issue thoroughly and thought about my next\nmoves, I was able to put the ordeal behind me, con\u0000dent in the fact that I had\nfully analyzed the situation and come to the right decision.\nIn the past, I might have allowed ego, emotion, and fear to get the best of me\nand fought the lawsuit, even if it meant losing the company and bankrupting my\nfamily. That sure would have felt good—for about three minutes. Instead, I\nprocessed the issue by going step by step through my methodology—as you can\nsee in the chart that follows."

    "raw_text": "Identifying the Real Issue and the Deepest\nWhy\nThe best entrepreneurs look past symptoms and get to the heart of a problem. To\ndo so, let’s hone in on a critical part of this methodology—identifying the real\nissue and the deepest why—so you can get even better at solving for X.\nX isn’t always obvious. In fact, the real issue may be hiding behind a lot of\nemotion and biased opinions. That’s why you’ve got to cut through the clutter in\nyour mind. What’s real and what isn’t? Are you focusing on something because it’s\nsomeone else’s opinion or your own false assumption? Are you blowing up\nsomething beyond what it is because your ego is hurt? Are you separating emotion\nfrom logic?\nOnce you’ve eliminated the “nonissue” issues, focus on causes. You’re looking\nto identify “burning platforms” and “golden gates.”\nBurning platforms: Hot problems that you have to deal with immediately\nGolden gates: Bright opportunities that you need to enter quickly\nOnce you’ve identi\u0000ed the real issues, start asking “Why?” Keep doing so until\nyou reach a point where you can’t ask “Why?” anymore—or when you’re forced to\nrepeat an explanation you’ve already discovered. That is your deepest why and the\nreal cause of your problem. For example:\nWe lost our top customer. Why?\nA competing product costs less. Why?\nBecause it has fewer features. Why?\nBecause most customers don’t need all of the features in our product.\nAha!\nNow you’ve identi\u0000ed one of the main reasons why you didn’t hit your\nnumbers: because your product doesn’t \u0000t your customer’s need. Solving the\nproblem, then, becomes relatively easy: you need to o\u0000er a less expensive version of\nthe product that has fewer features.\nUse this iterative, questioning approach for any issue. Let’s say your top\nsalesperson has left the company. As you ask why, you discover that the salesperson\nleft because your compensation plan had been designed for mediocre salespeople\n\f\ninstead of stars and had been designed that way because your sales director and\nyour CFO hadn’t been communicating properly. The \u0000rst solution is to revisit\nyour compensation plan within the next ten days. The second solution is to have\nthe sales director and the CFO check in with each other quarterly to make sure\nthat each is aware of what the other needs.\nIf your new product’s shipment was delayed, most people are going to be\nlooking for someone to blame. Remember, though, that great processors look for\ncauses—because causes lead to solutions. By asking why, you \u0000nd that the delay\nhappened because your best engineer quit when her manager told her she couldn’t\nwork from home one day a week—for no good reason. The solution: implement a\nmore \u0000exible work arrangement that will lead to improved employee retention.\nFive Questions to Ask to Identify the Real Issue\n1. Do I know what the real issue is, or am I looking at a symptom?\n2. Does the team have the data regarding the real issue?\n3. Is the issue real, or is it an assumption or someone else’s opinion?\n4. Is there a tangible issue, or is it simply a hurt ego?\n5. Am I thinking emotionally or logically?\nGoing Pro at Playing Oﬀense and Defense\nAs an entrepreneur, you feel as though you’re going to have to face a million\ndi\u0000erent types of decisions, right? Actually, only two kinds of events will require\nyou to make decisions:\n1. Oﬀense. The opportunity to make money or advance your business or career. The choices here\noften revolve around growth, expansion, marketing, and sales.\n2. Defense. The opportunity to solve a problem, to stop losing money, or to stop moving\nbackward in some way. The choices here frequently involve legal matters such as compliance and\nprotection against competitors or market corrections.\nOnce the problem or opportunity you’re facing can be categorized as o\u0000ense or\ndefense, it immediately becomes less intimidating. You’ve labeled it, and whether\nit’s o\u0000ense or defense, you’ve dealt with both types of issues in the past. Decision\nmaking then goes from something scary and unfamiliar to something manageable.\n\f\nPlaying o\u0000ense involves looking for opportunities to make money or advance\ngrowth, expansion, marketing, and sales. Playing defense involves solving a\nproblem, preventing the loss of money, or going backward. Issues such as\ncompliance, legal, and \u0000nancial hedging fall into the defense category.\nDoing the Math Is More Art Than Science\nI brought in Alice Terlecky to be our chief operating o\u0000cer. She’d previously been\nwith Paci\u0000c Life, a major insurance company, where she had been very successful.\nAfter she became our COO, I noticed that it was taking an unusually long time to\nprocess policy applications.\nI was frustrated and wanted to know what was going on. I sat down with Alice\nand asked her to walk me through exactly what happens when an application\ncomes in. I asked a lot of questions to help me determine the \u0000ow: what each step\nwas, what actions were involved, and how long each took. It was the same kind of\nanalysis a manufacturing consultant would conduct on an assembly line to\nidentify bottlenecks.\nThen I asked Alice another question: Which of those steps required a hands-on\nmethod, and which could be run automatically by technology that we could buy\nor create?\nWe talked about what functions had to be performed by human beings and\nwhich ones could be handled by computers. We \u0000gured out that if our carriers\ncould handle a certain step via software (only a small number did at that point), it\nwould signi\u0000cantly reduce the application processing time. Alice eventually helped\nme understand why the process had slowed down. She had implemented a new\nsystem to help improve the quality of our insurance policies, which made a world\nof di\u0000erence in our possible liability. As pleased as I was to hear about the quality\nimprovement, I still wanted to speed up the processing time.\nI had Alice set up a call with all the carriers who weren’t using the software and\npitched them on it. Then I brought it up during our next board meeting and asked\nhow much it would cost to cut an additional period of time from our internal\nprocess. We determined that, best-case scenario, we would need to employ four IT\nguys at $150,000 a year for twelve months to be able to do so. When we tacked on\nother expenses, it was easily going to be a million-dollar project.\n\f\nA million dollars is an eye-popping number. It’s also a number that means\nnothing without more analysis. That’s why we took the time to break down the\nnumbers:\nWe could save \u0000ve minutes of processing time per policy.\nFive minutes times 30,000 policies per year is 150,000 minutes (2,500 hours).\n2,500 hours times $20 an hour (our labor cost savings) is $50,000.\nInvestment Time Return (ITR) is a tool that becomes more valuable the more\nyou use it. I’m giving you this scenario so that, once again, you can work your\nanalytical muscles. Every issue you face is going to have its own set of challenges.\nSolving them is not just a matter of “doing the math.” It’s knowing how to think\nthrough an issue so you know which numbers to plug in. ITR is useful only when\nyou make the right assumptions.\nIn this case, we could see that it would take twenty years to get a return on our\ninvestment. If we stopped there (as any amateur thinker would), the math would\ntell us it wasn’t worth it.\nInvestment: $1 million\nTime: 18 months to complete\nReturn: $50,000 per year (based on current sales)\nThat was back in 2017. At that point, I had projected our growth for the next\ndecade.\nBeing a great decision maker is more art than science. Yes, having a\nmethodology helps. You need to be methodical, and you need to understand the\nnumbers. You also have to learn how to analyze the numbers. Solving the question\nof how to process policies faster went beyond determining the labor cost saved. In\nsome cases, doing so might win us business. In others, increasing throughput\nwould improve the satisfaction of both our customers and our agents. But the real\nmissing factor in this analysis was our growth rate.\nWhen I extrapolated our growth rate, the numbers looked like this:\nYear 1: 30,000 policies $50,000 in savingsYear 2: 60,000 policies $100,000 in savingsYear 3: 120,000 policies $200,000 in savingsYear 4: 180,000 policies $300,000 in savingsYear 5: 240,000 policies $400,000 in savings\n\f\nWhen we factored in our growth rate, we could see that instead of taking\ntwenty years to pay back the million-dollar investment, it would take less than \u0000ve\nyears. What had looked like a no-go project quickly became a go project.\nHere’s another thing I learned: IT projects almost always take longer and cost\nmore money than you expect. You need to err on the conservative side when making\nyour time and cost assumptions. As it turned out, the cost of the project more than\ndoubled. The reason, however, was more positive than negative. At each stage of\nthe process, we kept digging to see what other processes we could speed up. With\neach new \u0000nding, the cost of the project increased. The good news was that our\nprocessing speed more than tripled, and the long-term savings far exceeded the \u0000nal\ncost.\nWith the bene\u0000t of hindsight, investing in our process \u0000ow seemed like the\nobvious choice. But go back and think about the potential blind spots. I could\nhave just accepted that Alice, given her extensive experience, was moving the\napplications along as fast as possible. I could have assumed that for her to be\nadequately thorough would take additional time. I could have made the\nassumption that the cost of speeding up the process was not worth the return.\nAre you seeing what it takes to be a great decision maker? It’s both art and\nscience. The methodology gives you structure. ITR gives you a speci\u0000c formula.\nYour projections give you the numbers to plug into the formula. Staying curious\nmeans always looking to improve and tweaking your projections. Your mind gives\nyou the ability to put it all together and make the right decision. It took all of these\nskills, and more, for me to pass my greatest test and survive what could have been a\ncrippling lawsuit.\nThe Latin root of the word “decision” means “to cut o\u0000.” When you make a\ndecision, you are cut o\u0000 from taking some other course of action. Now, that may\nsound limiting, but it’s not; it’s liberating. Plus, the alternative is indecision and\nstagnation.\nIt’s human nature to have blind spots. Laziness, fear, and greed all cause us to\naccept the information we’re given and not dig deeper. As a result, we often miss a\ncritical piece of the puzzle and make bad decisions—or fail to make good ones.\n\f\nUsing this methodology along with ITR takes time, and it also takes practice.\nDon’t expect to become a master processor and be able to solve for X instantly.\nAnd listen: If you always want to be right or always fear that you’re wrong, you’re\ngoing to have trouble processing. Absolute right or wrong act like processing\nroadblocks. It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s the willingness to examine your\nmistakes that will prevent you from making them again.\nBe patient. If you keep working at becoming a better processor, the result will\nbe more than worth it—it will make a huge di\u0000erence in your business and your\nlife.\n\f\nMOVE 2\nMaster the Ability to Reason\nTHE INCREDIBLE POWER OF PROCESSING ISSUES\n1. Moving forward, take 100 percent responsibility for anything that doesn’t work\nout. See your role as the one who created the issue and has the power to solve it.\nApply the Investment Time Return (ITR) formula in order to make better\ndecisions and stretch your resources. Re\u0000ect on any possible mistakes or\nweaknesses, and make your next move(s) accordingly.\nHOW TO SOLVE FOR X: A METHODOLOGY FOREFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING\n2. Share the Solve for X methodology with your leadership team and use it to process\nthree problems you’re currently facing. The Solve for X worksheet can be found\nin Appendix B. Make sure you identify their true causes and the reasons they\nhappened."

Initially, because people are buying you—and you likely\ndon’t have the resources to o\u0000er an extensive 401(k) plan—you’d better be\no\u0000ering an attractive bene\u0000ts program. Later on, you will recruit people to your\nbusiness. Even then, you must keep improving the bene\u0000ts program, or your top\npeople will leave for a company that has a better one.\nAsk yourself this question: If people get closer to you, will they win? Will\nthey do better in life? Do you have a résumé—a list of success stories of people\nwhose lives have been enriched from being around you? In other words, think\nabout what bene\u0000ts program you are o\u0000ering prospective employees. If you’re\ngoing to attract good people, they need to believe you have something to o\u0000er\nthem.\nInstead of being sel\u0000sh and looking to see what I could take from other\npeople, I learned to focus on what I could give them—and I improved my own\nworth in the process. That paradigm shift—that one decision—changed my life\nfor the better. I stopped asking how other people could make my life better, and\ninstead, I asked: How can I make everybody else’s life better just by the bene\u0000ts\nthat I o\u0000er them?\n\f\nYou’ll know you’re succeeding in life when others are winning simply because\nof their association with you. It could be based on the example you set, your\ncontacts, your coaching, your knowledge, or your tough love. Think about these\nthree questions:\n1. What bene\u0000ts are you currently o\u0000ering to others?\n2. In what way do people improve by associating with you?\n3. How many lives have you changed positively in the past year?\nOnce you have a track record of people you have enriched, you can start\nattracting people to your team. Think about who you need to help you, not just\nto do well today but also to achieve your deeper, long-term objectives. Take care\nof them, and they’ll back you up.\nThis advice isn’t just for aspiring CEOs; it’s equally relevant for established\nexecutives.\nSome CEOs make the mistake of thinking that recruiting ends once a person\njoins the company. The reality is that when you recruit top talent, you’ll have to\nconstantly re-recruit that talent.\nIt’s naive to think that your team members aren’t constantly receiving o\u0000ers\nfrom di\u0000erent companies. There’s a reason why there are so many headhunters\nout there. Their job is to recruit your best people away from you and send them\nto other companies that need exactly the people you have. Headhunters get paid\nhandsomely to steal your best people; you can bet they’re coming after them, so\nyou’d better make sure you know how to retain them. Depending on the size of\nthe business, a headhunter earns between $30,000 and $60,000 to place a CFO.\nThe fee to place a CEO starts at about $80,000 and may go as high as $500,000.\nThe people you recruit are also watching you closely. They are constantly\nreevaluating the bene\u0000ts program, and if it doesn’t keep up with their\nexpectations, they will start looking elsewhere. Your top people, especially, are\nwatching you to see if you’re constantly developing yourself and \u0000nding ways to\ntake the company to the next level. They want to see if you’re bringing in other\ntop talent to keep increasing the value of the company. Showing them that\nyou’re doing all these things is part of re-recruiting your best people. It can never\nstop.\n h l ll Ak( d M"

Can they tell that you are evolving?\nEveryone Needs a Consigliere: Finding\nTrusted Advisers\nEven the greatest entrepreneurs aren’t solo acts. For many reasons, they require\nhelp. They only have so many hours in a day. Their knowledge is limited to\ncertain areas. They need other perspectives to help shape their own.\nIn a Mob family, there is a position speci\u0000cally designed to provide wise\ncounsel: the consigliere. The same holds true in the business world. Warren\nBu\u0000ett may get the headlines, but Charlie Munger is indispensable to his\nsuccess. Steve Jobs had Steve Wozniak. Bill Gates had Paul Allen. Mark\nZuckerberg had Sean Parker to challenge him to expand the vision and then\nSheryl Sandberg to execute that vision.\nPatty McCord spent fourteen years at Net\u0000ix and is the author of Powerful:\nBuilding a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility. Her expertise is in human\nresource management; her title at Net\u0000ix was chief talent o\u0000cer. In my opinion,\nher greatest value was challenging CEO Reed Hastings. When I interviewed her,\nshe told a story about a time when Hastings had to deliver an important speech\nthe next day. McCord noticed a sheepish look on his face as he hammered away\non his computer keyboard.\nShe suspected that Hastings was doing what had made him successful as an\nindividual, rather than what he needed to do as a leader. She got into his face and\nsaid, “You’re \u0000xing bugs. Stop being a geek engineer, and be a leader.” Keep in\nmind that Hastings had the authority to \u0000re her. Not only did he keep her for\nfourteen years, they also used to carpool to work together. Why? Because she was\nnot afraid to challenge him and point out his blind spots.\n\f\nInsecure leaders surround themselves with “yes people.” E\u0000ective leaders\nsurround themselves with people who challenge them. They also \u0000nd and hire\npeople who are much smarter than they are—especially in areas in which they\nare weak.\nIn my videos, you constantly hear me talk about Mario. He’s one of the guys\nI depend on most. When I \u0000rst started making videos, I struggled in front of the\ncamera. Mario had this incredible way of extracting a better delivery from me\nwithout making me feel self-conscious. Even though he technically works for\nme, he wouldn’t hesitate to hold me to the higher standard we had set for the\ncontent and the brand.\nYour future consigliere is likely someone you already know. The key thing to\nlook for is similar values but di\u0000erent temperaments. If you’re impatient and\nhotheaded, you want someone who is calm and deliberate. If you’re an introvert,\n\u0000nd an extrovert. If your inclination is to be judgmental and unforgiving, \u0000nd\nsomeone who is empathetic and accepting. Regardless of temperament, it’s\nimportant for him or her to be calm and in control of his or her emotions.\nBoth in business and in life, I’m very choosy about whom I allow into my\ninner circle. One of the reasons I married my wife, Jennifer Bet-David, is that\nshe’s the only person who can calm my nerves. For di\u0000erent facets of life, I have\ncultivated a small group of people I can go to for counsel on di\u0000erent topics.\nI put so much stock in balance that when I’m in the middle of a big decision,\nI’ll often invite two di\u0000erent personalities into the boardroom to help process an\nissue. It’s most e\u0000ective when the two people are polar opposites. After I present\nthe issue to them, I simply sit there and watch them go back and forth.\nOccasionally, I’ll ask a question to stoke the \u0000re. I want to make sure I hear the\nmost convincing arguments for all sides of the issue. The clash of two opinions\nleads me closer to the truth.\nI have a friend who creates written content. He’s impatient, and his primary\nbelief is that perfection is the enemy of completion. His partner is patient to a\nfault and believes that urgency is the enemy of professionalism. Their yin-and-\nyang approach creates the perfect balance. Mario and I have a similar dynamic.\nWe don’t need to pretend to play good cop/bad cop.

    "raw_text": "There probably isn’t a more suspicious, distrustful group than the Ma\u0000a, but\nits members trusted the guy they knew as Donnie Brasco. That’s the lesson I\nwant you to absorb: you’ve got to do due diligence no matter how trustworthy\npeople seem. This is especially true if you’re going to give them access to sensitive\ninformation that you don’t want your competitors to have. Spend time with\nthem. Ask them questions. Ask others about them. Observe how they behave.\nYou can never know for sure if people are trustworthy, but you can get a feel for\nwho they are. That may be enough for you to extend trust to them, at least in\ncertain circumstances and in certain areas of the business.\nI asked Michael McGowan, a thirty-year FBI undercover agent who worked\nclosely with the Russian mob, three Cosa Nostra families, and the Sinaloa\nCartel, an international crime syndicate, why the Bonanno family had allowed\nBrasco to get that deep into the family. His answer was simple: greed. The story\nof Donnie Brasco is the perfect cautionary tale to remind you to do research\nbefore you allow someone access to insider information about your company.\nEntrepreneurs like to think that they know their people better than their\ntherapists or spouses do, but that’s just not true. You don’t know if your right-\nhand man has a secret gambling problem. You don’t know if your CFO is\nvulnerable to making bad decisions because of a traumatic event in his life.\nInstead of thinking you can see into people’s souls, start using data and a\nsystematic approach to research your new hires.\nFive Questions You Must Answer BeforeMaking Any Big Hire\n1. How many and what type of references did you call? Did you talk to other people who worked\nwith the hire about what type of individual he or she is?\n2. Is this person likable (the reason you hired him or her) but lacks a signi\u0000cant skill set?\n3. Did you conduct a background check to determine if there’s something in his or her past that\nmight be a red \u0000ag?\n4.  Did you question anything i\u0000y on his or her résumé; for instance, if the person was on\nsabbatical for two years, did you dig deeper to determine why?\n5. Does the contract you o\u0000ered include a 90- to 120-day probationary period? This will give you\nenough time to evaluate the new hire’s performance. It will also give the new hire time to learn\nwhat he or she needs to improve and make an e\u0000ort to do so.\n\f\nI can’t emphasize enough how important it is to be thorough when hiring.\nMake a bad hire, and you’ll pay for it every day. In a January 2014 article in\nHarvard Business Review, Patty McCord explained why:\nIf you’re careful to hire people who will put the company’s interests \u0000rst, who understand and\nsupport the desire for a high-performance workplace, 97% of your employees will do the right\nthing. Most companies spend endless time and money writing and enforcing HR policies to deal\nwith problems the other 3% might cause. Instead, we tried really hard to not hire those people, and\nwe let them go if it turned out we’d made a hiring mistake.\nGive Me a Piece of It: Granting Equity to\nBuild a Team\nWhy is the United States the immigration leader? Why does it have more than 44\nmillion immigrants, far more than the number two country? The United States\ndoesn’t have the largest population or the most land, but it has something that\nrelatively few other countries can o\u0000er: the chance to get equity and build\nwealth. People can come to the United States and start a business and own it;\nthey can buy a piece of land or a building and own it. This is the American\ndream, the chance to own a piece of the country.\nAs a result, the United States attracts the best, hardest-working people. Do\nyou want to attract the best, hardest-working people to your company? Give\nthem a piece of it.\nEarly in my career, I worked for a company where I was one of the top sales\nearners. I wasn’t happy with the way the company was run, and as I mentioned\nearlier, I wrote a sixteen-page letter to management. One of my requests was that\nthey give their key people a chance for equity or pro\u0000t sharing.\nWithout ownership or pro\u0000t sharing, I saw myself as an employee only. In the\nabsence of granting me stock, even as the company’s star salesman, I was an\nadversary rather than a partner. Losing me would reduce the company’s revenue\nby several million dollars. All that would be required to keep me was to give me\nthe tiniest incentive so that I would feel like an owner.\nThe management said no. Furthermore, they were convinced that I was never\ngoing to leave, given that I would lose my renewals and lucrative residual"

    "raw_text": "commissions on the several thousand clients I had on the books. My plans were\nto help grow the company to be the largest insurance agency and go on to one\nday be the CEO of the \u0000rm.\nI said, “You think my renewals are enough to keep me from leaving? You\nbelieve I think that small? You’re out of your minds.”\nI left. But the need for equity wasn’t just true for me. It’s true of anyone who\nis ambitious, dreams big, and possesses talent. I always give people working for\nentrepreneurs this advice: Go to the top person, and ask what you can do to own\na piece of the company. If he or she says, “Nothing,” leave. If he or she says,\n“Something,” stick around and hit the goals you set up together as a condition\nof ownership.\nYou’re not going to get something for nothing. Don’t say, “I’m incredibly\ntalented and accomplished, so give me a piece of the company.” You have to\nachieve to get what you want, and as long as the markers are fair, it’s a good deal\nfor both the entrepreneur and his high-performing people. It’s also not e\u0000ective\nto use leaving as a threat. The key is to ask what speci\u0000c achievements you need\nto accomplish to earn equity.\nIf you own a business, you may have reservations about granting equity. You\nmay be thinking, “Well, Pat can do this because he has a huge company with lots\nof revenue, but I’m not as big, so I can’t o\u0000er the same kind of deal.” You’re\nthinking only one move ahead. Contrast that level of thinking to a grand master,\nwho sees enough moves ahead to identify the upside. Look, I’m not telling you\nto start throwing around shares in your company. What I am saying is that\ngranting even a few shares of stock is enough to make people feel as though they\nhave skin in the game and are long-term partners.\nIf you have a scarcity mindset, you’re always thinking that there isn’t enough\nor some disaster is just around the corner where you won’t have enough.\nIf you have 100 percent conviction about your future truth, you’ll think\ndi\u0000erently. If conviction isn’t enough, do the math. Let’s say your company has\naveraged $10 million in revenue the last \u0000ve years with a 15 percent pro\u0000t\nmargin. That’s $1.5 million in net income. You decide you want to hire Johnny\nto help you grow the business, but Johnny is insisting on either an equity stake\nor a bonus. At \u0000rst, you balk at that. Johnny tells you that if he helps take the\n\f\nbusiness from $10 million to $15 million, he wants a $250,000 bonus. Your\ninitial response is that you can’t a\u0000ord that large a payout.\nYou do the math. Your net income will go from $1.5 million to $2.25 million.\nHow can you begrudge Johnny $250,000, given that increase in pro\u0000t? It’s\nessentially a two-for-one trade in your favor. Johnny’s hard work will put\n$500,000 into the company’s co\u0000ers. (This example assumes that your company\nwasn’t already growing. If it was, you would structure the incentive based on his\nability to outpace current growth. For example, if the company had been\ngrowing at 20 percent the last three years and Johnny was able to increase it to 50\npercent, that additional 30 percent would be attributed to him.)\nThe only justi\u0000cation for saying no is that you are thinking short-term. If\nyou’re still protesting, thinking that everyone in the company will want the same\nthing, your short-term thinking is digging you into a logic nightmare. Think\nabout it: What could be better than everyone in your company wanting to\ngenerate more pro\u0000t to increase both their wealth and yours?\nDo you think Bill Gates begrudges all the wealth created by those who\nworked at Microsoft? Gates didn’t give people equity. Because he was thinking\nseveral moves ahead, he granted equity to those who earned it. I read one\nestimate that Microsoft has created three billionaires (let us not forget Steve\nBallmer) and 12,000 millionaires.\nAre you starting to see that the way to build wealth is to give others the\nopportunity to build it alongside you?\nSome people are motivated by equity, some by pro\u0000t sharing, some by big\nsalaries, some by bonuses, and still others by long-term security. No two are the\nsame. The key is to create the right type of compensation plan that will attract\nand retain the kind of talent you’re looking for.\nPersonally, I favor equity and pro\u0000t sharing over bonuses, since it increases\nthe odds that the right people will be with you over the long haul (I’ll elaborate\nmore on that in the next section). Plus, just as homeowners treat their houses\nbetter than renters do, once you give people ownership in a company, their\n\f\nmindset shifts. All of a sudden, they are working for themselves and have an\nincentive to increase not only their own income but also the value of the\ncompany.\nThis may all seem like common sense, but it’s easy to be penny wise and\npound foolish. Take a European company, one of the continent’s largest battery\ncell manufacturers. It came to me because it was growing only 2 percent\nannually. When I met with the CEO, the \u0000rst question I asked was “How much\ndo you pay your salespeople?”\n“Twenty-\u0000ve hundred dollars monthly.”\n“Okay, but how much more than that can they receive?” I asked.\n“I don’t get it,” he said.\n“I mean how much in addition to their salary do they receive for\nperformance?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Nothing?”\nI couldn’t believe it. How hard would you work if all you could expect was\n$2,500 each month, regardless of your performance?\nHe changed the compensation plan, focusing on implementing a pro\u0000t-\nsharing plan. Shortly after he put it into place, the company’s growth rate\nincreased by 25 percent. Sometimes the key to growth is staring you in the face.\nChange your compensation plan so that people feel as though they’ve been\n“given a piece,” and they will work harder, longer, and more creatively.\nDon’t Give Up on the First Date: How to\nCreate Golden Handcuﬀs\nHere’s the strategy: Give your key people equity, but don’t do so immediately.\nLet them earn it.\nYou may be smart and perceptive, but no one is a mind reader. Prospective\nemployees may look great at \u0000rst glance, but you’ve got to get to know them\nbefore you make an investment in them. By creating a waiting period to grant\nequity, it gives them time to sell you that they belong there. I’m always selling my\npeople. That’s part of my job, to reenlist them continuously in our mission and"

Even if you’re going to\ndisrupt the status quo, you \u0000rst need to know what the status quo is.\n3. Find ways to create three tiers of incentives to strive for. This is much more e\u0000ective than one\nall-or-nothing incentive to compete for.\nI created a plan that allows agents to begin earning equity within two years of\nstarting. The vesting schedule is complex. When you’re ready to do this in your\ncompany, you’ll need either an expert CFO or an outside consultant to handle\nthe details.\nThe big picture is that your team will earn shares of the company and vest\nthat ownership over time. As a result, they will feel like owners, be paid like\nowners (simultaneously enriching you), and know that to maximize their\nearnings, it makes sense to stay at your company. The term golden handcuﬀs,\noriginated in 1976, means that as long as people stay with your company, they’ll\ncontinue to get their gold.\nAbove all, remember: Treat your people right, or someone else will.\nWhat You Must Recognize in Order to RetainTalent\nPeople want to be compensated properly for their e\u0000orts.\nOutstanding performers want to participate in the success of the company.\nPeople want to know that they’re part of an organization that’s making an impact.\nPeople want to be recognized in front of their peers for the work that they do.\nPeople want to know that there’s an opportunity for them to grow within the company.\nPeople want to be judged based on a clear set of expectations given to them without the\ngoalposts constantly changing.\nCommunicate Your Expectations Clearly,\nEarly, and Often\nWe often mistakenly believe that people’s character is \u0000xed. As a result, when we\nsee a new hire display bad habits, we think we made a hiring mistake. In reality,\nwe might be able to train that person to succeed. The key is to monitor his or her\nperformance and provide feedback and better communication. Letting people\nknow where they stand accomplishes three important objectives:\n\f\n1. They know the speci\u0000c actions they must take to keep their job.\n2. If they fail to perform those speci\u0000c actions, letting them go will seem fair and objective.\n3. You can begin the process of \u0000nding someone else to complete their tasks. The best-case\nscenario is the person will improve and you will have deepened your “bench.” If that doesn’t\nhappen and the person leaves, someone else can step in and take over his or her job seamlessly.\nSet clear expectations like this: “Bob, you told me you’re somebody who shows\nup on time, but three times in the last two weeks, you’ve been late.”\nBob responds, “But it’s only eight minutes.”\n“Eight minutes is eight minutes too many, and you told us you’re reliable. We\nexpect people to be punctual. I just want you to know, if that continues, that’s\ngoing to be an issue for us.”\nWhen you compromise standards at the top, you create an environment in\nwhich low standards are accepted. It’s all downhill from there.\nThis direct approach gives Bob the option of quitting before you \u0000re him—\nan option many people will take. You’re not going to bat a thousand on new\nhires. When you see that people aren’t a good \u0000t, you must be clear about your\nstandards and tell them how they’re falling short. Oftentimes, they will surprise\nyou by stepping up.\nLet’s say that Bob’s behavior continues to be a problem. When it comes time\nto let him go, he won’t be surprised because you’ve told him what he needed to\nimprove. You say, “Bob, I don’t think this is going to be a surprise to you because\nyou were late three times in two weeks, and I told you that’s an issue. Even so,\nyou continued to be late. I’m afraid we have no choice but to let you go.”\nStraight to the point.\nFor those of you who run a successful business that isn’t dependent on\npeople showing up on time, it’s an entirely di\u0000erent story. You may be in the\ncreative \u0000eld and be okay if your editors and developers show up when they feel\nlike it—as long as their work gets done. That’s \u0000ne if it works for your industry.\nHowever, if it’s necessary for employees to show up on time, you can’t\ncompromise or the bad behavior will spread.\nI tell this story to emphasize that the way you both hire new people and\nmanage them will lessen how often you have to \u0000re people, and it will lessen the"

    "raw_text": "bad feelings when you do have to let someone go. For speci\u0000c strategies on \u0000ring\ne\u0000ectively, let’s dig in more deeply.\nFire Gently. Again, Fire Gently\nOne of the toughest things for entrepreneurs to do right is \u0000re people, and doing\nit wrong can poison the company culture. Once you accept some responsibility\nfor an employee not working out, you’ll approach this unpleasant task with a\nmore empathic mindset. Don’t take it out on your employee. Instead, learn how\nto \u0000re well.\nAs you’re about to discover, this is an important but much-neglected\nentrepreneurial skill. Show me someone who burns bridges every time he\nterminates people, and I’ll show you someone who lacks empathy at best or is a\nsadist or bully at worst. The same is true of entrepreneurs who can’t pull the\ntrigger, who warn problem employees constantly but lack the gumption to let\nthem go. If you have one bad employee, his or her attitude and actions can a\u0000ect\nother employees negatively.\nLet’s draw a parallel between \u0000ring someone and breaking up a relationship. To\navoid the unpleasantness of a breakup, perhaps you have relied on classic lines:\n“It’s really not you; it’s me.”\n“Given the direction of our relationship, we both knew this day was coming.”\n“I’m the problem.”\nYou’ve tried to be amicable in order to minimize the anger, sadness, shame,\nand other strong emotions that can arise in such a situation. As an entrepreneur\n\u0000ring someone, you’re going to want to resort to similar lines: “I’m sure you’ll\ndo great elsewhere; we just have philosophical di\u0000erences” or “You’ve got a lot of\ntalent; I’m sure you’ll get another job soon, and I’ll be glad to give you a good\nreference.”\nGenerally, though, relying on classic breakup lines won’t work. People aren’t\nstupid. They are human, and that means you need to treat them with respect.\nThis isn’t just the decent thing to do. It’s not just you who is going to be giving\n\f\nthem a reference. They’re the ones who will be using social media to talk about\nyou, and you don’t want them hurting your reputation.\nDon’t drag the \u0000ring out, but don’t go nuclear, either. Time does not heal all\nwounds, nor does it make someone who is incompetent suddenly, magically\ncompetent. If you’ve given that person fair warning and he or she hasn’t\nresponded, don’t keep giving him or her repeated chances to improve. The odds\nare that he or she won’t. Have your exit meeting and make a clean break. At the\nsame time, let me warn you against employing a scorched-earth strategy. If you\nlose your temper and decide to get rid of everyone who has ever made a mistake\nor displeased you in some way, you’ll be left with an o\u0000ce of one. Remember,\ntoo, that you may be \u0000ring them because you should never have hired them in\nthe \u0000rst place.\nThat reminds me of Houtan Sarraf, better known as Hoot. I love Hoot, who\nwas one of my favorite assistants. But he wasn’t one of my favorites because he\nwas good at his job. In fact, he was probably the worst assistant in the world’s\nhistory of assistants. He was disorganized and failed to follow through on tasks.\nHe was a great guy, though, and I loved to hang around with him.\nAfter a certain point, I couldn’t tolerate his ine\u0000ectiveness, and I called him\ninto my o\u0000ce. “Hoot,” I said, “I’ve good news and bad news. Which do you\nwant to hear \u0000rst?” He said the bad news. “Okay. You’re terrible at being an\nassistant, and that’s why I’m letting you go.”\n“And the good news?” he asked.\n“I trust you. You’re a kind, wonderful human being who will do well, just not\nin an assistant position.” We talked about what he wanted to do in his life—who\nhe truly wanted to be—and he con\u0000ded that he had always wanted to surf the\nbest waves all over the world. I encouraged him to follow his dream, and for the\nnext ten years, he did just that. By teaching sur\u0000ng on the beaches he frequented\nand working in restaurants, he funded his adventure, traveling to China, New\nZealand, and Australia in search of great waves. When he returned from his trip,\nI heard endless stories about his adventures. I consider him like a younger\nbrother. I also trust that he’ll never apply for an assistant’s job again.\nPatty McCord summed up my philosophy perfectly: “If we wanted only ‘A’\nplayers on our team, we had to be willing to let go of people whose skills no"

    "raw_text": "longer \u0000t, no matter how valuable their contributions had once been.”\nSix Techniques for Becoming an EﬀectiveTerminator\nI’ve compiled this list from a great deal of experience. Please understand that you\nmay be subject to legal action when you \u0000re someone. Therefore, prior to any\nemployment termination, you should consult the company’s lawyer or HR\ndepartment, if there is one.\n1. Fire gently. When it comes time to tell people they’re through, you want to do it without\nhistrionics. You don’t have to blame. You don’t have to retaliate when your employee blames\nyou. If you bash the employee, no one will want to work for you, and if the employee bashes\nyou, you’re not going to give him the type of referral that will help him get hired elsewhere.\n2. Get right to the point. When you’re \u0000ring somebody, don’t drag it out. Though people\nmay be shocked that they’re being \u0000red and emerge from that shock to protest, don’t let the\nprocess become protracted. Don’t waste time trying to justify your actions or prove that they\ndeserve to be \u0000red. There’s no point, and you’ll end up wasting time and emotional energy.\n3. Be ﬁrm yet gentle. Yes, I’m reminding you to be gentle again because I don’t want you to\nbecome so \u0000rm that you turn into a rock and start battering people. Being \u0000rm means getting\nto the point quickly and not wavering. Remind yourself that this is not a debate but a decision.\nIt didn’t work out. Both of you have to move on. Period.\n4. Acknowledge the other person’s feelings. Say something such as “Listen, I understand\nthat this may be a bit of a frustrating and disappointing moment for you. I’ve been let go\nbefore, and I can tell you, it’s upsetting. However, I just want to make sure I totally understand\nyour feelings and what you’re thinking.” Listen to what the other person says and then\ncommunicate that you “get” the emotion he or she is expressing: “I know you’re angry…”\n5. Have a good exit strategy. A bad exit strategy is having one of your people \u0000re the\nemployee you personally hired. This is a guaranteed method to create one pissed-o\u0000 former\nemployee. But what if you hired John and he worked for Sue? Then you and Sue should be in\nthe room together when you tell John the bad news. And make the exit an interview rather\nthan a summary dismissal. Don’t kick the person out the door but ease him or her out with\ninformation and compassion. If you’re \u0000ring a supplier who works outside your o\u0000ce, that’s a\ndi\u0000erent story and you may be able to do it through a phone call. But if someone has worked\nin your o\u0000ce, you need to conduct an in-person interview before he or she leaves.\n6. Talk about the person’s strengths. This builds on the last point. Include suggestions\nabout how he or she can leverage his or her strengths to succeed in his or her next job: “You’re\nreally good at X, which means you’d be well suited to do Y.” Turn into an empathetic coach\nwho wants to help the person \u0000nd his or her next position based on what he or she does well. If\nyou take that approach, even your former employees will be fans of your company."

    "raw_text": "7\nCreate a Principles-Based Culture\nLeadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure\nthat impact lasts in your absence.\n—Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and founder of LeanIn.org\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re an atheist or an agnostic, elements of religion have a\nplace in your business. Before you dismiss this idea, let’s look a little closer. I\nactually believe there’s a lot to be learned from studying the religions of the\nworld. What two things do all religions have in common? True believers and\nrituals.\nWhat business can succeed without people believing in it? And what business\ndoesn’t have particular symbols, sayings, and credos that are part of its culture?\nGoogle is a religion. So is Apple. So are Southwest Airlines and Walmart.\nTheir CEOs won’t acknowledge it, but each company follows\n“commandments,” evangelizes through social and other media, and believes\npassionately in its business strategy and cultural norms.\nI believe in the same things, and this belief energizes my company. It helps\nsustain us when things are tough, and it emboldens us when things are going\nwell. True believers are formidable, so whatever entrepreneurial venture you\ncreate, make sure that you and your people are united by a common belief.\nHaving a great business idea and talented people isn’t enough. As an\nentrepreneur who knows the importance of strategy and talent, you might\ndisagree. I guarantee you, though, if your team doesn’t have similar principles\n\f\nand values, it will never come close to reaching its full potential. It doesn’t\nmatter if you’ve invented a better mousetrap or if you employ the best and the\nbrightest. Without shared values, you can’t sustain what you’ve built.\nIt’s one thing to know who you want to be; it’s another thing to mold an\nentire organization to a set of core beliefs that will remain in place with or\nwithout you. In this chapter, you will learn how you can achieve this.\nBuild the Principles\nRight after I started my company, I was in Hawaii with my then girlfriend and\nnow wife, and we went upstairs to our room. Hawaii is a romantic place, so\nnaturally, we did what young couples do. You know where this is going, right?\nAs I put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, I couldn’t help but think of that\n’80s hit by The System and started to sing, “Hang a sign up on the door. Say\ndon’t disturb this groove.” I secured the dead bolt and promptly got down to\nbusiness. And when I say “got down to business,” I mean that I grabbed a pen\nand piece of paper and said, “Let’s make a list of values and principles that we\nwant to live by. Let’s see how many we come up with.”\nWe came up with forty-three right o\u0000 the bat. Then we narrowed the list\ndown to ten.\nYou might think this is a weird thing to do when you’re in Hawaii with your\ngirlfriend, but as everyone who knows me will tell you, I’m obsessed with\nprinciples. When we decided to have kids, my wife, Jennifer, and I took another\npiece of paper and did the same exercise. As a result, our family has a culture. We\nstand for something. We have principles along with clear values that we repeat\nover and over.\nWhat We Stand For as a Family\nLead—because it will be necessary in every situation you face\nRespect—because everyone has something to teach you\nImprove—because that’s how you know everything will work out\nLove—because everyone is dealing with a challenge in life\n h l\n\f\nWhat We Don’t Tolerate\nBullying and being bullied\nOur Core Values\nCourage. Not being afraid to challenge others\nWisdom. Making the right choices\nTolerance. Knowing that we’re dealing with human beings, who change all the time\nUnderstanding. Appreciating and respecting that everyone has di\u0000erent ideas and values\nWe repeat these over and over. My kids get sick of hearing them. When it\ncomes to our company, my team is always making fun of me because I repeat\nthese beliefs so often. The way I see it, unless your people are mocking you, you\nhave not repeated your message enough.\nWhy am I so relentless, in both my personal and business family, about\nrepeating our principles? Because I believe in the power of reminding and re-\nreminding. I want these values and principles to be top of mind at all times for\nmy team and family.\nI’ve observed other entrepreneurs who have problems in their businesses:\npeople sur\u0000ng porn sites when they should be working, doing unethical things\nto get business, and working just hard enough to get by but not hard enough to\nexcel. Some of them have failed to clarify what they value. And some may have\nbeen clear about their beliefs but haven’t repeated them enough—and\ndemonstrated them enough—for them to sink in.\nProve What You Stand For\nI was at Nordstrom shopping with my son Dylan, who is six. He was horsing\naround and climbing on my back when a lady looked at him and started to smile.\nShe said that her kids are now older but she remembers that phase. I asked her\nthe same question I always ask parents who are older than I am: “What are three\nthings you did as a parent that worked?”\nHer \u0000rst two answers were the common ones: love your children, and give\nthem plenty of attention. The last one was about credibility. She said, “If you\n\f\nthreaten to punish them or take something away from them, do it or else your\nword loses value.”\nIn 2010, only one year after starting my company, I hired some “rogue”\nagents. As I soon learned, they were willing to cut corners and engage in\nunethical practices in order to get business. Obviously, I didn’t know they were\nrogue agents when I hired them. In fact, they seemed like great hires because\nthey were killing it—each making more than $100,000 during their \u0000rst three\nmonths with us.\nThen I started hearing about their shady methods. At that point in the\nbusiness, I couldn’t justify the expense of hiring a full-time compliance o\u0000cer,\nbut I soon realized that to balance our explosive o\u0000ense (rapid growth), we also\nneeded to play defense. The reason I hired Amour Noubarentz—he’d been my\nbranch o\u0000ce manager back in 2002—was that I knew he shared my principles. I\nasked him to look into the allegations about those new hires. Amour warned me\nthat I had to let him do his job and I might not like what I heard. There was a\nchance that those big earners might be guilty of behaviors that didn’t align with\nthe principles that I was pounding into our company’s culture. I promised him\nfree rein.\nThree months later, he presented me with evidence that our number one\nproducer had generated business in a way that was not only unethical but also\npossibly illegal.\n“You have to terminate him,” Amour said.\nDespite our earlier conversation, I was reluctant to do so. Like many\nentrepreneurs, I value people who can produce, and that rogue agent was\nproducing like crazy. As Amour shared his evidence, which included a history of\nproblems with the FBI (didn’t I tell you I’ve learned the hard way about hiring?),\nI had no choice. Firing people is always di\u0000cult, and in that case, when I met\nwith the agent and his business partner/wife, she was crying and telling me they\nhad kids and didn’t know how they could support them. I ended up taking care\nof them as best I could, but I still had to let him go. You simply can’t tolerate\npeople who violate your principles.\nAfter that incident, I started our company’s book-of-the-month club. I\ninitially assigned two books for the employees to read: Jon Huntsman’s Winners\n\f\nNever Cheat: Everyday Values That We Learned as Children (but May Have\nForgotten) and Ken Blanchard and Norman Vincent Peale’s The Power of Ethical\nManagement. I wanted to communicate to everyone that we had zero tolerance\nfor unethical behavior.\nEveryone started talking about the principles and values in the books. A few\npeople left the company because they didn’t want to work in a place where they\ncouldn’t bend the rules. For all my talk about principles, I needed to prove by my\nactions that I was committed to them. Firing our top producer and pushing\nmillions of dollars of revenue out the door was all the evidence my team needed\nto see where I stood.\nAs Dad and Dalio Say, Never Be Afraid of\nthe Truth\nSpeaking of books, the one that really mirrored my philosophy about business\nand life was Ray Dalio’s Principles. (Yes, I’m aware this is the third mention of it.\nAre you starting to see how my repetitive nature drives people crazy?) Dalio,\nfounder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, wrote the\nbook to share the guiding principles that served him in his personal and\nprofessional life. I made it mandatory reading for my entire company. I was so\nimpressed by the book that I reached out to Dalio to have him as a guest on\nValuetainment. We had an extensive conversation about his culture and\napproach to business at his headquarters in Connecticut.\nAs I expected, some people were uncomfortable with the book’s concepts,\nespecially “radical transparency.” As part of this principle, people are obligated\nto call each other out when they believe someone is making a mistake or crossing\na line. Though our company was also founded on this principle, not everyone\nwas comfortable with it. Ultimately, the book did what I wanted it to, which was\nto create productive (and often heated) discussions about Dalio’s ideas and our\nculture.\nEven Alice, our COO, confronted me and said, “This is too radical. You can’t\nrun the home o\u0000ce like you do the sales force.”\n\f\nWhen someone I respect talks, I listen. But when we processed the issue,\nthere was no data or real evidence to convince me not to be radically transparent.\nAll Alice had to fall back on was that it was too di\u0000erent. Even so, I understood\nwhere she was coming from. Because Alice had been at Paci\u0000c Life for twenty-\ntwo years, she had developed an idea of what an insurance agent should be like.\nRadical transparency was way too di\u0000erent from what she imagined.\nBeing radically transparent was a nonnegotiable for me. I told Alice I wanted\nto be di\u0000erent. I’m extremely comfortable being radically transparent; it’s being\nnormal that I can’t stand. Alice and Ian Benedict, our CFO, got together and\nstrategized with the entire team. They brought up the team’s concerns and\nshared a game plan with me. Ultimately, we decided that we needed to \u0000nd the\nbalance of respect and honesty—while staying committed to being radically\ntransparent.\nAs I was growing up, I can’t tell you how many times my dad said, “Never be\nafraid of the truth.” It stuck with me, and I instilled that value in our company. I\nhad studied many other organizations and felt strongly that being direct and\npainfully truthful were important.\nOne of the most famous case studies from Harvard Business School is about\nMorgan Stanley and Rob Parson. When John Mack became president of\nMorgan Stanley in 1993, he wanted to change Morgan Stanley’s culture and\nembrace teamwork in order to cross-sell, broaden the \u0000rm’s reach, and decrease\nall the internal \u0000ghting. The mantra that expressed his vision was “One-\u0000rm\n\u0000rm.” Employees would be judged based on a 360-degree performance\nevaluation by superiors, colleagues, and subordinates.\nParson was the classic example of a kick-ass producer and an abrasive\nteammate. He expanded Morgan Stanley’s market share in his line of business\nfrom 2 percent to 12.5 percent in a short time and took Morgan Stanley from\ntenth to second in his market. His colleagues found him to be arrogant and\nwalked on eggshells around him—which was a major issue given Mack’s\ndirective to change the company’s culture.\n\f\nMany people who read that case study thought that \u0000ring Parson would be a\nno-brainer. If Morgan Stanley was going to be true to its culture, it needed to\nput team players \u0000rst. Though Parson was a big-time producer, his behavior was\nnot consistent with the organization’s new mission.\nI saw it di\u0000erently. What I saw was a manager who was afraid to\ncommunicate directly. The case study described how the manager would\n“suggest” things and hope that Parson would get the hint. What Parson’s boss\nfailed to do was state directly and speci\u0000cally what Parson had done wrong and\nwhat he needed to change in order to keep his job. The problem wasn’t Morgan\nStanley’s culture; it was the lack of direct communication from one of its senior\nleaders.\nAs is often the case, managers are afraid to honestly tell people how they feel.\nI can understand being fearful of hurting the feelings of a star salesman. But it\nbeats the alternative. Without direct feedback and radical transparency, Parson\ncontinued treating his coworkers poorly.\nIn my view, justice was ultimately served when his manager, not Parson, was\nterminated.\nMy Business Principles\nNever compromise our nonnegotiables.\nMicromanage until there is trust.\nWhat brought us here won’t take us to the next level.\nNo one has 100 percent job security, including the founder or CEO.\nCreate positive peer pressure by challenging one another.\nBeat your prior best.\nTreat the company’s money like it’s your own.\nBe radically open-minded but not easily persuaded.\nFight any temptation to lower expectations and standards.\nCreate an environment where our team is taken care of \u0000nancially and professionally.\nIn addition to these principles, I share with my employees things that don’t\nsit well with me: feeling entitled, complaining, being negative, being pessimistic,\nleaking secrets, not taking care of one’s health, gossiping, and taking advice from\nthe wrong people.\n\f\nEstablish a Company Code\nEstablishing a company code is crucial if you want to run a thriving business. We\nhear so much about building a large network. As a result, we may forget that our\nmost important network is within our own business. People need boundaries;\nthey need to know what lines can’t be crossed. Part of the code may be that you\ncan’t poach business from one of your colleagues. Or it’s forbidden to be\ndisrespectful to your boss when he makes a request. Or, in the case of our\ncompany and Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, that you call out people—even\nthose who are above you in title and seniority—when they violate the company’s\ncore principles.\nWhen I managed my \u0000rst sales o\u0000ce at age twenty-\u0000ve, all of us there worked\nlong, hard, and late. You know what happens in a sales o\u0000ce \u0000lled with a lot of\nenergy and testosterone. That was \u0000ne, except that we established a code: If\nyou’re going to date someone’s relative, direct report, or anyone else where\nsensitivities might exist, you had to clear it with the a\u0000ected individual \u0000rst.\nNow, it wasn’t as though you’d go up to someone and say, “Hey, I’m going to\nsleep with your sister tonight.” But you owed your colleagues the courtesy of\nrequesting permission to date someone who was meaningful to them. By\nadhering to that code, we avoided creating blood enemies and the kind of\nanimosity that would poison the work environment.\nI’m a man with high testosterone. I’m extremely driven, so I can’t sit here and\ntell you I was an angel. I partied hard from age eighteen to twenty-\u0000ve, but I had\none code: my private life was private, and my choices didn’t have a negative\nimpact on the business. I wasn’t perfect, but I did my best to stick to that code.\nI share this story from a period of my life when the biggest challenge we faced\nwas the team partying together on the weekends and things getting out of\ncontrol. Fifteen years later, now that I am the founder and CEO of my own\ncompany, the code has only gotten deeper and more technical. Especially when\npeople have kids and spouses who depend on their income, the need for integrity\nbecomes even greater.\nIf you’re going to establish a culture, you have to let people know what you\nstand for. Have a clear code, a guiding set of principles, and make sure everyone\n\f\nknows, without any ambiguity, what the consequences will be for violating it.\nCreate a Replacement Game Plan\nOne of the reasons you create a culture is that it elevates everyone. It also allows\nyou to scale up faster.\nThe less your business depends on you, the more valuable it is.\nThe more your business depends on you, the less valuable it is.\nThere’s no exit opportunity if the business relies on your\npersonality.\nA company that rarely makes headlines is Microsoft. Yet in September 2019,\nit was the only public company with a market cap of more than a trillion dollars\n(at various times, Apple, Amazon, and Google have had valuations north of a\ntrillion dollars). Are you starting to notice a trend here? If your mind didn’t\nimmediately go to cultivating intrapreneurs and o\u0000ering equity, you’re not\nreading carefully enough. Now consider that thirteen years prior to the\ncompany’s reaching a trillion-dollar valuation, on June 15, 2006, Bill Gates\nannounced his decision to leave his full-time position at the company in order to\nfocus more on philanthropy.\nAt the time, Microsoft was trading at $23 a share, putting its market cap at\n$176 billion. In other words, the value of Microsoft has increased by more than a\ntrillion dollars since Gates left! Still think organizations can’t create a culture\nthat is more powerful than a visionary leader? As highlighted in a December 31,\n2019, story in Barron’s, since Satya Nadella took over as CEO on February 4,\n2014, Microsoft’s valuation has increased by $930 million. Not to be outdone,\nsince Tim Cook replaced Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, the\ncompany’s stock has increased by more than a trillion dollars.\n(Keep the dates in mind when processing these examples. Because these\ncompanies are public, their valuations constantly \u0000uctuate.)\nContingency planning sounds simple, right? But lots of entrepreneurs fail to\ndo it. They are often overcon\u0000dent, convinced that they are irreplaceable. Many\nare so egocentric that they can’t fathom the idea of anyone but themselves"

    "raw_text": "running the company. If you have that mentality, it will keep you in control and\nprevent you from scaling the business.\nAnother pitfall is thinking that your key people won’t ever leave. Or you\nbelieve that if someone does leave, someone else can just slide into his or her role.\nNeither belief is true. Ideally, you’ll have your existing employees training their\npotential replacements. If you don’t, you’ll need to have your own eye on\npotential replacements with the right areas of competence, either inside or\noutside the company.\nIf you have a plan in place for how to replace every key member of your team,\nyou can handle an unexpected exit without missing a beat. Plus you’ll sleep\nbetter at night, knowing your next several moves are already planned out.\nSix Strategies for Replacement and SkillTransfer\n1. List your tasks and skills. Make a list of all your tasks and skills and determine which ones\nyou are the best at and which ones you are not. Focus on your strengths, and replace yourself\non all the other tasks.\n2. Identify who’s seasonal and who’s not. You can’t assume that everybody is going to\nwork for you forever. You need to identify who is there to \u0000ll a six-year role and who a six-\nmonth role. If you determine that now, you won’t be surprised when someone needs to be\nreplaced.\n3. Know the diﬀerent languages spoken by your sales, support, technical, and\nexecutive teams. Sales leaders generate revenue and build a company through their e\u0000orts.\nEmployees are hired to support those e\u0000orts. You need to know the di\u0000erence between them.\nExecutives require empowering language that makes them feel autonomous and respected.\n4. Know who can maintain the company culture. It is very important that whoever\nreplaces you will \u0000t the culture you established so that the business can keep growing after you\nleave.\n5. Know your company’s practices and procedures. You need to put pen to paper and\nwrite down each department’s practices and procedures. Replacements will then have a\nmanual to follow, regardless of their level, making the transfer of speci\u0000c skills quick and\npainless.\n6. Develop leaders to help spread the right mindset. Have one-on-one conversations\nwith your future leaders to inject the company’s mindset into them now, before they need to\nreplace someone. Your having a mindset of leadership development will also increase the value\nof your company.\n\f\nEntrepreneurs need to play a continuous replacement game, replacing parts\nof themselves. At the beginning of the business, you did all the paperwork; now\nyou can hire someone to take over that task. You handled all the \u0000nancials; now\nyou can hire a CFO to do so. This gives you time to devote yourself to the tasks\nthat matter most to the business.\nMedia.net founder Divyank Turakhia, a thirty-eight-year-old with a net\nworth of $1.76 billion, once said, “Keep \u0000guring out how to replace yourself\nbecause your time is most valuable in this process. Once you \u0000gure out what\nyou’re passionate about and as long as you’re doing it, you’ll be successful in\ndoing that one thing and you keep doubling down yourself learning more.”\nFriction Is Good\nThere’s a misconception that the best company cultures include everyone\njoining hands and singing “Kumbaya,” that everyone gets along great, and that\nno one ever argues or gets upset.\nGoing back to personal relationships: Show me a marriage in which the\ncouple never argues, and I’ll show you a marriage that’s headed for a blowup. If\nyou and your spouse don’t argue, one of you has probably found someone else\nto argue with.\nWe need friction in all areas of our lives. It’s healthy, and it stimulates growth,\ncreativity, and learning.\nThat’s why I create friction when there is none and encourage you to do the\nsame. When I was still working as a sales manager, before I founded my\ncompany, I implemented a policy of calling people out. I gave a speech in which I\nsaid, “Some of you guys are going to tell me you’re upset with this guy, you\ndon’t like what he did, you don’t like what she said. Stop it! Here are the values\nand principles we’ve established. This is our code. If someone violates these\nvalues and principles, you call them out. But don’t come to me. I’m giving you\npermission to do it, even if they’re senior to you. Values and principles transcend\ntitles and seniority.”\nYou know what happened after I made that speech? Immediately, the o\u0000ce\nstarted growing, and the friction between people stimulated the growth. Positive\n\f\npeer pressure is another way to describe the environment that we created.\nEveryone was pressuring everyone else to give their best and become better team\nplayers. We were all holding one another accountable.\nI’m not saying that people started chewing one another out vindictively or\ncruelly. That’s not it at all. It’s more like the way siblings argue with love in their\nhearts but an edge in their voices and words that cut deep. And just as sometimes\na son or a daughter can call out a parent for a bad decision, the same needs to\nhappen in a company environment.\nThe key word in the expression “tough love” is “love.” You have to love\nsomeone enough to put you both through the discomfort of such conversations.\nThere are two books that will help you \u0000nd both the courage and the technique\nto navigate these types of discussions: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by\nPatrick Lencioni and Diﬃcult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters\nMost by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen. Lencioni’s book focuses\non how organization politics can lead to team failure. Diﬃcult Conversations\nguides you through how to deal with con\u0000ict and o\u0000ers speci\u0000c strategies for\nhow to tackle disputes and talk through challenging issues.\nIf you want to see an example of tough love in action, watch the YouTube\nclip titled “Joe Rogan Breaks Down Brendan Schaub.” Schaub, a top UFC\n\u0000ghter who is close friends with Rogan, was critiquing his own performance of a\nrecent \u0000ght. There was some back-and-forth: two experts talking about the\nfundamentals of \u0000ghting. Rogan said, “A lot of things looked bad about the\n\u0000ght…. You looked very sti\u0000. You didn’t look \u0000uid…. You didn’t look like you\nwere well prepared…. Your movement just didn’t look like an elite \u0000ghter’s\nmovement.”\nYou can see that at that point in the conversation, nothing was personal. It\nwas more commentary on the mechanics of \u0000ghting, which was why Schaub\nseemed blindsided by Rogan’s next comment: “I worry about your commitment\nto \u0000ghting, and I worry about where you stand.”\nSchaub tried to interrupt. “Really?”\n\f\nRogan continued by saying he thought Schaub had one foot out the door.\n“I disagree,” said Schaub.\n“The reality of your skill set, where you’re at now,” Rogan said. “I don’t see\nyou beating the elite guys.”\nRogan asked his buddy, “If you had a wrestling match with Cain Velasquez,\nhow well do you think you’d do?”\n“I think people would be surprised.”\n“I think you’d be surprised. I really do. I think he’d f—k you up…. There’s a\nbridge between you and the best guys in the world. And I don’t know if you can\ncross that bridge. That’s the reality of life.”\nAs rough as his feedback was, it felt to me that Rogan’s heart could not have\nbeen in a better place. It takes courage to look a friend in the eye and confront\nhim with the cold truth. The exchange continued, and then Rogan said, “I\nworry more about you than I do about them…. What I’m saying, I say with love.\nA hundred percent. I’m not saying this to hurt your feelings. That’s the last\nthing I want to do. If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t be willing to do this. And I\nwouldn’t want to do this.”\nSuch conversations are tough ones. No one ever said radical transparency is\neasy. No one ever said being direct is comfortable. But what’s the alternative to\nhiding the truth? Watch a loved one self-destruct without doing anything to\nstop it or, in Rogan’s case, watch his friend risk horrible injury—feeling more\nand more guilty as it all unfolds?\nI can’t tell you how Brendan Schaub processed that information. By the look\non his face, he would have much preferred going to a drug-free dentist to hearing\nthat critique. But as I said earlier, there’s the easy choice and there’s the e\u0000ective\nchoice. Rogan chose the latter. How Schaub decided to react was beyond\nRogan’s control.\nWhether in life or business, it takes both courage and skill to be direct with\npeople. Are you willing to go there in life? If not in your personal relationships,\nin your business, are you going to watch your star employee treat his coworkers\npoorly (think Rob Parson) and pray that he telepathically catches your drift?\nIf you want love without con\u0000ict, get a dog. I want it so badly that I have two\nadorable Shih Tzus, Jimbo and Kucci. But if you want to build an e\u0000ective,\n\f\nprinciples-based culture, learn not only to embrace friction but also to create it.\nTalk Behind People’s Backs\nYour parents probably told you, “Don’t talk behind your friends’ backs. It’s not\nnice.” Your parents were right. It’s not nice. But if you want to produce results,\nit can be a winning tactic.\nIn How to Win Friends and Inﬂuence People, Dale Carnegie talked about\ngiving people a reputation to live up to. Others call it identity building. If you\nconstantly praise a particular skill or character trait, a person will manifest it\nmore often. The praise, in turn, is repeated by that individual and becomes part\nof his or her character.\nLet’s say I have an employee named Garrett. I tell another employee, Lois,\nthat Garrett is brilliant at following up on requests, that he never lets things slide\nand is always accountable for his assigned tasks. Invariably, Lois tells someone\nthat I told her that about Garrett, and someone else tells another employee until\nit gets back to Garrett.\nWhen Garrett hears what I told Lois, he gets excited about the recognition. I\nlike to think of it as a positive friction. You can compliment someone like\nGarrett directly, which is \u0000ne, but when positive feedback reaches him through\nother employees, it gains a lot more weight. Garrett knows that others are aware\nof the boss’s \u0000attering remarks about his ability, and it solidi\u0000es the connection\nbetween Garrett and me and Garrett and the company. He’s going to be more\ncon\u0000dent and motivated going forward.\nProcess this issue relative to your own employees. Who has talent but lacks\naggressiveness or con\u0000dence? Have you tried and failed to encourage that person\nto be a stronger negotiator? What if you were to mention something positive\nabout that person to another employee—what would you say, and how would\nyou say it? Wait a few days, and see what happens. You’ve been trying to \u0000gure\nout how and when to motivate that employee in an impactful, lasting way. Now\nyou know exactly what you have to do.\nMake saying positive things behind your teammates’ backs a habit, not just a\nonce-a-year behavior. If you don’t do it, your workplace will lack the friction\n\f\nthat produces creative problem solving and positive peer pressure. Don’t leave\nfriction to chance. Create a culture in which you spread good words about\npeople.\nWe started this chapter by comparing corporate culture to religion. We learned\nthat great ideas and talented people aren’t enough, just as in a family, love is not\nenough. You need principles. You must write them down, repeat them often,\nand show by example your commitment to honoring them.\nI hope that studying Microsoft has provided you with a trillion reasons to\nmake culture a priority. It’s the key to scaling and the key to your business\nbecoming less dependent on you. If your primary goal is wanting to be loved by\neveryone, you’re in the wrong racket. It takes courage to have di\u0000cult\nconversations. If you believe strongly enough in your principles, you’ll \u0000nd the\ncourage needed to be radically transparent—and, as a result, incredibly e\u0000ective."

    "raw_text": "8\nTrust = Speed: The Power of\nReliability\nThe more you know each other, the more you know what each other’s thinking, the\nfaster you can accelerate the trust and con\u0000dence in one another when you get on the\n\u0000eld.\n—Tom Brady\nI am in the anticipation business. I’m in the life insurance industry, not because\npeople are going to die tomorrow but because when they do, their family is\ngoing to su\u0000er for a lack of preparation. Contracts are all about anticipation.\nAfter being ripped o\u0000 and screwed too many times, I’ve learned the importance\nof anticipating issues and putting documents and controls into place to guard\nagainst the unknown.\nI am not pessimistic about human nature. I am, however, a realist about the\ndetails of a contract negotiation. It was John McAfee, the eccentric software\nentrepreneur, who said that when a soldier is captured, he will disclose whatever\nsecrets with which he’s been entrusted—that he would give up his own mother\nunder torture. That may not be true of everyone, but I do believe that\nentrepreneurs need to be cautious about trusting just any team member,\nespecially with information that could hurt or even destroy the business.\nTrust is multidimensional, not one-dimensional.\nYou may trust one of your people to handle sales but not human resources.\nYou may trust someone with information about your current plans but not your\n\f\nfuture strategy. Trust is nuanced. For instance, I trust my enemies; I trust that\nthey’ll spin a story with the intention of trying to drive me out of business.\nSince trust is so critical to speed, we also need to ask: Why is speed so\nimportant? It almost seems too obvious to have to answer. To say it’s everything\ndoesn’t feel like an overstatement. Whether you sell a product or a service, speed\nis required to make it, to deliver it, and to go from the sale to a deposit in your\nbank account. Time is money. How quickly you do everything impacts every\npart of your business.\nIn order for a Boeing 747 jet airliner to leave the ground, it needs to reach a\nspeed of 160 knots (184 miles per hour). Just as an airplane must reach a certain\nspeed to lift o\u0000, an entrepreneur must do the same. If a plane doesn’t create\nmomentum and sustain it for a long period of time, it will crash. It needs speed,\nit needs fuel, and it needs the right pilot to guide it to its destination. Here’s how\nthe equivalent looks in business.\nSpeed = momentum\nFuel = money/capital\nPilot = founder, entrepreneur, CEO\nOnce you understand why speed is so critical, you’ll see why trust is so\nimportant for speed. Imagine if, before sitting down at a restaurant and placing\nyour order, you had to \u0000ll out a lengthy credit application. Imagine having to\nhave a mug shot taken and give your \u0000ngerprints before buying a Slurpee at 7-\nEleven. Even now, the idea of having to go inside and interact with an individual\nbefore buying gas seems like a nuisance. In short, the reason to develop trusting\nrelationships is to speed up every element of conducting business.\nI Love You, but Please Sign the Prenuptial\nAgreement\nI’ve seen a lot of people get married, and at the start, everything was beautiful.\nYou’d look at those couples and swear that they’d love each other forever. You’d\nnever guess that one day they would grow to hate each other and decide to get\ndivorced.\n\f\nAt that point, each person contacts an attorney, and what was a bad situation\nbecomes immeasurably worse—at least if you measure it in terms of rage, stress,\nand dollars spent. Attorneys often pit husband against wife, ratcheting up the\ntension in order to ratchet up their fees; an acrimonious court \u0000ght means more\nmoney for them. By the end, the couple is drained both emotionally and\n\u0000nancially.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Before you get married, you can say to your\nspouse-to-be, “I love you, but we don’t know where we’ll be \u0000ve, ten, \u0000fteen\nyears from now. Let’s plan for the worst but expect the best. That means we\n\u0000gure out right now what happens in a worst-case scenario—a divorce—in\nterms of money, the kids, and everything else.” In other words, let’s plan at least\n\u0000ve moves ahead.\nAfter a few dates with Jennifer, the woman who would become my wife (this\nwas long before our Hawaii trip), we went to a bookstore on Third Street\nPromenade in Santa Monica and bought a book titled 101 Questions to Ask\nBefore You Get Engaged. One of the questions was: How many children do you\nwant to have? I answered \u0000ve; my wife answered three. We ended up having three\nkids, which now feels like the perfect number. We made an agreement on that\nand other issues, and my wife compromised on some things and I on others.\nWe talked about all of the key marital issues in advance and hammered out an\nagreement. Prenups are great for divorce settlements, but they are also valuable\nfor marriages. By discussing key issues in advance, you can navigate the rocky\nmoments that arise in every long-term relationship.\nSome entrepreneurs say proudly, “I don’t need a contract; we have a\nhandshake deal, and my word is my bond.” That’s great, assuming the other\nperson is equally honest and forthright. Unfortunately, that’s not always the\ncase.\nThe romantics may argue that by signing a contract, you’re planning to fail.\nThe realists see it as something every smart business owner understands:\ncontingency planning. In business, you’re going to have relationships with\nemployees, partners, investors, suppliers, and advisers. You might love each and\nevery one of those people, but if you don’t have a formal agreement, you’re\n\f\nasking for the type of stress and \u0000nancial loss that comes with the most\ncontentious of divorces.\nWhen you hire someone, document everything: code of conduct, equity\nownership, salary, vesting period, probationary period. If it’s not documented,\nthere will be no plan in place when you do have a con\u0000ict. Before agreeing to any\nmajor business deal, you want the following to be agreed upon:\n1. Liability cap: What’s the most we can lose?\n2. Indemni\u0000cation: You can’t sue me.\n3. Finite term: Once it’s over, it’s over.\nLet’s return to our marriage analogy: people get married emotionally and\ndivorce logically. More speci\u0000cally, they fall in love and think love will conquer\nall the problems simmering below the surface; they don’t logically weigh the\npros and cons of marrying someone. When they divorce, though there’s\nobviously emotion involved, it’s a much more logical process: people argue\nabout what they want and what they’re willing to give. Lawyers insist on putting\na cognitive frame around emotional issues. It’s all about numbers: How many\nweekends will your kids spend with you versus with your spouse? How much\nsupport will you provide? What is a logical division of property?\nIn business, it works the same way: you fall in love with a job applicant or an\ninvestor or a supplier or a customer and you think, “This will be forever.” I can’t\ntell you how many times I’ve gotten excited about a hire, and then, a few months\nor years later, I realized I had screwed up. In every instance, when the\nrelationship arrangement wasn’t documented, the breakup was messy and\nstressful.\nOne of our investors said to me, “Look, we just gave you ten million dollars.\nWhat happens if you die? We’d like to take out a ten-million-dollar life insurance\npolicy on you.”\nI didn’t get upset and protest that I was in great shape and didn’t plan on\ndying. Instead, I loved what he said once I realized that he was telling me, “I love\nyou, but please sign the prenup.”\nAsk Questions That Go Below the Surface"

    "raw_text": "People tell me I’m demanding. When people describe me, the phrase “tough\nlove” comes up a lot. Before you can care for someone, you have to know him or\nher. I believe what sets me apart as a leader is my desire to really understand\npeople. I do so by asking the right questions and holding people accountable to\ntheir own answers.\nI recently got a call from an old colleague named Danny. He said, “You have\nno idea how reluctant I’ve been about calling you. It’s been a decade.” I was\ncurious to know where the conversation was going. When I had been a sales\nmanager, I had been especially tough on Danny. He was one of those guys who\nhad so much raw talent—brains, charisma, street smarts—and who was also so\nlikable that people let him get away with anything. As a result, he was a pushover\nwho was constantly underperforming.\nI had asked Danny, as I ask everyone else, “Who do you want to be?”\nDanny had big aspirations. He constantly talked about wanting to “retire”\nhis parents by providing for them \u0000nancially. He may have acted like the life of\nthe party, but when we got real together, he talked about wanting a big life.\nNot only did Danny want the big life, I knew he had what it took to live it.\nAnd I accepted nothing less than his best. If, in his eyes, that made me a hard-ass,\nso be it.\nWe caught up on our lives, and then I could tell he was getting emotional.\nDanny said, “I remember how you always used to say, ‘You will temporarily hate\nme, but you will permanently love me—because no one will push you like me.’ ”\n“Of course I remember,” I said. “I didn’t just say that to you. I’ve said it\nthousands of times.”\nDanny and I reminisced about how tough I had been on him and how much\nhe couldn’t stand me back then. He confessed that he had even printed out a\npicture of me and put it on his dartboard.\nI remember everything about the people who have worked for me. I\nremember their stories because I care about them.\nDanny said, “Pat, I have to tell you something.” He got quiet, and I could\nhear that he was crying. He continued, “I’m now the president of the bank. I am\nmarried. I am so happy I can’t even tell you. I’m making a multi-six-\u0000gure-a-year\n\f\nincome. And I’m here to tell you, everything I’m putting into this leadership\nposition is the stu\u0000 I learned when I was working with you.”\nHe wasn’t the only one with tears in his eyes. It was one of those moments\nthat is hard to describe, though now that I’m a parent, I’ve begun to recognize\nthe feeling.\nTalk about delayed grati\u0000cation! It took ten years for me to \u0000nd out that\npushing Danny, and not accepting anything but his best, had paid o\u0000 for him. It\nreminded me again why I’m willing to be hated temporarily—even if it lasts a\ndecade.\nSmart compensation packages and incentive trips go only so far. When you\ntouch people’s hearts, they will move mountains for you. And to touch their\nhearts, you have to take the time to understand them and know their deepest\nbeliefs and desires.\nThis means going beyond surface knowledge: your employee Joe likes \u0000shing;\nyour customer Becky is obsessed with Game of Thrones. What you want to know\nis what makes them tick. I do everything I can to get to know my team members.\nMainly, I ask a lot of questions to get to the root of who they are. In this way, I\navoid jumping to false conclusions about them and can understand what drives\nthem, what their goals are, and how they like to work.\nWhen you push people with questions, you may touch a raw nerve. That’s\n\u0000ne. This is how you get to know them. When they become emotional, they\nreveal the parts of themselves that they might be hiding.\nI can’t lead people if I don’t know who they are. I need to know their\nupbringing and what in\u0000uenced them as they were growing up. In the same way,\nmy people need to know who I am. I want people to know the truth of my story,\nthat I’m a guy from Iran who went through hell, that my drive comes from all\nthose F-you people who are still loud voices inside my head.\nIt all boils down to the willingness to ask questions—not just the expected\nones such as “How did you like your last job?” but ones that poke and probe\nand encourage people to reveal a deeper part of themselves. You’ve got to ask dig-\ndeep questions that help you discover who a person really is. That knowledge is\ngold, because it will allow you to think several moves ahead in terms of how the\nperson \u0000ts into your game plan. It’s what will help you form a productive, long-\n\f\nlasting relationship. In doing so, the trust you develop grows stronger, and speed\nfollows.\nTrust Is a Pendulum\nTypically, entrepreneurs move from trust to distrust and back again in a\npredictable pattern. It pays to be aware of this pattern, since it’s going to govern\nhow much leeway you give your people.\nWhen you hire people, your willingness to trust them is low and your desire\nto micromanage their work is high. After they’ve been on the job for a while and\nthey’ve done good work, your trust is high and you are much less likely to\nmicromanage them.\nTo a certain extent, this pendulum-like pattern makes sense, but you need to\nbe aware of which direction you’re swinging. If you’re not, you might elicit the\nfollowing reaction from an employee who feels su\u0000ocated: “If you don’t trust\nme to do the work, why don’t you just hire someone else?” Or you may wrongly\ntrust a veteran employee, someone who misses deadlines frequently and fails to\nhit his numbers. After the fact, you get upset with him, but you really should be\nupset with yourself. Why? Because you failed to hire the right person or didn’t\nproperly hold him accountable.\nReliability is the key to trust. After a while, people establish a track record.\nOnce that track record demonstrates that they will consistently deliver what they\npromise, you can leave them alone more. You have established trust.\nFour Levels of Trust\nTypically, entrepreneurs feel victimized when people betray their trust. They\nmay think they can trust someone, but then something happens: a customer\ndoesn’t come through with the big order he insisted was coming, or a business\npartner reneges on a deal. Entrepreneurs blame those individuals for lying or\ndeceiving them, saying something to the e\u0000ect of “That’s why we aren’t growing\nas fast as we should” or “We’re in a hole because Joe didn’t do what he said he\nwould.”\n\f\nNo. Don’t play the victim. The world of business is tough. People don’t\nalways play fair. Some of them are \u0000at-out crooks. Some have no problem telling\nyou what you want to hear while doing the opposite.\nThe onus is on you for allowing yourself to be hustled. You’re smarter than\nthat. In fact, you should be able to \u0000gure out the level of trust you should have\nwith anyone, be it customer, employee, business partner, or supplier.\nHere’s how to do it. First, recognize that you can categorize people according\nto the following four trust levels:\nStranger\nEndorsed\nTrusted\nRunning Mate\nCategorize people as Strangers when you have zero experience with them.\nThey may seem trustworthy; they’re charming, friendly, and talk a good game.\nInstinctively, you may like and trust them. Remember, though, that even\nhomicidal sociopaths can gain people’s trust. Experience is the best teacher. If\nyou don’t have personal knowledge of someone or know an individual who\nworked with him, put him into the category of Stranger and don’t trust him\nuntil you know more about him.\nThe Endorsed category is for people who arrive with a track record. They\nare recommended by people you trust or possess a résumé that demonstrates\ntheir ability to deliver what they promise. You still need to be wary because\nrésumés can be fudged and recommendations may re\u0000ect bias or an\nunwillingness to be completely honest. Still, this category should provide a\nsomewhat greater possibility that an individual is worthy of your trust.\nIndividuals who are Trusted are those with whom you possess personal\nexperience. One way or another, they’ve demonstrated their loyalty, honesty, and\nreliability. They are more trustworthy than those in the Endorsed category\nbecause you’ve witnessed their positive traits, not just heard about them\nsecondhand.\nThe fourth category, Running Mate, is the highest category, and you’re not\nlikely to have more than one individual who \u0000ts this description. This is the\n\f\nprofessional equivalent of your best friend. This is someone whom you can call\nwhen you have a problem or an opportunity and who will immediately ask,\n“What can I do?” If you need someone to help you out of a jam, he or she will\nmove mountains to assist.\nBefore you despair that you lack a Running Mate or start searching for one,\nrecognize that \u0000nding one can take time and experience. It took me a lot of\nbattles to discover my Running Mate. I had to learn the hard way who could be\ntrusted—and who was to be trusted absolutely. My trust had to be betrayed\nbefore I developed a mental measuring system.\nRecognize, too, that the more successful you become, the fewer people you’ll\nbe able to trust. If you’ve read motivational books or heard motivational\nspeakers, you’ve been fed a lot of propaganda about developing large networks\nof trusted people. Maybe this is true if you’re a consultant, but if you’re running\na business, you will learn the hard way, as I have, that you can’t trust everyone,\nand those you do trust, you can’t trust equally. Talk to any savvy entrepreneur,\nand you’ll hear stories about trusted lieutenants who betrayed them, about\nemployees they considered family who bolted as soon as they received a good\no\u0000er. Remember Donnie Brasco?\nDon’t expect to build big circles of trust. Forget about working with tons of\npeople with whom you’d trust your life. Instead, your expectations should be\nthat you’ll place each person in one of the four levels. Once you do, you are\nmuch less likely to be burned and will have a good idea of whom you can trust\nand how much you can trust them.\nLearn Each Individual’s Love Language\nA man can’t wait to show his wife how much he loves and appreciates her. It’s\ntheir tenth wedding anniversary, so he saves every penny to buy her a pair of\ndiamond earrings. He wraps them elegantly, and when she opens the box, he’s\non pins and needles, waiting for her to light up and thank him for his generosity\nand caring. When she \u0000nally opens the box, she barely reacts.\nThis is not what he was expecting. Her apathetic response re\u0000ects\nungratefulness and contempt. How can she be so unappreciative? When he\n\f\n\u0000nally asks her what’s wrong, she says, “I don’t know how many times I have to\ntell you that I don’t care about things. Why don’t we ever go on a picnic?”\nTo make better sense of this interaction, I recommend reading The 5 Love\nLanguages: The Secret to Love That Lasts by Gary Chapman. It’s phenomenal.\nThe \u0000ve love languages are the ways in which we give and receive love. They are:\nQuality Time, Words of A\u0000rmation, Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.\nIn the above example, the man spoke the language of gifts when, all along, his\nwife had been telling him that she preferred quality time.\nIn relationships, forget about the Golden Rule. Replace “Do unto others as\nyou would have them do unto you” with “Do unto others the way they want to\nbe treated.” It’s applicable to business, family, and friends. One of the reasons I\nchose Greg Dinkin as my book collaborator is that when I interviewed him, he\ncouldn’t stop talking about how, as part of a workshop he had given to bank\nexecutives, he had required that they take the love language quiz. In fact, I\nrecommend taking the free quiz online, and asking those close to you to do the\nsame.\nYou need to stop asking what motivates people and instead ask: What\nmotivates a person? Whether you choose to look at this through the prism of hot\nbuttons or love languages, you’d better take the time to understand what works\nfor each individual. Each of us is motivated by di\u0000erent things.\nYou have to know what makes people tick. If you’re paying attention, you’ll\n\u0000nd out. I know a CEO whose top salesman makes $825,000 a year. After his\nbiggest month, he said to his boss, “You didn’t even call me.” That statement\nmakes it obvious that he wants to be appreciated. It also tells you how he wants\nto be appreciated. His love language is words of a\u0000rmation. Had he said, “You\ndidn’t even take me out to lunch,” he would have been indicating that he\nwanted quality time. Had he asked for a Rolex, he would be indicating that he\nwanted gifts.\nDo you want to excel as a leader? Show people that you take the time and care\nneeded to understand what they want. The mistake most of us make is that we\ngive love and appreciation the way we like to receive it. If you like to receive\npraise, you’re probably good at giving it. If you’re more of a “money talks”\n\f\nperson, you probably have a great comp plan. The truth that you’re going to run\ninto is that everyone on your team is motivated by di\u0000erent things.\nPeople who make broad statements such as “Everybody likes to be\nappreciated” or “Validation is an important human need” are on the right track.\nYou need to go to the next level by getting speci\u0000c about how you show\nappreciation and validation. As a CEO, I know who needs one-on-one time and\nwho needs public praise. As a father, I know which of my kids thrives on\na\u0000ection, praise, and quality time.\nEven though I know it’s the right thing to do, I don’t always remember to do\nit. It’s not easy to meet the demands and speak the speci\u0000c languages of all your\nloved ones—especially if you’re already running a good-sized business and have a\nfamily to take care of. It can sound overwhelming sometimes, because, after all,\nwe are human.\nI read a book titled Thank God It’s Monday: How to Prevent Success from\nRuining Your Marriage that made a lot of sense to me. The author, Pierre\nMornell, was a marriage counselor, and after twenty years, he \u0000nally found the\nbest solution that worked for him and the families he was counseling: give each\nof the people closest to you \u0000ve to \u0000fteen minutes of undivided attention every\nday. I’m not suggesting you do this with everyone, but your key leaders and\nrising stars need more one-on-one time with you than you may think. It’s easy to\ntry to develop leaders just by conference calls or Zoom calls, but nothing is more\ne\u0000ective than giving them your undivided attention.\nQuestions to Ask Yourself to Reach EachIndividual\n1. What makes this person tick?\n2. How does this person want to be loved?\n3. What makes this person feel appreciated?\n4. What’s the most e\u0000ective way to show that I care?\n5. What action will best “land” on this person?\nThe Nine Love Languages of Entrepreneurs"

    "raw_text": "Remember that trust equals speed. The higher the level of trust, the faster the\nspeed. Showing people that you care about them brings out their best. As a\nresult, they become more dependable, and all elements of the business move\nfaster.\nJust as there are \u0000ve love languages in a relationship, there are nine love\nlanguages that great entrepreneurs learn how to speak with their teammates.\n1. WE NEED YOU\nGiving people responsibility is one way to show them that you need them. There\nare people who need to feel needed. In sports, a coach may go to a player who\nisn’t performing and say, “We can’t win a championship without you. We need\nyou to come through. We need you.”\nThere are also people who don’t care to be needed. The more they feel\nneeded, the more they may abuse the relationship. They may say, “Oh, you need\nme. Without me you can’t do anything.”\nWhen Steve Kerr took over as coach of the Golden State Warriors, Andre\nIguodala had started 758 consecutive games. Kerr wanted Iguodala, an All-Star–\ncaliber player, to come o\u0000 the bench. Most players would see that as a demotion,\nbut Kerr sold Iguodala on how much he was needed: there was a need for a spark\no\u0000 the bench, a need to lead the second unit, a need to bring in fresh legs to\ndefend the other team’s best player. Not only did the Warriors win the NBA\nchampionship in Kerr’s \u0000rst season, but Iguodala became the \u0000rst player in NBA\nhistory to be named MVP of the NBA \u0000nals without starting every game. This\ndemonstrates what we talked about earlier: When you give people a reputation\nto live up to, they often do just that.\n2. RECOGNITION\nIf you look at companies that are stagnant, you’ll \u0000nd that recognition is not\npart of their culture. It’s all about pressure, pressure, pressure. Dan Ariely, a\nprofessor of behavioral economics and psychology at Duke University, has done\nsigni\u0000cant research to show that companies overvalue money as a motivator."

    "raw_text": "Relying on cash bonuses to motivate people makes them feel as though they\nneed to be bribed to do their work. According to Ariely, “What it says is, ‘you\nknow the right thing to do, but you’re not interested.’ ” Giving a bonus is the\nopposite of getting speci\u0000c about what makes a person tick.\nYou can have a lot of fun with team members, especially the intrapreneurs\nwho thrive on recognition. When you recognize one, add your own personal\ntouch. For example, I gave a 1984 Olympic torch to one of our senior vice\npresidents. I gave an Ayrton Senna helmet to a VP during a time when our\ncompany was studying Ayrton Senna’s mindset. It could be signed Michael\nJordan shoes. It could be a custom Louis Vuitton bag. Sometimes it’s a plaque\nfor their wall. If they like words of a\u0000rmation, what’s written on the plaque is\nwhat matters most.\nSome people may say, “I don’t need any recognition.” The ones who say they\ndon’t need it actually need double the recognition. Their denial of needing\nrecognition is really a disguise. They’re afraid to put in the e\u0000ort because they\nmay not get the recognition they expect. I don’t care how con\u0000dent a person\nmay seem, everybody needs recognition.\n3. PRAISE: THREE DIFFERENT TYPES\nThere are three di\u0000erent ways to praise someone. Knowing which to choose has\nto do with knowing that individual. I’ll keep reminding you that everyone has\ndi\u0000erent hot buttons.\n1. Private: The \u0000rst type of praise is given privately. It could be over a meal or during a casual\ninteraction. It can also be done using text, email, or Slack. It may look something like this:\n“Listen, I just want you to know that you’ve grown a lot, and I want to recognize you. I see the\nwork you’re putting in and the way you’ve been improving. None of it goes unnoticed. Thank\nyou.”\n2. Public: The next is public. This plays on recognition and works best with people who like to\nbe in the limelight. You want to call special attention to their contributions in meetings.\n3. Behind their back: The last type of praise is given behind a person’s back. You recognize\npeople behind their backs when you praise them to others when they’re not present. I talked\nabout the power of back talk earlier. Again, know the individual to use this e\u0000ectively.\n4. CLEAR DIRECTION\n\f\nYour team needs clear direction from you. When you say things such as “You can\ndo it. Go get it,” it’s not e\u0000ective. They need you to say, “I need you to do this,\nthis, and this by this time. Can you do that?” Typically, you don’t want to give\npeople more than a list of three things to do at a time or they’ll be overwhelmed,\nbut the point is that there are plenty of people who like to be told what to do.\nFor these workers, you need to state the exact deliverable and the exact\ntimeline. Make a verbal agreement: “Are we clear, John, that you’ll send me a text\nby 4:45 p.m. EST today with the names and numbers of three di\u0000erent\nvendors?” That’s much more e\u0000ective than “Do some research and get back to\nme.”\n5. VISION\nMost people are not visionaries. It doesn’t come naturally to think ahead when\nthey’re busy putting out \u0000res. But they need to hear you talk about vision and\nthe future. Great leaders are always selling the future of where the team is going\nand what things are going to happen. They talk about what’s next. Great leaders\nsay things such as “Our greatest days are ahead of us.” Employees need to know\nthat their leader is like a grand master who is guiding them in the right direction.\nYou need to paint pictures for people about the future. Especially when\nthey’re in the grind, you have to tap into their senses and create a picture of what\nthey are working for.\n6. DREAMS\nPeople want to know how their dreams are going to become a reality. They need\nto see how doing the work today will allow them to accomplish their dreams. If\nyou want to inspire people, you must speak the dream language constantly to\nthose who need to hear it.\nThese last three are more directives and less about targeting a person’s love\nlanguage. I included them in this list because they still fall under the category of\n\f\nunderstanding people and speaking to them in such a way that brings out the\nbest in them and ultimately creates trust.\n7. INVOLVEMENT\nConstantly ask people their opinion and solicit feedback. Constantly ask people\nwhat they think you need to do next. People want to be involved in what you’re\ndoing, and they want to be heard. If you ask people for their ideas and you never\nimplement them, they will say (most likely to themselves), “Why do I even give\nthem to you? You never do them anyway. You are just wasting time for us both.”\nThere’s a danger in asking if you’re not going to actually listen.\n8. CHALLENGE\nGreat leaders challenge people all the time: privately, publicly, and behind their\nbacks. If I see somebody who is making progress after slipping up, I’m going to\npull him or her aside and say, “Listen, I want to let you know that I see it. You’re\nmaking a lot of progress. I’m excited for you. But I hope you don’t slip again. I\nhope you stay focused.”\nThe things I say publicly are to address complacency: “I was under the\nimpression that you had bigger dreams. I thought you wanted something much\nbigger. If you can make $20,000 in a month, why can’t you make $40,000? Are\nyou getting comfortable? Is your stomach full? Since when are you \u0000nancially\nfree already? Since when are we there already? Why are we behaving this way?\nWhy are we acting this way? Why are we doing this?”\n9. LISTENING\nThe last language is actually not a language. The last language is when you just\nzip your mouth and listen, since many people like to talk about themselves or\nwhat they are going through. This is not always easy, especially for an impatient\nCEO, but listening is a critical skill. Sometimes it just means sitting there and\nhearing a person out. Some of the leaders I’m mentoring just want to call and\ntalk for forty minutes. I let them. I listen, listen, listen, and take notes. I give\n\f\nthem feedback. I don’t get on the call and put them on mute and do other\nthings. I’m listening and I’ll say, “That comment you made \u0000fteen minutes ago,\ndo you still think it’s true given what you’ve heard from the rest of the team?”\nYou need to listen and show genuine interest. In fact, with all of these love\nlanguages for entrepreneurs, you need to be genuine. People can tell if it’s an act.\nIf you’re not genuine, people can tell. When you speak people’s love languages,\nthey feel appreciated.\nAn expression that you often hear in sports is that you cannot teach speed. You\ncan teach how to exploit it, yes, but speed is something you either have or you\ndon’t. Other than incrementally, it can’t be improved. In business, however,\nspeed absolutely can be improved. And you must be relentless about improving\nit. Every part of business—from identifying trends to reaching your customer to\ndelivering your product—relies on speed.\nYou can use the trust levels to \u0000lter your assessments, to understand the\nnuances of a given person or situation. In doing so, your aim is to speed up all\naspects of your business.\nThink long and hard about whom to put your faith in and why. Is John at\nthe trust level of Stranger or Running Mate? Given that, are you willing to\nentrust him with major responsibility for the business, or do you need to keep\nhim on a tight leash when you give him an assignment of any signi\u0000cance?\nAddress these and other questions, and you’ll \u0000nd that you can \u0000gure out who\nto trust—and who not to—with great accuracy.\nThe point of creating trust is to increase speed. Analytical people often miss\nthis point. They also miss the fact that the key to building trust is to tap into\npeople’s humanity. Once they know that you see them as human beings and not\nsimply as employees, trust grows and speed builds. Understanding their love\nlanguages and what makes them tick are the keys to showing you care."

    "raw_text": "9\nScaling for Exponential Growth\nI am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led\nby a lion.\n—Alexander the Great\nIn the United States, you can register any business for less than $200. You can\nthen call yourself a CEO. You can even order business cards with the letters\n“CEO” in big, bold print. You can call yourself whatever you want. It’s when\nhundreds of other people call you a CEO that you’ve earned the title.\nIn October 2009, I launched a business with sixty-six agents. In our \u0000rst full\ncalendar year, we did less than $2 million in revenue. There was one small\nproblem: as the CEO, I had no idea in hell what I was doing. I had yet to learn\nwhat it takes to scale.\nFor my entire professional career, I had been either a salesperson or a sales\nmanager. I had never been the chief executive o\u0000cer of a company. I knew\nnothing about vision or strategy, much less all the logistics and paperwork that\nare required to turn a sale into a contract. I basically faked it at \u0000rst, trying to\n\u0000gure things out. I started searching, thinking what moves I had to make to\nsucceed as CEO. The \u0000rst move was joining Vistage, an organization for\nentrepreneurs in which Vistage essentially becomes your personal board of\ndirectors, providing you with advice. I also attended a program at Harvard for\ncompany owners/presidents that enabled me to interact with other CEOs and\nlearn about management."

    "raw_text": "2. Survival\n3. Momentum\n4. Plateau\nAs you read this, you need to ask yourself what phase you’re in. Formulation\nphase? Survival phase? If you haven’t reached the momentum phase, it’s because\nyou have yet to \u0000gure out what leads to exponential growth. You’ll soon discover\nthe two things that will lead to your business catching \u0000re.\nCapitalizing Your Business\nNo matter what stage your business is in, you need a plan for capitalizing it.\nWhen you’re starting out, will you borrow from family? Should you \u0000nd an\nangel investor and give up equity? Once you start crushing it, should you look to\nexit or will you leverage your success to raise funds and grow even faster?\nThis topic could be a book in and of itself. It’s also very industry speci\u0000c. If\nyou’re building a tech company that doesn’t have a measurable method of\nmaking money but can attract tens of millions of eyeballs, such as Twitter,\nInstagram, and other such companies, you need to raise as much capital as\npossible up front. In other industries, you are better o\u0000 growing organically.\nIn April 1999, Jack Ma started Alibaba in his apartment. It wasn’t until\nJanuary 2000 that the company received a $20 million investment from a group\nof investors led by Softbank Corporation. The Wall Street Journal reported that\nMa’s meeting with CEO Masayoshi Son was atypical of most investment\npitches. Ma said, “We didn’t talk about revenues; we didn’t even talk about a\nbusiness model. We just talked about a shared vision. Both of us make quick\ndecisions.”\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose that aired on a 60 Minutes Segment Extra,\nJe\u0000 Bezos re\u0000ected back to 1995 when he was raising seed capital to start\nAmazon. “A lot of people did very well on that deal [laughs]. But they also took\na risk, so they deserve to do very well on that deal. But I had to take sixty\nmeetings to raise $1 million, and I raised it from twenty-two people at\napproximately $50,000 a person. And it was nip and tuck whether I was going to\nbe able to raise that money. So, the whole thing could have ended before the\n\f\nwhole thing started. That was 1995, and the \u0000rst question every investor asked\nme was: ‘What’s the internet?’ ”\nDuring an interview at the George W. Bush Presidential Center’s Forum on\nLeadership in 2018, Bezos also talked about raising money to start Amazon. He\nsaid, “And that was in 1995. But just two years later, a Stanford MBA with no\nbusiness experience could raise twenty-\u0000ve million dollars with a single phone\ncall if they had an internet business plan.”\nThere are many avenues to creating a well-capitalized company. I’m going to\ngive you ten questions to ask before you start to raise money. If you’re serious\nabout doing so, don’t just read them; answer them.\nTen Questions to Ask Before Raising Money\n1. Should You Even Raise Money?\nIs your company at the point where you should even be considering raising\nmoney? Your idea could be small enough that you could bootstrap it with your\nown money and get it started today.\n2. If You Were Not Able to Raise Money, How Would You MakeYour Business Idea Work?\nIf you can answer this question, Angels and VCs will be more interested in your\nbusiness. By demonstrating that you don’t need capital and gaining momentum\nbefore you try to raise money, you will become a more attractive investment.\n3. How Will the Money You Raise Be Used?\nWhen raising money, you need to put yourself into investors’ shoes. Investors\nwant to know how you will use the money. You need to show them how you will\nconvert cash into growth. Whether the money will be used to make a key hire,\nramp up production, or secure intellectual property, they need to see your plan\nfor putting it to use.\n4. What Does an Ideal Investor in Your Business Look Like?\nIs it somebody who’s involved? You need to think about not only who a\nprospective investor is as a person but also what type of relationship you want\nwith him or her. Do you need someone to make key introductions that open up\n\f\ndistribution channels? Or do you need someone who has speci\u0000c experience you\nlack and can act as an adviser?\n5. Do You Want to Keep Total Control of the Business?\nWhenever you ask for money, it comes with a lot of expectations. People don’t\nwrite checks without making demands. Prepare yourself to either retain full\ncontrol of your business and possibly not be able to raise as much money or cede\nsome control in order to get a bigger cash infusion.\n6. Do You Want Accountability?\nMost entrepreneurs don’t like other people telling them what to do. But venture\ncapitalists want to do just that. They want to work with nimble entrepreneurs\nwho are open to suggestions about their business. Do you view this as guidance\nor meddling? If the latter, look for a more passive investor, such as a bank.\n7. Have You Done Enough Research About Your Industry?\nDon’t waste investors’ time by failing to do your homework. You need to know\nwhat your industry looks like before you go out to raise money. It will show\npotential investors that you are serious and prepared to use their money wisely.\n8. What Makes Your Business Model Diﬀerent?\nInvestors need to understand why your business stands out. Your company needs\nto be positioned so that it will have a distinct competitive advantage in the\nmarketplace.\n9. Have You Done the Math? What Is the Value of YourCompany?\nThe moment you present bad math, investors are going to walk away. They are\nexpecting you to have real projections and to back up your valuation with sound\nnumbers. Know the industry comparisons, and use “comps” (comparable\nbusinesses) for multiples of revenue, sales, or other industry-speci\u0000c metrics.\n10. Are You Building to Sell?\nInvestors want to know if they will be able to sell their investment for a solid\nreturn in \u0000ve to seven years. Do you have an exit strategy? Some VCs don’t want\n\f\nto invest in businesses that are built to sell. Others are looking for quick returns.\nYou need to do your homework to determine this.\nIt’s a huge boost to you and your team’s con\u0000dence to get venture funding.\nLook at raising money as buying a longer life span. It’s like playing a video game\nin which you have just scored two more lives in case you die. Having smart and\ndemanding people invest in you creates accountability and can lead to high-level\nintroductions and wise counsel. It makes sense for some people. As with\neverything else in business and life, you will pay a price for these advantages.\nUsing your own funds, by contrast, often puts you at constant risk of running\nout of money. The upside is that you get to keep control of your company and\nyour equity in it—which ultimately gives you even more choices.\nIn terms of connecting with money people, the best way to \u0000nd investors is\nthrough your mentors. Having a person introduce you will go a long way toward\nlegitimizing you.\nThe best way to gain credibility with your mentors? Answer the ten\nquestions thoughtfully and in great detail. Doing so will prove that you are\nserious and prepared.\nThere’s no perfect time or method to raise money. You have to do great work\nwhile keeping track of your options. It’s better to attract than to beg. Now that\nwe’ve covered raising capital, let’s move on to growing your business.\nThe Strategy Quadrant\nHave you ever gone to the gym and seen the same person there every time, but\nfor some reason, you never see him or her making progress? How is it even\npossible that that person works out so much but continues to look the same? It’s\npossible, all right. In fact, it’s normal. Whether in the gym or the o\u0000ce, most\npeople show up and just go through the motions. They work in their business\nbut not on their business. If you do the same, at best, it will keep you a\u0000oat. At\nworst, your lack of thinking several moves ahead will lead to your company’s\ndemise."

    "raw_text": "Growth is important, but entrepreneurs often treat it as the only function,\nand that’s a mistake. Two types of business growth exist: linear and exponential.\nThe former represents steady but not spectacular gains: you meet deadlines, sell\nand maintain customers, and expand your network of contacts. The latter\nrepresents quantum leaps. It’s what happens when entrepreneurs step out of the\nday-to-day running of the business to do something exceptional. They have a\nvision and are able to make tough but smart decisions to implement that vision.\nThey don’t just want to grow incrementally; they want to conquer the world.\nI’ve boiled down the responsibility of an owner or CEO to these four\nstrategic areas:\nThe linear growth side is operating systems and business development/sales.\n1. OPERATING SYSTEMS\nThis is about tightening up your systems, technology, and processes, making\nthem more e\u0000cient and e\u0000ective. To most entrepreneurs, this is the least exciting\npart of the business. And although it won’t create exponential growth, you can\nstill make great strides by improving your operating systems. You saw how my\ncompany broke down ITR and how improving operations through technology\nultimately saved us millions of dollars."

    "raw_text": "A business fails for one of two reasons: either it grows too fast, or it doesn’t\ngrow at all. Though the former seems like a good problem to have, it can be fatal\nif you don’t have the operating systems in place to support your growth.\n2. BIZ DEV AND SALES\nNext are business development (biz dev) and sales. This has to do with creating\nrelationships with new vendors and new partnerships and making your sales\nprocess better. It’s about networking and attending events from your industry.\nRelationship, relationship, relationship.\nBiz dev is linear. You have to close deals and continue to grow your accounts.\nThe next two areas lead to exponential growth.\n3. THE NEXT INNOVATIVE CAMPAIGN\nAs CEO, you may launch a program or promotion that is potentially game\nchanging. Bally Total Fitness did this when it introduced zero-down-payment\ngym memberships at a time when its competitors all required a sizable down\npayment. In 1995 Continental Airlines introduced an incentive program in\nwhich each of its 35,000 nonmanagerial employees received $65 in any month\nthat Continental ranked among the top \u0000ve airlines for on-time departures.\nThat innovative campaign, led by transformational leaders Gordon Bethune and\nGreg Brenneman, worked like magic. Bethune described it in detail in his book\nFrom Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental’s Remarkable Comeback.\nIn 2005, when the price of gas was around $3 a gallon, Mitsubishi launched a\ncampaign to pay for its customers’ gas for an entire year. Though it was really\nnothing more than a discount, it was marketed in a way that turned heads.\nWhen Hyundai, the Korean car manufacturer, was struggling to gain market\nshare in the United States, it o\u0000ered the most extensive warranty in the industry:\nten years or 100,000 miles. Those were not day-to-day operational decisions that\nmade a small impact; they were choices that led to exponential growth.\nIn February 2005, Amazon launched Amazon Prime. For $79 a year,\nmembers would get free two-day shipping on all purchases. The company later\n\f\nadded music, free movies, and free delivery of perishable goods. As of September\n2019, there were more than 100 million Prime members. At the present cost of\n$119 per year, that’s $11.9 billion in revenue. Now, that’s an innovative\ncampaign.\nMaking the right move can create a massive surge in your business. You have\nto synthesize everything you know about your customers’ wants and needs, your\ncompetition’s limitations, and your own strengths to create a campaign that will\ndrive rapid revenue growth.\n4. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT\nExponential growth depends on your ability to develop other people into\ne\u0000ective leaders.\nIdentify the next leaders you’re going to groom for more responsibility. Make\na list of your top three, \u0000ve, or however many you have. Then start assessing\nthem. Look at their strengths and weaknesses, and how they respond in di\u0000erent\nsituations. Then look at their level of competitiveness, their ability to come up\nwith ideas, and how solid they are. Also ask them if they believe in the company\nand want to step into a leadership role.\nNext, sit down and identify what they need to do in the next six months,\ntwelve months, and two years. Challenge them to grow. Figuratively speaking,\npour water onto them as though they were plants.\nAs the CEO, you will be judged based on the type of leaders you develop.\nFinding others who can build the business on their own rather than just\nfollowing marching orders will lead to exponential growth. This requires \u0000nding\nthe right type of people to recruit and making leadership development a high-\nlevel priority.\nYour Challenge\nMost people stay at the linear level. Just because you chose to become an\nentrepreneur, that doesn’t make you a visionary or a CEO. If you spend most of\nyour time in the linear quadrants, you are not going to build much momentum."

    "raw_text": "If, on the other hand, you spend all of your time in the exponential quadrants,\nyou run the risk of not being able to support your growth.\nYou need to look at the strategy quadrant and ask yourself where you are and\nare not doing a good job. Where do you need to pivot? Do you need to create an\ninnovative campaign? Maybe you need to look at the next ninety days and\nprepare for your next innovative campaign.\nYou’ll be amazed by how gratifying putting together a strategy for your\nbusiness can be. It’s exciting when your business grows and money starts coming\nin. Once that starts, let me tell you, it gets very, very interesting.\nTo Improve Your Employees’ Performance,\nApply Pressure to the Point of\nDesensitization\nHow can you get your people to perform at peak capacity? How can you\nmotivate them to make signi\u0000cant improvements year after year?\nThese are tough questions for entrepreneurs. Maybe you try to be your\npeople’s best friend. Maybe you provide tough feedback. Maybe you o\u0000er\nsupport and encouragement. Lots of theories are \u0000oating around about this\nsubject, but I know what works for me, and if you can get past your desire to be\nliked, I bet it will work for you, too.\nI have a friend, Chris Hayes, who played defensive back in the NFL for seven\nyears. Chris played for a number of famous coaches, including Herm Edwards\nand Bill Parcells. One day I asked him, “Who was the most di\u0000cult coach you\nplayed for?”\nChris didn’t hesitate. “Bill Belichick,” he said.\nAt the time, Belichick was an assistant to Parcells for the New York Jets.\n“It’s not even close,” Chris said. “His expectations were so high. It was\nincredibly annoying. Training and practice were freaking insane. He wanted you\nto be as close to perfect as possible for everything. He would pick on you for the\nsmallest thing. But you also knew you were going to win because you knew he\nwanted to win more than anybody else in that room, so you didn’t have a\nproblem following him.”\n\f\nEntrepreneurs can learn a lot from Chris’s experience with Bill Belichick. I\nknow I have. I apply pressure to my people until they become immune to it. I\n\u0000gure if they can put up with me, they won’t have a problem with the grief they\nget from customers. If they can handle me, they can handle anyone. They don’t\nget rattled. They become better leaders when they’ve been through my pressure\ncooker, and they can handle con\u0000ict better.\nThe way I apply pressure is by asking questions—and waiting for the\nanswers. I challenge my people the same way I’m challenging you. I ask them to\nbecome clear on who they want to be and describe their next moves in detail.\nOnce they express what they want, I use their answers to keep them accountable.\nI don’t yell and scream. I don’t impose my own goals on them. What I do is\nrepeat what they said they want to accomplish. If they are falling short of their\ngoals, I ask why and shut up. I’ve found that getting them to self-re\u0000ect is much\nmore powerful than telling them what to do. Ultimately, I’m teaching them to\nbe accountable to the high expectations they set for themselves.\nMost people don’t want this accountability. Being held to the standard of\nbeing your best self is not for the faint of heart. That’s why, by design, I’m not\neasy to work for. It takes a few years for people on my team to become\ndesensitized to the pressure, but when that happens, they’re golden. Like\nBelichick’s players, they feel the intense pressure of high expectations, and\nthough they resent it at \u0000rst, they become accustomed to it. They eventually\nrealize that it’s elevating their performance, and it results in wins for the team.\nAfter a while, the pressure no longer bothers them.\nAnd here’s an even bigger bonus: the domino e\u0000ect. When I apply positive\npressure to one person, he applies it to another. When we add more people to\nthe team, we apply the same pressure to them, and they in turn apply it to\nothers. Instead of a management practice, it becomes part of the culture.\nRemember that you are not doing this to hassle your team, but rather to apply\nthe right kind of positive pressure.\nBill Belichick has won six Super Bowls as head coach of the New England\nPatriots. Do you think quarterback Tom Brady would describe playing for\nBelichick as a picnic? Of course not. In fact, because Belichick was so hard on\nBrady, there was a multiplier e\u0000ect.\n\f\nWhen the star is challenged, everyone has to raise his game as well. As\npressure is applied and expectations are raised, this becomes the norm. Even\nthough Brady left to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after twenty seasons with\nBelichick and the Patriots, it’s fair to say that Brady and Belichick had the best\nrun of any coach-and-quarterback tandem in history. Credit Belichick for\napplying pressure and Brady for responding to it.\nMany options exist for applying pressure: providing constructive criticism,\nincreasing results targets, asking tough questions. Keep the pressure constant by\nasking questions that create accountability, and you’ll see how people will raise\ntheir game.\nI realize that this might sound a bit tough and could scare some people, so I\nwant to emphasize that it’s not something that works for everyone. It has to \u0000t\nboth your personality and your philosophy. It will also depend greatly on your\nteam and culture. Again, I’m just sharing what works for me. By now I trust you\nto process what I say and use your own approach.\nVisionary Leaders Have a Reality Distortion\nField\nA common theme in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs is Jobs’s reality\ndistortion \u0000eld. Rather than accepting others’ ideas of reality or “being good\nenough,” he created his own stories and pushed others to make them true. He\nimposed his will on others to reprogram their expectations of themselves. And\nbecause he was not willing to accept the reality of their self-imposed limitations,\nthey ended up surprising themselves.\nBeing around strong CEOs who are always raising their standards can be\nuncomfortable. They project a feeling that no matter how hard you are working,\nit’s not enough. People may say, “Every time I get somewhere, you move the\nmarker. When are you going to be fully happy?” That’s what makes a strong\nCEO so e\u0000ective. That’s why Jobs may have been loathed when he was imposing\ndeadlines but is now revered.\nPardon this quick digression, but the misconception about people getting\n\u0000red is funny to me. Most people think that the day-to-day employee has the"

    "raw_text": "highest chance of getting \u0000red, but the reality is that no one is \u0000red more often\nthan the company founder or CEO. Every time an employee quits, for the CEO,\nit’s a form of getting \u0000red. Every time a customer leaves to go to a competitor,\nit’s a form of getting \u0000red. Every time a superstar salesperson leaves, it’s a form of\ngetting \u0000red. Every time the company is sued, it’s a form of getting \u0000red. My\npoint is that no one is \u0000red more often than the CEO.\nWhen a CEO/founder loses his job, bankruptcy often follows and he or she\nloses everything, whereas an employee loses only a job and simply needs to \u0000nd a\nnew one. It’s important for your team to know that no one is under more\npressure than the CEO. This is not to undermine them but to let them know\nthat the pressure is shared by everyone.\nHere’s an example of how I challenge people. I was meeting with a group of\nemployees, and I asked them, “How many of you want a raise?”\nEveryone said they wanted a raise.\n“Okay, now do me a favor and write down the most money you ever made in\na year. Don’t show me; just write it down for yourself.”\nAfter they did it, I said, “Now write down how much money you would like\nto make annually.”\nAgain I waited; then I asked, “Why haven’t you made that number yet? Is it\nthe company’s fault? Do you want me to give you the kind of answer that makes\nyou feel good? Or do you want the truth?”\nThey asked for the truth.\n“It’s because the market determines our value. We can think we’re worth\nmore, but if the market isn’t willing to pay for it, then maybe you’re overvaluing\nyourself. That number you wrote, you have to go out and get it. It doesn’t\nhappen just by luck. Do you want to be a supervisor? Do you want to run a\ndepartment? Then you have to ask yourself what you need to do to increase your\nvalue in the marketplace. The people who stay with us long-term are constantly\nimproving themselves. We encourage improvement. And if you don’t improve,\nothers are going to outimprove you and become your boss.”\n\f\nAll this ratchets up the pressure, the expectation, and the performance.\nThe next step is to create the environment that allows employees to self-\nre\u0000ect and chart their own course. I’ll ask them to list their next \u0000ve moves. I’ll\nask them to email me their moves if they are committed to being held\naccountable. By doing so, they have set the bar for themselves and given me\npermission to hold them accountable.\nSet Your Lions Free, and Empower Them to\nBuild Empires\nThe philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said, “If a lion could speak, we could not\nunderstand him.” You have to learn how to deal with lions (standout\nperformers). Lions build empires, and they lead people. They’re also going to\nprovide the most revenue and the most headaches. They’re demanding and\nshort-fused. At times, it may seem as though they have no feelings. Many are\ndisorganized and seem to be all over the place.\nRob Parson was a lion. He crushed it for Morgan Stanley, and because\nmanagement didn’t know how to handle him, the company almost lost him.\nYou can lose sheep. They’re a dime a dozen. But you cannot lose lions.\nGreat companies are \u0000lled with many lions who run their own empires.\nBefore I started my agency, I was a lion working for a big company. I was\naggressive. I was brash. Remember that I was the guy who wrote a sixteen-page\nletter to management and demanded changes. If that leadership team had\nknown how to deal with a lion, they could have harnessed all of my aggression\nand lined their wallets. I was ripe for becoming an intrapreneur and making a\nsmall fortune for myself and a large fortune for the company. But they had no\nidea how to treat me. So I left.\nThe key to dealing with lions is challenging them. Even star players, in the\nheat of the moment, will get annoyed by their coaches. It’s not fun to be pushed\nbeyond your pain threshold. Yet these same players ultimately bestow praise on\ntheir coaches. Why? Because they are lions, and lions thrive on being pushed\nbeyond their pain threshold."

    "raw_text": "If you want to be liked, if you \u0000nd delight only in making people\ncomfortable, you’re not cut out to deal with a lion, much less be a CEO. People\nmay hate you in the moment, but the only way for them to thrive and your\nbusiness to survive is to hold them accountable.\nSeven Ways to Hold People Accountable\n1. Don’t be afraid to hold people accountable and call them out when they don’t\nkeep their word. Make it very clear that it’s not personal; it’s their performance you don’t\nlike, not their personality. And be gentle.\n2. Ask why, and stay silent long enough to listen to their answers. When you don’t\nget a good explanation for why an employee has broken a promise or missed a deadline, ask\nwhy. Get a speci\u0000c answer. You need to go deep to \u0000nd out what’s really going on. This is the\nonly way you are going to gain from the conversation.\n3. Make speciﬁc quantitative statements, not blanket qualitative ones. Don’t just\ntell your employees to work harder or get better. Give them speci\u0000c challenges to meet that can\nbe measured and have deadlines.\n4. Provide clear metrics and specify clear incentives. Let them know what they will get\nfor hitting (or missing) their metrics. Numbers don’t lie. You will avoid future con\u0000icts by\nbeing clear about the goalposts.\n5. Coach your people through the workﬂow. It’s not enough to tell them what to work\non. You have to coach them through how to work on it. Make sure they have the resources and\nthe expertise to complete the task.\n6. Know the role each person plays on the team. How will accountability a\u0000ect others\non the team? Who else might you also need to hold accountable to make sure that person\nsucceeds?\n7. Finish with heart and empathy. Know that we are all human beings with feelings. People\ngo through things in their lives that we’re not aware of. You can be \u0000rm and compassionate.\nWhat’s notably missing from this list is who will be keeping you accountable.\nPeople at your level or lower are not going to be tough on you. Don’t look to\nthem to hold you accountable. Find someone you respect who is willing to keep\nyou accountable on a weekly basis. In some cases, it might be your manager. If\nyou’re an entrepreneur, it could be an investor or a board member.\nOrganizations such as Vistage and YPO (Young Presidents’ Organization) can\nprovide a sounding board and advice. It’s up to you to take it to the next level by\nseeking out people with whom you share your big goals and who will agree to\nhold you to them.\n\f\nMake a list of the people who hold you accountable. What’s their level of\ncredibility? If those who hold you accountable rank low in credibility, why have\nyou chosen them?\nYou may be ready to make the move to CEO. To do so, you need to have enough\ncapital to run your business. As we discussed, choosing the best option requires\nyou to balance the amount of control (and equity) you’re willing to give up with\nthe amount of accountability you’re willing to accept.\nOnce your company is properly funded, your focus will turn to growth.\nYou’ll need to execute both linear and exponential strategies to build\nmomentum and maintain it. Your next innovative campaign will be the catalyst\nfor your business to expand. Developing leaders will also create exponential\ngrowth, albeit at a more predictable pace.\nLet’s also not forget that the most important resource you will ever have is\nthe people around you. If you think the world revolves around you as a CEO,\nyou’re in deep trouble. Without your people, you have a job, not a business.\nYou have to really care about your people. They will see through \u0000attery.\nThey will respond to sincerity and authenticity, and the best way to provide\nthem with that is by asking thoughtful questions. Do you think about their\ndreams, goals, and purpose? If you do, you’re going to end up becoming a great\nCEO one day.\nThe number one product of all is human capital. You have to know what\nhappens when one person is down, why another is not all in, and why a third is\nbeing a little forgetful. Take a person who is having problems out to lunch and\ntalk to them and ask, “Is everything okay? How is your wife doing? Are the kids\ngood?” Good business is about relationships.\nIf you’re reading this and saying “I have a lot of work to do!” know that all of\nthis work is going to take years. Don’t expect to become good at this overnight.\nIt’s a never-ending process that relies on your never-ending desire to keep\nimproving. One day, you won’t just be one of those people who calls himself a\n\f\nCEO just because you registered a business and bought business cards. You’ll\nknow you’re a CEO when other people start looking at you as one."

    "raw_text": "10\nMake Momentum Your Friend—and\nBe Prepared for Chaos\nThe feeling that everything is about to fall apart. That panic is precisely what growth\nfeels like.\nYou’ll want to escape that terrifying feeling as fast as possible. Your brain thinks that\nyour body is in danger, and the most important thing is to get rid of that danger, to\nend the tension.\nYou’ll want to run away… that’s the critical moment when most people lose. The\nkey is to recognize when you feel this way, and to lean even deeper into those moments.\n—Seth Godin, blogger, entrepreneur, and best-selling author\nTo accumulate wealth, success, and power, you need to be like a basketball team\non a ten-game winning streak. You’re rolling and gathering momentum as you\nroll. Dictionary de\u0000nitions of “momentum” describe it as the product of the\nmass and velocity of an object. Translated into entrepreneurial terms, it’s the\nproduct of who you are and the speed at which you’re moving forward.\nWhen you’ve gathered momentum, you become a force rather than just a\nbusiness. You may not be unstoppable, but no sane person wants to get in your\nway. You’re barreling forward with increasing con\u0000dence, talent, and money.\nGet serious about creating momentum. Treat it like a person you’re dating\nwho seems like “the one.” With every date, the relationship builds. Each time you\nsee him or her, it’s better than the previous time. It’s not just physical; emotional\nintimacy and mutual respect develop.\n\f\nThe fastest way to lose momentum is to abuse it. Your “twin \u0000ame” keeps\ntelling you that you’re the best. And you believe it, get cocky, and start to sleep\naround—foolishly believing that that person will always be there. Then, boom!\nJust like that, there goes the momentum, there goes the relationship. You’re all\nalone, feeling humiliated and having to start climbing uphill again, which is even\nharder now that you’ve proven you can’t be trusted.\nI’ve seen the equivalent of that scenario in business far too many times. It’s\nwhy, in this chapter, we talk about both the power and the danger of momentum.\nIf you implement the right innovative campaign and develop leaders, you’ll gain\nmomentum. The challenge will be maintaining it. Many entrepreneurs have been\nsuccessful; not so many have stayed that way. The di\u0000erence is discipline. Just as\nmomentum increases your power, it can blind you to your weaknesses. First we’re\ngoing to talk about how to create momentum. Then we’re going to talk about\nhow to manage it.\nIf you need further motivation to maintain your momentum, consider this:\nThe average entrepreneur starts to feel godlike when momentum is continued. It\ncan be transformative, so be disciplined and don’t let it falter—but don’t let it\ngive you a massive ego, either.\nIf You Overdose on Anything, Overdose on\nSpeed\nIf there’s one expectation I have of the people with whom I work, it’s this: I will\nnot compromise on speed, execution, or e\u0000ciency. I don’t care how much bigger\nwe get; I want speed, I want execution, I want e\u0000ciency. I am greedy in these\nthree areas. I want them all.\nHere’s a huge question for leaders: How can you reduce the time it takes to get\nthings done? Too often, entrepreneurs don’t understand how to increase speed.\nInstead, they say, “We’re going as fast as we can; no way can we do it measurably\nquicker.” Or “Sure, we can reduce our time frame, but that means spending a ton\nof money on hiring more people or installing better systems.”\nThat’s not acceptable.\n\f\nI would never suggest compromising quality for speed, but I’m going to give\nyou a better way to create speed so that your quality doesn’t su\u0000er (and, in fact,\nshould improve). Let’s start by talking about Ferraris. Consider three versions of\nthe car produced in di\u0000erent years: 1977, 1997, 2017. Here’s how long each of\nthem took to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour:\n\f\nIf you look at this trend, what would you project the 2037 Ferrari might be\ncapable of?\nIt seems impossible to be able to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in the blink of\nan eye. No doubt, people in 1977 said, “No way a Ferrari could ever do it in 4.9\n\f\nseconds.” No doubt, people in 1997 said, “No way a Ferrari could ever do it in\n2.9 seconds.”\nWhen you think about the various functions of your business—sales, hiring,\ncustomer service, whatever—what can you do to compress your time frame? It\nmay sound di\u0000cult or even impossible, but I guarantee you that there’s a way to\nreduce the time it takes to perform any function.\nAnd before you protest that you’ve done everything you can, let me tell you\nanother auto-related story. As I read in Je\u0000rey Liker’s book The Toyota Way, the\ncatalyst of Toyota’s success was the decision to address every problem that arose\non the assembly line in no more than \u0000fty-nine seconds. The company gave\neveryone on the assembly line a bell to ring, and as soon as an employee found a\nproblem, he or she would ring the bell and a supervisor would hurry over to\nresolve the problem.\nThat is the major reason Toyota came to dominate its industry. It wasn’t that\nit had better marketing or better prices. It was that it learned how to compress\ntime frames. It could execute faster than its competitors.\nLook at the fast-food industry. Why has McDonald’s dominated for years?\nNot because it has better food or service. It’s because it is faster at delivering your\nfood. Follow its example. Create a committee of savvy people and task them with\n\u0000guring out how to make a function faster. Take a sheet of paper and list the steps\nof any function in your business. Examine how you can eliminate one of the\nsteps. Assess which steps you can shorten. Then beta test your revised steps. Make\nadjustments based on the test. Implement every tool you can to compress time\nframes.\nFour Ways to Accelerate\nIncreasing the speed of the following four factors will enable your business to\nmove faster.\n1. Functioning speed. This is the support system you provide to your team. Examine who your\npeople are and their capabilities. Can you help them improve through training and other means\nso they might cut some time from a function? Do you need to bring in someone who has the\ntalent to speed things up? Your functioning speed is the core of your business.\n\f\n2. Processing speed. There are a number of functions or processes that make your organization\ngo. How quickly do you get your product from A to Z? Earlier, I suggested that you break down\nthe steps of a given function and analyze each one of them with speed in mind. Let’s say you\nhave an online store. The factors contributing to the processing speed of making a sale are as\nfollows: customer \u0000nds site through search; visits site; clicks on the page with speci\u0000c types of\nproducts; examines prices and other options; adds product to cart; enters credit card\ninformation; chooses type of shipping; con\u0000rms purchase. The odds are that you can reduce the\ntime it takes customers to perform at least one of these steps. You don’t think so? Ever heard of\n“one-click” ordering on Amazon? Amazon has come to dominate e-commerce by focusing on\nprocessing speed.\n3. Expansion speed. This is about how quickly you move into new markets, make acquisitions,\nand introduce new products. What’s the average time it takes you to enter a new market if\nyou’re a retailer? Again, identify your time frame and dissect your steps. If you’re expanding\ninto an overseas market, is there one particular step that always slows you down? You have to\nidentify bottlenecks and \u0000nd ways to plow through them. If you’re negotiating deals overseas\nthat are constantly blocked by bureaucracy, determine how much they’re costing you in terms\nof time, aggravation, and money. The simple solution may be hiring a well-connected attorney\nwith global experience and the right connections.\n4. Timing speed. The question “When?” can work magic. Time your moves correctly, and you\ncan beat competitors who have more resources than you do. You know the government is set to\nrelease a major study on how a certain vitamin has been found to be e\u0000ective in moderating the\ne\u0000ects of a certain disease. You don’t know which vitamin it’s going to recommend, but you bet\nthat the high-potency vitamin you’ve been developing is it. You time your product introduction\nfor the day that the government announces the results of its study.\nTiming can involve a variety of actions: when to announce an initiative; when\nto launch an attack against a competitor; when to \u0000re or hire; when to give people\na bonus; when to o\u0000er equity. If you get the timing right, you will double your\nimpact. There’s a saying that speed kills. That’s right; it kills the competition.\nA Seven-Step System to Compress Time Frames\n1. Choose a process. From buying a house to ordering a cab to sharing pictures online with\nyour friends, there is a process to follow. In fact, one of the great ways to identify a potential\nbusiness is to \u0000nd a \u0000awed process that you can improve upon.\n2. List the steps of the process.\n3. Remove a step. This is where the magic happens. See if you can remove a step. How would\nthe process function without that step? This is where disruption is born. If you’re not\nconvinced, turn back a few pages and see why my company spent more than $2 million to\naccelerate its processing speed.\n4. Minimize the steps. Take the remaining steps and condense their time frame. Condensing\nthe remaining steps will help streamline the process, which is now missing one of the original\nsteps.\n\f\n5. Beta test the new process. Find a subset of customers to test and see how the new process\nfunctions. How does the market respond to it, and where do improvements need to be made?\n6. Adapt the process. Based on the results of your beta test, adjust your process. This is where\nyou adapt the process to \u0000t a speci\u0000c need.\n7. Reﬁne. You’ve beta tested, and the adjusted process is ready to be unleashed. Sell your product\nfaster to all corners of your market, and don’t forget to repeat these steps again and again to\ncreate exponential growth.\nPlan (Optimistically and Wisely) for Growth\nSteve Jobs said, “There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. ‘I skate to where\nthe puck is going to be, not to where it has been.’ And we’ve always tried to do\nthat at Apple.” Though this quote has become so overused that it now seems\ncliché, there is plenty of wisdom in it. Gretzky was the ultimate grand master of\nhockey. His ability to see more moves ahead than his opponents did is the reason\nhe’s still called “The Great One.”\nYou’re constantly going to be forced to make decisions while living in the\npresent time, just as your mind and heart live in a future truth. Let’s take your\no\u0000ce space as an example. If your company is successful, it’s going to grow. If it’s\nextremely successful, its growth trajectory will be steep. That means you will need\nmore people, equipment, and space. When the tech hub Built in Chicago\nannounced in September 2019 that VillageMD, a primary care–led medical\ncompany, had raised $100 million in Series B funding, its press release said, “The\ncompany has raised a total of $216 million to date… and has outgrown four\nheadquarters since its launch in 2013.”\nRapid growth can cause chaos, but you can control the chaos to some extent\nby following this simple rule: If you have the capital, lease o\u0000ce space based on\nwhat you’ll need eighteen months from now. For many companies, if is a rather\nimportant word. With four moves in six years, the rapidly growing company\nVillageMD seems to have found the right balance.\nIf your company grows fast and doesn’t have enough space, you’ll have people\non top of people. When your employees are in too close proximity, some will rub\nothers the wrong way. People will start arguing more often and more loudly.\nThey’ll start bickering over who gets to use the conference room. They’ll be"

    "raw_text": "telling each other to stop listening to their phone conversations. There’s no\nquestion that not having adequate space can slow your momentum.\nRomeo raised $750,000 to start a \u0000nancial marketing \u0000rm in Long Beach,\nCalifornia. Like a lot of entrepreneurs, Romeo was a terri\u0000c salesperson. A\ncharismatic closer, he was brilliant at getting people, to quote Alec Baldwin’s\ncharacter in Glengarry Glen Ross, “to sign on the line which is dotted.” Even the\nbest salespeople, however, can be terrible businesspeople.\nI went to Long Beach’s World Trade Center to see Romeo’s operation. He\nhad leased the entire nineteenth \u0000oor of the building, nearly 30,000 square feet.\nAt $30 a square foot per year, the monthly rent alone came to $75,000. That was\nbefore taking into consideration phones, internet, electricity, or any of the other\nongoing expenses of running an o\u0000ce—let alone the support sta\u0000. It was\napparent that Romeo wasn’t thinking more than one or two moves ahead.\nRomeo’s investor asked me if I thought he’d made a good investment.\n“How soon do you expect to see a return on your investment?” I asked.\n“Nothing unreasonable,” he said. “The next six months would be \u0000ne. Hell,\neven twelve.”\nI started processing, and it was obvious that the business was headed for a cli\u0000.\nDo the math: the \u0000rm would need to gross $100,000 a month just to cover its\no\u0000ce expenses, plus another $62,500 a month over the \u0000rst year to pay back the\ninvestor. Not to mention personal expenses such as food, clothes, and cars for\nRomeo, who had expensive taste.\nI had dinner with Romeo before leaving. He asked for honest feedback, so I\ntold him to minimize his expenses immediately while he still had the chance. I\nexplained that it made no sense to get an o\u0000ce that big for only \u0000ve full-time\nagents and thirty part-time agents. With forty empty desks in the o\u0000ces and\ncubicles, the place looked like a morgue. As you might expect, he wasn’t very\nhappy with my advice.\nRomeo had the talent and skills to make the business work. He just wasn’t\nwilling to accept that running a successful business requires sound \u0000nancial\ndecision making. He ended up digging his way into deep debt and had to shut\n\f\ndown the business. Do you think Romeo was acting like a grand master? Had he\nthought even three moves ahead, he could have avoided that catastrophic course.\nI understand that managing for both the present and the future is a delicate\nbalance. If you have \u0000ve full-time employees, your sweet spot may be an o\u0000ce\nthat can accommodate \u0000fteen or twenty. If you’re savvy, you will work out an\noption on adjacent space that you can move into when you need it.\nYes, plan for growth. And, yes, plan wisely so you can allocate capital for its\nmost important use. People can talk themselves into anything. Before going crazy\non o\u0000ce space, let’s play a little game. See if you can match the company with its\nbirthplace.\nYou probably already know about Apple. For the remaining ones, match the\ncompany to its \u0000rst o\u0000ce.\nAnswers: Mattel: Own garage; Google: Rented garage; Disney: Uncle’s garage; eBay: Home oﬃce; Harley-\nDavidson: Cramped woodshed behind a friend’s machine shop; Dell: Dorm room\nRegret Minimization\nJe\u0000 Bezos, the founder of Amazon, talks a lot about regret minimization—about\nprojecting himself forward in time and then thinking about what, theoretically,\nhe might regret not having done. For Bezos, this is a way to make sure he takes\ncalculated risks, since even if he fails, it can’t be worse than not having tried at all."

    "raw_text": "Turns out that Wayne Gretzky, the leading scorer in NHL history, said one\nmore timeless thing: “You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don’t take.”\nHere’s a question that will make this concept clear: at age eighty-nine, Warren\nBu\u0000ett is worth $90 billion (as of January 2020). What do you think he was\nworth at age forty-seven? Five billion dollars? Twenty billion dollars? If you’re\nlike most people, you’d \u0000gure it would be at least that much. After all, even\nthough we’re talking about a forty-two-year gap, it makes sense that he’d have to\nhave had a lot of money back then to get to $90 billion today.\nAt age forty-seven, Bu\u0000ett was worth $67 million.\nHow is that possible? He had a lot of catching up to do in order to make the\nleap from $67 million to $90 billion, right? So how did he do it?\nBu\u0000ett did it because he didn’t have bad habits and he minimized his regrets.\nNow, I don’t know Mr. Bu\u0000ett. Maybe he had other regrets that we don’t know\nabout. But I do know from all that I’ve read about him that he’s maintained a\nconsistent record of being a decent, fair-minded person in both his personal and\nprofessional lives.\nBu\u0000ett isn’t a drug addict, he doesn’t cheat his partners, he doesn’t gamble\naway his money, he doesn’t get into legal trouble. On the public record, there’s no\nindication of anything like this. Bu\u0000ett seems to have minimized his regrets and\nthus maintained his momentum. That’s a big part of what helped him go from\n$67 million to $90 billion in forty-two years.\nContrast Bu\u0000ett’s path to the path taken by the late talk show host Morton\nDowney, Jr.\nIn the late 1980s, Downey’s syndicated show was bigger than Phil Donahue’s.\nIt was reality TV before reality TV existed, and Downey was on top of the world.\nUntil he self-destructed.\nAllegedly, on April 24, 1989, Downey was in an airport bathroom when he\nwas attacked by three white supremacists. They beat him up, cut his hair, and\ndrew swastikas on his face using a marker. The police administered a lie detector\ntest, which he passed.\nShortly thereafter, Downey admitted that he had made up the entire incident.\nOn July 19, 1989, his show was canceled. In February 1990, Downey \u0000led for\nbankruptcy."

    "raw_text": "Now consider a second incident. On one show, Downey had a guest who was\na vegetarian talking about her healthy lifestyle. He responded to her by saying,\n“Let me tell you something, darling. I smoke four packs of cigarettes a day. I drink\nfour glasses of alcohol a day. I eat red meat. I’m \u0000fty-\u0000ve years old, and I look as\ngood as you do.”\nDowney died at age sixty-eight of lung cancer after having long since faded\nfrom public view. If he were able to look back, do you think he might regret some\nof his behaviors?\nHe had everything going for him, but he couldn’t sustain momentum. Let\nhim be a cautionary tale for you about what you don’t want to regret.\nVice Management\nFew people are saints, and many entrepreneurs have vices, but if they can learn to\nmanage them, they can prevent them from derailing their careers. I learned from\nPastor Dudley Rutherford that there are four G’s that can destroy a\nbusiness/person.\nThe Four Hazardous G’s\n1. Greed\n2. Gluttony\n3. Girls/guys\n4. Gambling\nTemptation gets the best of many of us. How many people have destroyed\ntheir careers and their lives because of gambling? But it doesn’t have to be a\ncommon vice such as gambling, drinking, or drugs. Some people have vices\nattached to money: they are either miserly or they spend like drunken sailors. As a\nresult, they either fail to make the right investments (in technology, people, etc.)\nor they spend foolishly and can’t sustain their operations.\nSome people’s vice is arrogance: everything is about them. They fail to give\nother people credit and hog both the spotlight and the money from the business.\nSooner rather than later, those around them \u0000gure it out, and the top talent\nleaves.\n\f\nCheating is also a vice, and it’s one to which some entrepreneurs are\nparticularly vulnerable. Early in my career, I was competing for customers with\nLarry, and he was kicking my ass, producing three times as much business as I\nwas. It was humiliating for more reasons than one; I had a hypercompetitive\ngirlfriend at the time who was also in our business, and she, too, was losing to\nhim. It drove her crazy.\nTo calm her down, I said, “Listen, let me put it to you this way: This is a long-\nterm game. Executing our strategy takes time. We’re going to keep doing it the\nway we’re doing it because this is a long-term play.”\nSix months later, the SEC charged Larry with convincing clients to take\nmoney out of their mortgages and invest it in variable annuities. He lost his\nsecurities license, as did nine other people in his agency who were copying his\ntactics.\nLarry was talented, but he allowed his vice to get the better of him. All the\nmomentum he built when he was selling like crazy was stopped—permanently.\nThe Five Deadly Sins of Entrepreneurs\nThe list of vices is endless, but entrepreneurs are especially vulnerable to certain\ntemptations. They are sins that you should do everything in your power to avoid,\nsince they will destroy whatever momentum you’ve generated for your business.\nHere are the deadly \u0000ve:\n1. Being too cheap or splurging unwisely\n2. Letting the wrong people have in\u0000uence over you\n3. Having a “royalty” mentality\n4. Refusing to adapt\n5. Obsessively comparing yourself to others\n1. BEING TOO CHEAP OR SPLURGING UNWISELY\nIf you’re a sports fan, you’ve probably witnessed a football coach who plays\nconservatively when his team has a lead. Without the aggressive play calling that\nhelped build the lead, the other team has an opportunity to mount a comeback.\nThe coach thinks he’s being wise and protecting the lead. In reality, his extreme\n\f\ncaution makes everyone afraid of making a mistake and allows the other team to\ngain ground. The “prevent defense” ends up costing them victory.\nWhen entrepreneurs are cheap, they convince themselves that they’re being\nfrugal; that they’ve made a good deal of money (i.e., built a big lead) and need to\nsit on it. Remember the old saying: You’ve got to spend money to make money.\nFail to spend money to update your software or launch a necessary new product,\nand you’ll pay.\nOther entrepreneurs kill their momentum by spending as though they possess\na bottomless well of cash. They are convinced that they, unlike everyone else, will\nnever have a down period. They spend too much too fast, often on the wrong\nthings, and when they need the money for something crucial, it’s not there. Poof,\nthere goes their momentum.\n2. LETTING THE WRONG PEOPLE HAVE INFLUENCE OVERYOU\nYour consultant tells you to double the size of your business. Your spouse insists\nthat you have to cut your sta\u0000 by 50 percent. Your buddy suggests that you merge\nyour company with his. None of this advice is necessarily bad, but you need to\nanalyze the source. Decide who is the wrong person to follow and who is the\nright one. The wrong person has his or her own agenda. The wrong person is\nmore interested in gaining your favor by being a yes-man than o\u0000ering objective\nadvice. The wrong person is jealous of your success and secretly wants to see you\nfail. The wrong person may also be a loved one who doesn’t have access to all the\nintel and data that you have access to.\nProcess these issues. Don’t let people sway you without \u0000rst analyzing who\nthey are, their character, and their motivations. Remember, too, that just because\nthey’ve been with you for a long time—as a colleague, a friend, or even a spouse—\nit doesn’t mean that their suggestions are sound.\n3. HAVING A “ROYALTY” MENTALITY\nYou feel entitled, invincible, and infallible. Like a king or queen, you rule and\nexpect your subjects to obey rather than challenge your every proclamation. No\n\f\ndoubt you’ve been successful and feel as though you rule your empire. But stop\nand think for a moment about what your entitled attitude is doing:\nNo one questions your decisions.\nNo one ventures an opinion di\u0000erent from your own.\nNo one is willing to take a risk (for fear of having his or her proverbial head chopped o\u0000).\nLeaders who act like royalty lose their thrones. If the peasants don’t revolt, a\nnew leader who doesn’t have this mentality will take the territory.\n4. REFUSING TO ADAPT\nAgility is prized in organizations today for a reason. In chapter 12, we’ll discuss\nhow quickly companies fall out of the Fortune 500 and the S&P 500. If you can’t\nadapt, you’re going to fail quickly. “Pivot” is a useful buzzword; it means the\nability to turn quickly as situations shift.\nToo many entrepreneurs are convinced that they have to stay the course, that\nthey have to double down on a strategy that isn’t working. Just because Strategy\nA worked and helped your business prosper last year, that doesn’t mean it’s viable\nthis year.\n5. OBSESSIVELY COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHERS\nYou can lose sight of the bigger picture if you’re constantly envious of a\ncompetitor. I’m a highly competitive guy, and if someone in my industry is doing\nbetter than I am, my re\u0000ex is to \u0000nd a way to beat him. There’s nothing wrong\nwith that. What’s wrong is when you obsess about someone else—a competitor,\nyour brother-in-law, your mentor—and don’t focus on your strategy and\nobjectives. All you want to do is beat the object of your envy, and if that’s all you\ncare about, you’re caring about the wrong thing and your business will lose its\nway. Grand masters possess the incredible ability to focus. They know that if they\nallow any distraction to seep into their consciousness, they will quickly lose their\nedge."

    "raw_text": "The Downside of Speed: Fast Money\nTemptations\nAre you hell-bent on growing your company? Most entrepreneurs are. They’re\nambitious and map out a strategy that will help them add new products and\nservices, increase their revenues, expand their territory, and grow in other ways.\nYou’re going to be tempted to take shortcuts. Trust me. You’re going to be\no\u0000ered ways to make quick money or shortcuts to growth. You may be tempted\nto partner with someone who has a reputation for being unethical but also has\ncritical contacts. You may try to o\u0000er a “gift” to a government o\u0000cial or someone\nelse with the clout to overlook a violation or help your proposal go to the front of\nthe line. You may get into a lucrative business where you see the bene\u0000t of\nviolating your moral code.\nI’m not saying that you’re going to do anything illegal. But you may violate\nyour values and principles for the sake of growth. There are repercussions for\ndoing so.\nWhen my agency started to grow, I received calls from guys who were doing a\nlot of insurance business with us who were asking for side deals. You have no idea\nhow tempted I was to say yes. I wasn’t greedy for money; I was greedy for\nmomentum. If a guy o\u0000ers me a “side deal” that pays $200,000, it’s easy to\nrationalize accepting that money so I can use it to hire more leaders or spend\nmore on our next innovative campaign.\nThose types of deals will tempt you, but you have to see \u0000ve moves ahead to\nunderstand that the poison they contain is enough to destroy your business. If I\nhad ever made that kind of side deal and my loyal guys had found out about it, it\nwould have been game over.\nNever cross your loyal guys. If they \u0000nd out that you have made questionable\ndeals, two things will happen. First, they will say, “Hey, I want a side deal, too.”\nObviously, you can’t give everyone one of these deals. And second, when you\neventually have a falling-out with one of the side-deal guys, he will tell everyone\nabout it. He may tell you, “Just give me that contract, I won’t tell anyone.” But he\nwill when he’s mad at you, and then everyone will know the games you’ve been\nplaying.\n\f\nMaintaining your integrity is always a winning strategy. What happens when\nyou compromise your integrity is that you chase little pockets of growth at the\nexpense of much bigger growth targets. You opt for little scores instead of big,\nsustainable ones. It’s the perfect formula for building a mediocre business and\nbeing paralyzed by paranoia. You’re better than that.\nMass × Velocity = Momentum\nWhen your business gathers the force of a boulder rolling downhill, it is going to\nbe dangerous. The key is managing its speed. Build on the momentum, and your\ncompetitors will be in trouble. Get ahead of yourself, and your creditors will be.\nChaos is to entrepreneurship as dangerous waves are to sur\u0000ng. It comes with\nthe territory, and if you don’t know how to handle it e\u0000ectively, you’re in trouble.\nYou can process information e\u0000ectively even when your world is topsy-turvy.\nMore than that, you can draw energy from the chaos and use it to redouble your\ne\u0000orts to manage your business. In fact, I deliberately put the Move about\nsystems right after this one. If you’re feeling nervous about speed, having the\nsystems to track it and manage it is the perfect antidote."

    "raw_text": "11\nMoneyball: Designing Systems to\nTrack Your Business\nIt is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\n—Sherlock Holmes\nIn business you should be constantly asking yourself: What can I track?\nEntrepreneurs love the expression “Move the needle.” But you must \u0000rst\n\u0000gure out what the needle is measuring!\nIf you don’t have measurable numbers you look at \u0000rst thing in the morning\nwhen you wake up, you’re managing ine\u0000ciently. Leaders who are hands on in\nevery aspect of their business have yet to learn the bene\u0000ts of data. Creating\nsystems and protocols limits the need for you to micromanage. Once you learn\nto track the key indicators of your business, you will know exactly where to\ndirect your energy and expertise.\nA CEO is responsible for getting things done, and in the old days, that may\nhave involved a lot of management by walking around and creating\nimplementation systems. Today, everything depends on data. CEOs often\npossess strong personalities with distinctive talents. Some of us are brash and\nbold and use our aggressiveness to get deals done. Some of us are clever and\ncreative and rely heavily on our innovative ideas to sustain our business. As a\nresult, we tend to lean more heavily on our personality than on systems.\n\f\nIf you’re not that ambitious, maybe this approach is \u0000ne. But if you want to\nbuild something big and sustainable, you also have to rely on systems.\nI’m a big believer in systems: systems of data; systems of procedures; systems\nof processes. Systems help you with follow-through and follow-up, and they also\nhelp create a culture in which nothing is ever unclear. When you’re trying to\nmove to the next level of business growth and you’re not sure which option is\nbest, data on di\u0000erent markets can help you make the right choice. When you’re\ntrying to \u0000gure out how to solve a challenging customer service problem, data\ncan help you implement a system that has made other customers happy.\nKnowing how to study data and using it to track your business is a game\nchanger for any CEO. Being a great salesperson or a charismatic networker\nmight make you the life of the party, but at a certain point, you’re going to need\nmore than your wonderful personality to make your business boom.\nData-Driven Execution\nAs a teenager, I used to buy the Los Angeles Daily News and devour the sports\nsection. Reading English frustrated me back then, but I could not get enough of\nnumbers. For hours and hours, I pored over box scores like a mad scientist. Of\nall the sports, on paper at least, baseball presented the most perplexing puzzle.\nWhen I read Michael Lewis’s Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair\nGame in 2011, it dawned on me that what I had learned from all those years of\nstudying box scores could be applied to my business. Though I had always been\na strong salesman and had developed into a solid sales manager, adding analytics\nto my toolbox catapulted me to becoming a bona \u0000de CEO who could scale my\nbusiness.\nMoneyball tells the story of how Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt in the\nmovie of the same name), the general manager of the Oakland A’s, applied\npredictive analytics to baseball. Among his epiphanies was discovering that on-\nbase percentage was a more important factor in winning than batting average, a\nstatistic that had always been revered by players, managers, and sportswriters. In\nretrospect it seems so obvious, but for decades, on-base percentage was an\nundervalued metric. In Little League, coaches say, “A walk is as good as a hit.”\n\f\nEven so, the best and the brightest in the game of baseball were analyzing the\nwrong data simply because that was the way it had always been done.\nIt is our duty as entrepreneurs to disrupt conventional thinking by\nconsidering how our next moves can transform our industry. Just as I was\ninspired by Billy Beane (whom I interviewed in 2019), I want you to apply\nanalytics to your own business. What is your equivalent of on-base percentage?\nAre you putting too much weight on revenue and not enough on margin? Does\nyour compensation structure incentivize opening new accounts at the expense of\nselling more to existing accounts?\nAs you’re about to see, reading all those box scores created the foundation for\nme to make my biggest leap in scaling my business.\nUse Data and Logic (or Make a Key Hire) to\nPredict the Future\nThe best entrepreneurs are constantly looking at least \u0000ve moves ahead. As\nfocused as they are on the here and now, they must also project what might\nhappen in the future. They need to prepare to pivot, matching the velocity of\nwhatever change is sweeping toward them.\nDo you see a new competitor on the horizon? If so, what moves can you\nmake now to counteract that competitor? Do you believe your industry is on the\nverge of fragmentation, of turning into multiple niches? If so, what strategy\nimplemented today will help you dominate your niche next year and in the years\nto come?\nWhen you prepare for a likely future, your competitors who have not done so\nwill be rattled while you steal their market share. You’ll handle trends and other\nchanges calmly while other companies’ leaders are \u0000ustered.\nNo one can see the future, but you can make logical deductions about trends\nif you gather the data and project scenarios. Another Michael Lewis book, The\nBig Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, illustrates this concept beautifully. It\ntells the true story of Michael Burry (played in the movie of the same title by\nChristian Bale), a hedge fund manager who predicted in 2005 that the housing\nbubble would be the catalyst that would make the entire banking industry\n\f\ncollapse. According to Burry, the evidence of the coming crisis was there for\nanyone to see if he was willing to look, but Burry’s peers were too busy raking in\nmoney to worry about their next moves. For a while, at least, it was the amateurs\nwho appeared to be the smart ones, because they were doing well in the short\nterm. Meanwhile, Burry, the grand master, plotted his future moves, seeing the\nlarger picture of the chessboard and predicting where the market was ultimately\ngoing.\nBurry went to all the major banks, including Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank,\nand Merrill Lynch, and convinced them to create a new \u0000nancial product that\nwould allow him to bet against the industry. Both Burry’s team and the fund’s\ninvestors thought he was nuts—after all, it didn’t appear that anyone else in the\nindustry was worried about the collapse of the housing bubble. But because\nBurry had already proven himself so good at seeing the future, his investors had\ngiven him the authority to make bold moves.\nHe bought hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of “credit default swaps.”\nWhen his initial move appeared to be working against him, his investors almost\nrevolted. Burry, undeterred, held his positions. When the subprime mortgage\nmarket crashed, those swaps brought returns exceeding 500 percent.\nEvery investor had access to the same data as Michael Burry did, but they\nwere all too busy acting in the moment to think about what the next few years\nmight bring. Because Burry was diligent enough to dissect the data and had the\nforesight of a grand master, he was able to pro\u0000t from predicting the future. In\nyour business, it may take this degree of planning and patience to launch an\ninnovative campaign.\nI understand that you may not have either the time or the mathematical mind\nof Michael Burry. This leads me to my next point. I’ve been asked countless\ntimes over the years, “What’s the best investment I can make to scale my\nbusiness?” My answer to that question has changed as I’ve evolved. Now my\nanswer to this question is always the same: “Spend six \u0000gures and hire a\npredictive analytics expert.”\nIf you have seen Moneyball, you may remember that Paul DePodesta (played\nby Jonah Hill in the \u0000lm, and now the chief strategy o\u0000cer for the NFL’s\nCleveland Browns) became Billy Beane’s secret weapon. He was the numbers"

    "raw_text": "guy who not only devoured statistical data but also analyzed it with a new frame\nof thinking. DePodesta was the nerd in the front o\u0000ce, the guy with the\neconomics degree from Harvard. Beane never developed DePodesta’s predictive\nanalytics skills. Because he hired him, he didn’t have to.\nGo \u0000nd your DePodesta. A critical skill of successful entrepreneurs is hiring\npeople smarter than they are who can make up for their weaknesses. The way the\ngame is played now, predictive analytics is an area in which you’d better excel.\nTo Scale, Codify Your Knowledge So It’s\nTransferable\nImagine asking Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, or Pablo Picasso to teach you\nhow to paint. They would struggle to explain their methodology, and even if\nthey could, good luck trying to implement it. The gift of an artist—or any other\ngenius—is not transferable. How about that of an entrepreneur, leader, or\ncoach?\nWe’ve talked about how the brilliance of Bill Belichick has led to six Super\nBowl victories. Thinking that Belichick’s genius must be transferable, several\nNFL teams have hired his assistants as head coaches. Their logic is simple: Who\nbetter than coaches who have observed Belichick’s genius up close to lead teams\nof their own? Great idea—except, as has been evidenced by the failures of\nRomeo Crennel, Eric Mangini, and Josh McDaniels as head coaches, it hasn’t\nworked.\nNFL owners so desperately want that Belichick secret sauce that they\ncontinue to hire disciples such as Matt Patricia. In Patricia’s \u0000rst two seasons as\nhead coach of the Detroit Lions, the team won only nine out of thirty-two\ngames. Maybe what this is telling us is that the skill of a Super Bowl–winning\ncoach is not transferable. (Belichick’s disciples Mike Vrabel, Bill O’Brien, and\nBrian Flores, however, have shown promise and may reverse this trend.)\nNow let’s look at Bill Walsh. Walsh led the San Francisco 49ers from 2–14 in\n1979 to Super Bowl champions three years later (the \u0000rst of Walsh’s three Super\nBowl victories). He had seven assistants on his \u0000rst sta\u0000 who became head\ncoaches, including Super Bowl winners George Seifert and Mike Holmgren.\n\f\nHolmgren, in turn, had \u0000ve assistants who became head coaches. In 2007,\nnineteen years after Walsh retired from the 49ers, fourteen of the NFL’s thirty-\ntwo head coaches were either direct descendants or second- or third-generation\ndisciples of Walsh.\nWhat’s the main di\u0000erence between Belichick and Walsh? Belichick is known\nfor secrecy, and Walsh is known for his lists. Yes, lists. The reason that Walsh’s\ngenius could be transferred to others is that he codi\u0000ed and shared his\nknowledge.\nSome may think that Bill Belichick is even more of a genius for making it\nhard for his assistants to beat him after they’ve left. Why in the world would he\nwant to make it easy for his assistants to learn how to beat him? He would gain\nnothing by making his knowledge available. You, on the other hand, have\neverything to gain by making yours available. You simply cannot scale your\nbusiness without creating the systems for it to operate without you.\nYou have to make lists. You must create manuals (video libraries may be more\ne\u0000ective than printed ones). You must codify your knowledge. If it exists only in\nyour head, you have a job to do. If you want to have a sustainable business,\ncodify what you know and make sure it gets transferred to everyone else in your\norganization.\nMake Your Numbers Visible in Order to\nIdentify Leaks and Trends\nIf you walk through our o\u0000ces, you’ll see screens and data streams everywhere.\nBy displaying our data in the o\u0000ce, we are creating accountability and\nhighlighting radical transparency.\nBecause everyone sees everything, it’s an amazing way of using the carrot and\nstick simultaneously—without having to say or do anything. Because the\nnumbers are in plain view, performers feel recognized just as nonperformers feel\nuncomfortable. If the latter feel too uncomfortable, all the better; they will either\nup their game to avoid further embarrassment or leave the company.\nTransparency is the ultimate performance-enhancing drug. And when it doesn’t\n\f\nwork to motivate your poor performers, they will weed themselves out—which\nis exactly what you want.\nYou may call this harsh. I call it e\u0000ective.\nLet’s go back to analytics. With all the data in front of me, I watch for two\nthings: leaks and trends. Leaks alert me to ine\u0000ciencies. If, for example, I see a\nbig spike in submitted policy applications but the processing time from our\nheadquarters to the insurance carrier decreases, I suspect a leak.\nThe numbers give me clues for where to look. Is the problem the number of\npeople processing the applications, the lack of the right people doing so, or the\nprocess itself? If I saw a decrease in processing time tomorrow, I would really be\nconcerned that there’s a problem. Right now I’m under the impression that we\nhave hired the right sta\u0000 and the investment in our technology is working. Why,\nthen, is processing time slower? Though the data won’t provide the answer, it\nwill alert me to the fact that there’s a problem that needs to be addressed.\nI also look at trends. Like a stock analyst, I look at line graphs to see how\nquickly things are moving. Why did we have a downswing in the \u0000rst three\nmonths of the year? Why did sales skyrocket in May? What are we doing right,\nand what shouldn’t we be doing? Digging down into the numbers helps us\ntweak our approach and make it more e\u0000ective.\nMost businesses have some degree of seasonality. Retailers depend on Black\nFriday, just as \u0000lm studios depend on holiday movies. It’s also why retailers have\ncreated arbitrary events such as back-to-school sales and why online retailers\ncreated Cyber Monday. The problem I often see is blind acceptance of these\ntrends. It’s long been considered a given in our industry that December to\nFebruary and June to August are slow months. When I started analyzing data, I\nsaw that 75 percent of policies were sold in six months of the year (March to\nMay and September to November). When I looked deeper, I saw that there\nwasn’t any good reason for this. It wasn’t as though we were running a ski slope\nthat depends on weather for tra\u0000c.\nWhat that told me was that the agents were mentally checking out in those\nmonths. In doing so, they were simply living up to preconceived expectations.\nBecause the industry as a whole, and their peers, slowed down at certain times,\n\f\nthey followed suit. And because my competitors accepted this as a given—and as\na result tolerated poor results during certain periods—I saw an opportunity.\nHow did I react to those bits of data?\nI ran innovative campaigns speci\u0000cally targeted to increase sales during the\nslow months. I also changed the dates of our most prestigious incentive\nconference to make sales in the summer the most important component.\nI then took a page out of Ray Dalio’s book and created baseball cards with\nevery agent’s statistics for the year. Because the agents were aware that the cards\nwould be going to press on January 15—and their performance would be seen\nby everyone in the company—sales in December skyrocketed. Within two years\nof my uncovering and analyzing that data, our sales percentages shifted from\n75/25 (peak months/slow months) to 55/45. In other words, we eliminated\nalmost all the seasonality from our business. Data alone didn’t solve the\nproblem, but it did alert us to the problem and allowed us to track our progress\ntoward the solution.\nWith that win under our belt, I started examining the trends for each part of\na month. In doing so, I was able to see where we were weak and how to create\nincentives to avoid the end-of-the-month frenzy to close business. Since we\nstarted tracking this, the sales within each month have started to balance.\nAll CEOs should be looking at their numbers, watching for leaks and trends,\nand then driving their execution based on what they learn.\nTrust Numbers, Not People\nWhen you’re running a company, you can’t always trust other people to tell you\nthe truth. In fact, you can’t always trust yourself. Other people have their own\nagendas; they want to work on a particular project and are overly optimistic in\ntheir projections of its success. Sometimes they aren’t even conscious of how\nthey’re twisting the truth.\nEntrepreneurs can make the same mistakes. You convince yourself that you\ncan make a new product work, but it’s your ego talking, not your logic. Or you\npromote someone because you like him, not because he’s earned it.\nNumbers help keep everyone honest."

    "raw_text": "Most of your revenue producers have type A personalities. They’re aggressive,\ncon\u0000dent, decisive types, and these qualities are useful in various aspects of\nbusiness. But type A’s are also good self-promoters, and as a CEO, you need to\ndi\u0000erentiate between self-promotion and achievement.\nHere’s how to do it. When people tell me how hard they’ve been working\nand all the results they’ve been generating, I start out by asking, “What’s your\nclosing ratio?”\nLet’s say I’m having this conversation with Paul. He responds, “Fifty\npercent.”\n“Awesome. Now let me ask, what’s your average sale per client?”\n“Two thousand dollars.”\n“So if you make ten proposals and close half of those, that translates into ten\nthousand dollars.”\n“That’s right.”\n“So let me ask you: How come your best month last quarter was only six\nthousand dollars?”\nYou think you already know the answer. What you may not know is that your\ntrump card is silence. This is not the time to turn into Alec Baldwin’s character\nin Glengarry Glen Ross and scream, “Put that co\u0000ee down! Co\u0000ee’s for closers\nonly…. ‘The leads are weak.’… You’re weak!”\nRather than stating an assumption or questioning Paul’s work ethic, remain\nsilent. Let him answer the question.\nAt some point, Paul starts talking. Sure enough, he gets angry and protests\nthat he’s not lazy.\n“Why are you getting upset?” I ask. “I’m just playing back the numbers you\ngave me.”\nPaul has already started to re\u0000ect. He’s protesting that he’s not lazy, because\nhe knows the data says otherwise. There’s no need to beat him up. Just stick\nwith the process.\nBad managers use qualitative data. They’ll analyze such a situation with\nwords rather than numbers. They’ll say the person is lazy, dishonest, or\n\f\nunmotivated. Those words don’t do anything to solve the problem. Data, on the\nother hand, points to solutions.\nBy relying on the data, you defuse the emotion from the situation. By\nfocusing on the numbers, you help the other person acknowledge realities. This\nnot only provides the impetus for improvement but preserves your relationship.\nSolving for X seems straightforward in this situation. The only variables in\nPaul’s income are number of proposals, closing ratio, and average sale per client.\nLet’s say the last variable is \u0000xed at $2,000. There are only two ways to make\nmore money: make more proposals or improve the closing ratio. When you dig\ninto the numbers, you see that Paul’s closing ratio actually is 50 percent. The\nproblem is that he submitted only six proposals.\nJust as we had to look into the numbers when performing ITR analysis, we\nhave to go deeper here. The data tells us that Paul isn’t making enough\nproposals. What determines the number of proposals is what gets him to the\nproposal stage: prospecting. The culprit is that he’s not generating enough leads.\nThat’s the X you need to solve for.\nHas his social media marketing dropped o\u0000? Has he dropped out of his\nnetworking groups? Has he stopped calling existing customers or making cold\ncalls? You were on the right track when you measured the number of his\nproposals and his closing percentage. Digging deeper, you see that your next\nmove is to revisit his prospecting strategy and \u0000nd a way to measure it. For some\nideas, let’s look at how a major company uses data to manage its sales force.\nAnalyzing Data Goes Beyond Solving for X\nLanier Worldwide (now a subsidiary of Ricoh USA), an o\u0000ce products\ncompany based in Atlanta, is well regarded for the quality of its sales training. Its\nmetrics for copier sales reps (when Greg Dinkin worked there in 1994) were\nsimple:\n20 cold calls per day\n2 product demonstrations (demos) per day\n10 percent closing average\n1 sale per week, $1,200 commission per sale\n\f\nTherefore $1,200 commission per week\nFor recent college graduates, you can see how appealing this pitch is. Sell just\none copier a week, and you’ll make sixty grand a year. Even better, you had to\nclose only 10 percent of your demos to meet your quota. It’s a formula that\nLanier \u0000gured out based on years of data. The hard part, of course, was that on\naverage you had to make a hundred cold calls a week to make one sale.\nLet’s pretend that Chris is exceptional and has a closing ratio of 50 percent.\nWhen you look at his weekly numbers, you see that he is averaging $2,400 per\nweek. He’s absolutely killing it. He’s the number one rep in the o\u0000ce. What a\nstud.\nDo you see the problem?\nWe have to revert back to qualitative data. Being a “stud” doesn’t tell us\nanything.\nWhen we dig into the numbers and see that Chris closes at 50 percent, we\nstart scratching our heads. It’s time to solve for X. His monthly numbers look\nlike this:\nX cold calls per day\nX demos per day\n50 percent closing average\n2 sales per week, $1,200 commission per sale\nTherefore $2,400 commission per week\nFiguring out the number of demos is easy. Since he closes half of them, it’s\nobvious that he does four demos. But how about the cold-call numbers? They’re\nnowhere to be found.\nBy the way, doesn’t this story remind you of the story I just told you about\nPaul? The reason is that I want you to spot a trend. It is common for your most\ntalented employees to skate by on talent alone. It’s human nature that when\nthings come to us easily, we tend to coast. As a leader, it’s your job to challenge\nyour most talented people to live up to their talent. Unless you understand the\nnumbers, people such as Chris and Paul are going to earn a nice living. And\ncompletely underachieve! But they shouldn’t—not on Jobs’s watch, not on\nBelichick’s watch, and hopefully not on your watch.\n\f\nTo see what happened with Chris, let’s examine the math. If he had been\ndoing ten demos a week, he’d have been making \u0000ve sales instead of two. That\nwould have been $6,000 a week instead of $2,400. Because he was top dog in the\no\u0000ce and his boss didn’t have a Moneyball mentality, no one bothered to track\nhis activity. As a result, Chris stopped prospecting. When you dig deeper, you\nsee that he did zero cold calls. The demos all came from referrals or existing\nclients.\nThe simple answer? Make Chris do more cold calls.\nYou should have known that that was a trick question. There are no simple\nanswers in business. The data led us to \u0000gure out the reason Chris is\nunderachieving: a lack of prospects. Data alone, however, isn’t what\ndi\u0000erentiates the Billy Beanes and Paul DePodestas of the world from other\npeople. It’s data combined with analysis. If Chris is that good a closer, my \u0000rst\ninclination would be to \u0000nd him more prospects. Especially if I had people in\nthe \u0000rm who were great at prospecting and bad at closing, I’d \u0000nd a way to\ncombine their talents.\nBefore I did that, I would ask Chris (you guessed it), “Who do you want to\nbe?”\nGreat leaders \u0000nd the intersection of data and human nature. Like a smart\ndoctor who runs blood tests, they use the data to diagnose problems. They then\nuse their expertise to \u0000nd solutions.\nFor some entrepreneurs, data is the boring part of the business; they aren’t\ninterested in the numbers. But I hope these stories make you see why I am\nobsessed with data, especially when I can use it to gain a competitive advantage.\nAs I’ve said many times, reading about how to solve a problem can do only so\nmuch. You need to put this information to use in your own business. I gave you\na simple formula for tracking sales success. If you’re in the trucking business,\nyour formulas are going to be much di\u0000erent. Before turning the page, come up\nwith three formulas that will allow you to track your business. Ideally, these will\nbecome the \u0000rst numbers you look at before you start each business day.\nIf You Don’t Have a System, You Have a\nLimited Chance for Exponential Growth\n\f\nYou can see by now that words are not su\u0000cient to tell you what’s really\nhappening in your business. Here are four phrases that people with no data or\nsystems use:\n“Roughly…”\n“I think we’re at…”\n“Around…”\n“I believe we did…”\nCompanies that scale and grow eventually create an e\u0000ective system. If you\nbelieve you are going to grow your business on mere personality, your business\nwill be unpredictable. You need to create systems and protocols that will decrease\nthe need for you to micromanage.\nFive Reasons to Implement Systems\n1. What is measured can be scaled and improved.\n2. You will know where and to whom to direct your energy and expertise.\n3. You can stop micromanaging and empower your employees.\n4. Your employees, especially your top performers, won’t be able to deceive you with hype.\n5. You will simultaneously become more e\u0000ective and have more freedom.\nIt’s one thing to talk about creating systems; it’s another to execute them.\nWhen you’re sales focused, it’s hard to step away from revenue-producing\nactivities. Things such as creating manuals and systems did not come easily to\nme, and they likely will be hard for you. It’s also easier to cash checks than to\nwrite them. Both the technology and the people you need to hire won’t be\ncheap. And if you want to be a one-person shop and not grow, you don’t have to\ninvest in systems.\nHow to Increase the Value of Your Business\nWhen you’re in the middle of running a business, slowing down and building\nsystems is easier said than done. If you come from a sales background, you likely\nhave a “get the deal now and worry later” mentality. If you want to remain a"

If, however, you are interested in creating value\nrather than just pro\u0000t, you need to slow down long enough to create systems.\nA business that runs on systems, rather than just your know-how, increases in\nvalue. You have to document how the system \u0000ows. When new employees come\nin, what steps do you take to integrate them? You need to document every step.\nThe same is true of everything else in your business, such as the steps to take\nafter someone buys a product, when you need to follow up on a sale, and so on.\nBusinesses built on systems and procedures grow in value because they have a life\nof their own without being dependent on a certain human being. Obviously,\nyour business needs a driver, but having systems in place will increase its value to\na whole new level.\nYou can’t just measure data; you also have to analyze it. As they say on Wall\nStreet, don’t \u0000ght the tape. When the numbers paint an unpretty picture, your\nego is going to get involved. You’re going to start looking for ways to rationalize\nyour dips. Anticipate this happening, and you can avoid it.

I can\nalso say from experience that it’s going to feel tedious and painful—especially if\nyou see yourself as a visionary or you are a salesperson who lacks the patience to\ndo work that doesn’t produce an immediate return. I fought it for a long time.\nAnd whether it was from reading Moneyball or su\u0000ering from panic attacks, I\n\u0000nally learned that the only way to run a business with scale is to implement\nsystems that track data."

    "raw_text": "12\nStay Paranoid; The Grand Master\nNever Lets His Guard Down\nI attribute Intel’s ability to sustain success to being constantly on the alert for threats,\neither technological or competitive in nature. The word “paranoia” is meant to\nsuggest that attitude, an attitude that constantly looks over the horizon for threats to\nyour success.\n—Andy Grove, former CEO and chairman, Intel\nBusiness is war. Or, to put it another way, for a business, peace never exists. You\ncan be the market leader, you can be making record pro\u0000ts, you can believe that\nyou can relax and ride the momentum, but… someone is always out there\npreparing to attack you. You can experience the illusion of peace when things are\ngoing well, but it’s just an illusion. If you let down your guard for a second, you\nmake yourself vulnerable to attack.\nHistory is one of our best teachers. We use the term “Fortune 500” so often\nthat we may have forgotten its origin. In 1955, Edgar P. Smith, an editor at\nFortune magazine, published a list of the \u0000ve hundred largest US corporations by\ntotal annual revenue. Today, the list includes both public companies and private\nones (if their revenues are publicly available). Of the original \u0000ve hundred, guess\nhow many are still on the list. Half? Two hundred? Even if only 20 percent made\nit, you’re still looking at one hundred.\nTry \u0000fty-two.\n\f\nYou think it’s easy to stay relevant? Boeing, Campbell Soup Company,\nColgate-Palmolive, Deere & Company, General Motors, IBM, Kellogg\nCompany, Procter & Gamble, and Whirlpool Corporation represent the\nminority of \u0000rms that were on the list in both 1955 and 2019. You think other\nbusinesses aren’t out to destroy their competition—especially their biggest\ncompetitors? Eighty-nine percent of the original Fortune 500 have either gone\nbankrupt or fallen o\u0000 the list (some have been acquired). Business is a\nbloodbath. The moment you think you’re on safe ground is the moment you\nbecome the most vulnerable.\nDepending on where you are in your business cycle, this next set of data is\neither going to excite you or frighten you. I found it on the website of the\nFoundation for Economic Education (FEE).\nAccording to a 2016 report by Innosight (“Corporate Longevity: Turbulence Ahead for Large\nOrganizations”), corporations in the S&P 500 Index in 1965 stayed in the index for an average of\n33 years. By 1990, average tenure in the S&P 500 had narrowed to 20 years and is now forecast to\nshrink to 14 years by 2026. At the current churn rate, about half of today’s S&P 500 ﬁrms\nwill be replaced over the next 10 years as “we enter a period of heightened volatility for\nleading companies across a range of industries, with the next ten years shaping up to be the most\npotentially turbulent in modern history.”\nTechnology and social media are great equalizers. As a result, it’s even harder\nto stay relevant. It’s also easier to knock o\u0000 the big boys. You can’t stay relevant\nby staying the same. Get complacent for one minute, and you’re going to be\ntoast.\nEvery Day Is Urgent: Stay Alert; Stay Alive\nA heightened sense of urgency is a trait that the most successful entrepreneurs\nshare. For them, every day is a battle, and they treat it as though it’s a matter of\nlife and death. It gives them that urgent energy that translates into a business\nedge. You don’t want to compete against one of those people. It’s not that\nthey’re smarter or more skilled; it’s that they will outwork you. They are\nobsessed with winning.\nIn The 33 Strategies of War, Robert Greene said:"

    "raw_text": "You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of\nengaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you’re only half involved in what you\ndo…. Cut your ties to the past; enter unknown territory where you must depend on your wits and\nenergy to see you through. Place yourself on “death ground,” where your back is against the wall\nand you have to \u0000ght like hell to get out alive.\nI’m not telling you to be crazy paranoid but be cautious paranoid. In the\nlatter condition, you’re alert for what can go wrong but you’re not obsessive\nabout it. You’re conscious of potential dangers and pitfalls, and you keep your\nantenna up for signs that things are going south.\nThink about a common scene in war movies: A squad goes into combat and\nwins a battle, captures a villain, and settles in for the night. They celebrate their\nvictory, partying with drink and the local women. They pass out, and then what\nhappens in the middle of the night? They get ambushed. They let their guard\ndown, and the enemy takes advantage of it.\nWhen I was in the army, we had a saying: “Stay alert; stay alive.”\nThe same holds true in business. You’ve got to be alert for what can go\nwrong. Don’t be naive and think all your people are loyal and hardworking and\nwill function perfectly well without supervision. Don’t think you’ve squashed\nall your competitors and no one can come up with a way to challenge your\nposition. Don’t trust that the innovation that paved your way to success will\ncontinue to pave your way into the future.\nGood generals are paranoid, and they respond to that paranoia by creating\none great strategy after another. If you can outstrategize the competition, you\ncan protect yourself from things that will go wrong. Don’t wing it. Don’t rely\non a strategy until it gets stale. Keep mapping out fresh plans based on changing\nconditions; anticipate trends, and have a strategy in place to capitalize on them.\nEvery general from Napoleon to Patton mastered this technique, and every\nbusiness leader needs to do so as well. Why are your numbers always o\u0000 in\nFebruary? Why is there always a mad scramble as deadlines approach? Why do a\nlot of your meetings degenerate into yelling and scapegoating? Why have you\nlost three major customers in the last six months? These are the types of\nquestions that ought to give you pause. Investigate the deepest cause. See if you\n\f\ncan identify the problem that is hidden beneath the surface of things. When\nparanoia leads to curiosity, which leads to solutions, it is serving its function.\nThe Better You Do, the More Vulnerable You\nAre\nSuccess will diminish paranoia. This may seem counterintuitive, but think about\nwhat happens when everything is going great. You’ve probably experienced this:\nYou had one win after another, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, you’re dead\nin the water. What happened?\nWhat happened was that you got complacent. What happened was that you\nstopped being the hungriest person in your industry. What happened was that\nyou felt you had graduated past the point of having to be paranoid.\nI’ll tell you what happened to Rick, a good friend who was a criminal defense\nlawyer in Los Angeles—not just any criminal defense lawyer but one of the best.\nHe ended up representing powerful and wealthy drug dealers in the 1970s and\n’80s, and they invited Rick to party with them. One line of cocaine led to\nanother, and pretty soon he was doing a lot of it. They introduced him to\nPlayboy playmates, and soon Rick was going out with not one of them but two\n—and at the same time! After a series of poor decisions and cocaine-related legal\ntransgressions, Rick was sentenced to twenty years in prison. He lost his law\nlicense, and when he \u0000nally got out of prison, he was earning around $3,000 a\nmonth selling ad specialty items such as pens and shirts.\nHe was in his late sixties when I asked him what kind of guy he had been in\nhigh school. He said, “I was a regular guy. I married my high school sweetheart.”\nAs we talked, it became clear that he had been overwhelmed by his success. As\nhis law career took o\u0000, people began treating him like the captain of the football\nteam and women threw themselves at him. He was a late-blooming golden boy,\nand the glamour of the drug scene beckoned. Rick couldn’t resist. Like many\nsuccessful people, he couldn’t imagine how anything could derail his career\n(remember Morton Downey, Jr.?). As a result, he wasn’t prepared for the success\nthat ultimately ruined him. I’m sad thinking about Rick, who died in 2019. He\n\f\nwas a good friend with a big heart who made one bad move (trying cocaine) that\nled to a series of moves that put both his life and career into checkmate.\nBrené Brown, a research professor and best-selling author, gave a TED Talk\ncalled “The Power of Vulnerability” that has been viewed online more than 46\nmillion times. She understands how peer pressure can get the best of us. She said,\n“Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves even\nwhen we risk disappointing others.” Loving ourselves often translates into\nsaying no. I wish Rick had been wise enough to heed that advice.\nYou might remember Robert Shapiro as the lawyer who helped defend O. J.\nSimpson. He was and remains a highly successful attorney who maintained his\nmomentum despite his success. He’s made the transition from criminal to civil\nlaw, and when I interviewed him, I asked him about his criminal defense work\nand whether he had ever been tempted by clients who could o\u0000er him drugs and\nbeautiful women.\nShapiro said, “I never established a relationship, a friendship, with my clients.\nI always kept them at a distance.”\nIn contrast to Rick, by setting up boundaries, Shapiro maintained his\nmomentum, even after achieving fame and success.\nEntrepreneurs need to be prepared for unexpected attention, \u0000attery, and\nother perks of becoming successful, especially if they’re not accustomed to this\ntype of attention. They need to be aware that if they buy their own hype, they’ll\nscreech to a halt.\nAlong those same lines, both Robert Greene and Jordan Peterson o\u0000ered me\nsimilar advice about being careful with whom you share both good news and\nbad news. Those men understand human nature and know that there are not\nmany people who will be happy for your success. Before sharing anything with\nanyone, consider who—deep down—wants to see you succeed and who wants\nto see you fail. Some people whom you consider friends may not give you the\nbest counsel, especially if they are in competition with you.\nStaying Centered Despite Uncertainty"

    "raw_text": "Here are three tactics that will allow you to keep your head while all those\naround you are losing theirs.\n1. MAKE FRIENDS WITH MURPHY’S LAW\nSavvy entrepreneurs respect Murphy’s Law. Before you launch a new product,\nmake an investment, pull the trigger on an acquisition, or make any type of\nmajor move, ask yourself this question: What are the very worst events that\nmight happen as a result of my action?\nThen take steps to mitigate those potential worst events.\nYou may be a positive thinker, which is great, but don’t be a naive one. This\nholds true for smaller events and decisions as well as big ones. If you’re about to\nmake a major presentation, check the projector, and then check it again. It may\nhave worked a hundred times \u0000awlessly in the past, but something in the\nuniverse will make sure it doesn’t work when you need to use it to make a\nPowerPoint pitch to investors. And when it doesn’t work, you’re going to be\ndealing with chaos—maybe not all-out, wreck-the-business chaos but the kind\nthat ruins both the presentation and your day. The kind that causes you to chew\nout and alienate your people. The kind that throws you o\u0000 your game and raises\nquestions from your potential investors.\nHere’s an anti–Murphy’s Law technique I use all the time. I meet with the\nbest brains on my team—no more than \u0000ve. We sit and talk about what we\nshould anticipate and prevent from going wrong. And I have to tell you,\nsometimes as a result of this anti–Murphy’s Law meeting, we decide to hold o\u0000\non a planned launch because we realize we’re not ready to proceed or that the\nodds of something big going wrong are too high. Sometimes, too, we may even\ntrash an idea that seemed like dynamite when we \u0000rst conceived of it. Having a\nbrain trust provides a valuable check and balance.\n2. ADMIT DEFEAT BY ACCEPTING SMALL LOSSES\nWhen Groupon and LivingSocial \u0000rst became popular, I saw an opportunity to\nstart a competing service. I imagined something like Groupon and Yelp,\n\f\ncombined with a gami\u0000cation component, and put $100,000 into creating and\ntesting early versions. Several investors were willing to go along on the ride with\nme, but before pulling the trigger I decided to run the idea by several trusted\nfriends. They ranged from the CEO of a large life insurance company to the\nhead of one of the largest transportation companies in the United States.\nAfter I presented my business plan and projections, they pointed out holes\nI’d missed. After answering their questions, I accepted their concerns that the\nproject would steal focus away from my successful core business. It didn’t mean\nthat the idea would fail, but there was a good chance that it would create chaos\nthat might a\u0000ect my company adversely. Anticipating Murphy’s Law, I did the\none thing that made sense: I let go of the idea.\nGreat entrepreneurs accept losses. Rather than throwing money at bad\ninvestments, they admit defeat and conserve cash for their next venture. Show\nme a losing gambler in a casino who is vowing to get even, and I’ll show you\nsomeone who is a few moves away from losing it all.\n3. IDENTIFY YOUR NEXT THREE (OR MORE) STEPS\nOnce you’ve entered a chaotic situation, you’re vulnerable to decision paralysis.\nWhen things get crazy, you might want to hunker down and play it safe. But\nentrepreneurs don’t have the luxury of inaction. You can easily forget this truth\nwhen chaos strikes.\nTo avoid this problem, commit to deciding on your next three steps quickly. I\nknow how much we talk about thinking \u0000ve moves ahead. But when you have to\nact quickly, focus on three actions you can take to address whatever problem\nyou’re facing right now. These actions can be solutions or temporary measures\nto stop the bleeding.\nFor example, a major client tells you that she’s ending your relationship. You\ncould:\nCall the sales rep who brought in the client and get the entire story.\nCall the client yourself and let her air her grievances.\nSend the client another shipment of the product, free of charge.\n\f\nAs you can see, these actions don’t have to be breakthroughs or complex\nplans. They will, however, prevent you from doing nothing as you seek the One\nPerfect Solution (which may not even exist). Don’t fall into that trap. Make a\nplan, and act on it. Things will begin to resolve themselves once you’re back in\nmotion.\nManage Your Ego and Build Alliances\nNobody becomes the CEO of a large company who doesn’t have a big ego.\nNobody. There’s nothing wrong with having a big ego—as long as you have\nbuilt a support system to keep it in check. If you can’t control it, it will lead to\nyour demise. When you become very successful and start making a lot of money\nand have fame and recognition, everyone will be looking for a way to get into\nyour wallet and inner circle. As a result, you will be \u0000ooded with compliments.\nYou’ll be inundated with praise because you’re surrounded by people who are\nafraid of the decisions you make. For instance, the members of your team may\nfear that you will \u0000re them. So they will all tell you how amazing you are. Let me\ntell you, 90 percent of it is lies. Most people are not going to tell you what you\nneed to hear.\nYou need a small circle of people around you who will tell you the truth. It’s\nthe only thing that will keep your ego in check (though having three kids helps\nas well). If you don’t have a small group of people such as a board of directors or\nmentors who aren’t afraid to tell you o\u0000, you’re going to be in trouble. I’ve seen\nthis happen in sales many times. People start making money, and everyone tells\nthem how amazing they are. They’re no longer coachable or willing to learn.\nThey don’t listen to advice. That’s a sign that they have forgotten how to\nmanage their own ego.\nStaying paranoid also means staying humble. If you don’t have humility, you\ncan’t bring people together. Without humility, people who disagree with you\nwon’t want to do business with you. How can you generate new ideas or invite\nfresh perspectives when you don’t have diversity or dissenting voices in the\nroom? When you have only people around you who agree with you, you’ll\nnaturally get complacent, which is the opposite of being paranoid.\n\f\nKeeping your ego in check means understanding that you can’t do everything\nyourself. If you’re overly paranoid, you won’t trust anyone. If you’re su\u0000ciently\nparanoid, you’ll build strong alliances. It’s important to have partners who are\nalso on the lookout for competition. Think of it as a way to increase intelligence.\nIn The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene, Law 18 states, “The world is\ndangerous and enemies are everywhere—everyone has to protect themselves. A\nfortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it\nprotects you from—it cuts you o\u0000 from valuable information, it makes you\nconspicuous and an easy target.”\nGreene makes the point that as hard as it is to trust people, the alternative,\nworking in isolation, is much worse.\nYou may be surprised at where you will \u0000nd allies. When Apple was\nstruggling in August 1997, there were few people who would help Steve Jobs.\nWhat had once seemed unthinkable—going to an enemy—became possible\nbecause he was willing to get past his ego. He bit the bullet and approached none\nother than his archnemesis, Bill Gates. All he did was ask for a minor favor: an\ninvestment by Microsoft of $150 million.\nAs reported by Stephen Silver at AppleInsider, according to Jobs, “there were\ntoo many people at Apple and in the Apple ecosystem playing the game of, for\nApple to win, Microsoft has to lose. And it was clear that you didn’t have to play\nthat game because Apple wasn’t going to beat Microsoft. Apple didn’t have to\nbeat Microsoft. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they’d\nforgotten who Apple was.”\nIn truth, it wasn’t really a “favor.” Microsoft invested $150 million in Apple\nstock, and the companies agreed to settle their existing legal disputes, saving both\n\u0000rms time and money.\nIn addition, Apple agreed to make Microsoft O\u0000ce compatible with the\nMac. In short, rivals became partners.\nImagine what would have happened if Jobs hadn’t built that alliance. We’re\nnot exactly talking about a guy with a small ego. Yet when it mattered most, he\ndidn’t get stubborn and insist that he could do everything himself. Today we can\n\f\nuse iPhones and other Apple devices because a paranoid guy with a big ego was\nman enough and smart enough to build the right alliance.\nThe next example highlights both the need for alliances and the need for\nparanoia. In August 2000, Amazon and Toys “R” Us created what the Wall\nStreet Journal called a “groundbreaking agreement: For 10 years Amazon would\ndevote part of its Web site to Toys ‘R’ Us’s toy-and-baby-products. The toy\nretailer would choose the hot products to stock and buy the inventory for the\nvirtual shelves.” Keep in mind that the dot-com bubble had burst on March 11,\n2000. Amazon was \u0000ghting for its life. In my view, if there had not been an\nalliance, there would be no Amazon. In addition to the revenue the alliance\ncreated, partnering with Toys “R” Us helped drive tra\u0000c to Amazon, which, in\nturn, helped sell other products on the site. Amazon could then keep building\nmore partnerships.\nFive years later, the two companies were facing o\u0000 in New Jersey Superior\nCourt. What had started as an alliance had turned into a war. The biggest\ncasualty was Toys “R” Us, which, in 2018, went out of business.\nThe moral of the story? Even after you build an alliance, stay paranoid!\nSeek Wise Counsel\nWhen adversity strikes, you’re going to need help. If you’ve created a wise team\n—selected them well and treated them right—they can save you when things get\ntough. You need allies, especially when your business starts to falter. They’ll give\nyou the strength to overcome obstacles, to rebound and grow.\nI’ve met many smart entrepreneurs who failed in business, but I’ve yet to\nmeet a wise one who wasn’t able to rebound. The di\u0000erence between being\nsmart and being wise is that a smart person thinks he knows all the answers while\na wise person is comfortable knowing he doesn’t. Wisdom is especially valuable\nduring chaotic times.\nHere’s how I learned this lesson. By age twenty-two, I’d racked up $49,000 in\ncredit card debt and had a credit score that failed to crack 500. My relationship\nwith my girlfriend at the time was headed into the gutter, mostly due to my"

    "raw_text": "\u0000nancial situation. I had an epiphany: if I limited myself to what I already knew,\nmy life would keep going in the same direction.\nI decided to seek wisdom. I went from making fun of nerds in school to\nbecoming the biggest nerd of all. All I wanted to do was learn. I devoured books.\nI became a sponge with my mentors. And, most important, I surrounded myself\nwith the wisest people I could \u0000nd to teach me about life and business. One of\nthose mentors gave me the questions that became the Personal Identity Audit\n(which we discussed in chapter 2 and can be found in the appendix).\nHow do you \u0000nd wise mentors? Let me share some hard-won lessons. I’ve\nworked with lots of coaches and consultants, and I have discovered that many of\nthem o\u0000er advice based on their reading rather than their experiences. It struck\nme that when it comes to mentors or advisers, you can choose from three\nexpertise levels: Theory, Witness, and Application (TWA).\nTheory. These are well-read individuals with degrees from prestigious universities. Most\nconsultants and professors fall into this category. They’re smart, but they may not be wise.\nWisdom comes from practical experience, and these people o\u0000er suggestions based on\ntheory. They will teach you how to run a business, but if you ask if they’ve ever run a\nbusiness, they will likely answer, “No, I have not. But I’ve consulted many. I’ve read all the\nbooks.” That’s a theory-level mentor. There’s nothing wrong with that. They can still give\nyou good advice, but they’re the lowest-level mentors.\nWitness. These advisers have worked directly with successful entrepreneurs and, thanks to\nthat vantage point, can tell you exactly how successful leaders built their business. For\nexample, Guy Kawasaki often shares what he learned working with Steve Jobs on the original\nMacintosh team.\nWitnesses didn’t run the business, but they worked closely with someone who did. For\nexample, if you wanted to be mentored by someone in real estate, you could ask, “Have you\never done real estate before?” If he answers, “I never have, but for ten years I was the assistant\nfor the number one real estate agent in Beverly Hills and learned a lot from her,” that’s\nvaluable right there. That person can tell you what the person did, how she worked, how she\ntreated her clients, what she did when she almost went out of business, and so on.\nApplication. Application means that the information is coming directly from the source.\nThese are the people who can tell you what they’ve done that has worked for them. The\nmost valuable mentors are those who have walked their talk. Fellow entrepreneurs can share\nwhat didn’t work in their businesses in a way that someone operating from theory or\nobservation simply can’t.\nThose who possess all three characteristics—theory, witness, and application\n—are called “trifectas.” And by the way, they’re tough to \u0000nd.\n\f\nA lot of people making YouTube videos are purely Theory and Witness. Very\nfew are Application. So again, do some due diligence to know where a mentor\nsits on the TWA hierarchy. All three of these levels can be useful, though\nApplication is far and away the best, especially when you’re trying to make your\nway through di\u0000cult periods. This is why the grand master Magnus Carlsen\nhired his former opponent, world champion Garry Kasparov, to be his coach.\nThe game of business can be ugly at times. If you have a warlike mentality, you\nwon’t take it personally. Your competitors can make you frustrated, angry, and\nconfused. You can almost guarantee that they’re going to hit below the belt.\nSimilarly, one of your top people may leave suddenly—an employee whom you\nnurtured, helped grow, and supported during his struggles. You will feel the\nsting of ingratitude. Or you may have a consumer activist group or a government\nagency on your case; you believe it’s singling you out and making you jump\nthrough hoops for no reason except that it has a grudge against you.\nRecognize how unproductive it is to take things personally. Your ego is your\nenemy. Building a business is not just ugly; it’s messy. It’s not just a cognitive\ne\u0000ort but an emotional one. When you take things personally, you get drawn\ninto the chaos and can’t think clearly. You become furious and vengeful.\nAs di\u0000cult as it may be, step back and view situations analytically. Don’t let\nfury or shame dictate your decisions. I’m not saying to strip yourself of all\nemotion. You’re entitled to whatever feelings you’re feeling. Just don’t let those\nfeelings cloud your judgment. The best entrepreneurs are able to push their\nemotional reactions aside and make objective decisions in the midst of chaos.\nShow me a successful CEO with decades of longevity, and I’ll show you a\nCEO who has stayed paranoid. Being a CEO means connecting the dots and\ndoing things in ways they haven’t been done in the past. Stay alert; stay alive.\n\f\nMOVE 4\nMaster Strategy to Scale\nSCALING FOR EXPONENTIAL GROWTH\n1. Decide how you’re going to capitalize your business. Execute strategies for both\nexponential and linear growth. Lead people by demanding their best and holding\nthem accountable.\nMAKE MOMENTUM YOUR FRIEND—AND BE PREPAREDFOR CHAOS\n2. Create strategies to increase the speed of growth without crashing your business.\nLook for ways to compress time frames. Keep your ego in check to avoid\ntemptations and being your own worst enemy.\nMONEYBALL: DESIGNING SYSTEMS TO TRACK YOURBUSINESS\n3. Decide what are the most important formulas of your business, and track them\nreligiously. Codify what’s in your head by creating manuals to transfer\nknowledge. Determine if new hires are needed to help implement this transfer of\nknowledge.\nSTAY PARANOID; THE GRAND MASTER NEVER LETSHIS GUARD DOWN\n4. As your company gets bigger, it will become more vulnerable. Know where people\ncan attack you, and stay on guard. Constantly put yourself in your enemies’\nshoes, and ask how you would put yourself out of business if you were them.\nDon’t take it personally when they try to do just that."

    "raw_text": "MOVE 5\nMASTER POWER PLAYS\n\f\n13\nHow to Beat Goliath and Control the\nNarrative\nI’m not a businessman. I’m a business, man.\n—Jay-Z\nEveryone in business has a Goliath, and it isn’t always the biggest company in\nyour industry. Your Goliath could be a company that is taking up market share\nin a particular region, or it could be more localized, such as another salesperson\nin your own sales department who has more experience and bigger, more\nlucrative accounts.\nBefore you decide to go up against Goliath, you need to know that Goliath is\nbigger than you are and has more capital, experience, and resources (especially\nattorneys) than you do. Goliath also has a well-known reputation and brand. As\na result, Goliath is more comfortable than you are.\nIf, knowing all this, you’re still dedicated and committed to taking on\nGoliath, you’d better know the obstacles you face. Hopefully, you also see an\nopportunity. If Goliath is comfortable, and, as a result, less paranoid, you have\nan opening to make your move(s).\nI want to make one thing very clear: this \u0000ght isn’t for everyone.

    "raw_text": "individuals and companies that lost everything. Beating Goliath is doable, but it\nrequires being someone who can tolerate pain. If you’re still thinking about\ntrying to do it, keep reading.\nThings to Know Before Facing a Goliath inBusiness\n1. You’ll be afraid. As scary as the thought of losing money is, it may be even more painful to\nyour ego to put yourself out there and fail.\n2. You’ll have panic attacks and anxiety. If you don’t, it’s a sure sign that you haven’t put\nyourself out there. Putting yourself out there means you have to devote everything you’ve got\nto delivering. That’s going to cause tremendous stress.\n3. You’ll be bullied and laughed at. This will result not only from trying to take on Goliath\nbut also from even thinking it’s possible. It will bring a lot of scrutiny, so you’d better brace\nyourself for negative attention.\n4. You have to be delusional. In this case, being crazy will actually work in your favor. You’d\nbetter be a bit “o\u0000” if you think you can dethrone Goliath.\n5. You’ll have to work ten times harder than you think. Just when you think you are at\nyour limit, it will take ten times that to defeat Goliath. Time with your family, of course, will\ndecrease, and you can pretty much forget about hobbies, which is why it isn’t for just anyone.\n6. You’ll have to stay healthy to have the energy to compete. I’ve worked myself into\nexhaustion and hospitalization multiple times. It’s helped me build a tolerance for hard work\nas each time I’ve come roaring back even harder. I’m telling you this not because I want you to\nfear burning out, but so you can be prepared for doing so when you’re in the throes of \u0000ghting\nGoliath.\nIn Move 2, when we broke down the Solve for X Methodology, I told you the\nstory about how Aegon sued me right when I started my business and how it\nnearly put us out of business. Goliath had me by the throat and nearly took me\ndown for the count. Once I escaped, I had the con\u0000dence to beat Goliath. More\nimportant, I understood why he could be beaten.\nWhy Goliaths Can Be Beaten\nAre you still not afraid? That’s great to hear, because I’m about to hit you with\nthe good news: if you’re prepared for the battle, you can win. Here’s why:\nGoliaths tend to get softer the more they win and eventually stop working as\nhard as they once did. Goliaths typically lose touch with the most current\n\f\nmethods of marketing, since they rarely speak directly to customers. Goliath\nisn’t as nimble as you. Goliath has too much to lose to take risks.\nGoliath can’t recruit the crazy and hungry people because the crazy ones are\nturned on by underdogs who aspire to take out a Goliath. They would much\nrather go up against Goliath than join him. This explains why so many people\nwere critical of Kevin Durant when he joined the Golden State Warriors the year\nafter they broke the NBA record with seventy-three wins in a season. It may also\nexplain why Durant left “Goliath” after winning two titles in three seasons.\nEven if you are up for the challenge, you must always respect Goliath. One\nounce of complacency, and it will knock you out. Goliaths didn’t get to where\nthey are by pure luck. They are formidable for a reason. This makes it that much\nmore rewarding when you defeat them. Here’s how you can do so.\nA Dozen Ways to Beat Goliath\n1. Know your weaknesses. Knowing your strengths is easy, but knowing your weaknesses will\nenable you to be nimble and pivot when taking on your Goliath.\n2. Know Goliath’s weaknesses. You cannot \u0000ght Goliath where it is strong. You must \u0000nd its\nAchilles heel and exploit it.\n3. Master three things you do better. You set the terms of your battle in the marketplace.\nUse your strengths to master three things Goliath can’t do and do them better than it can.\n4. Don’t try to be Goliath. You can learn moves and information from Goliath, but if you\nmodel yourself after it, how are you going to beat it? You have to take advantage of your own\nstrength, not someone else’s.\n5. Focus on specializing. Goliaths tend to generalize in order to spread their in\u0000uence and\npower. You must specialize to capture market share from them.\n6. When you’re small, make yourself appear bigger. Walk tall, and don’t be intimidated\nby Goliath’s size and strength. Embody your future truth and compete as though you’re the\none with the advantage.\n7. Keep a low proﬁle initially. You are going to need a lot of help, and you will need time to\nget better. Don’t waste your early years rubbing people the wrong way and making noise.\nWork on your business \u0000rst before looking for a Goliath to \u0000ght.\n8. Move quickly. Use your inherent advantages of strength and speed against Goliath. It can’t\nmove as fast as you can.\n9. Partner with competitors that share an enemy. Goliaths create a lot of enemies. Look\nfor your synergies with those enemies, and build strategic alliances.\n10. Study history. History can give you context and strategies that you never even thought of in\nyour \u0000ght against Goliath. Knowledge is out there for you to harvest and can only help you.\n11. Let other competitors wear your opponents down. Goliaths must fend o\u0000 a lot of\ncompetitors, and you don’t always need to be on the front lines. Standing back and letting"

    "raw_text": "someone else take the spotlight can help you focus your resources better and give you an\nadvantage over Goliaths.\n12. Don’t disclose every aspect of your strategy. To a grand master, this should be self-\nexplanatory.\nControlling the Narrative\nIt’s time to think about how and what to broadcast to the world, since all eyes\nare going to be on you. If you don’t talk about what you believe in, what your\nviews are, and who you are as an individual, the world is going to decide who\nyou are. It’s up to you to control the narrative and talk about what you’re\ndealing with. If you don’t, others will.\nSocial media is the great equalizer.\nWhen I started my agency, Goliath used every resource it had to bully me. My\ncompetitors said horrible things about me and made up nasty rumors that could\neasily have ruined my reputation. That was when I fully grasped the fact that\nusing social media properly would allow me to control the narrative.\nThere are many di\u0000erent forms of bullying. It has evolved over the years.\nWhen your company is small, people will defame your character and spread\nrumors. I realized that the way to \u0000ght back was by controlling the narrative.\nWhen people heard awful things about me, they would turn to Google to\ncon\u0000rm their suspicions. And what did they \u0000nd? That the monster they had\nheard about was very di\u0000erent from the guy they were watching online. I was\nable to control the narrative, and as a result, many of the people who heard\nnegative gossip about me ended up becoming my partners.\nThink about how di\u0000erent this was in a pre-internet world. Steve Jobs had to\ncall Playboy to ask it to write a story about him that o\u0000ered his narrative. From\nthe time Jobs did the interview until the time people saw it, two months had\nelapsed! Now two milliseconds elapse between your writing something online\nand people reading what you’ve written.\nGoliath can spend millions of dollars on PR. Meanwhile, you can make a\nvideo with an iPhone and get more views—and make a bigger impact.\n\f\nWhen you post, really share yourself. We’ve been brainwashed that\nprofessionalism means only putting our best foot forward. The problem is that\npeople don’t connect with perfect robots. They connect with all of who you are.\nShow your mistakes, and be vulnerable. If you talk only about what you do\nright, it’s a turno\u0000. There’s no way in the world anyone can make it to the top\nwithout making mistakes. People identify with you more when you share your\ndown moments.\nPeople will also identify with you if you challenge them to question your\nviews. Ask them to share their thoughts. Ask for speci\u0000c recommendations to\nsolve problems. One, you’ll learn something. Two, you’ll increase your viewers’\nor readers’ engagement.\nAnother key to connecting with your audience is to be consistent. Your\naudience should know when they are going to hear from you and rely on a\nregular schedule of content. Two best-selling authors have di\u0000erent approaches.\nPeople following Seth Godin know they can expect a short and thoughtful daily\nblog post. Daniel Pink, on the other hand, sends out his Pinkcast every other\nweek. The key to both strategies is that each one’s audience has an expectation\nthat is met.\nGoing hand in hand with consistency is integrity. Especially as you gain a\nfollowing, you are going to get proposals to promote other people. Do not\nprostitute your brand. If you’re going to take on a sponsor, you need to be\naligned with that brand. Your followers will appreciate you if you stay solid with\nyour message and don’t sell out. This is going to require you to delay\ngrati\u0000cation and refuse a quick buck in order to play the long game of\nmaintaining your integrity.\nBe Shameless About Self-Promotion\nThe \u0000rst rule of self-promotion is that you have to be shameless. What holds\npeople back is the fear of being judged. Visionaries have gotten past that. You\ncan’t be afraid of judgment when promoting yourself. You want people to\nnotice you. Phil Knight of Nike is shameless. Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys\nis shameless. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is shameless. Kevin Hart is\n\f\nshameless. Do you think Hart reached nearly 100 million Instagram followers by\nbeing timid? If you’re not shameless, no one is going to know who you are.\nWhat holds us back from being shameless is the fear of humiliation. So what\nif you’re humiliated? Do you know anyone who’s not been humiliated? The\npeople no one knows anything about—the people hiding in safe corporate jobs.\nWhen I say “Be shameless,” I don’t mean you should brag. I mean that you\nshould do as much as you can (within your narrative and brand) to make sure\nyou get eyeballs. Self-promotion is an art form.\nYou may feel uncomfortable bragging, but you can do it in subtle ways\nthrough the stories you tell. Let’s say you’re in an attorney’s o\u0000ce and he or she\nhas some plaques on the wall. You could say, “You know, these are impressive\nplaques. Listen, I can tell you that to be recognized as a top attorney takes a lot\nof work. I respect that because when I got my plaque for being the top broker in\nour company, I remember the e\u0000ort it took to get there. What’s crazy is that\nmany times people don’t see the e\u0000ort behind closed doors. So I applaud you for\nwhat you did.”\nAnother way to self-promote is by making predictions. Make some\npredictions based on your intuition and research. Why is that important?\nBecause if even some of your predictions come true, you gain credibility and\nlook like a sage.\nNow, some people may say, “What dumb advice, Pat. Are you really telling\nme to put myself out there? What if I’m wrong and end up being humiliated?”\nConsider the alternative: never being wrong and no one knowing who you are.\nConor McGregor, the former UFC champion, said, “I’m cocky in\nprediction. I am con\u0000dent in preparation, but I am always humble in victory or\ndefeat.” He shamelessly puts himself out there, and win or lose, McGregor\nalways controls the narrative by making bold predictions.\nGreat real estate developers also make predictions. So do great stockbrokers.\nThey put themselves into the news. You think Jim Cramer landed a TV show by\nbeing timid or never going out on a limb? His show isn’t called Shy Money; it’s\ncalled Mad Money. He gets people talking about him. Some say he’s an idiot;\nothers swear by his advice. I’ve never met Jim Cramer, but I can bet he’s\nlaughing all the way to the bank."

    "raw_text": "Don’t be afraid to make predictions within your industry. Again, think about\nthe framing. Here are some titles of articles by the investment adviser and\npersonality Peter Schi\u0000.\n“Peter Schi\u0000: Negative Interest Rates Are Boneheaded”\n“Peter Schi\u0000: The Only Winners Will Be the People Who Bought Gold and Silver”\n“Peter Schi\u0000: Whatever the Fed Is Going to Do Will Stink to High Heaven”\nSchi\u0000 has been singing the same tune for decades. Sometimes he’s right, and\nsometimes he’s not. But he’s always in the news. He self-promotes. He makes\nbold predictions. And as a result, he has become synonymous with investing in\ngold. When a \u0000nancial TV show is looking for an expert on gold, Schi\u0000 gets the\ncall.\nI realize I’ve thrown a lot of examples at you. To summarize, the most\nimportant tenets of social media are:\nHave a personality.\nBe bold.\nBe brash (if that’s who you are).\nBe engaging.\nTrumpet yourself when you’re right.\nPoke fun at yourself when you’re wrong.\nAccept the loss when you’re wrong.\nPromotion is something you must constantly be doing. Here’s another\ntechnique. Instead of name-dropping, book-drop. Let’s say you’re sitting in a\nmeeting and in response to a comment, you say, “One of the books I read was\nsuch and such, and in this book it talks about this, and I feel like this is what’s\ngoing on here with the company. And I recommend that book to you.” If the\nother people in the meeting are ambitious, they’ll write down the name of the\nbook. If you can give two or three book recommendations in a business\nconversation with somebody, in that person’s mind you’re a well-read\nautodidact. Whether you have a college degree or not is irrelevant.\nThe next way to self-promote is to have strong opinions about subjects\nwithin your \u0000eld of expertise. For instance, you may say you don’t agree with\nwhere the marketplace is going or talk about one of the mistakes the industry is\n\f\nmaking. A great place to do this is on your blog, vlog, or podcast. When the\ntopic comes up, you can say, “You know, I recently wrote a blog about this. It\ncreated a lot of controversy because my belief was such and such. I’ll send it to\nyou so you can read it.”\nI wrote an article about why home ownership is not the American dream. It\nblew up. Fox contacted me. CNN contacted me. The Denver Post did a feature\non it. It wrote about this entrepreneur who doesn’t believe in home ownership.\nThat was my opinion. It created so much controversy just because I wrote one\narticle saying what the real American dream is and that it’s not home ownership,\nit’s entrepreneurship. So share your thoughts and opinions, and then self-\npromote the articles you write.\nYou need to have a level of certainty about what you’re talking about. People\ncan tell the di\u0000erence between certainty and uncertainty. Believe me, it’s not that\nhard to know when somebody is certain about what he or she is talking about.\nHaving certainty alone is a way of self-promoting.\nDon’t overdo it, and don’t make things up. Have an opinion, have evidence\nfor that opinion, and state that opinion with certainty.\nMy challenge to you is to self-promote. Put your fear of being judged aside,\nand put yourself out there. Say or do something bold. Let people know who you\nare and what you stand for.\nAlign Your Brand with Your Master Vision\nWhen I \u0000rst started creating content on YouTube, I named the channel Patrick\nBet-David and called the segments “Two Minutes with Pat.” As I thought more\nabout my vision for its content, I realized that the channel was about education.\nI wanted to provide value and entertainment that would inspire entrepreneurs\naround the world.\nMy unselﬁsh reason for creating the content was to give back. I wanted to\no\u0000er everything I wish I’d had when I transitioned from salesperson to\nentrepreneur and later to CEO. I made a list of the questions I’d had at every\nphase of my career when I’d felt powerless and clueless—and I went about\nanswering them. I was also committed to doing it in a way that was interesting.\n\f\nSo many of us struggled in school because the approach was so damn boring. I\nwanted to create content that would make people want to watch it—that they\ncould learn from and be entertained by at the same time.\nI also had two selﬁsh reasons for creating content. One was for my kids and\n(future) grandkids to have access to what I thought about life. I visualized my\nkids one day binge-watching the content—maybe at a time when they think I\nmight not be too happy with them, only to realize that Daddy loves them.\nThe second reason? You guessed it. To control my narrative.\nGetting back to my business reasons for creating Valuetainment, I realized\nthat to scale the brand, I would need to take the focus o\u0000 me and direct it to the\nvision.\nI imagine you spotted the problem quickly. The title of the weekly segment\n—“Two Minutes with Pat”—was all about me. It had nothing to do with my\nvision.\nYou’ve heard me talk passionately about how to think like a chess grand\nmaster. When it comes to launching a new idea with a massive vision, it’s time to\nput the mindset of a grand master to use and plot \u0000fteen moves ahead. Are some\ncoming to mind? Can you put yourself in my shoes back then and strategize how\nto go from a struggling solopreneur making videos to a leading educator? I’m\nguessing that you may even be thinking of some things I missed. And when you\nsee my list, you’re probably going to poke holes in my strategy. Yes! Please do.\nAll right, time to take a look at how I implemented my plan to take my video\nseries to where it is today.\nFifteen Moves to Transform a Weekly Segmentinto a Channel Focused on Entrepreneurship\n1. Spend alone time getting clear on the vision.\n2. Consult with our creative team to brainstorm new names for the channel.\n3. Buy and study every book on marketing and media that exists.\n4. Identify who we don’t want to be as much as who we want to be.\n5. Make the channel about the mission rather than my personality.\n6. Create a new logo, name, and website that embodies a leading educator.\n7. Attend social media industry conferences to learn di\u0000erent strategies.\n8. Start learning the language of media and what needs to be tracked.\n\f\n9. Hire people in areas where we are weak. In the next ninety days, hire an expert in SEO (Search\nEngine Optimization).\n10. Gradually increase the rate of posted content.\n11. In the next thirty days, hire a full-time editor.\n12. Map out a strategy for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube—and be prepared to act\nquickly if the next social media app overtakes the big four.\n13. Present myself as an expert in the marketplace. Write an article as an expert and post it on\nmultiple platforms.\n14.  Create clear criteria for which guests to invite on the show that match the brand of\nValuetainment.\n15. I’m keeping this one quiet for now. This next move will be revealed soon enough.\nThe result of those \u0000fteen moves? We changed the name to Valuetainment,\nand the rest is history. Today, Valuetainers around the world have watched\nbillions of minutes of content. What’s been fascinating is that each time I’ve\nchosen to touch on a new topic, a new audience has shown up from that\ncommunity. It’s led to many business deals and contacts that have helped cement\nthe brand and, as a by-product, attract business to my company. As of May\n2020, we have more than 2.3 million YouTube subscribers and are the leading\nchannel on entrepreneurship.\nTurn Oﬀ the Noise and Cut the Fat\nIn 2005, the National Science Foundation published an article stating that the\naverage person has between twelve thousand and sixty thousand thoughts per\nday. Of those, 80 percent are negative and 95 percent are exactly the same as\nthose of the day before.\nA major power move is turning o\u0000 the noise. Once you start controlling your\nown narrative, you also need to reduce the time you spend paying attention to\neverybody else’s noise. Do you think big thinkers are paying attention to\ncelebrity gossip? Do you think they obsess over the news? They do get the bullet\npoints in the morning because they need to stay informed about current events,\nbut they don’t waste time with conspiracy theories or clickbait. That’s way too\nmuch noise.\nAlso, turn o\u0000 the noise of negative friends and small thinkers. Turn o\u0000 the\nnoise of family members who don’t support what you want to do. Don’t even\n\f\nbring up ideas in front of them if you know you’ll hear only negativity. Turn o\u0000\nthe noise. Stop any distractions and negativity. Remember, there is a big\ndi\u0000erence between someone who will give you constructive criticism and\nsomeone who is just downright negative.\nYou also need to cut the fat out of your life. If playing video games isn’t how\nyou plan to make money, cut them out. If you have multiple boyfriends or\ngirlfriends or you party at a nightclub three times a week, stop it! If you post\ntwenty sel\u0000es a day or check your fantasy football team score every thirty\nseconds, cut it out! If you have bad habits and vices that no one knows about,\n\u0000nd ways to take control of them.\nAnything that holds you back from thinking big needs to stop. You know\nexactly what I’m talking about. I don’t need to explain it to you. Think about it.\nRight now you’re thinking about what you need to cut. The thing that you’re\nthinking about? Cut it, right now. It’s holding you back, and it’s not worth it. It\nwon’t give you as much ful\u0000llment as thinking big and carrying out your vision.\nLet me give you an example. I love women. When I was younger and single, if\nyou wanted someone to go clubbing with and have a great time, I was that guy. I\nwas being interviewed on a radio talk show, and I was talking about my plans\nand goals. One of the hosts asked me, “What’s the biggest thing that changed in\nyour life?”\nI told them, “When I was in my mid-twenties, I made the decision not to\nhave sex again until I made my \u0000rst million.”\n“So you must have made that million really fast.”\nUnfortunately, no. I “fasted” for seventeen months. It was di\u0000cult. But\ndoing so accomplished two things simultaneously. First, it provided me with the\ndiscipline and motivation I needed to achieve my goal. Second, it forced me to\nspend my time on what mattered. Before setting that goal, I was spending so\nmany hours in clubs, not to mention all the mental energy it required to meet\nand court women. That was nothing but noise. Once I replaced that noise with\nrevenue-producing activities, my productivity skyrocketed—and I eventually\nmet my wife and settled down with her.\nThere’s no margin for error if you want to beat Goliath. You can’t a\u0000ord to\nwaste time if you want to succeed at the highest level. Wasting time also impacts\n\f\nyour social media strategy. Thank goodness Instagram didn’t exist during my\npartying days or else you’d \u0000nd some strange pictures all over social media.\nI’m not telling you that you should copy my example. I’m not a typical guy,\nand what worked for me probably won’t work for you. I would tell you that if\nyou are aware what your weakness is—stu\u0000ng yourself with desserts, binge-\nwatching TV, obsessively following sports—you can put your focus there. Some\npeople think nothing of spending all day Sunday watching football and another\nthree and a half hours watching Monday Night Football. That’s more than\nthirteen hours. So maybe you don’t quit your fantasy football league or stop\nwatching your favorite team’s games. But if you limit watching football to one\ngame a week, you’ve just reclaimed ten hours a week. Can you imagine what\nadding an entire day to your workweek will do?\nSelf-discipline can take many forms. You can impose limits on how much\ntime you waste sur\u0000ng the web. You can dedicate \u0000ve hours daily to working on\nthe most important task for your business. You can assess threats to your\nbusiness at least once every day. The rigor in such actions will pay o\u0000. Exerting\nself-discipline results in continued excellence.\nFuture Truth Versus Positive A\u0000rmations\nWe just saw that you have up to sixty thousand thoughts a day. What runs\nthrough your mind matters—a lot.\nGiven the huge success of the book and \u0000lm The Secret, positive a\u0000rmations\nhave become all the rage. People have begun to believe that words are so\npowerful, we can “speak things into existence.” To me, the Law of Attraction is\nboth real and misunderstood. That’s why I want you to understand the\ndi\u0000erence between living your future truth and using positive a\u0000rmations.\nI’m not against motivational quotes or positive messages, I just \u0000nd them\nuseless without emotion and conviction behind them. You have to \u0000nd the right\na\u0000rmation along with a story of validation that makes it real to you. Instead of\n“I am great. I am powerful. I am abundant,” you want to say, “I am powerful\nbecause the time my family needed me to come through for them, I stepped up\nand handled the situation.”"

To do the same for\nyourself, here’s what you do:\nDo a mental inventory and write down:\n1. Your \u0000ve most painful moments\n2. Your \u0000ve most successful moments\n3. Five moments when you felt untouchable\nState the a\u0000rmations and include thevalidation:\n1. Start with “I will be a great leader” or “I’m going to make the greatest comeback ever.”\n2. Add the story, drawing on your pain and triumphs. Use the word “because” to provide the\nevidence: “Because I came through”; “Because I’ve been there before”; “Because I’ve overcome\nmore.”\nPeople ask me: What gave you con\u0000dence to be who you are today? Four\nthings:\n1. Fate: I believe I’m destined to do something big.\n2. Faith: I believe that a higher power has my back.\n3. I became clear about what I wanted. I cast my vision. I told the world who I wanted to be, and\nthe right people showed up.\n4. I believe I’m the luckiest man alive.\nIt’s about, in this very moment, embodying your future truth. When you\nimagine your future truth, you already have what you want and now it’s about\nbecoming the person needed for that to become a reality.\nThere’s a great example in the 1996 \u0000lm Swingers, when Vince Vaughn’s\ncharacter, Trent, is coaching Jon Favreau’s character, Mikey, on how to meet\nwomen. Mikey is scared and timid. He seems light-years away from turning into\na con\u0000dent guy. But he wants to impress a woman now—not after years of\ntraining. Trent understands this. Instead of telling his buddy to “act as if,” he\nuses emotion to urge Mikey to embody his future truth. Like a coach speaking\nto a player or a director speaking to an actor, he says:"

I want you to be like the guy in the rated-R movie, you know? The\nguy you’re not sure whether or not you like yet. You’re not sure where he’s coming from, okay?\nYou’re a bad man. You’re a bad man. You’re a bad man.\nThis is not deep psychology; it’s a commonsense power move. If you don’t\nthink you are worthy, others won’t, either. If you don’t believe in your product\n(or yourself), no one else will, either. If you look like a slob, you’re going to act\nlike a slob, and people will perceive you as a slob. As we see in this movie scene,\nwe often need a coach to push us to embody our future truth.\nIf you’re going to “speak your story into existence,” you’d better have the\nright story and the emotions to back it up. And if you’re going to broadcast it to\nthe world, you’d better back up the talk by living it. That’s how you control your\nlife’s narrative.\nIncremental Growth: How Much Can You\nBench-Press?\nI hope your mind is racing a mile a minute. I want you to be so \u0000red up that you\ngrind your foot into Goliath’s throat until he begs for mercy. I hope you have\nalready made a bold prediction on social media and have taken steps to control\nyour narrative. I also understand that all this may seem daunting. Here’s where\nwe take a step back and remember that it takes time. Rather than feeling\noverwhelmed, start breaking down your goals into small steps.\nWhen I was fourteen years old, I was more than six feet tall and weighed only\n135 pounds. I mentioned before that our family couldn’t a\u0000ord the monthly\nmembership fee of $13.50 at the YMCA. Probably because I was so skinny, some\nof the guys took pity on me and opened the back door for me to sneak in. All the\npeople there called me “the Somalian”—not a nice or politically correct term but\none that tells you that I looked as though a sti\u0000 breeze would knock me over. I\nwas embarrassed by how skinny I was, so I wore sweaters to hide my slight\nphysique.\nA guy named Fred who worked out at the Y took an interest in me. When we\nwere in the weight room, he noticed that I was looking at other lifters who had\n\f\nhuge muscles. He could tell that I was discouraged by what I saw; they seemed as\nthough they belonged to a di\u0000erent species. Fred watched me struggle to bench-\npress forty-\u0000ve pounds. That’s right, with just the bar alone, I could manage\nonly one repetition.\n“That’s okay,” Fred said. He pointed to a 2½-pound plate and said, “That’s\nyour best friend.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Moving forward, I want you to improve your press by \u0000ve pounds [one 2½-\npound plate on each side] every week and see what happens.”\n“That’s embarrassing,” I said, referring to the small weight increment.\n“Don’t worry about it, just do it and see what happens.”\nReluctantly, I followed Fred’s advice. Gradually, I could lift a bit more each\nweek. Gradually, I got bigger and stronger. I persisted. I followed Fred’s advice\nwith religious devotion. After eighteen weeks, just as Fred had predicted, I could\nbench-press 135 pounds. After a few years, I was bench-pressing 385 pounds. I\nlooked like the guys I’d used to envy.\nTranslate this 2½-pound principle to your business and career. Stop\ncomparing yourself to people and companies that seem light-years ahead of you.\nInstead, focus on regular, achievable improvement.\nI guarantee you that other people and companies will be vulnerable if you\nfollow this regimen. Even Goliaths get lazy. Goliaths can be beaten because they\nrest on their laurels at some point. Remember how we talked about so many of\nthe Fortune 500 companies from 1955 that were no longer on the list in 2019?\nCommitting to incremental success will help you outimprove anyone. If you\ncan outimprove others, you will catch up to them and pass them. They may be\nbigger than you, but eventually they will slow down and start celebrating their\nvictories. While that is happening, those who quietly keep improving themselves\nand their company will suddenly show up and surprise them. The commitment\nto constantly beating your prior best is by far the simplest and best-proven\nformula to eventually \u0000nd yourself at the top of your game in your industry.\n\f\nWe covered a lot of material in this chapter. By now I know you can handle it.\nWe looked at what’s required to beat Goliath and what makes Goliath\nvulnerable, as well as speci\u0000c steps you can take to beat the giant in your\nindustry.\nYou have let go of your fear of being judged and seen the importance of self-\npromotion. Because you understand that social media is the great equalizer, you\nare on your way to creating a strategy that best suits your skills. In doing so, you\nwill be controlling the narrative.\nIf you want to achieve greatness, you have zero margin for error. You can’t\nallow negative thoughts, negative people, or negative activities to distract you.\nIt’s time to be honest about what’s holding you back and cut that fat from your\nlife."

But hear me out. In a way, mobsters are the ultimate\nentrepreneurs. They’re willing to take big risks for big rewards. And the most\nsuccessful among them are brilliant at negotiating. They have to think on their\nfeet, and they have to make the right decisions quickly at the same time that lots\nof information is coming at them.\nLet me be clear: I’m not suggesting that you run your business in unethical or\ncriminal ways. I shouldn’t have to state the obvious, but I will anyway: I’m\nagainst murder, extortion, and drug dealing. I’m against breaking the law, but\nI’m all for breaking rules. There’s a big di\u0000erence between the two. To disrupt a\nmarket or to tap into a market that’s extremely competitive, a founder has to be\ncomfortable breaking the rules. This chapter is not an endorsement of bad guys;\nit’s about learning from what they do well.\nIn September 2012, I asked everyone in my company to read The 48 Laws of\nPower by Robert Greene. The goal was not to become manipulative or learn\nhow to play games. The goal was to understand those laws so they couldn’t be\nused against us.

    "raw_text": "the book to try to take us down. We needed to better understand how such\npeople think in order to combat their tactics.\nThere’s a reason why so many CEOs and leaders consider The Godfather\n(parts I and II) more education than entertainment. Every struggle a CEO or a\nfounder will experience occurs in those movies. Betrayal, loss, recruiting,\nnegotiation, working with family, stealing money, having to get rid of someone\nwith loose lips, and having success get to their head are things mobsters deal with\n—and you will as well.\nIt’s why I’ve interviewed so many mobsters for my YouTube channel—guys\nsuch as “Sammy the Bull” Gravano, Frank Cullotta, Ralph Natale, and Donnie\nBrasco himself, Joe Pistone. You may think you’re in a competitive \u0000eld, but\nconsider the fact that mobsters have competitors who literally kill to win. You\nscrew up, you lose your business; they screw up, they lose their lives. Most\nmobsters aren’t operating under any illusions; they know exactly what they’re\ngetting into.\nNetworking, negotiating, and selling are power moves that will have a massive\nimpact on your bottom line. Mobsters are masters at recruiting because they\nknow how to sell the dream of the bene\u0000ts of joining their team. The ability to\nattract, in\u0000uence, and convince people from all walks of life is the special talent\nevery entrepreneur needs.\nI have found that former mob members are some of the best teachers.\nBecause the stakes are so high, often life and death, they are experts at\ncommunication, preparation, and reading other people. They are also master\npsychologists and negotiators. These are skills that can be learned by anyone.\nStudying mobsters is a great place to start. Let’s see how.\nA Made Man Knows How to Prepare\nMichael Franzese was reputedly one of the highest-money-making caporegime\n(captain, not boss) in the history of organized crime. Michael walked away from\n“the life” and left his criminal past behind. Still, he’s been compared to the\n\u0000ctional Michael Corleone character in the Godfather movies for good reason:\n\f\nboth Michaels share the ability to process information with lightning-quick\nspeed and thrive in stressful situations.\nYears ago, when Michael was still working for the Mob, he was summoned\nfor a meeting with his boss in Brooklyn. He recalled that the short walk from the\ncar to the apartment was the longest walk he had ever taken. His boss confronted\nhim with the rumor that Michael had stolen $2 billion from the government. It\nwasn’t that the mobsters cared about the rumor that he had taken money from\nthe government; they just cared that if it were true, they would get their cut. It\nwas a life-or-death situation; Michael knew that when he walked into the room,\nhe might not walk out if the boss thought he was withholding a tribute.\nBecause the stakes of a meeting like this were life and death, Michael was\nobsessive about preparation. He’s not big on lists, but I am. Here are seven\nthings you must do before any meeting.\nSeven Essential Steps to Prepare for a Meeting\n1. Consider the other party’s needs, desires, and frustrations. Remember that what motivates\nmost people is fear, greed, and saving face.\n2. Anticipate what the other party will say.\n3. Develop a script/outline for what you want to say.\n4. Role-play the meeting several times in order to be prepared for di\u0000erent reactions.\n5. Ask trusted advisers to point out your blind spots.\n6. Put yourself into the best possible frame of mind before the meeting.\n7. Build a reputation for overdelivering on your product.\nBecause he had prepared well, Michael didn’t cower or quake. He didn’t\nexplode. Instead, he addressed the accusation head-on: “When they [the media]\nwrite about someone else [other mobsters], it’s a lie. When they write about me,\nall of a sudden, it’s the truth? I’m giving you guys all this money [$2 million\nweekly]; you don’t have to do anything, I’m taking care of everything…. If\nanybody goes down, it’s me and my crew. What’s going on here?”\nMichael showed some emotion. It was all part of his plan. During his\npreparation, he had decided that the best plan of action would be to set his\nadversary back on his heels. Even a seasoned mobster like Michael has emotions,\nand there’s no doubt that he was upset. He was processing the situation, and he\n\f\ntold himself that he would have to watch what he said and did. He remained\nrespectful of his boss.\nOnce Michael threw his opening punch, he sat back and listened. He learned\nthat the whole situation was a result of his father, John “Sonny” Franzese,\nthrowing him under the bus. Michael’s father thought it was possible that\nMichael was making more money than he was disclosing, and this meeting was\ndesigned to determine the truth.\nImagine you’re in a life-and-death meeting and you’ve just learned that a\nfamily member, close friend, or a business partner has sold you out. You would\nprobably be seething. Submerged in all that emotion would be your ability to\nthink and process. How can you think about solutions and survival when all you\ncan think about is revenge?\nEven though he was hurt by his father’s actions, Michael processed the\nsituation like a master. He remained calm in front of the boss and told him he\nwould take care of the issue. He even thanked his boss for bringing the issue to\nhis attention. He could not have done so had he not rehearsed every minute of\nthe meeting beforehand.\nOnce the meeting was complete, Michael had to process the impact of his\nfather selling him out. He knew not to talk to his father until he had worked\nthrough these issues on his own. After much thought, Michael came to terms\nwith his father’s actions. He knew that the life could separate a father and son.\nHe refused to let that happen. He never mentioned the incident to his father.\nHe told himself, “In that life, you learn to keep things quiet until the right time.\nBut it really put me on notice that I’ve got to be careful. I was very disappointed\nin him, but it didn’t change my love for him.”\nGreat processors take responsibility for their actions and redirect their\nfrustration to learning and creating new patterns. When Michael re\u0000ected on\nwhat his dad had done, he said, “I almost thank him for it now. I met my wife\ntwo years after this incident, and that’s when I made the decision to walk away….\nI think that was God’s way of separating me from this bond or hold that my dad\nhad on me.”\nProblem solving isn’t easy. In the heat of the moment, Michael had to defend\nhimself credibly but at the same time not appear defensive. A lot of thoughts\n\f\nmust have been swirling in his brain, but he processed them under pressure and\ncame up with the right solution. The real brilliance was in what was not seen: his\nobsessive preparation.\nThe Art of the Sit-Down: Preparing for a\nHigh-Stakes Meeting\nThe \u0000ve big Ma\u0000a families relied on a business resolution method called the sit-\ndown. In ways, it was similar to what goes on in business, where the top people\nget together in the boardroom to discuss important matters. In Michael’s world,\nthough, the meeting place was often the back room of an Italian restaurant.\nI had a sit-down recently in the Cayman Islands with the senior executives of\none of the world’s largest insurance companies. The CEO was in the room, as\nwere two other senior vice presidents. My purpose in being there was to request\nan increase in my company’s compensation.\nThe stakes were high. The worst possible scenario was that they would be so\no\u0000ended by my demand that they would drop my account. That would have\nbeen catastrophic for my business. Another bad scenario would be if they\nrefused to give me an increase. If that happened, I risked losing many of my\nagents because I simply wouldn’t have enough revenue to pay them as much as\nmy competitors did.\nIt was a tough request to a tough audience at a tough time in my business.\nThese are the types of meetings that can wreck you emotionally—if you lack the\ntools to process and prepare for them. Therefore, I followed the \u0000rst rule of sit-\ndowns: Do not attend a meeting unprepared. As is always the case, I used the\n“Seven Essential Steps to Prepare for a Meeting” to guide my preparation. Like\nany grand master, I was planning many moves ahead.\n1. Consider the other party’s needs, desires, and frustrations.Remember that what motivates most people is fear, greed, andsaving face.\nBefore the meeting, I had assessed what the executives’ frustrations were and\nwho wrote the most business for their company, as well as our company’s\nstanding with them. I did my homework and found out that, in two years, we\n\f\nhad skyrocketed from a small player to the \u0000rm that wrote the second highest\nnumber of policies of all the companies with which they dealt.\nIn The 7 Habits of Highly Eﬀective People, Stephen Covey said, “Seek \u0000rst to\nunderstand, then to be understood.” What that meant for me was getting out of\nmy own head and walking in their shoes to see the situation from their\nperspective.\nI played on fear: Losing my account would have meant their company’s losing millions of\ndollars in revenue.\nI played on greed: Keeping my account would potentially bring in even more millions of\ndollars of revenue and seven-\u0000gure bonuses for the executives.\nI played on helping them save face: They would look really foolish if I left for a\ncompetitor.\n2. Anticipate what the other party will say.\nThink about how a shrewd attorney crafts an argument: he \u0000rst has to consider\nwhat the other party will say. The more you can anticipate what the other party\nwill say and why, the better you can craft your story or request.\n3. Develop a script/outline for what you want to say.\nI started out with pages of notes. As I continued to practice, I was able to\nbecome more precise about my message. How you prepare depends on your\nstyle. Some speakers like to write out their entire speech, and some simply need\nbullet points. I prefer bullet points.\n4. Role-play the meeting several times in order to be prepared fordiﬀerent reactions.\nThe next step was to assemble a team and ask them to play the roles of the\nexecutives I was going to be meeting in the Cayman Islands. Stepping into the\nshoes of those executives, they asked questions and challenged me. As a result, I\nmodi\u0000ed my script and was prepared for di\u0000erent reactions.\n5. Ask trusted advisers to point out your blind spots.\nMuch of this was handled during role-plays.

    "raw_text": "6. Put yourself into the best possible frame of mind before themeeting.\nEvery detail before I arrived at the meeting mattered. I \u0000ew in a day early, so I\nwould be rested and didn’t have any fear of a delayed \u0000ight making me late. The\nway I dressed, what I ate, and my exercise routine were all part of putting me\ninto the right frame of mind. Visualizing the success of the meeting—and my\nbusiness—was also a critical step.\n7. Build a reputation for overdelivering on your promises.\nNone of the above matters if you don’t do what you’re going to do. The worst\nthing you want in business is to have a reputation as someone who does a lot of\ntalking but rarely delivers.\nSince I was so committed to understanding the situation from their\nviewpoint, I became keenly aware of my company’s \u0000aws and the areas in which\nit needed to improve. To address these \u0000aws and demonstrate how we were\ngoing to correct them, I arrived at the meeting with a stack of data to bolster my\nargument. I had a ten-point plan prepared and ready to go. Six of those points\nwere about the other company, and four were about mine. As I suggested earlier,\nwhen you have a sit-down, you want to spend the majority of time focusing on\nthe other party’s concerns, not yours.\nI went into the room and said, “Listen, here’s what you want, based on what\nyou told me the last time we met. This is what makes you unhappy, and this is\nwhat we’re going to \u0000x. If we do what I’m proposing, you won’t have to hire\nadditional people. I’ve already made a call [to a supplier of systems], and I know\nyou’re interested in buying the system, and they’ll charge you a fee of $1 million.\nI give this company a lot of business, and I convinced them to waive the fee.”\nI was able to deliver the message with con\u0000dence and clarity because I had\nrehearsed it over and over.\n“Wait a second,” you may be thinking. “I thought you went in there to\nincrease your compensation. Why in the world do you start by telling them\nyou’re e\u0000ectively giving them a million dollars?”\nA simple rule of business is that in order to get, you have to give. Most\namateurs are experts at making demands. What they fail to do is o\u0000er value \u0000rst."

    "raw_text": "When you put yourself into the other party’s shoes and lead with how they will\nwin and make money, it will be natural for them to give you what you want.\nI then pitched them on providing us with a compensation increase based on\nthe data I had gathered—data that showed why the increase was warranted.\n“If you say no to it, no problem. I have another company that I think will give\nus what we want. Do you have any questions?”\nThey had many. We went back and forth for two and a half hours. In fact, I\nhad already heard their questions, objections, and challenges. How is this\npossible? Because I had role-played. Like a grand master CEO who is always\nseveral steps ahead, I was able to lead them to where I wanted them to be because\nI had anticipated their moves.\nIn The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, uttered the\nclassic line “I’m gonna make him an o\u0000er he can’t refuse.” In this case, the o\u0000er\nwas a win-win agreement that increased the value of both of our businesses.\nWith the data I presented, of course they couldn’t refuse. The key to my success?\nIt was the work I had done before the sit-down began.\nEﬀective Sales Are About Conviction and a\nTransference of Feeling\nEven though this chapter is about the Ma\u0000a, it wouldn’t be complete without\nsome wisdom from the legendary Zig Ziglar. Before he died in 2012 at age\neighty-six, he may have been the most in\u0000uential sales trainer in the world. He\ntold a powerful story about one of his cookware sales reps who was in a slump.\nWhen Zig asked him why he wasn’t selling, the salesman rattled o\u0000 a list of\nreasons: times were tough, and cookware was expensive. Zig then asked him if he\nowned a set of the cookware that he sold to others. The salesman said no. When\nZig asked why, the salesman told him that he couldn’t a\u0000ord it, especially since\nhe was in a slump.\nZig asked questions. He listened. He empathized. In his heart of hearts, Zig\nbelieved that the cookware was a worthwhile investment. After all, he owned it\nhimself. He understood that it was expensive, but he had internalized all its\n\f\nbene\u0000ts. As with any investment, there was an up-front cost. And as with any\nsmart investment, Zig truly believed that it more than paid for itself.\nZig listened to his salesman’s objections. And although there were valid\nreasons for the salesman not to buy the cookware he was trying to sell, Zig truly\nbelieved that this man’s life would be much better with it. After hearing him out\nand overcoming every single objection, the salesman eventually bought the\ncookware. It turned out to be the ultimate power move.\nDuring his next presentation to a potential customer, the salesman heard all\nthe usual excuses. As Zig had done with him a few days earlier, the salesman\nasked questions, listened, and empathized. The di\u0000erence, because he had\nbought the cookware himself, was that he believed so strongly in its value that he\nwould not let those people make a bad decision. He truly felt that they would be\nbetter o\u0000 with the cookware than with the money it cost.\nHe hadn’t learned any fancy sales tricks or manipulative tactics. He had\nsimply changed the way he felt. Sure enough, he made the sale that night and\nwent on to become one of the company’s top performers. Once he believed in\nthe product enough to buy it himself, his slump was over.\nI’ll leave it to Zig to tell you the moral of the story: “Have an absolute and\ntotal belief that what you’re selling is worth more than the price you ask for it.\nYour belief in your product should be so great that you ought to be using it.”\nRemember that the “gift of gab” is overrated. What’s underrated is\nconviction. Since emotion and belief are what truly sell, I hire people who\nbelieve in both themselves and the company. With that integrity, that passion to\nbe of service, they can get up in front of any audience, large or small, and talk to\nthem with conviction about what we do.\nSales should feel e\u0000ortless, like a natural extension of who you are. It should\nexcite you to talk about what you do. Estée Lauder, who cofounded the\ncosmetics company that made her the only woman on Time magazine’s list of\nthe twenty most in\u0000uential business titans of the twentieth century, once said, “I\nhave never worked a day in my life without selling. If I believe in something, I sell\nit, and I sell it hard.”\nDespite what some people would have you believe, no one is born a\nsalesperson. Stop trying to \u0000nd “naturals.” Rather than looking for salespeople,\n\f\nlook for people who believe in your vision and want to build relationships. They\nmay not be social butter\u0000ies. In fact, some of the most outgoing, magnetic, and\nin\u0000uential people I know are honest-to-goodness introverts.\nHaving in\u0000uence isn’t about “selling anything to anyone,” or convincing\npeople to act against their own best interest. Selling is about believing in\nyourself, believing in your business, and believing in the value you can o\u0000er to\nthe other person, whether a potential customer, a key vendor, or a major\nindustry \u0000gure. If you believe in what you’re selling, if you’re operating from\nyour heart and gut and not your head, if you believe in a win-win outcome for\nevery negotiation, if you believe deep down that you can be of service to that\nother person, then networking, negotiation, and sales will all become second\nnature to you.\nNegotiation Is About Leverage\nWhoever has more leverage in a negotiation should come out on top. However,\nit’s not always obvious who has the leverage. For one, as much as you prepare,\nyou can never know exactly everything that’s going on with the other party.\nUltimately, the important thing is to understand leverage and know how to gain\npower from that leverage.\nIf you use too much leverage and overplay your hand to maximize your pro\u0000t\nfrom a particular deal, you may win the battle but lose the war. The late\nAmarillo Slim, a gambling legend and 1972 World Series of Poker champion,\nsaid, “You can shear a sheep a hundred times, but you can skin it only once.”\nEven a hustler like Slim recognized that the key to a long career is treating people\nin such a way that they want to keep doing business with you. In any game, the\ngoal is not to make a score; it’s to build a partnership in which both parties make\nscores in perpetuity.\nEarly in my career, I rarely had leverage. What made me an e\u0000ective\nnegotiator was not pretending otherwise—in other words, I didn’t feel a need to\nblu\u0000. Instead, I would structure deals so that the other party could minimize its\nrisk, thereby making the deal much more enticing to them. In the short term, it\noften meant I was getting the worst of the deal. Because I was thinking several\n\f\nmoves ahead, however, I asked for deal points that would improve the deal if we\nhit certain markers, while still enriching the other party. Because I was viewed as\nbeing fair, I was able to build long-term partnerships.\nIn the early days of my agency, a guy named David came to me with a\nproposition for licensing his software. He asked me to negotiate with other\ninsurance companies on his behalf. He knew that the more people who used this\nproduct, the more it would ultimately make my business more e\u0000cient. Because\nhis software was best in class and something he knew I needed, he pushed the\nenvelope. In addition to asking for my help with other companies, he wanted me\nto pay $50,000 to license the software. Since the “retail” price was slightly more,\nhe pitched it to me as though he were doing me a favor.\nI thought David had a lot of nerve trying to sell me the product and leverage\nmy contacts in the business. But just as a grand master doesn’t tip o\u0000 his future\nmoves, I stayed quiet. The reality is that I did need the software, and given our\ncash position, I was happy to get a discount. Plus, even though David was\nseemingly asking me for a favor, it would also bene\u0000t my business if other\ncompanies used the same software we did. David pitched it as a win-win, and\nthere was plenty of validity to that claim. Truth be told, if all our partners\nadopted the software at that time, we knew we could signi\u0000cantly reduce\nprocessing time on contacts (you know how I feel about speed!) and signi\u0000cantly\nreduce our labor costs.\nThis is where understanding leverage comes in. For one, I didn’t share all my\nthoughts with David. It would only have hurt my leverage if he’d known what I\nwas thinking. And to David’s credit, he had pitched this so smartly that my own\npresident (at the time) told me it was a good opportunity. He may have been\npartially right, but I was still \u0000abbergasted. Sometimes in an organization, a top\nexecutive may not value the cash in the bank as much as the founder does. Fifty\ngrand might not have seemed like much to him, but he wasn’t the one writing\nthe check.\nI asked my colleague to set up a call with David. The call lasted only four\nminutes. I simply stated how I viewed David’s proposal. “Let me get this\nstraight,” I said. “You want me to use my credibility to negotiate on your behalf\nwith carriers, yet you still want to charge me \u0000fty grand for your software?” I\n\f\nstayed quiet for a few beats to let that sink in. Then I said, “That won’t happen\nunless you waive the entire fee. You can let my guy know if you’re comfortable\nwith that, and if you’re not, I understand. Do you have any questions?”\nAfter a \u0000ve-second pause, he said, “No.”\nYou might think that I was reckless for taking such a hard line. But because I\nhad followed my own rules of preparation, I had walked in his shoes to see the\ndeal from his perspective. In doing so, I saw how much he had to gain if I used\nall my contacts to negotiate on his behalf. I \u0000gured that he would be smart\nenough (know your opponents!) to think like a grand master and realize that\nwaiving the \u0000fty grand for me would mean nothing in the long run, since I\nwould be able to help him gain so many new clients. I used that as leverage and\nmade my request.\nHow did that power play turn out?\nI’ve shared enough of my failures with you by now that I can sit here with a\nsmile on my face and share that success.\nNot only did David accept my terms and waive the fee, but he also told the\nstory to his friend Greg, who runs a private equity \u0000rm. David told him I had\nwhat it took to compete in the marketplace. As a result, Greg invested $10\nmillion in our next round of funding.\nHow was all that possible?\nWhen you’re con\u0000dent about your delivery and you are committed to\ncoming through, you can push the envelope. If you don’t execute, you’re just\nanother arrogant loudmouth. The delivery on your promises is what gets you\nrespect in the marketplace.\nHow to Win: Let the Other Guy Think He\nWon\nIn business, you’re going to meet and work with an extraordinary range of\npeople. Some will be brilliant, some will be arrogant, some will be idiosyncratic,\nand some will be crazy. The ability to work e\u0000ectively with a range of individuals\n—customers, employees, business partners, investors—is crucial to success. A lot\n\f\nof that ability involves sizing up people quickly and learning how to forge solid\nworking relationships.\nThere’s a \u0000ne line between being crazy and brilliant, mad and madly\nsuccessful. In addition to John Gartner’s The Hypomanic Edge, I recommend A\nFirst-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental\nIllness by Nassir Ghaemi. These books will help you see the way many of the top\n1 percent of the 1 percent think di\u0000erently. Most are wired di\u0000erently, and you\nneed to understand that wiring to deal with them e\u0000ectively.\nYou’ll need to learn how to negotiate with these types of people. At \u0000rst\nyou’ll feel as though you’re in a room \u0000lled with narcissistic jerks who have no\nfeelings. You’ll still need to \u0000gure out a way to deal with them because they’re\nnot going to go away. And the odds are that if you’re reading this and you’re\nabsolutely determined to get to the highest level, you’re probably a little “o\u0000” as\nwell.\nI’m de\u0000nitely more than a little “o\u0000.” And because I want to be prepared to\nreach the level of the 1 percent of the 1 percent, I study anyone and anything\nthat can help me.\nIf you can step outside your ego, you’ll realize that you often win by letting\nothers also win. It also pays, at times, to let others think that your great ideas are\nactually theirs. Let’s shift from the Mob world to another pressure-packed\nworld, the hedge fund business, to see how it works.\nWhen young Darius was working at a hedge fund, his boss might as well have\nbeen John Gotti. He (we’ll call him Dale) had a big reputation and an even\nbigger ego. Darius would spend months researching ideas and looking for\narbitrage opportunities in the market. When he \u0000nally had an idea with\nimpeccable data to back it up, he would walk into Dale’s o\u0000ce and explain the\ninvestment from every angle. Both his research and his presentation would be\nOscar worthy. He was smart, well prepared, and convincing.\nInvariably, his boss would say no.\nIt drove Darius up a wall. He dissected his pitch from every angle and\ncouldn’t, for the life of him, see where he had gone wrong. He was so frustrated\nthat he almost quit. The truth is that Darius had a blind spot, and only because\nhe was determined to see it did he start searching for it. In a team investment"

Since Darius knew that the colleague had come up with many of\nthe ideas, he was amazed that they were presented as Dale’s.\nThat was his “Aha! moment.”\nThe next time Darius had an idea, he used a di\u0000erent approach. Instead of\nwalking into Dale’s o\u0000ce with recommendations, he walked in with questions.\nInstead of appearing con\u0000dent, he appeared confused. “Dale, I noticed that the\nyield curve is starting to \u0000atten.”\n“What’s your point?” Dale asked.\n“I also noticed that ten-year Treasuries are priced higher than their historical\naverage.”\n“That makes no sense,” Dale said.\n“I can’t \u0000gure it out, either,” the sheepish Darius replied. “It just seems like\nsomething is o\u0000.”\n“You bet your ass something is o\u0000. We need to short ten-year Treasuries.”\n“I guess you’re right. Not sure how I missed that.”\n“I am. I keep telling you young bucks that it takes thirty years to become an\novernight success. Now get out of here and short those ten years.”\nGiven what you now know about power plays, this (true) story ought to\nmake sense. Because Darius \u0000nally \u0000gured out how to think like a grand master,\nhe was able to make a series of moves—and ask a series of questions—that led\nDale to where Darius wanted him to go.\nThe Ma\u0000a is a fascinating organization. Though I don’t advocate much of what\nit does, I have learned important lessons from how it operates. Though we may\nlike to joke and say, “Make him an o\u0000er he can’t refuse,” I expect you to take this\nto a di\u0000erent level. By preparing like a mobster, you will understand the stakes of\nany meeting and do everything you can to succeed before the meeting even\nstarts. An o\u0000er that enriches both you and the other party—now, that’s an o\u0000er\nno one can refuse.\n\f\n15\nCultivate Your Power, and Stay\nBattle Tested\nIf a man is proud of his wealth, he should not be praised until it is known how he\nemploys it.\n—Socrates\nEverybody likes you until you’re a competitor, especially if you’re a formidable\none.

Once my company really\nstarted growing, enemies appeared from everywhere. People started blocking me\non social media. Rumors were spread; they called me Darth Bet-David. People in\nmy industry, as you now know, did everything they could to shut me down.\nStaying a successful entrepreneur, year after year, is the ultimate challenge.\nIn our \u0000nal chapter, I want you to learn even more about leverage. I want you\nto see how having options will change your mindset and ultimately take you to a\nplace of power. I want to show you that asking how you can help others before\nasking for something in return will shift every interaction you have.\nWe’re going to expand on many topics we’ve already covered. Since you need\npeople to scale your company—and you need ful\u0000lling relationships to enjoy\nyour life—we’re going to drill down and explain how you can guide people to\nbecoming their best. Don’t mistake “drive” as meaning you’re the one who is at\nthe wheel. Rather, you need to understand what drives people, recognize that it’s\ndi\u0000erent for everyone, and use your leadership to assist them in steering."

    "raw_text": "Real Power Is Having Options\nLeverage is such an important element of power that we need to dig deeper to\nunderstand it better. The person who really has the leverage is the person who\nneeds the deal the least. Options give you power. If you can walk away from a\ndeal, you’re in the best position to negotiate the best terms. If you must make a\ndeal happen, you’re going to be at the mercy of someone else’s power, and you’re\nprobably going to make a lousy deal.\nThat’s an obvious concept. The question is how to put it into practice. The\nshort answer is: whenever possible, cultivate multiple options. Instead of looking\nfor that one dream home (the same idea applies to a car, an o\u0000ce building, and a\nkey hire), survey the market and \u0000nd three options you would enjoy. Then when\nyou go to make a deal with your top choice, you’ll have the advantage, because\nyou’ll have other options that would also make you happy. If you sense that you\nare the seller’s only option, now you really have leverage.\nI know entrepreneurs who go after one big client, hoping it will solve all their\nproblems. They think that getting their product into Costco, Target, or Walmart\nwill mean they can stop prospecting. Maybe a deal like that will become your\nmagic bullet—for a month or maybe even a year or two. Eventually, though, that\nbig customer will use its leverage to take away your power.\nHow much mental anguish do you go through worrying about losing a key\ncustomer or a valued employee? Now look for your deepest why. The real reason\nis that you don’t know if you would survive if you lost the customer or\nemployee. As a result, you’ve already given away your power.\nI’m an adviser for Bobby’s company, which is doing $8 million in annual\nrevenue. On paper, his business looks great. There’s only one problem: $5\nmillion of his revenue comes from one customer. For a while, the customer was\nsatis\u0000ed and life was grand. Over time, though, the customer kept pushing for\nmore concessions. And why didn’t Bobby push back? Because he had no other\noptions. For all the talk of posturing and blu\u0000ng—which can have its place—\npeople know who has the power in a relationship. The customer kept asking for\nbetter and better terms, which came with an implied threat: if you don’t give us\nwhat we want, we’ll take our business elsewhere.\n\f\nWe’re all supposed to be grand masters in business by now. We should be able\nto come up with the perfect move to get Bobby out of this jam. That, in fact,\nwas what he asked me to do. The problem, however, was that the moves he had\nfailed to make years before had put him into that bind. When he had stopped\nprospecting, when he had stopped growing his business, when he had gotten\ncomplacent after landing this big customer, that was when his problems had\nbegun.\nI had an easy solution for Bobby. I told him to go get more options. His\nleverage was already gone. There was no move he could make, no posturing he\ncould do, to keep the big customer and make even a cent of pro\u0000t.\nHe, of course, didn’t want to hear it.\nBobby lost the customer and went from an $8 million to a $3 million\nbusiness overnight. As if that weren’t bad enough, he was forced to sell the\ncompany because it was unsustainable without his main customer. You know\nwho bought him? That’s right, his old customer, and it cut Bobby out of the\nbusiness right after making the acquisition. Because Bobby was playing like an\namateur, never thinking past one or two moves ahead, he got checkmated right\nout of business.\nThe moral of the story? The key to power is having options. If Bobby had\nspread his revenue over a larger group of customers, he wouldn’t have been so\nvulnerable. If he had grown to the point where the demand for his product\nexceeded his capacity to produce it, he could have been the one dictating the\nterms. The power would have shifted, giving Bobby the ability to raise prices or\ninsist on quicker payment terms.\nMaybe in your relationships you’ll get lucky and \u0000nd the perfect person and\nlive happily ever after, but in business, the perfect customer doesn’t exist, no\nmatter how beautiful or rich she may be. If 30 percent or more of your revenue\ncomes from one place, you’re in trouble. It doesn’t matter how much money\nyou’re making. When your revenue stream is concentrated in one customer, that\ncustomer is in control.\nGenerate options for yourself. This is true regarding customers as well as\ntalent. When you have plenty of both, you won’t have to worry constantly that\npeople are going to leave you. You can make yourself more attractive to anyone if\n\f\nyou keep yourself in good shape. In business, that means outworking,\noutimproving, outlasting, and outstrategizing your competitors.\nPlaying the Long-Term Game of Power:\nHumility and Service\nIn 2019, I gave a speech for a group of aspiring entrepreneurs at an event called\nDRIVEN in Long Beach, California. After I spoke, a guy came up to me while\nthere were forty people around us, \u0000ve cameras on us, and he started talking.\n“I’ve got to tell you, Pat, your content has changed my life. I mean, I’m not the\nsame human being.”\nI live for such moments. Hearing how my content has helped people is a\ntremendous source of pride for me. Just as I was enjoying the adulation, he\nhanded me a business card and said, “My name is Ritchie. If you ever want to\nbuy real estate in Vegas, give me a call.”\nI stopped him right there. “Let me ask you a question,” I said. “Do you know\nwhat you just did?”\n“What did I do?” he asked.\nLet’s pause for a second so you can think about what he did. In my view,\nwhat he did was the equivalent of walking up to a woman at a bar and saying,\n“Oh, my gosh, you look so good. Oh, my gosh, your hair. I can see you put time\ninto it. Your eyebrows. Perfect. Wow. You’re absolutely gorgeous. Listen, if you\never want to go to bed with me, here’s my card. Give me a call.”\nDoes that sound like a power move to you?\nI liked Ritchie. I appreciated the hustle. I just wanted him to see how his\nmethod was going to kill any chance of his building a long-term relationship\nwith me. Sure, a shotgun approach to business or dating will enable you to make\na sale every now and then if you play strictly a numbers game. Even amateurs\nwho only think one step ahead close the occasional deal.\nI asked him, “What do you want to do here with this relationship? Look at\nthe lens you’ve got on. Your only lens is to see what you want to get out of this.”\nWe chatted a bit more, and I sensed enough curiosity and humility in Ritchie\nto tell him a story.\n\f\nIn my early twenties, when I had just started selling insurance, I met a well-\nconnected guy named Eli. He was also Middle Eastern, and we had some mutual\nfriends. It wasn’t a business connection; he was more like a friend of the family.\nWe became buddies, and he invited me to his \u0000ftieth birthday party. The party\nwas at his house in an expensive suburb of LA. I arrived in my Ford Focus, and I\nsaw a bunch of nice cars parked near the house. I realized that the party could be\nan incredible networking opportunity. Even so, I kept a low pro\u0000le. I didn’t talk\nbusiness or hand out one business card. I even stayed and helped wash the\ndishes.\nEli and I built a friendship. As we got to know each other better, I asked him,\n“How can I help you? What can I do to make your life better?”\nEli got emotional and told me that his son had been in prison for nine years.\nNo one was visiting him because it was four hours away, near San Luis Obispo,\nand it was a rough prison. “If you’re willing to go,” Eli said, “it would mean the\nworld to me. I understand if you don’t want to, but that’d be a big favor that you\ncould do for me.”\nI said yes. Before going, I had to do a background check, \u0000ngerprints, the\nwhole nine yards. It took thirty days to get clearance. Once I did, I drove there\nand spent an entire day with Eli’s son. He was sitting in the corner and saying\nthings like “That guy just shanked that person. He was in the hole for this. That\nguy’s the king around here.” He was pointing out everyone and telling stories as\nthough we were old friends.\nWe became pen pals, writing letters back and forth. Not email, letters! I made\nthat four-hour drive several more times. After my \u0000rst visit, Eli called me and\nsaid, “You have no idea how important it was what you did for me.”\nI said, “Brother, anytime.”\nWe met for lunch at his house, and he asked, “How can I help you?”\nThat’s when I told Eli I was a \u0000nancial adviser and looking for clients.\nHe gave me a list of six hundred names and told me I could use his name\nwhen I called them.\nAt that point in my career, I had experienced the di\u0000erence between cold calls\n(mostly hang-ups) and introductions (which often led to meetings)."

I\nsaid to him, “See, if I would’ve gone to him on day one and said, ‘Can you get\nme some leads for clients?,’ can you imagine what would’ve happened? He\nwould’ve said no.”\nPower plays are all about the long game. Why do you think we’ve been talking\nso much about chess masters? If you want referrals, if you want to build long-\nterm relationships, the next time you meet anyone (much less a key in\u0000uencer),\ndon’t go up to him or her and say, “Do you want to go to bed with me? Can you\ngive me what I want?”\nThe power move is to \u0000ip it and instead ask, “What can I do for you? How\ncan I help you?” It’s a life-changing move that requires a complete shift in\nmindset. Not only will you build better relationships, but also, if you are truly\ncommitted to the long game, it will make you a boatload of money.\nThe Formula for Gaining Power\nOutwork. It’s critical to put in the time. But hard work alone won’t be enough.\nOutimprove. This constantly gives you new ways to take your business to the next level. It gives\nyou con\u0000dence. If there was an area I was always obsessed with competing in, it was improving\nfaster than my peers.\nOutstrategize. This means thinking \u0000ve moves ahead. It means \u0000guring out how to scale and\nhaving the patience to plan many moves ahead before they bear fruit.\nOutlast. You really learn about people both when you achieve great success and when you su\u0000er\ntragic failure. It’s hard to know who will keep going. To outlast, you need endurance, which\ncomes from making choices that keep you alert and focused on the game.\nShadow Who You Want to Be\nNow we’re bringing things full circle. The \u0000rst move was for you to \u0000gure out\nwho you want to be. The power play for becoming who you want to be is\n\u0000nding someone who is already experiencing that success.\nWarren Bu\u0000ett enjoyed the good fortune of having Benjamin Graham as his\nprofessor at Columbia University.

    "raw_text": "Intelligent Investor: The Deﬁnitive Book on Value Investing and is regarded as the\nfather of value investing. Having a front-row seat to one of the greatest minds in\ninvesting played a massive role in Bu\u0000ett’s success. Bu\u0000ett so badly wanted to\nshadow Graham after business school that he was willing to work for him for\nfree. Graham didn’t o\u0000er him a job, and Bu\u0000ett went back to his hometown of\nOmaha, Nebraska. Graham later hired him, and Bu\u0000ett said, “I took a job with\nBen Graham, my hero. I never asked the salary. I found out at the end of the\nmonth when I got my \u0000rst paycheck what I was earning.”\nPhysical proximity is what di\u0000erentiates shadowing from \u0000nding a mentor,\nwhich we discussed in chapter 12. If you can \u0000nd a person who will let you\nobserve him up close, take advantage of the opportunity. There’s a big di\u0000erence\nbetween having a mentor and shadowing someone. A mentor may tell you what\nto do, but a performer you shadow shows you what to do. You get to observe\n\u0000rsthand what he does during con\u0000ict and intense negotiations. You can also\nlearn how he handles enemies and how he motivates his team.\nI can’t emphasize enough the power of surrounding yourself with other\npeople who are living your dream life. The key point to remember is that you\nwant to shadow successful people no matter where you are in your career. At\nevery stage of my growth, I’ve attached myself to the people I admire. As a kid, I\ntried to go everywhere with my dad. In the army, I stayed close to the best\nleaders. I also worked out with the strongest guys. As a salesman at Bally, I\nshadowed Francisco Davis because he was the top salesman. I didn’t care how\nlate it was or what type of menial tasks I had to perform. It was worth staying\nlate to have a ten-minute conversation with Francisco or even just be in the room\nwhen he made his follow-up calls. All I was looking for was how to feed my mind\nand see things I could do better.\nSuccessful people are busy, so you have to oﬀer them value. It can’t hurt to\no\u0000er to buy them co\u0000ee or lunch, but it’s even better to do something that\nimproves their business. Volunteer to edit their proposals or do research. O\u0000er\nto stay late and write their thank-you notes while you listen to them make sales\ncalls. You might be surprised what you may have to o\u0000er. Especially if you are\nunder thirty, you probably know more about social media than just about\neveryone over forty does. O\u0000er to help them set up their social media pages for\n\f\ntheir business. Ideally, the relationship will become a win-win. You get to learn\nfrom being in the other person’s presence, and he or she bene\u0000ts from your skills\nand willingness to work.\nOne last example is NBA coach Steve Kerr. Yes, him again, the same guy who\nmade Andre Iguodala feel needed on Golden State’s way to an NBA\nchampionship. In his \u0000rst \u0000ve seasons as a head coach, Kerr led the Warriors to\nthe NBA \u0000nals every single year and won three championships. After \u0000ve\ngrueling seasons, including the last one in which he witnessed Klay Thompson,\nKevin Durant, and DeMarcus Cousins sustain awful injuries (and the latter two\nleave the team via free agency), you might think that he would have spent the\nsummer of 2019 getting some well-deserved rest.\nIn the summer of 2019, Team USA was preparing for the FIBA World Cup.\nI’m a huge basketball fan, and I couldn’t even tell you what FIBA stands for.\nThere’s no glory, no Olympic medal, and little recognition to be had from\ncoaching the team. In fact, so many NBA stars refused to play that there was\nonly a handful of All-Stars on the roster. But since Gregg Popovich, arguably the\nNBA’s best coach, was the head coach, Steve Kerr put his vacation aside in order\nto be an assistant to Popovich. He couldn’t resist the opportunity to shadow\ngreatness.\n“This is an incredible opportunity and one I’m extremely grateful for,” Kerr\nsaid. “I had the good fortune to participate in our USA Basketball program as an\namateur, and to have the chance to return to the world stage three decades later\nand work under Pop, one of my former coaches and a mentor, is a tremendous\nhonor.”\nIf you want to gain power, you must create opportunities to shadow others.\nIf you want to be exceptional, even after winning championships, you must\njump on every opportunity you can to shadow powerful leaders.\nLeadership Is Knowing What Drives People\n\f\nIn this, our \u0000nal chapter, we keep coming back to ideas we’ve already looked at\nand are now taking to the next level. In chapter 2, we talked about knowing\nwhat drives you. Now we’re going to examine what motivates others. We\ntouched on some of these things when discussing the Nine Love Languages of\nEntrepreneurs, but this is next level.\nWhen I was twenty-two years old, working at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as\nan adviser, I spoke to two audiences in a span of a month. The \u0000rst was a group\nof seniors who wanted to learn about better alternatives for retirement. I spent\nthe majority of my time speaking to them about what it would feel like to be able\nto live in a 10,000-square-foot home with a Ferrari parked outside and an Amex\nblack card in their wallet. They looked at me as if I had lost it—until they\nstopped paying attention altogether.\nA couple of weeks later, I spoke to a group of salespeople who were in their\nlate twenties to early thirties and decided to take a completely di\u0000erent\napproach. I asked them to think about what it would feel like to one day be able\nto send their kids and grandkids to the best universities without worrying about\nhow much it would cost. Or having enough money in a retirement account to\ndraw $10,000 a month for the rest of their lives, while living comfortably near a\ngolf course. Again, I lost them all.\nAt the time, I had a manager who was trying to motivate me. All she talked\nabout were the things that moved her. As you can imagine, she lost me. When I\nre\u0000ected, it made me realize why I had lost both audiences. Just as she didn’t\nspeak to what drove me, I hadn’t spoken to what drove each audience.\nThe ultimate power move is getting the most out of people. It’s also the move\nthat will—now I’m speaking for myself—bring the most ful\u0000llment. Seeing\npeople \u0000nally get the light to turn on and succeed is what I live for most. It’s also\nthe reason this book is in your hands.\nA great leader is someone who sets a great example and earns moral authority.\nA great leader is someone who is able to get others to do things they wouldn’t do\non their own. There are many people out there who set a great example yet still\nstruggle with why their team doesn’t follow their example. Setting an example\nalone is not enough. Great leaders eventually learn how to drive people to their\nown standard of excellence. This isn’t an easy task, which makes it a high-paying"

    "raw_text": "skill. Anyone who learns how to move people has a skill set that’s transferable to\nany industry.\nAgain, let’s look at the four areas that drive people. Then we’ll speak\nspeci\u0000cally about how to lead those who are driven by each category.\nAdvancement. People driven by this see reaching new heights as the best form of\nmotivation. Constantly have the next goal or position set up for them to keep moving up, or\nthey’ll get bored.\nIndividuality. The language to speak to this group is what their future life can look like if\nthey give everything they have: cars, prestige, going to the best restaurants, traveling,\nassociating with celebrities, and so on. As long as they know that the lifestyle they’re\nmotivated by can eventually be reached by working with you, they’ll do their part to help\ngrow the company.\nMadness. People driven by this see unconventional factors as the best form of motivation.\nThey are driven by having an enemy, by facing an opponent. They will be bored out of their\nminds if you don’t constantly \u0000nd them a new enemy or target to reach.\nPurpose. People driven by this want to be part of something bigger than they are, but they\nalso want the history books to write about them (in the company’s history books or in\nindustry papers). This group may be the smallest of the bunch, but if you’re lucky enough to\nattract one to your organization, get ready to experience a massive explosion.\n\f\nUnderstand, Position, and Lead—but Do Not\nTry to Fix\nNo matter whom you are managing, remember that the fastest way to lose them\nor frustrate them is to try to change them. I’ve made this mistake too many times\nin my career. Instead, \u0000nd what drives them and position them in a way to win\nat the highest level. It may require you to change the lens through which you\nview them.\nStop trying to \u0000x people. Thinking you can change or \u0000x people is delusional\nbehavior. When I started in business, I was guilty of this all the time. I pushed\npeople hard when they were coming up short, because I assumed that that was\nwhat they wanted. I \u0000gured that if they were messing up, they’d appreciate my\nfeedback, harsh as it might have been, and would change and become the\nperformers I needed them to be.\nThis is delusional. I realized that I couldn’t change people; they had to\npossess the inner drive to \u0000x their own mistakes. Once I realized that, I began to\nmanage people more e\u0000ectively. I stopped trying to solve other people’s\nproblems. Instead, I realized that what they wanted is someone to listen to them,\nsomeone to ask them questions, someone to nudge them in the right direction.\nPeople want to be heard. Taking the time to understand them is critical for\ne\u0000ective leadership. After that, if they possess an inner drive to excel, they’ll self-\ncorrect. They’ll do their part in achieving their best.\nBy digging deeper into power plays, we now have a di\u0000erent lens through which\nto view all human interactions. Whether it’s leverage in a negotiation or your\n\u0000rst meeting with an in\u0000uencer, taking the time to see where the power lies—\nand acting accordingly—is what will make you a grand master. If you want to\ndevelop this ability, the most powerful move you can make is to shadow great\nleaders. Whatever the situation, do your best to be around people who have the\nskills and success that you are seeking.\nLast, keep that chart of what drives people close by. Remember that everyone\nis motivated by di\u0000erent things and that your job as a leader is not to drive them\n\f\n(or, worse, \u0000x them), it’s to understand them and help align the chess pieces in\nfront of them so they can maximize their potential."

Before your next meeting, go through all seven steps\nof preparation. In every negotiation, be aware of who has leverage. Don’t\novernegotiate when you’re lacking it, and don’t bully when you have it, especially\nif you view the other person as a long-term strategic partner.\nCULTIVATE YOUR POWER, AND STAY BATTLE TESTED\n3. Constantly study leverage.

Also, shift your approach to \u0000nding ways to\nhelp others rather than using a shotgun approach to getting business. Lastly,\nvalue people so deeply that you are constantly looking to see what drives them\nand how you can help steer them based on their motivations.\n\f\nConclusion\nCheckmate\nAs someone who didn’t \u0000nish school, I think it’s so important to become a lifelong\nlearner and embrace an endless curiosity about the world.\n—Richard Branson\nWe’ve come a long way together. If you’re not a sports fan, you may have heard\none too many sports analogies. I share what I know, and I can’t help but keep\n\u0000nding parallels between business and sports. So please indulge me one last time,\nbecause there was a man named Andrew Bynum who was once to basketball\nwhat Magnus Carlsen is to chess. I know that may sound as though I’m giving\nBynum too much credit, but stay with me.\nBynum was blessed with unworldly talent. In 2005, when he was only\nseventeen, he was the \u0000rst-round pick of my beloved Los Angeles Lakers. The\nlate, great Kobe Bryant was still in his prime, and I couldn’t wait for that seven-\nfoot behemoth to dominate the NBA. On paper, Bynum had the raw talent to\nbe as good as Shaquille O’Neal. On the court, he showed \u0000ashes of one day\nbeing a Hall of Famer.\nBynum started out as a damn good basketball player. He helped the Lakers\nwin NBA titles in 2009 and 2010. In 2012, before he turned twenty-\u0000ve, he was\nselected All-NBA. He seemed on course to win more championships and be a\n\u0000xture on All-NBA teams.\nThen it all went straight to hell."

    "raw_text": "He had some injuries, and he was traded to the 76ers. He bounced around\nthe league, and then, in 2013, while playing for the Cavaliers, he was suspended.\nThe reason was disturbing: during a practice, he shot the ball every time he\ntouched it, no matter where he was on the court. I didn’t just see that as a middle\n\u0000nger to his coaches and teammates; I saw it as complete disrespect for the game\nof basketball. Never mind the championships, the accolades, the tens of millions\nof dollars; at age twenty-six, Bynum had completely ruined his career and\ndisgraced the game of basketball.\nWhy?\nI’ve never met Bynum, so I can only speculate. The way I see it, the reason\nBynum underachieved is that he did not love the game. How could he respect\nsomething that he never loved?\nSometimes it’s tough to love something that comes too easily. You see this in\nbusiness all the time. You often see it in children of wealthy families who have\nbeen given a big inheritance. When the struggle is removed from life—when we\ndidn’t have to earn it—people start to feel entitled and take things for granted.\nIt’s one of the laws of human nature.\nWhy am I talking so much about Andrew Bynum? Because the number one\nfactor in reaching your potential is simple: It must matter to you. History books\nare \u0000lled with individuals who did impossible things simply because it mattered\nto them. I hope that something tugs at Bynum’s heart to the point where he’d be\nwilling to give his best.\nYou have to want success. You have to want it so badly that it hurts.\nPersistence, dedication, drive—these are traits that all elite people from athletes\nto chess masters to CEOs have. I know I keep reminding you how hard it is,\nbecause I know that you’re going to need another gear to take your talent to the\nhighest level imaginable.\nLeveling Up Means Starting Over at the Bottom\nTo reach your capacity, you’re going to have to “compete up” and not be afraid.\nSeek to beat your prior best in all areas.

    "raw_text": "The king of grade school becomes low man on the totem pole the day he goes\nto middle school. When he \u0000nally climbs back up to the top of the ladder, high\nschool starts and he’s back at the bottom again. Your career is going to feel\nsimilar: each time you advance, you’ll o\u0000cially be at the bottom of the next level.\nOne of the biggest fears that holds people back from moving up is that they\nwon’t get respect. Let’s look at this chart to see what I mean.\nThe key to getting in the 1 percent is continually investing in learning and\ngrowth. Large corporations invest in their talent. They groom promising junior\nemployees for leadership, sending them for expensive training and assigning\nthem experienced mentors. If you don’t have the luxury of a large corporation\ninvesting in your talent, you must still \u0000nd ways to invest in yourself.\nFor some reason, most of us think we’re afraid of challenges. But when we’re\nnot being challenged, we get bored. Then we stagnate. If we aren’t challenged,\nwe also often don’t realize what’s inside of us and how much we are capable of\naccomplishing. Any entrepreneur who wants to stay sane needs to let go of the\nsilly notion that challenges are scary. Challenges never stop coming, so you’d\nbetter learn to love them and thrive on them. Every struggle is an opportunity to\ngrow and improve.\nEvery move up will make you feel as though you’re in over your head. You\nwill be tested. Again, what will determine your success is if it matters to you.\n\f\nUse Entrepreneurship to Solve the World’s Problems\nI’ve said countless times that many of the world’s problems are going to be\nsolved by entrepreneurs. The simple reason is that entrepreneurs are problem\nsolvers. They look at something complex, study it, simplify it, and ultimately\n\u0000nd a way to solve it. Entrepreneurs can solve health, economic, environmental,\nand educational challenges.\nOften, the \u0000rst motivation for somebody who’s never been an entrepreneur\nto become one is to make a lot of money so he or she can have a bigger house, a\nbigger car, and other toys. There’s nothing wrong with that. But your mission\nhas to be bigger. Know that the world today is counting on us to solve big\nproblems that will never stop coming.\nThe game of business can be ugly at times. The start-up graveyard is \u0000lled\nwith companies run by well-intentioned, talented people who just weren’t\nprepared to handle the chaos of building a business. If you can take being\npushed to your limits, beaten down by Goliath, and ostracized by friends and\nstill stay true to your mission, it will be worth it. I don’t mean that eventually it\nwill be worth it; I mean that every day you \u0000ght for something, every day you live\naccording to your future truth, every day you guide people to be their best, you\nwill feel the rewards.\nThe world needs you. It needs your ideas, your passion, and your heart.\nYou have all the information needed to master the \u0000ve key moves:\nhow to know yourself\nhow to reason\nhow to build your team\nhow to use strategy to scale\nhow to make power plays\nAll the questions, all the tools, all the stories are there to help you. But\nultimately, you’re going to bene\u0000t only if you apply what you’ve learned in this\nbook. It’s now time to identify your next moves.\nAt a minimum, list \u0000ve. If you aspire to think like a grand master, challenge\nyourself to list \u0000fteen. As you’re doing so, consider the concept of sequencing.\nYou may be tempted to make move \u0000fteen your third move. Instead, focus on\n\f\nthe bigger picture. Remember, it’s the moves in the right sequence that will\nmake you a grand master. That’s how you end up winning in the war room,\nboardroom, and bedroom.\n\f\n\n\f\nAPPENDIX A\nPERSONAL IDENTITY AUDIT\n\f\nPERSONAL IDENTITY AUDIT\n1. How do you think the world views you?\n2.

    "raw_text": "Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values That We Learned as Children (but\nMay Have Forgotten) by Jon M. Huntsman\nFor more content, visit the Valuetainment YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/valuetainment\n\f\nAcknowledgments\nPatrick Bet-David\nSince I’m a by-product of six major things in my life, I’ll use six categories to\nthank everything and everyone for whom I am thankful.\nGenes. It all started with my parents, Gabreal Bet-David and Diana\nBoghosian. I wouldn’t be who I am without them.\nCulture. I have to thank \u0000ve cultures that have made me who I am today.\nI’m half Armenian, half Assyrian, and I lived in Tehran, Iran, for ten years before\nseeking asylum in Erlangen, Germany, and eventually ending up in the United\nStates. Each of those cultures has had a major in\u0000uence on the way I view life.\nExperiences. They say great actors are those who have lived a life with many\ndi\u0000erent experiences \u0000lled with both pain and joy. I have to say that the same\napplies to the world of business. I’m grateful for every single event that’s\nhappened in my life, even though I didn’t appreciate all of them while they were\nhappening. I wouldn’t be who I am today without having lived through a war in\nIran, having lived in a refugee camp, or having served in the army. All of those\nexperiences and more have made me who I am today.\nChoices. I’ve made many bad choices and a few good ones. Some felt like\ngreat choices at \u0000rst until I realized they weren’t, and some felt like bad choices\nthat turned out okay. All of them have taught me lessons that I cherish today.\nSome cost me money, some cost me relationships, some made me money, some\nhelped me build relationships. All of them helped me become who I am today.\nPeople. This also falls into a few categories. I have to start o\u0000 by thanking\nmy wife, Jennifer, who has had my back since day one. My life changed the day I\n\f\nmet her. She gave birth to our three children, Patrick, Dylan, and Senna, each of\nwhom has changed my life in his or her own unique way.\nI have to thank my \u0000rst best friend, my older sister, Polet Bet-David. Her\nhusband, Siamak Sabetimani, became the brother I never had. Before I had my\nown three kids, I fell in love with theirs, Grace and Sean Sabetimani.\nI’m immensely grateful for the leadership team of PHP Agency who bought\ninto the vision I cast when all the odds were against us. There’s no way in the\nworld we could have built an agency of \u0000fteen thousand insurance agents\nwithout the heart, focus, and talent of our leadership team: Sheena and Matt\nSapaula, Jose and Marlene Gaytan, and many others.\nFinding a Running Mate is tough, but Mario Aguilar has been exactly that\non many projects, including helping to put together the content of this book.\nThis book would have never happened without my agent, Scott Ho\u0000man.\nI also have to thank my collaborator, Greg Dinkin, who helped bring\nstructure and organization to my ideas and experiences. A special thanks to those\nwho helped organize my thoughts when we were stuck on an idea or a chapter of\nthe book: Maral Keshishian, Tigran Bekian, Tom Ellsworth, David Moldawer,\nand Kai Lode.\nI’m grateful to the publisher, Jennifer Bergstrom, and our brilliant editors,\nKaryn Marcus and Rebecca Strobel. Much thanks to Lynn Anderson and Eric\nRaymer for their incredible attention to detail.\nI wouldn’t be writing this book or creating new content if it weren’t for the\nmillions of Valuetainers and entrepreneurs who follow the content on a monthly\nbasis. I’m grateful for you. You energize me in ways that words can’t describe.\nToo often we recognize those who loved us and supported us and we forget\nthose who were our competitors, haters, or critics. Those who have doubted me\nhave a special place in my heart. I was tempted to list their names, but I would\nneed several pages to list them all. Just know that I love you and I’m extremely\nthankful for you.\nInspiration. Last but not least, there’ve been a handful of moments when I\nwas inspired to do something big with my life. I felt as though several experiences\nkept pulling me in, even though initially I didn’t want to commit to them. Now\nthat I look back, I’m glad I chose to commit and give my best. Such moments of"

    "raw_text": "inspiration are why I feel that my tank is always full and why I’m excited to get\nup every morning to ful\u0000ll the next vision that I’m creating.\nGreg Dinkin (Collaborator)\nYou may be wondering, as I was when I \u0000rst met Pat: Is this guy for real? As a\npoker champion and author of The Poker MBA, I have a \u0000nely tuned BS meter.\nI’m constantly looking to catch people in a blu\u0000 and test their authenticity.\nIn May 2019, a month after I started working with Pat, I attended the Vault\nconference in Dallas. At his opening strategy session, Pat \u0000elded questions from\ndozens of the attendees. In doing so, he would remember speci\u0000c details about\ntheir businesses. “Oh, yeah,” he would say. “We talked two years ago about your\ncomp plan. Have you been tracking it?” Or “I remember our email exchange\nabout how you need to invest more in analytics. Have you pulled the trigger yet?\nNo? Why not?”\nI was astounded by his memory and even more impressed with his business\nacumen. Then it dawned on me that he had been mentoring dozens of\nentrepreneurs—for free, simply from his heartfelt desire to give back—while\nrunning his business, raising three kids, and expanding his knowledge base (I’ve\nnever met anyone who reads more and works harder on himself).\nAny doubt I had about Pat being in it—making videos for Valuetainment,\ngiving workshops, and writing this book—for the right reasons was erased. As I\nwitnessed that night and continued to see for the next year, Pat is as genuine,\nauthentic, and caring as they come.\nIf I had to boil down his success to one characteristic, it’s that he cares deeply\nabout people accomplishing their dreams. As much as we did our best to include\nevery ounce of Pat’s knowledge on the page, it would be impossible to express his\nlove and commitment to people—and why it’s the secret sauce that makes him,\nat least in my view, one of the greatest living leaders on the planet.\nImagine a person who takes the time to truly get to know you, who asks\nquestions to help you uncover exactly who you want to be—often leading you\nto remember and express your wildest ambition. Then imagine him supporting\nyou with resources and coaching, while at the same time holding you\n\f\naccountable to being the best version of yourself at a level you may not even\nknow you can attain. Then imagine seeing him demand even more of himself\nthan he’s demanding of you. How could you not reach great heights? It’s no\naccident that Pat has taken dozens of people without college degrees and molded\nthem into millionaires. Love matters, for sure. Combine it with accountability,\nleadership, and an example to follow, and incredible success follows.\nI feel lucky to have had a front-row seat to observe such an impressive human\nbeing. Imagine being a basketball player and getting to shadow LeBron James for\na year. If it seems as though I’m laying it on thick, it’s because I’m over\u0000owing\nwith gratitude. This started out as just a writing project for me, and it ended up\nbecoming a PhD program in unleashing human potential. As a result, I’ve\nbecome both a better coach/leader and a better version of myself. Seeing how\nmany people are already bene\u0000ting from Pat’s knowledge was a great motivator\nto help give you every bit of wisdom from Pat’s toolbox.\nIn addition to my thanks to Pat, I want to thank Mario Aguilar for being the\nconsummate professional. The ultimate consigliere, he was a huge asset at every\nstage of this process. I’m grateful for savant agent Scott Ho\u0000man for following\nhis instinct that Pat and I would be a good match. I also appreciate the support\nof my family and friends. Mom, Dad, Andy, Jayme, Leslie, Drew, Logan, Thea,\nMichelle, Cully, Josh, Bryan, Paul, Charlie, Mark, Monique, George, Chris,\nStuckey, and Frank each contributed in his or her own unique way.\n\f\nAbout the Author\nPatrick Bet-David went from escaping war-torn Iran to founding his own\n\u0000nancial \u0000rm, raising tens of millions of dollars, and creating Valuetainment, the\nleading YouTube channel for entrepreneurs. His unorthodox approach to\nbusiness and life has created compelling interviews with Ray Dalio, Kevin Hart,\nthe late Kobe Bryant, President George W. Bush, and a host of other luminaries.\nHis content on social media has been viewed over a billion times.\nPatrick never obtained a college degree and went from the army to selling\nhealth club memberships before selling \u0000nancial services. At age thirty, Bet-\nDavid founded PHP, a \u0000nancial services agency. He lives in Dallas with his wife\nand three children.\nFOR MORE ON THIS AUTHOR:\nSimonandSchuster.com/Authors/Patrick-Bet-David"
