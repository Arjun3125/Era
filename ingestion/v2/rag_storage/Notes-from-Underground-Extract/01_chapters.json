    "raw_text": "Both the author of  these “Notes” and the notes them­\nselves are, of  course, fictitious. All the same, people like \nthe author of  these notes not only can, but indeed must, \nexist in our society, given the circumstances in which our \nsociety was formed. I wanted to present to the public, with \nrather more prominence than usual, a character of  recent \ntimes – a representative of  a generation which is still with \nus. In this first extract, entitled “Under the Floorboards”, \nthis person describes himself  and his views and wants, as it \nwere, to explain the reasons why such an individual made \nan appearance – and had to make an appearance – in our \nmidst. The second extract will contain actual “notes” about \ncertain events in his life.\n– Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\f\n\n\f\n\u0018\n1\nI\n’m  a  sick  man … a spiteful man… an unattractive man, that’s what \nI am. I suspect there’s something wrong with my liver. But I don’t \nunderstand a damn thing about my illness, nor do I know for sure what’s \nwrong with me. I’m not being treated for anything and never have been, \nthough I respect doctors and medical science. Besides, I’m extremely \nsuperstitious, at least enough to have respect for medicine. (I’m suf-\nficiently educated not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious.) It’s \nbecause I’m spiteful that I don’t want to have any treatment. Now that’s \nsomething you’re probably not inclined to understand. Alright, but I \ndo understand it. I couldn’t of course explain to you who it is that I will \nactually hurt by my spite; I know perfectly well that I would be quite \nunable to foul things up for the doctors by not being treated by them; I’m \naware, no one more so, that all this will harm only myself and nobody \nelse. All the same, if I’m not being treated, it’s entirely out of spite. \nThere’s something wrong with my liver – well, let it get worse!\nI’ve been living like this for a long time – about twenty years. I’m \nforty now . I used to work in the Civil Service, but I don’t any more. \nI was a spiteful civil servant. I was rude and took pleasure in being \nrude. I never accepted bribes, you know , so I had to find some other \nreward even if it was only that. (A bad joke. But I won’t cross it out. \nI wrote it because I thought it would be very witty . Now that I see I \nwanted to show off horribly , I deliberately won’t cross it out.) When, \noccasionally , people came up to my table to ask for information, I used \nto snarl at them and was delighted every time I succeeded in upsetting \nthem. I almost invariably succeeded. For the most part they were timid \npeople. Of course – they were petitioners. Among the swankier lot, \nthere was one army officer I particularly detested. He simply refused to \ndo what he was told and rattled his sword in a disgusting way . I waged \nwar on him about that sword for a year and a half and got the better of \nhim in the end. He stopped rattling.\nAnyway , that happened when I was young. But do you know , \ngentlemen, the real point about my spite – that is, the essence of it,\n\f\nnotes  from  underground\n8\nthe most revolting aspect of it? It was that I was shamefully aware, \neven at my most bilious, that I was not only not a spiteful, or even an \nembittered man, but was merely frightening sparrows to no purpose \nand doing it just for fun. I might be foaming at the mouth – but you \nbring me some little toy , give me a cup of tea with a touch of sugar \nin it, and I’ll calm down, even be deeply touched – though later I’ll \nprobably be snarling at myself and, out of shame, suffering insomnia \nfor months. That’s the way I behave, after all.\nI lied when I said just now that I was a spiteful civil servant. I lied \nout of spite. I was simply indulging myself with the petitioners and the \narmy officer. I could never really become spiteful – I constantly sensed \nin myself a great many elements working in the opposite direction. I \nfelt they were just swarming inside me, these opposing elements, and \nI knew that they had been swarming inside me all my life and were \ninsisting on being let out. But I wouldn’t let them out – wouldn’t let \nthem, would not let them out quite deliberately . They tormented me to \nthe point of making me ashamed of myself, having convulsions, till I \ngot tired of them in the end – goodness, how tired! Doesn’t it seem to \nyou, gentlemen, that I’m apologizing to you for something, that I’m \nasking you to forgive me for something?… I’m sure that’s what it seems \nlike to you… But as a matter of fact, I promise you, I couldn’t care less \neven if it does.\nI have failed not only to become spiteful – but to become anything \nelse for that matter: vicious or kind, scoundrel or honest man, hero or \ninsect. And now I am living out my days in my corner, taunting myself \nwith the vicious and useless consolation that an intelligent man of the \nnineteenth century can’t seriously make himself into anything and that \nonly a fool can succeed in making himself into something. Y es, sir, an \nintelligent man of the nineteenth century must be – indeed is morally \nbound to be – essentially a creature without character. A man with \ncharacter, a public figure, must essentially be a limited creature. This is \nmy conviction of forty years. I am now forty years old. Forty years is a \nwhole life. It is extreme old age. It is indecent to live beyond this, vulgar \nand immoral. Who lives beyond forty? Answer me sincerely , honestly . \nI’ll tell you who lives beyond forty . Fools and scoundrels do. I’ll say this \nto all those venerable elders, to their face! I’ll say it to all those silver-\nhaired sweet-smelling elders, yes – to the face of the whole world I’ll \nsay it! I have a full right to say it because I myself will live to sixty . I’ll"

    "raw_text": "par t  one  · chapter  1\n9\nlive to seventy! I’ll live to eighty years old… Hang on a minute. Let me \ncatch my breath.\nGentlemen, you probably think I’m trying to make you laugh. Y ou’re \nwrong there too. I’m not at all the sort of jolly fellow you think I am – or \nas perhaps you think I am. Anyway , if all this chatter irritates you – and \nI feel that by now you are irritated – then just ask me who in fact I am. \nI will answer: I was a very minor clerk in the Civil Service, a collegiate \nassessor. I used to work in order to eat (and for that reason alone) and \nwhen, last year, a distant relative of mine left me six thousand roubles in \nhis will, I retired immediately and settled into my corner. I used to live \nin that corner before, but now I’ve settled down in it. It’s a rotten room, \nmine – nasty , on the outskirts of town. My servant is an old peasant \nwoman, spiteful because she’s stupid, and what’s more she always \nsmells. They tell me that the Petersburg climate is doing me no good \nand that, for someone of negligible means, life in Petersburg is very \nexpensive. I know all that, know it better than all those sagacious and \nexperienced counsellors and wiseacres. But I’m staying in Petersburg; I \nwon’t leave Petersburg! I won’t leave it because… Ah! It doesn’t matter \nat all whether I leave it – or don’t.\nAnyway\n, what can an honest man talk about with the greatest pos-\nsible pleasure?\nAnswer: about himself.\nSo I too will talk about myself.\n2\nN\now  i  want  to  tell  you , gentlemen, whether you want to hear it or \nnot, why I couldn’t even manage to make myself into an insect. \nI tell you solemnly that I often wanted to become an insect but didn’t \nmanage even that. I swear to you, gentlemen, that to be too much aware \nof things is an illness, a real, genuine illness. For ordinary purposes it \nwould be quite enough for people to have half, or even a quarter, of the \nawareness that falls to the lot of an educated individual in our wretched \nnineteenth century – an individual, what’s more, with the additional \nmisfortune of living in Petersburg, the most abstract and premeditated \ncity on the globe. (There are premeditated and unpremeditated cit-\nies.) It would for instance be quite enough to be as aware as so-called\n\f\nnotes  from  underground\n10\nspontaneous and decisive people. I bet you think I’m writing all this in \norder to boast or to make fun of decisive people and that I’m boasting \nin bad taste too, rattling my sword like my officer. But, gentlemen, who \nwants to admit his own infirmities, let alone boast and glory in them?\nBut why just me… everyone does it; everyone shows off their \ninfirmities and I possibly more than anyone else. Don’t let’s argue; my \npoint is absurd. But, in spite of it, I’m firmly convinced that not just \nexcessive awareness, but any awareness at all, is in itself an illness. I \ninsist on that. Let’s put it aside for a minute. Tell me this: why did it \nsometimes happen that just at the moment – yes, at the very moment \n– at which I was most capable of appreciating all the fine points of \neverything “beautiful and sublime”,* as they used to say , I found that \nI was capable of not only appreciating but of actually performing acts \nso unseemly that… well, in a word, acts which I suppose everyone \nperforms but which I happened to perform, as if deliberately , at the \nmoment when I was most aware they ought not to be performed? \nAnd the more I was aware of the Good, of everything “beautiful and \nsublime”, the deeper I sank into my own mire and the more capable I \nwas of being submerged in it altogether. But the main thing was not \nthat I just happened to do it, but that it felt as if it was right and proper \nfor it to be like that, as if it was my absolutely normal condition – not \nat all an illness or a damaging addiction. So, at last, even the desire \nto struggle against the addiction left me and it all ended up with my \nalmost believing, or perhaps really believing, that it was my absolutely \nnormal condition and not an illness or addiction at all. But at first, at \nthe beginning, how much torment I suffered in that struggle! I did not \nbelieve that the same sort of thing happened to other people and all my \nlife I kept it to myself, as a secret. I was ashamed of it – and perhaps I \nstill feel ashamed. It reached such a point that I used to feel a sort of \nsecret, abnormal, contemptible little delight* coming back to my corner \non some foul Petersburg night, acutely aware that only that day I’d \ndone something abominable, that what had been done could in no way \nbe undone; and I would inwardly , secretly , gnaw , gnaw at myself with \nmy teeth, rasp and suck away at myself, until the bitterness turned into \nsome shameful, damnable sweetness and finally into definite, serious \ndelight. Y es, into delight! Into delight! I insist on that. In fact, that’s \nwhy I started this conversation: because I want to know for certain \nwhether other people experience this kind of delight.\n\f\npar t  one  · chapter  2\n11\nI’ll explain. The delight that I felt came precisely from being too \nacutely aware of my own degradation, from the feeling that you’ve \ncome up against a brick wall, that it’s bad but at the same time cannot \nbe otherwise, that there is no way out, that you’ll never become a \ndifferent person, that even if you still had sufficient time or belief to \nchange into something else, you probably wouldn’t want to change. \nAnd if you did want to, you probably wouldn’t do anything about it \nbecause, in fact, there’s simply nothing to change into. But the main and \nfinal point is this: it all happens in accordance with the normal, basic \nlaws of heightened awareness, and the inertia that follows from these \nlaws. Therefore, it’s not only that you can’t change yourself, but that \nthere’s nothing in this case that you can do about it. So, for example, \nas a consequence of heightened awareness, one feels comfortable \nperforming villainous actions, as though it’s a consolation to a villain \nto realize that he really is a villain. But enough… Oh! I’ve blathered on \nbut what have I explained?… How to explain this delight? But I will \nexplain! I’ll get there in the end! That’s why I took up my pen…\nI am, for example, terribly touchy . I’m mistrustful and quick to \ntake offence, like a hunchback or a dwarf. But there have been actual \nmoments in my life when, if somebody had slapped my face, I would \nperhaps have been glad even of that. I’m being serious: I probably would \nhave been able to find a kind of delight, even on such an occasion. \nOf course, a delight of despair. But in moments of despair there can \nbe the most acute delight, particularly when you can see no way out \nof your situation. And when your face has been slapped – well, then \nyou’ll be crushed by the consciousness of the pulp to which you’ve been \nreduced. But the main thing is, whichever way you look at it, the result \nis that I’m always the first to be blamed and, worst of all, I’m guilty \nthough guiltless, so to speak, simply for acting in conformity with the \nlaws of nature. I am held responsible first, because I’m more intelligent \nthan anyone else around me. (I have always considered myself more \nintelligent than anyone around me and, would you believe it, sometimes \nI was even ashamed of it; at least, all my life I have averted my gaze and \ncould never look people straight in the eye.) And that is why , in the last \nresort, I am responsible: because, even if I’d had any magnanimity of \nspirit, I would have been aware of its irrelevance and then become even \nmore tormented. I would probably not have been able to do anything \nwith my magnanimity – not even forgive, because the offender probably\n\f\nnotes  from  underground\n12\nwould have slapped me in conformity with the laws of nature. Y ou can’t \nforgive the laws of nature – but nor can you forget them because, laws \nof nature or not, the sense of grievance still remains. And finally , even \nif I had no desire whatsoever to be magnanimous but, on the contrary , \nwanted to take revenge on the offender, I would not have been able to \ntake revenge on anyone because, even if I had been able, I would never \nhave dared. Why wouldn’t I have dared? About this, I want to say a \ncouple of words more.\n3\nY\nou  see , people  who know how to take revenge, or anyway to stand \nup for themselves – how do they actually do it? As soon as a feeling \nof revenge takes hold of them, it does so to the exclusion of everything \nelse. That individual will then go straight for his goal like a mad bull, \nwith his head lowered and horns pointing straight in front of him, and \nonly a wall would stop him. (By the way , when faced with a wall these \nsorts of people – that is to say , spontaneous and decisive people – genu-\ninely give up. For them a wall is not an obstacle to be circumvented, as it \nis for example for us, people who think and therefore do nothing; it’s not \nan excuse for turning away from the road, an excuse in which we think-\ning people don’t really believe but which we’re only too pleased to have. \nNo, they give up, quite genuinely . The wall has a calming effect on them, \nprovides them with a moral escape, something final and perhaps even \nsomething mystical… but more about the wall later.) Well, I consider a \nspontaneous individual like this to be a real, normal person – as tender \nMother Nature hoped for when she obligingly set him upon this earth \n– and of such a man I am green with envy . He’s stupid – I don’t deny that. \nBut perhaps a normal person is bound to be stupid. How can one know? \nThat may even be very beautiful. And I am all the more confirmed in \nmy – so to speak – hunch that if, for instance, you take the antithesis \nof a normal man, that is to say a man of intense awareness, a man who \nhas of course appeared not as a natural phenomenon but out of a test \ntube (this, gentlemen, is almost mysticism but I have a hunch about that \ntoo), that this test-tube man sometimes gives up so completely when \nfaced with his antithesis that he genuinely considers himself, with all \nhis intense awareness, to be a mouse and not a man. Alright, let it be"

But here we’re talking \nof a man and, consequently , etc… And, above all, his own opinion of \nhimself is that he’s a mouse. Nobody asks him to think that – but this is \nan important point.\nNow let’s have a look at this mouse in action. Let’s assume that it has \ntaken offence – and it almost always feels offended – and also that it \nwants to take revenge. And perhaps it has concentrated in itself more \nresentment than there is in l’homme de la nature et de la vérité *, a \nnasty , base, petty desire to pay the offender back in kind, and perhaps \nthe nastiness is still working away in it more than it does in l’homme de \nla nature et de la vérité, because l’homme de la nature et de la vérité, in \nhis innate stupidity , considers his act of revenge to be merely a matter \nof justice, while the mouse, in consequence of its intensified awareness, \nrejects the justice of it. And now we’re at last at the very heart of the \nmatter, at the very act of revenge. Wretched mouse! Apart from the \none original nastiness it has heaped up around itself, in the form of \nquestions and doubts, so many other vile things, it has added to that \nsingle question so many unresolved questions and doubts that, willy-\nnilly , there has collected round it some sort of fatal swill, a kind of \nstinking slurry consisting of its doubts, of its worries and finally of \nthe spittle which rains on it from the spontaneous decision-makers, in \nthe shape of judges, dictators and so on, standing triumphantly round \nit, roaring with laughter at the top of their healthy lungs. Naturally \nenough, all that’s left for it to do is to dismiss it all with a wave of its \nlittle paw and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it doesn’t \nitself believe, to slip shamefully through its little crack. There, in its \nnasty , stinking hole under the floorboards, our mouse – wounded, \ncrushed and derided – immediately sinks into a cold, poisonous and \nabove all everlasting resentment. For forty years on end it will continue \nto recall its humiliation down to the very last, most shameful detail, and \nat the same time will add details even more shameful, spitefully teasing \nitself, working itself up with its own fantasies. It will be ashamed of \nits own fantasies but, in spite of that, it will recall everything, it will \npick every thing over; it will invent imaginary things about itself that \nmight have happened and it will forgive nothing. Probably it will start \nto take revenge, but, somehow , in snatches, in trifles, from behind the \nstove, incognito, without believing either in its right to take revenge or \nin the success of its acts of vengeance and knowing in advance that,"

It is so \nrefined, sometimes so elusive to the conscious mind, that people with \njust a slightly limited intelligence – or even simply people with strong \nnerves – will not understand a single thing about it. “Perhaps,” you will \nadd with a grin, “people whose faces have never been slapped will not \nunderstand it either,” and so you will politely hint that I may have had \nmy face slapped and therefore speak from experience.
