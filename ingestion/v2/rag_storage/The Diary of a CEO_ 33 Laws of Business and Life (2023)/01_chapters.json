    "raw_text": "team; the CEOs of the billion-dollar companies you use every day; and\nmore of the world’s leading psychologists than I could possibly name.\nI published these conversations in the form of a podcast called The\nDiary Of A CEO, and that podcast quickly became the most downloaded\npodcast here in Europe and one of the top business podcasts in the USA,\nIreland, Australia and the Middle East. It is arguably one of the fastest-\ngrowing podcasts in the world right now, increasing its listenership by 825\nper cent last year alone.\nI’ve been lucky enough to be exposed to some unique experiences, and\na few years ago it dawned on me how much valuable and powerful\ninformation I’ve gained – and only a handful of people on earth have access\nto that information. I also realised that at the very heart of all the success\nand failure I’ve seen, both in my own entrepreneurial journey and the\nhundreds of interviews I’ve conducted, were a set of laws that could stand\nthe test of time, transfer to any industry, and be used by anyone who is\ntrying to build something great or become someone great.\nThis is not a book about business strategy. Strategy changes like the\nseasons. This is a book about something much more permanent. This is a\nbook about the fundamental, enduring laws of building great things and\nbecoming great yourself.\nThese laws can be used by anyone, regardless of your industry or\noccupation.\nThese laws will work now or 100 years from now.\nThese laws are rooted in psychology, science and centuries of research,\nand to further validate these laws I surveyed tens of thousands of people\nacross every continent, every age group and every profession.\n \n  \nThe design of this book is based on five core beliefs:\n1. I believe most books are longer than they need to be."

    "raw_text": "This pillar is about you. Your self-awareness, self-control, self-care,\nself-conduct, self-esteem and self-story. The self is the only thing we have\ndirect control over; to master it, which is no easy task, is to master your\nentire world.\nPILLAR  II: THE STO RY\nEverything that stands in your way is a human. Science, psychology and\nhistory have shown that there is no graph, data or information that stands a\ngreater chance of positively influencing those humans than a truly great\nstory.\nStories are the single most powerful weapon any leader can arm\nthemselves with – they are the currency of humanity. Those who tell\ncaptivating, inspiring, emotional stories rule the world.\nThis pillar is about storytelling and how to harness the laws of\nstorytelling to persuade the humans that stand in your way to follow you, to\nbuy from you, to believe you, to trust you, to click, to act, to hear you and\nto understand you.\nPILLAR  III: THE PHILO SO PHY\nIn business, sports and academia, an individual’s personal philosophies are\nthe single biggest predictors of how they’ll behave, now and in the future –\nif you know someone’s philosophy or beliefs, you can accurately forecast\nhow they’ll behave in any situation.\nThis pillar is about the personal and professional philosophies that great\npeople believe and live by and how those philosophies result in behaviour\nthat leads to greatness. Your philosophy is the set of beliefs, values or\nprinciples that guide your behaviour – they are the fundamental beliefs that\nunderpin your actions.\nPILLAR  IV : THE TEAM\nThe definition of the word ‘company’ is ‘group of people’; at its essence,\nevery company, project or organisation is just a group of people. Everything\nthe organisation produces, good or bad, originates from the minds of the\n\f\nmembers of your group of people. The most important success factor in\nyour work is who you choose to work with.\nI’ve never seen anyone build a great company, project or organisation\nwithout a group of people, and I’ve never seen anyone reach personal\ngreatness without the support of a group of people.\nThis pillar is about how to assemble and get the best out of your group\nof people. Assembling any group of people is not enough; for your group of\npeople to become a truly great team, you need the right people, bound\ntogether by the right culture. When you have great people bound by a great\nculture, the whole team becomes greater than the sum of its parts. When 1 +\n1 = 3, great things happen.\n\f\nPILLAR I \nTHE SELF"

    "raw_text": "LAW  1\nFILL YO U R  FIV E BU CKETS IN  THE R IGHT\nO R D ER\nThis law explains the five buckets that determine your human potential, how\nto fill them and, crucially, in which order you should fill them.\nMy friend David was in the front garden of his home, enjoying his morning\nespresso, as a sweaty, confused-looking, panting man in tired gym attire\njogged towards him slowly.\nThe jogging man paused in his stride and greeted my friend David as he\nstruggled to catch his breath. He cracked an unintelligible joke, appeared to\nlaugh frantically at it, then began erratically talking about the spaceship he\nwas building, the microchips he was going to put in monkeys’ brains, and\nthe AI-powered house robots he was going to create.\nMoments later, the jogging man said goodbye to David, and continued\nhis slow, sweaty trudge down the street.\nThat sweaty jogging man was Elon Musk. Billionaire founder of Tesla,\nSpaceX, Neuralink, OpenAI, Paypal, Zip2 and The Boring Company.\nBefore I revealed the identity of the sweaty jogging man, you may have\nunderstandably assumed he was an escapee of the local psychiatric facility,\nor suffering from some psychotic break. But once you heard his name, all\nthose extraordinary aforementioned ambitions suddenly became believable.\nSo believable, in fact, that when Elon tells the world of his ambitions,\npeople will blindly give billions of dollars of their children’s inheritance to\n\f\nback him, they’ll quit their jobs and relocate to work for him, and they’ll\npre-order his products before he’s even created them.\nThis is because Elon has filled his five buckets – in fact all of the people\nI’ve met that possess the power to build truly great things have five\nbrimming buckets.\nThe sum of these five buckets is the sum of your professional potential.\nThe fullness of these buckets will determine how big, believable and\nachievable your dreams are to you, and to those that hear them.\nThose that achieve great things have spent years, often decades, pouring\ninto these five buckets. Someone fortunate enough to have five full buckets\nhas all the potential needed to change the world.\nWhen you’re seeking employment, selecting the next book you want to\nread or deciding what dream to pursue, you must be aware of how full your\nbuckets are.\nTHE FIV E BU CKETS\n1. What you know (your knowledge)\n2. What you can do (your skills)\n3. Who you know (your network)\n4. What you have (your resources)\n5. What the world thinks of you (your reputation)\nAt the start of my career, as an 18-year-old start-up founder, I was haunted\nby a moral question that I couldn’t seem to shake: is focusing my time and\nenergy on building a company (which would ultimately enrich me) a more\nnoble pursuit than going back to where I was born in Africa and investing\nmy time and energy in saving even one life?\n\f\nThis question remained at the front of my mind for several years until\none chance encounter in New York granted me some much-needed clarity. I\nattended an event hosted by Radhanath Swami, a world-renowned guru,\nmonk and spiritual leader, at an event he was holding in New York.\nAs I squeezed in among a sea of the Swami’s mesmerised followers,\nwho were starry-eyed and hanging on to his every word in a perfectly still,\nappreciative silence, the guru asked if anyone in the crowd had a question\nfor him.\nI raised my hand. The guru gestured at me to deliver my question. I\nasked, ‘Is building a business, and enriching myself, a more noble pursuit\nthan going back to Africa to try and save lives?’\nThe guru stared at me as if he could see into the depths of my soul, and\nafter a long, blinkless pause he proclaimed: ‘You cannot pour from empty\nbuckets.’\nAlmost a decade on from that moment, it’s never been clearer what the\nguru meant. He was telling me to focus on filling my own buckets, because\nsomeone with full buckets can positively bend the world in any way he or\nshe desires.\nHaving now built several large companies, worked with the biggest\norganisations in the world, become a multimillionaire, managed thousands\nof people, read hundreds of books and spent 700 hours interviewing the\nworld’s most successful people, my buckets are sufficiently full. Because of\nthis, I now possess the knowledge, skills, network, resources and\nreputation to help millions of people all over the world, which is exactly\nwhat I intend to spend the rest of my life doing, through my philanthropic\nwork, the donations I make, the organisations I create, the media companies\nI build and the school I’m working to launch.\n\f\nThese five buckets are interconnected – filling one helps to fill another –\nand they are generally filled in order from left to right.\nWe usually start our professional life acquiring knowledge (school,\nuniversity, etc.), and when this knowledge is applied, we call it a skill.\nWhen you have knowledge and skills you become professionally valuable\nto others and your network grows. Consequently, when you have\nknowledge, skills and a network, your access to resources expands, and\nonce you have knowledge, skills, a valuable network and resources, you\nwill undoubtedly earn a reputation.\nWith these five buckets and their interconnected relationship in mind,\nit’s clear that an investment in the first bucket (knowledge) is the highest-\nyielding investment you can make. Because when that knowledge is applied\n(skill), it inevitably cascades to fill your remaining buckets.\nIf you truly understand this, you’ll understand that a job that pays you\nslightly more cash (resources), but gives you far less knowledge and fewer\nskills, is a lower-paying job.\nThe force that clouds our ability to act upon this logic is usually ego.\nOur ego has an incredible ability to persuade us to skip the first two buckets\n– convincing us to take a job simply for more money (bucket 4) or a job\ntitle, status or reputation (bucket 5), without the knowledge (bucket 1) or\nskills (bucket 2) to succeed in that role.\nWhen we succumb to this temptation, we’re building our career on\nweak foundations. These short-term decisions – your inability to delay your\ngratification, be patient and invest in your first two buckets – will ultimately\ncatch up with you.\n\f\nIn 2017, a very talented 21-year-old employee called Richard walked\ninto my office and told me he had some news to share with me. He told me\nthat he had been offered a job as CEO of a new marketing company\nhalfway across the world, and that he wanted to leave my company – where\nhe had been flourishing – to take it. He told me the role offered him an\nenormous pay rise (almost double what we paid him), an equity package\nand a chance to live in New York City – a far cry from the dreary village he\nwas raised in and an apparent step up from Manchester, England, where he\nworked for my company.\nTo be totally frank, I didn’t believe him. I couldn’t fathom that a\nlegitimate business would offer a junior employee, with no management\nexperience, such a prominent role.\nNonetheless, I accepted his claims and told him that we would support\nhim in his transition out of our company.\nIt turns out I was wrong – Richard was telling the truth. The job offer\ndid exist and a month later he became CEO of the company, moved to New\nYork and started his new life as a C-suite executive in the Big Apple,\nleading a team of more than 20 people, in a rapidly growing marketing\nstart-up.\nUnfortunately, that is not where the story ends; as life would come to\nteach both me and Richard, there is no skipping the first two buckets of\nknowledge and skills if you’re playing for long-term, sustainable results.\nAny attempt to do so is equivalent to building your house on sand.\nWithin 18 months, the once-promising company Richard had joined had\ngone under, lost its key employees, run out of money and become shrouded\nin controversy relating to management practices. After the company closed,\nRichard was unemployed, far from home, and searching for a new, more\njunior role, in the same industry that we had employed him in.\nWhen deciding which path to take in life, which job to accept or where\nto invest your spare time, remember that knowledge, when applied (skill), is\npower. Prioritise filling those first two buckets and your foundations will\nhave the long-term sustainability you need to prevail, regardless of how\nlife’s tectonic plates move and shake beneath you.\n\f\nI define a professional earthquake as an unpredictable career event that\nadversely impacts you. This could be anything: a technological innovation\nthat disrupts your whole industry, being fired by your employer, or if you’re\na founder, your company going under.\nThere are only two buckets that any such\nprofessional earthquake can never empty\n- it can take aw\u0000y your network, it can\ntake your resources, it can even impact\nyour reputation, but it can never remove\nyour knowledge and it can never unlearn\nyour skills.\nThese first two buckets are your longevity, your foundation and the clearest\npredictor of your future.\nTHE LAW : FILL YO U R  FIV E BU CKETS IN  THE\nR IGHT O R D ER\nApplied knowledge is skill, and the more you can expand and apply your\nknowledge, the more value you’ll create in the world. This value will be\nrepaid in a growing network, abundant resources and a robust reputation.\nMake sure you fill your buckets in the right order."

    "raw_text": "Those who hoard gold have riches for a\nmoment. \nThose who hoard knowledge and skills have\nriches for a lifetime. \nTrue prosperity is what you know and what\nyou can do.\n\f\nLAW  2\nTO  M ASTER  IT, YO U  M U ST CR EATE AN\nO BLIGATIO N  TO  TEACH IT\nThis law explains the simple technique that the world’s most renowned\nintellectuals, authors and philosophers use to become the masters of their\ncraft and how you can use it to develop any skill, master any topic and\nbuild an audience.\nTHE STO RY\nIt felt like the entire population of planet Earth had gathered to watch me\nmelt on stage that evening, but in reality, it was just a handful of my fellow\nsecondary school pupils, their parents and a few teachers.\nI was 14 years old and had been tasked with saying a few closing\nremarks at my school’s exam awards evening. As I walked out onto the\nstage, the auditorium fell into an anticipatory silence.\nAnd there I stood, frozen, terrified and mute, for one of the longest\nminutes anyone has ever endured, staring down at the trembling piece of\npaper clasped between my clammy, nervous hands, on the verge of\nurinating into my own underwear, experiencing what people refer to as\n‘stage fright’.\nThe script I had planned to deliver was shaking with such ferocity that I\ncouldn’t see the words. Eventually I blurted out some improvised, clichéd,\nnonsensical remarks before darting off stage and out of the door as if I were\nbeing followed by a firing squad.\n\f\nFast-forward ten years from that traumatic day and I’m speaking on\nstage 50 weeks a year in every corner of the globe – I’m headlining\nalongside Barack Obama in front of tens of thousands in São Paulo, I’m\nspeaking in sold-out arenas in Barcelona, I’m touring the UK and speaking\nat festivals from Kyiv to Texas to Milan.\nTHE EXPLAN ATIO N\nI went from being a train wreck of a public speaker, to rubbing shoulders\nwith some of the very best to ever do it, and there is one simple law that I\ncredit with this transformation.\nThis law is not just responsible for my on-stage composure,\nperformance and delivery (my skills), it’s also the reason why I have\nsomething interesting to share while I’m on stage (my knowledge):\nI created an obligation to teach.\nThe late spiritual leader Yogi Bhaj\u0000n\nonce said, ‘If you want to learn something,\nread about it. If you want to understand\nsomething, write about it. If you want to\nmaster something, teach it.’\nAt 21 years old, I made a promise to myself that every day at 7pm, I would\nwrite a tweet or make a video delivering a single idea, and then post it\nonline at 8pm.\nOf all the things I’ve done in my life to advance my knowledge and\nskills – to fill my first two buckets – this is the thing that made the most\ndifference. It’s no exaggeration to say that it has completely changed the\ntrajectory of my life, and consequently it’s the piece of advice I urge most\n\f\nstrongly upon anyone looking to become a better thinker, speaker, writer or\ncontent creator.\nThe key factor here is that I made learning, then writing/recording and\nsharing it online, a daily obligation, not just an interest.\nSKIN  IN  THE GAM E\nSoon after creating this obligation, I got feedback in the form of comments\nfrom my audience and analytics from the social platforms; this helped me to\nimprove, and in turn, created a community of people that were following\nme purely for this daily idea. This started as tens of people and almost ten\nyears later that community has grown to almost 10 million followers across\nall channels.\nFrom the first idea I shared, I created a ‘social contract’ with my\naudience – essentially a social obligation to the people who were following\nme specifically for this daily idea – which motivated me to continue posting\nand gave me something to lose – their attention and my reputation – if I\nstopped.\nHaving something to lose is fundamentally what an obligation is, and\nhaving something to lose is sometimes referred to as having ‘skin in the\ngame’.\n‘Skin in the game’ is an important psychological tool to harness if you\nwant to accelerate your learning curve in any area of your life. Having skin\nin the game raises the stakes of your learning by building deeper\npsychological incentives to perform a behaviour. The ‘skin’ can be anything\nfrom money to a personal public commitment.\nYou want to learn more about a specific company? Buy a few shares of\nthe stock. You want to learn about Web 3.0? Buy an NFT. If you want to be\nconsistent in the gym, make a WhatsApp group with your friends where\nyou share your workouts every day. In these three examples, either\nmonetary or social currency is at stake.\n‘Skin in the game’ works because across several global studies it’s been\ndemonstrated that human behaviour is more strongly driven by the"

Publishing your written ideas forces you to learn more often\nand to write more clearly. Publishing a video forces you to improve your\nspeaking skills and to articulate your thoughts. Sharing your ideas on stage\nteaches you how to hold an audience and tell captivating stories. In any area\nof your life, doing it in public, and creating an obligation that forces you to\ndo it consistently, will lead you to mastery.\nOne of the most valuable elements of this obligation was having to distil\nany idea I wanted to share down to its 140-character essence, so that it\ncould fit within the constraints of a tweet.\nBeing able to simplify an idea and\nsuccessfully share it with others is both\nthe path to understanding it and the\nproof that you do.

It\nalso explains why most of your arguments are never productive.\nTHE STO RY\nFor most of my childhood I witnessed my mother shouting heatedly at my\nfather as he sat watching TV, apparently completely oblivious to her\npresence. These ear-piercing screaming marathons were like nothing I’d\never witnessed before and nothing I’ve witnessed since.\nShe could shout at him for five or six hours – about the same thing –\nusing the same words, without any apparent reduction in volume or\nenthusiasm. On occasion, my father might try and argue back for a brief\nmoment, and when he inevitably failed to land his rebuttal, he would either\ncontinue to ignore her or flee to another part of the house, lock himself in\nhis bedroom, or jump in the car and drive off.\nIt took me 20 years to realise that I’d learned this exact conflict-\nresolution strategy from him, while I was lying in bed at 2am as my angry\ngirlfriend badgered me, on repeat, about something she was unhappy about.\nI rebutted her with ‘I disagree’ and attempted to make a convincing\ncounterargument. Needless to say, I failed. Like throwing petrol onto a\nbonfire, she carried on shouting at me with increased volume, making the\nsame point, using the exact same words.\n\f\nEventually, I got up and tried to leave, and she followed me, so I locked\nmyself inside my walk-in wardrobe, where I remained until almost 5am,\nbeing shouted at through the door – about the same thing, using the same\nwords, like a broken record player – without any apparent reduction in\nvolume or enthusiasm.\nShe’s now my ex-girlfriend; unsurprisingly, that relationship didn’t last.\nTHE EXPLAN ATIO N\nThe truth is, in every interpersonal conflict in your life – business, romantic\nor platonic – communication is both the problem and the solution.\nYou can predict the long-term health of any relationship by whether\neach conflict makes the relationship stronger or weaker.\nHealthy conict strengthens\nrelationships because those involved are\nworking ag\u0000inst a problem; unhealthy\nconict weakens a relationship because\nthose involved are working ag\u0000inst each\nother.\nI sat down with Tali Sharot, professor of cognitive neuroscience at\nUniversity College London and MIT, to understand what the science of the\nbrain can teach us about the laws of effective communication, and what she\nshared with me changed my personal life, romantic relationships and\nbusiness negotiations for ever.\nSharot and her team’s study, published in Nature Neuroscience,\nrecorded the brain activity of volunteers during disagreements to find out\nwhat was happening inside their minds."

    "raw_text": "The experiment was based on asking 42 people, grouped into pairs, to\nmake a financial evaluation. Each pair lay, separated by a glass wall, in a\nbrain-imaging scanner. Their reactions to the experiment were recorded.\nThey were shown pictures of real estate and asked, individually within their\npairs, to guess its value and to place a bet on the accuracy of their valuation.\nEach volunteer was able to see the valuation of their partner on a screen.\nWhen the couple agreed on a valuation, they each placed higher bets on\nits accuracy and the researchers monitoring their brain activity saw their\nbrains light up, indicating that they were more cognitively receptive and\nopen. However, if they disagreed about a valuation, their brains seemed to\nfreeze and shut down, causing them to turn off to the other’s opinion and\nvalue that opinion less.\nSharot’s findings shed light on some recent trends around contentious areas\nof political discourse. An example being climate change: despite scientists\npresenting more and more irrefutable evidence over the last ten years\nshowing that climate change is man-made, a survey conducted by the Pew\nResearch Centre indicates that the number of US Republicans who believe\nthe scientific evidence has decreased in the same ten-year period. Furious\narguing, regardless of evidence, is clearly not working.\nSo, here’s what needs to be done if we want to increase our chances of\nbeing heard by someone on an opposing side. According to Sharot, if you\n\f\nwant to keep someone’s brain lit up and receptive to your point of view,\nyou must not start your response with a statement of disagreement.\nWhen you find yourself disagreeing with someone, avoid the emotional\ntemptation, at all costs, to start your response with ‘I disagree’ or ‘You’re\nwrong’, and instead introduce your rebuttal with what you have in common,\nwhat you agree on, and the parts of their argument that you can understand.\nThe strength of any carefully reasoned,\nlogical argument isn’t likely to be\nrecognised when you open with\ndisagreement - regardless of how much\nevidence you have or how objectively\ncorrect you are.\nInstead, if we start from a place of agreement, of common ground, we\nincrease the chance that the strength of our arguments, the accuracy of our\nlogic and the weight of the evidence will be received at all.\nThis third law – to never disagree – is the critical skill that will allow\nyou to become an effective negotiator, speaker, salesperson, business leader,\nwriter – and partner.\nWhen I interviewed Julian Treasure, the speaking and communication\ncoach whose TED talk has been viewed 100 million times, and Paul\nBrunson, the matchmaking and relationship expert known as ‘the love\ndoctor’, they both explained that the art of becoming a great communicator,\nconversationalist or partner is first listening so that the other person feels\n‘heard’, and then making sure you reply in a way that makes them feel\n‘understood’.\nTali Sharot’s studies in neuroscience now provide clear scientific\nevidence that shows why this approach of making someone feel ‘heard and"

    "raw_text": "LAW  4\nYO U  D O  N O T GET TO  CHO O SE W HAT YO U\nBELIEV E\nThis law will teach you how to change any belief that you have – whether\nthat’s your self-belief, beliefs about others or beliefs about the world –\nwhile also showing you how to change the stubborn beliefs of others.\nThink of someone that you absolutely love: your mother, your father, your\npartner, your dog – the most important person (or animal) in your life.\nNow visualise them tied to a chair, being held at gunpoint by an\naggressive terrorist.\nNow imagine that the terrorist says to you, ‘If you don’t believe that I’m\nJesus Christ right now, I will pull the trigger and kill them!’\nWhat do you do?\nThe truth is, the most you could do is lie – the most you could do is tell\nthem that you believe they’re Jesus Christ, in the hope that your loved one\nwould be spared. But you couldn’t, genuinely, make yourself believe it.\nThis thought experiment illuminates a profound and controversial point\nabout the true nature of our beliefs. In my hypothetical scenario, when\neverything was on the line, you still couldn’t choose to believe something\nthat you don’t. So, what makes you think you can ‘choose’ any of your\nbeliefs?\nTo investigate this concept further, I surveyed 1,000 people and asked\nthem all the following question: ‘Do you think you choose your beliefs?’\nIncredibly, 857 (85.7 per cent) of them said that they did.\n\f\nOn the next page of the survey, when I asked people if they could\ngenuinely believe a terrorist holding their loved one at gunpoint was Jesus\nChrist if it meant it would save their loved one’s life, 98 per cent of people\nadmitted that they couldn’t choose that belief – the most they could do was\nlie.\nThe fundamental beliefs you hold about yourself, the fundamental\nbeliefs you hold about others, the fundamental beliefs you hold about the\nworld – you’ve ‘chosen’ none of them.\nWhen people hear this, they tend to have a visceral negative reaction,\nbecause it sounds disempowering and attacks our sense of ‘free will’,\ncontrol and independence. If I can’t choose a belief, how can I ever change\na belief? Does that condemn me to the current beliefs I have about the\nworld, others and myself?\nThankfully, it doesn’t.\nYour life is a testament to the fact that your beliefs do continually\nchange and evolve – I’m assuming you don’t still believe in Santa Claus?\nSociety too, continues to change its beliefs at an increasing speed; in the\n1700s, people thought tobacco was healthy and doctors would blow tobacco\nsmoke up the arse of a drowned person in an attempt to revive them; in the\n1800s we believed clitoral orgasms were a sign of insanity and doctors\nwould medically treat people who had them; as recently as the 1970s,\npeople believed space aliens were sending us coded messages by flattening\nour crops on farms in middle America; and medieval doctors pulled their\ncures out of their arses, literally – poop was believed to be a cure for\neverything from headaches to epilepsy.\nThankfully, beliefs change.\n \n  \nOur brains consume a huge amount of energy and have therefore evolved\nstrategies to preserve energy in order to survive. Because one of the brain’s\nmain purposes is to predict by spotting patterns and making assumptions\n\f\nbased on those patterns, it must do so as efficiently and in as little time as\npossible. Beliefs allow the brain to make such forecasts quickly.\nHaving stubborn beliefs is a useful survival tool for humans because\nbeliefs drive behaviour – your ancestors, who stubbornly held the belief that\nlions are dangerous, fire is hot and deep water is to be avoided, survived\nlong enough because of these beliefs to have babies who possessed the\nsame stubbornness.\nGoing back to the example of the terrorist holding your loved one\nhostage under threat of execution; now imagine the terrorist grabbed a glass\nof water and turned it into wine (an act Jesus is known for). Would this\nchange your beliefs about the terrorist? Would you now believe that the\nterrorist is in fact Jesus Christ?\nIn my survey, 77 per cent said that this would be enough to convince\nthem that the terrorist was in fact Jesus Christ, and in total 82 per cent said\ntheir beliefs about the terrorist would change – the act of witnessing\nsomeone turn water into wine was strong enough evidence to cause them to\nchange their belief.\nThis thought experiment and the corresponding survey reveal a\nfundamental truth about the nature of all of our beliefs: the things you\nbelieve are fundamentally based on some form of primary evidence.\nHowever, scientific studies have repeatedly proved that whether that\nevidence is objectively true or false doesn’t actually matter – we\nsubjectively accept evidence to be true based on our experiences and biases.\nThere are still 300,000 Americans who believe the earth is flat; in a\nrecent Ipsos survey, 21 per cent of adult Americans said they believed Santa\nClaus is real; a disturbing number of people believe King Charles is a\nvampire; one in three Americans believe Bigfoot exists; and one in four\nScottish people believe there is a giant monster living in a lake near\nInverness.\nTo change their beliefs, simply telling them they’re wrong, as we’ve\nseen in Law 3, won’t work. Showing a flat-earther a legitimate picture of a\nround Planet Earth also doesn’t work, and despite what motivational\ncoaches might say, telling someone who had their confidence destroyed at"

Flat-earthers trust neither; they believe\nNASA is fraudulent, astronauts are actors and the scientific community is in\non it.\nIn Dr Robert Cialdini’s renowned book Influence, he explains that if we\ntrust someone’s authority on a matter – if Lionel Messi tells us that Adidas\nfootball boots are better than Nike, if a personal trainer tells us we’re lifting\na weight incorrectly or if a doctor tells us we need to take a pill – we’re\nvery likely to defer to their authority, adopt their belief and do what they\nsay.\n‘For some of our most important beliefs we\nhave no evidence at all, except that\npeople we love and trust hold these beliefs.\nConsidering how little we know, the\ncondence we have in our beliefs is\npreposterous - and it is also essential.’\n2002 Nobel Prize laureate Daniel Kahneman\nAuthority figures are powerful forces for belief change, but the most\npowerful force of all is first-party evidence from our own five physical\n\f\nsenses. As the phrase goes, seeing is believing. Because the flat-earth\ncommunity is so distrustful of science, astronomy and really anyone\nqualified, the only conceivable way that you could upend their stubborn\nbeliefs is to send them to space to have a look for themselves.\nThis need to see evidence with our own eyes explains why so many\ncrazy conspiracy theories withstand the test of time – why people dismiss\nclimate change, believe the earth is flat and question the efficacy of\nvaccines – these things are impossible for most of us to see for ourselves.\nLikewise, someone lacking confidence in their speaking abilities is\nunlikely to become confident just because their mum tells them they’re a\ngood speaker – they will need to acquire first-party evidence themselves, by\nspeaking on stage and getting positive feedback from bias-free sources they\ntrust.\nWe believe ourselves and our own eyes to be trusted sources, making it\nimportant for scientists to involve our five senses to make their insights\naccessible to us. With this principle in mind, climate-change educators are\nnow trying to translate scientific insights about the occurrence and speed of\nclimate change into ‘local lessons’, for example showing the impact of\nclimate change on things in our local area so that we can go and see it for\nourselves.\nCO N FID EN CE IN  EXISTIN G BELIEFS\nI asked Tali Sharot, who we met in the previous law, ‘How do we change\nour or someone else’s belief?’ She has spent years researching and\nconducting multiple studies on why beliefs exist, why they’re hard to\nchange and how to change them.\nShe told me that the brain considers any new evidence alongside the\ncurrent evidence it has stored. So, if I told you I had seen a pink elephant\nflying in the sky, your brain will compare this new evidence to your\nexisting evidence that elephants aren’t pink and they can’t fly, and likely\nreject it."

    "raw_text": "However, if I told a three-year-old that I had seen a pink elephant flying\nin the sky, they would likely believe me because they have yet to form\nstrong opposing beliefs about elephants, aviation and the laws of physics.\nSharot asserts that there are four factors that determine whether a new\npiece of evidence will change an existing belief:\n1. A person’s current evidence.\n2. Their confidence in their current evidence.\n3. The new evidence.\n4. Their confidence in that new evidence.\nAnd as we learn from the widely discussed phenomenon called\n‘confirmation bias’, whereby humans tend to search for, favour and recall\ninformation in a way that confirms or supports their existing beliefs or\nvalues – the further the new evidence is from their current beliefs, the less\nlikely it is to change their thinking.\nW E CHAN GE O U R  M IN D S IF IT SO U N D S LIKE\nGO O D  N EW S!\nAll of this means that strongly held false beliefs are very hard to change,\nbut there is one important exception: when the counter-evidence is exactly\nwhat you want to hear, you’re more likely to change your mind. For\nexample, in a 2011 study in which people were told that others see them as\nmuch more attractive than they see themselves, they were happy to change\ntheir self-perception. And in a 2016 study in which people learned that their\ngenes suggested that they were much more resistant to disease than they\nthought, the participants were again quick to change their beliefs.\nWhat about politics? Back in August 2016, 900 American citizens were\nasked to predict the results of the presidential election by putting a little\n\f\narrow on a scale that went from Clinton to Trump. So, if you thought\nClinton was highly likely to win, you put the arrow right next to Clinton. If\nyou thought the odds were 50/50, you put the arrow in the middle, and so\non. They were first asked: ‘Who do you want to win?’ to which 50 per cent\nsaid they wanted Clinton to win and 50 per cent said they wanted Trump to\nwin.\nWhen they were asked who they thought was going to win, both groups\nof supporters put the arrow closest to Clinton – indicating that they believed\nshe would win. Then a new poll was introduced, predicting a Trump\nvictory. And everyone was asked again who they thought was going to win.\nDid the new poll change their predictions?\nIndeed, it did. But it predominantly changed the predictions of the\nTrump supporters – because it was exactly what they wanted to hear. They\nwere elated that the new poll was suggesting a Trump victory, and were\nquick to change their predictions.\nThe Clinton supporters didn’t change their predictions much, and many\nof them ignored the new poll altogether.\nD O N ’T ATTACK BELIEFS, IN SPIR E N EW  O N ES\nTali Sharot concluded that in order to change beliefs, ‘the secret is to go\nalong with how our brain works, not to fight against it’, which is what most\npeople try and fail to do.\nDon’t try and break or argue with someone’s existing evidence; instead\nfocus on implanting completely new evidence, and make sure you’ve\nhighlighted the incredibly positive impact this new evidence will have on\nthem.\nOne example of this is of parents’ reaction to the false link drawn up\nbetween the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, in a\nnow-debunked journal article that was published in 1998. As news of the\narticle’s theory spread, many parents refused to vaccinate their children, and\nheld on to their beliefs stubbornly. Eventually, a group of researchers\nchanged their minds, not by trying to break their existing beliefs – they\n\f\ndidn’t focus on their existing beliefs at all – but by offering the parents new\ninformation about the very positive benefits of the vaccine – true\ninformation about how it prevents kids from encountering deadly disease.\nAnd it worked – parents agreed to have their children vaccinated.\nD ETAILED  SELF-R EV IEW  CAN  R ED U CE AN Y\nBELIEF\nInterestingly, people won’t lower the conviction of their beliefs when you\nattack them or try to convince them with data, but they will lose conviction\nwhen asked to explain or analyse the details of their beliefs. This is a\ntechnique cognitive behavioural therapists know well.\nThe New Yorker’s Elizabeth Kolbert described a study conducted at Yale\nwhere graduate students were asked to rate their understanding of their own\ntoilet at home. They were then asked to write detailed, step-by-step\nexplanations of how the device works. Once they’d attempted to explain the\ninner workings of a toilet, they were asked to rate their understanding again.\nTheir belief in their understanding of toilets dropped significantly.\nIn a similar study conducted in 2012, people were asked about their\nstance on political proposals relating to health care. As Kolbert describes,\n‘Participants were asked to rate their positions depending on how strongly\nthey agreed or disagreed. Next, they were instructed to explain, in as much\ndetail as they could, the impacts of implementing each proposal. Most\npeople at this point ran into trouble.’ Asked once again to rate their views,\nthe conviction of their beliefs decreased and they either agreed or disagreed\nless vehemently.\nAsking someone to explain the detail and logic underpinning their\nstrongly held beliefs is a profoundly powerful way to reduce their\nconviction. This works for limiting beliefs too. If someone is struggling\nwith their self-belief and believes they’re worthless, having them explain in\nas much detail as they can, why they feel that way, and questioning their\nresponses, is an effective way to get them to relinquish that belief."

Telling me it\nwas ‘all going to be OK’ was not enough to change my preconceptions\nabout speaking on stage, how I would perform and what the reaction would\nbe – my beliefs were too stubborn.\nThe reason my stage fright eventually vanished – to the point that now I\nfeel 99.9 per cent less nervous when speaking in a packed arena or live on\nTV – is simply because I carried on speaking on stage. And doing so\ngradually gave me new, positive, first-party evidence that replaced the\nexisting evidence I had about my on-stage abilities – the more I spoke on\nstage, the stronger my confidence in this new evidence became, and with it,\nthe belief in my inability and the fear it created diminished.\n‘D o the thing you fear, and keep on doing\nit. That is the quickest and surest way ever\nyet discovered to conquer fear.’\nDale Carnegie\nThis, for me, is maybe the most important fundamental truth about belief\nchange and how to increase a person’s self-belief – even your own; beliefs\nchange when a person gets new counteracting evidence that they have a\nhigh degree of subjective confidence in.\nIf a friend of yours has a limiting belief about themselves, or you have a\nlimiting belief about yourself, the best chance you have of changing that\nbelief isn’t by reading self-help books, inspirational quotes or watching\nmotivational videos, it’s by stepping out of your comfort zone and into a\nsituation where that limiting belief will be confronted head on with new\nfirst-party evidence.\n\f\nThis is how you change even the most stubborn beliefs.

    "raw_text": "lean in – and more specifically to launch their own social media pages. I\nfailed. I was berated, mocked and dismissed. The marketing director I was\npitching to was visibly terrified: ‘So people will be able to comment on our\nposts and criticise us?’ he questioned. ‘I don’t want our brand to go viral –\nhow would we control that?’ he continued. ‘Magazine advertising is doing\nwell for us and social media is just too dangerous.’ He ended the meeting\nmidway through my presentation and needless to say, he never called me\nback.\nMy company would go from strength to strength, arguably becoming\nthe most influential marketing company in its market.\nThe brand I met that day filed for bankruptcy in 2019.\nTHE EXPLAN ATIO N\nLeaning out, as I define it, isn’t about being ‘wrong’ – it’s about being so\narrogantly sure that you’re right that you refuse to listen, learn and pay\nattention to new information.\nThis isn’t just a symptom of arrogance – unfortunately, it’s often a\nsymptom of being human; the psychological reason why people lean out of\nimportant, potentially vital information is because of the incredibly well-\nstudied psychological phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance.\nCoined by the American psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1950s,\n‘cognitive dissonance’ describes the tension you experience when your\nthoughts conflict with your behaviour. Being a smoker, for example, is\ndissonant – it conflicts with the evidence that smoking is incredibly\nharmful. To resolve this tension, the smoker must either give up or find a\nway to justify their behaviour. We can all think of the excuses smokers use,\nfrom ‘I only smoke on occasion’ to ‘there are far worse things you can do to\nyour body’ to ‘why shouldn’t I be free to behave as I choose?’\nFor Festinger, cognitive dissonance helped explain why so many of us\nlive with contradictory ideas or values. But it can also stop us from\nchanging our minds when we should, even when it could save careers, jobs,\nbusinesses or lives.\n\f\nResearch has shown that cognitive\ndissona\u0000ce is most painful for us when we\nencounter facts or evidence that\ndestabilise or conict with how we see\nourselves, that undermine our identity\nand condence in ourselves, or that make\nus feel in some way threatened.\nIn business, anyone who is too rigidly fixed to an ideology probably won’t\nprovide the solution, because resolving a problem often requires enough\nhumility to disregard your initial hypothesis and listen to what the market is\ntelling you.\nW E W O U LD  R ATHER  BE D EAD  THAN\nW R O N G\nMaking a public statement about your views on something, as the CEO of\nIntel did about mobile phones, or the CEO of Microsoft did about the\niPhone, risks putting an additional nail in your coffin, because once we’ve\nmade a commitment to a belief, our brains will fight tirelessly to prove that\nwe were right, even when we’re clearly wrong.\nTime and time again, research shows that as soon as we make any\ndecision – I will vote for this party; I’m going to buy a house in this area; I\nthink Covid-19 is serious; no, I’m sure the risks are being exaggerated – we\nautomatically begin justifying and rationalising it. Quite quickly any doubts\nwe initially had will disappear.\nThe American psychologist Elliot Aronson, who studied this\nphenomenon, famously assembled a discussion group of pompous, dull\n\f\npeople. Some of the participants were made to endure an arduous selection\nprocess; others were allowed to join immediately, without expending any\neffort. Those who were given the runaround reported enjoying the group far\nmore than the ones who were simply let in. Aronson explained what was\nhappening here: whenever we’ve invested time, money or energy into\nsomething and it ends up being a complete waste of time, this creates\ndissonance, which we try to reduce by finding ways of justifying our bad\ndecision. Aronson’s participants focused unconsciously on what might be\ninteresting, or at least bearable, about being part of a deliberately boring\ngroup. The people who had invested very little effort in joining therefore\nhad less dissonance to reduce, and more readily admitted what a waste of\ntime it had been.\nW E W O N ’T LISTEN  TO  THE O THER  SID E\nIt wasn’t just that fashion brand’s marketing director that dismissed me. For\nthe first three years of my social media marketing company’s existence, we\nwere attacked, berated and criticised daily.\nCommentators called us ‘parasites’, said our business was a ‘fad’ and\npredicted we’d be ‘bankrupt in a few months’. I remember consoling my\ntearful co-founder, Hannah Anderson, in 2015, when BuzzFeed News wrote\na critical article challenging our character, practices and credibility.\nUnsurprisingly, the attacks always came from people from the\n‘traditional’ media and marketing world – TV, print and radio. They viewed\nus as the annoying ‘new kids on the marketing block’. One commentator\nsaid we were ‘mysterious social media hackers’ and another journalist\nwrote that we were making millions from our ‘less than savoury advertising\npractices’.\nThe truth is, we weren’t doing anything that revolutionary – they just\ndidn’t understand it, and on some level it threatened their sense of identity\nthat a ‘group of twentysomethings in Manchester’ was taking over\nmarketing, as one journalist described it.\n\f\nWhen we don’t understand something, someone, a new idea or\ntechnology, and when that new thing challenges our identity, intelligence or\nlivelihood, instead of listening and leaning in – in an attempt to ease our\ncognitive dissonance – we too often lean out and attack them. This might\nmake us feel good, but an ostrich with its head in the sand is at great risk of\nbeing eaten.\nThis explains why the most important innovations in our lives received\nthe most criticism when they were first introduced – they threatened to\ndisrupt people’s sense of identity, intelligence and understanding. For this\nvery reason I’ve long held the belief that passionate criticism of a\ntechnology is usually a positive indicator of its potential – it’s a sign that\nthere’s something worth leaning in to, someone is threatened and innovation\nis coming.\nThis is why I leaned in to what is known as ‘Web 3.0’, ‘blockchain\ntechnology’ or ‘crypto’, and founded a software company in this space\ncalled thirdweb – because all the right people were dismissing, attacking\nand angry about it. This wave of pessimism gave me flashbacks to 2012\nwhen I first launched a Web 2.0 (social media) company, and so I reserved\njudgement and did my own research. Beneath all the nefarious money-\ngrabbing and short-sighted behaviour – which is common when a new\ntechnology emerges – I found an underlying technological revolution in\nblockchain that I believe will make many functions of our lives easier,\nbetter, faster and cheaper. Thirdweb was recently valued at $160 million in\nour latest investment round and we now have hundreds of thousands of\nclients using our tools.\nEven if a new innovation doesn’t beget a wave of critics, it’s important\nto remember that innovation disrupts because it’s different. By definition, it\nshould look weird, it should feel unconventional, it should be\nmisunderstood, and it should sound wrong, stupid, dumb or even illegal.\nI interviewed advertising legend Rory Sutherland, vice chairman of the\nOgilvy advertising group, on this very topic, and he told me: ‘All too often,\nwhat matters to people is not whether an idea is true or effective, but"

New things put ego, status, jobs and identities at stake.’\nYou see this cognitive dissonance and avoidance everywhere you look.\nWhenever we feel an affinity with an ideology, politician, newspaper, brand\nor technology, that very allegiance distorts evidence that conflicts with\nthose loyalties. If we believe someone is ‘on the other side’, there is\ndissonance before they’ve said a word.\nHO W  TO  BECO M E A ‘LEAN -IN  PER SO N ’\nTo quote the education entrepreneur Michael Simmons: ‘If someone is 40\nyears old today, the rate of change they experience in 2040, when they’re\n60, will be four times what it is now. What feels like a year’s worth of\nchange by today’s standards will occur in three months. When someone\nwho is 10 today is 60, they’ll experience a year of today’s rate of change in\njust 11 days.’\nTo summarise the profundity of this extreme acceleration of change,\nRay Kurzweil, arguably the world’s pre-eminent futurist, says: ‘We won’t\nexperience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first\ncentury; we will witness in the order of twenty thousand years of progress\n(when measured by today’s rate of progress), or about one thousand times\ngreater [rate of change] than what was achieved in the twentieth century.’\nChange is only going to get faster - so\nexpect your feelings of cognitive\ndissona\u0000ce - the feeling that something\ndoesn’t make sense and conicts with\nwhat you already know, to increase.\n\f\nAs discussed in Laws 3 and 4, admitting we’re wrong – rather than\nreflexively jumping to self-justification or dismissal – requires self-\nreflection and, at least temporarily, dissonance.\nYou don’t want to be the entrepreneur that misses the next technological\nrevolution, you don’t want to be the CMO that dismisses the next big\nmarketing opportunity, you don’t want to be the journalist that dismisses the\nnext frontier of media. You don’t want to be a ‘lean out’ person. With the\naforementioned rate of change in mind, there’s going to be a lot more things\nthat tempt you to lean out.\nThankfully, there are a few practical and mental techniques we can\nadopt to reduce this dissonance and the ‘lean out’ behaviour it creates.\nOne technique is to default to believing that two seemingly conflicting\nideas can be true at the same time and having a bias to keep them separate,\na technique Elliot Aronson and his fellow social psychologist Carol Tavris\nrefer to as the ‘Shimon Peres solution’. Former prime minister of Israel\nShimon Peres was angry when his friend Ronald Reagan, the American\npresident, made an official visit to a cemetery in Germany where former\nNazis were buried.\nPeres was asked how he felt about Reagan’s decision to visit the\ncemetery. He could have chosen one of two ways to reduce dissonance:\n1. Renounced the friendship.\n2. Dismissed Reagan’s visit as trivial and not worth worrying about.\nYet Peres resorted to neither of these responses, instead simply saying,\n‘When a friend makes a mistake, the friend remains a friend and the\nmistake remains a mistake.’\nPeres managed to ‘hold’ the dissonance, and resisted the urge to force\ntwo things to make perfect sense. It’s a lesson in avoiding easy, knee-jerk\nresponses or being pressured into a binary choice, and instead accepting\nnuance and recognising that two apparently conflicting things can be true at\nthe same time. Despite what passionate online tribalism might tempt you to"

    "raw_text": "LAW  6\nASK, D O N ’T TELL - THE\nQU ESTIO N /BEHAV IO U R  EFFECT\nThis law reveals one of the most simple and effective psychological tricks\nthat you can use to motivate someone to do something, form a habit or\nperform a desired behaviour. You can use it on yourself or someone else!\nIt’s 1980 in America. Ronald Reagan is running for president against\nJimmy Carter, who’d been elected in 1976. The economy is in a horrific\nstate, and Reagan must convince voters that it’s time to kick Carter out of\nthe White House.\nIn the last week of the 1980 presidential campaign, on 28 October, the\ntwo candidates held their one and only presidential debate and 80.6 million\nviewers tuned in to watch – making it the most-watched debate in American\nhistory at the time.\nGoing into the debate, incumbent President Carter had an eight-point\nlead according to polls.\nReagan knew he needed to use Carter’s abysmal economic performance\nagainst him but, instead of doing what every presidential candidate before\nhim had done and stating the economic facts, he did something that no one\nhad ever done, but every presidential candidate seems to have done since:\nhe asked a simple but now legendary question, ‘Are you better off now than\nyou were four years ago?’ He said:\n\f\nNext Tuesday, all of you will go to the polls, you’ll stand there in\nthe polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that\ndecision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better\noff than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy\nthings in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less\nunemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is\nAmerica as respected throughout the world as it was?  . . . And if\nyou answer all of those questions yes, why then I think your choice\nis very obvious as to who you will vote for.\nA televote poll carried out by ABC News immediately after the debate\nreceived about 650,000 responses – and almost 70 per cent of respondents\nsaid Reagan had won the debate. Seven days later, on 4 November, Reagan\ndefeated Carter by ten points, in a historic landslide victory, to become the\n40th president of the United States.\nJust a question? No, political magic backed by science. Why?\nQuestions, unlike statements, elicit an active response – they make\npeople think. That’s why researchers at Ohio State University have found\nthat when the facts are clearly on your side, questions become extremely\nmore effective than simply making a statement.\n\f\nTHE PO W ER  O F THE QU ESTIO N /BEHAV IO U R\nEFFECT\nWe all make commitments we fail to honour. How many times have you\nsaid, ‘I’ll eat better this year’ or ‘I’ll exercise every morning this week’,\nonly to fall short of your plan? Of course we intend to follow through, but\ngood intentions aren’t enough to create meaningful change. A well-\ndesigned question, however, might be.\nAfter combing through more than 100 studies spanning 40 years of\nresearch, a team of scientists from four US universities discovered that\nasking is better than telling when it comes to influencing your own or\nanother’s behaviour.\nDavid Sprott, a co-author of the research from Washington State\nUniversity said: ‘If you question a person about performing a future\nbehavior, the likelihood of that behavior happening will change.’ Questions\nprompt a psychological reaction that is different from the reaction to\nstatements.\nThis means, for instance, that a sign that says, P LEASE  RECYCLE is much\nless likely to increase its viewers’ chance of recycling than a sign that says,\nW ILL  YOU  RECYCLE ? Telling yourself ‘I will eat vegetables today’ is less\nlikely to increase your chances of eating vegetables than asking yourself the\nquestion, ‘Will I eat vegetables today?’\nAstonishingly, researchers found that turning a statement into a question\ncould influence a person’s behaviour for up to six months.\n\f\nThe question/behaviour effect is even more powerful with questions that\ncan only be answered with either yes or no.\nThe question/behaviour effect is at its strongest when questions are used\nto encourage behaviour that fits the receiver’s personal and social ambitions\n(when answering yes to the question would bring them closer to who they\nwant to be).\nStarting the question with ‘will’ implies ownership and action, and\ncauses the question/behaviour effect to be even stronger than starting your\nquestion with a word like ‘can’ or ‘could’, which imply the question is\nabout ability rather than action. It’s also stronger than starting your question"

    "raw_text": "with ‘would’, which is conditional and implies possibility more than\nprobability.\nU SIN G CO GN ITIV E D ISSO N AN CE IN  YO U R\nFAV O U R\nIn Law 5 I explained how harmful the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance\ncan be, I’m now going to tell you how helpful it can be.\nCognitive dissonance describes the mental discomfort you experience\nwhen the best you – the person you really want to be – doesn’t match up\nwith the person you currently are. Let’s say you aspire to be an expert in Tai\nChi and a friend asks whether you practise Tai Chi daily. Answering no\nwould create cognitive dissonance because it would highlight a\ndisconcerting mismatch between who you want to be and who you actually\nare. To remove that mismatch you’re likely to answer yes. And, once\nyou’ve done that, your aspiration is more likely to become a reality because\nthe question has reminded you of not only who you want to be but the path\nto becoming that person, and you’ve set an intention to walk that path – all\nin the form of one small but powerful question.\nThe reason this works even more effectively when answering a yes or\nno question is because these binary choices don’t allow for justification and\nexcuses – both of which allow us to wriggle away from confronting the\nreality of who we want to be and what we need to do to get there.\nIf you’ve read my first book, you’ll know that my wonderful PA,\nSophie, likes to announce every week that she’s ‘going to the gym on\nMonday’. On occasion, when I’ve been naive and gullible enough to ask\nher if she went to the gym on the aforesaid Monday, she’ll respond with a\nlong, elaborate reason why it wasn’t possible and follow that with a new\nannouncement that she’s going to go next Monday instead. She’s continued\nthis routine every week for eight years now.\n\f\nThe great thing about a ‘yes’ or ‘no’\nquestion is it doesn’t give you any wiggle\nroom to deceive yourself. It forces you to\ncommit one way or the other.\nSo, if you start making excuses for your behaviour or want to lecture\nsomeone about what they should do differently, try this instead: ask yourself\nor them a simple question to which the answer can only be yes or no. It\nworks really well when focusing on an area that could benefit from some\nadditional motivation. ‘Will I go to the gym today?’ ‘Will I order healthy\nfood for lunch?’ Allow no explanation. Just yes or no. Recently, I went for a\nrun near my girlfriend’s house in Porto, Portugal. The area is known for its\nsteep hills, but as I approached one particularly terrifying hill that was so\nsteep it appeared almost vertical, the question/behaviour effect came to my\nrescue. I asked myself, ‘Will you keep running – without stopping – until\nyou’ve reached the top?’ I told myself ‘yes’. I can’t really explain it, but for\nsome reason it really helped – I made it to the top without stopping; it killed\nany possible excuses I might have used to stop and it created a promise to\nmyself that I didn’t want to break.\nUse the question/behaviour effect to help others: ask a friend or loved\none, ‘Will you eat more healthily?’ or ‘Will you go for that promotion?’\nThis gentle confrontation has been repeatedly proven to lead to reliable,\nmeaningful change and encourages people to be their best selves.\nUse it in your job. If you’re a waiter in a restaurant serving a table of\nhappy customers, instead of telling them ‘I hope you enjoyed your food’\nwhen you’re collecting their plates, instead ask ‘How was the food?’ just as\nyou’re handing over the bill, right before it’s time for them to decide on the\ntip. As President Reagan taught us, when the facts are clearly on your side,\nquestions become extremely powerful tools for encouraging the behaviour\nyou want.\n\f\nTHE LAW : ASK, D O N ’T TELL - THE\nQU ESTIO N /BEHAV IO U R  EFFECT\nIf you want to create positive behaviour, don’t make statements, ask binary\nyes or no questions. People are more likely to answer ‘yes’ if it will bring\nthem closer to who they want to be, and once they answer ‘yes’, that yes is\nmore likely to come true.\n\f\nAsk questions of your actions, and your\nactions will answer.\n\f\nLAW  7\nN EV ER  CO M PR O M ISE YO U R  SELF-STO RY\nThis law introduces a concept you’ve probably never heard before called\nyour ‘self-story’; it shows you how your self-story determines your success\nin life, and gives you the secret strategy for writing a better self-story about\nyourself, so you can achieve big ambitions.\n‘A lot of people don’t know this  . . . ’ Chris Eubank Jr said, as he leaned\nforward ominously in his chair.\nChris Eubank Jr, championship boxer and son of the International\nBoxing Hall of Fame legend Chris Eubank, had stopped by my house to be\ninterviewed by me in preparation for this book.\nHe continued:\n . . . but 80 per cent of being a fighter is mental. The balls, the guts\nand the grit that you have to have, to walk through crowds of\nthousands of people. And while you’re walking, knowing that once\nyou get to that ring and walk up those stairs, you’re going to have to\ntake off your jacket. The bell’s going to ring and you’re going to\nhave to fight somebody. You’re going to have to get hurt and you’re\ngoing to have to hurt somebody, in front of millions of people\nwatching around the world. That in itself, that walk, most people on\nthe planet cannot do that. Just the walk, let alone the fight part, it\ntakes huge mental strength.\nM e: Do you think you can train someone to have that mental strength?\n\f\nEubank Jr: I think you can; I’ve seen fighters develop it, and you need\nit. At the end of the day, there are going to be times in training, in sparring\nand definitely in fighting where you’re going to get really hurt. You’re\ngoing to be in a position where you’re questioning yourself. What am I\ndoing here? Am I going to be OK? Can I beat this guy? Should I give up?\nShould I find a way out? This is too much. Every fighter experiences that\nmoment, you know.\nM e: Have you ever seriously considered quitting in a fight?\n*Long pause*\nEubank Jr: There was this one time where I was close to giving up. I\nwent to Cuba before I turned pro. Out there, the guys are animals. They’re\nmonsters. I get in the ring to do a casual sparring session and then the\nCuban Olympic heavyweight representative walks up the stairs and gets\ninto the ring. I thought he was coming into the ring to shadow box and\nwarm up for his sparring session with somebody else. And they said, ‘No,\nno, no, no, you guys are going to spar.’ I was like, ‘Uh, he’s about three\ntimes the size of me. What do you mean?’ And they said, ‘No, no, he’ll\nwork with you, just a casual spar.’ So I thought, Sure. That’s fine. Let’s go.\nThe bell goes for the first round and this guy sprints over to me and just\nstarts laying into me. The biggest shots I’ve ever taken. Bang, bang, bang.\nI’m dodging, moving out the way, running around the ring. And he’s just\ncoming at me and I can’t get this guy off me.\nBang, bang, bang. He knocks me out of the ring! It’s a four-foot drop\nout of the ring onto solid concrete. My knee hits the concrete and my leg\ngoes completely dead. I tried getting up and my leg is completely gone. I’m\nlooking up and this Cuban heavyweight is leaning over the ropes, looking\ndown at me. I’m at a mental crossroads and I have a decision to make. Do I\nsay, ‘Listen, my knee’s bad. You’re too big.’ Or do I get back in. I’m sat\nthere on the concrete, looking around. Everyone’s looking at me, my dad is\nthere. I made a decision. I was like, you know what, let’s fucking go. I got\nback in, and the Cuban just started laying into me again for another two\npainful rounds  . . . But the only thing I could think was: I have to finish the\n\f\nthree rounds, because I said I was going to do the three rounds. I’m not\nleaving this gym with everybody knowing that I quit. Because I couldn’t live\nwith myself. I’ve got to go home and go to sleep. I can’t go to sleep knowing\nthat another man made me quit. So I got back into that ring and I took my\nbeating like a man. And from that day on, I was never scared again. It was\nthe worst experience of my life, but it was also the best experience of my\nlife because I now knew what I was capable of. I knew I had it inside me to\nnot give up. If he can’t make me quit, who’s going to make me quit?\nNobody. And that belief stayed with me for the rest of my career.\nM e: That’s incredible. You’re talking about a story you’re writing about\nyourself, for yourself, and how important that story is in determining how\nyou behave in the future.\nEubank Jr: Exactly. In training it happens the most: there are times I’ll\nbe on the treadmill, where I’ll be running, and I’ll get cramp in my calf and\nI’ve still got 8 minutes to go, because I’ve set the timer for 40 minutes and\nI’m on 32 minutes. The cramp starts and I will run with one leg, literally\nlimping, because if the treadmill can make me quit, what happens when I\nget into the ring with a guy who’s hit me, and I’m hurt? He’s going to make\nme quit too. It’s hugely important because it teaches you to believe that no\nmatter how hard things get, you are the type of person that will find a way.\nIt doesn’t matter if people are watching, or if nobody would know I\nquit. You can’t quit when no one is watching – you don’t ever want to put\nthat, that spirit inside yourself, you’ve got to keep those demons out. They\nare demons and if you let them in often enough, they will take over!\n‘I hated every minute of traini\u0000g, but I\nsaid, “D on’t quit. Suﬀer now and live the\nrest of your life as a champion.” ’\nMuhammad Ali\n\f\nYO U R  SELF-STO RY CR EATES ‘M EN TAL\nTO U GHN ESS’\nThe US military is the most powerful on earth. Each year, roughly 1,300\ncadets join its famously demanding military academy at West Point. Part of\ntheir initiation involves a series of extremely difficult challenges called\n‘Beast Barracks’. These, according to researchers who studied West Point\ncadets, are ‘deliberately engineered to test the very limits of cadets’ mental\ncapacities’.\nWhen I read about this study, I, like most people, assumed that the\ncadets with the most stamina, intelligence, physical strength and athleticism\nwould be the most successful. But when Angela Duckworth, a researcher at\nthe University of Pennsylvania, studied their achievements, and more\nspecifically, how mental toughness, perseverance and passion impact ability\nto achieve goals, she found something very surprising.\nDuckworth tracked almost 2,500 cadets spread across two initiation\nclasses. She compared several metrics including their high school rank,\nSAT scores, Physical Aptitude Test results and Grit Scale (which measures\nperseverance and passion for long-term goals with a grade from one to\nfive).\nIt turned out that it wasn’t physical strength, intelligence or leadership\npotential that gave the most accurate indication of whether a cadet would\nmake it through Beast Barracks – it came down to mental toughness,\nmatched with determination to reach a long-term goal. Perseverance was\nthe most important thing. Believe it or not, cadets who were just one\nstandard deviation point higher on the Grit Scale were 60 per cent more\nlikely to make it through Beast Barracks.\nResearch continues to reveal that your self-story and the ‘mental\ntoughness’, ‘grit’ or ‘resilience’ that you have is more important than\nanything else for achieving your goals in business and in life. That’s very\ngood to know because while you can’t do much about your physicality or\nthe innate abilities you are born with, you can do a lot to develop your self-\nstory.\n\f\nUnfortunately, our self-story isn’t just influenced by the first-party\nevidence we’ve collected about ourselves, it’s also influenced profoundly\nby the stereotypes around us. For instance, if the society you live in holds\nthe stereotype that Black people are less capable than white people – and\nyou’re a Black person – you will likely internalise that belief and it will\nbecome part of your self-story; the science shows how this stereotype alone\ncan significantly impact your self-story, your performance and ultimately\nyour results.\nAt eight years old, I was eagerly putting on my swimming shorts in the\nschool changing room ahead of my first swimming lesson, when a fellow\npupil turned to me and casually said, ‘Did you know Black people can’t\nswim? Their bodies are different, so it won’t be easy for you today!’ I am of\nEnglish and African heritage, so in that moment, with that one casual\ncomment, not only did my excitement evaporate, but so did my belief that I\nwould ever be able to swim. Needless to say, that swimming lesson did not\ngo well – I flapped around like a drowning dog and ultimately gave up\nhalfway through the lesson. It would take me 18 years, and someone\ncredible convincing me that this wasn’t true, for me to finally learn how to\nswim.\nA remarkable study published in 1995 used something called ‘priming’\nto demonstrate the effects that this type of ‘stereotype threat’ can have on\nyour self-story.\nResearchers gave a group of students a difficult vocabulary test, but\nbefore the test began, they asked some of the Black students questions\nabout their race. Astonishingly, the Black students who were asked about\ntheir race performed worse on the test, scoring lower than both the white\nstudents and the Black students who had not been questioned. Importantly,\nwhen students were not asked these questions, the scores were comparable.\nThe insidious impact a negative stereotype can have on someone’s self-\nstory isn’t just observed in matters of race. In another study, researchers\nwanted to test the pernicious myth that says women aren’t as good at maths\nas men. Before setting both male and female undergraduates the test, some\nof the participants heard the researcher say that as a rule, men and women\n\f\nscored differently on this test; others were told that men and women had\npreviously scored equally.\nThe women who heard the researcher’s negative comments performed\nsignificantly worse, reported greater anxiety and had lower expectations\nabout their performance than the men. This experiment confirmed earlier\nstudies by finding that when participants were exposed to a comment about\ntheir gender, a stereotype threat kicked in and their performance\ndeteriorated.\nSo, what would happen if a woman could escape her identity, change\nher self-story and pretend to be someone else while writing the test?\nA researcher called Shen Zhang set out to test this. Zhang gave 110\nfemale undergraduates and 72 male undergraduates 30 multiple-choice\nmaths questions. Before the test, each of them was told that men do better at\nmaths than women. In addition, some of the volunteers were then told to\ntake the test under their real name, but others were to complete it under one\nof four invented names: Jacob Tyler, Scott Lyons, Jessica Peterson or\nKaitlyn Woods.\nThe men outperformed the women in the test. But astoundingly, women\nwho assumed an alias, whether it was male or female, outperformed the\nwomen who didn’t. And – importantly – the women adopting an alias did\njust as well as the men!\nThis demonstrated once and for all the merits of tests and interviews\nusing alternative identification methods that avoided names – in the\nresearcher’s words, this would potentially ‘allow stigmatised individuals to\ndisconnect their self from a threatening situation’, and crucially, ‘disarm\nnegative stereotypes’.\nTHE SCIEN CE O F D EV ELO PIN G A STR O N G\nSELF-STO RY IN  YO U R  HEALTH, W O R K AN D  LIFE\nThe ‘self-story’ Chris Eubank Jr was describing is a theory scientists and\npsychologists know well and refer to as your ‘self-concept’. It is our\n\f\npersonal belief of who we are, encompassing all our thoughts and feelings\nabout ourselves – physically, personally and socially. It includes our beliefs\nabout our capabilities, our potential and our competence.\nYour self-story develops most rapidly during early childhood and\nadolescence, but it continues to form and change as we collect more\nevidence about ourselves throughout our adult life.\nYO U R  SELF-STO RY CR EATES M EN TAL TO U GHN ESS\nPsychology professor Fatwa Tentama states that individual ‘resilience’ is\ninfluenced by having a positive self-story. Individuals with a positive self-\nstory will be more optimistic, persevere for longer in the face of adversity,\nhandle stress better and achieve their goals more easily.\n‘Individuals with a low self-concept will\nbelieve and view themselves as weak,\nincompetent, unwelcome, lose interest in\nlife, be pessimistic about life and give up\neasily.’\nLaura Polk, scientist and leadership expert\nOne study on students, conducted by Eka Aryani, a scientist at Mercu\nBuana University of Yogyakarta in Indonesia, sought to understand the\nrelationship between self-story and resilience, and concluded that ‘self-\nstory’ is almost 40 per cent of what makes a student ‘mentally tough’. The\nother 60 per cent of factors that can affect individual resilience include\nactual abilities, family factors, and community factors.\n\f\nSo how do we improve our self-story so\nthat we can be resilient and optimistic,\nachieve our goals and persevere in the\nface of adversity?\nCR EATIN G A STR O N GER  SELF-STO RY\nYou’ve probably heard this quote by legendary college basketball coach\nJohn Wooden: ‘The true test of a man’s character is what he does when no\none is watching.’ This is true, but according to science, it’s also true that a\nperson’s character is created, built or destroyed when no one is watching.\nEverything you do - with or without an\naudience - provides evidence to you\nabout who you are and what you’re\ncap\u0000ble of.\nAs we discovered in Law 4, first-party evidence – that is, everything you\nobserve with your own senses – is by far the strongest evidence when it\ncomes to creating or changing a belief.\nYou’re in the gym alone lifting weights, you’re on your last set and\nyou’ve got to do ten repetitions to complete the workout. You get to the\nninth rep and your muscles are burning – what do you do?\nYour choice, in this moment, may seem inconsequential – but every\ndecision we make writes another line of powerful first-party evidence,\nabout who we are, how we respond to adversity and what we’re capable of,\ninto today’s chapter of our self-story.\nThat evidence will not only become self-fulfilling in the gym, it will\npermeate the rest of your life and relentlessly influence your behaviour.\n\f\nThat evidence will whisper to you when things are difficult – ‘just drop\nthe weight’, ‘just give up’, ‘remember, you can’t do this’ – and science\nshows that in the face of adversity, negative self-evidence will cause you\nmore stress, more worry and more anxiety than a story full of perseverance,\novercoming and victory.\nWhat we believe about ourselves creates our thoughts and feelings, our\nthoughts and feelings determine our actions, and our actions create our\nevidence. To create new evidence you must change your actions.\nChoose to do the tenth rep when it would be easier to stop at nine. Choose\nto have the difficult conversation when it would be easier to avoid it.\nChoose to ask the extra question when it would be easier to stay silent.\nProve to yourself – in a thousand tiny ways, at every opportunity you get –\nthat you have what it takes to overcome the challenges of life. And if you\ndo – only then will you actually have what it takes to overcome the\nchallenges of life – a robust, positive, evidence-based self-story.\nTHE LAW : N EV ER  CO M PR O M ISE YO U R  SELF-\nSTO RY\n\f\nMental toughness is required for enduring success, and it’s principally\nderived from having a positive self-story. To build your self-story, you need\nevidence, and that evidence is derived from the choices you make in the\nface of adversity. Be wary of counter-evidence and the insidious long-term\nimpact it can have on your self-belief and behaviour. If an eight-year-old\ntells you that you can’t swim, tell him to fuck off.\n\f\nThe most convincing sign that someone\nwill achieve new results in the fut\u0000re is\nnew behaviour in the present."

It shows you why fighting bad habits is a failing\nstrategy which often leads to rebounding – and what you should do instead.\nI grew up worrying that my dad was going to die.\nAt some point before I turned ten, my siblings and I discovered that Dad\nwas a secret smoker – presumably he’d hidden it from us to stop us\nreplicating his habit. But once we’d found his miniature cigars, he began\nsmoking in front of us.\nSurprisingly to me, he only ever smoked in the car. Never at parties,\nnever at home, never at work, only in the car. I made a few subtle attempts\nto get him to quit, but nothing worked. Until one day, ten years later, when I\ninadvertently led him to finally quit his 40-year habit.\nIn order to explain what happened, I first need to briefly explain how\nhabits are held in place."

    "raw_text": "The concept of habit loops was introduced by Charles Duhigg in his book\nThe Power of Habit, in which he explores how and why habits develop,\nwhy they stick and how we can break them. Simplified, a habit loop\nconsists of three key elements:\nCU E: The trigger for habitual behaviour (e.g., a stressful meeting\nor negative event).\nR O U TIN E: The habitual behaviour (e.g., smoking a cigarette or\neating choc\u0000late).\nR EW AR D : The result/impact on you of the habitual behaviour\n(e.g., a feeling of relief or happiness).\n\f\nWhen I was 18 years old, after dropping out of university to build my first\ntech start-up, I read a book called Hooked by Nir Eyal which explains how\nbig social media companies and tech companies get their users addicted to\ntheir products by exploiting this habit loop. While I was reading the book, I\nhappened to stop off at home, and accidently left it in my dad’s bathroom.\nMy dad loves to read while he’s on the toilet, and picked the book up. It\ntaught him about his habit loop, and he finally understood the cue (his car),\nroutine (reaching into the car door, grabbing the cigarettes and lighting\none), and reward (nicotine creating a dopamine release in his brain) that\nwere causing him to smoke.\nThe next day he went to his car, took the cigarettes out, put miniature\nlollipops into the cigarette case, and never smoked again. The habit loop\nhad been interrupted. A new, less-addictive habit had taken its place, and\nwith that my father’s health outcomes had drastically improved.\nWhether my father realised it or not, the science shows that the most\nimportant thing he did was not trying to fight the habit, but replacing the\nfinal step of the habit loop with a much less addictive reward – the\nlollipops.\nSome incredible new scientific research has revealed just how foolish it\nis to try and fight your bad habits – and why people always seem to rebound\nwhen they do.\nHave you ever noticed that when you\nfocus too much on stopping something,\nyou ultimately end up rebounding and do\nit more?\nThis is because we are action-oriented creatures, not inaction-oriented\ncreatures.

    "raw_text": "To get something good in life – whether it’s a chocolate cake or a\npromotion – we usually need to take action and do something to\nearn it. Consequently, our brain has adapted to understand that\naction is related to reward. So when we expect something good, a\n‘go’ signal is activated, which makes us more likely to act – and act\nfast.\nSharot describes an experiment where volunteers were told they could\neither press a button to get a reward (one dollar) or press a button to avoid a\nnegative action (losing one dollar). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the volunteers\nwho pressed the button to get the reward did so much more speedily than\nthe volunteers who pressed the button not to lose the dollar.\nThe brain associates rewards with action, so you need to pair an action\nwith a reward.\nAdditionally, some studies have shown that the more you try to suppress\nan action or thought, the more likely you are to take the action, or think\nabout that thought. This is great evidence for the power of manifestation –\nyou get what you think about – but it’s also further evidence that trying to\nfight or not think about a habit is a foolish strategy.\nA 2008 study in Appetite found that the group of volunteers who tried\nnot to think about eating ate more than the group who didn’t. The first\ngroup exhibited what is called a ‘behavioural rebound effect’.\nSimilarly, a 2010 study in Psychological Science found that the group of\nsmokers who tried not to think about smoking actually thought about it\neven more than the group who didn’t.\nThis reminds me of a small piece of advice my driving instructor said to\nme when I was 18: ‘Steven, the car will go where your eyes are looking. If\nyou want to avoid crashing into the cars on the side of the road, don’t focus\non the cars on the side of the road, because you will veer towards the\nparked cars on the side of the road. Look forwards, into the distance, where\nyou want the car to go.’\nThis seems like a fitting analogy for breaking and making habits: you\nwill end up doing the thing you’re focusing on, so don’t focus on stopping"

    "raw_text": "smoking, don’t fight it; focus on the behaviour you want to replace it with.\nThe director of the University of Oregon’s Social and Affective\nNeuroscience Laboratory, Elliot Berkman, says that if you’re a smoker and\nyou tell yourself not to smoke, your brain still hears ‘smoke’. Conversely, if\nyou tell yourself to chew gum every time you want a cigarette, your brain\nhas a more positive, action-orientated goal to focus on. This explains why\nthose miniature lollipops caused my dad to quit smoking: he didn’t just take\nthe cigarettes out of his car door; he replaced them with a new action for his\nbrain to focus on – sucking lollipops.\nIF YO U  W AN T TO  BR EAK A HABIT, GET SO M E\nSLEEP\n‘When do you sleep?’ is a question that I’ve been asked almost weekly for\nthe last ten years, by more interviewers, panel moderators and journalists\nthan I can remember. The implied assumption behind this question – which\nhas always perplexed me – is that I can’t have accomplished extensive\nprofessional success while also getting a sufficient amount of sleep. The\ntruth is very much the opposite – I’ve always slept well. I don’t allow any\nmeeting, call or appointment to be scheduled before 11am and I rarely use\nan alarm clock, because I’ve always known that sleep is the foundation of\nsuccess, not an inhibitor of it.\n‘You’re more likely to do the thing you don’t want to do when you’re\nstressed out,’ said Russell Poldrack, a psychology professor at Stanford\nUniversity – i.e. you’re more likely to search out a dopamine hit, in the\nform of sugar, processed food, drugs, porn or alcohol, if you’re stressed.\nTherefore, one of the most important things you can do to make new\nhabits stick, and perform enough repetitions in that early phase to make the\nneurons in your brain fire together and wire together, is keep your stress\nlevels low – especially in that critical early phase while you’re forming the\nnew habit.\n\f\nOne of the most effective things you can do is also the simplest: get a\ngood night’s sleep. Whatever you’re trying to improve, from your social life\nto your smoking habit, sleep will help.\nIf you’re trying to get fit, getting enough sleep improves your speed,\nyour strength and your endurance. If you’re trying to perform better at\nwork, a lack of sleep will lead you to be less productive – and if you’re a\nmanager, less attentive, less focused, less cheerful and even less ethical.\nIf you’re trying to lose weight or eat more healthily, sleep deprivation\nwill decrease leptin, the hormone that gives your body the signal that you\nare full. It also leads to a corresponding increase in ghrelin, known as the\n‘hunger hormone’, which causes a surge in appetite and fat storage, and can\nlead to you making unhealthy food choices.\nSo, if you want to break old habits and make new ones, forget all the\ncomplicated tips, tricks and hacks, and focus on the basics – you’ll succeed\nif you feel good, if you’re not over-stressed and if you’ve had a good\nnight’s sleep.\nD O  N O T TAKE O N  M O R E THAN  O N E HABIT\nAT A TIM E\nWe all know that willpower is key to success, but until about 25 years ago\nwe had a pretty simplistic view of it as a skill that, once developed, remains\nconstant. This all changed when, during his PhD, Mark Muraven (now\nprofessor at the University at Albany, New York) argued that willpower\nappears to diminish the more we use it.\nIn 1998, he conducted a now famous experiment. In his lab, he set up a\nbowl of radishes and a bowl of freshly baked cookies, then brought in two\ngroups of people who were led to believe the experiment was about taste\nperception. The first group was told they could eat the cookies and ignore\nthe radishes, while the other was asked to ignore the cookies and eat only\nthe radishes.\n\f\nFive minutes into the experiment, a researcher entered the room and,\nafter a 15-minute break, gave both groups a puzzle that was impossible to\ncomplete.\nThe cookie eaters, with their unused reservoirs of willpower, were\nincredibly relaxed, and would continue to try and solve it over and over and\nover again, some of them for over half an hour. On average, the cookie\neaters spent almost 19 minutes trying to solve the puzzle before giving up.\nThe radish eaters – who’d had to restrain themselves from eating the\ndelicious cookies, depleting their willpower – couldn’t have behaved more\ndifferently. They became frustrated and expressed their annoyance. Some\nput their heads on the table hopelessly; others lost their temper and took\nagainst the entire thing, complaining it was a waste of their time. On\naverage, the radish eaters worked for around eight minutes – less than half\nthe time the cookie eaters persevered for – before they gave up.\nSince the cookie/radish study, several researchers have tested and\nproven ‘willpower depletion’: the idea that rather than willpower being\nsimply a skill, it is more like a muscle and – as with any muscle in the body\n– it gets tired as it works harder. In one, participants who were asked not to\nthink about certain things during a first experiment were unable to suppress\nlaughter when the researcher tried to make them giggle. Another\nexperiment asked subjects to watch a tear-jerker without giving in to their\nemotions; in a subsequent test of something physical rather than something\nemotional, the subjects – just like the unfortunate radish-eaters – gave up\nmore quickly.\nSo if the science here is correct, and willpower is a limited resource, it’s\nobvious that the more pressure, restrictions and strain you put on yourself\nwhile trying to make new habits and break old ones, the less chance you\nhave of achieving them and the more chance you have of rebounding.\nFighting habits is a bad idea – it will drain your willpower and increase\nyour chances of yo-yoing back into the habit. This is why unsustainable\ncrash diets do not work – any time you feel like you’re depriving yourself\nof something that you really want, you nearly always fail. For instance, in a\n2014 study, almost 40 per cent of people said they failed to keep their New\n\f\nYear’s resolutions because their goal was too unsustainable or unrealistic,\nand 10 per cent said they failed because they had too many resolutions.\nThis is why making sure your habits are small and achievable enough to\nbe sustainable – without the need for major sacrifice, which will deplete\nyour willpower reserves – is incredibly important. Rather than giving up\nevery unwanted habit you have at the same time, you should aim to have\nfewer goals, which increases the likelihood that you will complete any of\nthem. With too many big, unrealistic, sacrifice-centric goals, your\nwillpower will be under too much strain, it will run out, you’ll fail, and\nyou’ll rebound.\nAnd this is also why so many psychologists and scientists have found\nthat the best way to create a new habit isn’t by fighting an old one or\ndepriving yourself of rewards – which is counter-productive – it’s by\nfinding new rewards, healthier rewards and less addictive rewards, but\nnonetheless making sure you are still rewarding yourself along the way.\nTHE LAW : N EV ER  FIGHT A BAD  HABIT\nIf you want to overcome a habit, do not fight against it. Work with your\nhabit loop and use positive action to replace it. Do not take on more than\none bad habit at once; the more you try and change, the less your chances of\nchanging anything. While you’re creating your new habit, make sure you\ntake care of yourself and get as much sleep as you can."

I\nwasn’t very good with girls. So I thought about cars. I thought about\ngirls, too, but I had more luck with cars.\nLet’s say that when I turned 16, a genie had appeared to me.\nAnd that genie said, ‘I’m going to give you the car of your choice.\nIt’ll be here tomorrow morning with a big bow tied on it. Brand-\nnew. And it’s all yours!’\nHaving heard all the genie stories, I would say, ‘What’s the\ncatch?’ And the genie would answer, ‘There’s only one catch  . . .\nThis is the last car you’re ever going to get in your life. So it’s got to\nlast a lifetime.’\nIf that had happened, I would have picked out a car, but, can you\nimagine, knowing it had to last a lifetime, what I would do with it?\n\f\nI would read the manual about five times. I would always keep\nit garaged. If there was the least little dent or scratch, I’d have it\nfixed right away because I wouldn’t want it rusting. I would baby\nthat car, because it would have to last a lifetime.\nThis is exactly the position you are in concerning your mind and\nbody. You only get one mind, and you only get one body. And it’s\ngot to last a lifetime. Now, it’s very easy to let them ride for many\nyears.\nBut if you don’t take care of that mind and that body, they’ll be\na wreck 40 years later, just like the car would be.\nIt’s what you do right now, today, that determines how your\nmind and body will operate 10, 20, and 30 years from now.\nYou must take care of it.\nI spent the first 80 per cent of my life prioritising work, girls, friends,\nfamily, my dog and my material possessions.\nUntil, that is, I was 27 years old, when I and the rest of the world\nwatched a global virus called Covid-19 sweep through civilisation,\ntragically killing more than 6 million people.\nBecause of the privilege of my youth and the naivety that instilled, up\nuntil then, being ‘healthy’ was something I took for granted. If I’m totally\nhonest, I didn’t care about my health; I cared about looking good – trying to\nget a six-pack – but actually ‘being healthy’ was something I’d fortunately\nnever had to think about.\nI think the global pandemic was psychologically traumatic for most of\nus, but if there was a silver lining for me, it’s that the trauma of those two\nyears etched the unarguable truth into my mind that my health should in\nfact be my top priority.\nAn international team of researchers announced that pooled data from\nscores of peer-reviewed papers capturing almost 400,000 Covid-19 patients\nfound that people with obesity who contracted Covid-19 were 113 per cent\nmore likely to fall so ill that they would need to be hospitalised. Unhealthy\nindividuals were significantly more likely to die.\n\f\nI have a strong enduring belief that none of us actually believe we’re\ngoing to die – this is so clearly evidenced by how we live our lives, the\npetty things we worry about and our attitude to risk. However, Covid-19\nbrought death to my doorstep, I got to see death up close and all too\npersonal for the first time in my life. I was able to ponder its terrifying,\nliberating and uncertain features.\nStaring into the clarifying face of death, I could see how poorly I had\nprioritised my life. I could see that my work, my girlfriend, my friends, my\ndog, my family and everything I owned were all just items placed on a\nfragile table called my ‘health’.\nLife could take any of those items off the table – as it often does – and I\nwould still have everything else on the table. You could remove my dog,\nGod forbid, and I’d still have everything else on the table; you could take\nmy girlfriend off the table, and I would still have everything else; but if you\nremoved the table – my health – everything falls to the floor. I would lose it\nall.\nEverything is contingent on the table.\nEverything is contingent on my health.\nMy health is my first foundation.\nTherefore my health, logically, must be my first priority, every day, for\never.\nAnd crucially, by embracing this reality – by having health as my first\npriority – my life is extended so I can enjoy all of my other priorities (my\ndog, my partner, my family) even more.\nThere is no greater form of gratitude than\ntaking care of yourself.\nThis one realisation changed the trajectory of my life, and for the past three\nyears I have made radical dietary changes – cutting down sugar, processed\nfood and refined grains. I began exercising six days a week – without\n\f\nmissing a week – and I have drastically increased my consumption of water,\nplants and probiotics.\nI’m objectively healthy, which is great, but I also feel amazing – which\nis even better. The positive impact on every part of my life – my business,\nproductivity, sleep, relationship, mood, sex life, confidence – has been so\nprofound that I couldn’t write this book without including taking care of\nyour first foundation as an unavoidable law of greatness.\n‘Those who think they have no time for\nbodily exercise will sooner or later have to\nnd time for illness.’\nEdward Stanley\nTHE LAW : ALW AYS PR IO R ITISE YO U R  FIR ST\nFO U N D ATIO N\nTake care of your body; it is, after all, the only vehicle you get to own, the\nonly vessel you’ll use to explore the world and the only house you can ever\ntruly call a home."

Uninspired by the prospect of using stairs to exit the gaming room, I\ndecided to spend £13,000 on an enormous blue slide with a big ball pool at\nthe bottom.\nBy the time the desks arrived, I had installed a basketball hoop, a fully\nstocked bar, beer taps, a massive tree right in the middle of the office, and\n\f\nseveral other immature fittings.\nOver the next few years, even though the average age of our employees\nwas just 21, the company became the most publicised, the most mentioned,\nthe fastest growing and the most disruptive in its industry. Our sales grew\nby more than 200 per cent per year, on average, for several years in a row.\nOur clients were the world’s biggest brands, and our workforce swelled to\nmore than 500 people by my 25th birthday.\nAnd the most fascinating part of this story is that we never had a sales\nteam.\nWe didn’t need a sales team because we had a massive blue slide.\nI know this sounds crazy – like hyperbole and exaggeration – but\ngenuinely, the single biggest driver of our media publicity for the first few\nyears of our existence was that gigantic blue slide.\nEvery major press title that wrote about us, every TV channel, every\nblog that mentioned us always referenced, joked about or focused in on the\nmassive blue slide.\nBy my company’s third birthday, it had been photographed by\njournalists hundreds of times, and so many journalists had asked me to pose\nlying in the ball pool for their stories that it had become a running joke in\nour office. The minute a journalist would arrive at reception to interview\nme, someone in the office would shout ‘Get in the ball pool!’ at me, without\nfail.\nThe BBC, BuzzFeed, VICE News, Channel 4, Channel 5, ITV, Forbes,\nGQ, the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Financial Times – they all queued up\nto come to our office, to cover our story and to interview us, and the\nheadline image of the story nearly always featured a picture of that big blue\nslide. In one BBC story they called our office the ‘coolest’ in the country,\nand when VICE came to make a documentary about us, the crew spent most\nof their time shooting the ball pool and big blue slide from different angles.\nIn hindsight, our entire founding team all agree, one of the best financial\ndecisions – albeit stupid, unintended and immature – that we made, was\nspending £13,000 of our investment on that big blue slide.\n\f\nAdmittedly, I only saw the slide used a handful of times in the seven\nyears that I ran the company, but the slide’s usefulness should never have\nbeen measured on its intended purpose, but rather on its effectiveness as a\nmarketing message.\nThe slide screamed something about us to the world; it said, ‘this\ncompany is different’, ‘this company is young’, ‘this company is disruptive’\nand ‘this company is innovative’. It communicated that message louder and\nmore convincingly than any marketing campaign we ever crafted.\nIf a picture paints a thousand words, our big blue slide wrote an entire\nbook – and that book is a story of our values, who we are, what we believe\nand how we behave.\nI’m absolutely not telling you to go and blow your money on a big blue\nslide, but I am telling you that your public story will be defined not by all\nthe useful practical things that you do – in many cases, not even by the\nproducts that you sell – but by the useless absurdity that your brand is\nassociated with.\nMy friend recently joined a gym in London called Third Space. Third\nSpace is arguably the largest high-end gym in London, spanning three\npristine floors. In an attempt to get me to join he said, ‘You should come –\nit’s so good, they even have a 100-foot climbing wall in the entrance!’\nDid you see what he did there? He did what everyone does. He didn’t\nmention their hundreds of useful exercise machines, the incredibly useful\nweight racks or the very useful changing rooms; he sold me the gym based\non the most absurd quality it possesses.\nAnd I must be honest, it worked. I’ve now been a member of that gym\nfor more than a year, and in that year, I have never, not once, seen anyone\ngo anywhere near the 100-foot climbing wall.\nBut when you hear that a gym has a 100-foot climbing wall, your\nsubconscious mind thinks, If the gym has a 100-foot climbing wall, then\nthey must have everything! or If a gym has 100-foot climbing wall, it must\nbe huge. Or if you’re Gen Z or a millennial, If a gym has a 100-foot\nclimbing wall they must have so many other fun, crazy things that I can take\na picture of and upload to social media!\n\f\nA brand’s publicity is dened more by its\nuseless absurdity than its useful\npracticalities; the most absurd thing\nabout you says everything about you.\nTESLA’S M AR KETIN G STR ATEGY IS\nABSU R D ITY\nIn a fraction of the time that it’s taken some of their competitors, Tesla has\nbecome one of the world’s bestselling car companies. The Tesla Model Y is\nthe bestselling car in Europe and the Tesla Model 3 is one of the bestselling\nluxury vehicles in the United States. Tesla’s advertising budget is $0.\nLike my marketing agency didn’t need a sales team and my gym\nprobably doesn’t need a marketing team, Tesla doesn’t need to advertise\nbecause it’s a brand driven and defined by its absurdity.\nIt is riddled with intentionally absurd features to make its customers, the\nmedia and the public at large talk, laugh and spread the word about the car.\nWhereas most car companies have named their driving modes ‘Comfort’,\n‘Standard’ and ‘Sport’, Tesla has amusingly embraced the power of\nabsurdity by calling theirs ‘Insane’, ‘Ludicrous’ and ‘Ludicrous+’.\nIn 2019, Teslas got a new ‘Caraoke’ function which allows owners to\nturn their car into a karaoke machine, and in 2015, Tesla famously released\na ‘Bioweapon Defense Mode’ which protects the driver from ‘bioweapons’.\nThey introduced an ‘Arcade’ mode which turns the car into an arcade on\nwheels; they installed ‘Easter eggs’ – hidden features that the driver has to\nfind, which include making the car look like Santa’s sleigh, turning the road\nahead into a rainbow, and even a ‘farting mode’ that causes the car to\nproduce fart sounds from any passenger seat in the car.\nAll these things sound immature and stupid – like my big blue slide –\nbut when you delve into the social-listening data, these absurd features\n\f\nproduce more conversations than the useful features of all of their key\ncompetitors combined.\nPeople have no incentive to think, talk or write about things that\nmaintain the status quo, but they have a tremendous incentive to share\nabsurd things that mock it, tear it down and laugh in the face of it.\nBEER  SHO W ER S HELPED  M AKE BR EW D O G\nBILLIO N S\nBrewDog, the indie brewery, became the fastest-growing beer brand in the\nUK in 2019. They too have been in operation for far less time than most of\ntheir rivals and they have a fraction of the marketing budget of some of\ntheir global competitors – some two centuries old or more. But once again,\nthis financial disadvantage hasn’t inhibited their marketing reach, because\ntheir strategy – for better or for worse – intentionally evokes the power of\nabsurdity in spreading their message.\nWhen they launched the BrewDog hotel chain in 2021, they installed\nbeer fridges inside every shower so that customers can guzzle beer as they\nwash. I’m pretty sure nobody – at least no sane person – is going to use it,\nbut a quick Google Images search shows that a significant number of\nphotos of the hotels contain a picture of the beer fridge in the shower. The\nmost absurd thing about the brand is saying everything about the brand.\nWithout directly saying anything at all, the presence of that beer fridge\nscreams to customers: ‘we are for beer lovers’, ‘we are a punk brand’, ‘we\ndon’t care about the rules’, ‘we are disruptive’, ‘we have a sense of\nhumour’, ‘this hotel is for people that are different’, and again, if you’re in\na younger generation, it’s saying, ‘this hotel will give you great content for\nyour social media channels’.\n\f\nIf it’s that powerful, why doesn’t everyone lean in to absurdity? Because\nmost business leaders, CFOs and accountants demand direct measurable\nROI from their marketing, brand and product initiatives. The absurdity I’m\ndescribing is incredibly difficult to measure or quantify, and so like many\nthings in marketing, storytelling and branding – you either believe in it or\nyou don’t.\nFrom what I’ve witnessed over my decade-long tenure of advising the\nworld’s leading brands, those few people that do believe in, and act upon,\nthe power of absurdity, are nearly always company founders (appointed\nCEOs are typically more risk averse, have less financial control and have\nless conviction about brand values). Their marketing dollar nearly always\ngoes ten times further than their rivals’, and they always seem to outpace\nthe rest of their industry over the long term. Most importantly, they’re just\nmore fun people to work with.\nIf you look around you, you’ll notice that the most powerful brand\nstorytelling leverages the power of absurdity, illogicality, costliness,\ninefficiency and nonsensicality, because convention, similarity and\nrationality, for all their usefulness, convey no message about who you are\nand who you aren’t.\n‘M eani\u0000g is conveyed by the things we do\nthat are not in our own short-term self-\ninterest - by the costs that we incur and\nthe risks we take.’\nRory Sutherland, vice chairman of the Ogilvy advertising group\nTHE LAW : U SELESS ABSU R D ITY W ILL\nD EFIN E YO U  M O R E THAN  U SEFU L\nPR ACTICALITIES\n\f\nYou’ll be known for the most absurd things you do. Those absurd things\nwill do the job of saying everything about you, and you won’t have to say\nanything at all. Absurdity is more effective and more fun, but it’s not for the\nfaint-hearted: it’s for the risk taker, the idiot and the genius.\n\f\nN ormality is ignored.\nAbsurdity sells.\n\f\nLAW  11\nAV O ID  W ALLPAPER  AT ALL CO STS\nThis law will teach you the science of grabbing people’s attention in\neverything you write, speak and produce. It’s the underlying secret of all of\nthe world’s most famous storytellers, marketers and creators.\n‘I’m going to have to cut my arm off.’\nFor six days, Aron Ralston kept himself alive with fierce determination,\nawe-inspiring hope and a powerful innate human survival tool – which we\nall have built into our system – that allowed him to tune out of the extreme\npain he was experiencing for long enough to cut his own arm off his body.\nOn a spring day in 2003, Ralston drove alone to Moab, Utah, to\nmountain-bike the dramatic Slickrock Trail and spend a few days solo\nclimbing canyons in preparation for ascending Alaska’s Denali (formerly\nknown as Mount McKinley) later in the year. He climbed into Bluejohn\ncanyon on 26 April, and 5 miles in came to a section where huge boulders\nwere wedged between the walls of the canyon. As he slowly worked his\nway through, he dislodged an 800-pound rock, which slid down and\ncrushed his right hand against the canyon wall.\nNot only was his hand reduced to a bloody mess, but he couldn’t move\nthe boulder. He was stuck. He hadn’t told anyone where he was, had only\nbrought with him a pouch of water and a few snack bars, and wouldn’t be\ndeclared missing for days.\nRalston was trapped."

    "raw_text": "After an agonising period of trying to free his trapped arm and going\nthrough disbelief, shock and despair, he finally composed himself.\nThe cheap multi-use pocketknife that he’d brought with him was his\nonly conceivable path to freedom. Over the next few days, he attempted to\nchip away at the boulder, to no avail. He then tried to chip away at the\ncanyon wall – again, to no avail. Time was running out; he had started with\n3 litres of water and now he was down to 1.\nAs he recalls: ‘I was over the pain, I was over the fear, but I couldn’t get\nover my body’s need for water.’\nRalston had been imprisoned in the canyon for five days. With no other\noption, he resolved to do the unthinkable. With his free hand he assembled\nhis things, took a deep breath, and set about cutting off his arm.\nHe stared momentarily at the dirty blade of his pocket-knife, and then\nplunged it into his trapped arm. The amputation took over an hour, and it\nworked: he was conscious, he was alive, and he was now free.\nExhausted and bloodstained but overcome with relief and adrenaline, he\nmade his way back out of the canyon. After 6 miles, he was met by some\ntourists who led him to safety.\nIt is striking that in Ralston’s own book, and in the film 127 Hours,\nwhich portrays his ordeal, just how curiously unemotional, focused and\ncalm he was about his predicament.\n‘Everything else – the pain, the thought of rescue, the accident itself –\nrecedes. I’m taking action,’ he said.\nThis, while an extreme example, highlights one of the many in-built\nsurvival tools of the human brain: its ability to tune out information that it\ndoesn’t consider to be relevant, so that we can focus on the new and\nunfamiliar information that is more important for our survival and\nwellbeing, even – as in Ralston’s case – if that information comes in the\nform of inconceivable pain, a dire situation or feelings of hopelessness.\nWhen describing parts of his injuries, Ralston remarked in his book:\n‘Perhaps the strangest thing is that I didn’t feel pain from the injury – so\nmany other things were wrong with my circumstances that it wasn’t\nimportant enough to warrant my brain’s attention’."

    "raw_text": "What Ralston is describing is the incredible psychological phenomenon\nof habituation.\nHABITU ATIO N\nHabituation is an in-built neurological device that helps us to focus on\nwhat matters, and tune out of things that our brain doesn’t need to focus on.\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz and\nBuchenwald concentration camps during the Second World War, described\nhow he and his fellow prisoners were exposed to the constant threat of\nviolence and death, as well as the horrific sounds and ghastly smells of the\ncamps. As they spent more time in the camps, their brains underwent\nhabituation: becoming desensitised to the dangers, the sounds, the smells\nand other hardships they faced.\nPavel Fischl, a young Czech poet who arrived in the Nazi-controlled\nTheresienstadt ghetto, described how people there quickly got used to their\nhorrific new surroundings:\nWe have all gotten used to the noise of steps in the barracks’\nhallways. We have already gotten used to those four dark walls\nsurrounding each barracks. We are used to stand[ing] in long lines,\nat 7am, at noon, and again at 7pm, holding a bowl to receive a bit of\nheated water tasting of salt or coffee, or to get a few potatoes. We\nare wont to sleep without beds, live without radio, record player,\ncinema, theatre, and the usual worries of average people. [W]e have\ngotten accustomed to see[ing] people die in their own dirt, to see the\nsick in filth and disgust [ . . . ] we are habituated to wear one shirt\none week long; well, one gets used to everything.\nHabituation is a phenomeno\u0000 in which\nthe brain adjusts to repeated stimuli by\n\f\nignoring or downgrading their\nsignicance.\nFor example, if you are in a room with a constant low-level hum, it might\nannoy you at first, but you probably won’t even notice the sound after a few\nminutes, because your brain has adapted to it and is no longer processing it.\nThis cognitive phenomenon frees up mental capacity that we need for\nother things – new things that might aid in our survival – and it can be\nobserved in any animal with a brain. In one study, researchers put rats in a\nmaze that had chocolate hidden at the end of the maze. They then\nmonitored the rats’ brain activity: ‘The first time the rat entered the maze\nsniffing the air and scratching the walls, its brain exploded with activity, as\nif analysing each new scent, sight, and sound. Although the rat looked calm,\nthe rat’s brain was furiously processing everything.’\nBut once the rat had found the chocolate, when placed back into the\nmaze to find a second piece of chocolate hidden in the same place, the brain\nactivity completely disappeared. The rat was now on autopilot. It no longer\nneeded to process things – it had habituated to the maze – and so it glided\non autopilot straight to the chocolate without pause, in the same way that\nwe all glide unconsciously through our habituated lives, to work, to the gym\nor to a familiar part of our house, without thinking, processing or even\nnoticing familiar environmental information.\nBecause the rat’s brain was now on autopilot, it had freed up cognitive\ncapacity to think about other things. So theoretically, the rat could glide to\nthe chocolate while also pondering a complex problem it was having at\nwork that day. In a world where we didn’t habituate to our environment, our\nbrains might implode from the amount of sensory stimuli it’s required to\nprocess.\nSEM AN TIC SATIATIO N"

Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father.\nHave you ever noticed that if you repeat any word over and over and\nover again, it begins to become just a sound? Even when you look at the\nsame word written repeatedly, as seen above, the brain will eventually tune\nout its meaning. This loss of familiarity sometimes makes a word look like\nit belongs to another language. Stare longer and it may appear as merely a\ncollection of letters, stare even longer and it’ll look like meaningless marks\non the paper.\nYou’ve probably had your own experiences where the repetition of a\nword suddenly made it feel weird, alien and confusing – where you’ve used\na word so frequently that you’ve had to pause for a second, to check the\nword made sense.\nThis is all because of a form of habituation called semantic satiation –\na term coined by Leon James, a professor of psychology at the University\nof Hawaii’s College of Social Sciences – in which the meaning of a word or\nphrase becomes temporarily inaccessible due to repetition and the brain’s\ninclination to tune out of things it doesn’t need to commit resources to.\nThis effect can be seen in our optical senses too. When patients are\ngiven a drug that paralyses their eye muscles, after a few seconds the world\nin front of them will begin to fade away. They haven’t gone to sleep, but the\ninability to move their eye muscles means that the exact same pattern of\nlight is falling on the receptors in the back of the eye, and for all of our\nsenses, when a certain input is constant, we gradually tune out of it by a\nprocess of habituation that cancels out the constant, which in this case is the\nentire visual world. A hand waved in front of their face (or anything\nmoving) would be enough to bring back the patient’s visual world.\nHO W  HABITU ATIO N  HAPPEN S\nNeuroscientist Eugene Sokolov says that that when a stimulus is\nexperienced – words, sounds or even physical sensations – the nervous\n\f\nsystem essentially creates a ‘model’ of what caused it, what it is and how\nthe brain should react to it. With most sensory stimuli, no reaction is\nneeded, so when an unimportant stimulus occurs, the model that the brain\ncreates includes instructions to ignore that stimulus in future.\nFEAR  SLO W S HABITU ATIO N\nWARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING.\nWARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING.\nWARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. WARNING.\nWARNING. WARNING.\n\f\nInterestingly, any word can be affected by semantic satiation, but the\namount of time before words begin to lose their meaning varies. For\nexample, emotive words or those that have dramatic connotations – like\n‘WARNING!’ – appear to lack the satiation effect because our brain draws\nup other strong associations with the word, making it unlikely that its\nmeaning becomes lost.\n \n  \nOf all the facial expressions, those related to threats seem to make the\nbiggest impact. For obvious, survival-orientated reasons, it’s important for\nus to distinguish a threatened face from a calm face. Even at just seven\nmonths old, babies have been shown to pay more attention to fearful faces\nwhen compared with neutral and happy faces.\nHaving A/B tested more than 200 YouTube thumbnails across my\nYouTube channel over the last two years, I’ve consistently found that the\nmore animated, threatening or scary the face on the thumbnail, the more\nclicks the video will get. Neutral faces – which the brain has become\nattuned to ignore and deems ‘wallpaper’ – perform significantly worse in\nterms of clicks, across all channels.\nYO U  BECO M E HABITU ATED  TO  M U SIC AN D\nSO U N D\nOver the years, Leon James showed that semantic satiation is more than just\nsomething that has an impact on things we read: it’s at work on every sight,\nscent and sound in our life.\nIf you’ve got a cat or dog, you may have noticed how easily they seem\nto fall asleep while you’re watching Netflix, talking or blasting music – this\nis due to the same process of habituation. In one study, a loud sound was\nplayed to a sleeping cat, and the cat immediately woke up. But as the sound\nwas played more and more, the cat took a little longer to wake up each time,\n\f\nuntil it just remained sleeping. However, if the tone was varied slightly, the\ncat was immediately awake.\nJames also explored this phenomenon in music. He found that the songs\nthat made it into pop charts the fastest – and thus were played on the radio\nmore often – were also the ones that fell out of the charts the fastest – they\nhad reached habituation. While the songs that slowly climbed the charts to\nthe top spots dropped away just as slowly, fading away versus burning out.\nWith this notion in mind, one might understandably wonder why we\nlike to listen to a song more than once. This question beings me to another\npsychological phenomenon called the ‘mere exposure effect’, referring to\nthe tendency of people to develop a preference for things or people that are\nmore familiar to them, because of repeated exposure.\nIn a 1968 experiment conducted by social psychologist Robert Zajonc,\nparticipants were exposed to a variety of nonsense words, each presented\neither 1, 2, 5, 10 or 25 times. Participants rated words they had heard 5, 10,\nand 25 times as more positive than the ones with 1, or 2 exposures. The\nmere exposure effect has since been proven in several further experiments.\nSo if new things grab our attention, but we like things when they’re\nfamiliar, is it possible that there’s an optimal level of exposure to\nsomething, where it’s both new enough to engage our brain, but old enough\nfor us to like it? The answer is yes, and scientists call it ‘the optimal level\nof exposure’. Creating products that hit that sweet spot of new enough to\ngrab the brain’s attention, but familiar enough to be loved is the plight of\nmost record labels and producers. This is why they will create several\nremixes of a hit song, why new artists sample old-school classics, and why\nmost songs have familiar riffs, sounds and melodies.\n\f\nW E BECO M E HABITU ATED  TO  SM ELLS\nYour brain habituates to smells too; the reason why people often ask the\nfriend stood next to them if they smell is because receptors in their nostrils\nhave become habituated – they can no longer smell their own stench – and\nsignals are no longer being sent from their nasal receptors to their brain.\nIf you’ve ever sampled perfumes in rapid succession, you’ll be familiar\nwith this phenomenon. Perfume sellers will sometimes prompt you to smell\ncoffee beans between samples in an attempt to reduce the effects of this\nnasal habituation.\nIn one habituation study, researchers gave people a bedroom air\nfreshener that dispensed a strong but pleasant pine-like smell, in an equal\nquantity, every day for three weeks. Researchers remarked that ‘every day,\nthe participants became less sensitive to the odor, and they would\nincreasingly ask us, “Are you sure it’s still working!?” ’"

    "raw_text": "HABITU ATIO N  AN D  SEM AN TIC SATIATIO N  IN\nM AR KETIN G\nThere’s irony in the fact that I spent so long reading research on the term\n‘semantic satiation’ – literally thousands of articles, studies and videos –\nthat the term slowly lost its meaning and became wallpaper in my mind.\nOn several occasions, while writing and researching this law, I had to\nstop to double and then triple check I was using the right phrase, because\nmy brain had seemingly become numb, desensitised and unfamiliar with it.\nSimilarly, marketers are rethinking their sales ploys thanks to the new\nresearch on this concept. One timely example is what people are calling\n‘Black Friday numbness’. Thanks to tremendous overuse, ‘Black Friday’ is\nno longer the valuable hook it once was. We’ve repeated it so much that for\nmany, the term has become as indistinct as the wallpaper in their bedroom.\nIn marketing, any word or phrase that is effective will eventually be\nexploited, abused and disempowered. Author and journalist Zachary Petit\nsaid:\nAnother interesting example can be the word ‘revolution’. In 1995,\na journalist colleague of mine and I took up a project after noticing\nthe frequency of the word revolution/revolutionary in press ads. We\nscanned various editions of a newspaper from 1950 till 1995. Our\nfindings indicated that the word ‘revolution’ was only sparsely used\ntill the late 1960s, mainly for actual political revolutions.\nHowever, by the late 1960s, the word was frequently repeated\nby both, left and right mainstream political parties, and even youth\ngroups. Then in a mid-1970s edition of the newspaper, we came\nacross a press ad of a furniture brand that claimed its office chairs\nwere made with ‘revolutionary Swedish technology’. After that we\ncame across ad after ad for electronics, medicines, chocolates, milk,\ncooking oils and detergent brands, all claiming that they were\n‘revolutionary’.\n\f\nA couple of decades later, the word ‘revolution’ had been used so often that\nit lost its meaning, both politically and from a marketing standpoint. Its\npower had effectively vanished.\nBYPASSIN G THE HABITU ATIO N  FILTER\nHere’s a secret that I would like you to keep to yourself in order to avoid\nthe exploitation, overuse and disempowerment of the words.\nWhen I launched my podcast The Diary Of A CEO on YouTube, we\nwere generating millions of monthly views to the channel, but about 70 per\ncent of those that watched the podcast frequently didn’t subscribe. In a lazy\nattempt to get them to subscribe I added the phrase ‘please like and\nsubscribe’ to my introduction, which is the phrase that every YouTube\ncreator I’ve ever watched adopts.\nIt had virtually no impact on my view to subscription rate, and my\nchannel continued its painfully slow trickle of new subscribers. Thinking\nmore deeply about why this might be, I hypothesised that because the\nphrase ‘like and subscribe’ is the default call to action for all creators,\nmaybe viewers’ brains had habituated to it. Maybe that phrase is so\noverused, they didn’t even hear me saying it.\nI crafted a new phrase based on the laws of habituation. In the opening\nseconds of my YouTube videos, I said:\n‘Seventy-four per cent of you that watch this channel frequently do not\nsubscribe.’\n(This is so specific, revealing and thought-provoking that the brain pays\nattention to it, bypassing the habituation filter.)\n‘If you’ve ever enjoyed our videos, please could you do me a favour,\nand hit the subscribe button?’\n(This is a call to reciprocity – a psychological phenomenon that shows\npeople will do something for you if they feel you’ve done something for\nthem.)\n‘It helps this channel more than you know, and the bigger the channel\ngets, the bigger the guests get.’\n\f\n(This is a promise of a future reward – if you subscribe, you’ll be\nrewarded with bigger guests.)\nAfter saying this new ‘call to action’ just once, the channel’s viewer to\nsubscriber rate increased by a staggering 430 per cent! The channel has\nbecome the fastest growing YouTube podcast in the world, outpacing the\nlegendary Joe Rogan. It went from 100,000 subscribers to millions of\nsubscribers in months, and SocialBlade.com forecasts predict it will exceed\n30 million subscribers in the next five years.\n‘Wallpaper’ as I call it – the overuse of popular terms, phrases and calls\nto action to the point that the brain habituates to them and tunes them out –\nis the enemy of effective and successful storytelling and marketing.\nMarketing teams default to using common phrases through laziness, risk-\naversion and a lack of creativity. But this law shows that if you have an\nimportant message and you want to infiltrate the brain’s circuitry, grab its\nattention and be received with meaning, use terminology that is unexpected,\nunusual and unsaturated.\nR EPETITIO N  ISN ’T KEY\nIn marketing, we’re told that repetition is key. A cherished principle in\nmass-media advertising seems to be that the more your customer sees your\nadvert, the more likely they are to act upon it. This is true in principle,\nbecause all learning does depend on the repeated presentation of a certain\nstimulus, but it’s important to understand the conditions that make a\nrepeated stimulation constructive, as in learning, or disruptive, as in\nsatiation.\nIn multiple studies, researchers have found that the relationship between\nfrequency of exposure of an advertising message and its meaningfulness\ncan be represented by an inverted U.\n\f\nThe rising part of the curve (which indicates increase in meaning) is called\n‘semantic generation’ and the descending part (loss of meaning) is\n‘semantic satiation’. The sweet spot for advertisers is where the curve\nchanges inflection. This is where the term, message or phrase has reached\noptimal meaning and effectiveness in the mind of your customer.\nOnce it’s reached this critical point – even if it’s still memorable – it’s\nno longer an effective message to create action, drive sales and evoke an\nemotional response. At this point – if the phrase, words and sounds were\noriginally employed to drive action – it’s time to get creative and think of a\nnew way to pierce the brain’s habituation filter.\nGreat marketing is uncomfortable. It\nsprings a dormant brain into a\nneurol\u0000gical frenzy.\n\f\nStrong marketing demands an opinion, a response and an emotion. It\ndoesn’t want to be liked – it calls for either love or hatred. And once it’s\nfinally reached a point of habituated familiarity, it changes shape, ensnaring\nits audience’s attention once again.\nTHE LAW : AV O ID  W ALLPAPER  AT ALL CO STS\nWords really matter, and the fate of ideas, politicians and brands can be\ndecided by them. Knowing how to communicate in a way that cuts through,\ngrabs attention and beats our habituation filters, will be the difference\nbetween success and failure in many endeavours in our lives. Your brain has\na profound prehistoric survival tool, its habituation filter, which allows it to\nadapt to and tune out of even the most unthinkably painful, annoying or\nsmelly stimulus. In order to be heard, tell stories in an unrepetitive,\nunfiltered and unconventional way.\n\f\nM ake people feel something, either way.\n\f\nLAW  12\nYO U  M U ST PISS PEO PLE O FF\nThis law will explain why pissing people off is an unavoidable consequence\nof building a brand that matters and why ‘hate’ is a signal that you’re\nsaying the right things.\nIn preparation for this book, I wandered through a Barnes & Noble\nbookstore in Los Angeles conducting a bit of observational research on\ntrends within the publishing world. One of the clearest and most striking\nobservations I had was that a huge number of self-help books are now\ncovered in curse words!\nThis trend of swearing on the front cover of books exploded in 2016\nwith Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck – which Manson,\nwho I interviewed in preparation for this book, tells me has sold more than\n15 million copies. It is one of the clearest signs that authors – who are\ncompeting in saturated genres – are trying to avoid ‘semantic satiation’ and\ngrab your brain’s attention by bypassing its ‘wallpaper filter’.\nBy 2018, the top 25 books on Amazon’s bestseller list included – as\nwell as The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck – books titled What the F*@#\nShould I Make for Dinner?, 50 Ways to Eat Cock, Unf*ck Yourself and\nCalm the F**k Down. Archive data shows that ten years ago, none of the\nbooks at the top of the charts had a profanity in their title.\nSarah Knight’s editor Michael Szczerban – who published several of her\ncuss-covered, multi-million copy selling books, including Calm the F**k\nDown, said:"

    "raw_text": "Publishers and authors are trying to find ways to cut through all the\nnoise and reach people. This seems to be one way that some books\ncan do that, and when that happens, other people try to follow in\nthose footsteps. Some people don’t like it, some retailers don’t want\nto carry a book because it has a swear word on the title. But the\nupside more than wins out.\nWhen he says, ‘but the upside wins out’, he’s touching on one of the most\nfoundational principles of marketing, avoiding semantic satiation, and being\nheard.\nIt’s a principle that all my marketing teams have exploited, preached\nabout and executed for more than a decade, so much so that we wrote it on\nour office walls: ‘Make people feel something – either way.’\nIndiﬀerence - when people don’t love you\nor hate you - is the least protable\noutcome for a marketer.\nIndifference to your words, your message or your calls to action is the\nsurest path to the dreaded habituation filter mentioned in the previous law.\nI interviewed Jane Wurwand, the illustrious founder and chief visionary\nof Dermalogica and The International Dermal Institute. Wurwand is one of\nthe most recognised and respected authorities in the beauty industry. Under\nher leadership, Dermalogica has grown to be a leading skincare brand, used\nby more than 100,000 skin therapists in more than 100 countries around the\nworld, and consequently she’s become one of the richest women in the\nbeauty industry.\nHer number one marketing secret to avoid her customers’ habituation\nfilter is to say things and do things that ‘piss people off’. She explained:\n\f\nWe have to be prepared to piss off 80 per cent or we’ll never turn on\n20 per cent. If we don’t, we’ll be middle of the road, mediocre,\naverage, palatable, but not definable. That’s a product. That’s not a\nbrand. A brand triggers an emotional response. And so that became\nour watchword in marketing: ‘We need to piss off 80 per cent and\nturn on 20 per cent.’ We don’t need everyone to like us. And if\nwe’re not being slightly disruptive, then everyone’s going to like us,\nbut they’re not going to love us. If some people hate us, some\npeople will love us.\nBut be wary; all emotional tactics have a shelf life – emotional hooks have\ndiminishing returns as the brain habituates and downgrades it’s meaning.\nWhen comparing the chart dominance of cuss-covered books between\n2018 and now, it’s clear that the effectiveness of this swearing tactic is\nstarting to wane. The thing that makes any emotional messaging effective,\nultimately makes it popular, which by the power of habitation quickly turns\nit into wallpaper.\nTHE LAW : YO U  M U ST PISS PEO PLE O FF\nDon’t be afraid of alienating people with emotional, bold or even divisive\nmarketing approaches – triggering an emotional response that engages 20\nper cent of your audience and enrages 80 per cent can be more valuable\nthan an approach to which 100 per cent is indifferent.\n\f\nSome people will love you.\nSome people will hate you.\nSome people simply  \nwon’t care.\nYou will only connect to the rst two.\nBut not to the third.\nIndiﬀerence is the least protable\noutcome."

    "raw_text": "LAW  13\nSHO O T YO U R  PSYCHO LO GICAL M O O N SHO TS\nFIR ST\nThis law will show you how to create huge perceived value in your\ncustomers’ minds with shockingly tiny, often free, superficial changes to\nyour product and it reveals the psychological tricks your favourite brands\nare using on you right now.\nMy hairdresser has been manipulating me for three years.\nHe comes to my house at the same time on the same day, every week,\nand delivers the same haircut. I’ve stuck with him because I’ve always\nbelieved he has the greatest attention to detail, he’s a perfectionist, and so\nI’ve always trusted him to cut my hair.\nOne day, on one of his routine visits, we had our first ever issue. After\nfinishing my haircut, he took the apron off me and announced, ‘You’re\ndone, mate.’\nInstinctively, something just didn’t feel right to me. For a reason I\ncouldn’t quite articulate, it felt as if he had rushed my haircut, and like he\nhadn’t paid his usual attention to detail.\nI replied, ‘Really? That was quick!’ I dubiously walked over to my\nkitchen mirror and began to examine my scalp in search of the patch that he\nmust have missed. Surprisingly, the haircut was perfect, as usual.\nStill believing he had rushed the haircut, I walked over to my phone to\ncheck the time – he’d spent the same amount of time cutting my hair as he\ndid every week.\n\f\nConfused as to why I felt so inexplicably short-changed, I said to him,\n‘For some reason that felt really rushed.’ For a moment he looked back at\nme totally confused, and then, as if struck by a hilarious joke, he burst into\nan uncontrollable fit of laughter. ‘My bad, my bad, mate; because we were\ntalking so much, I forget to do my “end-of-trim routine”!’ he explained.\nEnd-of-trim routine? He went on to tell me about a psychological trick\nhe calls ‘one last snip’, which he’s been using on me and all his clients for\nthe last ten years.\nHe said he’s noticed that clients always feel like he’s done a better job if\nat the end of the haircut he pretends to inspect their finished haircut before\ndoing one last – fictitious – snip.\nSo at the end of every haircut – including all of my previous haircuts –\nhe’s done an ‘end-of-trim routine’ that involves turning off the electrical\nhair clippers, taking a long pause, walking around the client as if inspecting\ntheir hair closely, and then pretending to do one tiny final snip on their hair,\nbefore announcing that he’s done.\nToday, he had simply forgotten this little routine, and I had instinctively\nfelt it. I felt that my haircut was worse, rushed or negligent because he had\nsimply forgotten a ten-second psychological trick which had subconsciously\nconvinced me he has tremendous attention to detail.\nIn reality, his ‘one last snip’ trick does nothing to improve my hair – he\nadmitted he doesn’t even cut any hair during this routine, but it does a lot to\nimprove my perception that he’s done a thorough job. This is the power of a\n‘psychological moonshot’, a term coined by Ogilvy’s Rory Sutherland.\nA psychol\u0000gical moonshot is a relatively\nsmall investment that drastically\nimproves the perception of something.\nPsychological moonshots prove that it’s nearly always cheaper, easier and\nmore effective to invest in perception than reality.\n\f\nU BER  IS A PSYCHO LO GICAL M O O N SHO T\n‘What if you could request one on your phone?’\nThat’s the question Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp asked each other\none freezing night in Paris. They were over from the United States for a\ntech conference, waiting endlessly for a cab, experiencing a misery many of\nus will be familiar with: not knowing if, or when, your cab is coming sucks.\nThe simple question they asked that night, borne from uncertainty and\nfrustration, would lead to the creation of Uber, now the default taxi app for\nmore than 100 million people every month, in 600 cities and 65 countries.\nIn high-stress situations, when we’re late for a flight, a meeting or an\nevent, every second feels like a minute, every minute feels like an hour and\nevery hour feels like a day. The feelings of angst this scenario creates is one\nwe can all relate to; this is the awful anxiety of customer uncertainty.\nReducing their customers’ psychological friction became Uber’s key\nchallenge, and so they launched an entire in-house team of behavioural\n(data) scientists, psychologists and neuroscientists in what would be called\n‘Uber Labs’.\nIn their research, Uber Labs discovered several key psychological\nprinciples that impact a customer’s satisfaction with Uber and their\nperceptions of the overall experience: the peak–end rule, idleness aversion,\noperational transparency, uncertainty anxiety and the goal-gradient effect.\nUnderstanding these five powerful psychological forces allowed Uber to\ncompletely redesign an entire industry and create a business valued at $120\nbillion.\n1. THE PEAK-EN D  R U LE: THE TW O  M O M EN TS THAT M ATTER\nM O ST\nThe peak–end rule is a cognitive bias that describes how people remember\nan experience or event. Simply put, we judge an experience according to\nhow we felt at its peak and at its end, rather than by some perfectly\naggregated average of every moment of it. Crucially, this applies to both\ngood and bad experiences! Businesses and brands take note: customers will\n\f\njudge their entire experience on just two moments – the best (or worst)\npart, and the end.\nThis perspective helps us to understand why a terrible flight at the start\nof a holiday has less negative impact on satisfaction than a terrible flight at\nthe end of a holiday. Why a wonderful dinner can be tainted by a surprise\nsurcharge on the bill, and why a two-minute disagreement at the end of a\npositive date night with your spouse will taint your memory of the whole\nevening.\nIt also explains why Uber drivers are trained to be exceptionally kind to\nyou at the end of a ride, moments before you rate them and offer them a tip.\n2. IDLEN ESS AV ER SIO N : O U R  NEED  FO R  JU STIFIABLE\nBU SYN ESS\nUber Labs cited research that people who are busy are happier than\npeople who are idle – even if they are not busy of their own volition (i.e.,\nyou’ve coerced them into some activity). In fact, even a false justification –\na spurious reason – can motivate people to action, such is our appetite for\ndistraction and activity. The implications of this research are that many of\nthe ‘goals’ we pursue are really just excuses to keep ourselves busy.\nFor Uber, this meant that if they could keep waiting customers busy by\ngiving them something to watch or to engage with, those customers would"

This, in part, explains why restaurants bring you freebies\nwhile you wait, why streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube play\npreviews when you hover over videos, and why Google Chrome installed a\nT-rex game that appears when you lose connection.\nStudies show keeping your customer busy can improve customer\nhappiness, retention and conversion by more than 25 per cent!\n3. O PER ATIO N AL TR AN SPAR EN CY: BR AN D S SHO U LD  BE\nGLASS BO XES\nGetting a cab back in 2008 came with a lot of uncertainty. A customer had\nno way of knowing when their taxi would arrive (or even if it would arrive),\nwho was picking them up, or why it was taking so long. Back then, if you\ngot into a cab without a meter, the driver would effectively pluck the price\nout of the air, based on their own guesstimate. Even when you got in a cab\nwith a meter, you’d worry that the driver was intentionally taking a longer\nroute to increase the fare.\nThis lack of transparency is poison to customer experience; it breeds\ndistrust, and distrust makes us sceptical, resentful and disloyal to a brand.\nGiven these insights, Uber Labs used a psychology principle called\noperational transparency and began explaining each step going on behind\nthe scenes to show the rate of progress during the wait. They included the\narrival time estimate calculation, gave a detailed breakdown of how the fare\nwas calculated, justified estimates for everything and provided quick\nupdates – with an explanation – when something changed.\n\f\nThese changes resulted in an 11 per cent reduction in the post-request\ncancellation rate, which to Uber, with more than 7 billion trips taken per\nyear, is a multi-billion-dollar improvement.\n4. U N CER TAIN TY AN XIETY\nIn 2008, Domino’s Pizza experienced an interesting operational and\ncustomer experience challenge. Customers who were waiting longer than\nthey expected for their pizza would phone Domino’s to ask where it was.\nThe whole process of pizza making would then be interrupted, because the\nperson making the pizza would be asked why there was a delay by the\nperson who’d answered the phone, and the customer would ultimately be\ngiven a vague and uncertain answer. A calling customer was unwittingly\ndelaying the delivery of their own pizza, because of the lack of operational\ntransparency they’d been given.\nSome pizza chains responded to this challenge by investing in warming\nbags to keep the pizzas hot, hiring more staff and drivers, launching money-\nback guarantees on delivery times and offering free breadsticks for slow\ndeliveries, but their phones carried on ringing.\nWhat they were all missing was the psychological frustration at the\nheart of the problem – people didn’t want faster delivery – they wanted\nless uncertainty about their delivery.\nDomino’s understood this, and in 2008, using their pre-existing in-house\norder-management software, they created the now famous ‘Domino’s Pizza\nTracker’, which shows customers exactly where their order is in a five-step\nprocess.\nThis small psychological insight and the innovation it produced changed\nDomino’s business. Angry phone calls plummeted, customer satisfaction\nand retention skyrocketed and Domino’s saved and made hundreds of\nmillions in the process.\nResearch published in the journal Nature showed that it’s less\npsychologically stressful to know something negative is about to happen\n(e.g., our pizza is going to be 30 minutes late) than to be left in uncertainty\n(e.g., we have no idea where the late pizza is).

As Rory Sutherland explains in his\nbook Alchemy, a ‘DELAYED’ alert on your scheduled flight is much more\nmentally irritating than a ‘DELAYED 50 MINUTES’ alert.\n \n  \nEvery day, more than 300 Shinkansen (bullet) trains arrive and depart\nTokyo Station’s four platforms, at an average interval of roughly four\nminutes. The trains only stop at the station for ten minutes and it takes two\nminutes for the passengers to disembark and three minutes for new\npassengers to board.\n‘TESSEI’, a subsidiary of Japan Railway, is in charge of cleaning these\nbullet trains, making them hygienic for the more than 400,000 passengers\nthat use the service every day. Customers would often complain about the\ncleanliness and hygiene of these trains, in light of these fast turnaround\ntimes – assuming the trains couldn’t possibly be properly cleaned in such a\nshort window of time.\nTeruo Yabe, TESSEI’s CEO, wanted to change this perception; he\nbelieved that the trains were in fact very clean – but some customers didn’t\nhave enough visibility to believe it. So instead of hiring more cleaners,\nYabe decided to make the cleaners stand out: he changed the colour of\nemployee uniforms from pale blue shirts to unmissable bright red jackets,\nand he asked cleaners to put on a show – which is now internationally\nknown as the ‘seven-minute Shinkansen theatre’ – to greet incoming and\noutgoing customers.\nAs the train pulls into the platform, cleaners line up by the doors and\nbow as it pulls in. Holding open bags, they greet the arriving passengers and\nthank them for handing over their rubbish. Staff then whizz through the\ntrain, picking up rubbish, sweeping and sanitising surfaces, and once\ncomplete, the cleaners line up by the train and perform a second bow to\nshow respect for the departing train and its new passengers."

What would become known as the ‘7-\nminute miracle’ repositioned the train line as being one of the cleanest in\nthe world.\nThis shows that even hygiene uncertainty can be rectified with a\npsychological moonshot, and offers further evidence that it’s nearly always\ncheaper, easier and more effective to invest in perception than reality.\n5. THE GO AL-GR AD IEN T EFFECT: SPEED IN G U P N EAR  THE\nFIN ISH LIN E\nIn 1932, a behavioural scientist named Clark Hull was studying rats in a\nmaze. Using sensors attached to the rats, he monitored their speed as they\nran towards a food reward. Hull observed that the nearer the rats came to\nthe end of the maze – and its accompanying prize – the faster they moved.\nHe called this principle ‘the goal-gradient effect’.\nIt’s been repeatedly proven that what\nmotivates us most is how close we are to\nachieving a goal: we work faster the closer\nwe are to success.\nParticipants collecting stamps as part of a café’s reward programme buy\ncoffee more frequently the closer they get to earning a free drink; internet\nusers who rate songs in return for gift certificates rate more songs as they\napproach the reward goal, and LinkedIn users are more likely to add profile\ninformation if they’re shown a ‘profile strength’ bar that details how close\nthey are to completing their profile.\n\f\nUber Labs solved this problem with the design of their map, which goes\nto great lengths to emphasise just how close the car is from arriving at both\nthe pick-up and the destination.\nAll of these psychological hacks have made Uber the most famous taxi\ncompany in the world, dominating their industry internationally. And\nbecause of the work done by the psychology experts in Uber Labs, the\ncompany now says it only takes 2.7 rides before someone becomes a\npermanent customer.\nTHE PO W ER  O F PSYCHO LO GICAL\nM O O N SHO TS\nThe term moonshot is derived from the Apollo 11 spaceflight project, which\nlanded the first human – Neil Armstrong – on the moon in 1969, and which\nwas described by Armstrong as ‘a giant leap for mankind’. A psychological\nmoonshot, is a giant leap forward using the power of psychology.\nWhen I interviewed Rory Sutherland, he said:\nIt’s hard to increase customer satisfaction by making a train ten\ntimes faster; it’s much easier to increase customer satisfaction by\nusing psychological principles to make it feel ten times more\nenjoyable. I don’t think governments like the UK government\nwould need to spend £50 billion on faster trains if they just made\nthe Wi-Fi work better while you’re on it. It seems likely that the\nbiggest progress in the next 50 years won’t come from\nimprovements in technology, but in psychology and design thinking.\nRemarkably, the ‘close’ button in most lifts doesn’t actually work. Lift\ndoors are designed to close after a certain amount of time, for safety and\nlegal reasons. According to Karen Penafiel, former executive director of\nNational Elevator Industry Inc., ‘The riding public cannot make elevator\ndoors close any faster.’ But this illusionary placebo creates the impression"

    "raw_text": "LAW  14\nFR ICTIO N  CAN  CR EATE V ALU E\nThis law will show you the counterintuitive truth that sometimes your\ncustomers will want your products more  . . . if you make their experience\nworse.\nDuring my time as a marketing CEO, I sat in numerous brand marketing\nmeetings with our client Coca-Cola where their marketing executives were\nseemingly dumbfounded by the success of Red Bull and the wider energy\ndrink industry.\nSugary drink sales were plummeting, yet the equally unhealthy, rancid-\ntasting energy drinks category was skyrocketing. What was making one\ncategory grow so much more successfully than the other? Our research\nrevealed that customers in different categories had different expectations,\nand with different expectations come different psychological moonshots.\nIn my conversation with Rory Sutherland, he pointed out that Red Bull\ndelivers on its psychological expectation of enhancing your performance\nand ‘giving you wings’ by intentionally making it taste bad. Because it\ntastes more like medicine than a pleasant fizzy drink, they’ve convinced\ntheir customers that it’s packed with powerful, effective chemicals. Making\nthings taste ‘better’ can make them less desirable – depending on\nexpectations.\nOne of my closest friends founded and ran one of the fastest-growing\nperformance nutrition brands in Europe. He often confessed to me that the\nbiggest product challenge they had was that their products tasted so good\n\f\nthat customers simply didn’t believe they were good for them. At one point,\nthey had seriously considered making products taste worse in an attempt to\nincrease sales.\nThese examples prove that making things\neasier isn’t necessarily the path to a\npsychol\u0000gical moonshot; sometimes you\nhave to do the opposite: increase friction,\nwait times and inconvenience, to achieve\nthe same increase in perceived value.\nGeneral Mills launched several cake mixes in the 1950s under the famous\nBetty Crocker brand. To make the cake, you had to add water, mix it and\nbake it. It was a foolproof cake mix. It included powdered milk and eggs\nand was impossible to get wrong. When the cakes were launched,\nexpectations were high. But the product didn’t take off and reception was\nlukewarm at best.\nGeneral Mills didn’t understand what had gone wrong. It had wanted to\nsave time for busy wives and mothers, but somehow that had fallen flat. It\nhired a team of psychologists to investigate. Their conclusion was that\nalthough the product saved time and effort compared to making a cake from\nscratch, American wives and homemakers felt guilty about the assumption\nthat they had spent hours baking when they hadn’t, or about having to admit\nthat they had taken a shortcut and hadn’t put the work in, so they went back\nto traditional baking.\nGeneral Mills might have considered an advertising campaign to\naddress the issue but, driven by psychology, they went in another direction\n– against all marketing conventional wisdom and towards a psychological\nmoonshot. They took the egg out of the mix and printed ‘Add an egg’ on\n\f\nthe front of the package. This ‘subtraction technique’ caused more friction,\nmade the product less convenient and cost its customers more time –\nobjectively resulting in a less valuable product – but in doing so it made the\nbaker feel more valuable themselves, and consequently sales soared.\nSimilarly, every time a restaurant brings me a raw steak and a hot stone to\ncook it on, it’s clear to me that they’re intentionally or unintentionally\nemploying a powerful psychologic moonshot.\nEveryone’s steak preference is notoriously specific – meaning steaks are\none of the most returned food items to even the most high-end kitchens. It\nappears illogical that asking a customer to cook their own food might\nincrease their satisfaction and perception of value of the overall experience,\nbut that’s precisely what happens when a hot stone is presented.\nBy bringing the meat raw, they’re bringing down my wait time, saving\ntheir chefs time, increasing my chances of satisfaction by allowing me to\ncook my own steak the way I like it (medium rare), giving me a sense of\nhaving invested effort in my meal, reducing complaints and returns and\navoiding customer idleness by keeping me busy. In this psychological\n\f\nmoonshot, operational transparency, idleness aversion and the goal-gradient\neffect are all at work at the same time!\nFlight, hotel and insurance aggregator websites understand that friction can\ncreate value. They found that faster search times on their websites often\nresulted in fewer sales.

    "raw_text": "LAW  15\nTHE FR AM E M ATTER S M O R E THAN  THE\nPICTU R E\nThis law explains how the way a product is presented to consumers\ndrastically affects their perception of its value.\nA single, trivial mistake shattered my love affair with my favourite brand.\nYou would typically find me covered in this one particular brand of\nclothing from head to toe. A few years ago, I fell for the brand after\ndiscovering the founder’s story, his vision, his unrelenting devotion to\ndetail, creativity, artistic flair, and the technical wizardry he poured into\neach masterpiece. This brand crafted one-of-a-kind designs for everyday\nwear, all at a rather premium price point.\nOne fateful day, as I casually scrolled through social media, I stumbled\nupon a video the founder had posted. In it, he toured the production line in\nChina where his creations came to life. The video aimed to flaunt the vast\nscale of the operation and the meteoric rise of the brand by illustrating how\nmany products were being made, how they made them, and the process that\ngoverned the production line.\nIn that very instant, the spell was broken; the enchanting illusion the\nbrand had cast over me evaporated.\nIt wasn’t the fact that the brand was produced in China, nor the faces of\nthe workers creating the clothes, or even the conditions of the production\nline that jolted me. Rather, it was the sight of the very shoes I was wearing\nas I watched the video, regurgitated from a monstrous machine and tossed\n\f\ninto a heap of thousands of identical pairs. It was the sight of the exact T-\nshirt I had on at that moment, haphazardly piled atop thousands of others in\na gargantuan, dumpster-like container, with a cascade of shirts spilling over\nthe edge like an overflowing rubbish bin.\nAlthough the brand never explicitly made such claims, my infatuated\nmind had always perceived their products to be unique works of art, each\nlovingly handcrafted by the devoted founder himself. Logically, I would\nhave guessed that mass production must have been involved somewhere,\nbut these things aren’t governed by logic – they’re stories we choose to\nbelieve based on the evidence presented to us. Up until then, the only\nnarrative the brand had woven was one of artistry, exclusivity and romance.\nThe way that something is packaged has a\nbig impact on how it’s received. How\nsomething is framed aﬀects how\nconsumers perceive and value the brand.\nIn this moment, the frame of my\nfavourite brand changed irreversibly.\nThis isn’t a recent behavioural discovery. The famous Pepsi Challenge\ncampaigns of the 1970s required customers to blind taste Pepsi and Coca-\nCola out of plain white cups and their branded cans and bottles. People\npreferred Pepsi when they were drinking it from the cups but, surprisingly,\nthey preferred Coca-Cola when it was served in the bottle or can. The\nframing of the drink actually changed how it tasted to the consumer.\nIf you go into your local electronics store, you’ll likely find yourself in\nan overwhelming jungle of wires, gadgets and batteries stacked on top of\neach other from floor to ceiling. Conventional thought in product\nmerchandising was that the more items you displayed, the more chance\n\f\nyou’d have of making a sale. This is a very logical way of thinking, but\nApple knows that humans are anything but logical, and that there are other\ndominant psychological forces that matter much more.\nEvery Apple Store in the world evokes the astonishing power of\nframing to unconsciously persuade shoppers that spending several\nthousands of dollars on a small electronic gadget – like an iPhone – is worth\nit.\nThey’ve designed their stores to feel more like art galleries – known for\ntheir high-value, unique pieces – than a cluttered electronic retailer. Their\nbehavioural scientists know that the frame they create will sway the value\nof the gadget within it. By displaying only a small quantity of their items,\nthey evoke the power of scarcity – a form of framing – which dictates that\ndemand, and therefore the perceived value of a product, is increased when\nsupply appears limited. We all intuitively know retail space is expensive,\nand so by giving each individual Apple product lots of empty space around\nit, they’re signalling that each item is so valuable that it warrants that\nexpense. Psychologically we pour the value of the free space around the\nproduct into the product itself – like a piece of art. Apple frame their\nproducts on an alluring psychological stage.\nTo illustrate how powerful the frame around something can be on\naltering perception, check out this visual example:\nI’m an investor in, and ambassador for, a company called WHOOP, a\nhealth-monitoring wearable that tracks your key health metrics. The\ncompany was recently valued at $3.6 billion, it dominates its category and\nits customers include everyone from Cristiano Ronaldo to LeBron James\nand Michael Phelps."

    "raw_text": "The lines between the two arrowheads are the same length\nIt has won in a category packed with giants and their colossal marketing\nbudgets – Apple, Fitbit, Garmin – in part because of their genius focus on\nframing.\nThe CEO of WHOOP told me that the company has continually resisted\nall calls to add a time display to their wristband, despite how easy it would\nbe to implement, for this very reason. WHOOP is now the only leading\nhealth wearable or wristband in its category that has no screen and doesn’t\nshow its wearer the time.\nWhy? Because they believe adding a screen would change the\ncustomer’s perception of the device from being an elite health device that\nathletes use, to a watch. Adding something that is objectively valuable – the\nability to know the time – would decrease the psychological value of the\nproduct. In the world of psychological moonshots, less is so often more, and\none word, tweak or decision can make a huge difference to the perception\nof a product’s value.\nIn 2019, I advised a large global B2B company to ban the job title\n‘salesperson’, to stop using the term ‘sales’ and replace it with a\n‘partnerships’ team. More people responded to their emails, and their sales\nrose by 31 per cent. As I suspected, a job title with the word ‘sales’ in it,\nprimes the people you contact to believe you’re going to pester them to buy"

    "raw_text": "something they don’t want – conversely, the framing of the word ‘partner’\nsuggests the person is on your team.\n \n  \nA few years ago, Elon Musk made a promise to animal rights associations:\nno more leather in Tesla cars. The entrepreneur has kept his word and,\nstarting with the Tesla Model 3, its cars’ interiors have been made of what\nis curiously called ‘vegan leather’.\nRory Sutherland, the advertising legend that coined the phrase\n‘psychological moonshot’, told me that Tesla instinctively understand the\npowerful impact of psychological moonshots on the perception of value:\ninstead of calling its new car seats ‘plastic’ – which they are – they eagerly\nclung on to the word ‘leather’ and its luxury connotations to maintain the\nperceived value of their cars’ upholstery. Framing like this is one of the\nmost common ways people achieve psychological moonshots, without\nimproving the reality of a product or experience at all.\nFraming isn’t about lying and deception;\nit’s about knowing how to present your\nproduct or service through the most\nfactual and compelling lens.\nFor example, it’s more appealing to say a food product is 90 per cent lean\nthan to say it contains 10 per cent fat. Both are true, but one frame is more\npsychologically alluring.\nThese examples illustrate an important but too often forgotten principle\nin branding, marketing and business: reality is nothing more than\nperception and context is king.\n\f\nTHE LAW : THE FR AM E M ATTER S M O R E\nTHAN  THE PICTU R E\nWhat you say, is not all that you say. What you say is determined by the\ncontext in which your message, product or service exists. If you change the\nframe, you change your message. Your customers will hear everything –\nincluding the things you didn’t say. Don’t just focus on what you say, focus\non how the frame around what you’re trying to say is positively or\nnegatively distorting your message.\n\f\nA smart frame will transform the plain."

    "raw_text": "LAW  16\nU SE GO LD ILO CKS TO  YO U R  ADV AN TAGE\nThis law shows you the powerful yet simple sales trick that you can use to\nmake the thing you’re selling appear to be better value, without changing\nthe price.\n‘Why does he want to show me properties that I’m not interested in?’ I\nasked my PA, Sophie, as she read out the itinerary for my house-viewing\ntrip with my estate agent, Clive, scheduled for the following day. ‘I’m not\nsure; he insists that you see a variety of options,’ she replied.\nA few days later, I submitted an offer to purchase the second of the\nthree properties that Clive had shown me. Thank you, Clive.\nBut that’s not the end of the story; some months later, while researching\ndifferent psychological tricks brands and marketers deploy to influence our\nbehaviour, I stumbled across something called the Goldilocks effect.\nThe Goldilocks effect is a type of ‘anchoring’.\nAnchoring is a cognitive bias where\nindividuals rely too heavily on seemingly\nirrelevant information (the ‘anchor’)\nwhen making decisions.\n\f\nIn the context of the Goldilocks effect, by presenting two ‘extreme’ options\nnext to the option you’re hoping to sell, you can make the middle option\nappear more attractive or reasonable.\nIn most contexts the ‘true’ value of something is nothing more than\nopinion – so we search for cues within context and pricing to help us make\nour decisions; when the Goldilocks effect is in play, we perceive the most\nexpensive option as an excessive luxury. In contrast, we see the cheapest\noption as risky, insufficient and lower quality, and in the middle we have\nwhat we assume is the best option – we believe it must have the combined\nbenefits of the other two: it’s a safe bet, cost-efficient and of good quality.\nReflecting on the property viewings I’d had with Clive, I realised that I\nhad only asked him to show me the second property, but he had insisted on\nshowing me three. The first property he showed me was far too small and\narguably overpriced. The second property was spacious and only slightly\nmore expensive than the first, while the third property was extremely\nexpensive, in the same area, and seemed to be vastly overpriced. Like a\npuppet under Clive’s control, I, of course, instantly chose to make an offer\non the second property.\nCurious to know if Clive had intentionally manipulated me, I sent him a\ntext asking if he was familiar with the Goldilocks effect. He replied first\nwith a laughing face and a wink, and then went on to say, ‘Never show\npeople only one option!’\nCrafty #@$%.\nClive isn’t the only person, brand or organisation using the Goldilocks\neffect to influence your behaviour. Panasonic utilised it in 1992, by offering\na $199.99 premium microwave as well as its existing microwaves at\n$179.99 and $109.99. Sales of what then became the mid-priced option –\nthe $179.99 microwave – skyrocketed, which pushed Panasonic up to a 60\nper cent market share!\n\f\nAn experiment asked participants to choose between an all-inclusive\nholiday to Paris or an all-inclusive holiday to Rome. Paris won.\nBut then a second survey was run, this time adding an option for a holiday\nto Rome that’s all-inclusive for everything except coffee. The totally all-\ninclusive deal to Rome wasn’t just more popular than the version without\ncoffee, it was also more popular than the all-inclusive trip to Paris.\nWith little information provided, the brain will search for context cues\nabout the value of the three options. The presence of the ‘Rome without\ncoffee’ option provides one such cue, and implies that the Rome trip is so\nvaluable that they removed something from it, because it is such a good\ndeal.\nTo make the Goldilocks effect work, brands usually price the medium\noption higher than the lowest price, but far away from the most expensive\nprice. For example, an airline selling return flights to New York would\ncharge £800 for economy, £2,000 for business class and £8,000 for first\n\f\nclass. Many customers will perceive the £2,000 ticket as the best value,\neven though it’s clearly not the best price.\nEverything described in the psychological moonshot law serves to\nhighlight a fundamental fallacy that drives how we tell stories and deliver\nexperiences: we believe that we’re rational – the cognitive dissonance\ncreated every time I tell you that your decisions don’t make sense is\nevidence of that – so when we create marketing for others we assume they\nare too and so we lean towards the hard work of improving reality, instead\nof the easier task of leveraging psychology.\nO ur decisions aren’t driven by sense,\nthey’re driven by the no\u0000sense created by\nsocial cues, irrational fear and survival\ninstincts.\nGreat marketers, storytellers and brand-builders understand that pursuing a\npsychological moonshot isn’t a malevolent, unethical or disingenuous\nundertaking. It’s fair that these psychological perceptions work against you\nto create shortcuts to unfavourable perceptions – so it’s also fair that you\nhave a chance to use the same forces to turn these words, contexts, stigmas\nand perceptions in your favour, creating shortcuts to a perception that\nallows the world to see a truer representation of the true beauty, value and\nimportance of the things you’ve created.\nAll is fair in psychological moonshots.\nTHE LAW : U SE GO LD ILO CKS TO  YO U R\nADV AN TAGE\nPeople are inclined to make value judgements based on context, so offering\na range of options – including an economy, standard and premium version\n\f\nof your product – can tell a story and affect potential customers’ perception\nof your standard offering.\n\f\nThe context creates the value.\n\f\nLAW  17\nLET THEM  TRY AND  THEY W ILL BU Y\nThis law reveals the easiest way to get someone to love a product instantly.\n‘No, Uncle Steven! It’s mine!’ my niece exclaimed, her eyes brimming with\ntears, as I sheepishly asked her to return the Christmas present I had just\ngiven her.\nIn the frenzy of wrapping presents for my entire family, including my\nniece and nephew, I had made the rookie mistake of neglecting to label each\ngift with the recipient’s name. Consequently, I had inadvertently presented\nmy niece with a toy figurine of Buzz Lightyear – my nephew’s all-time\nfavourite character. I was now on the verge of watching my nephew unwrap\na present containing an Elsa doll – the apple of my niece’s eye.\nThe room fell silent as I fumbled for words, attempting to rectify the\nsituation. My niece clutched Buzz Lightyear to her chest, her eyes\nnarrowing with fierce determination. ‘But  . . . but,’ I stammered, ‘you see,\nthere’s been a tiny mix-up. Buzz is actually meant for your brother!’\nThe tension in the room was palpable as my niece’s eyes darted between\nme and her treasured toy. My nephew, sensing the drama unfolding before\nhim, froze mid-unwrapping, craning his neck to get a better view of the\nspectacle.\nI conceded defeat.\n‘All right, you keep it.’ I wasn’t prepared to negotiate with the steely\nresolve of a tearful three-year-old girl – the drama simply wasn’t worth it.\n\f\nTo my surprise, my nephew, who had now unwrapped his brand-new\nElsa doll, seemed content too. He didn’t complain, made no attempt to\nswap, and he clutched the doll with the same fondness that his sister held\nher new Buzz Lightyear toy. They both adored what they had been given,\nbut I knew if I had given them both a choice in the toy shop, they would\nhave opted for the other toy.\nThis Christmas present wrapping blunder taught me a powerful\npsychological lesson about a phenomenon behavioural psychologists call\n‘the endowment effect’. The endowment effect is a cognitive bias that\ncauses people to overvalue an item simply because they own it, regardless\nof its objective value. In other words, individuals tend to be much more\nattached to items they believe they own than they are to similar objects they\ndo not possess. This is a potent psychological trick that brands deploy on all\nof us, all the time.\n\f\nApple is one such brand: every store provides an interactive experience\nfor customers, with all products displayed openly and touchable.\nMoreover, they insist that every device on the floor is plugged into a\npower supply, loaded with apps and connected to the internet, and they tilt\nall the screens to the exact same angle in order to attract more potential\nexperiences. They rigorously train staff not to press customers to buy\n(ensured by the fact that floor staff don’t earn sales commissions) or to ask\ncustomers to leave, thus offering an unlimited time to play with the\nproducts.\nIn their ‘One to One’ workshops, the aim is to empower the customer to\nfind the solutions themselves; they do not touch the computer without the\ncustomer’s permission.\nThis might just sound like kindness or good manners, but I assure you\nit’s something much more calculated. Apple is evoking the power of two\nsubconscious psychological spells – the mere exposure effect we saw in\nLaw 11, which increases a fondness for the product by increasing consumer\nexposure to the product, and the endowment effect, which increases a\nproduct’s perceived value by giving a consumer possession of the product.\nPut simply, the mere exposure effect makes you like it more, and the\nendowment effect makes you value it more highly.\nApple believes that creating an ‘ownership experience’ is more\npowerful than driving a hard sell. The multisensory experiences built into\nApple Stores deliver exactly that.\nSo powerful, in fact, that the Illinois state attorney general’s office\nissued a warning to holiday shoppers in 2003 to be careful of holding\nproducts as if they were their own when shopping. Although this warning\nsounds slightly bizarre, the basis of it is supported by 30 years of research.\nIn a 2009 study conducted by the University of Wisconsin, groups of\nstudents were asked to evaluate two products: a Slinky toy and a mug. In\nthe first experiment one group was allowed to touch the items and the other\ngroup wasn’t. In the next experiment one group was allowed to imagine\nthey owned the item, and the other group wasn’t. Extraordinarily, touching\n\f\nthe items or even just imagining you owned it increased the participants’\nvalue estimates.\nApple’s strategy of allowing customers to stay and play for an unlimited\namount of time is also deliberate, based on further research that shows the\nlonger a customer experiences the product, the greater their willingness to\nbuy it.\nA global company with 400 locations,\nBuild-A-Bear is centred on offering a highly\nmultisensory, engaging and interactive\nexperience. In the stores, children can\nchoose, design and participate in the creation\nof their own stuffed animals in-store.\nAlthough Build-A-Bear is not a ‘store’; they\ncall their locations ‘workshops’, and above\nevery bear hangs a sign that evokes the mere\nexposure and endowment effects, to\nencourage the children to touch the bears:\nD RESS  ME, H UG  ME, H EAR  ME, F LUFF  M E,\nC HOOSE  ME!\nMore evidence of the effects of\nownership comes from a study in 1984,\nwhere researchers gifted participants either a lottery ticket or two dollars.\nLater, each of them was offered an opportunity to swap the lottery ticket for\nthe money or the money for the lottery ticket. Only a few participants were\nwilling to make the trade.\nHow about in real-world conditions? Dan Ariely and Ziv Carmon from\nDuke University examined the endowment effect in everyday life. The most\npopular sport at Duke is basketball – there is not enough space at the court\nfor all the people who want to watch the games. Consequently, the\nuniversity created a randomised lottery system to distribute tickets to each\ngame.\nCrucially, Carmon and Ariely conducted their experiment during the\nfinal round of the college basketball tournament March Madness, when the\n\f\ndemand for tickets was higher than usual. The students surveyed by the\neconomists all waited patiently on the university grounds in order to enter\nthe lottery.\nAfter the lottery, the ticket winners were asked how much they would\nsell their tickets for if someone wanted to purchase them. Those who hadn’t\nwon a ticket were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a\nticket.\n\f\nOn average, those who didn’t have a ticket said they would pay up to\n$175. Those who had won a ticket said they would not sell theirs for less\nthan $2,400! So, those with tickets valued them nearly 14 times as much as\nthose who didn’t have them.\nTHE R EASO N FO R  O U R  PO SSESSIV ENESS\nPossessiveness can be traced back thousands of years in human history and\nis still observed today in some of our primate cousins.\nIn 2004, two economists conducted an experiment using chimpanzees,\nfruit juice ice lollies and nut butter inside a tube. The food was chosen\nspecifically because it couldn’t be eaten too quickly and would last long\nenough for the purpose of trading. When given a choice, 58 per cent of the\nchimpanzees preferred the nut butter to the ice lollies. Unsurprisingly, of the\nchimpanzees who were given the nut butter, nearly 79 per cent opted not to\ntrade it for the ice lollies. But of the chimpanzees who were given the ice\nlollies, 58 per cent refused to trade for the nut butter.\nThe economists concluded that the endowment effect probably became\nrooted within humans early on in our evolution. But why were early\nhumans so protective of what they had and reluctant to trade or pay for\nwhat they did not yet have? The answer seems that the risk associated with\ntrading – particularly if the other party didn’t act fairly – was a serious\ndeterrent. Our ancestors had no reliable way of enforcing the conditions of a\ndeal, so they reduced the price they were willing to pay for things (the value\nof the trade) to compensate for the risk of ending up with nothing or less\nthan they should have got.\nTHE LAW : LET THEM  TRY AND  THEY W ILL\nBU Y\nGetting your product into customers’ hands remains an incredibly powerful\ntool for salespeople, marketers and brands. Next time you’re trying to make"

    "raw_text": "If I could put our success down to just one thing – although the blue\nslide mentioned in Law 10 would be close – undoubtedly it would be that\nwe told the most captivating, surprising and emotional stories. I never, ever\n‘pitched’. I never bombarded an audience with graphs, stats or data. Every\ntalk I delivered started, sounded and ended more like something out of\nHarry Potter than a sales presentation.\nI, like most people, have a horrifically short attention span when I’m\nbored of something – so much so that I was expelled from school for\nsleeping in lessons, skipping classes and had a 31 per cent attendance\nrecord. I then went off to university, fell asleep in the first lecture, dropped\nout the next day and never went back. I think because of this, I’ve naturally\nalways understood how important it is to tell stories that demand attention –\nsomeone talking at me in a monotone voice for a prolonged period of time\ntriggers my brain’s snooze button.\nBut for some reason, most stories delivered on stage are still horrifically\nboring. After spending years shedding blood, sweat and tears while creating\nsomething, the creator of that thing nearly always falls into a delusional,\nself-centred bubble. They begin to believe that the thing they’ve created is\nso revolutionary, fascinating and important, that it’s inherently worthy of\nthe world’s undivided attention.\nFrom this distorted, self-absorbed perspective, one of the most common\nand treacherous traps the creator of that thing can fall into when telling their\nstory to the world is believing that their audience cares about them, their\nproduct, their hard work and their ‘innovation’ as much as they do. When\nthis happens, the story they tell becomes logical long, and lacklustre.\nConversely, when a storyteller understands that nobody – absolutely\nnobody – cares about them as much as they care about themselves (nobody\ncares that their toothpaste is a little mintier, their marketing agency is a little\nbolder or their clothing brand is a little more fitted) they tell captivating,\nemotional, punchy stories that leave you no choice but to commit your\nundivided attention to every word they say.\nMrBeast, if you’re unfamiliar, is arguably the most famous YouTuber in\nthe world: at the time of writing, he has over 150 million subscribers, he has\n\f\n30 billion video views, and he’s reportedly generating hundreds of millions\nof dollars from his videos every year. He’s recently announced that he will\nbecome the first billionaire YouTuber – and I tend to believe him.\nHow has he done it? In his own words, the first few seconds of every\nvideo is the most important – in the opening five seconds of every video\nhe’s made, he delivers what he calls ‘a hook’ – a clear, compelling promise,\nexplaining why you should watch the video, that bypasses your brain’s\nhabituation filter, makes you think WTF? and in doing so prevents the\nviewer from tuning out and clicking away.\nHe says you shouldn’t start with anything else; you shouldn’t introduce\nyourself, ‘overexplain anything’ or even have the typical B-roll footage\noverlaid with music that most video creators opt for. He essentially screams\na compelling promise in his audience’s face, which holds their attention\nlong enough for him to deliver upon that promise. Here are some examples\nof the first five seconds of his videos:\nVideo 1, first five seconds:\nI RECREATED EVERY SINGLE SET FROM SQUID GAME IN\nREAL LIFE, AND WHICHEVER ONE OF THESE 456 PEOPLE\nSURVIVES THE LONGEST, WINS 456 GRAND! (350 million views)\nVideo 2, first five seconds:\nI PUT 100 PEOPLE INSIDE OF A GIANT CIRCLE, AND\nWHOEVER LEAVES THE CIRCLE LAST WINS $500,000! (250 million\nviews)\nVideo 3, first five seconds:\nI SPENT $2.5 MILLION DOLLARS ON THIS PRIVATE JET AND\nHAD 11 PEOPLE PUT THEIR HAND ON IT. WHOEVER TAKES\nTHEIR HAND OFF THE JET LAST, WINS THE PRIVATE JET! (100\nmillion views)\n\f\nOver the last ten years, I’ve become known for repeating one hypothetical\nscenario, over and over again. Whenever I’m faced with a marketing team\nthat has regrettably fallen into that delusional self-centred bubble – when\nthey’ve fallen into the trap of overestimating how much the world cares\nabout them – I tell them this:\nImagine, the customer you’re trying to reach is called Jenny. Imagine\nright now, she’s just left home for work, after a long sleepless night and an\nargument with her husband. FUCK, she’s got a flat tyre and has just broken\ndown on the motorway in the pouring rain; she’s now late for work, she’s\nangry, she’s tired, and she’s time-poor. She pulls out her phone on the side\nof the road to call the breakdown service and the first thing she sees is your\nmarketing message, your advert, your content.

    "raw_text": "In a study led by Microsoft in 2015, Canadian researchers monitored the\nelectrical brain activity of 2,000 participants. The research showed that, in\nthe last 15 years, the average human attention span had dropped from 12\nseconds to 8.\nTo place this in perspective, it was reported in the same article that\ngoldfish have an attention span of 9 seconds: one whole second longer than\nhumans! So if someone ever compares your attention span to that of a\ngoldfish, an appropriate response is now, in fact, ‘thank you’.\nW e are increasingly distracted. O n\naverage, an oﬃce worker will pick up their\nphones more than 1,500 times per week,\namounting to 3 hours and 16 minutes a\nday, and will check their email inbox 30\ntimes every hour.\nThe average web page visit lasts for just 10 seconds or so, and Ofcom,\nthe UK’s communications regulator, reported in August 2018 that people\ncheck their smartphones almost every 10 minutes while they’re awake.\nI interviewed Johann Hari, bestselling author of Stolen Focus, a book\nabout dwindling human attention spans, and he said to me:\nI ended up travelling all over the world. I interviewed 250 of the\nleading experts in the world about attention and focus, from\nMoscow to Miami; from a favela, a slum in Rio de Janeiro, where\nattention had collapsed in a particularly disastrous way; to an office\nin New Zealand. We are facing a real crisis. Our attention span\nreally is shrinking. There are changes in the way we live that are\npouring acid on everyone’s ability to pay attention. We have an\n\f\nattentional pathogenic culture, a culture in which it is very hard for\nall of us to form and sustain deep focus. This is why activities that\nrequire deep forms of focus, like reading a book, have just fallen off\na cliff in the last 20 years.\nOver the last ten years I’ve produced thousands of videos, and the retention\ngraphs on those videos tell a predictable and often disheartening story: I\nlose 40–60 per cent of my viewers within the opening seconds in pretty\nmuch every video I make that is longer than five minutes, on every social\nplatform.\nThis serves to prove that those first five seconds disproportionally dictate\nthe fate of every second that follows. This is true for social media content,\nspeeches, videos and any other medium that’s fighting for your attention.\nFive years ago, my marketing company was tasked with promoting a\ncampaign. It was a hilarious two-and-a-half-minute video that had cost\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and it was our job to make sure\nit got seen.\n\f\nWhen the company sent us the asset to distribute, we initially suggested\nthat they re-edit the video to make the opening five seconds more\ncompelling. In the asset they had sent us, the first five seconds featured an\nestablishing shot of the location overlaid with the brand’s logo.\nWe were instructed that the video needed to be shared as it was, and so\nwe followed their instructions and shared it across a variety of highly\nengaged social media channels. The results were underwhelming to say the\nleast.\nWhen the client asked me why it had underperformed, we told them that\nthe opening five seconds were killing the entire video. We offered to re-edit\nthe first five seconds and assured them that those five seconds were\nchanging the fate of the proceeding two and a half minutes.\nThankfully they obliged. The re-edited video went viral, racking up\nmore than 3 million views across our social media channels within seven\ndays. A tiny change to the first five seconds had meant that 150 per cent\nmore people continued watching past the ten second mark and stayed\nwatching long enough to enjoy the video, engage with the video (which\nmakes the algorithms share it) and directly share it on their own feeds.\nTHE LAW : FIGHT FO R  THE FIR ST FIV E\nSECO N D S\nI could give you a hundred more client case studies that prove those first\nfive seconds are do or die for any great story. If you want your story to be\nheard, you must aggressively, passionately and provocatively design those\nfirst five seconds to be thumb-stoppingly compelling, annoyingly magnetic\nor emotionally engaging. Drop the warm introduction, the pleasantries and\nthe musical B-roll footage, and urgently get to the most compelling\npromise, point or provocation that you can. No matter the medium, you\nmust earn the right to the attention you’re seeking within those first five\nseconds.\n\f\nAttention might just be the most generous\ngift that anyone can give."

    "raw_text": "LAW 19\nYO U M UST SWEAT THE SM ALL STUFF\nThis law reveals what every great entrepreneur, athlete and coach seems to instinctively know: yoursuccess will be defined by your attitude towards the small stuff – the things most people overlook,ignore or don’t care about. The easiest way to do big things is by focusing on the small things.\nIn 2023, my podcast, The Diary Of A CEO, became the most downloaded podcast in the UK, accordingto Apple’s end-of-year ranking. It reached the number one spot in the USA Spotify business podcastcharts, and for the first time ever, in January gained more subscribers – 320,000 – on YouTube than thelegendary podcaster Joe Rogan did in the same month.Our podcast is relatively new compared to many of our peers. We only started producing thepodcast weekly and in video form just over two years ago. I actually don’t believe the podcast has beensuccessful because of me as a host; I don’t believe that my questions are significantly better, or that ourediting is the best, or even that we have the most famous guests in the world. I’m not saying we’re badat these things, but there are others doing those things better.\nThe secret, in my opinion, is that we sweat the small stuﬀmore than any other team I have ever encountered. Weobsess over thousands of small details that I believe mostpeople would dismiss as trivial, crazy or a waste of time.\nTo offer just a few examples: before a guest arrives, we research their favourite music and play it softlyin the background when they arrive – no guest has ever mentioned this, but we believe that it will putthem in a better, more open mood. We’ve researched the optimal room temperature for a conversation –not too hot, not too cold. We A/B test the title, thumbnail and promotion of each podcast episode usingAI and social media ads weeks before the podcast is published to the public. We’ve even hired a full-time in-house data scientist and had him create an AI tool that translates the podcast into multiplelanguages, so if you click on the YouTube version of the podcast while you’re in France, for example,both mine and the guest’s voices will be automatically translated into French. We’ve built a data-drivenmodel that informs us which guests we should book, the best-performing topics the guest haspreviously discussed, the optimal length for a conversation, and even how many characters long thetitle of a podcast should be.\n\f\nOur success can’t be attributed to being the best at any one thing, but it can be attributed to ourrelentless focus on the smallest stuff. Searching for minor, seemingly trivial ways to improve hasbecome our religion. This same meticulous philosophy is embodied by all my companies and is ashared characteristic among the world’s most innovative, fast-growing and disruptive brands.\nKAIZEN\nFor 77 years, through ups and downs, General Motors (GM) had led the way, with higher car salesannually than any other company globally. But in recent years they’ve been dethroned by Toyota andits unique approach to building cars, a company and a culture.Toyota was announced as the world’s leading automaker in terms of sales for another consecutiveyear in 2022. Their year-on-year growth of 9.2 per cent increased the gap with their closest competitor,Volkswagen, by almost 2 million cars sold, compared to the 250k gap the year before.Central to the company’s success is something called the ‘Toyota Production System’. It wasdeveloped during the post-Second World War era in Japan, when the country was undergoingreconstruction and facing a shortage of capital and equipment. In response to these challenges, Toyotaengineer Taiichi Ohno formulated a philosophy that allowed the company to extract the maximumpotential from each component, machine and employee.The secret to Toyota’s philosophy is a principle known by its Japanese name, ‘kaizen’, whichmeans ‘continuous improvement’. In the kaizen philosophy, innovation is seen as an incrementalprocess; it’s not about making big leaps forward, but rather making small things better, in smallways, everywhere you can, on a daily basis.\nThe kaizen philos\u0000phy vehemently rejects the notion thatonly a select few members of a company’s hierarchy areresponsible for innovation; it insists that it has to be aneveryday task and concern of all employees, at all levels.\nBecause of the kaizen philosophy, Toyota reportedly implements a staggering one million new ideaseach year – the majority of which are suggestions made by ordinary factory-floor workers.Remarkably, Toyota’s US facilities are said to receive a hundred times fewer suggestions from theirworkers than their Japanese counterparts.These suggestions are often tiny, including things like increasing the size of water bottles to betterhydrate employees, lowering a shelf to make tools slightly easier to reach or making the font on asafety warning just one point size bigger to reduce accidents.These suggestions may sound insignificant in nature, but the kaizen philosophy believes that it is infact the smallest of improvements that will cumulatively push the business forward and keep it ahead ofcompetitors that don’t care about sweating the small stuff.Kaizen philosophy says you must create a standard, make sure everyone meets the standard, askeveryone to find ways to improve the standard, and repeat this process for ever.\n\f\nKAIZEN VS. CO NVENTIO N\nBecause Toyota is one of Japan’s most successful companies, many have assumed its success is downto ‘Japanese’ culture, pay dynamics or employee attitudes. But history tells another story.In the early 1980s, during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, tensions had been mounting between theUnited States and Japan over the large number of imported cars flooding American roads. Americanindustry had been struggling. The General Motors plant in Fremont, California, was a prime example ofthis deterioration. With regards to quality and productivity, it was GM’s worst plant by far: it took muchlonger on average to assemble a vehicle compared to any other plant and defects in finished cars raninto double digits.The lack of Fremont-built cars in the employee car park clearly showed the absence of employeepride and confidence. The plant had a backlog of some 5,000 union grievances and there had been anumber of strikes and ‘sickouts’ by the United Auto Workers; labour conditions were toxic andunsustainable.Huge amounts of temporary workers were needed on any given shift to cover absenteeism rateswhich exceeded 20 per cent. While special cleaning crews were hired to clear the liquor bottles anddrug paraphernalia from the employee car park after each shift.GM viewed the plant as irreversibly broken, and in February, they closed the factory and laid off theentire workforce.Toyota spotted an opportunity to resolve the wider trade frictions and test its kaizen philosophy onits competitor’s home turf. In 1983, Toyota approached GM with the idea of a joint partnership. TheFremont factory would reopen and be renamed New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI),making the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Prizm as its primary products.\n\f\nToyota offered to invest cash, oversee the smooth running of the plant and implement theirphilosophy. They even agreed to rehire the same workers, use the same workers’ union, the samefacilities and the same equipment, despite the terrible failure of the plant just a year earlier.Toyota’s former chairman, Eiji Toyoda, believed that this was the necessary first step towardshaving a wholly owned Toyota manufacturing factory in North America. But he also saw it as theperfect way to test the viability and transportability of the Toyota Production System.Toyota hired back almost 90 per cent of the Fremont hourly union workforce and implemented a‘no lay-off policy’, preventing anyone from being fired. They sent 450 group and team leaders toToyota City to be trained in their unique kaizen-inspired ‘Toyota Production System’, at a cost of over$3 million. Under the Toyota philosophy, workers would have a strong voice in plant operations. Theworkers’ old, 100-line job descriptions were replaced by two words: ‘team member’. Managementhierarchy was simplified, reduced from fourteen levels to just three: plant management, group leader,team leader.As if by magic, employees who had previously been so disillusioned that they turned against theiremployers began participating in work-related decisions. They received training in problem solving andkaizen practices, so that they became true experts in their respective areas. The parameters of their jobsradically changed as well: rather than being expected to simply do their bit, they were tasked withproactive thinking and improving.Team members were empowered to quickly implement ideas for improvement, and anything thatworked was replicated as best practice. All team members could also stop the entire line at any time tofix a problem by pulling a cord that was accessible from any location in the factory.Within a year of launching in 1985, the NUMMI factory had the highest quality and productivity ofany GM plant in the world.Rather than an average of twelve defects per vehicle it was now just one, even though cars wereassembled in half the time it had previously taken the disgruntled workers. Just 3 per cent of workerswas absent at any time, a reflection of the fact that worker satisfaction and engagement had soared.Operational innovation also took off: employee participation in new ideas exceeded 90 per cent andmanagement recorded the implementation of nearly 10,000 new ideas.By 1988, NUMMI was winning awards, and by 1990, the Toyota Production System and its kaizenphilosophy became the global industry standard for manufacturing. All in under two years. Thebuilding, workforce and equipment was unchanged. The philosophy was new and the outcome wasradically different.\n1 PER CENT CAN CHANGE YO UR FUTURE\nThe great illusion in life and business that makes the kaizen philosophy of incremental improvementsso poorly adopted, disregarded and overlooked, is that small things are just small things.This is objectively true, but a large number of small things is a large thing, and it’s easier, moreinclusive of all team members, and therefore more achievable to aim at improving a large number ofsmall things than it is to galvanise people to find and implement big things.It’s an unfortunate reality of life that things that are easy to do are also very easy not to do. It’s easyto save $1, so it’s also easy not to save it. It’s easy to brush your teeth, so it’s also easy not to brushyour teeth. When things are easy to do, and not to do, the outcome of doing or not doing them is\n\f\ninvisible in the short-term, so we often choose not to do them. But maths and economics clearlyillustrate how our smallest decisions have the biggest impact on our future position.Over time, the difference between allowing something to worsen by 1 per cent each day vs.improve by 1 per cent each day becomes extremely significant. Consider this:\nYear Year Start Year End: 1% bettereach day Year End: 1% worseeach day\n1 £100 £3,778 £2.5517964452291100000\n2 £3,778 £142,759 £0.0651166509788394000\n3 £142,759 £5,393,917 £0.0016616443849302700\n4 £5,393,917 £203,800,724£0.0000424017823469998\n5 £203,800,724 £7,700,291,275£0.0000010820071746445\n6 £7,700,291,275£290,943,449,735£0.0000000276106206197\n7 £290,943,449,735£10,992,842,727,652£0.0000000007045668355\n8 £10,992,842,727,652£415,347,351,332,000£0.0000000000179791115\n9 £415,347,351,332,000£15,693,249,374,391,300£0.0000000000004587903\n10 £15,693,249,374,391,300£592,944,857,206,937,000£0.0000000000000117074\nIf you start the year with £100 and manage to improve that value by 1 per cent each day for 365 days,you will have multiplied that value by 37. Over ten years, assuming the same 1 per cent per dayincremental improvement, that value balloons to £15 quadrillion!Conversely, letting that £100 degrade by 1 per cent each day quickly reduces your money to £2.55after one year, 6p after 2 years and 0p thereafter."

    "raw_text": "of ‘suggestions’ are usually not ‘creative ideas’ by Toyota’s standards but anonymous complaints,unconstructive criticisms or passive-aggressive attacks on how the company operates. Two: the fewproactive suggestions are either never actioned or cannot possibly be actioned because they areimpractical. It is the deadly mix of complaining by the workforce and lack of follow-through bymanagement that leads sadly to the destruction of trust and the dusty death of the suggestion box.So what’s different about Japanese companies’ teian, or suggestion systems? Why do they workwhere other systems fail? Are their employees smarter or more sensible? Are the managers more opento finding useful suggestions among the unhelpful ones? Is it to do with Japanese culture? The answeris much simpler, and unconnected to any national culture.The answer lies with the person we will call the ‘idea coach’ and any company can take advantageof this. When Toyota’s manager of domestic public relations in Japan, Ron Haigh, was asked how theycan accept 99 per cent of the ideas that arrive in their suggestion system, he had a telling answer.Ron explained that supervisors reviewed their employees’ ideas with them one on one, coachingthem on the practicalities, giving them direction and support to make the idea well-rounded andeffective, and helped it to succeed. This sits in stark contrast to most Western suggestion-box systemswhere the manager says ‘yes’ or – perhaps more often – ‘no’, then explains why an idea will ‘neverwork’.Under the kaizen system, your supervisor is your idea coach. It remains the employee’s idea, butthrough working with someone who is more experienced with a deeper understanding of the art of thepossible, 99 per cent of ideas are accepted and collaboratively developed into something that couldwork.All employees at Toyota are tasked with coming up with at least one idea per month – making it acentral part of everyone’s role. Supervisors are also tasked with making sure each of their teammembers succeeds in coming up with at least one idea per month. This ensures that everyone is rowingin the same direction – it’s in everyone’s best interests to help ideas succeed.Coaches also have coaches – each supervisor has a coach above them, who is incentivised to helpthe supervisor develop enough new ideas each month. In this way, everyone from the top to the bottomof the company is positively encouraged to listen, to refine and to support all new suggestions.Critically, the person who implements the idea has to be the one who had it in the first place. Youcan imagine how this principle alone alters the types of suggestions people make. A criticism is nolonger an idea; ‘I hate the office music’ can’t be a suggestion, as under this principle every idea must bepractical, productive and focused on a solution.Finally, Toyota employees are all provided with an education in kaizen, the Toyota ProductionSystem, and how the idea-suggestion process works. It’s exceptionally rare for Western counterparts toeducate their teams on the philosophy of incremental gains, how to properly formulate suggestions andthe rationale behind their philosophy.\nAVO ID PAYING FO R SUGGESTIO NS\nCompanies tend to treat employees like rats in a maze sprinting after cheese by paying them for thebehaviour they want to reinforce. This is the easy, less-effective, short-term, costly approach. Theharder, more effective, cheaper approach is to create a culture where people care enough, are motivatedenough and are recognised sufficiently enough to step forward, contribute and invest their energy in thebetterment of the company.\n\f\nUnder the kaizen philosophy, you need lots of ideas, very often, to make meaningful progress overtime. And in order to get lots of ideas, you need people to be driven by their own curiosity, motivationand care. There’s a famous fable that illustrates this idea well:\nThere was once an old woman, who lived alone. Every afternoon, her peace and quiet wasdisrupted by children playing noisily on the street outside her house. As time went on, thechildren got noisier and noisier, and the woman became more and more infuriated. One day shehad an idea: she called them over and explained to them amiably that hearing them playingjoyfully outside was the highlight of her day, but that there was a problem: in her old age andisolation, she was going deaf. So, she asked, would they be willing to make even more of aracket, just for her? She went one step further, offering them each a quarter for their trouble.The next day, the kids eagerly returned and made a huge din outside her house, as requested;they were each paid their 25 cents and asked to return the next day. But this time, the womanonly paid them 20 cents. And the following day it was just 15 cents! The poor old womanexplained that she was running out of money, and that their fee would drop to a nickel a dayfrom now on. The kids were appalled at the prospect of earning a fifth of what they wereearning just days before. They stormed off and pledged never to return. It was simply not worththe effort, they said, for just five cents a day.\nThe woman’s clever idea was to take the joy out of the thing the children loved doing and were doingfor free. The bigger lesson is clear, though: it’s possible to replace a genuine motivation with asynthetic one. This phenomenon is also known as ‘motivation crowding’: if you attach a financialreward to ideas, it can interfere with or even eliminate people’s genuine creative energy and ambition.This is more than a fable; this is science. I interviewed motivation expert and author Daniel Pinkabout the impact financial rewards have on our motivation and he shared a plethora of research thatshows that paying someone to do something that they once did for fun will cause them to lose theintrinsic joy of doing that task. When a hobby becomes a job, motivation drops.Scholars at the London School of Economics and Political Science looked at 51 studies on pay-for-performance schemes and stated: ‘We find that financial incentives may indeed reduce intrinsicmotivation and diminish ethical or other reasons for complying with workplace social norms such asfairness. As a consequence, the provision of financial incentives can result in a negative impact onoverall performance.’\nINNO VATIO N DISTO RTIO N\nInnovation is often portrayed as a miraculous occurrence, something that only arises from the genius ofa select few or the luck of a fortunate accident. The light bulb, Velcro, penicillin and Post-it notes arejust a few examples that perpetuate this misleading belief.The painful, incremental process behind the breakthrough is nearly always neglected in the retellingof these stories of invention, which only highlight the final outcome.\nDon’t let these myths deceive you - true innovation isnearly always born from the sweat and determination of\n\f\npersistent individuals and great teams bound together bythe right culture and philos\u0000phy, not from eurekamoments, accidental fortune or intentional genius.\nIn all the companies I’ve founded that have reached the summit of their industry, there was no onedecision, invention or innovation that got us there. My central focus has always been to get our teamsto ‘out-care the competition’. Creating a culture through recognition, celebration and evidence, whichcontinually proved to all of us that the smallest of things – the easiest and most accessible things – canhave the biggest of impacts.‘One per cent’ is the most repeated phrase in my companies, and one of my key responsibilities asCEO is identifying and encouraging those 1 per cent gains, wherever they might arise within thecompany.\nTHE LAW: YO U M UST SWEAT THE SM ALL STUFF\nI’ve always felt that I have a cheat code. While our competitors think consistency or big wins are thepaths to the podium, I know – without a shadow of a doubt – the correct route is to be found by makingconsistently small improvements, sweating the smallest stuff and fighting for tiny gains.\n\f\nIf you don’t care about tiny details you’ll produce bad workbecause good work is the culmination of hundreds of tinydetails. The world’s most successful people all sweat thesmall stuﬀ.\n\f\nLAW  20\nA SM ALL M ISS NO W  CR EATES A BIG M ISS\nLATER\nThis law reveals why most people end up lost in their relationships and\nwork because they’ve overlooked one simple, ongoing discipline in their\nlives.\nAsked to explain how Tiger Woods became one of the greatest golfers of all\ntime, most of us would reel off the same well-known facts: he was a child\nprodigy, his talent already apparent when he was just two years old; he\ndevoted his life to training, famously spending hours analysing footage of\nhis performance; his own father described him as ‘The Chosen One’ and\nhad unshakeable belief in his potential.\nBut those who really know Woods will tell you it’s his kaizen\nphilosophy of obsessive, continuous tiny improvements that deserves the\ncredit for his accomplishments.\nIn 1997, after the Masters tournament and just seven months after\nturning professional, Woods told his coach, Butch Harmon, that he wanted\nto rework – effectively rebuild – his entire swing from scratch. Harmon\nwarned Woods that there were no shortcuts, that it would be a long journey,\nand that his performance at tournaments would get much worse before he\nsaw any improvement.\nFriends, fellow players and experts agreed, but Woods knew his swing\ncould be marginally better, so he ignored them. He viewed reinventing his\n\f\nswing not as a threat to his game, but an opportunity to incrementally\nimprove it, and so he took the chance and started his kaizen journey.\nWoods was directly inspired by Toyota’s quest for perfection, and began\nto speak of the kaizen philosophy as if it were his religion. He and his coach\nwent on to create their own kaizenesque sequence of: hitting practice balls\nrepeatedly; reviewing footage of his swing to discover improvements;\nimplementing any improvements in the gym and on the course. And repeat.\nJust as his coach predicted, it was a long road. Woods stopped winning\n– in fact he didn’t win anything for 18 months – and pundits began to say it\nwas all over for him. But Woods and his coaches had faith that small\nimprovements would show up after longer periods of time. He told his\ncritics, ‘Winning is not always the barometer of getting better.’\nWoods’s kaizen attitude paid off. His new swing would develop into a\nlethal weapon: more precise, more accurate and more versatile than ever\nbefore. He enjoyed a record six straight wins starting in late 1999 and since\nthen, Tiger Woods has arguably become the best golfer of all time, with 82\nPGA tour wins – more than anyone has ever achieved before.\n\f\nW oods proves that the pursuit of\nperfection is a matter of discipline, not\nbeing heroic.\nCharles Darwin’s theory of evolution and ‘survival of the fittest’ posits that\nnot making small adaptations can result in extinction, while small mutations\ncreate a survival advantage. This idea serves as a fitting analogy for the\nkaizen philosophy.\nAs Charles Darwin argued, an individual’s success won’t be determined\nby a single stroke of genius. Instead, it will be the by-product of a\nphilosophy that fosters gradual evolution, mutation and adaptation in any\nand every aspect of an organism, over an extended period of time.\nIn aviation there’s a principle called the ‘1 in 60 rule’, which means that\nbeing off target by 1 degree will lead to a plane missing its end destination\nby 1 mile for every 60 miles flown. This concept also applies to our lives,\ncareers, relationships and personal growth. Just a small deviation from the\noptimal route is amplified over time and distance – something that feels like\na small miss now can create a big miss later.\nThis highlights the need for the real-time course corrections and\nadjustments that the kaizen philosophy provides. If we are to be successful,\nwe all need simple rituals to assess our course and make the necessary small\nadjustments, as frequently as possible, in all aspects of our lives.\nJohn Gottman, the acclaimed relationship psychologist, concluded from\ndecades of research that the existence of ‘contempt’ in a relationship is the\nbiggest predictor of divorce. Contempt is the subtle disrespect and disregard\nof your partner – like an aircraft being one degree off course, the harm\nhappens slowly, over time, in relationships where the couple fail at conflict\nresolution because of poor or infrequent communication.\nThis insight led me to establish one of the most important kaizen-style\nrituals I have in my romantic relationship: a scheduled weekly check-in"

    "raw_text": "LAW 21\nYOU MUST OUT-FAIL THE COMPETITION\nThis law proves that the higher your failure rate, the higher your chances of\nsuccess. It will inspire you to start failing much faster than you currently\nare!\nThomas J. Watson was president of IBM for an incredible 38 years, was one\nof the most notable entrepreneurs in the USA in the first half of the\ntwentieth century – alongside Henry Ford – and he became one of the\nrichest men of his time because of his enormous success at IBM. His core\nprinciple of innovation could be summed up in a simple sentence: ‘If you\nwant to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.’ He also said,\n‘Every time we’ve moved ahead in IBM, it was because someone was\nwilling to take a chance, put their head on the block, and try something\nnew.’\nWhen he was asked if he was going to fire a male employee who made\na mistake that had cost the company $600,000, he swiftly replied, ‘No, I\njust spent $600,000 training him. Why would I want somebody to hire his\nexperience?’\nHe instinctively understood that failure was both an opportunity for\nprogress, and that the opposite – a lack of failure – would be the death of\nIBM. He warned against complacency, even when IBM reached the top of\ntheir industry, and in line with the kaizen approach, he said, ‘Whenever an\nindividual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress\nstops.’\n\f\nEven before I had heard about Thomas J. Watson and his\nunconventional perspective on failure, I spent ten years encouraging,\nmeasuring and driving up my team’s failure rate. We all know failure is\nfeedback, and we can agree that feedback is knowledge, and as the cliché\nasserts, knowledge is power. Therefore, failure is power, and if you want to\nincrease your chances of success, you must increase your failure rate.\nThose who fail to constantly fail are destined to be the eternal followers.\nThose that out-fail their competition will be followed for ever.\nHOW TO INCREASE YOUR FAILURE RATE\nBooking.com is the largest and most successful hotel booking site in the\nworld. But, like every industry leader, it started small, broken and behind.\nGillian Tans, Booking.com’s former CEO, said: ‘Many companies start\nwith a nice product and market it all over the world. Booking did the\nopposite. We had a basic product and then worked hard to figure out what\ncustomers wanted. We failed so many times.’\nA few years after launching, a Booking.com engineer attended a\nconference in 2004, where he heard Microsoft’s Ronny Kohavi on the\nimportance of experimentation and failure. He took the learnings back to\nhis team at Booking.com, where there were constant, time-wasting\ndisagreements about the next step forward, the right features to implement\nand the direction to take.\nThey began to learn what customers wanted through simple\nexperiments, and then used those insights to build a product – the\nBooking.com we know today. As Tans says, ‘We grew like this, without any\nmarketing or PR, just constant testing and experimentation of what our\ncustomers liked.’\nHaving seen the success that increasing experimentation and failure had\nhad on the firm, Booking.com developed and launched its own\n‘experimentation platform’ in 2005 that allowed it to tremendously scale up\nthe amount of tests it was running.\n\f\nAdrienne Enggist, senior director of product development at\nBooking.com, recalled:\nI came from small businesses where CEOs launched a big product\nredesign every six months, and by the time you rolled it out, it was\nhard to figure out what worked and what did not work. Here, the\nteam was small, fitted on one floor, and it was exciting to see\neveryone take risks, fail, push small changes very quickly, and use\nexperiments to measure the impact.\nBooking.com would go as far as appointing a ‘director of experimentation’,\nwho has publicly evangelised about how critical it is for companies to fail\nmore, fail more often and measure those experiments, saying: ‘We believe\nthat controlled experimentation is the most successful approach to building\nproducts that customers want.’\nToday Booking.com has 20,300 employees and $10 billion in annual\nrevenue. The website is available in 43 languages and features over 28\nmillion listings in every corner of the world. And in the moment that you’re\nreading this, 1,000 experiments are being run by Booking.com – led and\ndevised by every single product and technology team they have. They credit\ntheir culture of out-failing their competition as being a key reason why\nthey’ve overtaken their competition.\nAmazon follows the same fail-faster religion. Jeff Bezos, founder of the\ntrillion-dollar e-commerce platform, sent the following memo to his\nshareholders when the company became the fastest ever to reach annual\nsales of $100 billion:\nOne area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure. I\nbelieve we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of\npractice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To\ninvent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that\nit’s going to work, it’s not an experiment. Most large organisations\n\f\nembrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string\nof failed experiments necessary to get there.\nOutsized returns often come from betting against conventional\nwisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10 per\ncent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every\ntime. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all\nknow that if you swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a\nlot, but you’re also going to hit some home runs. The difference\nbetween baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a\ntruncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how\nwell you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In\nbusiness, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you\ncan score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why\nit’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many\nexperiments.\nIn a related interview, Jeff Bezos expanded upon this idea:\nTo be innovative, you have to experiment. You need to do more\nexperiments per week, per month, per year, per decade. It’s that\nsimple. You cannot invent without experimenting. We want failures\nwhere we’re trying to do something new, untested, never proven.\nThat’s a real experiment. And they come in all scale sizes.\nAmazon has one of the biggest business graveyards of failure – something\nI’m sure Bezos is proud of – A9.com (the Amazon search engine), the Fire\nPhone and their Endless.com shoe website are just some of the notable\nprojects that were so unsuccessful you’ve probably never heard about them.\nHowever, when one of their experiments pays off, it completely changes\nthe trajectory of their business, and covers the losses of all of their failures\ncombined: Amazon Prime, Amazon Echo, the Kindle and, most notably,\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)."

    "raw_text": "AWS was launched as an experiment unrelated to Amazon’s e-\ncommerce business, but in 20 years has become the fastest-growing B2B\ncompany of all time. It is the world’s top cloud computing platform. It has\noperations in 24 geographical regions and boasts over 1 million active users\nin 190 countries, $62 billion in revenue and $18.5 billion in annual profit.\nIn 2022, that little experiment from 20 years ago was the single biggest\ncontributor to Amazon’s total profit. In 2011, Amazon created its very own\nexperimentation platform, Weblab, which now runs more than 20,000\nexperiments each year to continuously innovate and improve on customer\nexperiences.\nJeff Bezos explained how Amazon decides which experiments a\ncompany should pursue in his 2015 shareholder letter:\nSome decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly\nirreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made\nmethodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and\nconsultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the\nother side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call\nthese Type 1 decisions.\nBut most decisions aren’t like that; they are changeable,\nreversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal\nType 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for\nthat long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2\ndecisions can and should be made quickly by high-judgement\nindividuals or small groups.\nAs organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use\nthe heavyweight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions,\nincluding many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness,\nunthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and\nconsequently diminished invention.\nA BATTLE BETWEEN FATHER AND SON\n\f\nFor six years I advised an industry-leading, multi-billion-dollar e-commerce\ncompany in the food industry that had two brands underneath it. One brand\nwas run by the father, who had founded the whole group, and the other,\nmuch newer brand had been launched by the son. When my company was\nappointed to help them scale their marketing, customer acquisition, social\nmedia and innovation efforts, I initially spent up to four days a week in the\nboardroom with both the father and the son, understanding their brands,\ntheir goals and their objectives.\nI visited both brands every week without fail; I travelled the world with\nthem; I was in the room, doing everything from advising their crisis-\nmanagement press releases to producing their social media strategy and\nadvising them on which marketing activities to pursue. When they went to\nParis to launch a new product, I was on the plane; if they had an event in\nAmerica, I was there; if they had an important meeting in Singapore, I\ntravelled with them; and when they launched in the Middle East, I was on\nthe ground.\nIn the six years that I advised them and acted as a member of their\nextended family, I watched the son’s part of the company go from an\nunknown, small, unprofitable brand to the best-loved, most culturally\nrelevant, highest grossing brand in its industry. At the same time, I saw the\nfather’s brand falter, stagnate and slow down. Ultimately the son’s brand\nwould overtake his father’s – generating more than a billion dollars in\nrevenue.\nI had front-row seats to both businesses, their decisions and their\nphilosophy, and I can say with total confidence that the most significant\nreason why the son overtook his father is that the son had a failure rate that\nexceeded that of his father by a factor of ten.\nWhen my teams made a technological discovery relating to marketing,\ngrowth or social media, we brought it to both brands at the same time, on\nthe same day, but we were greeted with very different responses. I recall\none such innovation where we found a way to grow their social media\nfollowing 20 times faster than usually possible using a technique we’d"

    "raw_text": "discovered with a particular platform. I personally took this discovery to\nboth the son and the father in 2016, in two separate meetings.\nThe father’s team listened to the idea, requested a bigger presentation,\nscoffed at our fee and they informed me that they would need various layers\nof sign-off to proceed. Nine months later, they were still ‘discussing it\ninternally’.\nThe son didn’t put me in front of a team at first; he wanted to hear the\nidea himself. Before I could even finish my explanation, he called out to his\nassistant, ‘Bring all of the marketing team into the room asap.’ When the\nmarketing team arrived, he told me to repeat what I had just said, and upon\nfinishing my explanation, he looked at his team and remarked, ‘We’re going\nto do this today.’ He looked back at me and said, ‘Steven, whatever you\nneed, it’s sorted – full steam ahead, right now!’\nNo contracts, no lawyers, no layers of sign-\noﬀ, no delays - trust, speed and\nempowerment.\nThat one idea resulted in the son’s brand adding 10 million more followers\nto one of its social media channels over the following months. In the end, it\ncost them 95 per cent less to grow their social media page using our\ndiscovery, than all the strategies that the brand had adopted in the past.\nThe son instinctively knew that this was a ‘Type 2’ decision – the sort of\ndecision that wouldn’t have irreversible harm if it failed, could be reversed,\nbut also could ultimately change the course of the brand if it succeeded.\nAnd he knew that in the face of a Type 2 decision, Jeff Bezos’s words\nshould be followed: ‘Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by\nhigh-judgement individuals or small groups.’\nThe son knew that the biggest cost wasn’t failing, it was missing an\nopportunity to grow and wasting time to learn a new lesson regardless of\nthe outcome. If the experiment had failed, it would have cost them one day\n\f\nand a little money, and we’d be on to the next experiment within 24 hours,\none failure closer to the right answer.\nBy the time the father’s brand had decided to cautiously proceed with\nthe idea, some ten months later, it no longer worked – the platform loophole\nwe were using had been closed, and growing a social media channel had\nonce again become expensive, complicated and difficult.\nIt’s important to note that most of the ideas we brought to the son didn’t\nhave such astonishing results. Most experiments fail, no matter how well-\ndesigned. I would estimate that three in ten were tragic failures, three in ten\nwere average failures, three in ten were good, and one in ten was great – so\ngreat that it changed the fortunes of their business and paid for any losses\nincurred by the other nine.\nGet to 51 per cent certainty, and make\nthe decision.\nMany years later I would have the honour of sharing the same stage as\nBarack Obama in Brazil, and Obama would remark that when facing tough\ndecisions – like whether or not to fly into Pakistan unannounced at night in\nthe hope of assassinating Osama bin Laden – he turned to probability\ninstead of certainty.\nHe said every decision was painstakingly difficult: ‘If it was an easily\nsolvable problem, or even a modestly difficult but solvable problem, it\nwould not reach me, because, by definition, somebody else would have\nsolved it.’\nInstead of saying, ‘Will X or Y happen if I make this decision?’ he\nwould say, ‘What is the chance of X or Y occurring?’ He insisted that\nhaving smarter people in the room was key: ‘Having the confidence to have\npeople around you who were smarter than you or disagreed with you is\ncritical.’ And he would weigh each decision not just on the probability of\nbeing right, but the impact it would have if he was wrong: ‘You don’t have\n\f\nto get to 100 per cent certainty on your big decisions, get to 51 per cent, and\nwhen you get there, make the decision quickly and be at peace with the fact\nthat you made the decision based on the information you had.’\nAs I came to learn from working with the father and son’s companies,\nfrom my more than ten years advising the world’s leading brands, and from\nBarack Obama, the truth is that perfect decisions exist only in hindsight;\ndwelling too long on potential outcomes, and procrastinating in the process,\nis futile. The real cost of indecision in business is wasted time. That time\ncould have been used failing your way to knowledge that would ultimately\nhelp you to succeed. Instead, some brands freeze in fear, and in their\nattempt to avert any losses, they end up losing the most expensive and\nimportant things: opportunity, knowledge and time.\nNassim Taleb, author and researcher, sums it up in this graph:\nCREATING A PRO-FAILURE PHILOSOPHY\nSome of the companies I worked with got this right: they had lightning-fast\nexperimentation cycles, they viewed change as an opportunity, they out-\nfailed their competition and they nearly always outpaced their industry.\n\f\nSome of the companies I worked with believed in this philosophy, tried it\nand failed; they asked their teams to innovate more, wrote it on the office\nwall, but it simply never happened. And some companies didn’t believe in it\nat all; those companies were almost never founder-led, they were either\nstagnant or in decline, and they viewed the changing world as nothing more\nthan a threat.\nI discovered five consistent principles that the most innovative\ncompanies naturally embodied, which I believe enable teams to out-fail\ntheir competition:\n1. REMOVE BUREAUCRACY\n‘It is a villain,’ says Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. ‘Its tentacles should be\ntreated like the cancers they so much resemble,’ says Berkshire Hathaway\nvice chair Charlie Munger. ‘It’s a disease,’ says Jamie Dimon, the CEO of\nJPMorgan Chase.\nAll of these esteemed business leaders are talking about ‘bureaucracy’ –\na word that seems to have no successful fans. In simple terms, the worst\ncorporate bureaucracies are companies with lots of rules, long and painful\nsign-off processes, and several layers of hierarchy between the bottom and\nthe top.\nThese systems disempower employees, slow companies down,\ndisincentivise experimentation, delay innovation and stifle the goldmine of\nideas that exist in the minds of the workforce.\nSystems like this are a tax on human\ningenuity, energy and entrepreneurism.\nAs Laurence Peter, author of The Peter Principle, put it: ‘Bureaucracy\ndefends the status quo long past the time the quo has lost its status.’\nBureaucracy is often seen by company leaders as an unfortunate\nnecessity for businesses operating in complex regulatory and international"

    "raw_text": "environments. The US workforce is an example of this: since 1983, the\nnumber of managers, supervisors and administrators has increased by over\n100 per cent, in comparison to an increase of roughly 40 per cent for all\nother occupations.\nIn recent years, nearly two-thirds of workers said their organisations had\nbecome more bureaucratic, according to a Harvard Business Review survey.\nMeanwhile, productivity growth has stalled. In the bigger companies that\nhave come to dominate Western economies, bureaucracy is particularly\ndetrimental. In the US labour force, over one-third of workers are employed\nin firms of 5,000 or more employees – and frontline workers are generally\noverseen by eight management levels.\nConsidering the astounding speed of change happening in the world – as\nrevealed in Law 5 – doing anything to slow down your company’s rate of\nexperimentation at this point in history is a death wish.\nHaier Group, a Chinese appliance business that generates more than $35\nbillion in annual sales, understands this better than anyone. To avoid the\ntoxic consequences of bureaucracy, they’ve divided their 75,000 employees\ninto 4,000 micro-organisations, most of which have just 10 to 15\nemployees. Decisions are made at lightning speed by small, autonomous\nteams and subsequently they’ve managed to out-fail their competition,\ninnovate at the speed of the market, and dominate their industry.\nAnd Steve Jobs, co-founder and CEO of Apple, when speaking about\nbureaucracy at the company, said:\nWe are organised like a start-up. We’re the biggest start-up on the\nplanet and we all meet for three hours once a week and we talk\nabout everything we’re doing. Teamwork is dependent on trusting\nthe other folks to come through with their part without watching\nthem all the time, but trusting that they’re going to come through\nwith their parts. And that’s what we do really well.\nThe key, as I’ve witnessed in all of my own companies, clients and case\nstudies, is to make project teams as small as they can possibly be, to give\n\f\nthem more authority, trust and access to resources when making decisions,\nand to cut back all sign-off processes, especially when a team is seeking to\nmake a Type 2 – low-consequence, reversible – decision.\n2. FIX THE INCENTIVES\nIn 2020, my company was tasked with resuscitating a faltering fashion e-\ncommerce company that was on the brink of financial collapse. The Covid-\n19 pandemic had prompted the closure of their physical stores, resulting in\na reduction of staff and wages. Employee morale was on its knees and a\nnew CEO had recently been appointed to steer the company in a new\ndirection.\nDuring my first presentation to the CEO, I outlined the need for the\ncompany to increase their rate of failure by an order of magnitude in all\nareas, including marketing. They were lagging behind their competitors,\nmissing opportunities and squandering resources on ineffective traditional\ntactics.\nUpon hearing my proposal, the CEO mentioned that the company\nalready encouraged their team to experiment more, citing the inclusion of\n‘fail faster’ as one of their four core values in the employee handbook, and\ntwo of the words prominently displayed on the office kitchen wall.\nFollowing my presentation, I held private sessions with staff – from\nmanagers to interns – for several hours. During a meeting with the brand’s\nmarketing team, I posed the question, ‘What reason do you have to fail\nmore often?’ A prolonged, revealing silence ensued before I rephrased the\nquestion, asking, ‘What reason have you got not to fail more often?’ The\nmarketing manager’s previously paralysed mouth sprang to life as she\ndrowned me with a series of responses, including ‘I don’t want to be\nembarrassed’, ‘I won’t receive a pay increase’, ‘people will think less of\nme’, ‘I might be fired’, ‘I’m too busy to try new things’.\nAs she rattled off more and more reasons, it became increasingly\napparent that the organisation was plagued by a disease called ‘misaligned\nincentives’ – what the company expected of its employees was not in line\nwith what it incentivised them to do. The company wanted innovators, risk\n\f\ntakers, entrepreneurs – but, upon close inspection – as is the case in most\nslow, dying companies – people were simply incentivised to  . . . do their\njob, no less, no more.\nIt is startling to me, still, that any CEO would believe that the cute\nwords, clichéd slogans and aspirational values they put in employee\nhandbooks matter at all.\nWords need evidence, incentives and\nexamples to bring them to life. Human\nbehaviour is not driven by platitudes,\nslogans and wishful thinking.\nIf you want to predict what a group of people will do over the long term,\nyou need to look at their incentives, not their instructions.\nTo redesign the incentives of the marketing department, one of the many\nsystems I implemented was a recognition process designed to celebrate an\nemployee or team when an experiment was successfully executed,\nregardless of the outcome. After all, executing the experiment is the\ncontrollable factor; whether it’s successful or not in the market is\nimpossible to control, so it’s not where our incentives should focus.\n3. PROMOTE AND FIRE\nI told the CEO of the fashion company to identify the employees that were\nfailing the fastest and to promote them as high in the organisation as she\ncould. Companies don’t have one company culture; every manager in an\norganisation creates a sub-culture underneath them.\nAt my first marketing company we had almost 30 managers, and I\nobserved time and time again how one team’s satisfaction, attitude and\nphilosophy could be starkly different to the team they were sat next to,\n\f\npurely because of their manager. With 30 managers, we really had 30\ncompany cultures.\nInuence trickles down: you need the\npeople at the highest point in the\ncompany to be the most avid disciples of\nyour cultural values.\nWhen you promote those employees – or give them pay rises – let all team\nmembers know why they’re being promoted, and point out their\nexceptionally high failure rate.\nConversely, it’s important to swiftly remove individuals from the team\nthat stand in the way of the flow of new ideas, fast failure and\nexperimentation. Especially if those employees are managers – one bad\nmanager can destroy the morale, motivation and optimism of a great team\nof perfectly capable, hopeful and entrepreneurial employees.\n4. MEASURE ACCURATELY\nWhile advising the fashion e-commerce business, I asked the CEO to\nestablish, educate and continually communicate to all team members an\n‘experimentation process’ that everyone should follow, use to measure, and\nuse to communicate a new idea or experiment that they wanted to pursue.\nToo often employees don’t step forward\nwith new ideas because they’re unclear on\nthe process they should follow. Education\n\f\nis the easiest way to remove operational\npsychol\u0000gical friction.\nAnd lastly, I told the CEO to measure – team by team – the organisation’s\nfailure rate, with a clear goal of increasing every team’s failure rate by a\nfactor of ten by year end.\nIn business, you don’t improve what you don’t measure, and what you\nfocus on grows. By establishing visible KPIs (key performance indicators)\nand clear goals, and making them everyone’s responsibility, nobody at the\nfashion business could be ‘too busy’ for experimentation – as is the case\nunder the kaizen philosophy – it became a central part of everyone’s job.\nThe organisation slowly changed direction, breaking even for the first\ntime in seven years in the first year, and turning a sizeable profit in the\nsecond.\nIts newfound creativity, innovation and empowered workforce made it\nfeel like a brand-new company. Staff retention rates improved, employee\nsatisfaction scores soared and the company innovated more than ever\nbefore.\n5. SHARE THE FAILURE\nIf you want to maximise the return from every failure, it is crucial to\ndisseminate the details of each failed hypothesis, experiment and outcome\nthroughout your organisation. This information represents a form of\nintellectual capital that can serve as a foundation for future experiments. By\nopenly sharing failures, you can prevent the duplication of unsuccessful\nefforts, stimulate the development of new ideas, and foster a culture of\ncontinuous experimentation. As Thomas Edison said, ‘I have not failed.\nI’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.’\n\f\nTHE LAW: YOU MUST OUT-FAIL THE\nCOMPETITION\nFailure is not a bad thing, and to increase your chances of success you need\nto increase your failure rate. Every time something is tried and found not to\nwork, valuable information is gained that can be shared with your team.\nBusinesses that experiment faster, fail faster, and then continue to\nexperiment, nearly always outpace the competition.\n\f\nFailure = Feedback.\nFeedback = Knowledge.\nKnowledge = Power.\nFailure gives you power.\n\f\nLAW  22\nYO U  M U ST BECO M E A PLAN -A THIN KER\nThis law will demonstrate why your Plan B in life might just be the biggest\nhurdle to the success of your Plan A.\nThe story I’m about to tell you changed my life.\nOn Friday, 13 October 1972, Nando Parrado woke up after being\nunconscious for 48 hours. He wasn’t coming round after an operation or\nemerging from some two-day bender: he was surrounded by dead bodies\nand injured friends, thousands of feet above sea level in a glacial valley in\nthe Andes, amidst the wreckage of an airplane crash, with no means of\ncalling for help or even working out exactly where they were.\nOf the 45 passengers, members of a Uruguayan rugby team on their way\nto Chile for a match, 29 survived the crash. Initially they did what they\ncould, drinking melted snow and eating whatever they could salvage from\ntheir luggage. ‘On the first day,’ recalled Parrado, ‘I slowly sucked the\nchocolate off the peanut  . . . On the second day  . . . I sucked gently on the\npeanut for hours, allowing myself only a tiny nibble now and then. I did the\nsame on the third day, and when I finally nibbled the peanut down to\nnothing, there was no food left at all.’ \nA full week later, facing the threat of starvation and knowing, after\nfinding a transistor radio, that the Chilean authorities had called off their\nsearch efforts, Nando and his fellow survivors did the unimaginable: they\ndecided they had no choice but to eat the dead bodies."

    "raw_text": "Among the few women on the plane had been Parrado’s mother and\nlittle sister, whom he had invited on the trip to watch him play. His mother,\nXenia, 49, died instantly on impact; his little sister, Susy, initially survived\nthe crash but died in her brother’s arms a week later.\nThe first body they ate was the pilot’s, since they held him responsible\nfor the crash. Other bodies, the survivors agreed, were off limits, including\nthose of Xenia and Susy. But Parrado became tormented by the idea that\nsomeone would violate their agreement, and he couldn’t live with himself if\nthat happened.\nTwo months after the crash, Parrado announced that he was setting off\nto find help. He was starved, had no mountaineering experience, and no\nidea where he was going, but somehow this was a better option than eating\nthe bodies of his mother and sister: ‘I didn’t want to have to eat their bodies,\nI didn’t want to face that moment,’ he said.\nNando and his friend Robert sewed together material for a sleeping bag\nand knocked together a sled, then set off. They decided to ascend rather\nthan descend, since a higher vantage point would give them a better chance\nof working out an escape route. It took them three gruelling days and they\nsomehow made it to the top of a 15,000-foot peak three days later, but\ndidn’t find what they were hoping for.\nWhat I saw when we reached the peak of the first mountain really\nfroze me. I couldn’t breathe, speak or think, what I saw was\nhorrible; instead of green valleys, we saw mountains and snow-\ncovered peaks, 360 degrees around us, stretching as far as we could\nsee into the horizon. And that’s when I knew I was dead  . . . But\nthere is no way that I can go back, and eat the bodies of my mother\nand sister, the only way is forward, we will die, but we will die\ntrying  . . . I will keep on going until I stop breathing.\nThey staggered down the other side of the mountain and began to force\nthemselves along the glacier below, growing ever weaker day by day. The\n\f\npair limped on for ten days through the ice-cold mountains, deep snow and\ndeadly crevasses.\n‘It was a blurry, continuous, painful effort, the mountains were so huge\nthat it feels like you’re not making any progress, you would set yourself a\ntarget location in the distance, and you would think it would take two or\nthree hours to get there, but it was so huge that you never seemed to get\nthere,’ he said.\nSickness set in, the men’s bodies began to shut down, and then on 18\nDecember, they came upon a river. As they followed it, they saw signs that\nsomeone had been there recently: a soup can, a horseshoe, even a herd of\ncows, until finally on 20 December, they spotted a man on horseback on the\nother side of a huge river.\nThe men couldn’t make themselves heard above the roar of the river, so\nParrado mimed an aeroplane crashing to try to explain who they were,\nthough he worried the man would think he was mad and ride off. Instead,\nthe man tied a note to a rock and threw it across the river: ‘Tell me what\nyou want.’\nParrado wrote back, ‘I come from a plane that fell into the mountains.\nWe have been walking for ten days. We have no food, and I can no longer\nwalk.’ He explained that he had 14 friends remaining in the mountains\nalive, and that they desperately needed help.\nThe man received the note and was shocked, but believing what he read,\nhe travelled for ten hours on horseback to the nearest civilisation and\nreturned the next day with a rescue team. Miraculously, 72 days after the\nplane crash, Parrado and his friend were saved, and the next day he took the\nrescue team back to the crash site in a helicopter, where the 14 other\nsurvivors would be found and rescued.\n‘The only way you go forward, is because you can’t go back,’ he\nexplained.\nParrado’s story is a story of human perseverance, fortitude and courage,\nin the face of hopeless desperation. I stumbled across his story at 19 years\nold, while I was in a dire financial situation, trying to pursue my first\nbusiness idea, disowned by my parents for dropping out of university,\n\f\nshoplifting and scavenging food on my worst days, while living in a\ndeprived area of the country, alone and broke.\nHis story changed my life. It gave me hope in my darkest time, wind in\nmy sails when I needed it the most and more reason to push on despite the\ncircumstance I was in. After several years of perseverance, I too had\nescaped my situation: I had built a successful company, I was financially\nfree, and my life resembled that of my wildest dreams.\n‘The only way you go forward, is because you cannot go back.’ I\ncouldn’t go back. I had nowhere ‘back’ to go. Not having a Plan B became\nthe most incredible motivational force in my life. When the human mind\nexcludes all other possibilities and fixates on a single path, that path draws\nin every available ounce of your passion, perseverance and power, leaving\nno room for hesitation or deviation.\n‘The rst step before anybody else in the\nworld believes it is you have to believe it -\nthere is no reason to have a Plan B,\nbecause it distracts from Plan A.’\nWill Smith\nHad I had an alternate path available to me, it’s entirely possible that those\ndarkest of hours might have lured me down it. This might sound like cute\nbut meaningless motivational words or an unrealistic platitude, but\namazingly, researchers have recently revealed that having a Plan B – in any\nambition – has a net negative impact on our chances of succeeding with our\nPlan A.\nM AYBE W E SHO U LD  PU T ALL O U R  EGGS IN\nO N E BASKET"

    "raw_text": "You’ve probably heard the advice ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’.\nWhen it comes to choosing a career or applying to university, or even\napplying for a new job, having a back-up plan is widely thought to be a\ngood idea. Studies have shown that this approach does help to alleviate\nsome of the psychological discomfort associated with uncertainty, but\nastoundingly new research has also shown that it comes at a big cost.\nHaving a back-up plan, or even\nconsidering one, has been shown to\npotentially hinder your performance by\nmaking you less driven to hit your primary\ngoal.\nAcross three studies, almost 500 students were asked to solve a difficult\nword puzzle that involved unscrambling muddled sentences. If they were\nsuccessful, they would be given a delicious snack. Before attempting the\npuzzle, some groups of students were told to think through a back-up plan –\nother ways they could get a free snack on campus – if they couldn’t\nunscramble the sentences.\nResearchers found that the groups that had no Plan B performed\nradically better than the back-up plan groups; they had higher levels of\nmotivation, valued success more, and solved more of the puzzle.\nSubsequent experiments have replicated the results in other contexts with\ndifferent rewards (e.g., money, other prizes and saved time), and the results\nwere always the same.\nOne of the researchers, behavioural scientist Katy Milkman, concluded:\n‘This suggests that thinking through a back-up plan will actually make you\nwant to achieve your goal less, which then hurts your effort, performance,\n\f\nand ultimately, your chances of successfully achieving your goal. These\nfindings apply to goals where success is highly dependent on effort.’\nAdditionally, while some can feel frozen by their fear of failure,\nresearch shows that the fear of failure can actually provide the impetus\nneeded to get to your goal. In a similar vein, other research has shown that\nthe more you perceive negative emotions in the event of failure, the more\ndriven you will be to succeed. However, if you have a back-up plan, the\nincentive to succeed is lessened because you have removed the fear of\nfailure.\nBEIN G R ISKY D O ESN ’T M EAN  BEIN G\nR ECKLESS\nIf you’re reading this and it’s made you consider making a deadly ten-day\ntrek across the Andes mountains, I need to provide a disclaimer. There is a\ndifference between taking a risk – focusing your entire being on a goal –\nand being outright reckless.\nIn my story, of course, I was not at risk of death; I’m fortunate enough\nto live in a society that would have caught me, fed me and housed me, if I\nhad needed catching. And many of you will have dependents, mortgages\nand other responsibilities that you understandably need to protect.\nPracticality must be a priority.\nTHE LAW : YO U  M U ST BECO M E A PLAN -A\nTHIN KER\nThis law remains one of those uncomfortable, unavoidable realities of the\nhuman condition. The amount of ourselves that we can dedicate to an\noutcome – mind, energy and focus – is positively correlated with the\nlikelihood of that outcome. Some call this manifestation, but I call it Plan-A\nthinking. In the pursuit of your most important goals, a back-up plan is an\n\f\nadditional weight to carry, a motivational burden to bring and distracting\ncompanion to call.\n\f\nThere’s no greater force of creativity,\ndetermination & commitment than a\nperson undistracted by a plan B."

In your\ncareer being an ostrich will get you killed. This law will teach you how to\navoid being an ostrich.\n‘God himself could not sink this ship,’ said Edward Smith, captain of the\nTitanic, as people warned him of the dangers of ice in the area.\nHours later, when the ship struck an iceberg, and began to flood and\nsink, First Officer Murdoch, who had been on watch at the time of the\ncollision, is reported to have turned to chief steward John Hardy and said, ‘I\nbelieve she [the Titanic] is gone, Hardy.’\nDespite their looming fate, passengers later recalled a bizarre sense of\ncalm, disbelief and normality on the decks. ‘There were some people who\nwere playing cards, and there was one man who was playing the violin.\nThey were just as calm as if they were in a drawing room,’ said passenger\nEdith Russell.\nAnother passenger, Ellen Bird, described how some people seemed to\ncompletely ignore their impending fate: ‘I saw one or two men and women\nget up, look out of the window, and then sit down again, evidently with the\nidea that they would go back to bed.’\nWilliam Carter, who survived by climbing into a collapsible boat, one of\nthe last lifeboats to get away, said he had tried to convince George Widener\n\f\nto come with him in the lifeboat. Carter said that Widener ignored his\nwarning and said, ‘I think I’d rather take my chances.’\nConsequently, the already limited number of lifeboats were leaving\npartially empty. As the situation grew more dire, crew members began to\nfrantically blow whistles, panic and shout orders to try to get the passengers\nto the lifeboats. According to survivor accounts, some of the crew members\nhad to physically force people to board lifeboats, against their will.\nVery late in the sinking, just minutes before the boat was completely\nsubmerged, when most of the decks were completely flooded, widespread\npanic did begin. Second Officer Lightoller had to brandish his gun and Fifth\nOfficer Lowe actually fired shots along the side of the ship to keep people\nfrom swamping the last lifeboats as they were being loaded and lowered.\nOne frantic crew member even entered the radio room and attempted to\nsteal the senior wireless officer Jack Phillips’s lifebelt as he was working\nthe radio.\nConsequently, of the 2,240 people on board, almost 70 per cent of them\ndied.\nSuch denial is a complicated thing to understand. As you read this story,\nhindsight might portray these avoidant, unresponsive passengers as foolish,\nirrational and reckless. However, their response perfectly illustrates a very\nhuman, very common behavioural phenomena called ‘the ostrich effect’.\nTHE O STR ICH EFFECT\nWhen an ostrich senses danger, it buries its head in the sand. The idea is\nthat if the ostrich can just hide from the threat, the danger will eventually\npass. We humans are no different. When dealing with difficult information,\nsituations or conversations, we tend to be like the ostrich and bury our\nheads in the sand too.\nAs humans, we are hard-wired to avoid discomfort. We stop ourselves\nfrom checking our bank accounts when we know we’ve overspent, we\navoid difficult conversations that we don’t want to have, and more"

    "raw_text": "problematically, we delay booking that doctor’s appointment, to avoid\nreceiving bad news about our health.\nA report recently released by UK bank TSB revealed that indebted\nBritish people are cumulatively losing £55 million a month by not\nconfronting their finances and making simple changes. One substantiating\nstudy found that investors were likely to check the value of their personal\ninvestment portfolios when the markets overall were rising, but would\navoid looking when the markets were flat or falling.\nIn a more startling study of 7,000 women\naged 50–64, researchers found that women\nwho had heard a colleague had been\ndiagnosed with breast cancer were almost 10\nper cent less likely to go and get a free\ncheck-up themselves.\nIn the moment when the ostrich effect\nkicks in, we don’t just have anxiety, the\nanxiety has us, and that anxiety presses us to\navert our gaze from the thing that is making us most anxious. As\npsychiatrist George Vaillant notes, ‘Denial can be healthy, enabling\nindividuals to cope with rather than become immobilized by anxiety, or it\ncan be unhelpful, creating a self-deception that alters reality in ways that are\ndangerous.’\nIn entrepreneurship, the ostrich effect is too often the difference\nbetween a company’s success or failure. Research conducted by Leadership\nIQ, the corporate survey firm, collected data from more than 1,000 board\nmembers across almost 300 organisations that had fired their CEO. They\nfound that 23 per cent of those boards had fired their CEO for ‘denying\nreality’, 31 per cent for ‘mismanaging change’, 27 per cent for ‘tolerating\nlow-performing staff’ and 22 per cent for ‘inaction’. These are all common\ncorporate symptoms of the ostrich effect.\n\f\nIn business, the person with the fewest\nblind spots stands the greatest chance of\nvictory.\nWe think better, make better decisions, and achieve better outcomes when\nwe’re closest to reality. The stories of Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster, Yahoo,\nBlackBerry and MySpace illustrate clearly that those who feel most\ninvisible are often most susceptible to becoming an ostrich in the face of\ninnovation, change and inconvenient truths.\nHO W  TO  AV O ID  BECO M IN G AN  O STR ICH\nI interviewed world-renowned author Nir Eyal in my office in New York in\npreparation for this book; he’s spent several years studying what motivates\nhuman behaviour at the best and worst of times. He told me:\nPeople think they’re motivated by seeking pleasure; they’re wrong,\nthey’re motivated by avoiding discomfort. Even sex – and the\nhorniness it creates – is a form of discomfort that we seek to relieve\nourselves from.\nMost people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth\nthat distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.\nHow we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines\nwhether we pursue healthy acts of traction or self-defeating\ndistractions.\nIn my own career, none of my greatest professional mistakes and regrets\nwere unsuccessful business decisions that I made; they were the\ninstinctively obvious but terribly uncomfortable decisions I didn’t make: the\nthings I avoided confronting through fear, uncertainty and anxiety. The\nperson I knew I needed to fire but didn’t, the conversation I needed to have\n\f\nwith a client but avoided, and the warning I needed to articulate to the board\nthat I delayed.\nSimilarly, we can all relate to the toxic consequences that the ostrich\neffect can have on our romantic relationships: avoiding the difficult\nconversation, evading the awkward issues and pretending things are fine.\nThese symptoms of co-denial and mutual avoidance hold a failing\nrelationship in place, when neither party has the words, courage or\nconviction to confront their unmet needs. Arguments happen, but they’re\nrarely the right arguments. In a relationship, if you’re having the same\nconversation over and over again, you are having the wrong conversation.\nYou’re avoiding the uncomfortable conversation you should be having.\nPain in every walk of life is unavoidable,\nbut the pain that we create by trying to\navoid pain is avoidable.\nIn business, the pain of the ostrich effect and the unresolved conflict it\ncreates is felt by your employees, in parenting it’s felt by your children and\nin your own life it will be felt in your mind, your body and your soul.\nA White House staff member during the Kennedy administration once\ncommented that it was always obvious when there was conflict between the\npresident and the First Lady versus when they were relating amicably.\nWhen met with surprise from the interviewer that their relationship would\nbe so transparent, the staff member replied:\nThey actually were quite private about their struggles, but we knew\nwhen they were fighting simply by watching the interactions of their\npersonal staffs. When the hairdressers and the transport people were\narguing we knew this was because JFK and Jackie were in some\nform of conflict. When these groups had their act together, we knew\nthe first couple was getting on OK.\n\f\nAt the core of this story from the Kennedy administration is the notion that\nconflict moves around within and between levels of a social system. When\nsomething is unresolved because we’ve chosen to bury our heads in the\nsand, it doesn’t sit dormant, waiting to be addressed; it becomes toxic,\ncontagious and poisonous to those around us, and inflicts more collateral\ndamage with every day that it remains unaddressed.\nFive years ago, I realised that I needed to find a way to overcome my\nown ostrich-like behaviour so that I could confront the most uncomfortable\nof realities in life, business and love, with speed and honesty. It’s my belief\nthat you cannot reach your highest potential without a better relationship\nwith discomfort, bad news and inconvenient truths. Using advice from\nbehavioural economics, psychology and sociology, I created my own four-\nstep approach to dealing with discomfort and avoiding procrastination.\nSTEP 1: PAU SE AN D  ACKN O W LED GE\nThe first step is to pause and to admit to yourself that something is not\nright. Such moments of pause tend to come about when people notice the\npower and horrible longevity of their own unwanted emotions. If you don’t\npause, the process cannot begin and you cannot create enough space for the\nnext step.\nSTEP 2: R EV IEW  YO U R SELF\nThe next step is to inspect yourself in terms of feelings, behaviours and\nemotions. These examinations are critical. They enable people to begin to\narticulate what they have only sensed: that something is awry in them,\nsomething is misaligned, a need is being unmet or a fear has taken control.\nPeople who pause and inspect themselves are like detectives that are\naware that a crime has been committed – they can see the evidence in its\nwake, but they haven’t yet identified the culprit. Solving such crimes\nusually involves the help of others. People need help to get outside of their\nown narratives and accurately diagnose themselves, rather than simply\nbeing driven by their preferred ways to frame and blame.\n\f\nSTEP 3: SPEAK YO U R  TR U TH\nThe next step is to speak your truth. Share the findings of your inspection,\nwithout blame and with an emphasis on personal responsibility. This marks\nthe moment that unaddressed interpersonal conflicts move from the wrong\nconversations to the right conversations.\nIn the ostrich effect, people turn away from and do not speak directly of\nthe emotions that grip them. They avert their gaze, misdiagnose the issues\nand distract themselves with something else. The issue that lies beneath\nremains unspoken. That silence drives the ostrich effect. Loosening its grip\nbegins with the moments that people speak what has not yet been spoken.\nIronically, the science shows that it is in talking about our disconnections\nthat people create more connectedness with one another.\nSTEP 4: SEEK THE TR U TH\nIn the last step, you must humbly seek the truth – a feat that is easier said\nthan done in the presence of our cognitive biases, righteousness and\nignorance. This means to listen. But not just listening to hear, listening to\nunderstand. Not from the perspective of an adversary that’s looking for\nvictory, but from the perspective of a partner, patiently intent on\novercoming a difficulty."

The pressure might have been too much for anyone\nelse, but not her. She had won a record 20 titles at Wimbledon, the entire\ntennis world watched her play, every sportswriter was ready to criticise her\nevery move. When asked how she coped with the unthinkable burden of the\nworld’s expectations, Billie Jean King casually replied, ‘Pressure is a\nprivilege – it only comes to those that earn it.’\nThis statement – ‘pressure is a privilege’ – naturally evokes a mixed\nreaction, as most overly simplified mantras do. When people hear it, they\nhear ‘stress is a privilege’, so it’s important to clarify that stress and\npressure are two entirely different things. Stress is an internal psychological\nresponse and pressure is an external environmental force. Of course,\npressure can cause both good and bad stress, depending on the individual,\nbut the pressure itself is not at fault. The pressure is a subjective situation,\nnot an objective emotion, and in the presence of a strong pressure, one\nperson’s stress is another person’s pleasure.\nI don’t enjoy all my pressure – especially not in the moment – and none\nof my pressure is easy; it’s often tested me in ways I wouldn’t have\n\f\nvolunteered to be tested, but all my greatest pressure has preceded all my\ngreatest privileges. The two concepts have a clear, unbreakable relationship\nthat I find liberating, motivating and reassuring to understand. Pressure\nshines a light on who I am and who I’m not at the same time,\nsimultaneously illuminating how far I’ve come and how far I’m yet to go.\nFor me, a life without pressure is a life without purpose. The pressure isn’t\nthe problem – as I said, pressure is neither good nor bad – but our\nrelationship, perspective and evaluation of pressure and the stress it creates\ncan have purposeful or deadly consequences.\nJU ST A CO LD, D AR K N IGHT O N  THE SID E O F\nEV ER EST\nPressure isn’t life or death, but your perspective of it might be.\nAt the University of Wisconsin, researchers conducted a study of stress\non 30,000 American adults. They asked the participants questions like\n‘How much stress have you experienced in the last year?’ and ‘Do you\nthink that stress is harmful for your health?’ Eight years later, they used\npublic death records to find out who was still alive. Unsurprisingly, people\nwho experienced a lot of stress during the time covered by the study had a\n43 per cent increased risk of dying. BUT – and this a big but – that was\nonly true for the people who had said that they believed that stress was\ndetrimental to their health. People who experienced a lot of stress but did\nnot see it as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, analysis showed\nthat they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, even including\npeople who had reported experiencing relatively little stress. The\nresearchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths,\n182,000 Americans died prematurely – not from stress, but from the belief\nthat stress is bad for you. Kelly McGonigal is a health psychologist and\nlecturer at Stanford University. In a TED Talk on this study, she pointed out,\nif the researchers’ estimate was correct, believing stress is bad for you"

    "raw_text": "would be the fifteenth most common cause of death in the United States,\nkilling more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.\n \n  \nCan you recall the last time you felt real pressure? Your heart may well\nhave been pounding, you might have been breathing faster, you might have\nhad clammy hands. Usually we interpret these physical symptoms as\nanxiety or signs that we aren’t coping well with the pressure.\nBut what if you saw them differently – as signs that your body is\nenergising you in preparation to face a challenge? That is exactly what\nresearchers conducting a study at Harvard University told participants\nbefore putting them through a high-pressure test. Participants who learned\nto view the stress response as helpful for their performance were less\nanxious, felt more confident and performed better. Particularly interesting\nwas the changes to their physiological stress response. Typically, your heart\nrate goes up and your blood vessels constrict in times of stress, – which is\nan unhealthy state to remain in.\nBut in the study, when participants saw their physiological symptoms as\nbeneficial, it didn’t stop their heart rate going up but their blood vessels\nstayed relaxed and open, meaning their cardiovascular response was\nconsiderably healthier. McGonigal remarked that participants who viewed\nstress as beneficial had a similar cardiovascular profile to people who were\nexperiencing moments of joy and courage.\nAdditionally, Harvard Business School professor Alison Wood Brooks\nhas shown how people who mentally reframe anxiety as excitement can\nimprove their performance in tasks such as sales, negotiating and public\nspeaking.\nThis one psychological mindset shift, and the physical transformation it\ncreates, could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age\n60 and living until you’re 90.\n\f\nThe objective isn’t to try and get rid of\nyour pressure, it’s to change your\nrelationship with it altogether.\nOne important way to improve your relationship with your pressure is to\nremind yourself of the positive privilege, meaning and context it exists in.\nThe difference between aspirational pressures – building a business,\ncompeting in a tournament or raising a child – and the pressure faced by a\nlow-paid production-line worker on a factory floor, under threat of being\nfired if they don’t improve their output, is how we relate to the pressure.\nPressure we view as voluntary, meaningful and high in autonomy is\nreceived as a privilege. Conversely, compulsory, meaningless, low-\nautonomy pressure feels more like psychological pain.\n‘Just another cold, dark night on the side of Everest’ is a phrase I’ve\nnaturally repeated for the last five years in my hardest moments to bring me\nback to the context of my stress.\nWhen mountaineers commit to taking on Mount Everest, they’d be\nnaive to expect a smooth journey. The same, of course, is true of starting a\ncompany, pursuing a university degree or raising a child: all of these things\ninduce pressure, stress and pain, but because that pressure is subjectively\nworthwhile, it feels different and – dare I say – enjoyable.\nYou are most susceptible to feel like a victim of the pressure in your life\nwhen you forget the context of that pressure. The most meaningful\nchallenges in your life will come with a few dark nights on the side of\nEverest.\nM AKE YO U R  PR ESSU R E YO U R  PR IV ILEGE\nThankfully, it is possible to change your relationship with pressure. After\ncombining years of qualitative and empirical research in psychology, a\nstudy published in the Harvard Business Review drawing on their work\n\f\nwith executives, students, Navy SEALs and professional athletes found that\npeople who adopt a ‘stress is enhancing’ mindset enjoy a better\nperformance at work and fewer negative health symptoms than those who\nsee stress as a negative, debilitating thing.\nI believe changing how you respond to stress and pressure can help you\nharness the creative power of stress while minimising its detrimental\neffects. I’ve done this by adopting the three-step Harvard Business Review\napproach, and share it with you here – plus a final step of my own.\nSTEP 1: SEE IT\nAwareness is the first step in hijacking any type of cognitive cycle. Don’t\ndeny it, avoid it or let is paralyse you: speak it, name it. This literally\nchanges how your brain responds, because it activates the more conscious,\ndeliberate areas of the brain rather than the primal, automatic, reactive\ncentres. As HBR explains:\nIn one study, participants in a brain scan were shown negative\nemotional images. When asked to label the emotion the images\ninvoked, neural activity moved from the amygdala region (the seat\nof emotion) to the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain in which\nwe do our conscious and deliberate thinking. In other words,\npurposefully acknowledging stress lets you pause your visceral\nreaction, allowing you to choose a more enhancing response.\nIn addition to this, it seems that trying to deny or ignore feelings of stress is\ncounterproductive. Harvard Business Review research by Peter Salovey and\nShawn Achor demonstrated that those of us who think of pressure as\ndebilitating and strive to avoid it either overcorrect or underreact to stress,\nwhereas those with a mindset that allows them to embrace the positives\nhave a more moderate cortisol response to stress. What this means in\npractice is that they are ‘more willing to seek out and be open to feedback\nduring stress, which can help them learn and grow for the longer term.’"

    "raw_text": "STEP 2: SHAR E IT\nA study conducted at the University at Buffalo found that every major\nstressful life experience increased an adult’s risk of death by 30 per cent –\nunless they then spent a significant amount of time connecting with loved\nones and their immediate community. Then, there was no increase to the\nrisk of death.\nSharing our stress with a supportive community completely changes the\npsychological impact that stress has on us. When we choose to connect with\nothers under stress, an incredible resiliency is created.\nSTEP 3: FR AM E IT\nThe key to ‘owning’ your pressure is to recognise the positive role it plays\nand the powerful signal it represents. We feel pressure when something\nmatters, when there is something at stake, when we care. Framing your\npressure in this context unleashes positive motivation and calms your\nphysiological reaction.\nIt reminds you that this is just another cold night on the side of Everest\n– a mountain that you both choose to climb and a mountain that is worth the\nclimb.\nIn Navy SEAL training, former SEAL commander Curt Cronin says:\nThe leadership squad designs situations that are exponentially more\nstressful, chaotic, and dynamic than any combat operation so that\nthe teams learn to centre [themselves] in the most arduous\ncircumstances. When the stress of the training seems unbearable, we\ncan own it, knowing that ultimately it is what we have chosen to do\n– to be a member of a team that can succeed in any mission.\nAnd that’s a worthwhile pressure to endure.\nSTEP 4: U SE IT\nWhen under pressure, stress can help you to succeed. The evolutionary goal\nof stress is to push you to perform at your best both mentally and\n\f\nphysically; to raise your game and meet the scenario or the problem you\nface. Our physical response to stress is to produce hormones, such as\nadrenaline and dopamine, which provide the brain and body with much-\nneeded blood and oxygen. This results in a state of higher energy, enhanced\nalertness and a boost in focus.\nWhat a wonderful way for our body to prepare us. Don’t fight it, use it.\nFormer Navy SEAL commander Cronin recently said, ‘Learning to ask,\n“how could these experiences serve us?” and being pushed to use them to\nfuel us, proved a powerful tool in helping our individuals, teams and\norganization thrive, not in spite of the stress but because of it.’\nAs Teddy Roosevelt famously said, if we are to fail, at least we fail\nwhile ‘daring greatly’, which is a more admirable fate than that of ‘those\ncold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat’.\nPR ESSU R E CAN  SAV E YO U R  LIFE\nIn preparation for this book, I interviewed more than ten health experts\nabout the topic of stress, pressure and its impact on our health. One of the\nmost surprising reoccurring concerns I had presented to me can be\nsummarised in something said to me by Gary Brecka, founder of 10X\nHealth:\n‘W e are living in a comfort crisis. W e are\nslowly suﬀocating ourselves to death with\ncomfort by avoiding the hard things that\nare good for our health. Aging is our\naggressive pursuit of comfort.’\n\f\nHe believes that humans physiologically thrive and are innately designed to\nlive under the right types of pressure. He says we’re supposed to experience\nextreme cold and hot temperatures – we’re not meant to live in perfectly\nregulated room-temperature environments. And we’re supposed to exert\nphysical strain on our bodies; we’re not meant to be this sedentary.\nOther health experts I spoke to told me that the cost of avoiding these\ntypes of physiological pressure are seen in the obesity crisis, the rise in\nheart disease and many types of preventable illnesses.\nProfessional, psychological and physiological pressure is so often a\nprivilege that we choose to ignore because it’s  . . . ‘hard’, and as stated\npreviously we are discomfort-avoiding humans.\nHowever, in all aspects of life, ‘hard’ is the price we pay today for an\n‘easy’ tomorrow.\nTHE LAW : YO U  M U ST M AKE PR ESSU R E\nYO U R  PR IV ILEGE\nPressure doesn’t have to be a negative thing, and – if framed correctly – it\ncan be energising. Recognising, owning and using pressure can be a\npowerful tool when it comes to achieving our aims in business and life.\n\f\nComfortable and Easy are short-term\nfriends but long-term enemies. If you’re\nlooking for growth, choose the challenge."

    "raw_text": "LAW  25\nTHE PO W ER  O F NEGATIV E M ANIFESTATIO N\nThis law teaches us the wonderful power of something I call negative\nmanifestation and how it can help you see red flags, future risk and\nanything else that stands in the way of your success.\nThere exists a single question that, in my experience, has spared me more\nfinancial loss, squandered time and wasted resources than any other. This\nquestion, which I’ve grasped the significance of through a litany of failures,\nsetbacks and blunders, often goes unasked due to the unease it stirs within\nus.\nAvoiding this question places you in a perilous position, akin to the\nproverbial ostrich burying its head in the sand, as depicted in Law 23.\nWhether you ask this question or not, you will eventually find out the\nanswer – either now, through an uncomfortable conversation, or in the\nfuture, in a much more painful way.\nI was 18 years old in 2013, when I learned the value of this question\nthrough a painful lesson.\nI had set out to build an online student platform called ‘Wallpark’, and\nafter pouring three years of my time, investors’ capital, and metaphorical\nblood, sweat and tears into the project, it ultimately culminated in failure.\nAs the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. Looking back, the reason for my\nfailure seems obvious – I was unknowingly competing with Facebook in a\ncontest I stood no chance of winning.\n\f\nBut the thing is, this revelation needn’t have required hindsight; I didn’t\nneed to experience failure to recognise it. If only I’d had the humility,\nexperience and strength to sincerely ask myself one straightforward\nquestion, I believe I could have circumvented the loss of time, money and\neffort altogether.\nThat pivotal question is: ‘W hy will this\nidea fail?’\nThis question might appear straightforward and evident, yet when I\nsurveyed more than 1,000 start-up founders, startlingly only 6 per cent\nclaimed they were clear on why their idea could fail, while a tremendous 87\nper cent were clear on why it would succeed.\nThe reality is that most start-ups eventually fail, and when they do, as\nmine did, the founders seem to suddenly see the obvious – with the majority\nof them attributing their downfall to overestimating their prospects and\nunderestimating the risks.\nFor instance, according to the Small Business Administration in the\nUnited States, 52 per cent of failed founders acknowledged underestimating\nthe resources needed for success, 42 per cent admitted to not realising the\nmarket didn’t desire their product, and 19 per cent confessed to\nunderestimating their competition.\nI am convinced that the most crucial, revealing question these\nunsuccessful start-up founders ought to have asked themselves and their\ncolleagues before pursuing their ventures was, ‘Why will this idea fail?’\nBoth doctors and ailing patients can attest to the notion that prevention is\nbetter than cure, and in business there’s no chance of prevention without\nhaving a humble confrontation with the prospect of failure before starting\nout.\nThere are five main reasons why we shy away from engaging in this\ndialogue or even contemplating the possibility of failure. These five\n\f\npsychological biases, consistently identified across numerous studies, will\nlikely prevent you and your team from asking this seemingly simple yet\nessential question:\n1. O PTIM ISM  BIAS: Tali Sharot told me that about 80 per cent\nof us have this bias. Simply put, it makes us focus on good things\nand ignore bad things. It stopped me from asking ‘Why will\nWallpark fail?’, because I innately believed and wanted things to\nend well. It’s believed that this bias gave us an evolutionary\nadvantage – optimism helped us take more survival risks, explore\nnew environments and find new resources, but in our professional\nlives it prevents us from adequately considering risk.\n2. CO NFIR M ATIO N BIAS: We all have this bias to some\ndegree. It causes us to pay attention to information that supports our\nexisting ideas and hypotheses – it caused me to pay attention to, and\naccept, information that proved Wallpark was a good idea and\nignore all of the data, emails and feedback that suggested otherwise.\nResearch shows that this human bias boosts our self-esteem and\ngives us emotional comfort by making our worldview feel\nconsistent, coherent and correct.\n3. SELF-SER V ING BIAS: This bias impacts most of us to\nvarying degrees and it leads us to believe that our success or failure\nis a result of our own skill and effort. It certainty stopped me from\nthinking about why Wallpark would fail, because it made me\noverestimate my own abilities while underestimating the impact of\nexternal factors - such as market conditions, competition or other\nunforeseen circumstances.\n4. SU NK-CO ST FALLACY BIAS: This bias makes us stick\nwith a decision - even when evidence suggests that it was a bad\n\f\ndecision – because we’ve already spent time or money on it. It’s the\nreason why Wallpark carried on for three years instead of one –\nsubconsciously I didn’t want to ‘waste’ or ‘lose’ the time and money\nthat had been invested by quitting - but in doing so, I ended up\nwasting even more time and money.\n5. GR O U PTHINK BIAS: This bias prevents a group of people\nfrom asking ‘Why will this idea fail?’ because they don’t want to\ndisagree with the group. At Wallpark, at no point did any of the\nfounding team question if the idea would fail; we had all likely\nconformed around the same blind hypothesis because of our desire\nfor social cohesion, which created a strong conformity pressure for\nany new team members.\nTHE QU ESTIO N SAV ED  M Y BU SINESS\nIn 2021, I had a bold idea. Riding the wave of success from my podcast,\nThe Diary Of A CEO, I envisioned launching an entire podcasting network.\nThis ambitious plan involved creating a multitude of fresh podcasts, each\nfeaturing renowned and talented hosts. My goal was to harness our team’s\ncommercial, production and marketing expertise to propel these podcasts to\nthe same heights as The Diary Of A CEO.\nWe had a wealth of experience in scaling a number-one podcast, I had a\nphone book brimming with well-known personalities eager to collaborate\nwith me on their own podcasts, I had a team of 30 people that worked on\nThe Diary Of A CEO and I had the financial resources to invest in this new\nventure.\nTo bring my vision to life, I gathered a dedicated group of five people\nfrom the Diary Of A CEO team, and over the course of a year, we\nmeticulously planned the network, meeting with potential hosts and\nscouting for partners. I invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into the\nplanning and preparation process, along with countless hours of my own\n\f\ntime and energy, as well as that of my team members. Six months into the\nproject, I extended a formal offer to the head of one of the world’s largest\nmedia companies to run the network as CEO. To my delight, he\nprovisionally accepted and told me he would resign when I gave him the\ngreen light to join us.\nFinally, after 12 months of planning, the day of reckoning arrived. I was\nfaced with the critical decision of whether to ask the incoming CEO of this\nnew podcast network to leave his well-paying job and join our ranks. I\nknew this choice marked the point of no return. If I took this decision, there\nwould be no looking back – it would be full steam ahead with launching a\nlarge-scale podcasting network.\nIn that defining moment, the wisdom I had accumulated over a decade\nin business kicked in. I gathered my team and posed a simple yet profound\nquestion: ‘Why is this a bad idea?’ As I observed their uncomfortable\nexpressions, it was evident that their minds were grappling with an entirely\nnew challenge: one they had never contemplated before.\nWithin moments, the floodgates opened. One team member pointed out\nthat our limited talent pool would be spread too thin, jeopardising our\nexisting successful podcast business. Another chimed in, highlighting the\npotential unreliability of famous hosts and the risk of losing everything if a\nhost decided to leave. Another pointed to serious concerns about the\neconomy, and how this would cause dwindling sponsorship opportunities.\nAnother explained that it would be more difficult than we thought to\nreplicate our initial success because some of it was due to luck,\ncircumstance and fortune.\nOnce the cascade of logical reasons had subsided, a team member\nturned the question back on me: ‘Why do you think this is a bad idea?’ In\nthis moment, I realised that my subconscious had been harbouring a\nconcern rooted in past experience, which I had been avoiding due to\npsychological bias. My response was simple and honest: ‘focus.’\nI explained that our collective focus was our most valuable resource.\nFailure tempts people to lose focus as motivation and belief decreases, but\nsuccess tempts people to lose focus even more as opportunities, offers and\n\f\ncapabilities increase. Maintaining focus on our existing project, which was\nstill in a critical growth phase, was going to be both the most difficult and\nthe most important thing for us to do. Our limited supply of focus, attention\nand thinking power could not be stretched across multiple projects without\nserious consequences. Those shower thoughts, that 1am epiphany, that\npassing conversation in the hallway – we needed all those precious\nmoments to be focused on our existing podcast business, on finding\nmarginal ways to improve and on reaching our potential.\nI emphasised that by concentrating our efforts, we could achieve\ncompounding returns far greater than those from any podcast network.\nJust minutes later, we unanimously voted to shut down the project.\nRemarkably, just an hour earlier, everyone in the room had been\nsupportive of the idea and eager to launch the new venture. But one simple,\nuncomfortable question had shifted our collective mindset, invited\nimportant critical thinking and led us to see the project’s flaws in high\ndefinition.\nA year later, with the benefit of hindsight, I can confidently say that\npursuing the network would have been a costly mistake. Our team would\nhave been stretched to its limits, our existing business would have suffered,\nand the economic downturn of 2022 would have severely impacted our\nfinancial performance.\nOur focus paid off, and in 2022 our existing podcast business grew by\n900 per cent in terms of audience size, and revenues climbed by more than\n300 per cent.\nIn the world of business, teams like ours often devote months to\nmeticulously outlining how and why their ideas will succeed. Yet they\nseldom allocate the same level of time to examining the potential reasons\nwhy their ideas might not work. This is where the power of a simple\nquestion – ‘Why is this a bad idea?’ – comes into play.\nBy posing this question, we encourage an essential form of critical\nthinking that unveils risks and challenges often obscured by the\naforementioned five innate human biases. Rather than merely seeking\nvalidation for our ideas, we challenge ourselves to confront their"

    "raw_text": "weaknesses head-on. Our intention is not simply to find reasons to abandon\nan idea, but rather to embrace the adage that prevention is better than cure.\nIdentifying potential issues before embarking on a project enables us to\naddress and circumvent them, paving the way for a smoother journey to\nsuccess.\nTHE PR E-M O R TEM  M ETHO D : YO U R\nSECR ET W EAPO N FO R  AV O ID ING FAILU R E\nRegrettably, human nature often prevents us from thinking or acting pre-\nemptively to avoid worst-case scenarios. Many of us neglect to adopt\nhealthy habits, such as proper exercise and nutrition, until our wellbeing is\nin jeopardy; we overlook the importance of keeping our car maintained\nuntil we face a breakdown; and we won’t replace a damaged roof until\nwater droplets pitter-patter on our heads.\nThe post-mortem examination, or autopsy, is a procedure undertaken by\nmedical professionals to determine the cause of death by examining a body.\nA ‘pre-mortem’ is the hypothetical opposite of a post-mortem – you do it\nbefore the death has occurred. The ‘pre-mortem method’ is a decision-\nmaking technique developed by scientist Gary Klein, which encourages a\ngroup to think from a place of failure, before a project has begun. Instead of\nsimply asking ‘What could go wrong?’, the pre-mortem relies on you\nimagining that the ‘patient’ has died and asks you to explain what did go\nwrong.\nNow, imagine if we could harness this concept and apply it to our daily\nlives and professional endeavours. Scientific research shows that this\nsimple thought experiment – performing a metaphorical ‘autopsy’ before a\ncalamity occurs – can drastically reduce the chance of failure altogether.\nIn a groundbreaking 1989 study, researchers delved into the fascinating\nworld of the pre-mortem method and its impact on predicting outcomes.\nParticipants were split into two groups: one group harnessed the power of\nthe pre-mortem method to envision various business, social and personal\n\f\nevents as if they had already unfolded, and dissect the possible reasons that\nthey hadn’t succeeded. In contrast, the other group merely made predictions\nwithout any direction at all.\nThe group employing the pre-mortem method exhibited significantly\nhigher accuracy in predicting how the given scenarios would play out and\ndetermining the causes of those outcomes. These findings show that by\ncontemplating failure in advance, we can better comprehend its potential\norigins and take proactive measures to avoid it.\nAn additional study conducted in 1989 by researchers at two\nuniversities found the same stark results – this simple method of imagining\nthat a failure has already occurred increased the ability to correctly identify\nthe reasons for the future outcome by 30 per cent!\nSince 2021, I’ve implemented the pre-mortem analysis across all my\ncompanies to great success. Here is the five-step process I use to deploy the\npre-mortem method:\n1. SET THE STAGE: Gather relevant team members and clearly\nexplain the purpose of the pre-mortem analysis – to identify\npotential risks and weaknesses, not to criticise the project or\nindividuals.\n2. FAST-FO R W AR D  TO  FAILU R E: Ask your team to\nimagine that the project has failed and encourage them to visualise\nthe scenario in vivid detail.\n3. BR AINSTO R M  R EASO NS FO R  FAILU R E:\nInstruct each team member to independently generate a list of\nreasons that could have led to the project’s failure, considering both\ninternal and external factors. It’s important that this is done\nindependently and on paper to avoid groupthink.\n\f\n4. SHAR E AND  D ISCU SS: Have each team member share\ntheir reasons for failure, fostering an open and non-judgemental\ndiscussion to uncover potential risks and challenges.\n5. D EV ELO P CO NTINGENCY PLANS: Based on the\nidentified risks and challenges, work together to create contingency\nplans and strategies to either mitigate or avoid these potential pitfalls\naltogether.\nTHIS ISN’T JU ST BU SINESS ADV ICE, IT’S LIFE\nADV ICE\nThe truth is, humans make really shitty decisions – decisions clouded in\nemotion, induced by fear and influenced by insecurity. We’re not very\nlogical, we’re riddled with biases, and in our decision-making, we’re\nalways searching for shortcuts.\nThe power of the pre-mortem method extends far beyond the realm of\nbusiness; it’s been a potent tool for making better decisions in various\naspects of my personal life. Having robust decision-making frameworks has\nallowed me to make more effective and less regrettable decisions in the\nmost important areas of my life at the most important moments in my life.\nHere’s how you can apply it in different scenarios:\n1. CHO O SING A CAR EER  PATH: When deciding on a\ncareer, conduct a pre-mortem analysis by envisioning yourself years\ninto the future, having experienced significant dissatisfaction or\nfailure in that career. Work backwards to identify potential reasons\nfor this dissatisfaction, such as lack of interest in the job, limited\ngrowth opportunities or work-life imbalance. By considering these\nfactors, you can refine your career choice or devise strategies to\nmitigate potential issues.\n\f\n2. CHO O SING A PAR TNER : When contemplating a long-\nterm relationship or marriage, imagine a scenario in which the\nrelationship has failed or become unfulfilling. Identify factors that\nmay have contributed to the decline, such as misaligned values, poor\ncommunication, intimacy problems or differing expectations. By\naddressing these concerns proactively and proactively searching for\nred flags, you can make a more informed decision about the\npartnership or work on strengthening the relationship from the\noutset.\n3. M AKING A CO NSID ER ABLE INV ESTM ENT:\nWhen contemplating a significant investment, such as purchasing a\nhome or investing in the stock market, envision a scenario in which\nthe investment leads to financial loss. Identify potential causes for\nthis outcome, such as market fluctuations, inadequate research, or\noverestimating your financial capacity ahead of time. By\nunderstanding these risks, you can make more informed decisions,\nperform thorough due diligence, and take steps to minimise potential\nlosses.\nIn the present age, it appears that every social media quote I encounter\ndemands that I ‘visualise success’, extolling the virtues of ‘manifestation’\nand ‘positive thinking’. While optimism undoubtedly holds immense value\nand positive thinking has genuine merit, there lies an equally profound\npotency in embracing negative contemplation – visualising failure and\nplanning accordingly.\nTHE LAW : THE PO W ER  O F NEGATIV E\nM ANIFESTATIO N\nOur cognitive wiring instinctively steers us away from thoughts that induce\npsychological unease.

The allure of exploring uncharted territories in different\nindustries was too strong to resist. The idea of slipping back into the\nfamiliar shoes of a social media marketing CEO didn’t spark the same fire\nwithin me as it had a decade ago. More importantly, I yearned to break free\nfrom the limiting professional labels society assigns us – generic job titles\nlike lawyer, accountant, dentist, social media manager or graphic designer. I\nbelieved that such labels constrict our potential, ultimately leading to a\nsense of unfulfillment.\nI get it – labels act as shortcuts, they make us feel understood, they tell\nus that we belong somewhere, and they subtly reassure us that we have a\n\f\npurpose in this world. However, these labels also become professional\nshackles, stifling our creativity and narrowing the scope of our experiences.\nAt 27, I was far too young to be confined by any label. The only one I\nwas willing to give myself was ‘curious guy with a diverse set of skills’. I\naspired to work on broader societal challenges, rather than solely aiding\ncompanies in boosting sales for sneakers, carbonated beverages or\nelectronic gadgets.\nAnd so, my exciting new chapter began.\nWell, not really  . . .\nI have always been fascinated, concerned by and deeply curious about\nthe global mental health crisis, its causes and potential solutions.\nIn 2020, the year I resigned, the Covid-19 pandemic forced the world\ninto lockdown, depriving us of many psychological stabilisers and pushing\nmental health into the spotlight of public conversation. With time on my\nhands, I began a digital expedition through various intriguing subjects\nrelating to mental health, the most captivating of which was the world of\npsychedelics.\nI devoured countless research papers, clinical studies and online articles\nabout the efficacy of certain psychedelic compounds in treating mental\nhealth disorders in humans. The science and untapped potential of these\ncompounds left me completely awestruck.\nLife sometimes presents us with inexplicable moments of serendipity,\nchance encounters and seemingly aligned stars, and what I’m about to say\nnext is certainly one of them.\nJust days after completing my deep dive into the world of psychedelics,\nI received a text from a business acquaintance asking, ‘Hey Steven, could\nyou retweet this for me?’ To my astonishment, the link led to a news story\nabout the IPO (Initial Public Offering – a stock launch) of a psychedelic\ncompany I had just been researching! I responded, ‘I’ve spent weeks\nreading about this company – I’m fascinated by it. Are you involved?’ He\nreplied, ‘I’m the largest shareholder, and I’m working on a similar project\nright now. I’d love for you to help us with the marketing!’\n\f\n‘Let’s discuss this further,’ I replied, and we arranged a lunch meeting\nlater that week. After spending just a few hours learning about the\ncompany’s mission, meeting the executive team and examining their work,\nI knew I wanted to be part of their journey.\nThe company operated within the ‘biotech’ sector, an industry teeming\nwith brilliant minds – intelligent individuals donning white coats in\nlaboratories – yet devoid of cutting-edge marketing talent adept at crafting\ncompelling stories on the modern digital platforms that drive public\nconversation.\nTo succeed in their impending IPO, the company knew it needed to\neffectively communicate their incredibly timely cultural mission, not only\nto large institutional investors but also to the general public, using all the\navailable social media platforms.\nThe company had its sights set on a multi-billion-dollar IPO, and the\ndistinction between effective and ineffective storytelling and marketing\ncould make or break their valuation.\nI possessed the expertise they required.\nWith experience across every digital platform and having worked with\nleading brands in nearly every industry, I was the perfect candidate to help\nthem tackle this challenge. A week after our meeting, I offered to join the\ncompany for the nine months leading up to the IPO.\nMy responsibilities would include crafting the marketing strategy,\ndefining the brand, assembling the long-term marketing team, setting the\nteam’s philosophy and laying the foundation for all marketing efforts before\nmy departure. They accepted my proposal and promised to send me an offer\nthe next day.\nTo be honest, my motivation for joining their company wasn’t\nmonetary. If anything, I was eager to invest in the company because of my\ngrowing belief in the power of psychedelics. I wanted to immerse myself in\nthe science – surround myself with pioneers at the forefront of the sector,\nfill my knowledge bucket and quench my curiosity while I decided what to\ndo next in my career.\n\f\nThe following day, I awoke to an email from the company with the\nsubject line ‘remuneration package’. As I read the contents of the email, my\neyes narrowed in disbelief. They were offering me a potential $6–8 million\nin stock options on top of a monthly salary to lead their marketing efforts\nfor nine months, up until the stock market listing. This was more than ten\ntimes my expectation.\nIn this moment, I learned four enduring lessons about the value of any\nskill.\n1. Our skills hold no intrinsic value.\nOur skills are worth nothing. As the phrase goes, value is what someone is\nwilling to pay.\n2. The value of any skill is determined by the context in which it is\nrequired.\nEvery skill holds a different value in a different sector.\n3. The perception of a skill’s rarity influences how much people value it.\nIn the biotech sector, my high-level social media and marketing skills were\nakin to a diamond in the rough – so rare that companies were more than\nwilling to pay a premium for them. However, when I had sold these same\nskills in other industries – such as e-commerce, consumer goods and\ntechnology – in my previous role, their perceived value was significantly\ndiminished. In these contexts, my skills were more common, which meant\nthat the fees I could charge were a tenth of what a client was willing to pay\nme in the biotech industry.\n4. People will assess the worth of your skill based on how much value\nthey believe it can generate for them.\n\f\nThe biotech company was teetering on the edge of a potential multi-billion-\ndollar IPO, and in this high-stakes environment, my skills possessed the\npotential to substantially influence the company’s valuation. Naturally, they\nwere prepared to pay accordingly for such an impact.\nReflecting on my prior career, I realise that when I had used the same\nskills to market consumer products like dresses, T-shirts and accessories,\nthe financial returns I generated for clients paled in comparison to the\npotential returns for this biotech company. Consequently, the fees I received\nwere proportionally tiny.\n \n  \nThe truth is, the market you decide to sell your skills in will determine how\nmuch you get paid far more than the skills themselves. Technical or medical\nwriters in the engineering or biotech sectors earn higher salaries than\nwriters in the media and publishing industries, even though the core skill of\nwriting is the same.\nData analysts working in finance or consulting earn more than those in\nacademia or government roles, even when performing the same data\nanalysis tasks.\nSoftware developers and programmers in high-demand industries such\nas artificial intelligence, cybersecurity or fintech command higher salaries\nthan those working in traditional IT roles or web development, even when\nutilising the same programming languages.\nProject managers in the technology sectors receive higher pay than\nthose managing projects in the arts, education or social services sectors,\nthough the fundamental skill of project management is the same.\nSales professionals in high-value industries like pharmaceuticals,\nmedical devices or real estate can earn significantly more through\ncommissions and bonuses than those in retail or consumer goods, despite\nboth roles requiring the same fundamental sales skill.\nPR professionals working in entertainment, sports or luxury brands have\nhigher earning potential than those in non-profit organisations, healthcare or\n\f\neducation, even when using the same skills to manage PR campaigns.\nPhotographers working in fashion, advertising or commercial\nphotography can charge higher rates than those in photojournalism or\nwedding photography, even though the fundamental skill is very similar.\nHR professionals in industries with higher revenue and growth, such as\ntechnology or finance, earn more than their counterparts in non-profit or\npublic sectors, despite performing the same HR functions, like recruitment,\ntraining and benefits administration.\nFinancial analysts working in investment banking, private equity or\nhedge funds are likely to earn more than those in corporate finance or\ngovernment roles, even when applying the same financial analysis skills\nand knowledge.\nA common misconception is that the only avenues for securing a pay\nincrease are to either vie for a promotion in one’s current position or to seek\na similar role within the same industry. However, a more effective and\npotentially rewarding approach may lie in transplanting one’s skill set to\nan entirely new context – a different industry – where it can deliver greater\nvalue for the employer. By doing so, your current abilities may be seen as a\nrarer commodity, increasing their worth and, in turn, enhancing your value.\nMaybe the starkest example of how context creates the perception of\nvalue can be seen in a social experiment conducted by the Washington Post\nin 2007. The experiment was designed to explore how people perceive and\nvalue talent and art in an everyday, unexpected setting.\nOn a bustling January morning, Joshua Bell, a world-renowned\nviolinist, dressed in ordinary attire, disguised himself as a street performer\nand positioned himself at a Washington DC subway station. He played for\nabout 45 minutes, performing six classical pieces on his Stradivarius violin,\nwhich was worth $3.5 million at the time.\nDespite Bell’s immense talent, skill and the beautiful music he played,\nvery few of the thousands of commuters passing by that day stopped to\nlisten or appreciate his performance. Over the course of his performance,\nonly seven people paused to listen for at least a minute and Bell collected a\n\f\nmere $52.17 – a stark contrast to the thousands of dollars he typically earns\nper minute when performing in the world’s most prestigious concert halls.\nThe story highlighted how people often overlook value in certain\ncontexts, raising questions about how good we truly are at appreciating and\nrewarding talent in our daily lives.\nThis also serves as an apt metaphor for my own professional life; I had\npreviously been selling my skills in a subway station – and just by moving\nthe same skills to a prestigious concert hall, I earned ten times more.\nIn 2021 I shared this story and what it taught me with one of my best\nfriends, who was at an impasse in his career – sick of not having enough\nmoney for a mortgage, but seemingly working every available hour in the\nday. At the time he was a graphic designer designing nightclub flyers and\nlocal company logos in Manchester for £100–£200 a piece – he was\naveraging about £35,000 a year in income. A few weeks after our\nconversation, he made a bold decision to sell his skill set in a new context –\nhe moved to Dubai and repositioned his design service to focus on luxury\nbrands and blockchain technology companies.\nIn his first year in Dubai he generated £450,000 in revenue and in 2023\n– alongside his new business partner – he’s forecasting more than £1.2\nmillion in revenue.\nThe same skill of graphic design, sold in a different context, earning\nthirty times more.\nTHE LAW : YO U R  SKILLS AR E W O R THLESS,\nBU T YO U R  CO N TEXT IS V ALU ABLE\nDifferent markets will place different values on your skills. If an employer\nor client sees your expertise as rare or unique, they will be willing to pay\nmore for it than those in an industry in which your skill set is more\ncommon. Context is key – you can significantly boost your earning\npotential by offering the same skills to a different industry.\n\f\nTo be considered the best in your industry,\nyou don’t need to be the best at any one\nthing. You need to be good at a variety of\ncomplementary and rare skills that your\nindustry values and that your competitors\nlack."

    "raw_text": "LAW 27\nTHE DISCIPLINE EQUATION: DEATH, TIME\nAND DISCIPLINE!\nThis law teaches you how to be disciplined in anything that you set your\nmind to through a simple ‘discipline equation’, and why discipline is the\nultimate secret to being successful in any ambition we have.\nThese might be the most uncomfortable pages you read in this book.\nI’m 30 years old. Which means if I’m fortunate enough to live to the\ncurrent (US) life expectancy of roughly 77 years old, I have just 17,228\ndays left. It also means I’ve already spent 10,950 days, which I have no way\nof getting back.\nHere’s a breakdown of how many days you have left if you live to the\naverage (US) life expectancy, and how many you’ve already spent.\nAge (Years) Days Spent Days Left\n5 1,825 26,315\n10 3,650 24,455\n15 5,475 22,630\n\f\nAge (Years) Days Spent Days Left\n20 7,300 20,805\n25 9,125 18,980\n30 10,950 17,228\n35 12,775 15,403\n40 14,600 13,650\n45 16,425 11,825\n50 18,250 10,073\n55 20,075 8,248\n60 21,900 6,570\n65 23,725 4,745\n70 25,550 3,131\n75 27,375 1,306\n\f\nFor most of you, confronting this reality will be unsettling. As I detailed in\nmy first book, Happy Sexy Millionaire, as humans we seem hard-wired to\navoid the topic of death, treating it as a taboo subject, much like sex in the\nVictorian era. We seem to view death as an event that occurs only to others\nand we seemingly lack the emotional strength to accept our own mortality\nuntil a tragic diagnosis forces us to.\nIt’s my sincere belief that there are many things the human mind is\nincapable of truly grasping: one of them is how insignificant we are – life at\nevery touchpoint will seduce us into overestimating the importance of day-\nto-day things, and another is that we are actually going to die someday. Yes,\nlogically we know death is a thing – we’ve seen it happen to animals,\nrelatives and other people, but if you look closely at the things we\npreoccupy ourselves with, how we treat others, how we hoard possessions,\nhow we worry, you’ll see that we have both overestimated our own\nimportance and, at some deeper level, seem to believe we’re going to live\nfor ever.\nScientists have long said that as humans we struggle to comprehend\ninfinity, but perhaps we are also blind to the concept of finality and the\ninescapable truth that our journey will one day come to an end.\nOur innate assumption that life will continue for ever likely evolved as a\npsychological mechanism to alleviate anxiety, encourage forward-thinking\nand ultimately enhance our chances of survival. In essence, if humans were\npersistently conscious of their own mortality, they might be more\nsusceptible to paralysing anxiety, making it difficult to concentrate on other\ncrucial tasks such as securing life-sustaining resources like food and shelter.\nHowever, in today’s fast-paced digital world, we are constantly\nbombarded with a myriad of stimuli – news, social media, emails and\ncountless notifications – that often cause us to worry, project ourselves into\nthe future, fall into meaningless distraction, become disconnected and\nperpetually float in a state of unease.\nPerhaps the antidote to this modern ailment lies in embracing our\nmortality. By acknowledging our finite nature, we can prioritise what\ntruly matters, shed what doesn’t and foster the calm sense of urgency that\n\f\nhelps us focus on living more fully, authentically and in line with our most\nimportant values.\nI need to borrow your imagination for just a second. Imagine waking up\nin the middle of the night in a friend’s apartment on the 20th floor of an old\nhigh-rise building to the sounds of screams and the smell of smoke. Imagine\nstumbling to the door to try and escape to find it locked, realising the\nwindows are locked too and that there is no way out. Imagine eventually\ngiving in to the fire, losing consciousness and dying.\nWhen researchers asked groups of people to imagine this exact scenario\nin a 2004 study, and then to answer some questions about it, they\ndiscovered that participants’ gratitude levels skyrocketed. People who\nundergo these ‘death reflection’ exercises report greater life satisfaction, a\nstronger desire to spend time with loved ones, an increase in motivation to\nachieve meaningful goals, increased kindness, increased generosity and a\ngreater willingness to cooperate with others. They also reported lower\nlevels of anxiety and stress compared to a control group.\nYou’re going to die, and in a distracted, noisy, complex modern world\nthis truth is therapeutic, liberating and a wonderful way to stay focused on\nanother important truth, which is that your time – and how you choose to\nspend it – is the only influence you have on the world.\nThe allocation of your time will\ndetermine if you succeed or fail in your\nlife’s work, if you’ll be healthy and happy,\nif you’ll be a successful partner, husband,\nwife or parent. Our time - and how we\nallocate it - is the centre point of our\ninuence.\n\f\nEarlier, I said that humans struggle to comprehend abstract concepts like\nfinality, infinity and our own insignificance, but we also cannot\ncomprehend time itself. It slowly creeps, intangibly and invisibly,\nsomewhere out of sight. In order to make it perceptible enough for us to\nappreciate it, I created a mental model that I’m prompted to reflect on every\nday by a small roulette-wheel clock that sits on my office desk. I call this\nmental model ‘time betting’.\nTIME BETTING\nWe are all gamblers, stood over the roulette table of life.\nIn this gamble that is life, the number of betting chips we hold is equal\nto the number of hours we have left to live. As a 30-year-old, I’m likely\nholding about 400,000 chips, but I don’t know for certain – nobody does. I\ncould have just one left, I could have 500,000.\nThe one rule of the game is that we have to place one chip every hour,\nand once a chip is placed, we will never get it back. The wheel is always\nspinning, and how we place our bets determines the type of rewards we win\nfrom life.\nWe can place these chips on whatever we like; you might place them on\nwatching Netflix, going to the gym, cooking, dancing, spending quality\ntime with your partner, building a business, learning a skill, raising a child\nor walking a dog.\nHow you place these chips is the one thing in life we can control, and\nit’s the one factor that will have the greatest impact on shaping our success,\nhappiness, relationships, intellectual development, mental wellbeing and\nlegacy.\nAlthough you can never get your chips back once they’ve been placed,\nif you allocate some of your chips to activities that improve your health, the\ncroupier will hand you a few more chips.\nThe game ends when you run out of chips, and once the game is over,\nyou don’t get to keep any of the things you’ve won anyway.\n\f\nWith this in mind you should be conscious of what prizes you bet your\nchips trying to win – you should prioritise the things that bring you joy and\ndeprioritise trying to attain hard-fought prizes that deliver nothing more\nthan negativity, anxiety and illusion.\nIf I do have 400,000 chips left, I’ll likely bet 133,333 of those chips on\nsleep; if I meet the average I’ll place 50,554 chips on mindlessly scrolling\nthrough social media, 30,000 of them eating and drinking, and 8,333 chips\nin the bathroom. Which leaves me with about 200,000 chips – 200,000\nhours or about 8,000 days left to achieve my goals, build my relationships,\nraise my family, pursue my hobbies, travel, dance, learn, exercise, walk my\ndog and live the rest of my life.\nI say this not to scare you.\nI say this to help you realise how unbelievably important, precious and\nvaluable each chip – each hour of your day – is. It’s this crystal-clear\nrealisation of the importance of your time, caused by the crystal-clear\nrealisation of our impending death, that serves to motivate us to place every\nchip we have with clear intention – not to allow them to be snatched from\nyour hands unconsciously by digital, social and psychological distraction –\nbut to be placed considerately, chip by chip, on the things that truly matter\nthe most.\nAt 50 years of age, Steve Jobs delivered one of the most widely viewed\ncollege commencement speeches of all time. At the end of his speech, he\nsaid, ‘Remembering I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever\nencountered to help me make the big choices in life.’\nHaving overcome a life-threatening bout with cancer (although he\nultimately succumbed to the disease in 2011), he went on to argue that\n‘death is very likely the single best invention of life’. Jobs believed that the\ninevitability of death could inspire individuals to pursue their passions, to\ntake risks and to chart their own course in life. He implored his audience of\nstudents to avoid wasting their time living up to someone else’s\nexpectations, reminding them that their time was limited.\nOf all the things Steve Jobs could have said to those young,\nimpressionable college graduates, having just confronted his own mortality,\n\f\nhe felt that reminding them of their own impermanence was the most\nimportant thing to say.\nTHE DISCIPLINE EQUATION\nWhen writing this law, I had considered sharing some time-management\ntactics, tricks and hacks with you – there are more than I can name; the\npomodoro technique, time blocking, the two-minute rule, the Eisenhower\nMatrix, the ABCDE method, the Ivy Lee method, task batching, the Kanban\nmethod, the one-minute to-do list, the 1-3-5 rule, the timeboxing method,\nthe Seinfeld Strategy, the four Ds of time management, the two-hour\nsolution, the action method, and the list goes on.\nHere’s the truth: the reason why there are so many time-management\n‘methods’, ‘techniques’ and ‘strategies’ is the same reason why there are so\nmany fad diets – because frankly and fundamentally, none of them actually\nsolve the problem – there is no time-management system, procrastination-\nending method or productivity hack that’s going to give you the underlying\nthing you need in order to stay the course, make the right decisions and\nfocus on what matters over the long term – discipline.\nIf you have discipline, any of the hundreds of available methods, hacks\nand tricks will work. If you have no discipline, none of them will work.\nSo instead of giving you productivity ‘methods’, which you won’t be\nable to stick to in the absence of discipline, let’s just talk about discipline.\nTo me, discipline is the ongoing\ncommitment to pursuing a goal,\nindependent of uctuating motivation\nlevels, by consistently exercising self-\n\f\ncontrol, delayed gratication and\nperseverance.\nThe psychological reasons for long-term discipline can be multifaceted and\ninfluenced by a combination of personal traits, mindset, emotional\nregulation and environmental factors.\nHowever, when I reflect on the key areas of my life where discipline has\nremained consistent across years and decades – with my health and fitness\nregime, with building my companies, with my romantic relationship and\neven with my family relationships – it’s clear that there are three central\nfactors to discipline, which form what I call the discipline equation:\n1. Your perceived value of achieving the goal.\n2. How psychol\u0000gically rewarding and enga\u0000ing the process of\npursuing the goal is.\n3. How psychol\u0000gically costly and disenga\u0000ing the process of pursuing\nthe goal is.\nDISCIPLINE = THE VALUE OF THE GOAL +\nTHE REWARD OF THE PURSUIT - THE COST OF\nTHE PURSUIT\nLet me use DJ’ing as an example, I’ve been learning to DJ for the last 12\nmonths. I show up, practise for an hour, five times a week, and I have done\nso with good consistency for the last 12 months.\nValue of the goal: I really want to become a DJ and produce my own\nsongs because I’m obsessed with music, I love the art of DJ’ing and after\ndoing my first show to six colleagues in my kitchen and then to 3,000\npeople at a rave, I’m hooked on how live music can make me and a room of\npeople feel amazing.\n\f\nThe reward of the pursuit: downloading new music every week,\nengaging in the challenge of mixing it in new ways and falling into the\ntherapeutic flow state of practice has been incredibly psychologically\nrewarding, and because of the power of progress (discussed in Law 29) –\nwhich highlights how the feeling of progress creates motivation – I’m\nextremely engaged in the process.\nThe cost of the pursuit: the time it takes to practise, the energy it\nrequires to focus and the mild anxiety I have to endure in order to perform\nin front of people.\nBecause the value of the goal and the reward of the pursuit outweigh the\ncost of the pursuit, my discipline – regardless of fluctuations in my\nmotivation – has remained robust.\nHOW TO INFLUENCE YOUR DISCIPLINE\nEQUATION\nThrough ignorance, insecurity and immaturity, I spent my late teens and\nearly adulthood doggedly pursuing monetary goals, social status and\nromantic relationships. As adults we tend to seek validation from the things\nthat made us feel invalid when we were younger, and for me it was all of\nthe above.\nWas I aware that my actions were fuelled by insecurity? Far from it. In\ntruth, I wasn’t ‘driven’ – I was dragged. Did I understand the actual goal I\nwas striving for? Certainly not. I believed that wealth, success and external\nvalidation were my goal, when in reality, the underlying goal was to quench\nmy deep-seated insecurities and childhood shame. I had no idea what was\ndragging me, and I didn’t know where I was being dragged to.\nI suspect this is the case for most people reading this book. I suspect\nmost of you aren’t truly, authentically and fundamentally clear on what your\ngoals are and why those goals truly matter to you.\nTo determine factor one in the discipline equation, your perceived value\nof achieving the goal, you need to get crystal clear on what your goal is, and\n\f\nestablish exactly why accomplishing that goal intrinsically and\nauthentically matters to you. Doing this helps to set up systems and cues\nthat remind you of your goal’s value on an ongoing basis.\nThis is where visualisation has been scientifically proven to hold\ntremendous weight. Once we can see ourselves there, and we visualise it as\na great place to be, the perceived value (factor one) of getting there\nincreases.\nThe average person spends 3.15 hours a day on their mobile phone; for\nme it’s more than 5 hours a day, so I’ve converted the wallpaper of my\nphone into a visualisation mood board. If you’re staring at a phone screen\nfor 3 hours a day, having wallpaper that reinforces the perceived value of\nthe goals in your life can have a tremendous subconscious influence.\nFor factor two in the discipline equation, how rewarding the pursuit of\nthe goal is, you must do everything you can to enjoy the process and deploy\npsychological tactics to keep your engagement high.\nI’ve managed to stay disciplined with going to the gym for three\nconsecutive years, six days a week. Not only does my physiology reward\nme with a natural dopamine boost every time I train, but I’ve intentionally\ncreated accountability and gamification systems to maximise my\nengagement with the process.\nI’ve created something called ‘the fitness blockchain’, which is\nessentially a WhatsApp group containing ten of my friends and colleagues,\nwhere every day we submit a screenshot of our workout taken from a\nwearable fitness tracker. At the end of the month the least consistent gym-\ngoer is evicted, and a new person is added by raffle; the top three most\nconsistent gym-goers are awarded gold, silver and bronze medals, and each\nmedal gives points that are added to our league table.\nThe daily conversations, the end-of-month medal ceremony, the jokes,\nthe connection, the jeopardy and the competition all create what is known\nas a social pact – a mutual agreement among individuals to support and\nhold each other accountable for achieving their goals. This gamification –\nincorporating game-like elements, such as rewards, points and challenges –"

With that – and the habit framework from Law 8\nthat highlights the power of cues – in mind I set up my DJ’ing equipment\non the kitchen table, in plain view for the whole year, and ensured that I\nonly had to press one button to turn the entire system on and begin to\npractise.\nHad it been packed away and required 20 minutes to set up each\nsession, or even set up in a spare room where I wouldn’t see it as often, I’m\nabsolutely convinced that my discipline would have faltered. The perceived\nfriction of the process is a burden on your chances of reaching your goal –\nyou must work to remove any factor that will add a psychological cost\nand/or disengage you from the process.\nRemember: discipline = the value of the goal + the reward of the\npursuit – the cost of the pursuit.\n\f\n‘We don’t have to be smarter than the\nrest. We have to be more disciplined than\nthe rest.’\nWarren Buffett\nTHE LAW: THE DISCIPLINE EQUATION:\nDEATH, TIME AND DISCIPLINE\nSuccess is not complicated, it’s not magic and it’s not a mystery. Luck,\nchance and fortune may give you a wonderful tailwind, but the rest will be a\nby-product of how you choose to use your time. Most of it hinges on\nfinding something that captivates us enough to persevere daily and a goal\nthat resonates profoundly enough to remain steadfast in our pursuit. Success\nis the embodiment of discipline – though it may not be easy, its core\nprinciples are beautifully simple."

    "raw_text": "Being selective about how you spend your\ntime, and who you spend your time with, is\nthe greatest sign of self-respect.\n\f\nPILLAR IV \nTHE TEAM\n\f\nLAW  28\nASK W HO  N O T HO W\nThis law shows how to create incredible companies, projects or\norganisations the easy way – without having to learn more or do more\nyourself.\nAt the other side of the table sat Richard Branson, one of the most famous\nentrepreneurs in the world, adventurer, space traveller and founder of Virgin\nGroup. I had attended a private screening of a new life-story documentary\nin the heart of Manhattan, and the next day I had asked him for two hours of\nhis time to interview him for The Diary Of A CEO. He explained:\nI was dyslexic and pretty hopeless at school; I just assumed that I\nmust be a little bit thick. I could just about add up and subtract. But\nwhen it got to more complicated stuff I couldn’t.\nI was in a board meeting at about 50 years old, and I said to the\ndirector, is that good news or bad news? And one of the directors\nsaid, ‘Come outside, Richard.’ I came outside and he said, ‘You\ndon’t know the difference between net profit and gross profit, do\nyou?’\nI said, ‘No.’\nHe said, ‘I thought not,’ and brought out a sheet of paper and\nsome colouring pens and he colours it in blue and then he puts a\nfishing net in it and then he puts a little fish in the fishing net. And\nhe says, ‘So, the fish that are in the net, that’s your profit at the end\n\f\nof the year, and the rest of the ocean, that’s your gross turnover.’\nAnd I went, ‘I got it.’\nIt really doesn’t matter. For somebody who’s running a\ncompany, what matters is can you create the best company in its\nsector? Somebody else can add up the figures. It helps to add up and\nsubtract, but if you can’t do those things, I wouldn’t worry too\nmuch. You can find somebody else that can.\nI’m just good with people. I can trust people. I surround myself\nwith really good people. That’s the thing with being dyslexic; I had\nno choice but to delegate.\nI sat there, stunned into silence. There was something incredibly liberating,\ninspiring and empowering to hear a multi-billionaire, rock star entrepreneur,\nwhose group consists of 40 companies, employing 71,000 people and\ngenerating $24 billion in annual sales, tell you that he can’t read well or do\nmaths well, and that it ‘doesn’t really matter’.\nThis admission was music to my ears, not only because it was\nhumanising and honest, but also because it made me feel less like a fraud\nmyself! By my 27th birthday, the company I’d founded was generating\nhundreds of millions in sales, we employed hundreds of people around the\nworld, and I spent most of my time flying between our offices in\nContinental Europe, the UK and America. But, somewhere deep inside me,\nI had a nagging feeling that I wasn’t a real CEO because I’m not brilliant at\nmaths, spelling or most of the operational aspects of running a business. For\nthe last ten years, I’ve focused my energy on creating the best products I\ncan, and I’ve delegated anything I don’t like doing and can’t do (usually the\nsame thing) to someone who is much more capable, experienced and\nconfident.\nThis has always worked for me – I’ve long given up hope of becoming\nan expert in the things I’m not good at and don’t enjoy – but this\nperspective is inconsistent with the advice I hear from business schools,\nentrepreneurship books and success blogs, which typically assert that you\nneed to be good at a variety of things to become successful.\n\f\nI interviewed Jimmy Carr, the stand-up comedian, at my home in\nLondon, and he backed this point up with wisdom and hilarity:\nI think school teaches us maybe the wrong lesson. School teaches us\na lesson about mediocrity and being all-rounders. And yet we live in\na world that does not reward all-rounders. Who gives a fuck about\nall-rounders? If you get a D in physics and you get an A in English,\njust go to English lessons  . . . ‘We’ll get you to a C grade in\nphysics’  . . . I tell you what the world doesn’t need – someone\nwho’s shit at physics! So, find out what you’ve got a natural ability\nfor, what’s the thing that you do best and just lean in to that!\nThis statement by Jimmy seems to perfectly encapsulate the strategy I’ve\nfollowed over the last ten years. The truth is, as evidenced from my 31 per\ncent school attendance and subsequent expulsion, I’m really bad at doing\nthings I don’t enjoy, and that has proven to be a superpower because it’s\nallowed me to double and triple down on the few things I’m both good at\nand enjoy.\nIn business – especially if you have dreams of creating a really big\nbusiness – it’s not about learning how to do something, it’s about knowing\nwho can do it for you. Business is all about people. Every company,\nwhether they realise it or not, is simply a recruitment company. Every CEO\nand founder will be judged simply on their ability to 1. hire the best\nindividuals, and 2. bind them with a culture that gets the best out of them –\nwhere they become more than the sum of their parts, where 1 + 1 = 3. Had I\nhired a 16-year-old Richard Branson and created a culture that got the best\nout of him, I would have had a $20 billion company on my hands.\nFounders, especially inexperienced founders, have a tendency to\nhorrifically overstate their own importance – they fall into the trap of\nbelieving their outcomes will be decided by their own brilliance, ideas and\nskills.\n\f\nThe truth is, your destination will b e\ndened b y the sum total of the ingenuity,\nideas and execution of the group of\npeople that you assemb le.

In 1978 he\nbrainwashed his followers into believing that the world was about to end.\nOne day, following his instructions, more than 900 of his disciples – among\nthem women and children – ended their lives by drinking a cocktail of\ncyanide and the drink Kool-Aid.\nIT’S PR ETTY M U CH IM PO SSIBLE FO R  A\nBU SIN ESS TO  BECO M E A FU LL-BLO W N  CU LT\nCults are venal, sinister, manipulative and use psychological brainwashing\nto control their members. They require the type of leader who prevents\nfollowers from thinking for themselves. By contrast, modern businesses\n\f\noperating in a fast-changing, unpredictable, turbulent world require\nemployees at all levels to be able to think independently. The last thing you\nwant, as a leader today, is employees who are incapable of independent\nthought.\nAs Jim Collins has argued, though, in his landmark book Built to Last,\nthere is nothing wrong with a cult-like commitment from employees to\nspecific values. Collins found that architects of visionary companies\nintentionally encourage this, rather than relying purely on their employees’\nwork ethic, ideals or ability to execute their brief.\nCults are gruesome, evil and horrendous institutions. They prey on\npeople’s vulnerabilities, insecurities and faithfulness. I am by no means\nencouraging you to replicate their immorality, wickedness or delusion. I am,\nhowever, fascinated and perplexed by how a group of people can become so\ncommitted, devoted and dedicated to a cause, a brand or a mission that they\nwould make the fateful decision to give their life to it.\nI’ve sat with CEO after CEO of some of the world’s most adored\nbrands, a few of which that have – in their own words – a ‘cult following’.\nSome of them also have a ‘cult-like’ company culture, and others have\nreferred to a ‘cult mentality’ when the company was founded.\nPeter Thiel, the German-American billionaire entrepreneur and co-\nfounder of PayPal, said:\nEvery company culture can be plotted on a linear spectrum: the best\nstart-ups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults.\nThe biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong\nabout something important. People at a successful start-up are\nfanatically right about something those outside it have missed.\nWhy work with a group of people who don’t even like each\nother? Taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in\nwhich free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse\nthan cold: it’s not even rational. Since time is your most valuable\nasset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision\nany long-term future together.\n\f\nIf you look closely at the T-shirts people in San Francisco wear\nto work, you’ll see the logos of their companies – and tech workers\ncare about those very much. The start-up uniform encapsulates a\nsimple but essential principle: everyone at your company should be\ndifferent in the same way – a tribe of like-minded people fiercely\ndevoted to the company’s mission.\nAbove all, don’t fight the perk war. Anybody who would be\npowerfully swayed by free laundry pickup or pet day care would be\na bad addition to your team. Just cover the basics and then promise\nwhat no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a\nunique problem alongside great people.\nWe’ve all seen the throwback imagery of a small group of people huddled\naround computers in a shed, basement or apartment, building what would\ngo on to be the next big, billion-dollar company. They always seem to look\nreally tired and a little malnourished but incredibly focused. Facebook,\nAmazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple started this way, to name a few. All\nthese companies had cult-like attributes in their earliest years, and their\nfounders often attribute that religious dedication, conviction and obsession\nto their eventual success.\n‘The energy at a start-up is like being part\nof a movement or a cult.’\nKevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram\n‘W hen I was starting the company, I\nthought, “W ho wants to be in a cult? That\nsounds horrible.” But when you’re a start-\nup, that’s exactly what you want to create.\n\f\nYou want to create a company that people\nare really passionate about.’\nTony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos\n‘It’s kind of a cult, you know? The energy,\nthe cam\u0000raderie, the sense of mission and\npurpose.’\nEvan Williams, co-founder of Twitter\nTHE FO U R  STAGES O F BU ILD IN G A\nCO M PAN Y\nIt’s my belief – derived from my own experience launching more than ten\nsuccessful start-ups and my conversations with hundreds of successful\nfounders – that the best companies go through an evolutionary process,\nwhich does – although it may sound uninviting to some – initially resemble\na cult.\nThe four stages of a company’s life are the cult, growth, enterprise\nand decline phases. In the cult or ‘zero to one’ phase, the founding team\nmembers are typically so consumed by their delusional belief, enthusiasm\nand urgency, that they go ‘all-in’, sacrificing their social life, relationships\nand, unfortunately, their wellbeing, to try and get their baby off the ground.\nIn the growth phase, the company is a mess behind the scenes.\nEmployees are overworked, under-resourced and often inexperienced. They\ndon’t have the systems, processes or people they need to handle the growth,\nbut they feel like they’re on a rocket ship to somewhere great, so they hold\non to the ship with great excitement, terror and hope regardless.\nIn the enterprise phase, people are stable.

Each of them represents 10 per cent of your\ncompany culture, your values and your philosophy, so getting those ten\npeople right and binding them together with the right culture, will\nirreversibly define your company. When a culture is strong, new people\nbecome like the culture. When a culture is weak, the culture becomes like\nthe new people.

This is why companies that become great start out\nfeeling like cults – they were clear on their values, devoted to the cause and\nobsessed with solving a problem.\nAlthough that unsustainable mentality dilutes as it moves through its\ninevitable life cycle, its essence remains as a set of clear values that\ncontinue to permeate through everything the company does.\nSo the question becomes, what are the ingredients of a cult?\n1. A SEN SE O F CO M M U N ITY AN D  BELO N GIN G\nJoshua Hart, a professor of psychology at Union College who has studied\ncults, said, ‘They provide meaning, purpose and belonging.

A SHAR ED  M ISSIO N\n‘A cult is a group or movement with a shared commitment to a usually\nextreme ideology,’ says Janja Lalich, an expert in cultic studies.

Cults in any context – and especially in business – are\nfundamentally unsustainable, emotionally gruelling and therefore\nineffective at achieving long-term objectives in business and life. The most\nimportant overarching principle for anyone hoping to achieve a long-term\nbusiness goal is to create a culture that is sustainable; where people are\nauthentically engaged with a mission they care about; trusted with a high\ndegree of autonomy; sufficiently challenged in their work; given a sense of\nforward motion and progress; and surrounded by a caring, supportive group\nof people that they love to work with and that provide them with\n‘psychological safety’.\nIf you can achieve this, you’re setting yourself up for long-term success.\n\f\nTHE LAW : CR EATE A CU LT M EN TALITY\nA cult-like mentality, and cult-like commitment from staff, can be\nincredibly useful in the beginning stages of a start-up; it can determine the\nculture and generate the passion required to launch a new business. But as a\ncompany grows, it needs to develop in order to achieve longer-term\nobjectives – cults are not sustainable.\n\f\nIf the culture is strong, new people will\nbecome like the culture.\nIf the culture is weak, the culture will\nbecome like the new people.\n\f\nLAW  30\nTHE THR EE BAR S FO R  BU ILD IN G GR EAT\nTEAM S\nThis law shows you how the greatest leaders in the world decide who to\nhire, fire and promote in their organisations and why you need to put\nculture before everything when building a team.\nSir Alex Ferguson is widely considered to be the greatest football manager\nof all time. During his 26 years at the head of Manchester United he won 38\ntrophies, and in the summer of 2013, after winning the Premier League one\nlast time, he announced he was retiring at the age of 71.\nWhen he first joined the struggling side in 1986, he said ‘The most\nimportant thing at Manchester United is the culture of the club. The culture\nof the club comes from the manager.’ He emphasised that culture and\nvalues – not just players and tactics – determine a team’s success. He said\nthat these values must be instilled in players from the moment they join the\nteam, and must be upheld by everyone at the club, from the players and\ncoaches to the staff and executives.\nA few years ago, Patrice Evra, a player who joined Ferguson’s winning\nManchester United side in 2006, told me that the manager met him in the\nbackroom of an airport in France ahead of potentially signing him to join\nthe team.\n‘Sir Alex wanted to look in my eyes and ask me one question. He\nlooked at me with a steely stare and said, “Are you willing to die for this\n\f\nclub?” I replied “Yes”, and he immediately reached across the table and\nsaid, “Welcome to Manchester United, son!” ’\nFerguson believed that creating a strong, united culture within the club\nwould result in a winning team on the pitch and build a sustainable success\nover the long term. He was right. No football manager, before or after, has\never managed to dominate with such stability, consistency and success as\nFerguson did.\nA hallmark of his philosophy was to never let individual players get in\nthe way of his team ethos, culture or values. He became known for saying\nthe phrase ‘nobody is bigger than the club’ in press conferences, and\nunexpectedly transferring any player that no longer embodied the ‘United\nway’, regardless of how well they were playing, how famous they were or\nhow much he needed them.\nI’ve interviewed five former Manchester United players over the last\nfew years, and all of them said that one of Ferguson’s greatest strengths was\nhis ability to move star-players on – even when they were at the peak of\ntheir powers.\nRio Ferdinand told me:\nJaap Stam was the best defender in the world at the time, and Sir\nAlex said, ‘See you later’. David Beckham was in the form of his\ncareer and he let him go! Ruud van Nistelrooy was the top goal\nscorer at United and he shipped him out the team! The man just saw\nsomething early.\nUnder Ferguson’s leadership, Beckham became widely considered as the\nbest right-sided midfielder in Europe. But Ferguson grew weary of the\nconstant paparazzi that hounded Beckham following his marriage to pop\nstar Victoria. When his popularity skyrocketed in Manchester, and Beckham\nbecame a growing distraction, it was against everything Sir Alex wanted for\nhis team’s culture and – the next summer – Beckham was sold to Real\nMadrid.\n\f\nAnother example was Keane, who was United’s captain of a golden era,\nwinning seven titles with the club and steering them to win the treble (FA\nPremier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League) in 1999. But after\ntraining-ground arguments and outbursts in interviews in which he\ncriticised teammates, the outspoken midfielder ended up falling out with\nFerguson and was sold to Celtic in 2005.\nRuud van Nistelrooy was one of the most prolific goal scorers in\nUnited’s history. But when he stormed out of the stadium after being\nbenched on the last game of the season, he was never seen at Manchester\nUnited ever again.\nYour average manager, in sport or in business, wouldn’t have the guts,\nforesight and conviction to make such bold pivotal decisions – sacking your\nmost valuable employee because they’re challenging your culture is a\nproblematic thing to do. But every truly great sport or business manager\nthat I’ve interviewed instinctively knows that the even more problematic\nthing is letting one ‘bad apple’ spoil the rest, regardless of their talent.\n‘The hardest thing I had to learn was to\nre people. You must do it to protect the\nintegrity of the company and the culture\nof the team.’\nRichard Branson\nBarbara Corcoran is the 73-year-old American businesswoman, Shark Tank\ninvestor, and founder of a billion-dollar New York real estate empire. In my\ninterview with her, she stressed how critically important it is to remove\n‘toxic influences’ from your team, before they infect your other ‘children’\n(employees):\nI couldn’t wait to fire individuals who were negative and didn’t fit.\nThey were ruining my good kids. People who are negative always\n\f\nneed somebody to be negative with them. You’ve got to get rid of\nthem. I never carried a negative person that didn’t fit the culture for\nmore than a couple of months. These people are thieves in the night,\nthey take your energy away, and your most valuable asset is your\nenergy.\nHesitating to fire someone that I knew was a net negative for my companies\nculture is my single biggest regret in business. As Corcoran highlights,\nthese people are contagious – they have the toxic power to turn younger,\nhigh-potential, great team members into negative, average worriers.\n‘The cost of one bad apple can be the loss\nof many good ones.’\nCEO of General Electric\nHarvard Business Review undertook a study into the effects of bad\nemployees on a business. The study aimed to understand how new ideas\nand behaviours can spread among co-workers. Using regulatory filings and\nemployee complaints, the study found that employees were 37 per cent\nmore likely to commit misconduct at work when they encountered a new\nco-worker who had a history of misconduct themselves. Incredibly, this\nstudy shows that toxic employees really are contagious. Results show that\nmisconduct in the workplace has a social multiplier of 1.59, which means\nthat each case of misconduct in a company – like a virus – spreads and\nresults in an additional 0.59 cases of misconduct when a misbehaving\nemployee is allowed to remain.\nWill Felps, a former researcher at the University of Washington\nBusiness School, was asking his wife if things at her work were still\nbothering her. ‘They’re not in the office this week, and the atmosphere is so\nmuch better,’ she said.\nFelp’s wife was referring to a single co-worker who was particularly\ntoxic, regularly picking on and humiliating individuals in her team, which\n\f\nmade an already hostile working environment even worse. But when this\nemployee was off sick for a few days, a funny thing happened, recalls\nFelps.\nPeople started helping each other, playing classical music on their\nradios and going out for drinks after work. But when he returned to\nthe office, things returned to the unpleasant way they were. She\nhadn’t noticed this employee as being a very important person in the\noffice before he came down with this illness but, upon observing the\nsocial atmosphere when he was gone, she came to believe that he\nhad a profound and negative impact. He truly was the ‘bad apple’\nthat spoiled the barrel.\nIntrigued by the impact of this single individual on a wider team, Felps and\nhis colleague Terence Mitchell, a professor of business and psychology,\ncombed through 24 published studies about how teams and groups of\nemployees interact, and followed up with their own research to show just\nhow much a single ‘negative’ team member – someone who avoids taking\ntheir fair share of the work, bullies their teammates or is emotionally\nunstable – can derail an otherwise well-functioning team. And they’re more\ncommon than you might think: most people, it turns out, can think of at\nleast one ‘bad apple’ they’ve worked with in the course of their career.\nTheir study also indicated that most organisations do not have effective\nways of dealing with negative employees, particularly when the negative\nemployee has longevity, experience or power within the company.\nThey found that negative behaviour\ncompletely outweighed positive\nbehaviour, meani\u0000g that a single ‘bad\napple’ can spoil the team’s culture, while\n\f\none, two or three good workers cannot un-\nspoil it.\nThey concluded that when a ‘bad apple’ isn’t fired, it can lead to employee\ndisengagement, other employees copying the behaviour, social withdrawal,\nanxiety and fear. This culminates in a deterioration of trust within the team\nand further disengagement of team members.\nThe researchers discovered something I’ve learned time and time again\nthroughout my business career: no one person leaving a good company kills\nit, but sometimes one person staying can.\n‘A bad apple can ruin the barrel but it’s\nimportant to remember that the barrel\ncan be cleaned. It’s important to take\naction and remove toxic individuals to\nmaintain a positive culture.’\nOprah Winfrey\nTHE THR EE BAR S: FIR E, HIR E, TR AIN\nFiring someone is never easy. All of the aforementioned great leaders, who\nunderstand the importance of protecting a company culture at all costs, also\nspeak of the difficulty, agony and emotional turmoil of the experience when\nthey have to let someone go.

I call this my ‘three bars’ framework.\nIt starts with asking yourself (or your management team) a very simple\nquestion in relation to a specific team member: ‘If everyone in the\norganisation had the same cultural values, attitude and level of talent as this\nemployee, would the bar (the average) be raised, maintained, or lowered?’\nThis question doesn’t seek similarity in perspectives, experience or\ninterests, diversity of thought, lived experience, or worldview. But it does\nseek similarity in company cultural values, standards and attitude.\nThink of any team you’re in – a sports team, a creative team or the team\nyou’re in at work – and now think of one person at random in that team and\nask yourself, ‘If everyone in the team embodied their cultural values, would\nthe bar be raised, maintained or lowered?’\nOn this image I’ve plotted four hypothetical people using this question. It’s\nsimple: Michael – the bar lowerer – needs to be fired, and Oliver – the bar\nraiser – needs to be promoted into a management position. As the research\ndemonstrated, Michael will be a disproportionately toxic influence on team\nculture, and Oliver can become a disproportionally positive influence on\nteam culture if he’s given the chance to sit higher in the organisation.\n\f\nThis framework has also been incredibly useful when assessing new\nrecruits against current team standards.\nTHE LAW : THE THR EE BAR S FO R  BU ILD IN G\nGR EAT TEAM S\nWith every hire, you should be looking to raise the bar, and just like Sir\nAlex Ferguson did, if any current hire – regardless of how many trophies\nthey’ve won you in the past – becomes a bar lowerer, you must quickly and\ndecisively act to stop their influence destroying the sacred collective\nculture.\n\f\nThe denition of the word ‘company’ is\njust ‘group of people’.\n\f\nLAW  31\nLEV ER AGE THE PO W ER  O F PR O GR ESS\nThis law shows the most important force for team engagement, motivation\nand fulfilment in any organisation.

    "raw_text": "popularised by the story of the 2008 British Cycling team and their\ncontinued success across multiple Olympic Games.\nPrior to 2008, British Cycling was widely regarded as the laughing\nstock of the sport. In an effort to fix things, the governing body hired\nperformance director David Brailsford to transform the philosophy, strategy\nand culture of the team.\nBrailsford believed that 1 per cent improvements across all aspects of\ncycling would aggregate into a significant performance gain. Under his\nguidance, British Cycling stopped thinking about major steps forward and\nstarted obsessing over the smallest, easiest details: using antibacterial hand\ngel to cut down on infections, rubbing alcohol on bicycle tyres for better\ngrip, redesigning bike seats for greater comfort, changing the pillows in the\nathletes’ bedrooms to improve their sleep, extensive wind tunnel testing of\nbikes and racing suits, etc.\nBrailsford took over and within five years, British Cycling won 57 per\ncent of all road and track cycling gold medals at the 2008 Beijing\nOlympics, and at the 2012 London Olympics set seven world records and\nnine Olympic records! From 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world\nchampionships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured five\nTour de France victories. This made this ten-year span the most successful\nera for any cycling team in history!\nIn my interview with Brailsford, I asked him how focusing on small\nmarginal progress caused such tremendous motivation, success and\nconsistency, and he told me:\nPeople want a feeling of progression, and if we aim for perfection,\nwe’ll fail, because perfection is so far away.\nSo instead of perfection, let’s have a little progression, just a\nlittle, and that will make us feel good. So, let’s identify the basics,\nget them right and then next week ask ourselves, what other little\nthings could we do?\nThere are a million things that could impact a cycling\nperformance. Could we, I don’t know, change our diet to be slightly\n\f\nmore optimal than it is this week, and do that by next week? And\neverybody goes, yep, we could do that! OK. What else could we\ndo? Could we do more in the gym this week? Could we alter our\nattitude slightly? Could you do that? Yeah, we could do that. OK.\nSo off we go. And then you get to next week and ask, did we do all\nthat stuff? Yeah, we did. We haven’t moved a long way, but I tell\nyou what, it felt pretty good.\nAnd suddenly you kind of start to get this idea that you’re on the\nmove. And when you feel like you’re on the move, you feel good\nabout yourself. Tiny progress means a lot to people, and when they\nfeel it, they realise they can do it again tomorrow.\nWhereas when you’re trying to do something big, it’s less\nsustainable. We all go full gas in the gym in January and then of\ncourse by February, we’ve all stopped again. And why is that? It’s\nquite rare that you can make major change and make it sustainable,\nbut it’s quite easy to make small incremental changes and make\nthem stick. And it’s the stickability over time, I think, which makes\nthe big difference. We never ever thought about the podiums, or the\nfinish line, or trophies – we didn’t talk about that – we thought\nabout the smallest things we could do today to make progress.\nWhen you create this culture, people feel the progress, and\nthey’re energised. Even more ideas start coming to the surface from\nthe team and they get adopted too. And a narrative emerges in the\nteam that we’re on the move, we’re changing, we’re doing all the\nlittle things because we can be arsed to do the little things that other\npeople can’t be arsed to do. And that makes a difference.\nAnd I say that quite often in our team, we’ll be working late,\nand I say, right, guys, let’s just all get together for a minute. The\nreason we’ve been good, is because we can be arsed to do all these\nlittle things that all these other teams who are now locked up and\ngone to bed in their hotel, can’t be bothered to do. And it works, you\nknow, it works, 100 per cent it works, been at it 20 years. And it’s as\nmuch about that kind of enthusiasm and a positivity about\n\f\nembracing and not viewing small change as a chore. Progress is a\npowerful force.\nTHE SU PER PO W ER  O F SM ALL W IN S\nThe concept of progress is often perceived as a tangible outcome, yet\nresearch continues to show that the true motivational power of progress is\nmore feelings and emotions than facts and stats.\nAs researcher Teresa Amabile notes in the Harvard Business Review,\n‘On days when workers have the sense they’re making headway in their\njobs, or when they receive support that helps them overcome obstacles,\ntheir emotions are most positive and their drive to succeed is at its peak.’\nThe key phrase here is ‘when workers have the sense they’re making\nheadway’.\nHow much you’re actually achieving is\npretty much irrelevant to your\nmotivation: but if you feel like you’re\ngetting somewhere, you’ll be driven to\nkeep going.\nWhen joining a poorly motivated, struggling team, the collective\npsychology resembles that of a double-decker bus broken down on the side\nof the road with four flat tyres. Inspiration and collective belief is the\nenergy that all teams run on – it’s the cause of their drive, the air in their\ntyres and the fuel in their engine.\nSir David Brailsford understood this when he joined the failing British\nCycling team – he knew that making large tangible accomplishments\nmattered less at that point than giving the team the feeling that they were"

If we only waited for the big wins,\nwe would be waiting a long time. And we\nwould probably quit long before we see\nanything tangible come to fruition. W hat\nyou need instead of the big wins is simply\nthe forward momentum that small wins\nbring.’\nTeresa Amabile\nThrough her incredible research, which involved the analysis of nearly\n12,000 diary entries and daily rankings of motivation and emotions,\nAmabile found that ‘making progress in one’s work – even incremental\nprogress – is more frequently associated with positive emotions and high\nmotivation than any other workday event’.\nWhen I interviewed Nir Eyal, the author of the landmark book\nIndistractible, which uncovers why humans procrastinate, he asserted that\nthe sole reason why people procrastinate is because they’re trying to avoid\nsome form of ‘psychological discomfort’ in their life. The bigger the task\n\f\nand the less competent we feel about accomplishing it, the greater the\nprocrastination. That essay you have to write on a topic you don’t fully\nunderstand, that sensitive issue you have to confront in your relationship\nthat will likely result in a major argument, that business you want to launch\nwithout clarity on where you need to start – these challenges feel like\nmountains to climb; they cause tremendous psychological discomfort, so\nthey inspire tremendous procrastination.\nThe key to overcoming that discomfort\nand preventing procrastination is to\n‘smallify’ the task into easy, achievable\nmicro-goals.\nMaking goals sound and feel achievable is something the great\norganisational theorist Karl E. Weick has explored at length over his\ndecades of researching organisational life.\nIn 1984, Weick published a seminal paper that blamed society’s failure\nto solve big social issues on how we present the challenges to the world.\n‘The massive scale on which social problems are conceived often stops\ninnovation and action,’ he complained. ‘People often define social problems\nin ways that overwhelm their ability to do anything about them.’ He went as\nfar as to say that ‘people can’t solve problems unless they think they aren’t\n“problems” ’:\nWhen the magnitude of problems is scaled upward, the quality of\nthought and action declines, because processes such as frustration,\narousal, and helplessness are activated.\nTherefore, the key to action, confidence and movement is scaling your\nchallenge down."

But ‘a series of wins’\nbegins to reveal ‘a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and\nlower resistance to subsequent proposals’. Small wins ‘are compact,\ntangible, upbeat, and noncontroversial.’\nToo few leaders understand this.\nIn a seminal article published in the Harvard Business Review in 1968,\nAmerican psychologist Frederick Herzberg theorised that individuals are\nmost motivated in their jobs when they are provided with ‘opportunities for\nachievement’.\nHowever, when Harvard Business Review surveyed almost 700\nmanagers across various companies and industries worldwide, they\ndiscovered that most managers, leaders and CEOs simply didn’t believe or\nunderstand this.\nWhen asked to rank the tools most effective in impacting employee\nmotivation and emotions, a mere 5 per cent of respondents placed ‘making\nprogress in work’ as the primary motivator, with 95 per cent placing it last\nor third.\nInstead, the majority ranked ‘recognition for good work’ as the most\ncrucial factor in motivating workers and promoting happiness.

    "raw_text": "1. CR EATIN G M EAN IN G\nHumans have a deep-seated desire to do meaningful work. Steve Jobs used\nthis to his advantage in 1983, when trying to convince John Sculley that he\nshould leave his extremely successful job at PepsiCo to become Apple’s\nnew CEO, by asking him, ‘Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling\nsugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?’ His strategy\nwas successful – Sculley joined Apple shortly after – because it focused on\nthe meaningfulness of the work that Apple does. Making progress boosts\nyour professional motivation, but only if the work matters to you.\nIn all my companies over the last ten years, one of the most valuable\nthings we’ve done is put systems in place that make sure that every team\nmember, in every department, feels the meaningful impact the work is\nhaving on the world. In one company we have an internal workplace\nchannel called ‘Impact’, which is dedicated to sharing powerful stories,\ntestimonials and feedback about how each team member’s efforts has\nimpacted the lives of real people, all over the world.\nManagers cannot leave this to chance; in an increasingly digital world,\nwhere we’re dealing more in numbers, stats and screens, it’s easier than\never to lose sight of the meaning behind the metrics.\nW hen work feels meani\u0000gless, motivation\nevaporates.\nAccording to 238 diary entries by workers in a variety of industries, the\nfactor that kills meaning the fastest is a leadership team that dismisses an\nemployee’s work or ideas, removes their sense of ownership and autonomy\nand asks them to spend time on work that is cancelled, changed or\ndisregarded before it’s been completed.\n2. SETTIN G CLEAR  AN D  ACTIO N ABLE GO ALS\n\f\nIt’s important for leaders to lay out objectives clearly, so team members\nknow exactly what they need to accomplish. The goal should be broken\ndown into smaller, interim milestones, with a focus on early wins to build\nmomentum. Progress should be tracked to ensure small wins don’t go\nunnoticed.\nIn my companies we use OKRs (objectives and key results) – a periodic\ngoal-setting framework – across all teams to ensure that this happens.\n3. PR O V ID IN G AU TO N O M Y\nOnce the desired outcome is clear, leaders should give their team members\nspace to take charge. Encourage them to map their own path by utilising\ntheir skills and expertise.\nOne of the most important characteristics in all of my teams has been\nallowing people the space to both fail and succeed. My job as CEO is to\nplay the role of a supportive enabler, not a critical micromanager.\n4. R EM O V IN G FR ICTIO N\nLeaders should proactively remove any obstacles, bureaucracy and sign-off\nprocesses that prevent the team from achieving daily progress. This\nincludes identifying and providing resources they need to do their job.\nAs mentioned in Law 20, frequent check-ins with all of my directors has\nallowed me to do this quickly and decisively. Team members tend to know\nexactly what’s getting in their way – but leaders rarely bother to ask them,\nand when they do, they rarely act quickly enough to resolve it. This causes\na decay in trust, and team members become increasingly reluctant to speak\nup about friction causing issues in the future.\n5. BR O AD CASTIN G THE PR O GR ESS\nLeaders need to point out, publicise and praise progress as loud, far and\nwide as they possibly can. Recognition reinforces behaviour, but it also acts\nas evidence to adjacent teams that progress is possible for them too.\nIn every company and team I run, the head of the team is asked to\nbroadcast a weekly update to the entire company detailing all the progress\n\f\ntheir team has made that week. This ritual has been incredibly powerful in\ncreating a collective sense that we’re ‘going somewhere’ as Sir David\nBrailsford would say, and when people feel like they’re going somewhere,\nthey’re more motivated, feel happier and are more engaged with leadership.\nTHE LAW : LEV ER AGE THE PO W ER  O F\nPR O GR ESS\nTo solve problems, encourage and celebrate small wins. This provides\ncontinuous forward momentum, which creates an atmosphere of success\nand a positive sense that a team is moving towards their bigger goals.\nEmployees are most motivated when they are engaged with the work that\nthey’re doing, and feel like they are making a difference.\n\f\nThe most professionally rewarding feeling\nin the world is a sense of forward motion."

The sky was overcast, and a light drizzle was falling as\nManchester United arrived at White Hart Lane stadium, then the home of\nTottenham Hotspurs.\nThe Red Devils had started the season on formidable form, sitting at the\ntop of the league, three points clear, and were today facing an on-form\nhome team who were determined to take down the league leaders.\nThe first half of the match was a tense and tight\naffair, with neither team able to gain a clear\nadvantage. Both teams battled fiercely for\npossession, with the midfield a blur of flying boots\nand sliding tackles. However, a fortuitous penalty\nawarded to Manchester United in the last minute of\nthe first half gave them a lucky 1–0 lead as they\nheaded into the dressing room at half-time."

    "raw_text": "As the team entered the dressing room, Ferguson walked in, sat down\nand said nothing for three minutes. The room was eerily quiet as the players\nsat nervously, avoiding eye contact with the silent manager. They knew that\nwhen Ferguson sat in silence, it wasn’t a good sign.\nEvra was playing what he would later describe as the ‘best game of his\nlife’. He had been a constant thorn in the side of the Tottenham defence,\nmaking surging runs up the left flank and delivering pinpoint crosses.\nPatrice was smiling, drinking water and being congratulated by his\nteammates as he caught the gaze of Ferguson, who was looking straight at\nhim. He recalls:\nI’m playing the best game of my life. I promise you, I was on fire. I\ncame back to the dressing room, I was relaxed, happy, drinking\nsome water. My teammates were congratulating me, saying ‘Wow,\nPatrice, you’re on fire!’ Then Ferguson walked in, sat down for\nthree minutes and locked his eyes on me. He asked me, ‘Patrice, are\nyou OK?’ I said, ‘Yes, I’m OK, boss.’ He then asked me ‘Are you\ntired?’\nSeriously, I looked around, thinking his question must be a\nprank. Maybe there was some hidden camera and he was winding\nme up. The players around me were equally confused.\n‘No, I’m fine’, I replied.\n‘Why did you pass the ball back to the keeper,’ he continued.\n‘Because I didn’t have any options in front of me, that was the\nonly option I had’, I explained.\n‘If you do that again, you will come and watch the rest of the\nfucking game sat next to me. This is the worst game you’ve played\nsince you’ve played for Manchester United.’ He shouted, ‘If you\npass it back again I promise you, you will never play for\nManchester United again’.\nI kept my mouth shut. I was biting my lips. But I never wanted\nto answer him back in front of my teammates. People were in shock.\nEveryone was thinking, What’s going on?\n\f\nManchester United came out of the dressing room for the second half with\nrenewed energy, a fire in their bellies and an increased focused. They\ndominated the second half, scoring three more goals and securing a 4–0\nvictory over the home team. It was a performance that would go down in\nthe history books as one of Manchester United’s greatest away victories.\nThe Independent called it a ‘divine demolition from a team at the height of\ntheir powers’.\nPatrice was still perplexed by the berating he’d received from Ferguson\nat half time:\nI took my shower, got my clothes on and I couldn’t wait to sleep\nand come back to the training ground the next day to speak to him\nabout what had happened. The next day I knocked on his office door\nand he invited me in.\n‘Ohhh Patrice, how are you my son? Come and sit down!’\nFerguson said.\nI replied: ‘Boss what happened yesterday? Why did you say that\nto me?’\n‘Patrice, you were the best player on the pitch. But you know,\nCristiano Ronaldo started doing too many skills, some of your\nteammates were wasting their chances on the ball, and when you\nplay for Manchester United, you need to score one goal, and then a\nsecond, and then a third. You can’t just score one goal. You were the\nbest player, my son, get out of my office!’\nHe was whistling and singing and laughing.\nHe knew I could take the fire; he shouted at me because he\nwanted to send a message to the other players, to Cristiano, to make\nsure they kept focused and respected Tottenham. So, he picked the\nbest player on the pitch, a player he knew could take it, so that every\nother player on our team thought, If he’s killing the best player on\nthe pitch, I better improve my game. That’s what I mean by\nmanaging, that’s Fergie.\n\f\nTo my surprise, every Manchester United player I’ve spoken to and\ninterviewed said Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t care about tactics, strategies and\nformations. He cared primarily about getting the best out of each individual,\nthe team’s culture and their attitude; he didn’t want them ever to become\ncomplacent.\nGary Neville, who spent his entire playing career at Ferguson’s\nManchester United, told me:\nHe knew how to tap into your heart, no matter who you were, he\nknew how to tap into you. He would talk about my grandparents\nwhen he wanted to motivate me. My grandad was injured in the war,\nhe still has shrapnel in his shoulder from the battle. So, Sir Alex\nwould say, ‘What about your grandparents, getting up every single\nday, putting their tie on, working hard, going off to war?’ When Sir\nAlex would say that to me, I would keep going. When he spoke to\nsomeone else, he would say something completely different. He\nwould tap into every individual, in a different way, to make sure\nthey would never give in.\nRio Ferdinand, who played as centre-back and captain for Manchester\nUnited for 12 years, told me that Ferguson’s greatest attribute was his\nability to know every individual and to be a different shape jigsaw piece to\nall of them:\nHe understood people. He wouldn’t treat two players the same.\nBlanket treatment isn’t the best way to treat a team. Everyone’s\ndifferent, everyone takes advice differently. Everyone takes\ncriticism differently. And that’s why the leader or manager needs to\nknow the individuals. This was one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s greatest\ntraits. He knew everything, about everyone. When my grandad was\nin hospital once, even though he’d only met him twice, he knew my\ngrandad’s favourite drink, and flowers turned up at my mum’s\n\f\nhouse. He knew that mattered to me. It’s little things like that, that\nmade me fight harder for him.\nThe following quotes from other past players of Ferguson sum up what\nmade him such an exceptional manager.\n‘He had diﬀerent ways of dealing with\ndiﬀerent players. He knew how to get the\nbest out of everyone.’\nPeter Schmeichel\n‘He was very hard on me, but he had to be.\nHe saw something in me that he di\u0000n’t see\nin other players, and he pushed me to be\nthe best I could be.’\nDavid Beckham\n‘He always knew when to give me a kick up\nthe backside and when to put an arm\naround me. He knew how to treat diﬀerent\nplayers diﬀerently.’\nRyan Giggs\n‘He treated me diﬀerently than the other\nplayers, but in a good way. He pushed me\n\f\nto be better, and I think that’s why I\nbecame the player I am today.’\nWayne Rooney\n‘He treated me diﬀerently from the other\nplayers. He would always talk to me and\ngive me advice. He helped me to become a\nbetter player.’\nCristiano Ronaldo\nTHE AR T O F BEIN G AN  IN CO N SISTEN T\nLEAD ER\nEvery book dedicated to leadership and management espouses the virtues of\nconsistency, predictability and fairness as hallmarks of great leaders.\nHowever, my decade-long study of truly exceptional managers has revealed\nthe opposite to be true. My own experience leading more than 1,000\nindividuals across four companies has taught me that my ability to adapt to\neach individual, to be inconsistent in my approach and to skilfully shift my\nemotions like a chameleon in order to elicit the best from every member of\nmy team, positively correlates with my ability to motivate.\nAs we have explored in previous laws in this book, humans are not the\nrational, logical and analytical creatures we presume ourselves to be. We\nare emotional, illogical and driven by a multitude of emotional impulses,\nfears, desires, insecurities, and childhood experiences. In light of this, a\none-size-fits-all, reason-, information- and facts-centric approach to\nleadership is deeply inadequate for inspiring passion, motivation and action\namong any group of people."

    "raw_text": "For us as leaders, to become the\ncomplementary puzzle piece for each\nmember of our team, we must be as\ninconsistent, emotionally variable and\nuctuating as the people in our teams\nare.\nRio Ferdinand recounts how Ferguson was a masterful actor, able to feign\nany emotion, from anger to elation, in order to evoke the emotions he\nbelieved would best serve the team’s success:\nHe was so calculated. We talked about it all the time amongst the\nplayers. The way he spoke – he would go on TV after a defeat and\nintentionally, furiously, hammer the referee to deflect attention away\nfrom the players. He did that to remove the focus from the team, to\nmake sure we weren’t feeling down about ourselves, so that we\nwould be motivated for the next game. He was so calculated. The\nbest man-manager.\nTHE LAW : YO U  M U ST BE AN  IN CO N SISTEN T\nLEAD ER\nIt is impossible to seamlessly blend into a team as a jigsaw piece unless you\ncomprehend the unique shape of each of your team members. Sir Alex\nFerguson’s acumen in this regard was legendary, as attested to by his former\nplayers and staff, and even rival managers. He possessed an encyclopedic\nknowledge of everything from the hobbies of his players’ wives to the\nnames of their pets, and as Rio Ferdinand told me, even their grandfathers’\npreferred brand of whisky. More significantly, he knew that every member\n\f\nof his team was propelled by vastly different motivators. While one player\nmay have thrived under Ferguson’s infamous ‘hairdryer’ treatment (where\nhe would shout angrily at them in the dressing room or on the training\nground), another may have required a more compassionate approach, and\nstill another may have been motivated by a more hands-off approach. This\nis why Ferguson didn’t have to be the tactical mastermind that many\nassume he must have been, but rather an emotional savant.
