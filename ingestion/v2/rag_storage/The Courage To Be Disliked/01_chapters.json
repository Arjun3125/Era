    "raw_text": "On the outskirts of the thousand-year-old city lived a philosopher who taught that the world\nwas simple and that happiness was within the reach of every man, instantly. A young man\nwho was dissatis\u0000ed with life went to visit this philosopher to get to the heart of the matter.\nThis youth found the world a chaotic mass of contradictions and, in his anxious eyes, any\nnotion of happiness was completely absurd.\n\f\nIntroduction\nYOUTH: I want to ask you once again; you do believe that the world is, in all ways, a simple\nplace?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, this world is astonishingly simple and life itself is, too.\nYOUTH: So, is this your idealistic argument or is it a workable theory? What I mean is, are you\nsaying that any issues you or I face in life are simple too?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course.\nYOUTH: Alright then, but let me explain why I have come to visit you today. Firstly, I want to\ndebate this with you until I am satis\u0000ed, and then, if possible, I want to get you to retract this\ntheory.\nPHILOSOPHER: Ha-ha.\nYOUTH: Because I have heard all about your reputation. The word is that there is an eccentric\nphilosopher living here whose teachings and arguments are hard to ignore, namely, that\npeople can change, that the world is simple and that everyone can be happy. That is the sort\nof thing I have heard, but I \u0000nd that view totally unacceptable, so I wanted to con\u0000rm things\nfor myself. If I \u0000nd anything you say completely o\u0000, I will point it out and then correct\nyou . . . But will you \u0000nd that annoying?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, I would welcome the opportunity. I have been hoping to hear from a\nyoung person just like you and to learn as much as possible from what you can tell me.\nYOUTH: Thanks. I do not intend to dismiss you out of hand. I will take your views into\nconsideration and then look at the possibilities that present themselves. ‘The world is simple\nand life is simple, too’—if there is anything in this thesis that might contain truth, it would\nbe life from a child’s point of view. Children do not have any obvious duties, like paying taxes\nor going to work. They are protected by their parents and society, and can spend days free\nfrom care. They can imagine a future that goes on forever and do whatever they want. They\ndon’t have to see grim reality—they are blindfolded. So, to them the world must have a\nsimple form. However, as a child matures to adulthood the world reveals its true nature. Very\n\f\nshortly, the child will know how things really are and what he is really allowed to do. His\nopinion will alter and all he will see is impossibility. His romantic view will end and be\nreplaced by cruel realism.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. That is an interesting view.\nYOUTH: That’s not all. Once grown up, the child will get entangled in all kinds of\ncomplicated relationships with people and have all kinds of responsibilities thrust upon him.\nThat is how life will be, both at work and at home, and in any role he assumes in public life. It\ngoes without saying that he will become aware of the various issues in society that he couldn’t\nunderstand as a child, including discrimination, war, and inequality, and he will not be able\nto ignore them. Am I wrong?\nPHILOSOPHER: It sounds \u0000ne to me. Please continue.\nYOUTH: Well, if we were still living at a time when religion held sway, salvation might be an\noption because the teachings of the divine were everything to us. All we had to do was obey\nthem and consequently have little to think about. But religion has lost its power and now\nthere is no real belief in God. With nothing to rely on, everyone is \u0000lled with anxiety and\ndoubt. Everyone is living for themselves. That is how society is today, so please tell me—given\nthese realities and in the light of what I have said—can you still say the world is simple?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no change in what I say. The world is simple and life is simple, too.\nYOUTH: How? Anyone can see that it’s a chaotic mass of contradictions.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is not because the world is complicated. It’s because you are making the\nworld complicated.\nYOUTH: I am?\nPHILOSOPHER: None of us live in an objective world, but instead in a subjective world that we\nourselves have given meaning to. The world you see is di\u0000erent from the one I see, and it’s\nimpossible to share your world with anyone else.\nYOUTH: How can that be? You and I are living in the same country, in the same time, and we\nare seeing the same things—aren’t we?\nPHILOSOPHER: You look rather young to me, but have you ever drunk well water that has just\nbeen drawn?\n\f\nYOUTH: Well water? Um, it was a long time ago, but there was a well at my grandmother’s\nhouse in the countryside. I remember enjoying the fresh, cold water drawn from that well on\na hot summer’s day.\nPHILOSOPHER: You may know this, but well water stays at pretty much the same temperature\nall year round, at about sixty degrees. That is an objective number—it stays the same to\neveryone who measures it. But when you drink the water in the summer it seems cool and\nwhen you drink the same water in the winter it seems warm. Even though it’s the same water,\nat the same sixty degrees according to the thermometer, the way it seems depends on whether\nit’s summer or winter.\nYOUTH: So, it’s an illusion caused by the change in the environment.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, it’s not an illusion. You see, to you, in that moment, the coolness or\nwarmth of the well water is an undeniable fact. That’s what it means to live in your subjective\nworld. There is no escape from your own subjectivity. At present, the world seems\ncomplicated and mysterious to you, but if you change, the world will appear more simple.\nThe issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are.\nYOUTH: How I am?\nPHILOSOPHER: Right  .  .  . It’s as if you see the world through dark glasses, so naturally\neverything seems dark. But if that is the case, instead of lamenting about the world’s darkness,\nyou could just remove the glasses. Perhaps the world will appear terribly bright to you then\nand you will involuntarily shut your eyes. Maybe you’ll want the glasses back on, but can you\neven take them o\u0000 in the \u0000rst place? Can you look directly at the world? Do you have the\ncourage?\nYOUTH: Courage?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it’s a matter of courage.\nYOUTH: Well, alright. There are tons of objections I would like to raise, but I get the feeling it\nwould be better to go into them later. I would like to con\u0000rm that you are saying ‘people can\nchange’, right?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course people can change. They can also \u0000nd happiness.\nYOUTH: Everyone, without exception?\nPHILOSOPHER: No exceptions whatsoever.\n\f\nYOUTH: Ha-ha! Now you’re talking big! This is getting interesting. I’m going to start arguing\nwith you immediately.\nPHILOSOPHER: I am not going to run away or hide anything. Let’s take our time debating\nthis. So, your position is ‘people cannot change?’\nYOUTH: That’s right, they can’t change. Actually, I am su\u0000ering myself because of not being\nable to change.\nPHILOSOPHER: And at the same time, you wish you could.\nYOUTH: Of course. If I could change, if I could start life all over again, I would gladly fall to\nmy knees before you. But it could turn out that you’ll be down on your knees before me.\nPHILOSOPHER: You remind me of myself during my own student days, when I was a hot-\nblooded young man searching for the truth, traipsing about, calling on philosophers . . .\nYOUTH: Yes. I am searching for the truth. The truth about life.\nPHILOSOPHER: I have never felt the need to take in disciples and have never done so. However,\nsince becoming a student of Greek philosophy and then coming into contact with another\nphilosophy, I have been waiting for a long time for a visit from a young person like you.\nYOUTH: Another philosophy? What would that be?\nPHILOSOPHER: My study is just over there. Go into it. It’s going to be a long night. I will go\nand make some hot co\u0000ee.\n\f\n\n\f\nTHE FIRST NIGHT:\nDeny Trauma"

    "raw_text": "The young man entered the study and sat slouched in a chair. Why was he so determined to\nreject the philosopher’s theories? His reasons were abundantly clear. He lacked self-\ncon\u0000dence and, ever since childhood, this had been compounded by deep-seated feelings of\ninferiority with regard to his personal and academic backgrounds, as well as his physical\nappearance. Perhaps, as a result, he tended to be excessively self-conscious when people\nlooked at him. Mostly, he seemed incapable of truly appreciating other people’s happiness\nand was constantly pitying himself. To him, the philosopher’s claims were nothing more than\nthe stu\u0000 of fantasy."

    "raw_text": "The Unknown Third Giant\nYOUTH: A moment ago, you used the words “another philosophy,” but I’ve heard that your\nspecialty is in Greek philosophy.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, Greek philosophy has been central to my life ever since I was a teenager.\nThe great intellectual \u0000gures: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. I am translating a work by Plato at\nthe moment, and I expect to spend the rest of my life studying classical Greek thought.\nYOUTH: Well, then what is this “other philosophy”?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is a completely new school of psychology that was established by the\nAustrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is generally\nreferred to as Adlerian psychology.\nYOUTH: Huh. I never would have imagined that a specialist in Greek philosophy would be\ninterested in psychology.\nPHILOSOPHER: I’m not very familiar with paths taken by other schools of psychology.\nHowever, I think it is fair to say that Adlerian psychology is clearly in line with Greek\nphilosophy, and that it is a proper \u0000eld of study.\nYOUTH: I have a passing knowledge of the psychology of Freud and Jung. A fascinating \u0000eld.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, Freud and Jung are both renowned. Adler was one of the original core\nmembers of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, which was led by Freud. His ideas were\ncounter to Freud’s, and he split from the group and proposed an “individual psychology”\nbased on his own original theories.\nYOUTH: Individual psychology? Another odd term. So Adler was a disciple of Freud’s?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, he was not. That misconception is common; we must dispel it. For one\nthing, Adler and Freud were relatively close in age, and the relationship they formed as\nresearchers was founded upon equal footing. In this respect, Adler was very di\u0000erent from\nJung, who revered Freud as a father \u0000gure. Though psychology primarily tends to be"

    "raw_text": "associated with Freud and Jung, Adler is recognized throughout the rest of the world, along\nwith Freud and Jung, as one of the three giants in this \u0000eld.\nYOUTH: I see. I should have studied it more.\nPHILOSOPHER: I suppose it’s only natural you haven’t heard of Adler. As he himself said,\n“There might come a time when one will not remember my name; one might even have\nforgotten that our school ever existed.” Then he went on to say that it didn’t matter. The\nimplication being that if his school were forgotten, it would be because his ideas had\noutgrown the bounds of a single area of scholarship, and become commonplace, and a feeling\nshared by everyone. For example, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the international bestsellers How\nto Win Friends and Inﬂuence People and How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, referred to\nAdler as “a great psychologist who devoted his life to researching humans and their latent\nabilities.” The in\u0000uence of Adler’s thinking is clearly present throughout his writings. And in\nStephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Eﬀective People, much of the content closely\nresembles Adler’s ideas. In other words, rather than being a strict area of scholarship,\nAdlerian psychology is accepted as a realization, a culmination of truths and of human\nunderstanding. Yet Adler’s ideas are said to have been a hundred years ahead of their time,\nand even today we have not managed to fully comprehend them. That is how truly\ngroundbreaking they were.\nYOUTH: So your theories are developed not from Greek philosophy initially but from the\nviewpoint of Adlerian psychology?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, that’s right.\nYOUTH: Okay. There’s one more thing I’d like to ask about your basic stance. Are you a\nphilosopher? Or are you a psychologist?\nPHILOSOPHER: I am a philosopher, a person who lives philosophy. And, for me, Adlerian\npsychology is a form of thought that is in line with Greek philosophy, and that is philosophy.\nYOUTH: All right, then. Let’s get started.\n\f\nWhy People Can Change\nYOUTH: First, let’s plan the points of discussion. You say people can change. Then you take it\na step further, saying that everyone can \u0000nd happiness.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, everyone, without exception.\nYOUTH: Let’s save the discussion about happiness for later and address change \u0000rst. Everyone\nwishes they could change. I know I do, and I’m sure anyone you might stop and ask on the\nstreet would agree. But why does everyone feel they want to change? There’s only one answer:\nbecause they cannot change. If it were easy for people to change, they wouldn’t spend so\nmuch time wishing they could. No matter how much they wish it, people cannot change.\nAnd that’s why there are always so many people getting taken in by new religions and\ndubious self-help seminars and any preaching on how everyone can change. Am I wrong?\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, in response, I’d ask why you are so adamant that people can’t change.\nYOUTH: Here’s why. I have a friend, a guy, who has shut himself in his room for several years.\nHe wishes he could go out and even thinks he’d like to have a job, if possible. So he wants to\nchange the way he is. I say this as his friend, but I assure you he is a very serious person who\ncould be of great use to society. Except that he’s afraid to leave his room. If he takes even a\nsingle step outside, he su\u0000ers palpitations, and his arms and legs shake. It’s a kind of neurosis\nor panic, I suppose. He wants to change, but he can’t.\nPHILOSOPHER: What do you think the reason is that he can’t go out?\nYOUTH: I’m not really sure. It could be because of his relationship with his parents, or\nbecause he was bullied at school or work. He might have experienced a kind of trauma from\nsomething like that. But then, it could be the opposite—maybe he was too pampered as a\nchild and can’t face reality. I just don’t know, and I can’t pry into his past or his family\nsituation.\nPHILOSOPHER: So you are saying there were incidents in your friend’s past that became the\ncause of trauma, or something similar, and as a result he can’t go out anymore?\nYOUTH: Of course. Before an e\u0000ect, there’s a cause. There is nothing mysterious about that.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Then perhaps the cause of his not being able to go out anymore lies in the\nhome environment during his childhood. He was abused by his parents and reached\nadulthood without ever feeling love. That’s why he’s afraid of interacting with people and\nwhy he can’t go out. It’s feasible, isn’t it?\nYOUTH: Yes, it’s entirely feasible. I’d imagine that would be really challenging.\nPHILOSOPHER: And then you say, “Before an e\u0000ect, there’s a cause.” Or, in other words, who\nI am now (the e\u0000ect) is determined by occurrences in the past (the causes). Do I understand\ncorrectly?\nYOUTH: You do.\nPHILOSOPHER: So if the here and now of everyone in the world is due to their past incidents,\naccording to you, wouldn’t things turn out very strangely? Don’t you see? Everyone who has\ngrown up abused by his or her parents would have to su\u0000er the same e\u0000ects as your friend\nand become a recluse, or the whole idea just doesn’t hold water. That is, if the past actually\ndetermines the present, and the causes control the e\u0000ects.\nYOUTH: What, exactly, are you getting at?\nPHILOSOPHER: If we focus only on past causes and try to explain things solely through cause\nand e\u0000ect, we end up with “determinism.” Because what this says is that our present and our\nfuture have already been decided by past occurrences, and are unalterable. Am I wrong?\nYOUTH: So you’re saying that the past doesn’t matter?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, that is the standpoint of Adlerian psychology.\nYOUTH: I see. The points of con\u0000ict seem a bit clearer. But look, if we go by your version,\nwouldn’t that ultimately mean that there’s no reason my friend can’t go out anymore?\nBecause you’re saying that past incidents don’t matter. I’m sorry, but that’s completely out of\nthe question. There has to be some reason behind his seclusion. There has to be, or there’d be\nno explanation!\nPHILOSOPHER: Indeed, there would be no explanation. So in Adlerian psychology, we do not\nthink about past “causes” but rather about present “goals.”\nYOUTH: Present goals?\nPHILOSOPHER: Your friend is insecure, so he can’t go out. Think about it the other way\naround. He doesn’t want to go out, so he’s creating a state of anxiety.\n\f\nYOUTH: Huh?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think about it this way. Your friend had the goal of not going out\nbeforehand, and he’s been manufacturing a state of anxiety and fear as a means to achieve\nthat goal. In Adlerian psychology, this is called “teleology.”\nYOUTH: You’re joking! My friend has imagined his anxiety and fear? So would you go so far as\nsaying that my friend is just pretending to be sick?\nPHILOSOPHER: He is not pretending to be sick. The anxiety and fear your friend is feeling are\nreal. On occasion, he might also su\u0000er from migraines and violent stomach cramps. However,\nthese too are symptoms that he has created in order to achieve the goal of not going out.\nYOUTH: That’s not true! No way! That’s too depressing!\nPHILOSOPHER: No. This is the di\u0000erence between etiology (the study of causation) and\nteleology (the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause). Everything\nyou have been telling me is based in etiology. As long as we stay in etiology, we will not take a\nsingle step forward."

    "raw_text": "Trauma Does Not Exist\nYOUTH: If you are going to state things so forcibly, I’d like a thorough explanation. To begin\nwith, what is the di\u0000erence you refer to between etiology and teleology?\nPHILOSOPHER: Suppose you’ve got a cold with a high fever, and you go to see the doctor.\nThen, suppose the doctor says the reason for your sickness is that yesterday, when you went\nout, you weren’t dressed properly, and that’s why you caught a cold. Now, would you be\nsatis\u0000ed with that?\nYOUTH: Of course I wouldn’t. It wouldn’t matter to me what the reason was—the way I was\ndressed or because it was raining or whatever. It’s the symptoms, the fact that I’m su\u0000ering\nwith a high fever now that would matter to me. If he’s a doctor, I’d need him to treat me by\nprescribing medicine, giving shots, or taking whatever specialized measures are necessary.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yet those who take an etiological stance, including most counselors and\npsychiatrists, would argue that what you were su\u0000ering from stemmed from such-and-such\ncause in the past, and would then end up just consoling you by saying, “So you see, it’s not\nyour fault.” The argument concerning so-called traumas is typical of etiology.\nYOUTH: Wait a minute! Are you denying the existence of trauma altogether?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, I am. Adamantly.\nYOUTH: What! Aren’t you, or I guess I should say Adler, an authority on psychology?\nPHILOSOPHER: In Adlerian psychology, trauma is de\u0000nitively denied. This was a very new and\nrevolutionary point. Certainly, the Freudian view of trauma is fascinating. Freud’s idea is that\na person’s psychic wounds (traumas) cause his or her present unhappiness. When you treat a\nperson’s life as a vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality and sense of\ndramatic development that creates strong impressions and is extremely attractive. But Adler,\nin denial of the trauma argument, states the following: “No experience is in itself a cause of\nour success or failure. We do not su\u0000er from the shock of our experiences—the so-called\ntrauma—but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not\ndetermined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.”\n\f\nYOUTH: So we make of them whatever suits our purposes?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Focus on the point Adler is making here when he refers to the self\nbeing determined not by our experiences themselves, but by the meaning we give them. He is\nnot saying that the experience of a horrible calamity or abuse during childhood or other such\nincidents have no in\u0000uence on forming a personality; their in\u0000uences are strong. But the\nimportant thing is that nothing is actually determined by those in\u0000uences. We determine our\nown lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences. Your life is not\nsomething that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself, and you are the one\nwho decides how you live.\nYOUTH: Okay, so you’re saying that my friend has shut himself in his room because he\nactually chooses to live this way? This is serious. Believe me, it is not what he wants. If\nanything, it’s something he was forced to choose because of circumstances. He had no choice\nother than to become who he is now.\nPHILOSOPHER: No. Even supposing that your friend actually thinks, I can’t ﬁt into society\nbecause I was abused by my parents, it’s still because it is his goal to think that way.\nYOUTH: What sort of goal is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: The immediate thing would probably be the goal of “not going out.” He is\ncreating anxiety and fear as his reasons to stay inside.\nYOUTH: But why doesn’t he want to go out? That’s where the problem resides.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, think of it from the parents’ view. How would you feel if your child\nwere shut up in a room?\nYOUTH: I’d be worried, of course. I’d want to help him return to society, I’d want him to be\nwell, and I’d wonder if I’d raised him improperly. I’m sure I would be seriously concerned and\ntry in every way imaginable to help him back to a normal existence.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is where the problem is.\nYOUTH: Where?\nPHILOSOPHER: If I stay in my room all the time, without ever going out, my parents will\nworry. I can get all of my parents’ attention focused on me. They’ll be extremely careful\naround me and always handle me with kid gloves. On the other hand, if I take even one step\nout of the house, I’ll just become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. I’ll\nbe surrounded by people I don’t know and just end up average, or less than average. And no\n\f\none will take special care of me any longer . . . Such stories about reclusive people are not\nuncommon.\nYOUTH: In that case, following your line of reasoning, my friend has accomplished his goal\nand is satis\u0000ed with his current situation?\nPHILOSOPHER: I doubt he’s satis\u0000ed, and I’m sure he’s not happy either. But there is no\ndoubt that he is also taking action in line with his goal. This is not something that is unique\nto your friend. Every one of us is living in line with some goal. That is what teleology tells us.\nYOUTH: No way. I reject that as completely unacceptable. Look, my friend is—\nPHILOSOPHER: Listen, this discussion won’t go anywhere if we just keep talking about your\nfriend. It will turn into a trial in absentia, and that would be hopeless. Let’s use another\nexample.\nYOUTH: Well, how about this one? It’s my own story about something I experienced\nyesterday.\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh? I’m all ears.\n\f\nPeople Fabricate Anger\nYOUTH: Yesterday afternoon, I was reading a book in a co\u0000ee shop when a waiter passed by\nand spilled co\u0000ee on my jacket. I’d just bought it and it’s my nicest piece of clothing. I\ncouldn’t help it, I just blew my top. I yelled at him at the top of my lungs. I’m not normally\nthe type of person who speaks loudly in public places. But yesterday, the shop was ringing\nwith the sound of my shouting because I \u0000ew into a rage and forgot what I was doing. So\nhow about that? Is there any room for a goal to be involved here? No matter how you look at\nit, isn’t this behavior that originates from a cause?\nPHILOSOPHER: So you were stimulated by the emotion of anger and ended up shouting.\nThough you are normally mild-mannered, you couldn’t resist being angry. It was an\nunavoidable occurrence, and you couldn’t do anything about it. Is that what you are saying?\nYOUTH: Yes, because it happened so suddenly. The words just came out of my mouth before I\nhad time to think.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then suppose you happened to have had a knife on you yesterday, and when\nyou blew up you got carried away and stabbed him. Would you still be able to justify that by\nsaying, “It was an unavoidable occurrence, and I couldn’t do anything about it”?\nYOUTH: That . . . Come on, that’s an extreme argument!\nPHILOSOPHER: It is not an extreme argument. If we proceed with your reasoning, any o\u0000ense\ncommitted in anger can be blamed on anger and will no longer be the responsibility of the\nperson because, essentially, you are saying that people cannot control their emotions.\nYOUTH: Well, how do you explain my anger, then?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s easy. You did not \u0000y into a rage and then start shouting. It is solely that\nyou got angry so that you could shout. In other words, in order to ful\u0000ll the goal of shouting,\nyou created the emotion of anger.\nYOUTH: What do you mean?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: The goal of shouting came before anything else. That is to say, by shouting,\nyou wanted to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you had to say. As a means\nto do that, you fabricated the emotion of anger.\nYOUTH: I fabricated it? You’ve got to be joking!\nPHILOSOPHER: Then why did you raise your voice?\nYOUTH: As I said before, I blew my top. I was deeply frustrated.\nPHILOSOPHER: No. You could have explained matters without raising your voice, and the\nwaiter would most likely have given you a sincere apology, wiped your jacket with a clean\ncloth, and taken other appropriate measures. He might have even arranged for it to be dry-\ncleaned. And somewhere in your mind, you were anticipating that he might do these things\nbut, even so, you shouted. The procedure of explaining things in normal words felt like too\nmuch trouble, and you tried to get out of that and make this unresisting person submit to\nyou. The tool you used to do this was the emotion of anger.\nYOUTH: No way. You can’t fool me. I manufactured anger in order to make him submit to\nme? I swear to you, there wasn’t even a second to think of such a thing. I didn’t think it over\nand then get angry. Anger is a more impulsive emotion.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right, anger is an instantaneous emotion. Now listen, I have a story.\nOne day, a mother and daughter were quarreling loudly. Then, suddenly, the telephone rang.\n“Hello?” The mother picked up the receiver hurriedly, her voice still thick with anger. The\ncaller was her daughter’s homeroom teacher. As soon as the mother realized who was\nphoning, the tone of her voice changed and she became very polite. Then, for the next \u0000ve\nminutes or so, she carried on a conversation in her best telephone voice. Once she hung up, in\na moment, her expression changed again and she went straight back to yelling at her\ndaughter.\nYOUTH: Well, that’s not a particularly unusual story.\nPHILOSOPHER: Don’t you see? In a word, anger is a tool that can be taken out as needed. It\ncan be put away the moment the phone rings, and pulled out again after one hangs up. The\nmother isn’t yelling in anger she cannot control. She is simply using the anger to overpower\nher daughter with a loud voice and thereby assert her opinions.\nYOUTH: So anger is a means to achieve a goal?\nPHILOSOPHER: That is what teleology says.\n\f\nYOUTH: Ah, I see now. Under that gentle-looking mask you wear, you’re terribly nihilistic!\nWhether we’re talking about anger or my reclusive friend, all your insights are stu\u0000ed with\nfeelings of distrust for human beings!"

    "raw_text": "How to Live Without Being Controlled by the\nPast\nPHILOSOPHER: How am I being nihilistic?\nYOUTH: Think about it. Simply put, you deny human emotion. You say that emotions are\nnothing more than tools, that they’re just the means for achieving goals. But listen. If you\ndeny emotion, you’re upholding a view that tries to deny our humanity, too. Because it’s our\nemotions, and the fact that we are swayed by all sorts of feelings, that make us human. If\nemotions are denied, humans will be nothing more than poor excuses for machines. If that\nisn’t nihilism, then what is?\nPHILOSOPHER: I am not denying that emotion exists. Everyone has emotions. That goes\nwithout saying. But if you are going to tell me that people are beings who can’t resist\nemotion, I’d argue against that. Adlerian psychology is a form of thought, a philosophy that is\ndiametrically opposed to nihilism. We are not controlled by emotion. In this sense, while it\nshows that people are not controlled by emotion, additionally it shows that we are not\ncontrolled by the past.\nYOUTH: So people are not controlled either by emotion or the past?\nPHILOSOPHER: Okay, for example, suppose there is someone whose parents had divorced in\nhis past. Isn’t this something objective, the same as the well water that is always sixty degrees?\nBut then, does that divorce feel cold or does it feel warm? So this is a “now” thing, a\nsubjective thing. Regardless of what may have happened in the past, it is the meaning that is\nattributed to it that determines the way someone’s present will be.\nYOUTH: The question isn’t “What happened?” but “How was it resolved?”\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. We can’t go back to the past in a time machine. We can’t turn back\nthe hands of time. If you end up staying in etiology, you will be bound by the past and never\nbe able to \u0000nd happiness.\nYOUTH: That’s right! We can’t change the past, and that’s precisely why life is so hard.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Life isn’t just hard. If the past determined everything and couldn’t be\nchanged, we who are living today would no longer be able to take e\u0000ective steps forward in\nour lives. What would happen as a result? We would end up with the kind of nihilism and\npessimism that loses hope in the world and gives up on life. The Freudian etiology that is\ntypi\u0000ed by the trauma argument is determinism in a di\u0000erent form, and it is the road to\nnihilism. Are you going to accept values like that?\nYOUTH: I don’t want to accept them, but the past is so powerful.\nPHILOSOPHER: Think of the possibilities. If one assumes that people are beings who can\nchange, a set of values based on etiology becomes untenable, and one is compelled to take the\nposition of teleology as a matter of course.\nYOUTH: So you are saying that one should always take the “people can change” premise?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. And please understand, it is Freudian etiology that denies our free\nwill and treats humans like machines.\nThe young man paused and glanced around the philosopher’s study. Floor-to-ceiling\nbookshelves \u0000lled the walls, and on a small wooden desk lay a fountain pen and what\nappeared to be a partially written manuscript. “People are not driven by past causes\nbut move toward goals that they themselves set”—that was the philosopher’s claim.\nThe teleology he espoused was an idea that overturned at the root the causality of\nrespectable psychology, and the young man found that impossible to accept. So from\nwhich standpoint should he start to argue it? The youth took a deep breath."

    "raw_text": "Socrates and Adler\nYOUTH: All right. Let me tell you about another friend of mine, a man named Y. He’s the\nkind of person who has always had a bright personality and talks easily to anyone. He’s like a\nsun\u0000ower—everyone loves him, and people smile whenever he’s around. In contrast, I am\nsomeone who has never had an easy time socially and who’s kind of warped in various ways.\nNow, you are claiming that people can change through Adler’s teleology?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. You and I and everyone can change.\nYOUTH: Then, do you think I could become someone like Y? From the bottom of my heart, I\nreally wish I could be like him.\nPHILOSOPHER: At this point, I’d have to say that’s totally out of the question.\nYOUTH: Aha! Now you’re showing your true colors! So are you going to retract your theory?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, I am not. Unfortunately, you have almost no understanding of Adlerian\npsychology yet. The \u0000rst step to change is knowing.\nYOUTH: So if I can understand just something about Adlerian psychology, can I become a\nperson like Y?\nPHILOSOPHER: Why are you rushing for answers? You should arrive at answers on your own,\nnot rely upon what you get from someone else. Answers from others are nothing more than\nstopgap measures; they’re of no value. Take Socrates, who left not one book actually written\nby himself. He spent his days having public debates with the citizens of Athens, especially the\nyoung, and it was his disciple, Plato, who put his philosophy into writing for future\ngenerations. Adler, too, showed little interest in literary activities, preferring to engage in\npersonal dialogue at cafés in Vienna, and hold small discussion groups. He was de\u0000nitely not\nan armchair intellectual.\nYOUTH: So Socrates and Adler both conveyed their ideas by dialogue?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. All your doubts will be dispelled through this dialogue. And you\nwill begin to change. Not by my words, but by your own doing. I do not want to take away\n\f\nthat valuable process of arriving at answers through dialogue.\nYOUTH: So are we going to try and reenact the kind of dialogue that Socrates and Adler\ncarried out? In this little study?\nPHILOSOPHER: Isn’t that good enough for you?\nYOUTH: That’s what I’m hoping to \u0000nd out! So let’s take it as far as we can, until either you\nretract your theory or I bow before you."

    "raw_text": "Are You Okay Just As You Are?\nPHILOSOPHER: Okay, let’s go back to your query. So you’d like to be a more upbeat person,\nlike Y?\nYOUTH: But you just rejected that and said it was out of the question. Well, I guess that’s just\nhow it is. I was just saying that to give you a hard time—I know myself well enough. I could\nnever be someone like that.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why not?\nYOUTH: It’s obvious. Because we have di\u0000erent personalities, or I guess you could say\ndispositions.\nPHILOSOPHER: Hmm.\nYOUTH: You, for instance, live surrounded by all these books. You read a new book and gain\nnew knowledge. Basically, you keep accumulating knowledge. The more you read, the more\nyour knowledge increases. You \u0000nd new concepts of value, and it seems to you that they\nchange you. Look, I hate to break it to you, but no matter how much knowledge you gain,\nyour disposition or personality isn’t going to basically change. If your base gets skewed, all\nyou’ve learned will be useless. Yes, all the knowledge you’ve acquired will come crashing\ndown around you, and then the next thing you know, you’ll be back to where you started!\nAnd the same goes for Adler’s ideas. No matter how many facts I may try to accumulate\nabout him, they’re not going to have any e\u0000ect on my personality. Knowledge just gets piled\nup as knowledge, until sooner or later it’s discarded.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then let me ask you this. Why do you think you want to be like Y? I guess you\njust want to be a di\u0000erent person, whether it’s Y or someone else. But what is the goal of that?\nYOUTH: You’re talking about goals again? As I said earlier, it’s just that I admire him and I\nthink I’d be happier if I were like him.\nPHILOSOPHER: You think you’d be happier if you were like him. Which means that you are\nnot happy now, right?\n\f\nYOUTH: What?\nPHILOSOPHER: Right now, you are unable to feel really happy. This is because you have not\nlearned to love yourself. And to try to love yourself, you are wishing to be reborn as a\ndi\u0000erent person. You’re hoping to become like Y and throw away who you are now. Correct?\nYOUTH: Yes, I guess that’s right! Let’s face it: I hate myself! I, the one who’s doing this playing\naround with old-fashioned philosophical discourse, and who just can’t help doing this sort of\nthing—yes, I really hate myself.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s all right. If you were to ask around for people who say they like\nthemselves, you’d be hard-pressed to \u0000nd someone who’d pu\u0000 up his or her chest with pride\nand say, “Yes, I like myself.”\nYOUTH: How about you? Do you like yourself?\nPHILOSOPHER: At the very least, I do not think I would like to be a di\u0000erent person and I\naccept who I am.\nYOUTH: You accept who you are?\nPHILOSOPHER: Look, no matter how much you want to be Y, you cannot be reborn as him.\nYou are not Y. It’s okay for you to be you. However, I am not saying it’s \u0000ne to be “just as you\nare.” If you are unable to really feel happy, then it’s clear that things aren’t right just as they\nare. You’ve got to put one foot in front of the other, and not stop.\nYOUTH: That’s a harsh way of putting it, but I get your point. It’s clear that I’m not right just\nthe way I am. I’ve got to move forward.\nPHILOSOPHER: To quote Adler again: “The important thing is not what one is born with but\nwhat use one makes of that equipment.” You want to be Y or someone else because you are\nutterly focused on what you were born with. Instead, you’ve got to focus on what you can\nmake of your equipment."

    "raw_text": "Unhappiness Is Something You Choose for\nYourself\nYOUTH: No way. That’s unreasonable.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why is it unreasonable?\nYOUTH: Why? Some people are born into a\u0000uent circumstances with parents who are nice,\nand others are born poor with bad parents. Because that’s how the world is. And I don’t\nreally want to get into this sort of subject, but things aren’t equal in the world and di\u0000erences\nbetween race, nationality, and ethnicity remain as deep as ever. It’s only natural to focus on\nwhat you were born with. All your talk is just academic theory—you’re ignoring the real\nworld!\nPHILOSOPHER: It is you who is ignoring reality. Does \u0000xating on what you are born with\nchange the reality? We are not replaceable machines. It is not replacement we need but\nrenewal.\nYOUTH: To me, replacement and renewal are one and the same. You’re avoiding the main\npoint. Look, there is such a thing as unhappiness from birth. Please acknowledge that, \u0000rst of\nall.\nPHILOSOPHER: I will not acknowledge that.\nYOUTH: Why?\nPHILOSOPHER: For one thing, right now you are unable to feel real happiness. You \u0000nd living\nhard, and even wish you could be reborn as a di\u0000erent person. But you are unhappy now\nbecause you yourself chose being unhappy. Not because you were born under an unlucky\nstar.\nYOUTH: I chose to be unhappy? How can I possibly accept that?\nPHILOSOPHER: There’s nothing extraordinary about it. It’s been repeated ever since the\nclassical Greek era. Have you heard the saying “No one desires evil”? It’s a proposition\n\f\ngenerally known as a Socratic paradox.\nYOUTH: There’s no shortage of people who desire evil, is there? Of course, there are plenty of\nthieves and murderers, and don’t forget all the politicians and o\u0000cials with their shady deals.\nIt’s probably harder to \u0000nd a truly good, upright person who does not desire evil.\nPHILOSOPHER: Without question, there is no shortage of behavior that is evil. But no one,\nnot even the most hardened criminal, becomes involved in crime purely out of a desire to\nengage in evil acts. Every criminal has an internal justi\u0000cation for getting involved in crime. A\ndispute over money leads someone to engage in murder, for instance. To the perpetrator, it is\nsomething for which there is a justi\u0000cation and which can be restated as an accomplishment\nof “good.” Of course, this is not good in a moral sense, but good in the sense of being “of\nbene\u0000t to oneself.”\nYOUTH: Of bene\u0000t to oneself?\nPHILOSOPHER: The Greek word for “good” (agathon) does not have a moral meaning. It just\nmeans “bene\u0000cial.” Conversely, the word for “evil” (kakon) means “not bene\u0000cial.” Our\nworld is rife with injustices and misdeeds of all kinds, yet there is not one person who desires\nevil in the purest sense of the word, that is to say something “not bene\u0000cial.”\nYOUTH: What does this have to do with me?\nPHILOSOPHER: At some stage in your life, you chose “being unhappy.” It is not because you\nwere born into unhappy circumstances or ended up in an unhappy situation. It’s that you\njudged “being unhappy” to be good for you.\nYOUTH: Why? What for?\nPHILOSOPHER: How do you justify this? Why did you choose to be unhappy? I have no way\nof knowing the speci\u0000c answer or details. Perhaps it will become clearer as we debate this.\nYOUTH: You are really trying to make a fool of me. You think this passes for philosophy? I do\nnot accept this at all.\nIn spite of himself, the young man got up and glared at the philosopher. I chose an\nunhappy life? Because it was good for me? What an absurd argument! Why is he going\nto such lengths to ridicule me? What did I do wrong? I’ll dismantle his argument, no\nmatter what it takes. I’ll make him kneel before me. The young man’s face \u0000ushed\nwith excitement.\n\f\nPeople Always Choose Not to Change\nPHILOSOPHER: Sit down. As things stand, it’s only natural that our views clash. I will now\ngive a simple explanation as to the manner in which humans are understood in Adlerian\npsychology.\nYOUTH: Okay, but please be brief.\nPHILOSOPHER: Earlier you said that any person’s disposition or personality cannot be\nchanged. In Adlerian psychology, we describe personality and disposition with the word\n“lifestyle.”\nYOUTH: Lifestyle?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life.\nYOUTH: Tendencies of thought and action?\nPHILOSOPHER: How one sees the world. And how one sees oneself. Think of lifestyle as a\nconcept bringing together these ways of \u0000nding meaning. In a narrow sense, lifestyle could be\nde\u0000ned as someone’s personality; taken more broadly, it is a word that encompasses the\nworldview of that person and his or her outlook on life.\nYOUTH: A person’s view of the world?\nPHILOSOPHER: Say there’s someone who worries about himself and says, “I am a pessimist.”\nOne could rephrase that to instead say, “I have a pessimistic view of the world.” You could\nconsider that the issue is not personality but rather the view of the world. It seems that the\nword “personality” is nuanced and suggests being unchangeable. But if we’re talking about a\nview of the world, well, then, that should be possible to alter.\nYOUTH: Hmm. This is kind of confusing. When you speak of a lifestyle, do you mean a way\nof living?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, you could put it that way. To be a little more accurate, it is the way one’s\nlife should be. You probably think of disposition or personality as something with which you\n\f\nare endowed, without any connection to your will. In Adlerian psychology, however, lifestyle\nis thought of as something that you choose for yourself.\nYOUTH: That you choose for yourself?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, exactly. You choose your lifestyle.\nYOUTH: So not only did I choose to be unhappy, but I even went so far as to choose this\nwarped personality, too?\nPHILOSOPHER: Absolutely.\nYOUTH: Ha! Now you’re really pushing it. When I became aware, I already had this\npersonality. I certainly don’t have any recollection of having chosen it. But it’s the same for\nyou, isn’t it? Being able to choose one’s own personality at will . . . Now that sounds like\nyou’re talking about robots, not people.\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, you did not consciously choose “this kind of self.” Your \u0000rst choice\nwas probably unconscious, combined with external factors you have referred to—that is, race,\nnationality, culture, and home environment. These certainly had a signi\u0000cant in\u0000uence on\nthat choice. Nevertheless, it is you who chose “this kind of self.”\nYOUTH: I don’t get what you’re saying. How on earth could I have chosen it?\nPHILOSOPHER: Adlerian psychology’s view is that it happens around the age of ten.\nYOUTH: Well, for argument’s sake—and now I’m really going out on a limb—say that when I\nwas ten, I unconsciously made this choice of lifestyle or whatever. Would that even matter?\nYou can call it personality or disposition or lifestyle, but, regardless, I had already become\n“this kind of self.” The state of things doesn’t change at all.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is not true. If your lifestyle is not something that you were naturally\nborn with, but something you chose yourself, then it must be possible to choose it over again.\nYOUTH: Now you’re saying I can choose it all over?\nPHILOSOPHER: Maybe you haven’t been aware of your lifestyle until now, and maybe you\nhaven’t been aware of the concept of lifestyle either. Of course, no one can choose his or her\nown birth. Being born in this country, in this era, and with these parents are things you did\nnot choose. And all these things have a great deal of in\u0000uence. You’ll probably face\ndisappointment and start looking at other people and feeling, I wish I’d been born in their\ncircumstances. But you can’t let it end there. The issue is not the past, but here, in the present.\n\f\nAnd now you’ve learned about lifestyle. But what you do with it from here on is your\nresponsibility. Whether you go on choosing the lifestyle you’ve had up till now, or you\nchoose a new lifestyle altogether, it’s entirely up to you.\nYOUTH: Then how do I choose again? You’re telling me, “You chose that lifestyle yourself, so\ngo ahead and select a new one instantly,” but there’s no way I can just change on the spot!\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, you can. People can change at any time, regardless of the environments\nthey are in. You are unable to change only because you are making the decision not to.\nYOUTH: What do you mean, exactly?\nPHILOSOPHER: People are constantly selecting their lifestyles. Right now, while we are having\nthis tête-à-tête, we are selecting ours. You describe yourself as an unhappy person. You say\nthat you want to change right this minute. You even claim that you want to be reborn as a\ndi\u0000erent person. After all that, then why are you still unable to change? It is because you are\nmaking the persistent decision not to change your lifestyle.\nYOUTH: No, don’t you see that’s completely illogical? I do want to change; that is my sincere\nwish. So how could I be making the decision not to?\nPHILOSOPHER: Although there are some small inconveniences and limitations, you probably\nthink that the lifestyle you have now is the most practical one, and that it’s easier to leave\nthings as they are. If you stay just like this, experience enables you to respond properly to\nevents as they occur, while guessing the results of one’s actions. You could say it’s like driving\nyour old, familiar car. It might rattle a bit, but one can take that into account and maneuver\neasily. On the other hand, if one chooses a new lifestyle, no one can predict what might\nhappen to the new self, or have any idea how to deal with events as they arise. It will be hard\nto see ahead to the future, and life will be \u0000lled with anxiety. A more painful and unhappy life\nmight lie ahead. Simply put, people have various complaints about things, but it’s easier and\nmore secure to be just the way one is.\nYOUTH: One wants to change, but changing is scary?\nPHILOSOPHER: When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our great courage to the test.\nThere is the anxiety generated by changing, and the disappointment attendant to not\nchanging. I am sure you have selected the latter.\nYOUTH: Wait . . . Just now, you used the word “courage.”\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage. Your unhappiness cannot\nbe blamed on your past or your environment. And it isn’t that you lack competence. You just\n\f\nlack courage. One might say you are lacking in the courage to be happy.\n\f\nYour Life Is Decided Here and Now\nYOUTH: The courage to be happy, huh?\nPHILOSOPHER: Do you need further explanation?\nYOUTH: No, hold on. This is getting confusing. First, you tell me that the world is a simple\nplace. That it seems complicated only because of me, and that my subjective view is making it\nthat way. And also, that life seems complicated just because I make it complicated, all of\nwhich is what makes it di\u0000cult for me to live happily. Then you say that one should take the\nstance of teleology, as opposed to Freudian etiology—that one must not search for causes in\none’s past, and should deny trauma. You say that people act to achieve some goal or other,\ninstead of being creatures who are driven by causes in their past. Right?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes.\nYOUTH: Furthermore, as the major premise of teleology, you say that people can change. That\npeople are always selecting their own lifestyles.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is correct.\nYOUTH: So I am unable to change because I myself keep repeatedly making the decision not\nto change. I don’t have enough courage to choose a new lifestyle. In other words, I do not\nhave enough courage to be happy, and that’s why I’m unhappy. Have I got anything wrong?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, you haven’t.\nYOUTH: Okay, in that case, my question is, What are the real measures I should take? What do\nI need to do to change my life? You haven’t explained all that yet.\nPHILOSOPHER: You are right. What you should do now is make a decision to stop your\ncurrent lifestyle. For instance, earlier you said, “If only I could be someone like Y, I’d be\nhappy.” As long as you live that way, in the realm of the possibility of “If only such and such\nwere the case,” you will never be able to change. Because saying “If only I could be like Y” is\nan excuse to yourself for not changing.\n\f\nYOUTH: An excuse not to change?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. I have a young friend who dreams of becoming a novelist, but he never\nseems to be able to complete his work. According to him, his job keeps him too busy, and he\ncan never \u0000nd enough time to write novels, and that’s why he can’t complete work and enter\nit for writing awards. But is that the real reason? No! It’s actually that he wants to leave the\npossibility of “I can do it if I try” open, by not committing to anything. He doesn’t want to\nexpose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’t want to face the reality that he might\nproduce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection. He wants to live inside that realm of\npossibilities, where he can say that he could do it if he only had the time, or that he could\nwrite if he just had the proper environment, and that he really does have the talent for it. In\nanother \u0000ve or ten years, he will probably start using other excuses like “I’m not young\nanymore” or “I’ve got a family to think about now.”\nYOUTH: I can relate all too well to how he must feel.\nPHILOSOPHER: He should just enter his writing for an award, and if he gets rejected, so be it.\nIf he did, he might grow, or discover that he should pursue something di\u0000erent. Either way,\nhe would be able to move on. That is what changing your current lifestyle is about. He won’t\nget anywhere by not submitting anything.\nYOUTH: But maybe his dreams will be shattered.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, I wonder. Having simple tasks—things that should be done—while\ncontinually coming up with various reasons why one can’t do them sounds like a hard way to\nlive, doesn’t it? So in the case of my friend who dreams of becoming a novelist, it is clearly the\n“I,” or the “self,” that is making life complicated and too di\u0000cult to live happily.\nYOUTH: But . . . That’s harsh. Your philosophy is too tough!\nPHILOSOPHER: Indeed, it is strong medicine.\nYOUTH: Strong medicine! Yes, I agree.\nPHILOSOPHER: But if you change your lifestyle—the way of giving meaning to the world and\nyourself—then both your way of interacting with the world and your behavior will have to\nchange as well. Do not forget this point: One will have to change. You, just as you are, have to\nchoose your lifestyle. It might seem hard, but it is really quite simple.\nYOUTH: According to you, there’s no such thing as trauma, and environment doesn’t matter\neither. It’s all just baggage, and my unhappiness is my own fault, right? I’m starting to feel I’m\nbeing criticized for everything I’ve ever been and done!\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: No, you are not being criticized. Rather, as Adler’s teleology tells us, “No\nmatter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how\nyou live from now on.” That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines\nyour own life.\nYOUTH: My life is determined at this exact point?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, because the past does not exist.\nYOUTH: All right. Well, I don’t agree with your theories one hundred percent. There are many\npoints I’m not convinced about and that I would argue against. At the same time, your\ntheories are worth further consideration, and I’m de\u0000nitely interested in learning more about\nAdlerian psychology. I think I’ve had enough for tonight, but I hope you won’t mind if I\ncome again next week. If I don’t take a break, I think my head might burst.\nPHILOSOPHER: I’m sure you need some time on your own to think things over. I am always\nhere, so you can visit whenever you like. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Let’s talk again.\nYOUTH: Great! One last thing, if I may. Our discussion today was long and got pretty intense,\nand I guess I spoke rather rudely. For that, I would like to apologize.\nPHILOSOPHER: Don’t worry about it. You should read Plato’s dialogues. The conduct and\nlanguage of the disciples of Socrates are surprisingly loose. That’s the way a dialogue is\nsupposed to be."

    "raw_text": "THE SECOND NIGHT:\nAll Problems Are Interpersonal\nRelationship Problems\n\f\nThe young man was as good as his word. Exactly one week later, he returned to the\nphilosopher’s study. Truth be told, he’d felt the urge to rush back there only two or three days\nafter his \u0000rst visit. He had turned things over in his mind very carefully, and his doubts had\nturned to certainty. In short, teleology, the attributing of the purpose of a given\nphenomenon, rather than its cause, was a sophistry, and the existence of trauma was beyond\nquestion. People cannot simply forget the past, and neither can they become free from it.\nToday, the young man decided, he’d thoroughly dismantle this eccentric philosopher’s\ntheories and settle matters once and for all.\n\f\nWhy You Dislike Yourself\nYOUTH: So after last time, I calmed myself down, focused, and thought things over. And yet,\nI’ve got to say, I still can’t agree with your theories.\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh? What do you \u0000nd questionable about them?\nYOUTH: Well, for instance, the other day I admitted that I dislike myself. No matter what I\ndo, I can’t \u0000nd anything but shortcomings, and I can see no reason why I’d start liking myself.\nBut of course I still want to. You explain everything as having to do with goals, but what kind\nof goal could I have here? I mean, what kind of advantage could there be in my not liking\nmyself? I can’t imagine there’d be a single thing to gain from it.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. You feel that you don’t have any strong points, that you’ve got nothing\nbut shortcomings. Whatever the facts might be, that’s how you feel. In other words, your\nself-esteem is extremely low. So the questions here, then, are why do you feel so wretched?\nAnd, why do you view yourself with such low esteem?\nYOUTH: Because that’s a fact—I really don’t have any strong points.\nPHILOSOPHER: You’re wrong. You notice only your shortcomings because you’ve resolved to\nnot start liking yourself. In order to not like yourself, you don’t see your strong points and\nfocus only on your shortcomings. First, understand this point.\nYOUTH: I have resolved to not start liking myself?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. To you, not liking yourself is a virtue.\nYOUTH: Why? What for?\nPHILOSOPHER: Perhaps this is something you should think about yourself. What sort of\nshortcomings do you think you have?\nYOUTH: I’m sure you have already noticed. First of all, there’s my personality. I don’t have any\nself-con\u0000dence, and I’m always pessimistic about everything. And I guess I’m too self-\nconscious, because I worry about what other people see, and then, I live with a constant\n\f\ndistrust of other people. I can never act naturally; there’s always something theatrical about\nwhat I say and do. And it’s not just my personality—there’s nothing to like about my face or\nmy body, either.\nPHILOSOPHER: When you go about listing your shortcomings like that, what kind of mood\ndoes it put you in?\nYOUTH: Wow, that’s nasty! An unpleasant mood, naturally. I’m sure that no one would want\nto get involved with a guy as warped as me. If there were anyone this wretched and\nbothersome in my vicinity, I’d keep my distance, too.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. Well, that settles it, then.\nYOUTH: What do you mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: It might be hard to understand from your own example, so I’ll use another. I\nuse this study for simple counseling sessions. It must have been quite a few years ago, but\nthere was a female student who came by. She sat right where you are sitting now, in the same\nchair. Well, her concern was her fear of blushing. She told me that she was always turning red\nwhenever she was out in public, and that she would do anything to rid herself of this. So I\nasked her, “Well, if you can cure it, what will you want to do then?” And she said that there\nwas a man she wanted. She secretly had feelings for him but wasn’t ready to divulge them.\nOnce her fear of blushing was cured, she’d confess her desire to be with him.\nYOUTH: Huh! All right, it sounds like the typical thing a female student would seek\ncounseling for. In order for her to confess her feelings for him, \u0000rst she had to cure her\nblushing problem.\nPHILOSOPHER: But is that really the whole case? I have a di\u0000erent opinion. Why did she get\nthis fear of blushing? And why hadn’t it gotten better? Because she needed that symptom of\nblushing.\nYOUTH: What are you saying exactly? She was asking you to cure it, wasn’t she?\nPHILOSOPHER: What do you think was the scariest thing to her, the thing she wanted to avoid\nmost of all? It was that the man would reject her, of course. The fact that her unrequited love\nwould negate everything for her, the very existence and possibility of “I.” This aspect is deeply\npresent in adolescent unrequited love. But as long as she has a fear of blushing, she can go on\nthinking, I can’t be with him because I have this fear of blushing. It could end without her ever\nworking up the courage to confess her feelings to him, and she could convince herself that he\nwould reject her anyway. And \u0000nally, she can live in the possibility that If only my fear of\nblushing had gotten better, I could have . . .\n\f\nYOUTH: Okay, so she fabricated that fear of blushing as an excuse for her own inability to\nconfess her feelings. Or maybe as a kind of insurance for when he rejected her.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, you could put it that way.\nYOUTH: Okay, that is an interesting interpretation. But if that were really the case, wouldn’t it\nbe impossible to do anything to help her? Since she simultaneously needs that fear of\nblushing and is su\u0000ering because of it, there’d be no end to her troubles.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, this is what I told her: “Fear of blushing is easy to cure.” She asked,\n“Really?” I went on: “But I will not cure it.” She pressed me “Why?” I explained, “Look, it’s\nthanks to your fear of blushing that you can accept your dissatisfaction with yourself and the\nworld around you, and with a life that isn’t going well. It’s thanks to your fear of blushing,\nand it’s caused by it.” She asked, “How could it be . . . ?” I went on: “If I did cure it, and\nnothing in your situation changed at all, what would you do? You’d probably come here\nagain and say, ‘Give me back my fear of blushing.’ And that would be beyond my abilities.”\nYOUTH: Hmm.\nPHILOSOPHER: Her story certainly isn’t unusual. Students preparing for their exams think, If\nI pass, life will be rosy. Company workers think, If I get transferred, everything will go well.\nBut even when those wishes are ful\u0000lled, in many cases nothing about their situations\nchanges at all.\nYOUTH: Indeed.\nPHILOSOPHER: When a client shows up requesting a cure from fear of blushing, the counselor\nmust not cure the symptoms. Then recovery is likely to be even more di\u0000cult. That is the\nAdlerian psychology way of thinking about this kind of thing.\nYOUTH: So what speci\u0000cally do you do, then? Do you ask what they’re worried about and\nthen just leave it be?\nPHILOSOPHER: She didn’t have con\u0000dence in herself. She was very afraid that things being\nwhat they were, he’d reject her even if she did confess to him. And if that happened, she’d lose\neven more con\u0000dence and get hurt. That’s why she created the symptom of the fear of\nblushing. What I can do is to get the person \u0000rst to accept “myself now,” and then regardless\nof the outcome have the courage to step forward. In Adlerian psychology, this kind of\napproach is called “encouragement.”\nYOUTH: Encouragement?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. I’ll explain systematically what it consists of once our discussion has\nprogressed a little further. We’re not at that stage yet.\nYOUTH: That works for me. In the meantime, I’ll keep the word “encouragement” in mind.\nSo whatever happened to her?\nPHILOSOPHER: Apparently, she had the chance to join a group of friends and spend time with\nthe man, and in the end it was he who confessed his desire to be with her. Of course, she\nnever dropped by this study again after that. I don’t know what became of her fear of\nblushing. But she probably didn’t need it any longer.\nYOUTH: Yes, she clearly didn’t have any use for it anymore.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Now, keeping this student’s story in mind, let’s think about your\nproblems. You say that, at present, you notice only your shortcomings, and it’s unlikely that\nyou’ll ever come to like yourself. And then you said, “I’m sure that no one would want to get\ninvolved with a guy as warped as me.” I’m sure you understand this already. Why do you\ndislike yourself? Why do you focus only on your shortcomings, and why have you decided to\nnot start liking yourself? It’s because you are overly afraid of being disliked by other people\nand getting hurt in your interpersonal relationships.\nYOUTH: What do you mean by that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Just like the young woman with the fear of blushing, who was afraid of being\nrejected by the man, you are afraid of being negated by other people. You’re afraid of being\ntreated disparagingly, being refused, and sustaining deep mental wounds. You think that\ninstead of getting entangled in such situations, it would be better if you just didn’t have\nrelations with anyone in the \u0000rst place. In other words, your goal is to not get hurt in your\nrelationships with other people.\nYOUTH: Huh . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Now, how can that goal be realized? The answer is easy. Just \u0000nd your\nshortcomings, start disliking yourself, and become someone who doesn’t enter into\ninterpersonal relationships. That way, if you can shut yourself into your own shell, you won’t\nhave to interact with anyone, and you’ll even have a justi\u0000cation ready whenever other people\nsnub you. That it’s because of your shortcomings that you get snubbed, and if things weren’t\nthis way, you too could be loved.\nYOUTH: Ha-ha! Well, you’ve really put me in my place now.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Don’t be evasive. Being “the way I am” with all these shortcomings is, for you,\na precious virtue. In other words, something that’s to your bene\u0000t.\nYOUTH: Ouch, that hurts. What a sadist; you’re diabolical! Okay, yes, it’s true: I am afraid. I\ndon’t want to get hurt in interpersonal relationships. I’m terri\u0000ed of being snubbed for who I\nam. It’s hard to admit it, but you are right.\nPHILOSOPHER: Admitting is a good attitude. But don’t forget, it’s basically impossible to not\nget hurt in your relations with other people. When you enter into interpersonal relationships,\nit is inevitable that to a greater or lesser extent you will get hurt, and you will hurt someone,\ntoo. Adler says, “To get rid of one’s problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone.”\nBut one can’t do such a thing."

    "raw_text": "All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship\nProblems\nYOUTH: Wait a minute! I’m supposed to just let that one slip by? “To get rid of one’s\nproblems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone”? What do you mean by that? If you\nlived all alone, wouldn’t you be horribly lonely?\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh, but being alone isn’t what makes you feel lonely. Loneliness is having\nother people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being\nexcluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other people. That is to say, it is only in social\ncontexts that a person becomes an “individual.”\nYOUTH: If you were really alone, that is, if you existed completely alone in the universe, you\nwouldn’t be an individual and you wouldn’t feel lonely, either?\nPHILOSOPHER: I suppose the very concept of loneliness wouldn’t even come up. You\nwouldn’t need language, and there’d be no use for logic or common sense, either. But such a\nthing is impossible. Even if you lived on an uninhabited island, you would think about\nsomeone far across the ocean. Even if you spend your nights alone, you strain your ears to\nhear the sound of someone’s breath. As long as there is someone out there somewhere, you\nwill be haunted by loneliness.\nYOUTH: But then you could just rephrase that as, “If one could live in the universe all alone,\none’s problems would go away,” couldn’t you?\nPHILOSOPHER: In theory, yes. As Adler goes so far as to assert, “All problems are interpersonal\nrelationship problems.”\nYOUTH: Can you say that again?\nPHILOSOPHER: We can repeat it as many times as you like: All problems are interpersonal\nrelationship problems. This is a concept that runs to the very root of Adlerian psychology. If\nall interpersonal relationships were gone from this world, which is to say if one were alone in\nthe universe and all other people were gone, all manner of problems would disappear.\n\f\nYOUTH: That’s a lie! It’s nothing more than academic sophistry.\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, we cannot do without interpersonal relationships. A human\nbeing’s existence, in its very essence, assumes the existence of other human beings. Living\ncompletely separate from others is, in principle, impossible. As you are indicating, the\npremise “If one could live all alone in the universe” is unsound.\nYOUTH: That’s not the issue I am talking about. Sure, interpersonal relationships are\nprobably a big problem. That much I acknowledge. But to say that everything comes down\nto interpersonal relationship problems, now that’s really an extreme position. What about\nthe worry of being cut o\u0000 from interpersonal relationships, the kind of problems that an\nindividual agonizes over as an individual, problems directed to oneself? Do you deny all that?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no such thing as worry that is completely de\u0000ned by the individual;\nso-called internal worry does not exist. Whatever the worry that may arise, the shadows of\nother people are always present.\nYOUTH: But still, you’re a philosopher. Human beings have loftier, greater problems than\nthings like interpersonal relationships. What is happiness? What is freedom? And what is the\nmeaning of life? Aren’t these the themes that philosophers have been investigating ever since\nthe ancient Greeks? And you’re saying, So what? Interpersonal relationships are everything?\nIt seems kind of pedestrian to me. It’s hard to believe that a philosopher would say such\nthings.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, then, it seems there’s a need to explain things a bit more concretely.\nYOUTH: Yes, please do! If you’re going to tell me that you’re a philosopher, then you’ve got to\nreally explain things, or else this makes no sense.\nPHILOSOPHER: You were so afraid of interpersonal relationships that you came to dislike\nyourself. You’ve avoided interpersonal relationships by disliking yourself.\nThese assertions shook the youth to his very core. The words had an undeniable truth\nthat seemed to pierce his heart. Even so, he had to \u0000nd a clear rebuttal to the\nstatement that all the problems that people experience are interpersonal relationship\nproblems. Adler was trivializing people’s issues. The problems I’m suﬀering from\naren’t so mundane!\n\f\nFeelings of Inferiority Are Subjective Assumptions\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s look at interpersonal relationships from a slightly di\u0000erent perspective.\nAre you familiar with the term “feeling of inferiority”?\nYOUTH: What a silly question. As you can surely tell from our discussion up to now, I’m just\na huge blob of feelings of inferiority.\nPHILOSOPHER: What are those feelings, speci\u0000cally?\nYOUTH: Well, for instance, if I see something in a newspaper about a person around my age,\nsomeone who’s really successful, I’m always overcome with these feelings of inferiority. If\nsomeone else who’s lived the same amount of time I have is so successful, then what on earth\nam I doing with myself? Or when I see a friend who seems happy, before I even feel like\ncelebrating with him, I’m \u0000lled with envy and frustration. Of course, this pimple-covered\nface doesn’t help matters, and I’ve got strong feelings of inferiority when it comes to my\neducation and occupation. And then there’s my income and social standing. I guess I’m just\ncompletely riddled with feelings of inferiority.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. Incidentally, Adler is thought to be the \u0000rst to use the term “feeling of\ninferiority” in the kind of context in which it is spoken of today.\nYOUTH: Huh, I didn’t know that.\nPHILOSOPHER: In Adler’s native German, the word is Minderwertigkeitsgefühl, which means\na feeling (Gefühl) of having less (minder) worth (Wert). So “feeling of inferiority” has to do\nwith one’s value judgment of oneself.\nYOUTH: Value judgment?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s the feeling that one has no worth, or that one is worth only so much.\nYOUTH: Ah, that’s a feeling I know well. That’s me in a nutshell. Not a day goes by without\nme tormenting myself that there’s no point in being alive.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, then, let’s have a look at my own feelings of inferiority. When you \u0000rst\nmet me, what was your impression? In terms of physical characteristics.\nYOUTH: Um, well . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: There’s no need to hold back. Be direct.\nYOUTH: All right, I guess you were smaller than I’d imagined.\nPHILOSOPHER: Thank you. I am 61 inches tall. Adler was apparently around the same height.\nThere was a time—until I was right around your age, actually—when I was concerned about\nmy height. I was sure that things would be di\u0000erent if I were of average height, eight or even\njust four inches taller. As if a more enjoyable life were waiting for me. I talked to a friend\nabout it when I was having these feelings, and he said it was “a bunch of nonsense” and\nsimply dismissed it.\nYOUTH: That’s horrible! Some friend.\nPHILOSOPHER: And then he said, “What would you do if you got taller? You know, you’ve\ngot a gift for getting people to relax.” With a man who’s big and strong, it’s true, it does seem\nhe can end up intimidating people just because of his size. With someone small like me, on\nthe other hand, people let go of their wariness. So it made me realize that having a small build\nwas a desirable thing both to me and to those around me. In other words, there was a\ntransformation of values. I’m not worried about my height anymore.\nYOUTH: Okay, but that’s—\nPHILOSOPHER: Wait until I am \u0000nished. The important thing here is that my height of 61\ninches wasn’t inferior.\nYOUTH: It wasn’t inferior?\nPHILOSOPHER: It was not, in fact, lacking in or lesser than something. Sure, my 61 inches is\nless than the average height, and an objectively measured number. At \u0000rst glance, one might\nthink it inferior. But the issue is really what sort of meaning I attribute to that height, what\nsort of value I give it.\nYOUTH: What does that mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: My feelings about my height were all subjective feelings of inferiority, which\narose entirely through my comparing myself to others. That is to say, in my interpersonal\nrelationships. Because if there hadn’t been anyone with whom to compare myself, I wouldn’t\n\f\nhave had any occasion to think I was short. Right now, you too are su\u0000ering from various\nfeelings of inferiority. But please understand that what you are feeling is not an objective\ninferiority but a subjective feeling of inferiority. Even with an issue like height, it’s all reduced\nto its subjectivity.\nYOUTH: In other words, the feelings of inferiority we’re su\u0000ering from are subjective\ninterpretations rather than objective facts?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Seeing it from my friend’s point of view that I get people to relax or\nthat I don’t intimidate them—such aspects can become strong points. Of course, this is a\nsubjective interpretation. You could even say it’s an arbitrary assumption. However, there is\none good thing about subjectivity: It allows you to make your own choice. Precisely because I\nam leaving it to subjectivity, the choice to view my height as either an advantage or\ndisadvantage is left open to me.\nYOUTH: The argument that you can choose a new lifestyle?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. We cannot alter objective facts. But subjective interpretations can\nbe altered as much as one likes. And we are inhabitants of a subjective world. We talked about\nthis at the very beginning, right?\nYOUTH: Yes; the well water that’s sixty degrees.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now, remember the German word for a feeling of inferiority,\nMinderwertigkeitsgefühl. As I mentioned a moment ago, “feeling of inferiority” is a term that\nhas to do with one’s value judgment of oneself. So what on earth could this value be? Okay,\ntake diamonds, for instance, which are traded at a high value. Or currency. We \u0000nd particular\nvalues for these things and say that one carat is this much, that prices are such and such. But\nif you change your point of view, a diamond is nothing but a little stone.\nYOUTH: Well, intellectually it is.\nPHILOSOPHER: In other words, value is something that’s based on a social context. The value\ngiven to a one-dollar bill is not an objectively attributed value, though that might be a\ncommonsense approach. If one considers its actual cost as printed material, the value is\nnowhere near a dollar. If I were the only person in this world and no one else existed, I’d\nprobably be putting those one-dollar bills in my \u0000replace in wintertime. Maybe I’d be using\nthem to blow my nose. Following exactly the same logic, there should have been no reason at\nall for me to worry about my height.\nYOUTH: If you were the only person in this world and no one else existed?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. The problem of value in the end brings us back to interpersonal\nrelationships again.\nYOUTH: So this connects to what you were saying about all problems being interpersonal\nrelationship problems?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, that’s correct.\n\f\nAn Inferiority Complex Is an Excuse\nYOUTH: But can you say for sure that feelings of inferiority are really a problem of\ninterpersonal relationships? Even the kind of person who is regarded socially as a success,\nwho doesn’t need to debase himself in relationships with other people, still has some feelings\nof inferiority? Even the businessman who amasses enormous wealth, the peerless beauty who\nis the envy of all, and the Olympic gold medalist—every one of them would be plagued by\nfeelings of inferiority. Well, that’s how it seems to me. How should I think about this?\nPHILOSOPHER: Adler recognizes that feelings of inferiority are something everyone has.\nThere’s nothing bad about feelings of inferiority themselves.\nYOUTH: So why do people have them in the \u0000rst place?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s probably necessary to understand this in a certain order. First of all, people\nenter this world as helpless beings. And people have the universal desire to escape from that\nhelpless state. Adler called this the “pursuit of superiority.”\nYOUTH: Pursuit of superiority?\nPHILOSOPHER: This is something you could think of as simply “hoping to improve” or\n“pursuing an ideal state.” For instance, a toddler learns to steady himself on both legs. He has\nthe universal desire to learn language and to improve. And all the advancements of science\nthroughout human history are due to this “pursuit of superiority,” too.\nYOUTH: Okay. And then?\nPHILOSOPHER: The counterpart of this is the feeling of inferiority. Everyone is in this\n“condition of wanting to improve” that is the pursuit of superiority. One holds up various\nideals or goals and heads toward them. However, on not being able to reach one’s ideals, one\nharbors a sense of being lesser. For instance, there are chefs who, the more inspired and\naccomplished they become, are forever beset with the sort of feeling of inferiority that makes\nthem say to themselves, I’m still not good enough, or I’ve got to bring my cooking to the next\nlevel, and that sort of thing.\nYOUTH: That’s true.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Adler is saying that the pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are\nnot diseases but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. If it is not used in the\nwrong way, the feeling of inferiority, too, can promote striving and growth.\nYOUTH: The feeling of inferiority is a kind of launch pad?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. One tries to get rid of one’s feeling of inferiority and keep\nmoving forward. One’s never satis\u0000ed with one’s present situation—even if it’s just a single\nstep, one wants to make progress. One wants to be happier. There is absolutely nothing\nwrong with the state of this kind of feeling of inferiority. There are, however, people who lose\nthe courage to take a single step forward, who cannot accept the fact that the situation can be\nchanged by making realistic e\u0000orts. People who, before even doing anything, simply give up\nand say things like “I’m not good enough anyway” or “Even if I tried, I wouldn’t stand a\nchance.”\nYOUTH: Well, that’s true. There’s no doubt about it—if the feeling of inferiority is strong,\nmost people will become negative and say, “I’m not good enough anyway.” Because that’s\nwhat a feeling of inferiority is.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, that’s not a feeling of inferiority—that’s an inferiority complex.\nYOUTH: A complex? That’s what the feeling of inferiority is, isn’t it?\nPHILOSOPHER: Be careful. The way the word “complex” is used today, it seems to have the\nsame meaning as “feeling of inferiority.” You hear people saying, “I’ve got a complex about\nmy eyelids,” or “He’s got a complex about his education,” that sort of thing. This is an utter\nmisuse of the term. At base, “complex” refers to an abnormal mental state made up of a\ncomplicated group of emotions and ideas, and has nothing to do with the feeling of\ninferiority. For instance, there’s Freud’s Oedipus complex, which is used in the context of\ndiscussing the abnormal attraction of the child to the opposite-sex parent.\nYOUTH: Yes. The nuances of abnormality are especially strong when it comes to the mother\ncomplex and the father complex.\nPHILOSOPHER: For the same reason, then, it’s crucial to not mix up “feeling of inferiority”\nand “inferiority complex,” and to think about them as clearly separate.\nYOUTH: Concretely, how are they di\u0000erent?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is nothing particularly wrong with the feeling of inferiority itself. You\nunderstand this point now, right? As Adler says, the feeling of inferiority can be a trigger for\nstriving and growth. For instance, if one had a feeling of inferiority with regard to one’s\n\f\neducation, and resolved to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I’ll just have to try harder than\nanyone else, that would be a desirable direction. The inferiority complex, on the other hand,\nrefers to a condition of having begun to use one’s feeling of inferiority as a kind of excuse. So\none thinks to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed, or I’m not good-looking, so I\ncan’t get married. When someone is insisting on the logic of “A is the situation, so B cannot\nbe done” in such a way in everyday life, that is not something that \u0000ts in the feeling of\ninferiority category. It is an inferiority complex.\nYOUTH: No, it’s a legitimate causal relationship. If you’re not well educated, it takes away\nyour chances of getting work or making it in the world. You’re regarded as low on the social\nscale, and you can’t succeed. That’s not an excuse at all. It’s just a cold hard fact, isn’t it?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, you are wrong.\nYOUTH: How? Where am I wrong?\nPHILOSOPHER: What you are calling a causal relationship is something that Adler explains as\n“apparent cause and e\u0000ect.” That is to say, you convince yourself that there is some serious\ncausal relationship where there is none whatsoever. The other day, someone told me, “The\nreason I can’t get married easily is that my parents got divorced when I was a child.” From the\nviewpoint of Freudian etiology (the attributing of causes), the parents’ divorce was a great\ntrauma, which connects in a clear causal relationship with one’s views on marriage. Adler,\nhowever, with his stance of teleology (the attributing of purpose), rejects such arguments as\n“apparent cause and e\u0000ect.”\nYOUTH: But even so, the reality is that having a good education makes it easier to be successful\nin society. I had thought you were wise to the ways of the world.\nPHILOSOPHER: The real issue is how one confronts that reality. If what you are thinking is,\nI’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed, then instead of I can’t succeed, you should think, I\ndon’t want to succeed.\nYOUTH: I don’t want to succeed? What kind of reasoning is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s simply that it’s scary to take even one step forward; also, that you don’t\nwant to make realistic e\u0000orts. You don’t want to change so much that you’d be willing to\nsacri\u0000ce the pleasures you enjoy now—for instance, the time you spend playing and engaged\nin hobbies. In other words, you’re not equipped with the courage to change your lifestyle. It’s\neasier with things just as they are now, even if you have some complaints or limitations.\n\f\nBraggarts Have Feelings of Inferiority\nYOUTH: Maybe so, but . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Further, you harbor an inferiority complex about education and think, I’m\nnot well educated, so I can’t succeed. Put the other way around, the reasoning can be, If only I\nwere well educated, I could be really successful.\nYOUTH: Hmm, true.\nPHILOSOPHER: This is the other aspect of the inferiority complex. Those who manifest their\ninferiority complexes in words or attitudes, who say that “A is the situation, so B cannot be\ndone,” are implying that if only it were not for A, they’d be capable and have value.\nYOUTH: If only it weren’t for this, I could do it, too.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. As Adler points out, no one is capable of putting up with having feelings\nof inferiority for a long period of time. Feelings of inferiority are something that everyone\nhas, but staying in that condition is too heavy to endure forever.\nYOUTH: Huh? This is getting pretty confusing.\nPHILOSOPHER: Okay, let’s go over things one at a time. The condition of having a feeling of\ninferiority is a condition of feeling some sort of lack in oneself in the present situation. So\nthen, the question is—\nYOUTH: How do you \u0000ll in the part that’s missing, right?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. How to compensate for the part that is lacking. The healthiest way is\nto try to compensate through striving and growth. For instance, it could be by applying\noneself to one’s studies, engaging in constant training, or being diligent in one’s work.\nHowever, people who aren’t equipped with that courage end up stepping into an inferiority\ncomplex. Again, it’s thinking, I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed. And it’s implying your\ncapability by saying, “If only I were well educated, I could be really successful.” That “the real\nme,” which just happens to be obscured right now by the matter of education, is superior.\n\f\nYOUTH: No, that doesn’t make sense—the second thing you’re saying is beyond a feeling of\ninferiority. That’s really more bravado than anything else, isn’t it?\nPHILOSOPHER: Indeed. The inferiority complex can also develop into another special mental\nstate.\nYOUTH: And what is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: I doubt you have heard much about it. It’s the “superiority complex.”\nYOUTH: Superiority complex?\nPHILOSOPHER: One is su\u0000ering from strong feelings of inferiority, and, on top of that, one\ndoesn’t have the courage to compensate through healthy modes of striving and growth. That\nbeing said, one can’t tolerate the inferiority complex of thinking, A is the situation, so B\ncannot be done. One can’t accept “one’s incapable self.” At that point, the person thinks of\ntrying to compensate in some other fashion and looks for an easier way out.\nYOUTH: What way is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s to act as if one is indeed superior and to indulge in a fabricated feeling of\nsuperiority.\nYOUTH: A fabricated feeling of superiority?\nPHILOSOPHER: A familiar example would be “giving authority.”\nYOUTH: What does that mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: One makes a show of being on good terms with a powerful person (broadly\nspeaking—it could be anyone from the leader of your school class to a famous celebrity). And\nby doing that, one lets it be known that one is special. Behaviors like misrepresenting one’s\nwork experience or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing are forms of giving\nauthority, and probably also have aspects of the superiority complex. In each case, it isn’t that\nthe “I” is actually superior or special. It is only that one is making the “I” look superior by\nlinking it to authority. In short, it’s a fabricated feeling of superiority.\nYOUTH: And at the base of that, there is an intense feeling of inferiority?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. I don’t know much about fashion, but I think it’s advisable to\nthink of people who wear rings with rubies and emeralds on all their \u0000ngers as having issues\nwith feelings of inferiority, rather than issues of aesthetic sensibility. In other words, they have\nsigns of a superiority complex.\n\f\nYOUTH: Right.\nPHILOSOPHER: But those who make themselves look bigger on borrowed power are essentially\nliving according to other people’s value systems—they are living other people’s lives. This is a\npoint that must be emphasized.\nYOUTH: So, a superiority complex. That’s a very interesting psychology. Can you give me a\ndi\u0000erent example?\nPHILOSOPHER: There’s the kind of person who likes to boast about his achievements.\nSomeone who clings to his past glory and is always recounting memories of the time when his\nlight shone brightest. Maybe you know some people like this. All such people can be said to\nhave superiority complexes.\nYOUTH: The kind of man who boasts about his achievements? Yes, it is an arrogant attitude,\nbut he can boast because he actually is superior. You can’t call that a fabricated feeling of\nsuperiority.\nPHILOSOPHER: Ah, but you are wrong. Those who go so far as to boast about things out loud\nactually have no con\u0000dence in themselves. As Adler clearly indicates, “The one who boasts\ndoes so only out of a feeling of inferiority.”\nYOUTH: You’re saying that boasting is an inverted feeling of inferiority?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. If one really has con\u0000dence in oneself, one doesn’t feel the need\nto boast. It’s because one’s feeling of inferiority is strong that one boasts. One feels the need\nto \u0000aunt one’s superiority all the more. There’s the fear that if one doesn’t do that, not a\nsingle person will accept one “the way I am.” This is a full-blown superiority complex.\nYOUTH: So though one would think from the sound of the words that inferiority complex\nand superiority complex were polar opposites, in actuality they border on each other?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, they are clearly connected. Now, there is one last example I’d like to give, a\ncomplex example that deals with boasting. It is a pattern leading to a particular feeling of\nsuperiority that manifests due to the feeling of inferiority itself becoming intensi\u0000ed.\nConcretely speaking, it’s bragging about one’s own misfortune.\nYOUTH: Bragging about one’s own misfortune?\nPHILOSOPHER: The person who assumes a boasting manner when talking about his\nupbringing and the like, the various misfortunes that have rained down upon him. If\n\f\nsomeone should try to comfort this person, or suggest some change be made, he’ll refuse the\nhelping hand by saying, “You don’t understand how I feel.”\nYOUTH: Well, there are people like that, but . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Such people try to make themselves “special” by way of their experience of\nmisfortune, and with the single fact of their misfortune try to place themselves above others.\nTake the fact that I am short, for instance. Let’s say that kind-hearted people come up to me\nand say, “It’s nothing to worry about,” or “Such things have nothing to do with human\nvalues.” Now, if I were to reject them and say, “You think you know what short people go\nthrough, huh?” no one would say a thing to me anymore. I’m sure that everyone around me\nwould start treating me just as if I were a boil about to burst and would handle me very\ncarefully—or, I should say, circumspectly.\nYOUTH: Absolutely true.\nPHILOSOPHER: By doing that, my position becomes superior to other people’s, and I can\nbecome special. Quite a few people try to be “special” by adopting this kind of attitude when\nthey are sick or injured, or su\u0000ering the mental anguish of heartbreak.\nYOUTH: So they reveal their feeling of inferiority and use it to their advantage?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. They use their misfortune to their advantage and try to control the other\nparty with it. By declaring how unfortunate they are and how much they have su\u0000ered, they\nare trying to worry the people around them (their family and friends, for example), and to\nrestrict their speech and behavior, and control them. The people I was talking about at the\nvery beginning, who shut themselves up in their rooms, frequently indulge in feelings of\nsuperiority and use misfortune to their advantage. So much so that Adler himself pointed\nout, “In our culture weakness can be quite strong and powerful.”\nYOUTH: So weakness is powerful?\nPHILOSOPHER: Adler says, “In fact, if we were to ask ourselves who is the strongest person in\nour culture, the logical answer would be, the baby. The baby rules and cannot be\ndominated.” The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And it is because of this\nweakness that no one can control him.\nYOUTH: I’ve never encountered that viewpoint.\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, the words of the person who has been hurt—“You don’t\nunderstand how I feel”—are likely to contain a certain degree of truth. Completely\nunderstanding the feelings of the person who is su\u0000ering is something that no one is capable\n\f\nof. But as long as one continues to use one’s misfortune to one’s advantage in order to be\n“special,” one will always need that misfortune.\nThe youth and philosopher had now covered a series of discussion topics: the feeling\nof inferiority, the inferiority complex, and the superiority complex. Psychology\nkeywords though they clearly were, the truths they contained di\u0000ered greatly from\nthe youth’s imagined meanings. Still, something didn’t feel right to him, somehow.\nWhat is it about all this that I’m having a hard time accepting? Well, it must be the\nintroductory part, the premise, that is giving me doubts. The youth calmly opened his\nmouth to speak.\n\f\nLife Is Not a Competition\nYOUTH: But I guess I still don’t really get it.\nPHILOSOPHER: Okay, ask me anything you like.\nYOUTH: Adler recognizes that the pursuit of superiority—one’s trying to be a more superior\nbeing—is a universal desire, doesn’t he? On the other hand, he’s striking a note of warning\nwith regard to excessive feelings of inferiority and superiority. It’d be easy to understand if he\ncould renounce the pursuit of superiority—then I could accept it. What are we supposed to\ndo?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think about it this way. When we refer to the pursuit of superiority, there’s a\ntendency to think of it as the desire to try to be superior to other people; to climb higher,\neven if it means kicking others down—you know, the image of ascending a stairway and\npushing people out of the way to get to the top. Adler does not uphold such attitudes, of\ncourse. Rather, he’s saying that on the same level playing \u0000eld, there are people who are\nmoving forward, and there are people who are moving forward behind them. Keep that\nimage in mind. Though the distance covered and the speed of walking di\u0000er, everyone is\nwalking equally in the same \u0000at place. The pursuit of superiority is the mind-set of taking a\nsingle step forward on one’s own feet, not the mind-set of competition of the sort that\nnecessitates aiming to be greater than other people.\nYOUTH: So life is not a competition?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. It’s enough to just keep moving in a forward direction, without\ncompeting with anyone. And, of course, there is no need to compare oneself with others.\nYOUTH: No, that’s impossible. We’ll always compare ourselves to other people, no matter\nwhat. That’s exactly where our feeling of inferiority comes from, isn’t it?\nPHILOSOPHER: A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing\noneself to others; it comes from one’s comparison with one’s ideal self.\nYOUTH: But . . .\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Look, all of us are di\u0000erent. Gender, age, knowledge, experience, appearance\n—no two of us are exactly the same. Let’s acknowledge in a positive manner the fact that\nother people are di\u0000erent from us. And that we are not the same, but we are equal.\nYOUTH: We are not the same, but we are equal?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Everyone is di\u0000erent. Don’t mix up that di\u0000erence with good\nand bad, and superior and inferior. Whatever di\u0000erences we may have, we are all equal.\nYOUTH: No distinction of rank for people. Idealistically speaking, I suppose so. But aren’t we\ntrying to have an honest discussion about reality now? Would you really say, for instance, that\nI, an adult, and a child who is still struggling with his arithmetic are equal?\nPHILOSOPHER: In terms of the amount of knowledge and experience, and then the amount of\nresponsibility that can be taken, there are bound to be di\u0000erences. The child might not be\nable to tie his shoes properly, or \u0000gure out complicated mathematical equations, or be able to\ntake the same degree of responsibility as an adult when problems arise. However, such things\nshouldn’t have anything to do with human values. My answer is the same. Human beings are\nall equal, but not the same.\nYOUTH: Then are you saying that a child should be treated like a full-grown adult?\nPHILOSOPHER: No. Instead of treating the child like an adult, or like a child, one must treat\nhim or her like a human being. One interacts with the child with sincerity, as another human\nbeing just like oneself.\nYOUTH: Let’s change the question. All people are equal. They’re on the same level playing\n\u0000eld. But actually, there’s a disparity here, isn’t there? Those who move forward are superior,\nand those who pursue them from behind are inferior. So we end up at the problem of\nsuperior and inferior, don’t we?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, we do not. It does not matter if one is trying to walk in front of others or\nwalk behind them. It is as if we are moving through a \u0000at space that has no vertical axis. We\ndo not walk in order to compete with someone. It is in trying to progress past who one is\nnow that there is value.\nYOUTH: Have you become free from all forms of competition?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. I do not think about gaining status or honor, and I live my life as\nan outsider philosopher without any connection whatsoever to worldly competition.\n\f\nYOUTH: Does that mean you dropped out of competition? That you somehow accepted\ndefeat?\nPHILOSOPHER: No. I withdrew from places that are preoccupied with winning and losing.\nWhen one is trying to be oneself, competition will inevitably get in the way.\nYOUTH: No way! That’s a tired-out old man’s argument. Young folks like me have to pull\nthemselves up by their own bootstraps amid the tension of competition. It’s because I don’t\nhave a rival running alongside me that I can’t outdo myself. What’s wrong with thinking of\ninterpersonal relationships as competitive?\nPHILOSOPHER: If that rival was someone you could call a comrade, it’s possible that it would\nlead to self-improvement. But in many cases, a competitor will not be your comrade.\nYOUTH: Meaning what, exactly?"

    "raw_text": "You’re the Only One Worrying About Your\nAppearance\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s tie up the loose ends. At the outset, you expressed dissatisfaction with\nAdler’s de\u0000nition that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems, right? That was\nthe basis for our discussion on feelings of inferiority.\nYOUTH: Yes, that’s correct. The subject of feelings of inferiority was too intense, and I was on\nthe verge of forgetting that point. Why did you bring up the subject in the \u0000rst place?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is connected with the subject of competition. Please remember that. If there\nis competition at the core of a person’s interpersonal relationships, he will not be able to\nescape interpersonal relationship problems or escape misfortune.\nYOUTH: Why not?\nPHILOSOPHER: Because at the end of a competition, there are winners and losers.\nYOUTH: It’s perfectly \u0000ne to have winners and losers!\nPHILOSOPHER: Give some thought to it, then, if it were you, speci\u0000cally, who had a\nconsciousness of being in competition with the people around you. In your relations with\nthem, you would have no choice but to be conscious of victory or defeat. Mr. A got into this\nfamous university, Mr. B found work at that big company, and Mr. C has hooked up with\nsuch a nice-looking woman—and you’ll compare yourself to them and think, This is all I’ve\ngot.\nYOUTH: Ha-ha. That’s pretty speci\u0000c.\nPHILOSOPHER: When one is conscious of competition and victory and defeat, it is inevitable\nthat feelings of inferiority will arise. Because one is constantly comparing oneself to others\nand thinking, I beat that person or I lost to that person. The inferiority complex and the\nsuperiority complex are extensions of that. Now, what kind of being do you think the other\nperson is to you, at that point?\n\f\nYOUTH: I don’t know—a rival, I guess?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, not a mere rival. Before you know it, you start to see each and every\nperson, everyone in the whole world, as your enemy.\nYOUTH: My enemy?\nPHILOSOPHER: You start to think that people are always looking down on you and treating\nyou with scorn, that they’re all enemies who must never be underestimated, who lie in wait\nfor any opening and attack at the drop of a hat. In short, that the world is a terrifying place.\nYOUTH: Enemies who must never be underestimated . . . That’s who I’m in competition\nwith?\nPHILOSOPHER: This is what is so terrifying about competition. Even if you’re not a loser, even\nif you’re someone who keeps on winning, if you are someone who has placed himself in\ncompetition, you will never have a moment’s peace. You don’t want to be a loser. And you\nalways have to keep on winning if you don’t want to be a loser. You can’t trust other people.\nThe reason so many people don’t really feel happy while they’re building up their success in\nthe eyes of society is that they are living in competition. Because to them, the world is a\nperilous place that is over\u0000owing with enemies.\nYOUTH: I suppose so, but . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: But do other people actually look at you so much? Are they really watching\nyou around the clock and lying in wait for the perfect moment to attack? It seems rather\nunlikely. A young friend of mine, when he was a teenager, used to spend a lot of time in front\nof the mirror arranging his hair. And once, when he was doing that, his grandmother said,\n“You’re the only one who’s worried how you look.” He says that it got a bit easier for him to\ndeal with life after that.\nYOUTH: Hey, that’s a dig at me, isn’t it? Sure, maybe I do see the people around me as\nenemies. I’m constantly in fear of being attacked, of the arrows that could come \u0000ying at me\nat any moment. I always think that I’m being watched by others, that I’m being subjected to\nharsh judgment, and that I’m going to be attacked. And it’s probably true that this is a self-\nconscious reaction, just like the mirror-obsessed teenager. The people of the world aren’t\npaying attention to me. Even if I were to go walking on my hands down the street, they’d take\nno notice! But I don’t know. Are you saying, after all, that my feeling of inferiority is\nsomething that I chose, that has some sort of goal? That just doesn’t make any sense to me.\nPHILOSOPHER: And why is that?\n\f\nYOUTH: I have a brother who is three years older than I am. He \u0000ts the classic image of the big\nbrother—he always does what our parents say, he excels in his studies and in sports, and he’s\nthe very picture of diligence. And from the time I was little, I was always compared to him.\nHe is older and more advanced, so of course I could never beat him at anything. Our parents\ndid not care at all about such circumstances, and never gave me any sign of recognition.\nWhatever I did, I got treated like a child, and I was berated at every opportunity and told to\nbe quiet. I learned to keep my feelings to myself. I’ve lived my life totally steeped in feelings of\ninferiority, and I had no choice but to be conscious of being in competition with my brother!\nPHILOSOPHER: I see.\nYOUTH: Sometimes I think of it like this: I’m like a gourd that grew without getting enough\nsun. So it is only natural that I’m all twisted up with feelings of inferiority. If there’s anyone\nwho could grow straight in such a situation, well, I’d love to meet him!\nPHILOSOPHER: I understand. I really do understand how you feel. Now, let’s look at\n“competition” while taking into consideration your relationship with your brother. If you\ndidn’t think with a competition orientation, with regard to your brother and your other\ninterpersonal relationships, how would people seem to you?\nYOUTH: Well, my brother is my brother, and I guess other people are another story.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, they should become more positive comrades.\nYOUTH: Comrades?\nPHILOSOPHER: Earlier, didn’t you say, “I can’t celebrate other people’s happiness with all my\nheart”? You think of interpersonal relationships as competition; you perceive other people’s\nhappiness as “my defeat,” and that is why you can’t celebrate it. However, once one is released\nfrom the schema of competition, the need to triumph over someone disappears. One is also\nreleased from the fear that says, Maybe I will lose. And one becomes able to celebrate other\npeople’s happiness with all one’s heart. One may become able to contribute actively to other\npeople’s happiness. The person who always has the will to help another in times of need—\nthat is someone who may properly be called your comrade.\nYOUTH: Hmm.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now we come to the important part. When you are able to truly feel that\n“people are my comrades,” your way of looking at the world will change utterly. No longer\nwill you think of the world as a perilous place, or be plagued by needless doubts; the world\nwill appear before you as a safe and pleasant place. And your interpersonal relationship\nproblems will decrease dramatically.\n\f\nYOUTH: What a happy person you are! But you know, that’s all like a sun\u0000ower. It’s the\nreasoning of a sun\u0000ower that is bathed in full sunshine every day and is nurtured with ample\nwatering. A gourd grown in the dim shade doesn’t do so well!\nPHILOSOPHER: You are returning to etiology (the attributing of causes) again.\nYOUTH: Oh, yes, I sure am!\nRaised by strict parents, the youth had been oppressed and compared to his elder\nbrother ever since childhood. None of his opinions were ever heard, and he was\nsubjected to the violent words that he was a poor excuse for a little brother. Unable to\nmake friends even at school, he spent all his free time alone in the library, which\nbecame his sole place of refuge. This youth who had passed his early years in such a\nway was truly an inhabitant of etiology. If he had not been raised by those parents, if\nthat elder brother had never existed, and if he had not attended that school, he could\nhave had a brighter life. The youth had been trying to participate in the discussion as\ncoolheadedly as possible, but now his many years of pent-up feelings came bursting\nout.\n\f\nFrom Power Struggle to Revenge\nYOUTH: Okay, all this talk about teleology and such is pure sophistry, and trauma de\u0000nitely\ndoes exist. And people cannot break free from the past. Surely you realize that? We cannot go\nback to the past in a time machine. As long as the past exists as the past, we live within\ncontexts from the past. If one were to treat the past as something that does not exist, that\nwould be the same as negating the entire life one has led. Are you suggesting I choose such an\nirresponsible life?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is true that one cannot use a time machine or turn back the hands of time.\nBut what kind of meaning does one attribute to past events? This is the task that is given to\n“you now.”\nYOUTH: All right, so let’s talk about “now.” Last time, you said that people fabricate the\nemotion of anger, right? And that that is the standpoint of teleology. I still cannot accept that\nstatement. For example, how would you explain instances of anger toward society, or anger\ntoward government? Would you say that these, too, are emotions fabricated in order to push\none’s opinions?\nPHILOSOPHER: Certainly, there are times when I feel indignation with regard to social\nproblems. But I would say that rather than a sudden burst of emotion, it is indignation based\non logic. There is a di\u0000erence between personal anger (personal grudge) and indignation with\nregard to society’s contradictions and injustices (righteous indignation). Personal anger soon\ncools. Righteous indignation, on the other hand, lasts for a long time. Anger as an expression\nof a personal grudge is nothing but a tool for making others submit to you.\nYOUTH: You say that personal grudges and righteous indignation are di\u0000erent?\nPHILOSOPHER: They are completely di\u0000erent. Because righteous indignation goes beyond\none’s own interests.\nYOUTH: Then I’ll ask about personal grudges. Surely even you get angry sometimes—for\ninstance, if someone hurls abuse at you for no particular reason—don’t you?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, I do not."

    "raw_text": "YOUTH: Come on, be honest.\nPHILOSOPHER: If someone were to abuse me to my face, I would think about the person’s\nhidden goal. Even if you are not directly abusive, when you feel genuinely angry due to\nanother person’s words or behavior, please consider that the person is challenging you to a\npower struggle.\nYOUTH: A power struggle?\nPHILOSOPHER: For instance, a child will tease an adult with various pranks and misbehaviors.\nIn many cases, this is done with the goal of getting attention and will cease just before the\nadult gets genuinely angry. However, if the child does not stop before the adult gets\ngenuinely angry, then his goal is actually to get in a \u0000ght.\nYOUTH: Why would he want to get in a \u0000ght?\nPHILOSOPHER: He wants to win. He wants to prove his power by winning.\nYOUTH: I don’t really get that. Could you give me some concrete examples?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s say you and a friend have been discussing the current political situation.\nBefore long, it turns into a heated argument, and neither of you is willing to accept any\ndi\u0000erences of opinion until \u0000nally it reaches the point where he starts engaging in personal\nattacks—that you’re stupid, and it’s because of people like you that this country doesn’t\nchange, that sort of thing.\nYOUTH: But if someone said that to me, I wouldn’t be able to put up with it.\nPHILOSOPHER: In this case, what is the other person’s goal? Is it only that he wants to discuss\npolitics? No, it isn’t. It’s that he \u0000nds you unbearable, and he wants to criticize and provoke\nyou, and make you submit through a power struggle. If you get angry at this point, the\nmoment he has been anticipating will arrive, and the relationship will suddenly turn into a\npower struggle. No matter what the provocation, you must not get taken in.\nYOUTH: No, there’s no need to run away from it. If someone wants to start a \u0000ght, it’s \u0000ne to\naccept it. Because it’s the other guy who’s at fault, anyway. You can bash his nose in, the\nstupid fool. With words, that is.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now let’s say you take control of the quarrel. And then the other man, who\nwas seeking to defeat you, withdraws in a sportsmanlike manner. The thing is, the power\nstruggle doesn’t end there. Having lost the dispute, he rushes on to the next stage.\n\f\nYOUTH: The next stage?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. It’s the revenge stage. Though he has withdrawn for the time being, he\nwill be scheming some revenge in another place and another form, and will reappear with an\nact of retaliation.\nYOUTH: Like what, for instance?\nPHILOSOPHER: The child oppressed by his parents will turn to delinquency. He’ll stop going\nto school. He’ll cut his wrists or engage in other acts of self-harm. In Freudian etiology, this is\nregarded as simple cause and e\u0000ect: The parents raised the child in this way, and that is why\nthe child grew up to be like this. It’s just like pointing out that a plant wasn’t watered, so it\nwithered. It’s an interpretation that is certainly easy to understand. But Adlerian teleology\ndoes not turn a blind eye to the goal that the child is hiding. That is to say, the goal of revenge\non the parents. If he becomes a delinquent, stops going to school, cuts his wrists, or things\nlike that, the parents will be upset. They’ll panic and worry themselves sick over him. It is in\nthe knowledge that this will happen that the child engages in problem behavior. So that the\ncurrent goal (revenge on the parents) can be realized, not because he is motivated by past\ncauses (home environment).\nYOUTH: He engages in problem behavior in order to upset his parents?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. There are probably a lot of people who feel mysti\u0000ed by seeing a\nchild who cuts his wrists, and they think, Why would he do such a thing? But try to think how\nthe people around the child—the parents, for instance—will feel as a result of the behavior of\nwrist cutting. If you do, the goal behind the behavior should come into view of its own\naccord.\nYOUTH: The goal being revenge?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. And once the interpersonal relationship reaches the revenge stage, it is\nalmost impossible for either party to \u0000nd a solution. To prevent this from happening, when\none is challenged to a power struggle, one must never allow oneself to be taken in.\n\f\nAdmitting Fault Is Not Defeat\nYOUTH: All right, then what should you do when you’re subjected to personal attacks right to\nyour face? Do you just grin and bear it?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, the idea that you are “bearing it” is proof that you are still stuck in the\npower struggle. When you are challenged to a \u0000ght, and you sense that it is a power struggle,\nstep down from the con\u0000ict as soon as possible. Do not answer his action with a reaction.\nThat is the only thing we can do.\nYOUTH: But is it really that easy to not respond to provocation? In the \u0000rst place, how would\nyou say I should control my anger?\nPHILOSOPHER: When you control your anger, you’re “bearing it,” right? Instead, let’s learn a\nway to settle things without using the emotion of anger. Because after all, anger is a tool. A\nmeans for achieving a goal.\nYOUTH: That’s a tough one.\nPHILOSOPHER: The \u0000rst thing that I want you to understand here is the fact that anger is a\nform of communication, and that communication is nevertheless possible without using\nanger. We can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for\nanger. If you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all\non its own.\nYOUTH: But what if they come at you with mistaken accusations, or make insulting\ncomments? I shouldn’t get angry even then?\nPHILOSOPHER: You don’t seem to understand yet. It’s not that you mustn’t get angry, but\nthat there is no need to rely on the tool of anger. Irascible people do not have short tempers—\nit is only that they do not know that there are e\u0000ective communication tools other than\nanger. That is why people end up saying things like “I just snapped” or, “He \u0000ew into a rage.”\nWe end up relying on anger to communicate.\nYOUTH: E\u0000ective communication tools other than anger . . .\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: We have language. We can communicate through language. Believe in the\npower of language and the language of logic.\nYOUTH: Certainly, if I did not believe in that, we wouldn’t be having this dialogue.\nPHILOSOPHER: One more thing about power struggles. In every instance, no matter how\nmuch you might think you are right, try not to criticize the other party on that basis. This is\nan interpersonal relationship trap that many people fall into.\nYOUTH: Why’s that?\nPHILOSOPHER: The moment one is convinced that “I am right” in an interpersonal\nrelationship, one has already stepped into a power struggle.\nYOUTH: Just because you think you’re right? No way, that’s just blowing things all out of\nproportion.\nPHILOSOPHER: I am right. That is to say, the other party is wrong. At that point, the focus of\nthe discussion shifts from “the rightness of the assertions” to “the state of the interpersonal\nrelationship.” In other words, the conviction that “I am right” leads to the assumption that\n“this person is wrong,” and \u0000nally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to win.\nIt’s a power struggle through and through.\nYOUTH: Hmm.\nPHILOSOPHER: In the \u0000rst place, the rightness of one’s assertions has nothing to do with\nwinning or losing. If you think you are right, regardless of what other people’s opinions\nmight be, the matter should be closed then and there. However, many people will rush into a\npower struggle and try to make others submit to them. And that is why they think of\n“admitting a mistake” as “admitting defeat.”\nYOUTH: Yes, there de\u0000nitely is that aspect.\nPHILOSOPHER: Because of one’s mind-set of not wanting to lose, one is unable to admit one’s\nmistake, the result being that one ends up choosing the wrong path. Admitting mistakes,\nconveying words of apology, and stepping down from power struggles—none of these things\nis defeat. The pursuit of superiority is not something that is carried out through competition\nwith other people.\nYOUTH: So when you’re hung up on winning and losing, you lose the ability to make the\nright choices?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. It clouds your judgment, and all you can see is imminent victory or\ndefeat. Then you turn down the wrong path. It’s only when we take away the lenses of\ncompetition and winning and losing that we can begin to correct and change ourselves.\n\f\nOvercoming the Tasks That Face You in Life\nYOUTH: Okay, but there’s still a problem. It’s the statement “All problems are interpersonal\nrelationship problems.” I can see that the feeling of inferiority is an interpersonal relationship\nworry, and that it has certain e\u0000ects on us. And I accept as logical the idea that life is not a\ncompetition. I cannot see other people as comrades, and somewhere inside me I think of\nthem as enemies. This is clearly the case. But the thing I \u0000nd puzzling is, why does Adler place\nso much importance on interpersonal relationships? Why does he go so far as to say “all” of\nthem?\nPHILOSOPHER: The issue of interpersonal relationships is so important that no matter how\nbroadly it is addressed, it never seems to su\u0000ce. Last time I told you, “What you are lacking is\nthe courage to be happy.” You remember that, right?\nYOUTH: I couldn’t forget it if I tried.\nPHILOSOPHER: So why do you see other people as enemies, and why can’t you think of them\nas your comrades? It is because you have lost your courage and you are running away from\nyour “life tasks.”\nYOUTH: My life tasks?\nPHILOSOPHER: Right. This is a crucial point. In Adlerian psychology, clear objectives are laid\nout for human behavior and psychology.\nYOUTH: What sort of objectives?\nPHILOSOPHER: First, there are two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in\nharmony with society. Then, the two objectives for the psychology that supports these\nbehaviors are the consciousness that I have the ability and the consciousness that people are\nmy comrades.\nYOUTH: Just a moment. I’m writing this down . . . There are the following two objectives for\nbehavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. And there are the following\ntwo objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviors: the consciousness that I have\nthe ability and the consciousness that people are my comrades . . . Okay, I can see that it is a"

    "raw_text": "crucial subject: to be self-reliant as an individual while living in harmony with people and\nsociety. It seems to tie in with everything we’ve been discussing.\nPHILOSOPHER: And these objectives can be achieved by facing what Adler calls “life tasks.”\nYOUTH: What are life tasks?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s think of the word “life” as tracing back to childhood. During childhood,\nwe are protected by our parents and can live without needing to work. But eventually, the\ntime comes when one has to be self-reliant. One cannot be dependent on one’s parents\nforever, and one has to be self-reliant mentally, of course, and self-reliant in a social sense as\nwell, and one has to engage in some form of work—which is not limited to the narrow\nde\u0000nition of working at a company. Furthermore, in the process of growing up, one begins to\nhave all kinds of friend relationships. Of course, one may form a love relationship with\nsomeone that may even lead to marriage. If it does, one will start a marital relationship, and if\none has children, a parent-child relationship will begin. Adler made three categories of the\ninterpersonal relationships that arise out of these processes. He referred to them as “tasks of\nwork,” “tasks of friendship,” and “tasks of love,” and all together as “life tasks.”\nYOUTH: Are these tasks the obligations one has as a member of society? In other words, things\nlike labor and payment of taxes?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, please think of this solely in terms of interpersonal relationships. That is,\nthe distance and depth in one’s interpersonal relationships. Adler sometimes used the\nexpression “three social ties” to emphasize the point.\nYOUTH: The distance and depth in one’s interpersonal relationships?\nPHILOSOPHER: The interpersonal relationships that a single individual has no choice but to\nconfront when attempting to live as a social being—these are the life tasks. They are indeed\ntasks in the sense that one has no choice but to confront them.\nYOUTH: Would you be more speci\u0000c?\nPHILOSOPHER: First, let’s look at the tasks of work. Regardless of the kind of work, there is no\nwork that can be completed all by oneself. For instance, I am usually here in my study writing\na manuscript. Writing is completely autonomous work that I cannot have someone else do\nfor me. But then there is the presence of the editor and many others, without whose\nassistance the work would not be realized, from the people who handle book design and\nprinting to the distribution and bookstore sta\u0000. Work that can be completed without the\ncooperation of other people is in principle unfeasible.\n\f\nYOUTH: Broadly speaking, I suppose so.\nPHILOSOPHER: However, considered from the viewpoint of distance and depth, interpersonal\nrelationships of work may be said to have the lowest hurdles. Interpersonal relationships of\nwork have the easy-to-understand common objective of obtaining good results, so people can\ncooperate even if they don’t always get along, and to some extent they have no choice but to\ncooperate. And as long as a relationship is formed solely on the basis of work, it will go back\nto being a relationship with an outsider when working hours are over or one changes jobs.\nYOUTH: Yes, so true.\nPHILOSOPHER: And the ones who get tripped up in the interpersonal relationships at this\nstage are the people referred to as “NEETs” (a young person not in education, employment,\nor training) or “shut-ins” (a person con\u0000ned indoors).\nYOUTH: Huh? Wait a minute! Are you saying that they don’t try to work simply because they\nwant to avoid the interpersonal relationships that are associated with work, not that they\ndon’t want to work or that they’re refusing to do manual labor?\nPHILOSOPHER: Putting aside the question of whether or not they are conscious of it\nthemselves, interpersonal relationships are at the core. For example, a man sends out résumés\nto \u0000nd work and gets interviews, only to be rejected by one company after another. It hurts\nhis pride. He starts to wonder what the purpose in working is if he has to go through such\nthings. Or he makes a big mistake at work. The company is going to lose a huge sum of\nmoney because of him. Feeling utterly hopeless, as if he’s plunged into darkness, he can’t bear\nthe thought of coming in to work the following day. None of these are examples of the work\nitself becoming disagreeable. What is disagreeable is being criticized or rebuked by others\nthrough the work, getting labeled as having no ability or being incompetent or unsuited to\nthe work, and hurting the dignity of one’s irreplaceable self. In other words, everything is an\ninterpersonal relationship issue."

    "raw_text": "Red String and Rigid Chains\nYOUTH: Well, I’ll save my objections for later. Next, what about the task of friendship?\nPHILOSOPHER: This is a friend relationship in a broader sense, away from work, as there is\nnone of the compulsion of the workplace. It is a relationship that is di\u0000cult to initiate or\ndeepen.\nYOUTH: Ah, you’ve got that right! If there’s a space, like one’s school or workplace, one can\nstill build a relationship. But then it would be a super\u0000cial relationship that is limited to that\nspace. To even attempt to initiate a personal friend relationship, or \u0000nd a friend in a place\noutside the school or workplace, would be extremely di\u0000cult.\nPHILOSOPHER: Do you have anyone whom you would call a close friend?\nYOUTH: I have a friend. But I’m not sure I’d call him a close friend . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: It used to be the same for me. When I was in high school, I did not even try to\nmake friends and spent my days studying Greek and German, quietly absorbed in reading\nphilosophy books. My mother was worried about me and went to consult my homeroom\nteacher. And my teacher told her, “There’s no need to worry. He’s a person who doesn’t need\nfriends.” Those words were very encouraging to my mother, and to me as well.\nYOUTH: A person who doesn’t need friends? So in high school you didn’t have a single\nfriend?\nPHILOSOPHER: I did have one friend. He said, “There’s nothing really worth learning at a\nuniversity,” and in the end he actually did not enter university. He went into seclusion up in\nthe mountains for several years, and these days I hear he’s working in journalism in Southeast\nAsia. I haven’t seen him in decades, but I have the feeling that if we got together again, we’d\nbe able to hang out just as we did back then. A lot of people think that the more friends you\nhave the better, but I’m not so sure about that. There’s no value at all in the number of\nfriends or acquaintances you have. And this is a subject that connects with the task of love,\nbut what we should be thinking about is the distance and depth of the relationship.\nYOUTH: Will it be possible for me to make close friends?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course it will. If you change, those around you will change too. They will\nhave no choice but to change. Adlerian psychology is a psychology for changing oneself, not a\npsychology for changing others. Instead of waiting for others to change or waiting for the\nsituation to change, you take the \u0000rst step forward yourself.\nYOUTH: Hmm . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: The fact is that you came like this to visit me in my room. And, in you, I have\nfound a young friend.\nYOUTH: I am your friend?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, because you are. The dialogue going on here is not counseling, and we do\nnot have a work relationship. To me, you are an irreplaceable friend. Don’t you think so?\nYOUTH: I’m your . . . irreplaceable friend? No, I won’t think anything about that right now.\nLet’s just keep going. What about the last one, the task of love?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think of it as divided into two stages: one, what are known as love\nrelationships; and two, relationships with family, in particular parent-child relationships. We\nhave discussed work and friendship, but of the three tasks, most likely it is the task of love\nthat is the most di\u0000cult. When a friend relationship has turned into love, speech and\nconduct that were permitted between friends may no longer be permitted the moment they\nbecome lovers. Speci\u0000cally, that would mean not permitting socializing with friends of the\nopposite sex, and in some cases just speaking on the telephone to someone of the opposite sex\nis enough to arouse jealousy. The distance is that close, and the relationship that deep.\nYOUTH: Yes, I suppose it can’t be helped.\nPHILOSOPHER: But Adler does not accept restricting one’s partner. If the person seems to be\nhappy, one can frankly celebrate that condition. That is love. Relationships in which people\nrestrict each other eventually fall apart.\nYOUTH: Wait, that’s an argument that can only lead to a\u0000rming in\u0000delity. Because if one’s\npartner were happily having an a\u0000air, you’re saying that one should celebrate even that.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, I am not a\u0000rming someone having an a\u0000air. Think about it this way:\nThe kind of relationship that feels somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are\ntogether cannot be called love, even if there is passion. When one can think, Whenever I am\nwith this person, I can behave very freely, one can really feel love. One can be in a calm and\nquite natural state, without having feelings of inferiority or being beset with the need to\n\u0000aunt one’s superiority. That is what real love is like. Restriction, on the other hand, is a"

    "raw_text": "manifestation of the mind-set of attempting to control one’s partner, and also an idea\nfounded on a sense of distrust. Being in the same space with someone who distrusts you isn’t\na natural situation that one can put up with, is it? As Adler says, “If two people want to live\ntogether on good terms, they must treat each other as equal personalities.”\nYOUTH: Okay.\nPHILOSOPHER: However, in love relationships and marital relationships, there is the option of\nseparating. So even a husband and wife who have been together for many years can separate if\ncontinuing the relationship becomes distressful. In a parent-child relationship, however, in\nprinciple this cannot be done. If romantic love is a relationship connected by red string, then\nthe relationship between parents and children is bound in rigid chains. And a pair of small\nscissors is all you have. This is the di\u0000culty of the parent-child relationship.\nYOUTH: So what can one do?\nPHILOSOPHER: What I can say at this stage is: You must not run away. No matter how\ndistressful the relationship, you must not avoid or put o\u0000 dealing with it. Even if in the end\nyou’re going to cut it with scissors, \u0000rst you have to face it. The worst thing to do is to just\nstand still with the situation as it is. It is fundamentally impossible for a person to live life\ncompletely alone, and it is only in social contexts that the person becomes an “individual.”\nThat is why in Adlerian psychology, self-reliance as an individual and cooperation within\nsociety are put forth as overarching objectives. Then, how can one achieve these objectives?\nOn this point, Adler speaks of surmounting the three tasks of work, friendship, and love, the\ntasks of the interpersonal relationships that a living person has no choice but to confront.\nThe youth was still struggling to grasp their true meaning.\n\f\nDon’t Fall for the “Life-Lie”\nYOUTH: Ah, it’s getting confusing again. You said that I see other people as enemies and can’t\nthink of them as comrades because I’m running away from my life tasks. What was that\nsupposed to mean, anyway?\nPHILOSOPHER: Suppose, for instance, that there is a certain Mr. A whom you don’t like\nbecause he has some \u0000aws that are hard to forgive.\nYOUTH: Ha-ha, if we’re looking for people I don’t like, there’s no shortage of candidates.\nPHILOSOPHER: But it isn’t that you dislike Mr. A because you can’t forgive his \u0000aws. You had\nthe goal of taking a dislike to Mr. A beforehand and then started looking for the \u0000aws to\nsatisfy that goal.\nYOUTH: That’s ridiculous! Why would I do that?\nPHILOSOPHER: So that you could avoid an interpersonal relationship with Mr. A.\nYOUTH: No way, that’s completely out of the question. It’s obvious that the order of things is\nbackward. He did something I didn’t like, that’s why. If he hadn’t, I’d have no reason for\ntaking a dislike to him.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, you are wrong. It’s easy to see if you think back on the example of\nseparating from a person whom one has been in a love relationship with. In relationships\nbetween lovers or married couples, there are times when, after a certain point, one becomes\nexasperated with everything one’s partner says or does. For instance, she doesn’t care for the\nway he eats; his slovenly appearance at home \u0000lls her with revulsion, and even his snoring sets\nher o\u0000. Even though until a few months ago, none of it had ever bothered her before.\nYOUTH: Yes, that sounds familiar.\nPHILOSOPHER: The person feels this way because at some stage she has resolved to herself, I\nwant to end this relationship, and she has been looking around for the material with which to\nend it. The other person hasn’t changed at all. It is her own goal that has changed. Look,\npeople are extremely sel\u0000sh creatures who are capable of \u0000nding any number of \u0000aws and"

    "raw_text": "shortcomings in others whenever the mood strikes them. A man of perfect character could\ncome along, and one would have no di\u0000culty in digging up some reason to dislike him.\nThat’s exactly why the world can become a perilous place at any time, and it’s always possible\nto see everyone as one’s enemies.\nYOUTH: So I am making up \u0000aws in other people just so that I can avoid my life tasks, and\nfurther more, so I can avoid interpersonal relationships? And I am running away by thinking\nof other people as my enemies?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Adler called the state of coming up with all manner of pretexts in\norder to avoid the life tasks the “life-lie.”\nYOUTH: Okay . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it’s a severe term. One shifts one’s responsibility for the situation one is\ncurrently in to someone else. One is running away from one’s life tasks by saying that\neverything is the fault of other people, or the fault of one’s environment. It’s exactly the same\nas with the story I mentioned earlier about the female student with the fear of blushing. One\nlies to oneself, and one lies to the people around one, too. When you really think about it, it’s\na pretty severe term.\nYOUTH: But how can you conclude that I am lying? You don’t know anything about what\nkind of people I have around me, or what kind of life I lead, do you?\nPHILOSOPHER: True, I don’t know anything about your past. Not about your parents, or\nyour elder brother either. I know only one thing.\nYOUTH: What’s that?\nPHILOSOPHER: The fact that you—and no one else—are the one who decided your lifestyle.\nYOUTH: Argh!\nPHILOSOPHER: If your lifestyle were determined by other people or your environment, it\nwould certainly be possible to shift responsibility. But we choose our lifestyles ourselves. It’s\nclear where the responsibility lies.\nYOUTH: So you’re out to condemn me. But you’re calling people liars and cowards. And\nsaying that everyone is my responsibility.\nPHILOSOPHER: You must not use the power of anger to look away. This is a very important\npoint. Adler never discusses the life tasks or life-lies in terms of good and evil. It is not morals\n\f\nor good and evil that we should be discussing, but the issue of courage.\nYOUTH: Courage again!\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Even if you are avoiding your life tasks and clinging to your life-lies, it isn’t\nbecause you are steeped in evil. It is not an issue to be condemned from a moralistic\nstandpoint. It is only an issue of courage.\n\f\nFrom the Psychology of Possession to the\nPsychology of Practice\nYOUTH: So in the end what you’re talking about is courage? That reminds me, last time you\nsaid that Adlerian psychology is a “psychology of courage.”\nPHILOSOPHER: I will add to that by saying that Adlerian psychology is not a “psychology of\npossession” but a “psychology of use.”\nYOUTH: So it’s that statement: “It’s not what one is born with but what use one makes of that\nequipment.”\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Thank you for remembering it. Freudian etiology is a psychology\nof possession, and eventually it arrives at determinism. Adlerian psychology, on the other\nhand, is a psychology of use, and it is you who decides it.\nYOUTH: Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage, and at the same time it is a\npsychology of use . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: We humans are not so fragile as to simply be at the mercy of etiological (cause-\nand-e\u0000ect) traumas. From the standpoint of teleology, we choose our lives and our lifestyles\nourselves. We have the power to do that.\nYOUTH: But, honestly, I do not have the con\u0000dence to overcome my inferiority complex. And\nyou might say that that’s a life-lie, but I probably won’t ever be able to break free from the\ninferiority complex.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why don’t you think so?\nYOUTH: Maybe what you are saying is right. Actually, I’m sure it is, and courage really is what\nI am lacking. I can accept the life-lie as well. I am scared of interacting with people. I don’t\nwant to get hurt in interpersonal relationships, and I want to put o\u0000 my life tasks. That’s why\nI have all these excuses ready. Yes, it’s exactly as you say. But isn’t what you are talking about a\nkind of spiritualism? All you’re really saying is, “You’ve lost your courage, you’ve got to pluck\nup your courage.” It’s no di\u0000erent from the silly instructor who thinks he’s giving you advice"

Next time, we will probably discuss freedom.\nYOUTH: Not courage?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it will be a discussion of freedom, which is essential when talking about\ncourage. Please give some thought to the matter of what freedom is.\nYOUTH: What freedom is . . . Fine. I am looking forward to next time."

    "raw_text": "THE THIRD NIGHT:\nDiscard Other People’s Tasks\n\f\nTwo anguished weeks later, the youth paid another visit to the philosopher’s study. What is\nfreedom? Why can’t people be free? Why can’t I be free? What is the true nature of whatever it\nis that is constraining me? The assignment he had been given was weighing heavily on him,\nbut it seemed impossible to \u0000nd a convincing answer. The more he thought about it, the\nmore the youth began to notice his own lack of freedom.\n\f\nDeny the Desire for Recognition\nYOUTH: So you said that today we would discuss freedom.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Did you have any time to think about what freedom is?\nYOUTH: Yes, actually. I thought about it at great length.\nPHILOSOPHER: And did you arrive at any conclusions?\nYOUTH: Well, I couldn’t \u0000nd any answers. But I did \u0000nd this—it’s not my own idea, but\nsomething I came across at the library, a line from a novel by Dostoevsky: “Money is coined\nfreedom.” What do you think? Isn’t “coined freedom” a rather refreshing term? But seriously,\nI was fascinated to \u0000nd this one line that drove right to the heart of this thing called money.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. Certainly, if one were to speak in a very general sense of the true nature\nof that which is brought about by money, one might say that is freedom. It is an astute\nobservation, to be sure. But you wouldn’t go so far as to say that “freedom therefore is\nmoney,” would you?\nYOUTH: It’s exactly as you say. There probably is freedom that can be gained by way of\nmoney. And I’m sure that freedom is greater than we imagine. Because, in reality, all the\nnecessities of life are dealt with through \u0000nancial transactions. Does it follow, then, that if\none possesses great wealth, one can be free? I don’t believe that is the case; I would certainly\nlike to believe that it is not the case, and that human values and human happiness cannot be\nbought with money.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, say for the moment that you have obtained \u0000nancial freedom. And then,\nthough you have gained great wealth, you have not found happiness. At that time, what\nproblems and privations would remain for you?\nYOUTH: It would be the interpersonal relationships you have been mentioning. I have\nthought deeply about this matter. For instance, you might be blessed by great wealth but not\nhave anyone who loves you; you have no comrades whom you could call friends, and you are\nnot liked by anyone. This is a great misfortune. Another thing I can’t get out of my head is\nthe word “bonds.” Every one of us is tangled up and writhing in these strings that we call\n\f\nbonds. Having to be attached to a person you don’t even care for, for example, or to always\nwatch out for your awful boss’s mood swings. Imagine, if you could be released from such\npetty interpersonal relationships, how easy things would be! But no one can really do such a\nthing. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by other people, and we are social individuals,\nwho exist in our relations to other people. No matter what we do, we cannot escape the\nstrong rope of our interpersonal relationships. I see now that Adler’s statement “All problems\nare interpersonal relationship problems” is a great insight.\nPHILOSOPHER: It is a crucial point. Let’s dig a little deeper. What is it about our interpersonal\nrelationships that is robbing us of our freedom?\nYOUTH: Last time, you spoke about whether one thinks of other people as enemies or as\ncomrades. You said that if one becomes able to see others as one’s comrades, one’s way of\nlooking at the world should change as well. That certainly makes sense. I felt quite convinced\nthe other day when I left here. But then what happened? I gave the matter some careful\nthought, and I noticed that there are aspects of interpersonal relationships that can’t be\ncompletely explained.\nPHILOSOPHER: Like what?\nYOUTH: The most obvious one is the existence of parents. I could never think of parents as\nenemies. During my childhood, especially, they were my greatest guardians who raised and\nprotected me. In that regard, I am sincerely grateful. Still, my parents were strict people. I told\nyou about this last time, that they always compared me to my older brother and refused to\nrecognize me. And they have constantly made comments about my life, saying I should study\nmore, not make friends with people like this or that, get into this university at the very least,\nget this kind of job, and so on. Their demands put a lot of pressure on me and were certainly\nbonds.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then, what did you end up doing?\nYOUTH: It seems to me that until I started university, I was never able to ignore my parents’\nintentions. I was anxious, which was unpleasant, but the fact of the matter is that my wishes\nalways seemed to end up overlapping with my parents’. My place of work I chose myself,\nhowever.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now that you mention it, I haven’t heard about that yet. What kind of work\ndo you do?\nYOUTH: I’m now working as a librarian at a university library. My parents wanted me to take\non my father’s printing plant, like my brother did. Because of this, ever since I started my\n\f\ncurrent job, our relationship has been somewhat strained. If they weren’t my parents, and\ninstead were enemy-like presences in my life, I probably wouldn’t have minded at all. Because\nno matter how much they might have tried to interfere, I could always just ignore them. But\nas I’ve said, parents to me are not enemies. Whether or not they are comrades is another\nmatter, but, at the very least, they are not what I would call enemies. It’s a relationship that is\nmuch too close to be able to just ignore their intentions.\nPHILOSOPHER: When you decided which university you would go to in line with your\nparents’ wishes, what sort of emotion did you feel with regard to your parents?\nYOUTH: It’s complicated. I did have feelings of resentment, but on the other hand there was\nthis sense of relief, too. You know, that I could get them to recognize me if I went to that\nschool.\nPHILOSOPHER: You could get them to recognize you?\nYOUTH: Come on, let’s stop the roundabout leading questions. I’m sure you know what I’m\nreferring to. It’s the so-called desire for recognition. It’s interpersonal relationship problems\nin a nutshell. We human beings live in constant need of recognition from others. It is\nprecisely because the other person is not an abhorrent enemy that one wants recognition\nfrom him, isn’t it? So yes, that’s right; I wanted to be recognized by my parents.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. Let’s talk about one of the major premises of Adlerian psychology\nregarding this matter. Adlerian psychology denies the need to seek recognition from others.\nYOUTH: It denies the desire for recognition?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no need to be recognized by others. Actually, one must not seek\nrecognition. This point cannot be overstated.\nYOUTH: No way! Isn’t desire for recognition a truly universal desire that motivates all human\nbeings?\n\f\nDo Not Live to Satisfy the Expectations of Others\nPHILOSOPHER: Being recognized by others is certainly something to be happy about. But it\nwould be wrong to say that being recognized is absolutely necessary. For what does one seek\nrecognition in the \u0000rst place? Or, to put it more succinctly, why does one want to be praised\nby others?\nYOUTH: It’s simple. It’s through being recognized by others that each of us can truly feel we\nhave value. It is through recognition from others that one becomes able to wipe away one’s\nfeelings of inferiority. One learns to have con\u0000dence in oneself. Yes, it’s an issue of value. I\nthink you mentioned it last time: that the feeling of inferiority is an issue of value judgment.\nIt’s because I could never get recognition from my parents that I have lived a life tainted by\nfeelings of inferiority.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now let’s consider a familiar setting. For example, let’s say you’ve been\npicking up litter around your workplace. The thing is, no one seems to notice at all. Or if\nthey do, no one has given you any appreciation for what you’ve done, or even said a single\nword of thanks. Well, will you keep on picking up litter from now on?\nYOUTH: That’s a di\u0000cult situation. I suppose that if no one appreciates what I’m doing, I\nmight stop.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why?\nYOUTH: Picking up litter is for everyone. If I’m rolling up my sleeves and getting it done, but I\ndon’t get a word of thanks? I guess I’d probably lose my motivation.\nPHILOSOPHER: This is the danger of the desire for recognition. Why is it that people seek\nrecognition from others? In many cases, it is due to the in\u0000uence of reward-and-punishment\neducation.\nYOUTH: Reward-and-punishment education?\nPHILOSOPHER: If one takes appropriate action, one receives praise. If one takes inappropriate\naction, one receives punishment. Adler was very critical of education by reward and\npunishment. It leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise\n\f\nme, I won’t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I’ll engage in\ninappropriate actions, too. You already have the goal of wanting to be praised when you start\npicking up litter. And if you aren’t praised by anyone, you’ll either be indignant or decide\nthat you’ll never do such a thing again. Clearly, there’s something wrong with this situation.\nYOUTH: No! I wish you wouldn’t trivialize things. I’m not arguing about education. Wanting\nto be recognized by people you like, to be accepted by people close to you, is a normal desire.\nPHILOSOPHER: You are badly mistaken. Look, we are not living to satisfy other people’s\nexpectations.\nYOUTH: What do you mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: You are not living to satisfy other people’s expectations, and neither am I. It is\nnot necessary to satisfy other people’s expectations.\nYOUTH: That is such a self-serving argument! Are you saying one should think only about\noneself and live self-righteously?\nPHILOSOPHER: In the teachings of Judaism, one \u0000nds a view that goes something like this: If\nyou are not living your life for yourself, then who is going to live it for you? You are living\nonly your own life. When it comes to who you are living it for, of course it’s you. And then, if\nyou are not living your life for yourself, who could there be to live it instead of you?\nUltimately, we live thinking about “I.” There is no reason that we must not think that way.\nYOUTH: So you are a\u0000icted by the poison of nihilism, after all. You say that, ultimately, we\nlive thinking about “I”? And that that’s okay? What a wretched way of thinking!\nPHILOSOPHER: It is not nihilism at all. Rather, it’s the opposite. When one seeks recognition\nfrom others, and concerns oneself only with how one is judged by others, in the end, one is\nliving other people’s lives.\nYOUTH: What does that mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: Wishing so hard to be recognized will lead to a life of following expectations\nheld by other people who want you to be “this kind of person.” In other words, you throw\naway who you really are and live other people’s lives. And please remember this: If you are\nnot living to satisfy other people’s expectations, it follows that other people are not living to\nsatisfy your expectations. Someone might not act the way you want him to, but it doesn’t do\nto get angry. That’s only natural."

    "raw_text": "YOUTH: No, it is not! That is an argument that overturns our society from its very\nfoundation. Look, we have the desire for recognition. But in order to receive recognition\nfrom others, \u0000rst we have to recognize others ourselves. It is because one recognizes other\npeople and other systems of values that one is recognized by others. It is through this\nrelationship of mutual recognition that our very society is built. Your argument is an\nabhorrent, dangerous way of thinking, which will drive human beings into isolation and lead\nto con\u0000ict. It’s a diabolical solicitation to needlessly stir up distrust and doubt.\nPHILOSOPHER: Ha-ha, you certainly have an interesting vocabulary. There’s no need to raise\nyour voice—let’s think about this together. One has to get recognition, or one will su\u0000er. If\none doesn’t get recognition from others and from one’s parents, one won’t have con\u0000dence.\nCan such a life be healthy? So one could think, God is watching, so accumulate good deeds. But\nthat and the nihilist view that “there is no God, so all evil deeds are permitted” are two sides\nof the same coin. Even supposing that God did not exist, and that we could not gain\nrecognition from God, we would still have to live this life. Indeed, it is in order to overcome\nthe nihilism of a godless world that it is necessary to deny recognition from other people.\nYOUTH: I don’t care for all this talk about God. Think more straightforwardly and more\nplainly about the mentality of real, everyday people. What about the desire to be recognized\nsocially, for example? Why does a person want to climb the corporate ladder? Why does a\nperson seek status and fame? It’s the wish to be recognized as somebody important by society\nas a whole—it’s the desire for recognition.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then, if you get that recognition, would you say that you’ve really found\nhappiness? Do people who have established their social status truly feel happy?\nYOUTH: No, but that’s . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: When trying to be recognized by others, almost all people treat satisfying\nother people’s expectations as the means to that end. And that is in accordance with the\nstream of thought of reward-and-punishment education that says one will be praised if one\ntakes appropriate action. If, for example, the main point of your job turns out to be satisfying\nother people’s expectations, then that job is going to be very hard on you. Because you’ll\nalways be worried about other people looking at you and fear their judgment, and you are\nrepressing your “I-ness.” It might come as a surprise to you, but almost none of my clients\nwho come for counseling are sel\u0000sh people. Rather, they are su\u0000ering trying to meet the\nexpectations of other people, the expectations of their parents and teachers. So, in a good\nway, they can’t behave in a self-centered fashion.\nYOUTH: So I should be sel\u0000sh?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Do not behave without regard for others. To understand this, it is necessary to\nunderstand the idea in Adlerian psychology known as “separation of tasks.”\nYOUTH: Separation of tasks? That’s a new term. Let’s hear about it.\nThe youth’s irritation had reached its peak. Deny the desire for recognition? Don’t\nsatisfy other people’s expectations? Live in a more self-centered way? What on earth was\nthis philosopher saying? Isn’t the desire for recognition itself people’s greatest\nmotivator for associating with each other and going about the formation of society?\nThe youth wondered, What if this “separation of tasks” idea doesn’t win me over? I\nwon’t be able to accept this man, or Adler for that matter, for the rest of my life."

    "raw_text": "How to Separate Tasks\nPHILOSOPHER: Say there’s a child who has a hard time studying. He doesn’t pay attention in\nclass, doesn’t do his homework, and even leaves his books at school. Now, what would you do\nif you were his father?\nYOUTH: Well, of course, I would try everything I could think of to get him to apply himself.\nI’d hire tutors and make him go to a study center, even if I had to pull him by the ear to get\nhim there. I’d say that’s a parent’s duty. And that’s actually how I was raised myself. I wasn’t\nallowed to eat dinner until the day’s homework was done.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then let me ask another question. Did you learn to enjoy studying as a result\nof being made to do it in such a heavy-handed manner?\nYOUTH: Unfortunately, I did not. I just took care of my studies for school and for exams in a\nroutine way.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. All right, I will talk about this from the basic stance of Adlerian\npsychology. When one is confronted with the task of studying, for instance, in Adlerian\npsychology we consider it from the perspective of “Whose task is this?”\nYOUTH: Whose task?\nPHILOSOPHER: Whether the child studies or not. Whether he goes out and plays with his\nfriends or not. Essentially this is the child’s task, not the parent’s task.\nYOUTH: Do you mean that it is something the child is supposed to do?\nPHILOSOPHER: Simply put, yes. There would be no point if the parents studied instead of the\nchild, would there?\nYOUTH: Well, no, there wouldn’t.\nPHILOSOPHER: Studying is the child’s task. A parent’s handling of that by commanding the\nchild to study is, in e\u0000ect, an act of intruding on another person’s task. One is unlikely to\n\f\navert a collision in this way. We need to think with the perspective of “Whose task is this?”\nand continually separate one’s own tasks from other people’s tasks.\nYOUTH: How does one go about separating them?\nPHILOSOPHER: One does not intrude on other people’s tasks. That’s all.\nYOUTH: That’s all?\nPHILOSOPHER: In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on\nother people’s tasks, or having one’s own tasks intruded on. Carrying out the separation of\ntasks is enough to change one’s interpersonal relationships dramatically.\nYOUTH: Hmm. I don’t really get it. In the \u0000rst place, how can you tell whose task it is? From\nmy point of view, realistically speaking, getting one’s child to study is the duty of the parents.\nBecause almost no child studies just out of enjoyment, and after all is said and done, the\nparent is the child’s guardian.\nPHILOSOPHER: There is a simple way to tell whose task it is. Think, Who ultimately is going to\nreceive the result brought about by the choice that is made? When the child has made the choice\nof not studying, ultimately, the result of that decision—not being able to keep up in class or\nto get into the preferred school, for instance—does not have to be received by the parents.\nClearly, it is the child who has to receive it. In other words, studying is the child’s task.\nYOUTH: No, no. You’re completely wrong! The parent, who is more experienced in life and\nalso acts as a guardian, has the responsibility to urge the child to study so such situations do\nnot arise. This is something done for the good of the child and is not an act of intruding.\nWhile studying may be the child’s task, getting the child to study is the parent’s task.\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s true that one often hears parents today using the phrase “It’s for your own\ngood.” But they are clearly doing so in order to ful\u0000ll their own goals, which could be their\nappearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for\nexample. In other words, it is not “for your own good” but for the parents’. And it is because\nthe child senses this deception that he rebels.\nYOUTH: So even if the child hasn’t been studying at all, you’re saying that, since it’s his task, I\nshould just let him be?\nPHILOSOPHER: One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend the\nnoninterference approach. Noninterference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even\nbeing interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child\nis doing that one protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is\n\f\nhis task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to\nstudy. But one must not intrude on the child’s task. When no requests are being made, it\ndoes not do to meddle in things.\nYOUTH: Does this go beyond parent-child relationships?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course. In Adlerian psychology counseling, for instance, we do not\nthink of the client’s changing or not changing as the task of the counselor.\nYOUTH: What are you saying here?\nPHILOSOPHER: As a result of having received counseling, what kind of resolution does the\nclient make? To change his lifestyle, or not. This is the client’s task, and the counselor cannot\nintervene.\nYOUTH: No way, I can’t accept such an irresponsible attitude!\nPHILOSOPHER: Naturally, one gives all the assistance one possibly can. But beyond that, one\ndoesn’t intrude. Remember the old saying, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t\nmake him drink.” Please think of counseling and all other assistance provided to other people\nin Adlerian psychology as having that kind of stance. Forcing change while ignoring the\nperson’s intentions will only lead to an intense reaction.\nYOUTH: The counselor does not change the client’s life?\nPHILOSOPHER: You are the only one who can change yourself."

    "raw_text": "Discard Other People’s Tasks\nYOUTH: Then, what about with shut-ins, for example? I mean, with someone like my friend.\nEven then, would you say it’s the separation of tasks, don’t intervene, and it has no\nconnection to the parents?\nPHILOSOPHER: Can he break out of the shut-in situation or not? Or, in what way can he\nbreak out of it? In principle, this is a task that the person has to resolve himself. It is not for\nthe parents to intervene. Nevertheless, as they are not complete strangers, some form of\nassistance is probably needed. At this point, the most important thing is whether the child\nfeels he can consult frankly with his parents when he is experiencing a dilemma, and whether\nthey have been building enough of a trust relationship on a regular basis.\nYOUTH: Then, suppose your own child had shut himself in, what would you do? Please\nanswer this not as a philosopher but as a parent.\nPHILOSOPHER: First, I myself would think, This is the child’s task. I would try not to intervene\nin his shut-in situation, and I would refrain from focusing too much attention on it. Then I\nwould send a message to him to the e\u0000ect that I am ready to assist him whenever he is in\nneed. In that way, the child, having sensed a change in his parent, will have no choice but to\nmake it his own task to think about what he should do. He’ll probably come and ask for\nassistance, and he’ll probably try to work some things out on his own.\nYOUTH: Could you really manage to be so cut and dried if it were your own child who’d\nbecome a shut-in?\nPHILOSOPHER: A parent su\u0000ering over the relationship with his or her child will tend to\nthink, My child is my life. In other words, the parent is taking on the child’s task as his or her\nown and is no longer able to think about anything but the child. When at last the parent\nnotices it, the “I” is already gone from his or her life. However, no matter how much of the\nburden of the child’s task one carries, the child is still an independent individual. Children do\nnot become what their parents want them to become. In their choices of university, place of\nemployment, and partner in marriage, and even in the everyday subtleties of speech and\nconduct, they do not act according to their parents’ wishes. Naturally, the parents will worry\nabout them, and probably want to intervene at times. But, as I said earlier, other people are\n\f\nnot living to satisfy your expectations. Though the child is one’s own, he or she is not living\nto satisfy one’s expectations as a parent.\nYOUTH: So you have to draw the line even with family?\nPHILOSOPHER: Actually, with families there is less distance, so it’s all the more necessary to\nconsciously separate the tasks.\nYOUTH: That doesn’t make sense. On the one hand, you’re talking about love, and on the\nother, you’re denying it. If you draw the line between yourself and other people that way, you\nwon’t be able to believe in anyone anymore!\nPHILOSOPHER: Look, the act of believing is also the separation of tasks. You believe in your\npartner; that is your task. But how that person acts with regard to your expectations and trust\nis other people’s tasks. When you push your wishes without having drawn that line, before\nyou know it you’re engaging in stalker-like intervention. Suppose your partner did not act as\nyou had wished. Would you still be able to believe in that person? Would you still be able to\nlove that person? The task of love that Adler speaks of is composed of such questions.\nYOUTH: That’s di\u0000cult! That’s very di\u0000cult.\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course it is. But think about it this way: Intervening in other people’s tasks\nand taking on other people’s tasks turns one’s life into something heavy and full of hardship.\nIf you are leading a life of worry and su\u0000ering—which stems from interpersonal relationships\n—learn the boundary of “From here on, that is not my task.” And discard other people’s\ntasks. That is the \u0000rst step toward lightening the load and making life simpler."

    "raw_text": "How to Rid Yourself of Interpersonal\nRelationship Problems\nYOUTH: I don’t know, it just doesn’t sit right with me.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then let’s envision a scene in which your parents are vehemently opposing\nyour choice of place of employment. They were in fact against it, weren’t they?\nYOUTH: Yes, they were. I wouldn’t go so far as saying they were vehemently opposed, but they\ndid make various snide remarks.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, let’s exaggerate it and say they were vehemently opposed. Your father\nwas ranting and raving with emotion, and your mother was protesting your decision with\ntears in her eyes. They absolutely do not approve of you becoming a librarian, and if you will\nnot take on the family business like your brother has, they may very well disown you. But\nhow to come to terms with the emotion of “not approving” is your parents’ task, not yours.\nIt is not a problem for you to worry about.\nYOUTH: Now wait a minute. Are you saying that it doesn’t matter how sad I make my parents\nfeel?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. It doesn’t matter.\nYOUTH: You’ve got to be joking! Could there be such a thing as a philosophy that\nrecommends un\u0000lial behavior?\nPHILOSOPHER: All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best path that you\nbelieve in. On the other hand, what kind of judgment do other people pass on that choice?\nThat is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do anything about.\nYOUTH: What another person thinks of you—if he or she likes you or dislikes you—that is\nthat person’s task, not mine. Is that what you are saying?\nPHILOSOPHER: That is what separating is. You are worried about other people looking at you.\nYou are worried about being judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving\n\f\nrecognition from others. Now, why are you worried about other people looking at you,\nanyway? Adlerian psychology has an easy answer. You haven’t done the separation of tasks\nyet. You assume that even things that should be other people’s tasks are your own. Remember\nthe words of the grandmother: “You’re the only one who’s worried how you look.” Her\nremark drives right to the heart of the separation of tasks. What other people think when they\nsee your face—that is the task of other people and is not something you have any control\nover.\nYOUTH: As theory, I get it. To my reasoning brain, it does make sense. But my emotions can’t\nkeep up with such a high-handed argument.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then let’s try another tack. Say there’s a man who’s distressed about the\ninterpersonal relationships at the company where he works. He has a completely irrational\nboss who yells at him at every opportunity. No matter how hard he tries, his boss doesn’t\nacknowledge his e\u0000orts and never even really listens to what he says.\nYOUTH: That sounds exactly like my boss.\nPHILOSOPHER: But is being acknowledged by your boss “work” that you should think of as\ntop priority? It isn’t your job to be liked by people at the place you work. Your boss doesn’t\nlike you. And his reasons for not liking you are clearly unreasonable. But in that case, there’s\nno need for you to get cozy with him.\nYOUTH: That sounds right, but the person is my boss, right? I won’t get any work done if I’m\nshunned by my direct superior.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is Adler’s life-lie again. I can’t do my work because I’ve been shunned by\nmy boss. It’s the boss’s fault that my work isn’t going well. The person who says such things\nis bringing up the existence of the boss as an excuse for the work that doesn’t go well. Much\nlike the female student with the fear of blushing, it’s actually that you need the existence of an\nawful boss. Because then you can say, “If only I didn’t have this boss, I could get more work\ndone.”\nYOUTH: No, you don’t know my relationship with my boss! I wish you would stop making\narbitrary guesses.\nPHILOSOPHER: This is a discussion that is concerned with the fundamentals of Adlerian\npsychology. If you are angry, nothing will sink in. You think, I’ve got that boss, so I can’t work.\nThis is complete etiology. But it’s really, I don’t want to work, so I’ll create an awful boss, or I\ndon’t want to acknowledge my incapable self, so I’ll create an awful boss. That would be the\nteleological way of looking at it.\n\f\nYOUTH: That’s probably how it’d be framed in your stock teleology approach. But in my case,\nit’s di\u0000erent.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then suppose you had done the separation of tasks. How would things be? In\nother words, no matter how much your boss tries to vent his unreasonable anger at you, that\nis not your task. The unreasonable emotions are tasks for your boss to deal with himself.\nThere is no need to cozy up to him, or to yield to him to the point of bowing down. You\nshould think, What I should do is face my own tasks in my own life without lying.\nYOUTH: But that’s . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: We are all su\u0000ering in interpersonal relationships. It might be the relationship\nwith one’s parents or one’s elder brother, and it might be the interpersonal relationships at\none’s workplace. Now, last time, you were saying that you wanted some speci\u0000c steps. This is\nwhat I propose. First, one should ask, “Whose task is this?” Then do the separation of tasks.\nCalmly delineate up to what point one’s own tasks go, and from what point they become\nanother person’s tasks. And do not intervene in other people’s tasks, or allow even a single\nperson to intervene in one’s own tasks. This is a speci\u0000c and revolutionary viewpoint that is\nunique to Adlerian psychology and contains the potential to utterly change one’s\ninterpersonal relationship problems.\nYOUTH: Aha. I am starting to see what you meant when you said that the topic of today’s\ndiscussion was freedom.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. We are trying to talk about freedom now.\n\f\nCut the Gordian Knot\nYOUTH: I am sure that if one could understand the separation of tasks and put it into\npractice, one’s interpersonal relationships would all at once become free. But I still can’t\naccept it.\nPHILOSOPHER: Go on. I’m listening.\nYOUTH: I think that, in theory, the separation of tasks is entirely right. What other people\nthink of me, or what sort of judgment they pass on me, is the task of other people, and is not\nsomething I can do anything about. And I should just do what I have to do in my life\nwithout lying. I’d have no problem if you said this is a life truth—that’s how right I think it\nis. But consider this: From an ethical or moral point of view, could it be said to be the right\nthing to do? That is to say, a way of living that draws boundaries between oneself and others.\nBecause wouldn’t you be brushing other people away and saying, “That’s intervention!”\nwhenever they were worried about you and asked how you’re doing? It seems to me that this\nis something that treads on the goodwill of others.\nPHILOSOPHER: Have you heard of Alexander the Great?\nYOUTH: Alexander the Great? Yes, I learned about him in world history.\nPHILOSOPHER: He was a Macedonian king who lived in the fourth century before Christ.\nWhen he was advancing on the Persian kingdom of Lydia, he learned of a chariot enshrined\nin the acropolis. The chariot had been secured tightly to a pillar in the temple by Gordias, the\nformer king, and there was a local legend that said, “He who unravels this knot shall be\nmaster of Asia.” It was a tightly wound knot that many men of skill had been certain they\ncould unbind, but no one had succeeded. Now, what do you think Alexander the Great did\nwhen he stood before this knot?\nYOUTH: Well, didn’t he unravel the legendary knot with ease, and go on to become the ruler\nof Asia?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, that’s not how it happened. As soon as Alexander the Great saw how\ntight the knot was, he pulled out his sword and sliced it in half with one stroke."

    "raw_text": "YOUTH: Wow!\nPHILOSOPHER: Then, it is said that he declared, “Destiny is not something brought about by\nlegend, but by clearing away with one’s own sword.” He had no use for the power of legend\nand would forge his destiny with his sword. As you know, he then proceeded to become the\ngreat conqueror of all the territories of what is now the Middle East and western Asia. This is\nthe famous anecdote known as the Gordian knot. And so, such intricate knots—the bonds in\nour interpersonal relationships—are not to be unraveled by conventional methods but must\nbe severed by some completely new approach. Whenever I explain the separation of tasks, I\nalways remember the Gordian knot.\nYOUTH: Well, I don’t mean to contradict you, but not everyone can become Alexander the\nGreat. Isn’t it precisely because there was no one else who could have cut the knot that the\nanecdote portraying it as a heroic deed is still conveyed to this day? It’s exactly the same with\nthe separation of tasks. Even though one knows one can just cut through something with\none’s sword, one might \u0000nd it rather di\u0000cult. Because when one presses forward with the\nseparation of tasks, in the end one will have to cut ties with people. One will drive people into\nisolation. The separation of tasks you speak of completely ignores human emotion! How\ncould one possibly build good interpersonal relationships with that?\nPHILOSOPHER: One can build them. The separation of tasks is not the objective for\ninterpersonal relationships. Rather, it is the gateway.\nYOUTH: The gateway?\nPHILOSOPHER: For instance, when reading a book, if one brings one’s face too close to it, one\ncannot see anything. In the same way, forming good interpersonal relationships requires a\ncertain degree of distance. When the distance gets too small and people become stuck\ntogether, it becomes impossible to even speak to each other. But the distance must not be too\ngreat, either. Parents who scold their children too much become mentally very distant. When\nthis happens, the child can no longer even consult the parents, and the parents can no longer\ngive the proper assistance. One should be ready to lend a hand when needed but not\nencroach on the person’s territory. It is important to maintain this kind of moderate distance.\nYOUTH: Is distance necessary even in the kind of relationship that parents and children have?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. Earlier you said that the separation of tasks is something that treads\non the other person’s goodwill. That is a notion that is tied to reward. It’s the idea that when\nanother person does something for you, you have to do something in return—even if that\nperson does not want anything. Rather than responding to the goodwill, it is just being tied\n\f\nto reward. No matter what sort of appeal the other person might make, you are the only one\nwho decides what you should do.\nYOUTH: Reward is at the root of what I am calling “ties”?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. When reward is at the base of an interpersonal relationship, there’s a\nfeeling that wells up in one that says, “I gave this much, so you should give me that much\nback.” This is a notion that is quite di\u0000erent from separation of tasks, of course. We must not\nseek reward, and we must not be tied to it.\nYOUTH: Hmm.\nPHILOSOPHER: However, there are certainly situations in which it would be easier to\nintervene in the tasks of another person without doing any separation of tasks—for instance,\nin a child-raising situation, when a child is having a hard time tying his shoes. For the busy\nmother, it is certainly faster to tie them than to wait for him to do it himself. But that is an\nintervention, and it is taking the child’s task away from him. And as a result of repeating that\nintervention, the child will cease to learn anything, and will lose the courage to face his life\ntasks. As Adler says, “Children who have not been taught to confront challenges will try to\navoid all challenges.”\nYOUTH: But that is such a dry way of thinking.\nPHILOSOPHER: When Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, there were probably those\nwho felt the same way: that the unraveling of the knot by hand had meaning, and that it was\na mistake to cut it with a sword; that Alexander had misunderstood the meaning of the\noracle’s words. In Adlerian psychology, there are aspects that are antithetical to normal social\nthinking. It denies etiology, denies trauma, and adopts teleology. It treats people’s problems\nas interpersonal relationship problems. And the not-seeking of recognition and the\nseparation of tasks, too, are probably antithetical to normal social thinking.\nYOUTH: It’s impossible! I can’t do it!\nPHILOSOPHER: Why?\nThe youth was devastated by the separation of tasks that the philosopher had begun\ndescribing. When one thought of all one’s problems as being in one’s interpersonal\nrelationships, the separation of tasks was e\u0000ective. Just by having this viewpoint, the\nworld would become quite simple. But there was no \u0000esh and blood in it. It gave o\u0000"

    "raw_text": "Desire for Recognition Makes You Unfree\nYOUTH: Look, I have been dissatis\u0000ed for ages. The adults of the world tell the young people,\n“Do something you like to do.” And they say it with smiles on their faces as if they might\nactually be understanding people, as if they were on the side of the young. But it’s all lip\nservice, which comes out only because those young people are complete strangers to them,\nand the relationship is one that is completely without any kind of responsibility. Then\nparents and teachers tell us, “Get into that school,” or “Look for a stable occupation,” and\nthis concrete and uninteresting instruction is not merely an intervention. It’s actually that\nthey are trying to ful\u0000ll their responsibilities. It’s precisely because we are closely connected to\nthem and they are seriously concerned about our future that they can’t say irresponsible\nthings like, “Do something you like.” I’m sure you’d put on that understanding face too, and\nsay to me, “Please do something you like.” But I won’t believe such a comment from another\nperson! It’s an extremely irresponsible comment, as if one were just brushing a caterpillar o\u0000\none’s shoulder. And if the world crushed that caterpillar, you would say, “It’s not my task,”\nand walk away nonchalantly. What separation of tasks, you monster!\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh, goodness, you’re getting all bent out of shape. So what you are saying, in\nother words, is that you want someone to intervene to some extent? That you want another\nperson to decide your path?\nYOUTH: Sure, maybe I do! It’s like this: It’s not so di\u0000cult to judge what others expect of one,\nor what kind of role is being demanded of one. Living as one likes, on the other hand, is\nextremely di\u0000cult. What does one want? What does one want to become, and what kind of\nlife does one want to lead? One doesn’t always get such a concrete idea of things. It would be\na grave mistake to think that everyone has clear-cut dreams and objectives. Don’t you know\nthat?\nPHILOSOPHER: Maybe it is easier to live in such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations.\nBecause one is entrusting one’s own life to them. For example, one runs along the tracks that\none’s parents have laid out. Even if there are a lot of things one might object to, one will not\nlose one’s way as long as one stays on those rails. But if one is deciding one’s path oneself, it’s\nonly natural that one will get lost at times. One comes up against the wall of “how one\nshould live.”\n\f\nYOUTH: That is why I am looking for recognition from others. You were talking about God\nearlier, and if we were still living in an era when God was something people believed in, I\nsuppose that “God is watching” might serve as a criterion for self-discipline. If one were\nrecognized by God, maybe one didn’t need recognition from others. But that era ended a\nlong time ago. And, in that case, one has no choice but to discipline oneself on the basis that\nother people are watching. To aspire to be recognized by others and live an honest life. Other\npeople’s eyes are my guide.\nPHILOSOPHER: Does one choose recognition from others, or does one choose a path of\nfreedom without recognition? It’s an important question—let’s think about it together. To\nlive one’s life trying to gauge other people’s feelings and being worried about how they look\nat you. To live in such a way that others’ wishes are granted. There may indeed be signposts to\nguide you this way, but it is a very unfree way to live. Now, why are you choosing such an\nunfree way to live? You are using the term “desire for recognition,” but what you are really\nsaying is that you don’t want to be disliked by anyone.\nYOUTH: Who does? There’s no one anywhere who’d go so far as to actually want to be\ndisliked.\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. It is true that there is no person who wishes to be disliked. But look at\nit this way: What should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: It is\nto constantly gauge other people’s feelings while swearing loyalty to all of them. If there are\nten people, one must swear loyalty to all ten. When one does that, for the time being one will\nhave succeeded in not being disliked by anyone. But at this point, there is a great\ncontradiction looming. One swears loyalty to all ten people out of the single-minded desire to\nnot be disliked. This is like a politician who has fallen into populism and begun to make\nimpossible promises and accept responsibilities that are beyond him. Naturally, his lies will\ncome to light before long. He will lose people’s trust and turn his own life into one of greater\nsu\u0000ering. And, of course, the stress of continual lying has all kinds of consequences. Please\ngrasp this point. If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, and\none is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to\noneself and continuing that lying to include the people around one.\nYOUTH: So one should be egocentric and live however one pleases?\nPHILOSOPHER: Separating one’s tasks is not an egocentric thing. Intervening in other people’s\ntasks is essentially an egocentric way of thinking, however. Parents force their children to\nstudy; they meddle in their life and marriage choices. That is nothing other than an\negocentric way of thinking.\nYOUTH: So the child can just ignore his parents’ intentions and live however he pleases?"

Not only are you a nihilist, you’re an anarchist and a hedonist to boot. I’m\npast being astonished, and now I’m going to start laughing any moment.\nPHILOSOPHER: An adult, who has chosen an unfree way to live, on seeing a young person\nliving freely here and now in this moment, criticizes the youth as being hedonistic. Of course,\nthis is a life-lie that comes out so that the adult can accept his own unfree life. An adult who\nhas chosen real freedom himself will not make such comments and will instead cheer on the\nwill to be free.\nYOUTH: All right, so what you are maintaining is that freedom is the issue? Let’s get to the\nmain point. You’ve been using the word “freedom” a lot, but what does freedom mean to\nyou, anyway? How can we be free?\n\f\nWhat Real Freedom Is\nPHILOSOPHER: Earlier, you acknowledged that you do not want to be disliked by anyone, and\nsaid, “There’s no one anywhere who’d go so far as to actually want to be disliked.”\nYOUTH: Right.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, I’m the same way. I have no desire to be disliked by other people. I\nwould say that “No one would go so far as to actually want to be disliked” is a sharp insight.\nYOUTH: It’s a universal desire!\nPHILOSOPHER: Even so, regardless of our e\u0000orts, there are people who dislike me and people\nwho dislike you. This, too, is a fact. When you are disliked, or feel that you are being disliked,\nby someone, what state of mind does it put you in?\nYOUTH: Very distressed, to put it simply. I wonder why I’ve come to be disliked, and what I\ndid or said that might have been o\u0000ensive. I think I should have interacted with the person in\na di\u0000erent way, and I just brood and brood over it and am ridden with guilt.\nPHILOSOPHER: Not wanting to be disliked by other people. To human beings, this is an\nentirely natural desire, and an impulse. Kant, the giant of modern philosophy, called this\ndesire “inclination.”\nYOUTH: Inclination?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it is one’s instinctive desires, one’s impulsive desires. Now, if one were to\nsay that living like a stone tumbling downhill and allowing such inclinations or desires or\nimpulses to take one wherever they will is “freedom,” one would be incorrect. To live in such\na way is only to be a slave to one’s desires and impulses. Real freedom is an attitude akin to\npushing up one’s tumbling self from below.\nYOUTH: Pushing oneself up from below?\nPHILOSOPHER: A stone is powerless. Once it has begun to roll downhill, it will continue to\nroll until released from the natural laws of gravity and inertia. But we are not stones. We are"

    "raw_text": "beings who are capable of resisting inclination. We can stop our tumbling selves and climb\nuphill. The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire. So are you going to keep rolling\ndownhill in order to receive recognition from others? Are you going to wear yourself down\nlike a rolling stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left is a little round\nball, would that be “the real I”? It cannot be.\nYOUTH: Are you saying that resisting one’s instincts and impulses is freedom?\nPHILOSOPHER: As I have stated repeatedly, in Adlerian psychology, we think that all problems\nare interpersonal relationship problems. In other words, we seek release from interpersonal\nrelationships. We seek to be free from interpersonal relationships. However, it is absolutely\nimpossible to live all alone in the universe. In light of what we have discussed until now, the\nconclusion we reach regarding “What is freedom?” should be clear.\nYOUTH: What is it?\nPHILOSOPHER: In short, that “freedom is being disliked by other people.”\nYOUTH: Huh? What was that?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your\nfreedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own\nprinciples.\nYOUTH: But, but . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: It is certainly distressful to be disliked. If possible, one would like to live\nwithout being disliked by anyone. One wants to satisfy one’s desire for recognition. But\nconducting oneself in such a way as to not be disliked by anyone is an extremely unfree way\nof living, and is also impossible. There is a cost incurred when one wants to exercise one’s\nfreedom. And the cost of freedom in interpersonal relationships is that one is disliked by\nother people.\nYOUTH: No! That’s totally wrong. There is no way that could be called freedom. That’s a\ndiabolical way of thinking to coax one into evildoing.\nPHILOSOPHER: You’ve probably been thinking of freedom as “release from organizations.”\nThat breaking away from your home or school, your company or your nation is freedom.\nHowever, if you were to break away from your organization, for instance, you would not be\nable to gain real freedom. Unless one is unconcerned by other people’s judgments, has no fear\nof being disliked by other people, and pays the cost that one might never be recognized, one\n\f\nwill never be able to follow through in one’s own way of living. That is to say, one will not be\nable to be free.\nYOUTH: Be disliked by other people—is that what you are saying?\nPHILOSOPHER: What I am saying is, don’t be afraid of being disliked.\nYOUTH: But that’s—\nPHILOSOPHER: I am not telling you to go so far as to live in such a way that you will be\ndisliked, and I am not saying engage in wrongdoing. Please do not misunderstand that.\nYOUTH: No. Then let’s change the question. Can people actually endure the weight of\nfreedom? Are people that strong? To not care even if one is disliked by one’s own parents—\ncan one become so self-righteously de\u0000ant?\nPHILOSOPHER: One neither prepares to be self-righteous nor becomes de\u0000ant. One just\nseparates tasks. There may be a person who does not think well of you, but that is not your\ntask. And again, thinking things like He should like me or I’ve done all this, so it’s strange that\nhe doesn’t like me, is the reward-oriented way of thinking of having intervened in another\nperson’s tasks. One moves forward without fearing the possibility of being disliked. One does\nnot live as if one were rolling downhill, but instead climbs the slope that lies ahead. That is\nfreedom for a human being. Suppose that I had two choices in front of me—a life in which\nall people like me, and a life in which there are people who dislike me—and I was told to\nchoose one. I would choose the latter without a second thought. Before being concerned\nwith what others think of me, I want to follow through with my own being. That is to say, I\nwant to live in freedom.\nYOUTH: Are you free, now?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. I am free.\nYOUTH: You do not want to be disliked, but you don’t mind if you are?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, that’s right. Not wanting to be disliked is probably my task, but whether\nor not so-and-so dislikes me is the other person’s task. Even if there is a person who doesn’t\nthink well of me, I cannot intervene in that. To borrow from the proverb I mentioned earlier,\nnaturally one would make the e\u0000ort to lead someone to water, but whether he drinks or not\nis that person’s task.\nYOUTH: That’s some conclusion."

When you\nhave gained that courage, your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things\nof lightness.\n\f\nYou Hold the Cards to Interpersonal\nRelationships\nYOUTH: Well, I never would have imagined I’d visit a philosopher’s place to hear about being\ndisliked.\nPHILOSOPHER: I am well aware that this is not an easy thing to swallow. It will probably take\nsome time to chew over and digest. If we go any further with this today, I think you won’t be\nable to keep it in your head. So I would like to talk to you about one more thing, a personal\nmatter that relates to the separation of tasks, and then \u0000nish up for today.\nYOUTH: All right.\nPHILOSOPHER: This one, too, is about relationships with parents. My relationship with my\nfather had always been a rocky one, even when I was a child. My mother died when I was in\nmy twenties, without us ever engaging in anything like real conversation together, and after\nthat my relationship with my father became increasingly strained. That is, until I encountered\nAdlerian psychology and grasped Adler’s ideas.\nYOUTH: Why did you have a bad relationship with your father?\nPHILOSOPHER: What I have in my memory is an image from a time when he hit me. I have no\nrecollection of what I might have done to bring it on. I only remember hiding under a desk in\nan attempt to escape him, when he dragged me out and hit me hard. And not just once, but\nmany times.\nYOUTH: That fear became a trauma . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: I think that until I encountered Adlerian psychology, I understood it in that\nkind of way. Because my father was a moody, taciturn person. But to think to myself, He hit\nme that time, and that is why our relationship went bad, is a Freudian etiological way of\nthinking. The Adlerian teleology position completely reverses the cause-and-e\u0000ect\ninterpretation. That is to say, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don’t want my\nrelationship with my father to get better.\n\f\nYOUTH: So \u0000rst you had the goal of not wanting your relationship with your father to get\nbetter and not wanting to repair things between you.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. For me, it was more convenient to not repair my relationship\nwith my father. I could use having a father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn’t\ngoing well. That for me was a virtue. And there was also the aspect of taking revenge on a\nfeudal father.\nYOUTH: That is exactly what I wanted to ask about! Even if the cause and e\u0000ect were reversed,\nthat is to say, in your case, you were able to analyze yourself and say, “It isn’t because he hit\nme that I have a bad relationship with my father, but that I brought out the memory of being\nhit because I don’t want my relationship with my father to get better,” even then, how does it\nactually change things? It doesn’t change the fact that you were hit in childhood, right?\nPHILOSOPHER: One can think from the viewpoint that it is an interpersonal relationship card.\nAs long as I use etiology to think, It is because he hit me that I have a bad relationship with my\nfather, it would be a matter that was impossible for me to do anything about. But if I can\nthink, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don’t want my relationship with my\nfather to get better, then I will be holding the card to repair relations. Because if I can just\nchange the goal, that \u0000xes everything.\nYOUTH: Does that really \u0000x things?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course.\nYOUTH: I wonder if you really feel so from the bottom of your heart. I can understand it in\ntheory, but the feeling just doesn’t sit right with me.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then it’s the separation of tasks. It’s true that my father and I had a\ncomplicated relationship. He was a stubborn person, and I could never imagine his feelings\nbeing able to change easily. Moreover, there was a strong possibility that he had even\nforgotten ever raising his hands against me. However, at the time of making my resolution to\nrepair relations, it did not matter to me what sort of lifestyle my father had, or what he\nthought of me, or the kind of attitude he might adopt in response to my approach—such\nthings didn’t matter at all. Even if there were no intention to repair relations on his side, I\nwould not mind in the least. The issue was whether or not I would resolve to do it, and I was\nalways holding the interpersonal relationship cards.\nYOUTH: You were always holding the interpersonal relationship cards?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Many people think that the interpersonal relationship cards are held by\nthe other person. That is why they wonder, How does that person feel about me? and end up"

I do not\nknow what will happen to the other person as a result, and that is not an aspect I can take\npart in. This too is the separation of tasks. Of course, there are times when, in tandem with\nmy change—not due to my change—the other person changes too. In many cases, that person\nwill have no choice but to change. But that is not the goal, and it is certainly possible that the\nother person will not change. In any case, changing one’s own speech and conduct as a way of\nmanipulating other people is clearly a mistaken way of thinking.\nYOUTH: One must not manipulate other people, and manipulating cannot be done.\nPHILOSOPHER: When we speak of interpersonal relationships, it always seems to be two-\nperson relationships and one’s relationship to a large group that come to mind, but \u0000rst it is\noneself. When one is tied to the desire for recognition, the interpersonal relationship cards\nwill always stay in the hands of other people. Does one entrust the cards of life to another\nperson, or hold onto them oneself? Please take your time and sort through these ideas again\nin your own home, about the separation of tasks and about freedom. I will be waiting for you\nhere, next time.\nYOUTH: All right. I will give it some thought on my own.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, then . . .\nYOUTH: Please, there is just one more thing I want to ask you.\nPHILOSOPHER: What is it?\nYOUTH: In the end, were you able to repair your relationship with your father?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course. I think so. My father fell ill, and in the last few years of his life,\nit was necessary for me and my family to take care of him. Then one day, when I was taking\ncare of him as usual, my father said, “Thank you.” I had not known my father possessed such\na word in his vocabulary, and I was astonished and felt grateful for all the days that had\npassed. Through the long years of my caregiving life, I had tried to do whatever I could, that\nis to say, I had done my best to lead my father to water. And in the end, he drank. I think he\ndid.\n\f\nYOUTH: Well, thank you very much. I will come again at the same time.\nPHILOSOPHER: I had a good time. Thank you, too."

    "raw_text": "THE FOURTH NIGHT:\nWhere the Center of the World Is\n\f\nThat was close—I almost fell for it! The following week, the young man called on the\nphilosopher again, and, with an indignant expression, knocked on the door.\nThe idea of separating tasks is certainly a useful one. You had me completely convinced last\ntime. But it seems like such a lonely way to live. Separating the tasks and lightening the load of\none’s interpersonal relations is just the same as cutting one’s connection to other people. And, to\ntop it oﬀ, you’re telling me to be disliked by other people? If that’s what you call freedom, then I’ll\nchoose not to be free!\n\f\nIndividual Psychology and Holism\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, you’re looking rather gloomy today.\nYOUTH: You see, since we last met, I’ve been thinking calmly and carefully about the\nseparation of tasks, and about freedom. I waited until my emotions had settled and then\napplied my reasoning mind. But the separation of tasks just doesn’t seem realistic.\nPHILOSOPHER: Hmm, okay. Please go on.\nYOUTH: Separating tasks is basically an idea that boils down to de\u0000ning a boundary and\nsaying, “I am I, and you are you.” Sure, there are probably fewer interpersonal relationship\nproblems that way. But would you really say that such a way of life is right? To me, it just\nseems like an extremely self-centered, misguided individualism. On my \u0000rst visit here, you\ntold me that Adlerian psychology is formally referred to as “individual psychology.” That\nterm had been bothering me for quite a while, but I \u0000nally \u0000gured out why: What you’re\ncalling Adlerian psychology, or individual psychology, is essentially the study of an\nindividualism that leads people into isolation.\nPHILOSOPHER: It is true that the term “individual psychology,” which Adler coined, has\ncertain aspects that may invite misunderstanding. I will explain what I mean now. First of all,\netymologically speaking, the word “individual” has the meaning “indivisible.”\nYOUTH: Indivisible?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. In other words, it is the smallest possible unit and therefore cannot be\nbroken down any further. Now, what is it exactly that cannot be divided? Adler was opposed\nto any kind of dualistic value system that treated the mind as separate from the body—reason\nas separate from emotion, or the conscious mind as separate from the unconscious mind.\nYOUTH: What’s the point of that?\nPHILOSOPHER: For example, do you remember the story about the female student who came\nto me for counseling on account of her fear of blushing? Why did she develop that fear of\nblushing? In Adlerian psychology, physical symptoms are not regarded separately from the\nmind (psyche). The mind and body are viewed as one, as a whole that cannot be divided into\n\f\nparts. Tension in the mind can make one’s arms and legs shake, or cause one’s cheeks to turn\nred, and fear can make one’s face turn white. And so on.\nYOUTH: Well, sure, there are parts of the mind and body that are connected.\nPHILOSOPHER: The same holds true for reason and emotion, and the conscious mind and the\nunconscious mind as well. A normally coolheaded person doesn’t expect to have a \u0000t of\nviolent emotion and start shouting at someone. We are not struck by emotions that somehow\nexist independently from us. Each of us is a uni\u0000ed whole.\nYOUTH: No, that is not true. It is precisely because we have the ability to view mind and body,\nreason and emotion, and the conscious and the unconscious mind as clearly separate from\neach other that we can gain a correct understanding of people. Isn’t that a given?\nPHILOSOPHER: Certainly it is true that the mind and the body are separate things, that reason\nand emotion are di\u0000erent, and that both the conscious mind and the unconscious mind exist.\nThat said, however, when one \u0000ies into a rage and shouts at another person, it is “I as a\nwhole” who is choosing to shout. One would never think of emotions that somehow exist\nindependently—unrelated to one’s intentions, as it were—as having produced that shouting\nvoice. When one separates the “I” from “emotion” and thinks, It was the emotion that made\nme do it, or The emotion got the best of me, and I couldn’t help it, such thinking quickly\nbecomes a life-lie.\nYOUTH: You’re referring to the time I yelled at that waiter, aren’t you?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. This view of the human being as “I as a whole,” as an indivisible being\nthat cannot be broken down into parts, is referred to as “holism.”\nYOUTH: Well, that’s \u0000ne. But I wasn’t asking you for an academic theory to provide a\nde\u0000nition of “individual.” Look, if you take Adlerian psychology to its logical conclusion, it’s\nbasically saying, “I am I, and you are you,” and leading people toward isolation. It’s saying, “I\nwon’t interfere with you, so don’t interfere with me either, and we’ll both go on living\nhowever we please.” Please tell me straightforwardly what your awareness is of that point.\nPHILOSOPHER: All right. All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. You have an\nunderstanding of this basic tenet of Adlerian psychology, correct?\nYOUTH: Yes, I do. The idea of noninterference in interpersonal relations, that is to say, the\nseparation of tasks, probably came about as a way to resolve those problems.\nPHILOSOPHER: This is something I believe I went over last time—that forming good\ninterpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. At the same time, people\n\f\nwho get too close end up not even being able to speak to each other, so it is not good to get\ntoo far apart, either. Please do not think of the separation of tasks as something that is meant\nto keep other people away; instead, see it as a way of thinking with which to unravel the\nthreads of the complex entanglement of one’s interpersonal relations.\nYOUTH: To unravel the threads?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Right now, your threads and other people’s threads are all tangled up\nin a confused mess, and you are looking at the world while in that condition. Red, blue,\nbrown, and green—all the colors mixing together—you think of it as “connection.” But it is\nnot.\nYOUTH: So, then, what do you think connection is?\nPHILOSOPHER: Last time, I spoke of the separation of tasks as a prescription for resolving\ninterpersonal relationship problems. But interpersonal relationships are not something that\nend just because one has separated the tasks. The separating of tasks is actually the point of\ndeparture for interpersonal relations. Today, let’s take the discussion deeper and address how\ninterpersonal relations as a whole are viewed in Adlerian psychology, and consider the kind of\nrelationships we should form with others."

    "raw_text": "The Goal of Interpersonal Relationships Is a\nFeeling of Community\nYOUTH: Okay, I have a question. Please give me a simple answer that gets straight to the heart\nof the matter. You said that the separating of tasks is the point of departure for interpersonal\nrelations. Well, what is the goal of interpersonal relations?\nPHILOSOPHER: To get straight to the heart of the matter, it is “community feeling.”\nYOUTH: . . . Community feeling?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. This is a key concept in Adlerian psychology, and views on its application\nhave been the subject of much debate. In fact, Adler’s proposal of the concept of community\nfeeling drove many people to part ways with him.\nYOUTH: Well, it sounds fascinating to me. What is this concept?\nPHILOSOPHER: It was the time before last, I believe, that I brought up the matter of how one\nsees others, that is, as enemies or as comrades. Now, take that a step deeper. If other people\nare our comrades, and we live surrounded by them, we should be able to \u0000nd in that life our\nown place of “refuge.” Moreover, in doing so, we should begin to have the desire to share\nwith our comrades, to contribute to the community. This sense of others as comrades, this\nawareness of “having one’s own refuge,” is called “community feeling.”\nYOUTH: But what part of this is open to debate? It seems like a completely irrefutable point.\nPHILOSOPHER: The issue is community. What does it consist of? When you hear the word\n“community,” what images come to mind?\nYOUTH: There are such frameworks as one’s household, school, workplace, or local society.\nPHILOSOPHER: When Adler refers to community, he goes beyond the household, school,\nworkplace, and local society, and treats it as all-inclusive, covering not only nations and all of\nhumanity but also the entire axis of time from the past to the future—and he includes plants\nand animals and even inanimate objects.\n\f\nYOUTH: Huh?\nPHILOSOPHER: In other words, he is espousing that community is not merely one of the\npreexisting frameworks that the word might bring to mind but is also inclusive of literally\neverything—the entire universe, from the past to the future.\nYOUTH: No way. Now you’ve lost me. The universe? Past and future? What on earth are you\ntalking about?\nPHILOSOPHER: The majority of those who hear this have similar doubts. This is not\nsomething one can comprehend immediately. Adler himself acknowledged that the\ncommunity he was espousing was “an unattainable ideal.”\nYOUTH: Ha-ha. Well, that’s perplexing, isn’t it? How about the other way around, then? Do\nyou really comprehend and accept this community feeling, or whatever it is, that includes the\nentire universe?\nPHILOSOPHER: I try to. Because I feel that one cannot truly comprehend Adlerian psychology\nwithout comprehending this point.\nYOUTH: Okay then!\nPHILOSOPHER: As I have been saying all along, Adlerian psychology has the view that all\nproblems are interpersonal relationship problems. Interpersonal relations are the source of\nunhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too—interpersonal relations are the source of\nhappiness.\nYOUTH: Indeed.\nPHILOSOPHER: Furthermore, community feeling is the most important index for considering\na state of interpersonal relations that is happy.\nYOUTH: All right. I’d like to hear all about it.\nPHILOSOPHER: Community feeling is also referred to as “social interest,” that is to say,\n“interest in society.” So now I have a question for you: Do you know what society’s smallest\nunit is, from the point of view of sociology?\nYOUTH: Society’s smallest unit, huh? I’d say the family.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, it is “you and I.” When there are two people, society emerges in their\npresence, and community emerges there too. To gain an understanding of the community\nfeeling that Adler speaks of, it is advisable to use “you and I” as the starting point.\n\f\nYOUTH: And what do you do with that as the starting point?\nPHILOSOPHER: You make the switch from attachment to self (self-interest) to concern for\nothers (social interest).\nYOUTH: Attachment to self? Concern for others? What’s all that about?\n\f\nWhy Am I Only Interested in Myself?\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, let’s consider this concretely. For purposes of clarity, in place of\n“attachment to self” I will use the word “self-centered.” In your view, someone who is self-\ncentered is what sort of person?\nYOUTH: Hmm, I guess the \u0000rst thing that comes to mind is the kind of person who’s like a\ntyrant. Someone who’s domineering, has no qualms about being a nuisance to others, and\nthinks only about things that are to his own advantage. He thinks that the world revolves\naround him, and he behaves like a dictator who rules by absolute authority and force. He’s\nthe kind of person who creates an enormous amount of trouble for everyone around him.\nSomeone who’s just like Shakespeare’s King Lear, a typical tyrant.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see.\nYOUTH: On the other hand, he wouldn’t necessarily be a tyrant—one might speak of the sort\nof person who disturbs the harmony of a group as self-centered, too. He’s someone who can’t\noperate in a group and prefers to act alone. He never stops to re\u0000ect on his actions, even\nwhen he’s late for appointments or fails to keep his promises. In a word, he is an egotist.\nPHILOSOPHER: To be sure, that is the kind of image that generally comes to mind when\nthinking of self-centered people. But there is another type that must be taken into account.\nPeople who are incapable of carrying out the separation of tasks and who are obsessed with\nthe desire for recognition are also extremely self-centered.\nYOUTH: Why is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Consider the reality of the desire for recognition. How much do others pay\nattention to you, and what is their judgment of you? That is to say, how much do they satisfy\nyour desire? People who are obsessed with such a desire for recognition will seem to be\nlooking at other people, while they are actually looking only at themselves. They lack concern\nfor others and are concerned solely with the “I.” Simply put, they are self-centered.\nYOUTH: So would you say that people like me, who fear being judged by others, are self-\ncentered, too? Even though I try so hard to be mindful of others and adjust myself to them?"

    "raw_text": "PHILOSOPHER: Yes. In the sense that you are concerned solely with the “I,” you are self-\ncentered. You want to be thought well of by others, and that is why you worry about the way\nthey look at you. That is not concern for others. It is nothing but attachment to self.\nYOUTH: But . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: This is something I spoke of last time. The fact that there are people who do\nnot think well of you is proof that you are living in freedom. You might have a sense of\nsomething about this that seems self-centered. But I think you have understood this from\ntoday’s discussion: A way of living in which one is constantly troubled by how one is seen by\nothers is a self-centered lifestyle in which one’s sole concern is with the “I.”\nYOUTH: Well, now, that is an astounding statement!\nPHILOSOPHER: Not just you, but all people who are attached to the “I” are self-centered. And\nthat is precisely why it is necessary to make the switch from “attachment to self” to “concern\nfor others.”\nYOUTH: Okay, so yes, it is true that I am always looking only at myself, that, I acknowledge.\nI’m constantly worried about how other people see me, but not about how I see them. If you\nare saying I am self-centered, there is nothing that I can say to refute that. But think about it\nlike this: If my life were a feature-length movie, the protagonist would certainly be this “I,”\nwouldn’t it? Is pointing the camera at the protagonist really such a reprehensible thing?\n\f\nYou Are Not the Center of the World\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s go over things in order. First of all, each of us is a member of a\ncommunity, and that is where we belong. Feeling that one has one’s own place of refuge\nwithin the community, feeling that “it’s okay to be here,” and having a sense of belonging—\nthese are basic human desires. Whether it is one’s studies, work, or friendships, or one’s love\nor marriage, all these things are connected to one’s search for places and relationships in\nwhich one can feel “it’s okay to be here.” Wouldn’t you agree?\nYOUTH: Ah, yes, I do! That’s it exactly!\nPHILOSOPHER: And the protagonist in one’s life is the “I.” There is nothing wrong with the\ntrain of thought up to this point. But the “I” does not rule the center of the world. While the\n“I” is life’s protagonist, it is never more than a member of the community and a part of the\nwhole.\nYOUTH: A part of the whole?\nPHILOSOPHER: People who have concern only for themselves think that they are at the center\nof the world. To such people, others are merely “people who will do something for me.”\nThey half genuinely believe that everyone else exists to serve them and should give precedence\nto their feelings.\nYOUTH: Just like a prince or a princess.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, exactly. They make a leap from being “life’s protagonist” to becoming\n“the world’s protagonist.” For this reason, whenever they come into contact with another\nperson, all they can think is, What will this person give me? However—and this is something\nthat does not hold true for princes and princesses—this expectation is not going to be\nsatis\u0000ed on every occasion. Because other people are not living to satisfy your expectations.\nYOUTH: Indeed.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then, when those expectations are not satis\u0000ed, they become deeply\ndisillusioned and feel as if they have been horribly insulted. And they become resentful, and\nthink, That person didn’t do anything for me. That person let me down. That person isn’t my"

    "raw_text": "comrade anymore. He’s my enemy. People who hold the belief that they are the center of the\nworld always end up losing their comrades before long.\nYOUTH: That’s strange. Didn’t you say that we are living in a subjective world? As long as the\nworld is a subjective space, I am the only one who can be at its center. I won’t let anyone else\nbe there.\nPHILOSOPHER: I think that when you speak of “the world,” what you have in mind is\nsomething like a map of the world.\nYOUTH: A map of the world? What are you talking about?\nPHILOSOPHER: For example, on the map of the world used in France, the Americas are located\non the left side, and Asia is on the right. Europe and France are depicted at the center of the\nmap, of course. The map of the world used in China, on the other hand, shows the Americas\non the right side and Europe on the left. French people who see the Chinese map of the\nworld will most likely experience a di\u0000cult-to-describe sense of incongruity, as if they have\nbeen driven unjustly to the fringes, or cut out of the world arbitrarily.\nYOUTH: Yes, I see your point.\nPHILOSOPHER: But what happens when a globe is used to represent the world? Because with a\nglobe, you can look at the world with France at the center, or China, or Brazil, for that\nmatter. Every place is central, and no place is, at the same time. The globe may be dotted with\nan in\u0000nite number of centers, in accordance with the viewer’s location and angle of view.\nThat is the nature of a globe.\nYOUTH: Hmm, that is true.\nPHILOSOPHER: Think of what I said earlier—that you are not the center of the world—as\nbeing the same thing. You are a part of a community, not its center.\nYOUTH: I am not the center of the world. Our world is a globe, not a map that has been cut\nout on a plane. Well, I can understand that in theory, anyway. But why do I have to be aware\nof the fact that I’m not the center of the world?\nPHILOSOPHER: Now we will go back to where we started. All of us are searching for the sense\nof belonging, that “it’s okay to be here.” In Adlerian psychology, however, a sense of\nbelonging is something that one can attain only by making an active commitment to the\ncommunity of one’s own accord, and not simply by being here.\nYOUTH: By making an active commitment? What does one do, exactly?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: One faces one’s life tasks. In other words, one takes steps forward on one’s\nown, without avoiding the tasks of the interpersonal relations of work, friendship, and love.\nIf you are “the center of the world,” you will have no thoughts whatsoever regarding\ncommitment to the community; because everyone else is “someone who will do something\nfor me,” and there is no need for you to do things yourself. But you are not the center of the\nworld, and neither am I. One has to stand on one’s own two feet, and take one’s own steps\nforward with the tasks of interpersonal relations. One needs to think not, What will this\nperson give me? but rather, What can I give to this person? That is commitment to the\ncommunity.\nYOUTH: It is because one gives something that one can \u0000nd one’s refuge?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. A sense of belonging is something that one acquires through\none’s own e\u0000orts—it is not something one is endowed with at birth. Community feeling is\nthe much-debated key concept of Adlerian psychology.\nIt was certainly a concept that the young man found di\u0000cult to accept at \u0000rst. And\nnaturally, it upset him to be told he was self-centered. But what he found hardest to\naccept was the incredible extent of that community, which included the universe and\ninanimate objects. What were Adler and this philosopher talking about, anyway?\nWith a bewildered expression, the young man slowly opened his mouth to speak.\n\f\nListen to the Voice of a Larger Community\nYOUTH: I must admit, you’re starting to lose me. Let me try to straighten things out a bit.\nFirst, at the gateway of interpersonal relations, we’ve got the separation of tasks, and as the\ngoal, there’s community feeling. And you’re saying that community feeling is having “a sense\nof others as comrades” and “an awareness of having one’s own refuge” within the\ncommunity. Up to this point, it is something I can understand and accept. But the details still\nseem a bit far-fetched. For one thing, what do you mean by expanding this thing you call\n“community” to include the entire universe, and then even the past and the future, and\neverything from living things to inanimate objects?\nPHILOSOPHER: It certainly does make things more di\u0000cult to understand if one takes Adler’s\nconcept of community literally and tries to actually imagine it including the universe and\ninanimate objects. For the time being, su\u0000ce it to say that the scope of community is in\u0000nite.\nYOUTH: In\u0000nite?\nPHILOSOPHER: Take, for example, a man who, on reaching retirement age and stopping work,\nquickly loses his vitality and becomes depressed. Abruptly cut o\u0000 from the company that was\nhis community and bereft of title or profession, he becomes an “ordinary nobody.” As he is\nunable to accept the fact that he is now “normal,” he becomes old practically overnight. But\nall that really happened to the man is that he was cut o\u0000 from the small community that is his\ncompany. Each person belongs to a separate community. And when it comes down to it, all\nof us belong to the community of the earth, and the community of the universe.\nYOUTH: That’s pure sophistry! To suddenly come out with “You belong to the universe,” as if\nthat could give someone a sense of belonging.\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s true, there’s no way one can just imagine the entire universe all of a\nsudden. Even so, I would like you to gain the awareness that you belong to a separate, larger\ncommunity that is beyond the one you see in your immediate vicinity—for example, the\ncountry or local society in which you live—and that you are contributing in some way within\nthat community.\n\f\nYOUTH: Then what about in a situation like this? Say there’s a guy who’s unmarried, who has\nlost his job and his friends, and who avoids the company of other people and just lives o\u0000 the\nmoney his parents left him. So he’s basically running away from all the tasks of work and\ntasks of friendship and tasks of love. Would you say that even a guy like that belongs to some\nsort of community?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. Say he goes out to buy a loaf of bread. He pays for it with a coin.\nThat coin does not simply go back to the bakers of the bread. It goes to the producers of \u0000our\nand butter, to the people who deliver those ingredients, to the purveyors of the gasoline used\nby the delivery vehicles, to people in the oil-producing countries where that fuel comes from,\nand so on. So it’s all connected. People are never truly alone or separate from community, and\ncannot be.\nYOUTH: So you’re saying I should fantasize more when I buy bread?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is not fantasy. It is fact. The community Adler speaks of goes beyond things\nwe can see, like our households and societies, to include those connections that we cannot\nsee.\nYOUTH: Excuse me for saying so, but you’re escaping into abstract theory. The issue we\nshould be addressing here is the sense of belonging, that “it’s okay to be here.” And then,\nwith regard to the meaning of this sense of belonging, it is the community we can see that is\nstronger. You will agree with that, won’t you? For example, if we compare the “company”\ncommunity with the “earth” community, the sense of belonging of someone who says “I am\na member of this company” would be stronger. To borrow your terminology, the distance\nand depth of the interpersonal relations are completely di\u0000erent. It’s only natural that when\nwe search for a sense of belonging, we will be attracted to the smaller community.\nPHILOSOPHER: That is a perceptive observation. So let’s start thinking about why we should\nbe aware of multiple and larger communities. As I stated earlier, all of us belong to multiple\ncommunities. We belong to our households, our schools, our workplaces, and the local\nsocieties and the countries in which we live. This far you agree, yes?\nYOUTH: Yes, I do.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, suppose that you, as a student, regarded the community that is “school”\nas absolute. In other words, school is everything to you, your “I” exists because of school, and\nno other “I” is possible without it. But naturally, there will be occasions within that\ncommunity when you run into adversity. It could be getting bullied, or not being able to\nmake friends, or not keeping up with your schoolwork, or not adapting to the system of the\n\f\nschool in the \u0000rst place. That is to say, it’s possible that with regard to the community that is\nyour school, you won’t have that “It’s okay to be here” sense of belonging.\nYOUTH: Yes, absolutely. That’s quite possible.\nPHILOSOPHER: When that happens, if you are thinking of school as being everything to you,\nyou will end up without a sense of belonging to anything. And then, you will escape within a\nsmaller community, such as your home. You will shut yourself in, and maybe even turn to\nviolence against members of your own family. And by doing such things, you will be\nattempting to gain a sense of belonging somehow. What I would like you to focus on here,\nthough, is that there is “a more separate community” and, moreover, that there is “a larger\ncommunity.”\nYOUTH: What does that mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: That there is a larger world that extends far beyond the con\u0000nes of the school.\nAnd every one of us is a member of that world. If there is no place of refuge in your school,\nyou should \u0000nd a di\u0000erent refuge outside the walls of the school. You can change schools,\nand it’s \u0000ne to withdraw from school, too. A community that you can break relations with by\nsimply submitting a withdrawal notice is one that you can have only so much connection to,\nin any case. Once you know how big the world is, you will see that all the hardship you went\nthrough in school was a storm in a teacup. The moment you leave the teacup, that raging\nstorm will be gone, and a gentle breeze will greet you in its place.\nYOUTH: Are you saying that as long as you keep yourself shut up inside the teacup, you’ll\nnever stand a chance outside it?\nPHILOSOPHER: Secluding yourself in your room is akin to staying in the teacup, as if you are\nhunkering down in a small shelter. You might be able to wait out the rain for a short while,\nbut the storm will continue unabated.\nYOUTH: Well, maybe in theory, anyway. But it’s hard to break out. The decision to withdraw\nfrom school itself isn’t something to be taken lightly.\nPHILOSOPHER: I am sure you are right—it would not be easy. Therefore, there is a principle of\naction that I would like you to commit to memory. When we run into di\u0000culties in our\ninterpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider \u0000rst\nand foremost is the principle that says, “Listen to the voice of the larger community.”\nYOUTH: The voice of the larger community?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: If it is a school, one does not judge things with the common sense of the\ncommunity that is the school, but instead follows the common sense of a larger community.\nNow, let’s say it’s your school, and your teacher has been behaving in an authoritarian\nmanner. But the power or authority your teacher wields are nothing more than an aspect of\nthe common sense that operates only within the small community that is the school. From\nthe standpoint of the community that is “human society,” both you and your teacher are\nequal humans. If unreasonable demands are being thrust on you, it is \u0000ne to object to them\ndirectly.\nYOUTH: But it will be very di\u0000cult to object when the teacher is right in front of me.\nPHILOSOPHER: Not at all. Though this might be termed a “you and I” relationship, if it is one\nthat can break down just because you raise an objection, then it is not the sort of relationship\nyou need to get into in the \u0000rst place. It is \u0000ne to just let go of it. Living in fear of one’s\nrelationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people.\nYOUTH: You’re saying to choose freedom at the same time that I have community feeling?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, of course. Do not cling to the small community right in front of you.\nThere will always be more “you and I,” and more “everyone,” and larger communities that\nexist."

    "raw_text": "Do Not Rebuke or Praise\nYOUTH: Well, all right. But don’t you see? You haven’t touched on the essential point, that is,\nthe course of progression from the separation of tasks to community feeling. So \u0000rst, I\nseparate the tasks. I think of my tasks as being up to this point, and everything beyond that is\nother people’s tasks. I don’t intervene in other people’s tasks, and I draw a line so that other\npeople won’t intervene in mine. But how can one build interpersonal relations with this\nseparation of tasks and arrive in the end at the community feeling that “it’s okay to be here”?\nHow does Adlerian psychology advise us to overcome the life tasks of work, friendship, and\nlove? It seems like you’re just trying to confuse me with abstract words, without going into\nany concrete explanation.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, you’ve hit on the important point. How does carrying out the separating\nof tasks connect with good relations? That is to say, how does it connect with building the\nkind of relations in which we cooperate and act in harmony with each other? Which brings\nus to the concept of “horizontal relationship.”\nYOUTH: Horizontal relationship?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s start with an easily understood example, that of the parent-child\nrelationship. Whether the circumstances are, for example, those of child-rearing, or of\ntraining junior sta\u0000 in the workplace, generally speaking there are two approaches that are\nconsidered: one is the method of raising by rebuke, and the other is the method of raising by\npraise.\nYOUTH: Ah. That is a hotly debated issue.\nPHILOSOPHER: Which one do you think is the better choice? To rebuke or to praise?\nYOUTH: It’s better to raise by praising, of course.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why?\nYOUTH: Take animal training, for example. When teaching animals to do tricks, you can make\nthem obey with a whip. This is the typical “raising by rebuke” way. On the other hand, it’s\nalso possible to get animals to learn tricks by holding up rewards of food or saying kind\n\f\nwords. This is “raising by praise.” Both ways can lead to the same results—they learn new\ntricks. But the motivation for moving toward the objective is completely di\u0000erent if the\nanimal is doing it because it will be rebuked or doing it because it wants to be praised. In the\nlatter instance, it will come with a feeling of joy. Rebuke only makes the animal wither. But\nraising with praise naturally allows it to grow strong and healthy. This seems like an obvious\nconclusion.\nPHILOSOPHER: Animal training is an interesting example. Now let’s look at this from the\nstandpoint of Adlerian psychology. In Adlerian psychology, we take the stance that in child-\nrearing, and in all other forms of communication with other people, one must not praise.\nYOUTH: One must not praise?\nPHILOSOPHER: Physical punishment is out of the question, of course, and rebuking is not\naccepted, either. One must not praise, and one must not rebuke. That is the standpoint of\nAdlerian psychology.\nYOUTH: But how is that even possible?\nPHILOSOPHER: Consider the reality of the act of praise. For example, suppose I praised a\nstatement you made by saying, “Good job!” Wouldn’t hearing those words seem strange\nsomehow?\nYOUTH: Yes, I guess it would put me in an unpleasant mood.\nPHILOSOPHER: Can you explain why it would feel unpleasant?\nYOUTH: What’s unpleasant is the feeling that from the words “Good job!” one is being talked\ndown to.\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. In the act of praise, there is the aspect of it being “the passing of\njudgment by a person of ability on a person of no ability.” A mother praises her child who\nhas helped her prepare dinner, saying, “You’re such a good helper!” But when her husband\ndoes the same things, you can be sure she won’t be telling him, “You’re such a good helper!”\nYOUTH: Ha-ha, you are right about that.\nPHILOSOPHER: In other words, the mother who praises the child by saying things like “You’re\nsuch a good helper!” or “Good job!” or “Well, aren’t you something!” is unconsciously\ncreating a hierarchical relationship and seeing the child as beneath her. The example of\nanimal training that you just gave is also emblematic of the hierarchical relationship—the\nvertical relationship—that is behind the praising. When one person praises another, the goal\n\f\nis “to manipulate someone who has less ability than you.” It is not done out of gratitude or\nrespect.\nYOUTH: So you’re saying that one praises in order to manipulate?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Whether we praise or rebuke others, the only di\u0000erence is one of\nthe carrot or the stick, and the background goal is manipulation. The reason Adlerian\npsychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment education is that its intention is to\nmanipulate children.\nYOUTH: No way, you’re wrong there. Because think of it from the standpoint of the child.\nFor children, isn’t being praised by their parents the greatest joy of all? It’s because they want\npraise that they do their studies. It’s because they want praise that they learn to behave\nproperly. That’s how it was for me when I was a child. How I craved praise from my parents!\nAnd even after becoming an adult, it’s been the same way. When your boss praises you, it\nfeels good. That’s how it is for everyone. This has nothing to do with reason—it’s just\ninstinctual emotion!\nPHILOSOPHER: One wishes to be praised by someone. Or conversely, one decides to give praise\nto someone. This is proof that one is seeing all interpersonal relationships as “vertical\nrelationships.” This holds true for you, too: It is because you are living in vertical\nrelationships that you want to be praised. Adlerian psychology refutes all manner of vertical\nrelationships and proposes that all interpersonal relationships be horizontal relationships. In\na sense, this point may be regarded as the fundamental principle of Adlerian psychology.\nYOUTH: Is this something that is conveyed by the words “equal but not the same”?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Equal, that is to say, horizontal. For example, there are men who verbally\nabuse their wives, who do all the housework, with such remarks as “You’re not bringing in\nany money, so I don’t want to hear it” or “It’s thanks to me that there’s food on the table.”\nAnd I’m sure you’ve heard this one before: “You have everything you need, so what are you\ncomplaining about?” It’s perfectly shameful. Such statements of economic superiority or the\nlike have no connection whatsoever to human worth. A company employee and a full-time\nhousewife simply have di\u0000erent workplaces and roles, and are truly “equal but not the same.”\nYOUTH: I agree entirely.\nPHILOSOPHER: They are probably afraid that women will grow wise to their situation and\nstart earning more than men do, and that women will start asserting themselves. They see all\ninterpersonal relations as vertical relationships, and they are afraid of being seen by women as\nbeneath them. That is to say, they have intense, hidden feelings of inferiority.\n\f\nYOUTH: So in a sense, they are getting into a superiority complex in which they are trying to\nmake a show of their abilities?\nPHILOSOPHER: So it seems. In the \u0000rst place, the feeling of inferiority is an awareness that\narises within vertical relationships. If one can build horizontal relationships that are “equal\nbut not the same” for all people, there will no longer be any room for inferiority complexes to\nemerge.\nYOUTH: Hmm. Maybe I do have an awareness of manipulation somewhere in my psyche\nwhen I go about praising other people. Laying on the \u0000attery to get in good favor with my\nboss—that’s de\u0000nitely manipulation, isn’t it? And it’s the other way around, too. I’ve been\nmanipulated by being praised by others. Funny, I guess that’s just the sort of person I am!\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, in the sense that you have not been able to break out of vertical\nrelationships, it would seem so.\nYOUTH: This is getting interesting! Please go on!"

    "raw_text": "The Encouragement Approach\nPHILOSOPHER: As you may recall from our discussion on the separation of tasks, I brought\nup the subject of intervention. This is the act of intruding on other people’s tasks. So why\ndoes a person intervene? Here, too, in the background, vertical relationships are at play. It is\nprecisely because one perceives interpersonal relations as vertical, and sees the other party as\nbeneath one, that one intervenes. Through intervention, one tries to lead the other party in\nthe desired direction. One has convinced oneself that one is right and that the other party is\nwrong. Of course, the intervention here is manipulation, pure and simple. Parents\ncommanding a child to study is a typical example of this. They might be acting out of the\nbest of intentions from their points of view, but when it comes down to it, the parents are\nintruding and attempting to manipulate the child to go in their desired direction.\nYOUTH: If one can build horizontal relationships, will that intervention disappear?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it will.\nYOUTH: Well, it’s one thing if you’re just talking about a child’s studies. But when someone’s\nsu\u0000ering right there in front of you, you can’t just leave him or her be, can you? Would you\nstill say that lending a helping hand is intervention, and then do nothing?\nPHILOSOPHER: One must not let it go unnoticed. It is necessary to o\u0000er assistance that does\nnot turn into intervention.\nYOUTH: What is the di\u0000erence between intervention and assistance?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think back to our discussion of the separation of tasks, to the subject of a\nchild’s schoolwork. As I stated then, this is a task that the child has to resolve himself, not\nsomething that parents or teachers can do for him. So intervention is this kind of intruding\non other people’s tasks and directing them by saying things like “You have to study” or “Get\ninto that university.” Whereas assistance, on the other hand, presupposes the separation of\ntasks, and also horizontal relationships. Having understood that studying is the child’s task,\none considers what one can do for him. Concretely speaking, instead of commanding from\nabove that the child must study, one acts on him in such a way that he can gain the\ncon\u0000dence to take care of his own studies and face his tasks on his own.\n\f\nYOUTH: And that action isn’t forced?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, it’s not. Without forcing, and with the tasks always kept separate, one\nassists the child to resolve them by his own e\u0000orts. It’s the approach of “You can lead a horse\nto water, but you can’t make him drink.” He is the one who has to face his tasks, and he is the\none who makes the resolution.\nYOUTH: So you neither praise nor rebuke?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right, one neither praises nor rebukes. This kind of assistance, which is\nbased on horizontal relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as “encouragement.”\nYOUTH: Encouragement, huh? Right, that’s the term you mentioned some time ago. You said\nyou’d explain at a later date.\nPHILOSOPHER: When one is not following through with one’s tasks, it is not because one is\nwithout ability. Adlerian psychology tells us that the issue here is not one of ability but\nsimply that “one has lost the courage to face one’s tasks.” And if that is the case, the thing to\ndo before anything else is to recover that lost courage.\nYOUTH: But we’re just going around in circles! That’s basically the same as giving praise.\nWhen one is praised by another person, one becomes truly aware of one’s ability and regains\none’s courage. Please do not be stubborn about this point—just acknowledge the necessity of\ngiving praise.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, I will not acknowledge that.\nYOUTH: Why not?\nPHILOSOPHER: The reason is clear. Being praised is what leads people to form the belief that\nthey have no ability.\nYOUTH: What did you say?\nPHILOSOPHER: Shall I repeat myself? The more one is praised by another person, the more\none forms the belief that one has no ability. Please do your best to remember this.\nYOUTH: Do such foolish people even exist? It’s got to be the other way around! It is as a result\nof being praised that one becomes truly aware of one’s ability. Isn’t that obvious?\nPHILOSOPHER: You are wrong. Even if you do derive joy from being praised, it is the same as\nbeing dependent on vertical relationships and acknowledging that you have no ability.\n\f\nBecause giving praise is a judgment that is passed by a person of ability onto a person without\nability.\nYOUTH: I just cannot agree with that.\nPHILOSOPHER: When receiving praise becomes one’s goal, one is choosing a way of living that\nis in line with another person’s system of values. Looking at your life until now, aren’t you\ntired of trying to live up to your parents’ expectations?\nYOUTH: Um, well, I guess so.\nPHILOSOPHER: First, do the separation of tasks. Then, while accepting each other’s\ndi\u0000erences, build equal horizontal relationships. Encouragement is the approach that comes\nnext."

    "raw_text": "How to Feel You Have Value\nYOUTH: So concretely speaking, how does one go about this? One cannot praise, and one\ncannot rebuke. What other words and choices are there?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think about a time when you’ve had help in your work—not from a child\nbut from a partner who is your equal—and you will probably see the answer right away.\nWhen a friend helps you clean your home, what do you say to him?\nYOUTH: I say, “Thank you.”\nPHILOSOPHER: Right. You convey words of gratitude, saying thank you to this partner who\nhas helped you with your work. You might express straightforward delight: “I’m glad.” Or\nyou could convey your thanks by saying, “That was a big help.” This is an approach to\nencouragement that is based on horizontal relationships.\nYOUTH: That’s all?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. The most important thing is to not judge other people. “Judgment” is a\nword that comes out of vertical relationships. If one is building horizontal relationships,\nthere will be words of more straightforward gratitude and respect and joy.\nYOUTH: Hmm, your point that judgment is created by vertical relationships certainly seems to\nbe true. But what about this? Could the words “thank you” actually have such a great power\nas to be able to bring back courage? After all, I think I’d prefer to be praised, even if the words\nI hear are ones that come from vertical relationships.\nPHILOSOPHER: Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgment from another\nperson as “good.” And the measure of what is good or bad about that act is that person’s\nyardstick. If receiving praise is what one is after, one will have no choice but to adapt to that\nperson’s yardstick and put the brakes on one’s own freedom. “Thank you,” on the other\nhand, rather than being judgment, is a clear expression of gratitude. When one hears words of\ngratitude, one knows that one has made a contribution to another person.\nYOUTH: So even if you’re judged as “good” by another person, you don’t feel that you’ve\nmade a contribution?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. This is a point that will connect to our subsequent discussion as\nwell—in Adlerian psychology, a great deal of emphasis is given to “contribution.”\nYOUTH: Why is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, what does a person have to do to get courage? In Adler’s view, “It is only\nwhen a person is able to feel that he has worth that he can possess courage.”\nYOUTH: When a person is able to feel that he has worth?\nPHILOSOPHER: Do you recall when we were discussing the feeling of inferiority that I spoke of\nthis as being an issue of subjective worth? Is one able to feel one has worth, or does one feel\none is a worthless being? If one is able to feel one has worth, then one can accept oneself just\nas one is and have the courage to face one’s life tasks. So the issue that arises at this point is\nhow on earth can one become able to feel one has worth?\nYOUTH: Yes, that’s it exactly! I need you to explain that very clearly, please.\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s quite simple. It is when one is able to feel “I am bene\u0000cial to the\ncommunity” that one can have a true sense of one’s worth. This is the answer that would be\no\u0000ered in Adlerian psychology.\nYOUTH: That I am bene\u0000cial to the community?\nPHILOSOPHER: That one can act on the community, that is to say, on other people, and that\none can feel “I am of use to someone.” Instead of feeling judged by another person as “good,”\nbeing able to feel, by way of one’s own subjective viewpoint, that “I can make contributions\nto other people.” It is at that point that, at last, we can have a true sense of our own worth.\nEverything we have been discussing about community feeling and encouragement connects\nhere.\nYOUTH: Hmm. I don’t know, it’s starting to get a bit confusing.\nPHILOSOPHER: We are getting to the heart of the discussion now. Please stick with me awhile\nlonger. It is about having concern for others, building horizontal relationships, and taking\nthe approach of encouragement. All these things connect to the deep life awareness of “I am\nof use to someone,” and in turn, to your courage to live.\nYOUTH: To be of use to someone. That is what my life is worth living for . . . ?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s take a little break. Would you like some co\u0000ee?\nYOUTH: Yes, please.\n\f\nThe discussion of community feeling had become more confusing than ever. One\nmust not praise. And one must not rebuke, either. All words that are used to judge\nother people are words that come out of vertical relationships, and we need to build\nhorizontal relationships. And it is only when one is able to feel that one is of use to\nsomeone that one can have a true awareness of one’s worth. There was a major \u0000aw in\nthis logic somewhere. The young man felt it instinctively. As he sipped the hot co\u0000ee,\nthoughts of his grandfather crossed his mind.\n\f\nExist in the Present\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, have you worked things out?\nYOUTH: Gradually, but yes, it’s getting clearer. You don’t seem to be aware of it, but just now\nyou said something really over the top. It’s a dangerous, rather extreme opinion that just\nnegates everything in the world.\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh, really? What is it?\nYOUTH: It’s the idea that being of use to someone is what gives one a true awareness of one’s\nworth. If you put it the other way around, a person who isn’t of any use to others has no\nworth at all. That’s what you are saying, isn’t it? If one takes that to its logical conclusion,\nthen the lives of newborn babies and of invalids and old people who are bedridden aren’t\nworth living either. How could this be? Let’s talk about my grandfather. He spends his days\nbedridden at an old people’s home. Since he has dementia, he doesn’t recognize any of his\nchildren or grandchildren, and his condition is such that he would not be able to go on living\nwithout constant care. One simply couldn’t think of him as being of use to someone. Don’t\nyou see? Your opinion is basically the same thing as saying to my grandfather, “People like you\naren’t quali\u0000ed to live!”\nPHILOSOPHER: I reject that de\u0000nitively.\nYOUTH: How do you reject that?\nPHILOSOPHER: There are parents who refute my explanation of the concept of\nencouragement by saying, “Our child does bad things from morning to night, and there is\nnever an occasion to tell him, ‘Thank you,’ or ‘You helped a lot.’ ” The context is probably the\nsame as what you are talking about, isn’t it?\nYOUTH: Yes, it is. So tell me please how you justify that.\nPHILOSOPHER: At this point, you are looking at another person on the level of his acts. In\nother words, that that person “did something.” So from that point of view, it might seem that\nbedridden old people are only a nuisance and are of no use to anyone. So let’s look at other\npeople not on the “level of acts” but on the “level of being.” Without judging whether or not\n\f\nother people did something, one rejoices in their being there, in their very existence, and one\ncalls out to them with words of gratitude.\nYOUTH: You call out to their existence? What on earth are you talking about?\nPHILOSOPHER: If you consider things at the level of being, we are of use to others and have\nworth just by being here. This is an indisputable fact.\nYOUTH: No way! Enough joking around. Being of use to someone just by being here—that’s\ngot to be straight out of some new religion.\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, for example, suppose your mother has a car accident. Her condition is\nserious, and her life may be in danger. At a time like that, you would not be wondering if\nyour mother “did something,” or anything of the sort. More than likely, you will just be\nthinking you’ll be glad if she makes it, and you’re glad she is holding on right now.\nYOUTH: Of course I would!\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s what it means to be grateful on the level of being. Your mother might\nnot be able to do anything in her critical condition that would be considered an act, but just\nby being alive, she would be supporting the psychological state of you and your family, and\nwould therefore be of use. The same could be said for you, too. If your life were in danger,\nand you were hanging on by a thread, the people around you would probably feel very\ngladdened just by the very fact of your existing. They would simply feel thankful that you are\nsafe in the here and now, and would not be wanting you to perform some direct act. At the\nvery least, there is no reason they would have to think that way. So instead of thinking of\noneself on the level of acts, \u0000rst of all one accepts oneself on the level of being.\nYOUTH: That’s an extreme example—everyday life is di\u0000erent.\nPHILOSOPHER: No, it is the same.\nYOUTH: What is the same about it? Try and give me a more everyday example, please. If you\ncan’t, I won’t be able to agree with this.\nPHILOSOPHER: All right. When we look at other people, we are prone to construct our own\nideal images of ourselves, which we then detract from and judge. Imagine, for example, a\nchild who never talks back to his parents, excels in both schoolwork and sports, attends a\ngood university, and joins a large company. There are parents who will compare their child to\nsuch an image of an ideal child—which is an impossible \u0000ction—and then be \u0000lled with\ncomplaints and dissatisfaction. They treat the idealized image as one hundred points, and\nthey gradually subtract from that. This is truly a “judgment” way of thinking. Instead, the\n\f\nparents could refrain from comparing their child to anyone else, see him for who he actually\nis, and be glad and grateful for his being there. Instead of taking away points from some\nidealized image, they could start from zero. And if they do that, they should be able to call\nout to his existence itself.\nYOUTH: Okay, but I’d say that’s just an idealistic approach. So are you saying that even with\nthe kind of child who never goes to school or gets a job, but just shuts himself in and stays\nhome, one should still communicate one’s gratitude and say thank you?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. Suppose your shut-in child helped you wash the dishes after a\nmeal. If you were to say then, “Enough of that already—just go to school,” you would be\nusing the words of such parents who detract from an image of an ideal child. If you were to\ntake such an approach, the child would probably end up even more discouraged. However, if\nyou can say a straightforward thank you, the child just might feel his own worth and take a\nnew step forward.\nYOUTH: That’s just utterly hypocritical! It’s nothing more than the nonsensical talk of a\nhypocrite. It sounds like the “neighborly love” that Christians talk about. The community\nfeeling, the horizontal relationships, the gratitude for existence, and so on. Who on earth\ncould actually do such things?\nPHILOSOPHER: With regard to this issue of community feeling, there was a person who asked\nAdler a similar question. Adler’s reply was the following: “Someone has to start. Other\npeople might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you\nshould start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.” My advice is exactly\nthe same.\n\f\nPeople Cannot Make Proper Use of Self\nYOUTH: I should start?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Without regard to whether other people are cooperative or not.\nYOUTH: All right, I’ll ask you again. “People can be of use to someone else simply by being\nalive, and have a true sense of their worth just by being alive.” Is that what you are saying?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes.\nYOUTH: Well, I don’t know. I am alive, right here and now. “I,” who is no one else but me, am\nalive right here. But even so, I don’t really feel that I have worth.\nPHILOSOPHER: Can you describe in words why you do not feel that you have worth?\nYOUTH: I suppose it’s what you’ve been referring to as interpersonal relations. From\nchildhood up to the present, I have always been belittled by people around me, especially my\nparents, as a poor excuse for a little brother. They have never really tried to recognize me for\nwho I am. You say that worth is something one gives to oneself. But that’s just an\nimpracticable theory. For example, at the library where I work, for the most part my job is just\nsorting the returned books and putting them back on the shelves. It’s routine work that\nanyone could do once they’ve been taught. If I stopped going to work, my boss would have\nno trouble \u0000nding someone to replace me. I am needed only for the unskilled labor I provide,\nand it doesn’t actually matter at all if it is “I” who is working there or someone else, or a\nmachine, for that matter. No one is requiring “this me” in particular. In such circumstances,\nwould you have con\u0000dence in yourself? Would you be able to have a true sense of worth?\nPHILOSOPHER: From an Adlerian psychology point of view, the answer is simple. First of all,\nbuild a horizontal relationship between yourself and another person. One is enough. Let’s\nstart from there.\nYOUTH: Please don’t treat me like a fool! Look, I have friends. And I am building solid\nhorizontal relationships with them.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Even so, I suspect that with your parents and your boss, and with your junior\ncolleagues and other people as well, the relationships you are building are vertical ones.\nYOUTH: Of course, I have di\u0000erent kinds of relationships. That’s how it is for everyone.\nPHILOSOPHER: This is a very important point. Does one build vertical relationships, or does\none build horizontal relationships? This is an issue of lifestyle, and human beings are not so\nclever as to be able to have di\u0000erent lifestyles available whenever the need arises. In other\nwords, deciding that one is “equal to this person” or “in a hierarchical relationship with that\nperson” does not work.\nYOUTH: Do you mean that one has to choose one or the other—vertical relationships or\nhorizontal relationships?\nPHILOSOPHER: Absolutely, yes. If you are building even one vertical relationship with\nsomeone, before you even notice what is happening, you will be treating all your\ninterpersonal relations as vertical.\nYOUTH: So I am treating even my relationships with my friends as vertical?\nPHILOSOPHER: That is correct. Even if you are not treating them in a boss-or-subordinate\nkind of way, it is as if you are saying, “A is above me, and B is below me,” for example, or “I’ll\nfollow A’s advice, but ignore what B says,” or “I don’t mind breaking my promise to C.”\nYOUTH: Hmm!\nPHILOSOPHER: On the other hand, if one has managed to build a horizontal relationship with\nat least one person—if one has been able to build a relationship of equals in the true sense of\nthe term—that is a major lifestyle transformation. With that breakthrough, all one’s\ninterpersonal relations will gradually become horizontal.\nYOUTH: What nonsense! There are so many ways I could refute that. Think of a company\nsetting, for example. It wouldn’t really be feasible for the director and his new recruits to\nform relationships as equals, would it? Hierarchical relationships are part of the system of our\nsociety, and to ignore that is to ignore the social order. Look, if you heard that a new recruit\nat your company, who’s only twenty or so, had suddenly started buddying up to the sixty-\nsomething director, don’t you think it would sound pretty far-fetched?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is certainly important to respect one’s elders. In a company structure, it is\nonly natural for there to be di\u0000erent levels of responsibility. I am not telling you to make\nfriends with everyone, or behave as if you are close friends. Rather, what is important is to be\nequal in consciousness, and to assert that which needs to be asserted.\n\f\nYOUTH: I am not someone who can mouth o\u0000 to my seniors, and I would never think of\ntrying. My social common sense would be called into question if I did.\nPHILOSOPHER: What is “senior”? What is this “mouthing o\u0000”? If one is gauging the\natmosphere of a situation and being dependent on vertical relationships, one is engaging in\nirresponsible acts—one is trying to avoid one’s responsibilities.\nYOUTH: What is irresponsible about it?\nPHILOSOPHER: Suppose that as a result of following your boss’s instructions, your work ends\nin failure. Whose responsibility is it then?\nYOUTH: Well, that’d be my boss’s responsibility. Because I was just following orders, and he\nwas the one who decided on them.\nPHILOSOPHER: None of the responsibility is yours?\nYOUTH: No, it isn’t. It’s the responsibility of the boss who gave the orders. This is what’s\nknown as organizational accountability.\nPHILOSOPHER: You are wrong. That is a life-lie. There is space for you to refuse, and there\nshould also be space to propose a better way of doing things. You are just thinking there is no\nspace to refuse so that you can avoid the con\u0000ict of the associated interpersonal relations and\navoid responsibility—and you are being dependent on vertical relationships.\nYOUTH: Are you saying I should disobey my boss? Sure, in theory, I should. Theoretically, it’s\nexactly as you say. But I can’t do that! There’s no way I could build a relationship like that.\nPHILOSOPHER: Really? You are building a horizontal relationship with me right now. You are\nasserting yourself very well. Instead of thinking about this or that di\u0000culty, you can just start\nhere.\nYOUTH: I can start here?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, in this small study. As I told you earlier, to me you are an irreplaceable\nfriend.\nYOUTH: . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Am I wrong?\nYOUTH: I appreciate it, I really do. But I am afraid. I am afraid of accepting your proposal.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: What are you afraid of, exactly?\nYOUTH: The tasks of friendship, naturally. I have never befriended an older man like you. I\nhave no idea if a friend relationship with such a di\u0000erence in age is even possible, or if I had\nbetter think of it as a student-teacher relationship.\nPHILOSOPHER: Age does not matter in love and friendship. It is certainly true that the tasks of\nfriendship require a steady courage. With regard to your relationship with me, it will be \u0000ne\nto reduce the distance little by little. To a degree of distance in which we are not in very close\ncontact but can still reach out and touch each other’s faces with our outstretched arms, so to\nspeak.\nYOUTH: Please give me some time. Just once more, I would like some time to try to \u0000gure\nthings out on my own. Our discussion today has given me much to think about. I would like\nto take it all home and ruminate on it calmly on my own.\nPHILOSOPHER: It takes time to gain a true understanding of community feeling. It would be\nquite impossible to understand everything about it right here and now. Please return to your\nhome and give it some careful thought, while checking it against everything else we have\ndiscussed.\nYOUTH: I will. In any case, it was quite a blow to be told that I never really look at others, and\nI only have concern for myself. You’re really a dreadful fellow!\nPHILOSOPHER: Ha-ha. You say it in such a happy way.\nYOUTH: Yes, I enjoy it immensely. It hurts, of course. It’s like a sharp pain that shoots through\nme, as if I were swallowing needles. But still, I enjoy it immensely. It’s habit-forming, having\nthese discussions with you. I realized a little while ago that maybe I don’t just want to take\napart your argument—I want you to take apart mine, too.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. That’s an interesting analysis.\nYOUTH: But don’t forget. I told you that I am going to take apart your argument and bring\nyou to your knees, and I haven’t given up.\nPHILOSOPHER: Thank you. I’ve had a good time, too. Come by whenever you’re ready to pick\nthis back up."

    "raw_text": "Excessive Self-Consciousness Sti\u0000es the Self\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?\nYOUTH: Yes, I last came about a month ago. I have been thinking about the meaning of\ncommunity feeling since then.\nPHILOSOPHER: So how do you feel about it now?\nYOUTH: Well, community feeling is de\u0000nitely an attractive idea. The sense of belonging, that\n“it’s okay to be here,” for example, which we possess as a fundamental desire. I think it is a\nbrilliant insight into our existence as social creatures.\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s a brilliant insight, except . . . ?\nYOUTH: Funny, you caught on right away. That’s right, I still have some issues with it. I’ll say\nit straight out—I have no idea what you are going on about with your references to the\nuniverse and all that, and it ends up reeking of religion from beginning to end. There’s this\nkind of cultish quality to it all that I just can’t shake.\nPHILOSOPHER: When Adler \u0000rst proposed the concept of community feeling, there was a\ngreat deal of opposition in a similar vein. People said that psychology is supposed to be a\nscience, and here was Adler discussing the issue of worth. That sort of thing isn’t science,\nthey said.\nYOUTH: So in my own way, I tried to \u0000gure out why I couldn’t understand what you were\ntalking about, and I’m thinking that the order of things might be the problem. You’re\nstarting o\u0000 with the universe and inanimate objects, and the past and the future and so on, so\nI lose track of things. Instead, one should get a \u0000rm grasp of the “I.” Next, one should\ncontemplate one-on-one relationships. That is to say, the interpersonal relationships of “you\nand I.” And once one has done that, the larger community should come into view.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. That is a good order.\nYOUTH: Now, the \u0000rst thing I want to ask about is attachment to self. You are saying that one\nhas to stop being attached to the “I” and make the switch to “concern for others.” I am sure it\n\f\nis exactly as you say—concern for others is important, I agree. But no matter what, we worry\nabout ourselves; we look at ourselves all the time.\nPHILOSOPHER: Have you thought about why we worry about ourselves?\nYOUTH: I have. If I were a narcissist, for example—if I were in love with myself and constantly\nfascinated with myself—maybe that would simplify things. Because your instruction, “Have\nmore concern for others,” is a perfectly sound one. But I am not a self-loving narcissist. I am a\nself-loathing realist. I hate who I am, and that’s exactly why I look at myself all the time. I\ndon’t have con\u0000dence in myself, and that’s why I am excessively self-conscious.\nPHILOSOPHER: At what times do you feel that you are excessively self-conscious?\nYOUTH: Well, at meetings, for example, I have a hard time raising my hand and making myself\nheard. I think needless things, like If I ask this question, they’ll probably laugh at me, or If the\npoint I want to make is irrelevant, I’ll get ridiculed, and so on, and I just clam up. Truthfully, I\nfalter even when it comes to telling silly jokes in front of people. Every time, my self-\nconsciousness kicks in and puts the brakes on, and it’s as if I’ve been straitjacketed. My self-\nconsciousness won’t allow me to behave in an innocent way. But I don’t even have to ask for\nyour answer. I’m sure it’ll be the same as always: Have courage. But you know, such words are\nof no use to me. Because this isn’t just a matter of courage.\nPHILOSOPHER: I see. Last time, I gave an overview of community feeling. Today, we will dig\ndeeper.\nYOUTH: And where will that take us?\nPHILOSOPHER: We will probably arrive at the question, What is happiness?\nYOUTH: Oh! So happiness lies beyond community feeling?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no need to rush the answers. What we need is dialogue.\nYOUTH: All right, then. So let’s get started!"

    "raw_text": "Not Self-A\u0000rmation— Self-Acceptance\nPHILOSOPHER: First of all, let’s look at what you were just saying, about your self-\nconsciousness putting the brakes on and not letting you behave in an innocent way. There are\nprobably many people who experience this trouble. So let’s go back to the source again and\nthink about your goal. What could you be trying to gain by putting the brakes on your own\ninnocent behavior?\nYOUTH: It’s the genuine desire to not be laughed at, to not be thought of as a fool.\nPHILOSOPHER: So in other words, you do not have con\u0000dence in your innocent self, in\nyourself just as you are, right? And you stay away from the kind of interpersonal relationship\nin which you would just be yourself. But I’ll bet that when you’re home alone, you sing out\nloud and dance to music and speak in a lively voice.\nYOUTH: Ha-ha! It’s almost like you’ve set up a surveillance camera in my room! But yes, it’s\ntrue. I can behave freely when I’m alone.\nPHILOSOPHER: Anyone can behave like a king when they’re alone. So this is an issue that\nshould be considered in the context of interpersonal relations. Because it isn’t that you don’t\nhave an innocent self—it is only that you can’t do such things in front of others.\nYOUTH: Well, what should I do then?\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s about community feeling, after all. Concretely speaking, it’s making the\nswitch from attachment to self (self-interest) to concern for others (social interest) and\ngaining a sense of community feeling. Three things are needed at this point: “self-\nacceptance,” “con\u0000dence in others,” and “contribution to others.”\nYOUTH: Interesting. New keywords, I see. What do they refer to?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s start with self-acceptance. On our \u0000rst night, I brought up that\nstatement of Adler’s: “The important thing is not what one is born with but what use one\nmakes of that equipment.” Do you remember this?\nYOUTH: Yes, of course.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: We cannot discard the receptacle that is the “I,” and neither can we replace it.\nThe important thing, however, is “what use one makes of that equipment.” One changes\none’s way of looking at the “I”—that is to say, one changes how one uses it.\nYOUTH: Does that mean be more positive and have a stronger sense of self-a\u0000rmation? Think\nabout everything more positively?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no need to go out of one’s way to be positive and a\u0000rm oneself. It’s\nnot self-a\u0000rmation that we are concerned with, but self-acceptance.\nYOUTH: Not self-a\u0000rmation, but self-acceptance?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. There is a clear di\u0000erence. Self-a\u0000rmation is making suggestions\nto oneself, such as “I can do it” or “I am strong,” even when something is simply beyond\none’s ability. It is a notion that can bring about a superiority complex, and may even be\ntermed a way of living in which one lies to oneself. With self-acceptance, on the other hand, if\none cannot do something, one is simply accepting “one’s incapable self” as is and moving\nforward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. To put it\nmore simply, say you’ve got a score of 60 percent, but you tell yourself, I just happened to get\nunlucky this time around, and the real me is 100 percent. That is self-a\u0000rmation. By contrast,\nif one accepts oneself as one is, as 60 percent, and thinks to oneself, How should I go about\ngetting closer to 100 percent?—that is self-acceptance.\nYOUTH: So even if you’re only 60 percent, there’s no need to be pessimistic?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course not. No one is perfect. Do you recall what I said when I was\nexplaining the pursuit of superiority? That all people are in this condition of wanting to\nimprove? Put the other way around, there is no such thing as a 100 percent person. This is\nsomething we should actively acknowledge.\nYOUTH: Hmm. What you are saying sounds positive in various respects, but it has a negative\nring to it as well.\nPHILOSOPHER: Here I use the term “a\u0000rmative resignation.”\nYOUTH: A\u0000rmative resignation?\nPHILOSOPHER: This is also the case with the separation of tasks—one ascertains the things\none can change and the things one cannot change. One cannot change what one is born\nwith. But one can, under one’s own power, go about changing what use one makes of that\nequipment. So in that case, one simply has to focus on what one can change, rather than on\nwhat one cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance.\n\f\nYOUTH: What one can change, and what one cannot.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Accept what is irreplaceable. Accept “this me” just as it is. And\nhave the courage to change what one can change. That is self-acceptance.\nYOUTH: Hmm. That reminds me of a line that the writer Kurt Vonnegut quoted in one of his\nbooks: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change\nthe things I can; and wisdom to know the di\u0000erence.” It’s in the novel Slaughterhouse-Five.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, I know it. It is the Serenity Prayer. These words are well known and have\nbeen transmitted for many years in Christian societies.\nYOUTH: He even used the word “courage.” I read the book so intently I should know it by\nheart. But I never noticed this point until now.\nPHILOSOPHER: It’s true. We do not lack ability. We just lack courage. It all comes down to\ncourage.\n\f\nThe Di\u0000erence Between Trust and Con\u0000dence\nYOUTH: There is something about this “a\u0000rmative resignation” that sounds pessimistic. It’s\njust too bleak if the upshot of all this lengthy discussion is resignation.\nPHILOSOPHER: Is that so? Resignation has the connotation of seeing clearly with fortitude\nand acceptance. Having a \u0000rm grasp on the truth of things—that is resignation. There is\nnothing pessimistic about it.\nYOUTH: A \u0000rm grasp on the truth . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, just because one has arrived at a\u0000rmative resignation as one’s self-\nacceptance, it does not automatically follow that one \u0000nds community feeling. That is the\nreality. When one is switching from attachment to self to concern for others, the second key\nconcept—con\u0000dence in others—becomes absolutely essential.\nYOUTH: Con\u0000dence in others. In other words, believing in others?\nPHILOSOPHER: Here, I will consider the words “believing in others” in the context of\ndistinguishing trust from con\u0000dence. First, when we speak of trust, we are referring to\nsomething that comes with set conditions. We refer to it as credit. For example, when one\nwants to borrow money from a bank, one has to have some kind of security. The bank\ncalculates the amount of the loan based on the value of that security, and says, “We will lend\nyou this much.” The attitude of “We will lend it to you on the condition that you will pay it\nback” or “We will lend you as much as you are able to pay back” is not one of having\ncon\u0000dence in someone. It is trust.\nYOUTH: Well, that’s how bank \u0000nancing works, I guess.\nPHILOSOPHER: By contrast, from the standpoint of Adlerian psychology, the basis of\ninterpersonal relations is founded not on trust but on con\u0000dence.\nYOUTH: And “con\u0000dence” in this case is . . . ?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is doing without any set conditions whatsoever when believing in others.\nEven if one does not have su\u0000cient objective grounds for trusting someone, one believes.\n\f\nOne believes unconditionally without concerning oneself with such things as security. That\nis con\u0000dence.\nYOUTH: Believing unconditionally? So it’s back to your pet notion of neighborly love?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, if one believes in others without setting any conditions whatsoever,\nthere will be times when one gets taken advantage of. Just like the guarantor of a debt, there\nare times when one may su\u0000er damages. The attitude of continuing to believe in someone\neven in such instances is what we call con\u0000dence.\nYOUTH: Only a naïve dimwit would do such a thing! I guess you hold with the doctrine of\ninnate human goodness, while I hold with the doctrine of innate human evilness. Believe\nunconditionally in complete strangers, and you’ll just get used and abused.\nPHILOSOPHER: And there are also times when someone deceives you, and you get used that\nway. But look at it from the standpoint of someone who has been taken advantage of. There\nare people who will continue to believe in you unconditionally even if you are the one who\nhas taken advantage of them. People who will have con\u0000dence in you no matter how they are\ntreated. Would you be able to betray such a person again and again?\nYOUTH: Um, no. Well, it would be . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: I am sure it would be quite di\u0000cult for you to do such a thing.\nYOUTH: After all that, are you saying one has to appeal to the emotions? To keep on holding\nthe faith, like a saint, and act on the conscience of the other person? You’re telling me that\nmorals don’t matter to Adler, but isn’t that exactly what we’re talking about here?\nPHILOSOPHER: No, it is not. What would you say is the opposite of con\u0000dence?\nYOUTH: An antonym of con\u0000dence? Uh . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: It is doubt. Suppose you have placed “doubt” at the foundation of your\ninterpersonal relations. That you live your life doubting other people—doubting your\nfriends and even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship could possibly\narise from that? The other person will detect the doubt in your eyes in an instant. He or she\nwill have an instinctive understanding that “this person does not have con\u0000dence in me.” Do\nyou think one would be able to build some kind of positive relationship from that point? It is\nprecisely because we lay a foundation of unconditional con\u0000dence that it is possible for us to\nbuild a deep relationship.\nYOUTH: Okay, I guess.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: The way to understand Adlerian psychology is simple. Right now, you are\nthinking, If I were to have conﬁdence in someone unconditionally, I would just get taken\nadvantage of. However, you are not the one who decides whether or not to take advantage.\nThat is the other person’s task. All you need to do is think, What should I do? If you are\ntelling yourself, I’ll give it to him if he isn’t going take advantage of me, it is just a relationship\nof trust that is based on security or conditions.\nYOUTH: So one separates tasks there, too?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. As I have stated repeatedly, carrying out the separation of tasks returns life\nto an astonishingly simple form. But while the principle of the separation of tasks is easy to\ngrasp, putting it into practice is di\u0000cult. I recognize that.\nYOUTH: Then you are telling me to keep on having con\u0000dence in everyone, to keep on\nbelieving in all other people even when they deceive me, and just go on being a naïve fool?\nThat’s not philosophy or psychology or anything of the sort—it’s just the preaching of a\nzealot!\nPHILOSOPHER: I reject that de\u0000nitively. Adlerian psychology is not saying “have con\u0000dence in\nothers unconditionally” on the basis of a moralistic system of values. Unconditional\ncon\u0000dence is a means for making your interpersonal relationship with a person better and for\nbuilding a horizontal relationship. If you do not have the desire to make your relationship\nwith that person better, then go ahead and sever it. Because carrying out the severing is your\ntask.\nYOUTH: Then what if I’ve placed unconditional con\u0000dence in a friend in order to make our\nrelationship better? I’ve jumped through all sorts of hoops for this friend, gladly satis\u0000ed any\nrequests for money, and been unstinting with my time and e\u0000orts in his regard. But even in\nsuch cases, there are times when one is taken advantage of. For example, if one were horribly\ntaken advantage of by a person one has believed in completely, wouldn’t that experience lead\none to a lifestyle with an “other people are my enemies” outlook?\nPHILOSOPHER: It seems that you have not yet gained an understanding of the goal of\ncon\u0000dence. Suppose, for example, that you are in a love relationship, but you are having\ndoubts about your partner and you think to yourself, I’ll bet she’s cheating on me. And you\nstart making desperate e\u0000orts in search of evidence to prove that. What do you think would\nhappen as a result?\nYOUTH: Well, I guess that would depend on the situation.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: No, in every instance, you would \u0000nd an abundance of evidence that she has\nbeen cheating on you.\nYOUTH: Wait? Why is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Your partner’s casual remarks, her tone when talking to someone on the\nphone, the times when you can’t reach her . . . As long as you are looking with doubt in your\neyes, everything around you will appear to be evidence that she is cheating on you. Even if she\nis not.\nYOUTH: Hmm.\nPHILOSOPHER: Right now, you are only concerned about the times you were taken advantage\nof, and nothing else. You focus only on the pain from the wounds you sustained on such\noccasions. But if you are afraid to have con\u0000dence in others, in the long run you will not be\nable to build deep relationships with anyone.\nYOUTH: Well, I see what you’re getting at—the main objective, which is to build deep\nrelationships. But still, being taken advantage of is scary, and that’s the reality, isn’t it?\nPHILOSOPHER: If it is a shallow relationship, when it falls apart the pain will be slight. And the\njoy that relationship brings each day will also be slight. It is precisely because one can gain the\ncourage to enter into deeper relationships by having con\u0000dence in others that the joy of one’s\ninterpersonal relations can grow, and one’s joy in life can grow, too.\nYOUTH: No! That’s not what I was talking about, you’re changing the subject again. The\ncourage to overcome the fear of being taken advantage of—where does it come from?\nPHILOSOPHER: It comes from self-acceptance. If one can simply accept oneself as one is, and\nascertain what one can do and what one cannot, one becomes able to understand that “taking\nadvantage” is the other person’s task, and getting to the core of “con\u0000dence in others”\nbecomes less di\u0000cult.\nYOUTH: You’re saying that taking advantage of someone is the other person’s task, and one\ncan’t do anything about it? That I should be resigned, in an a\u0000rmative way? Your arguments\nalways ignore our emotions. What does one do about all the anger and sadness one feels when\none is taken advantage of?\nPHILOSOPHER: When one is sad, one should be sad to one’s heart’s content. It is precisely\nwhen one tries to escape the pain and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able to\nbuild deep relationships with anyone. Think about it this way. We can believe. And we can\n\f\ndoubt. But we are aspiring to see others as our comrades. To believe or to doubt—the choice\nshould be clear.\n\f\nThe Essence of Work Is a Contribution to the\nCommon Good\nYOUTH: All right. Well, suppose I have managed to attain self-acceptance. And that I have\nattained con\u0000dence in others, too. What kind of changes would there be in me then?\nPHILOSOPHER: First, one accepts one’s irreplaceable “this me” just as it is. That is self-\nacceptance. Then, one places unconditional con\u0000dence in other people. That is con\u0000dence in\nothers. You can accept yourself, and you can have con\u0000dence in others. So what are other\npeople to you now?\nYOUTH: My comrades?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. In e\u0000ect, placing con\u0000dence in others is connected to seeing others as\ncomrades. It is because they are one’s comrades that one can have con\u0000dence in them. If they\nwere not one’s comrades, one would not be able to reach the level of con\u0000dence. And then,\nhaving other people as one’s comrades connects to \u0000nding refuge in the community one\nbelongs to. So one can gain the sense of belonging, that “it’s okay to be here.”\nYOUTH: In other words, you’re saying that to feel “it’s okay to be here,” one has to see others\nas comrades. And that to see others as comrades, one needs both self-acceptance and\ncon\u0000dence in others.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. You are grasping this more quickly now. To take it a step farther,\none may say that people who think of others as enemies have not attained self-acceptance and\ndo not have enough con\u0000dence in others.\nYOUTH: All right. It is true that people seek the sense of belonging, that “it’s okay to be here.”\nAnd to get that they need self-acceptance and con\u0000dence in others. I have no objection to\nthat. But I don’t know. Can one really gain a sense of belonging just by seeing others as\ncomrades and having con\u0000dence in them?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course, community feeling is not something that is attainable with just\nself-acceptance and con\u0000dence in others. It is at this point that the third key concept—\ncontribution to others—becomes necessary.\n\f\nYOUTH: Contribution to others?\nPHILOSOPHER: Is to act, in some way, on one’s comrades. To attempt to contribute. That is\n“contribution to others.”\nYOUTH: So when you say “contribute,” you mean to show a spirit of self-sacri\u0000ce and to be of\nservice to those around you?\nPHILOSOPHER: Contribution to others does not connote self-sacri\u0000ce. Adler goes so far as to\nwarn that those who sacri\u0000ce their own lives for others are people who have conformed to\nsociety too much. And please do not forget: We are truly aware of our own worth only when\nwe feel that our existence and behavior are bene\u0000cial to the community, that is to say, when\none feels “I am of use to someone.” Do you remember this? In other words, contribution to\nothers, rather than being about getting rid of the “I” and being of service to someone, is\nactually something one does in order to be truly aware of the worth of the “I.”\nYOUTH: Contributing to others is for oneself?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. There is no need to sacri\u0000ce the self.\nYOUTH: Uh-oh, your argument is starting to crumble here, isn’t it? You’ve done a wonderful\njob of digging your own grave. In order to satisfy the “I,” one makes oneself of service to\nothers. Isn’t that the very de\u0000nition of hypocrisy? I said it before: Your entire argument is\nhypocritical. It’s a slippery argument. Look, I would rather believe in the villain who is honest\nabout his desires than the good guy who tells a pack of lies.\nPHILOSOPHER: Those are a lot of hasty conclusions. You do not understand community\nfeeling yet.\nYOUTH: Then I wish you would provide concrete examples of what you consider to be\ncontribution to others.\nPHILOSOPHER: The most easily understood contribution to others is probably work. To be in\nsociety and join the workforce. Or to do the work of taking care of one’s household. Labor is\nnot a means of earning money. It is through labor that one makes contributions to others and\ncommits to one’s community, and that one truly feels “I am of use to someone” and even\ncomes to accept one’s existential worth.\nYOUTH: You are saying that the essence of work is contribution to others?\nPHILOSOPHER: Making money is a major factor too, of course. It is something akin to that\nDostoevsky quote you happened upon: “Money is coined freedom.” But there are people\n\f\nwho have so much money that they could never use it all. And many of these people are\ncontinually busy with their work. Why do they work? Are they driven by boundless greed?\nNo. They work so they are able to contribute to others, and also to con\u0000rm their sense of\nbelonging, their feeling that “it’s okay to be here.” Wealthy people who, on having amassed a\ngreat fortune, focus their energies on charitable activities, are doing so in order to attain a\nsense of their own worth and con\u0000rm for themselves that “it’s okay to be here.”\nYOUTH: Hmm, I suppose that is one truth. But . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: But what?\nSelf-acceptance: accepting one’s irreplaceable “this me” just as it is. Con\u0000dence in\nothers: to place unconditional con\u0000dence at the base of one’s interpersonal relations\nrather than seeding doubt. The young man found these two concepts su\u0000ciently\nconvincing. Contribution to others, however, was something he could not quite\ngrasp. If that contribution is supposed to be “for other people,” then it would have to be\none of bitter self-sacriﬁce. On the other hand, if that contribution is actually “for\noneself,” then it’s the height of hypocrisy. This point has to be made utterly clear. In a\nresolute tone of voice, the young man continued.\n\f\nYoung People Walk Ahead of Adults\nYOUTH: I will acknowledge that work has aspects of contribution to others. But the logic that\nsays that o\u0000cially one is contributing to others when, in actuality, one is doing it for oneself,\nis nothing other than hypocrisy. How do you explain that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Imagine the following kind of scene. It’s after dinner at home, and there are\nstill dishes left on the table. The children have gone o\u0000 to their rooms, and the husband is\nsitting on the sofa watching television. It’s been left to the wife (me) to do the dishes and\nclear everything up. To make matters worse, the family takes that for granted, and they don’t\nmake the slightest e\u0000ort to help. In such a situation, normally one would think, Why won’t\nthey give me a hand? or Why do I have to do all the work? Even if I do not hear the words\n“thank you” from my family while I am cleaning up, I want them to think that I am of use to\nthe family. Instead of thinking about what others can do for me, I want to think about, and\nput into practice, what I can do for other people. Just by having that feeling of contribution,\nthe reality right in front of me will take on a completely di\u0000erent hue. In fact, if I am\ngrumbling to myself as I wash the dishes, I am probably not much fun to be around, so\neveryone just wants to keep their distance. On the other hand, if I’m humming away to\nmyself and washing the dishes in good spirits, the children might come and give me a hand.\nAt the very least, I’d be creating an atmosphere in which it is easier for them to o\u0000er their\nhelp.\nYOUTH: Well, that might be the case in that setting, anyway.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now, how come I have a feeling of contribution in that setting? I have it\nbecause I am able to think of the members of my family as comrades. If I cannot do that,\ninevitably there will be thoughts running through my head like, Why am I the only one doing\nthis? and Why won’t anyone give me a hand? Contribution that is carried out while one is\nseeing other people as enemies may indeed lead to hypocrisy. But if other people are one’s\ncomrades, that should never happen, regardless of the contributions one makes. You have\nbeen \u0000xating on the word “hypocrisy” because you do not understand community feeling\nyet.\nYOUTH: Okay . . .\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: For the sake of convenience, up to this point I have discussed self-acceptance,\ncon\u0000dence in others, and contribution to others, in that order. However, these three are\nlinked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular structure. It is because one accepts\noneself just as one is—one self-accepts—that one can have “con\u0000dence in others” without the\nfear of being taken advantage of. And it is because one can place unconditional con\u0000dence in\nothers, and feel that people are one’s comrades, that one can engage in “contribution to\nothers.” Further, it is because one contributes to others that one can have the deep awareness\nthat “I am of use to someone” and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept. The\nnotes you took down the other day, do you have them with you?\nYOUTH: Oh, you mean that note on the objectives put forward by Adlerian psychology? I’ve\nkept it on me ever since that day, of course. Here it is: “The two objectives for behavior: to be\nself-reliant and to live in harmony with society. The two objectives for the psychology that\nsupports these behaviors: the consciousness that I have the ability and the consciousness that\npeople are my comrades.”\nPHILOSOPHER: If you overlap the content of this note with what we have just been discussing,\nyou should be able to gain a deeper understanding. In other words, “to be self-reliant” and\n“the consciousness that I have the ability” correspond to our discussion of self-acceptance.\nAnd then “to live in harmony with society” and “the consciousness that people are my\ncomrades” connect to con\u0000dence in others and then to contribution to others.\nYOUTH: I see. So the objective of life is community feeling. I think it will be some time before\nI can get this clear in my head, though.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it probably will. As Adler himself said, “Understanding a human being is\nno easy matter. Of all the forms of psychology, individual psychology is probably the most\ndi\u0000cult to learn and put into practice.”\nYOUTH: That’s exactly right! Even if the theories are convincing, it’s hard to put them into\npractice.\nPHILOSOPHER: It is even said that to truly understand Adlerian psychology and apply it to\nactually changing one’s way of living, one needs “half the number of years one has lived.” In\nother words, if you were to start studying it at the age of forty, it would take another twenty\nyears, until you turned sixty. If you were to start studying at the age of twenty, it would take\nten years, until you turned thirty. You are still young. Starting at such an early stage in life\nmeans that you might be able to change more quickly. In the sense that you can change\nquickly, you are walking ahead of the adults of the world. To go about changing yourself and\nmaking a new world, in a way you are ahead of me, too. It is okay to lose your way or lose\nfocus. Do not be dependent on vertical relationships or be afraid of being disliked, and just\n\f\nmake your way forward freely. If all the adults could see that young people were walking\nahead of them, I am sure the world would change dramatically.\nYOUTH: I am walking ahead of you?\nPHILOSOPHER: You certainly are. We walk on the same ground, and you are moving on ahead\nof me.\nYOUTH: Ha-ha. You’re the \u0000rst person I’ve ever met who would say such a thing to someone\nyoung enough to be his son.\nPHILOSOPHER: I would like more and more young people to learn about Adler’s thought.\nAnd I would like more adults to learn about it, too. Because people can change, regardless of\ntheir ages."

    "raw_text": "Workaholism Is a Life-Lie\nYOUTH: All right. I readily admit that I do not have the courage to take steps toward self-\nacceptance or con\u0000dence in others. But is this really the fault only of the “I”? Isn’t it also\nactually a problem brought about by other people, who accuse me unreasonably and attack\nme?\nPHILOSOPHER: To be sure, not everyone in the world is a good and virtuous person. One goes\nthrough any number of unpleasant experiences in one’s interpersonal relations. But there is\nsomething one must not get wrong at this juncture: the fact that, in every instance, it is “that\nperson” who attacks you who has the problem, and it is certainly not the case that everyone is\nbad. People with neurotic lifestyles tend to sprinkle their speech with such words as\n“everyone” and “always” and “everything.” “Everyone hates me,” they will say, or “It’s always\nme who takes a loss,” or “Everything is wrong.” If you think you might be in the habit of\nusing such generalizing statements, you should be careful.\nYOUTH: Well, that does sound rather familiar.\nPHILOSOPHER: In Adlerian psychology, we think of this as a way of living that is lacking in\n“harmony of life.” It is a way of living in which one sees only a part of things but judges the\nwhole.\nYOUTH: Harmony of life?\nPHILOSOPHER: In the teachings of Judaism, one \u0000nds the following anecdote: “If there are ten\npeople, one will be someone who criticizes you no matter what you do. This person will\ncome to dislike you, and you will not learn to like him either. Then, there will be two others\nwho accept everything about you and whom you accept too, and you will become close\nfriends with them. The remaining seven people will be neither of these types.” Now, do you\nfocus on the one person who dislikes you? Do you pay more attention to the two who love\nyou? Or would you focus on the crowd, the other seven? A person who is lacking in harmony\nof life will see only the one person he dislikes and will make a judgment of the world from\nthat.\nYOUTH: Intriguing.\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Some time ago, I participated in a workshop for people who stammer and\ntheir families. Do you know anyone who has a stammer?\nYOUTH: Yes, there was a student at the school I went to who stuttered. That must be hard to\ndeal with, both for the person who has it and for his family, too.\nPHILOSOPHER: Why is stammering hard to deal with? The view in Adlerian psychology is that\npeople who su\u0000er from stammering are concerned only about their own way of speaking,\nand they have feelings of inferiority and see their lives as unbearably hard. And they become\ntoo self-conscious as a result and start tripping over their words more and more.\nYOUTH: They are concerned only about their own way of speaking?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. There are not many people who will laugh at or make fun of\nsomeone when he trips over his words now and then. To use the example I just mentioned, it\nwould probably be no more than one person in ten, at most. In any case, with the sort of\nfoolish person who would take such an attitude, it is best to simply sever the relationship. But\nif one is lacking in harmony of life, one will focus only on that person and end up thinking,\nEveryone is laughing at me.\nYOUTH: But that’s just human nature!\nPHILOSOPHER: I have a reading group that meets on a regular basis, and one of the\nparticipants has a stammer. It comes out sometimes when it’s his turn to read. But not a\nsingle person there is the sort who would laugh at him for that. Everyone just sits quietly and\nwaits in a quite natural way for the next words to come out. I am sure this is not a\nphenomenon that is isolated to my reading group. When one’s interpersonal relations do not\ngo well, it cannot be blamed on a stammer or a fear of blushing or anything of the sort. Even\nthough the problem is really that one has not attained self-acceptance or con\u0000dence in others,\nor contribution to others, for that matter, one is focusing on only one tiny part of things that\nsimply should not matter and from that trying to form judgments with regard to the entire\nworld. This is a misguided lifestyle that is lacking in harmony of life.\nYOUTH: Did you actually convey such a harsh idea to people who su\u0000er from stammering?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course. At \u0000rst, there were some adverse reactions, but by the end of the\nthree-day workshop, everyone was in deep agreement with it.\nYOUTH: It certainly is a fascinating argument. But focusing on people who su\u0000er from\nstammering seems like a rather special example. Could you give me any others?"

    "raw_text": "PHILOSOPHER: Well, another would be the workaholic. This, too, is an example of a person\nwho is clearly lacking in harmony of life.\nYOUTH: A workaholic is? Why is that?\nPHILOSOPHER: People who su\u0000er from stammering are looking at only a part of things but\njudging the whole. With workaholics, the focus is solely on one speci\u0000c aspect of life.\nThey probably try to justify that by saying, “It’s busy at work, so I don’t have enough time\nto think about my family.” But this is a life-lie. They are simply trying to avoid their other\nresponsibilities by using work as an excuse. One ought to concern oneself with everything,\nfrom household chores and child-rearing to one’s friendships and hobbies and so on. Adler\ndoes not recognize ways of living in which certain aspects are unusually dominant.\nYOUTH: Ah . . . That’s exactly the sort of person my father was. It was just: Be a workaholic,\nbury yourself in your work, and produce results. And then rule over the family on the\ngrounds that you are the breadwinner. He was a very feudalistic person.\nPHILOSOPHER: In a sense, that is a way of living of refusing to acknowledge one’s life tasks.\n“Work” does not mean having a job at a company. Work in the home, child-rearing,\ncontributing to the local society, hobbies, and all manner of other things are work.\nCompanies and such are just one small part of that. A way of living that acknowledges only\ncompany work is one that is lacking in harmony of life.\nYOUTH: It’s exactly as you say! And it’s not as if the family he’s supporting has any say in the\nmatter, either. You can’t argue with your father when he growls with a violent tone of voice,\n“It’s thanks to me that there’s food on the table.”\nPHILOSOPHER: Such a father has probably been able to recognize his own worth only on the\nlevel of acts. He works all those hours, brings in enough money to support a family, and is\nrecognized by society—and, on that basis, he views himself as having greater worth than the\nother members of his family. For each and every one of us, however, there comes a time when\none can no longer serve as the provider. When one gets older and reaches retirement age, for\nexample, one may have no choice but to live o\u0000 one’s pension or support from one’s\nchildren. Even when one is young, injury or poor health can lead to being unable work any\nlonger. On such occasions, those who can accept themselves only on the level of acts are\nseverely damaged.\nYOUTH: You mean those people whose lifestyle is all about work?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. People whose lives lack harmony.\n\f\nYOUTH: In that case, I think I’m starting to get what you mean by the level of being, which\nyou brought up last time. And I certainly haven’t given much thought to the fact that\nsomeday I won’t be able to work any longer or do anything on the level of acts.\nPHILOSOPHER: Does one accept oneself on the level of acts, or on the level of being? This is\ntruly a question that relates to the courage to be happy.\n\f\nYou Can Be Happy Now\nYOUTH: The courage to be happy. Well, let’s hear what kind of courage that should be.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, that is an important point.\nYOUTH: You say that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. And then you turn\nthat around and say that our happiness is to be found in our interpersonal relations, too. But\nI still \u0000nd these aspects hard to accept. Is what human beings call happiness merely\nsomething within our good interpersonal relations? That is to say, do our lives exist for such\nminuscule repose and joy?\nPHILOSOPHER: I have a good idea of the issues you are grappling with. The \u0000rst time I\nattended a lecture on Adlerian psychology, the lecturer, Oscar Christensen, who was a\ndisciple of one of Adler’s disciples, made the following statement: “Those who hear my talk\ntoday can be happy right now, this very instant. But those who do not will never be able to be\nhappy.”\nYOUTH: Wow! That’s straight from the mouth of a con man. You’re not telling me you fell for\nthat, are you?\nPHILOSOPHER: What is happiness to human beings? This is a subject that has been one of the\nconsistent threads of philosophy since ancient times. I had always regarded psychology as\nnothing more than a \u0000eld of philosophy, and as such had very little interest in psychology as a\nwhole. So it was as a student of philosophy that I had concerned myself, in my own way, with\nthe question: What is happiness? I would be remiss if I did not admit to having felt some\nreluctance on hearing Christensen’s words. However, at the same time that I experienced that\nreluctance, I realized something. I had given much deep thought to the true character of\nhappiness. I had searched for answers. But I had not always given deep thought to the\nquestion: How can one be happy? It occurred to me then that even though I was a student of\nphilosophy, maybe I wasn’t happy.\nYOUTH: I see. So your \u0000rst encounter with Adlerian psychology began with a feeling of\nincongruity?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right.\nYOUTH: Then, please tell me: Did you eventually become happy?\nPHILOSOPHER: Of course.\nYOUTH: How can you be so sure?\nPHILOSOPHER: For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is not being able to like oneself.\nAdler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality. Namely, that the\nfeeling of “I am bene\u0000cial to the community” or “I am of use to someone” is the only thing\nthat can give one a true awareness that one has worth.\nYOUTH: Do you mean the “contribution to others” you mentioned earlier?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. And this is an important point: When we speak of contribution to others,\nit doesn’t matter if the contribution is not a visible one.\nYOUTH: It doesn’t matter if the contribution is not a visible one?\nPHILOSOPHER: You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use. That is the\ntask of other people, and is not an issue in which you can intervene. In principle, there is not\neven any way you can know whether you have really made a contribution. That is to say,\nwhen we are engaging in this contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a\nvisible one—all we need is the subjective sense that “I am of use to someone,” or in other\nwords, a feeling of contribution.\nYOUTH: Wait a minute! If that’s the case, then what you are calling happiness is . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Do you see it now? In a word, happiness is the feeling of contribution. That is\nthe de\u0000nition of happiness.\nYOUTH: But . . . but that’s . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: Is something wrong?\nYOUTH: There’s no way I can accept such a simplistic de\u0000nition. Look, I’m not forgetting\nwhat you told me before. You said that even though on the level of acts, one might not be of\nuse to anyone, on the level of being, every person is of use. But if that’s the case, according to\nyour logic, all human beings would be happy!\nPHILOSOPHER: All human beings can be happy. But it must be understood that this does not\nmean all human beings are happy. Whether it is on the level of acts or on the level of being,"

    "raw_text": "one needs to feel that one is of use to someone. That is to say, one needs a feeling of\ncontribution.\nYOUTH: So you are saying that the reason I am not happy is that I don’t have a feeling of\ncontribution?\nPHILOSOPHER: That is correct.\nYOUTH: Then how can I get a feeling of contribution? By working? Through volunteer\nactivities?\nPHILOSOPHER: Earlier, we were talking about desire for recognition. In response to my\nstatement that one must not seek recognition, you said that desire for recognition is a\nuniversal desire.\nYOUTH: Yes, I did. But honestly, I’m still not entirely certain about this point.\nPHILOSOPHER: But I am sure that the reason people seek recognition is clear to you now.\nPeople want to like themselves. They want to feel that they have worth. In order to feel that,\nthey want a feeling of contribution that tells them “I am of use to someone.” And they seek\nrecognition from others as an easy means for gaining that feeling of contribution.\nYOUTH: You are saying that desire for recognition is a means for gaining a feeling of\ncontribution?\nPHILOSOPHER: Isn’t it so?\nYOUTH: No way. That contradicts everything you’ve been saying until now. Because isn’t\nreceiving recognition from others supposed to be a means for gaining a feeling of\ncontribution? And then you say, “Happiness is the feeling of contribution.” If it is, then\nful\u0000lling one’s desire for recognition is directly linked with happiness, isn’t it? Ha-ha! At last,\nyou’ve acknowledged the necessity of the desire for recognition.\nPHILOSOPHER: You are forgetting an important issue. If one’s means for gaining a feeling of\ncontribution turns out to be “being recognized by others,” in the long run, one will have no\nchoice but to walk through life in accordance with other people’s wishes. There is no\nfreedom in a feeling of contribution that is gained through the desire for recognition. We are\nbeings who choose freedom while aspiring to happiness.\nYOUTH: So one can have happiness only if one has freedom?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. Freedom as an institution may di\u0000er depending on the country, the times,\nor the culture. But freedom in our interpersonal relations is universal.\nYOUTH: There’s no way that you will acknowledge the desire for recognition?\nPHILOSOPHER: If one really has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for\nrecognition from others. Because one will already have the real awareness that “I am of use to\nsomeone,” without needing to go out of one’s way to be acknowledged by others. In other\nwords, a person who is obsessed with the desire for recognition does not have any community\nfeeling yet, and has not managed to engage in self-acceptance, con\u0000dence in others, or\ncontribution to others.\nYOUTH: So if one just has community feeling, the desire for recognition will disappear?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it will disappear. There is no need for recognition from others.\nThe philosopher’s points could be summed up as follows: People can be truly aware\nof their worth only when they are able to feel “I am of use to someone.” However, it\ndoesn’t matter if the contribution one makes at such a time is without any visible\nform. It is enough to have the subjective sense of being of use to someone, that is to\nsay, a feeling of contribution. And then the philosopher arrives at the following\nconclusion: Happiness is the feeling of contribution. There certainly seemed to be\naspects of the truth there. But is that really all that happiness is? Not if it’s the\nhappiness I’m searching for!"

    "raw_text": "Two Paths Traveled by Those Wanting to Be\n“Special Beings”\nYOUTH: You still have not answered my question. Maybe I could actually learn to like myself\nthrough contribution to others. Maybe I could come to feel that I have worth, that I am not a\nworthless being. But is that all a person needs to be happy? Having come into this world, I\nthink that unless I am able to accomplish the sort of grand undertaking that future\ngenerations will remember me for, unless I can prove myself as “I, who am no one else but\nme,” I will never \u0000nd true happiness. You are trying to frame everything within interpersonal\nrelations without saying a thing about self-realizing happiness. If you ask me, that’s nothing\nbut evasion!\nPHILOSOPHER: I’m not really sure what you mean by “self-realizing happiness.” What exactly\nare you referring to?\nYOUTH: It’s something that is di\u0000erent for each person. I suppose there are those who want\nto succeed in society and those who have more personal objectives—a researcher endeavoring\nto develop a wonder drug, for instance, or an artist who strives to create a satisfying body of\nwork.\nPHILOSOPHER: What is it for you?\nYOUTH: I still don’t really know what I am looking for or what I’ll want to do in the future.\nBut I know that I’ve got to do something. There’s no way I’m going to spend the rest of my\ndays working in a university library. When I \u0000nd a dream that I can devote my life to, and I\nattain self-realization, that’s when I’ll experience true happiness. My father was someone who\nburied himself in his work from day to night, and I have no idea if that was happiness to him\nor not. To my eyes, at least, he seemed forever busy and never happy. That is not the kind of\nlife I want to lead.\nPHILOSOPHER: All right. If you think about this point using children who engage in problem\nbehavior as an example, it might be easier to grasp.\nYOUTH: Problem behavior?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. First of all, we human beings have a universal desire that is\nreferred to as “pursuit of superiority.” Do you recall our discussion of this?\nYOUTH: Yes. Simply put, it’s a term that indicates “hoping to improve” and “pursuing an\nideal state.”\nPHILOSOPHER: There are many children who, in their early stages, try to be especially good. In\nparticular, they obey their parents, comport themselves in a socially acceptable manner, apply\nthemselves assiduously to their studies and in sports, and excel in extracurricular activities as\nwell. In this way, they try to get their parents to acknowledge them. However, when being\nespecially good does not work out—their studies or sports don’t go well, for example—they\ndo an about-face and try to be especially bad.\nYOUTH: Why do they do that?\nPHILOSOPHER: Whether they are trying to be especially good, or trying to be especially bad,\nthe goal is the same: to attract the attention of other people, get out of the “normal”\ncondition and become a “special being.” That is their only goal.\nYOUTH: Hmm. All right, please go on.\nPHILOSOPHER: In any case, whether it is one’s studies or one’s participation in sports, either\nway one needs to make a constant e\u0000ort if one is to produce any kind of signi\u0000cant results.\nBut the children who try to be especially bad—that is to say, the ones who engage in problem\nbehavior—are endeavoring to attract the attention of other people even as they continue to\navoid any such healthy e\u0000ort. In Adlerian psychology, this is referred to as the “pursuit of easy\nsuperiority.” Take, for example, the problem child who disrupts lessons by throwing erasers\nor speaking in a loud voice. He is certain to get the attention of his friends and teachers. Even\nif it is something that is limited to that place, he will probably succeed in becoming a special\nbeing. But that is a pursuit of easy superiority, and it is an unhealthy attitude.\nYOUTH: So children who commit delinquent acts are engaging in the pursuit of easy\nsuperiority, too?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, they are. All types of problem behavior, from refusing to attend school, to\nwrist cutting, to underage drinking and smoking, and so on, are forms of the pursuit of easy\nsuperiority. And your shut-in friend, whom you told me about at the beginning, is engaging\nin it, too. When a child engages in problem behavior, his parents and other adults rebuke\nhim. Being rebuked, more than anything else, puts stress on the child. But even if it is in the\nform of rebuke, the child wants his parents’ attention. He wants to be a special being, and the\n\f\nform that attention takes doesn’t matter. So in a sense, it is only natural that he does not stop\nengaging in problem behavior, no matter how harshly he is rebuked.\nYOUTH: It’s because of their rebuking that he doesn’t stop the problem behavior?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Because the parents and other adults are giving him attention through\nthe act of rebuking.\nYOUTH: But previously, you spoke of the goal of problem behavior as being revenge on the\nparents, right? Does that connect with this in some way?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. “Revenge” and “pursuit of easy superiority” are easily linked. One makes\ntrouble for another person while trying at the same time to be “special.”"

    "raw_text": "The Courage to Be Normal\nYOUTH: But how . . . ? It would be impossible for all human beings to be especially good, or\nanything like that, wouldn’t it? No matter what, people have their strengths and weaknesses,\nand there will always be di\u0000erences. There’s only a handful of geniuses in the world, and not\neveryone is cut out to be an honors student. So for all the losers, there’s nothing for it besides\nbeing especially bad.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, it’s that Socratic paradox, that no one desires evil. Because to children\nwho engage in problem behavior, even violent acts and theft are accomplishments of “good.”\nYOUTH: But that’s horrible! That’s a line of reasoning with no way out.\nPHILOSOPHER: What Adlerian psychology emphasizes at this juncture are the words “the\ncourage to be normal.”\nYOUTH: The courage to be normal?\nPHILOSOPHER: Why is it necessary to be special? Probably because one cannot accept one’s\nnormal self. And it is precisely for this reason that when being especially good becomes a lost\ncause, one makes the huge leap to being especially bad—the opposite extreme. But is being\nnormal, being ordinary, really such a bad thing? Is it something inferior? Or, in truth, isn’t\neverybody normal? It is necessary to think this through to its logical conclusion.\nYOUTH: So are you saying that I should be normal?\nPHILOSOPHER: Self-acceptance is the vital \u0000rst step. If you are able to possess the courage to\nbe normal, your way of looking at the world will change dramatically.\nYOUTH: But . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: You are probably rejecting normality because you equate being normal with\nbeing incapable. Being normal is not being incapable. One does not need to \u0000aunt one’s\nsuperiority.\n\f\nYOUTH: Fine, I acknowledge the danger of aiming to be special. But does one really need to\nmake the deliberate choice to be normal? If I pass my time in this world in an utterly\nhumdrum way, if I lead a pointless life without leaving any record or memory of my existence\nwhatsoever, am I to just be satis\u0000ed with my lot, because that’s the sort of human being I am?\nYou’ve got to be joking. I’d abandon such a life in a second!\nPHILOSOPHER: You want to be special, no matter what?\nYOUTH: No! Look, accepting what you call “normal” would lead to me having to a\u0000rm my\nidle self! It would just be saying, “This is all I am capable of and that’s \u0000ne.” I refuse to accept\nsuch an idle way of life. Do you think that Napoleon or Alexander the Great or Einstein or\nMartin Luther King accepted “normal”? And how about Socrates and Plato? Not a chance!\nMore than likely, they all lived their lives while carrying the torch of a great ideal or objective.\nAnother Napoleon could never emerge with your line of reasoning. You are trying to rid the\nworld of geniuses!\nPHILOSOPHER: So what you are saying is that one needs lofty goals in life.\nYOUTH: But that’s obvious!\n“The courage to be normal”—what truly dreadful words. Are Adler and this\nphilosopher really telling me to choose such a path? To go about my life as just another\nsoul among the utterly ordinary, faceless masses? I’m no genius, of course. Maybe\n“normal” is the only choice I have. Maybe I will just have to accept my mediocre self and\nsurrender to leading a mediocre, everyday existence. But I will ﬁght it. Whatever\nhappens, I will oppose this man to the bitter end. We seem to be approaching the heart of\nour discussion. The young man’s pulse was racing, and despite the wintry chill in the\nair, his clenched \u0000sts shone with sweat.\n\f\nLife Is a Series of Moments\nPHILOSOPHER: All right. When you speak of lofty goals, I am guessing that you have an image\nof something like a mountain climber aiming for the top.\nYOUTH: Yes, that’s right. People, myself included, aim for the top of the mountain.\nPHILOSOPHER: But if life were climbing a mountain in order to reach the top, then the greater\npart of life would end up being “en route.” That is to say, one’s “real life” would begin with\none’s trek on the mountainside, and the distance one has traveled up until that point would\nbe a “tentative life” led by a “tentative me.”\nYOUTH: I guess that’s one way of putting it. The way I am now, I am de\u0000nitely an “en route”\nperson.\nPHILOSOPHER: Now, suppose you didn’t make it to the mountaintop, what would that mean\nfor your life? With accidents and diseases and the like, people don’t always make it all the way,\nand mountain climbing itself is fraught with pitfalls and often ends in failure. So one’s life\nwould be interrupted “en route,” with just this “tentative me” leading a “tentative life.” What\nkind of life would that be?\nYOUTH: That’s . . . Well, that’d be a case of getting one’s just deserts. So I didn’t have the\nability, or I didn’t have the physical strength to climb a mountain, or I wasn’t lucky, or I\nlacked the skill—that’s all! Yes, that is a reality I am prepared to accept.\nPHILOSOPHER: Adlerian psychology has a di\u0000erent standpoint. People who think of life as\nbeing like climbing a mountain are treating their own existences as lines. As if there is a line\nthat started the instant one came into this world, and that continues in all manner of curves\nof varying sizes until it arrives at the summit, and then at long last reaches its terminus, which\nis death. This conception, which treats life as a kind of story, is an idea that links with\nFreudian etiology (the attributing of causes), and is a way of thinking that makes the greater\npart of life into something that is “en route.”\nYOUTH: Well, what is your image of life?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Do not treat it as a line. Think of life as a series of dots. If you look through a\nmagnifying glass at a solid line drawn with chalk, you will discover that what you thought\nwas a line is actually a series of small dots. Seemingly linear existence is actually a series of\ndots; in other words, life is a series of moments.\nYOUTH: A series of moments?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. It is a series of moments called “now.” We can live only in the here and\nnow. Our lives exist only in moments. Adults who do not know this attempt to impose\n“linear” lives onto young people. Their thinking is that staying on the conventional tracks—\ngood university, big company, stable household—is a happy life. But life is not made up of\nlines or anything like that.\nYOUTH: So there’s no need for life planning or career planning?\nPHILOSOPHER: If life were a line, then life planning would be possible. But our lives are only a\nseries of dots. A well-planned life is not something to be treated as necessary or unnecessary,\nas it is impossible.\nYOUTH: Oh, nonsense! What an absurd idea!\n\f\nLive Like You’re Dancing\nPHILOSOPHER: What is wrong with it?\nYOUTH: Your argument not only denies the making of plans in life, it goes as far as to deny\neven making e\u0000orts. Take, for example, the life of someone who has dreamed of being a\nviolinist ever since childhood, and who, after years of strict training, has at long last become\nan active member in a celebrated orchestra. Or another life, one of intensive studies that\nsuccessfully leads to the passing of the bar examination and becoming a lawyer. Neither of\nthese lives would be possible without objectives and plans.\nPHILOSOPHER: So in other words, like mountain climbers aiming to reach the mountaintop,\nthey have persevered on their paths?\nYOUTH: Of course!\nPHILOSOPHER: But is that really the case? Isn’t it that these people have lived each and every\ninstant of their lives here and now? That is to say, rather than living lives that are “en route,”\nthey are always living here and now. For example, the person who had dreams of becoming a\nviolinist was always looking at pieces of music, and concentrating on each piece, and on each\nand every measure and note.\nYOUTH: Would they attain their objectives that way?\nPHILOSOPHER: Think of it this way: Life is a series of moments, which one lives as if one were\ndancing, right now, around and around each passing instant. And when one happens to\nsurvey one’s surroundings, one realizes, I guess I’ve made it this far. Among those who have\ndanced the dance of the violin, there are people who stay the course and become professional\nmusicians. Among those who have danced the dance of the bar examination, there are people\nwho become lawyers. There are people who have danced the dance of writing and become\nauthors. Of course, it also happens that people end up in entirely di\u0000erent places. But none\nof these lives came to an end “en route.” It is enough if one \u0000nds ful\u0000llment in the here and\nnow one is dancing.\nYOUTH: It’s enough if one can dance in the now?\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. With dance, it is the dancing itself that is the goal, and no one is\nconcerned with arriving somewhere by doing it. Naturally, it may happen that one arrives\nsomewhere as a result of having danced. Since one is dancing, one does not stay in the same\nplace. But there is no destination.\nYOUTH: A life without a destination, who ever heard of such a thing? Who would\nacknowledge such an unsteady life, that bends whichever way the wind blows?\nPHILOSOPHER: The kind of life that you speak of, which tries to reach a destination, may be\ntermed a “kinetic (dynamic) life.” By contrast, the kind of dancing life I am talking about\ncould be called an “energeial (actual-active-state) life.”\nYOUTH: Kinetic? Energeial?\nPHILOSOPHER: Let’s refer to Aristotle’s explanation. Ordinary motion—which is referred to\nas kinesis—has a starting point and an end point. The movement from the starting point to\nthe end point is optimal if it is carried out as e\u0000ciently and as quickly as possible. If one can\ntake an express train, there is no need to ride the local one that makes every stop.\nYOUTH: In other words, if one’s destination is to become a lawyer, it’s best to get there as\nquickly and as e\u0000ciently as one can.\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. And the road one takes to get to that destination is, in the sense that one’s\ngoal has not yet been reached, incomplete. This is kinetic life.\nYOUTH: Because it’s halfway?\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Energeia, on the other hand, is a kind of movement in which\nwhat is “now forming” is what “has been formed.”\nYOUTH: What is “now forming” is what “has been formed”?\nPHILOSOPHER: One might also think of it as movement in which the process itself is treated as\nthe outcome. Dance is like that, and so is a journey.\nYOUTH: Ah, I’m getting confused . . . What is this about a journey?\nPHILOSOPHER: What kind of goal is the act of going on a journey? Suppose you are going on\na journey to Egypt. Would you try to arrive at the Great Pyramid of Giza as e\u0000ciently and\nquickly as possible, and then head straight back home by the shortest route? One would not\ncall that a “journey.” You should be on a journey the moment you step outside your home,\nand all the moments on the way to your destination should be a journey. Of course, there\n\f\nmight be circumstances that prevent you from making it to the pyramid, but that does not\nmean you didn’t go on a journey. This is “energeial life.”\nYOUTH: I guess I’m just not getting this. Weren’t you refuting the kind of value system of\naiming for the mountaintop? What happens if you liken energeial life to mountain climbing?\nPHILOSOPHER: If the goal of climbing a mountain were to get to the top, that would be a\nkinetic act. To take it to the extreme, it wouldn’t matter if you went to the mountaintop in a\nhelicopter, stayed there for \u0000ve minutes or so, and then headed back in the helicopter again.\nOf course, if you didn’t make it to the mountaintop, that would mean the mountain-\nclimbing expedition was a failure. However, if the goal is mountain climbing itself, and not\njust getting to the top, one could say it is energeial. In this case, in the end it doesn’t matter\nwhether one makes it to the mountaintop or not.\nYOUTH: That sort of argument is just ridiculous! You’ve fallen into a completely self-defeating\ncontradiction. Before you lose face before the whole wide world, I’ll cut through your\nshameless nonsense, once and for all.\nPHILOSOPHER: Oh, I’d be much obliged.\n\f\nShine a Light on the Here and Now\nYOUTH: Look, in your refutation of etiology, you rejected focusing on the past. You said that\nthe past does not exist, and that it has no meaning. I acknowledge those points. It is true that\none cannot change the past. If there is something that can be changed, it is the future. But\nnow, by advocating this energeial way of living, you are refuting planning; that is to say, you\nare rejecting even changing one’s future of one’s own volition. So while you reject looking\nback, you are rejecting looking forward, too. It’s like you’re telling me to just walk\nblindfolded along a pathless path.\nPHILOSOPHER: You can see neither behind you nor in front of you?\nYOUTH: That’s right, I can’t see!\nPHILOSOPHER: Isn’t that only natural? Where is the problem here?\nYOUTH: What? What are you talking about?\nPHILOSOPHER: Imagine that you are standing on a theater stage. If the house lights are on,\nyou’ll probably be able to see all the way to the back of the hall. But if you’re under a bright\nspotlight, you won’t be able to make out even the front row. That’s exactly how it is with our\nlives. It’s because we cast a dim light on our entire lives that we are able to see the past and the\nfuture. Or at least we imagine we can. But if one is shining a bright spotlight on here and\nnow, one cannot see the past or the future anymore.\nYOUTH: A bright spotlight?\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes. We should live more earnestly only here and now. The fact that you think\nyou can see the past, or predict the future, is proof that rather than living earnestly here and\nnow, you are living in a dim twilight. Life is a series of moments, and neither the past nor the\nfuture exists. You are trying to give yourself a way out by focusing on the past and the future.\nWhat happened in the past has nothing whatsoever to do with your here and now, and what\nthe future may hold is not a matter to think about here and now. If you are living earnestly\nhere and now, you will not be concerned with such things.\nYOUTH: But . . .\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: When one adopts the point of view of Freudian etiology, one sees life as a kind\nof great big story based on cause and e\u0000ect. So then it’s all about where and when I was born,\nwhat my childhood was like, the school I attended and the company where I got a job. And\nthat decides who I am now and who I will become. To be sure, likening one’s life to a story is\nprobably an entertaining job. The problem is, one can see the dimness that lies ahead at the\nend of the story. Moreover, one will try to lead a life that is in line with that story. And then\none says, “My life is such-and-such, so I have no choice but to live this way, and it’s not\nbecause of me—it’s my past, it’s the environment,” and so on. But bringing up the past here\nis nothing but a way out, a life-lie. However, life is a series of dots, a series of moments. If you\ncan grasp that, you will not need a story any longer.\nYOUTH: If you put it that way, the lifestyle that Adler is advocating is a kind of story, too.\nPHILOSOPHER: Lifestyle is about here and now, and is something that one can change of one’s\nown volition. The life of the past that looks like a straight line appears that way to you only as\na result of your making ceaseless resolutions to not change. The life that lies ahead of you is a\ncompletely blank page, and there are no tracks that have been laid for you to follow. There is\nno story there.\nYOUTH: But that’s just living for the moment. Or worse, a vicious hedonism!\nPHILOSOPHER: No. To shine a spotlight on here and now is to go about doing what one can\ndo now, earnestly and conscientiously.\n\f\nThe Greatest Life-Lie\nYOUTH: To live earnestly and conscientiously?\nPHILOSOPHER: For example, one wants to get into a university but makes no attempt to\nstudy. This an attitude of not living earnestly here and now. Of course, maybe the entrance\nexamination is still far o\u0000. Maybe one is not sure what needs to be studied or how\nthoroughly, and one \u0000nds it troublesome. However, it is enough to do it little by little—every\nday one can work out some mathematical formulas, one can memorize some words. In short,\none can dance the dance. By doing so, one is sure to have a sense of “this is what I did today”;\nthis is what today, this single day, was for. Clearly, today is not for an entrance examination in\nthe distant future. And the same thing would hold true for your father, too—he was likely\ndancing earnestly the dance of his everyday work. He lived earnestly here and now, without\nhaving a grand objective or the need to achieve that objective. And, if that was the case, it\nwould seem that your father’s life was a happy one.\nYOUTH: Are you telling me to a\u0000rm that way of living? That I should accept my father’s\nconstantly work-burdened existence . . . ?\nPHILOSOPHER: There is no need to make yourself a\u0000rm it. Only instead of seeing his life as a\nline that he reached, start seeing how he lived it, see the moments of his life.\nYOUTH: The moments.\nPHILOSOPHER: And the same may be said with regard to your own life. You set objectives for\nthe distant future, and think of now as your preparatory period. You think, I really want to\ndo this, and I’ll do it when the time comes. This is a way of living that postpones life. As long as\nwe postpone life, we can never go anywhere and will pass our days only one after the next in\ndull monotony, because we think of here and now as just a preparatory period, as a time for\npatience. But a “here and now” in which one is studying for an entrance examination in the\ndistant future, for example, is the real thing.\nYOUTH: Okay, I’ll accept that. I can certainly accept living earnestly here and now, and not\nsetting up some fabricated line. But I don’t have any dreams or objectives in my life. I don’t\nknow what dance to do. My here and now is nothing but utterly useless moments."

    "raw_text": "PHILOSOPHER: Not having objectives or the like is \u0000ne. Living earnestly here and now is itself\na dance. One must not get too serious. Please do not confuse being earnest with being too\nserious.\nYOUTH: Be earnest but not too serious.\nPHILOSOPHER: That’s right. Life is always simple, not something that one needs to get too\nserious about. If one is living each moment earnestly, there is no need to get too serious.\nAnd there is another thing I would like you to keep in mind: When one has adopted an\nenergeial viewpoint, life is always complete.\nYOUTH: It’s complete?\nPHILOSOPHER: If your life, or mine, for that matter, were to come to an end here and now, it\nwould not do to refer to either of them as unhappy. The life that ends at the age of twenty\nand the life that ends at ninety are both complete lives, and lives of happiness.\nYOUTH: So if I have lived earnestly here and now, those moments will always be complete?\nPHILOSOPHER: Exactly. Now, I have used the word “life-lie” again and again throughout our\ndiscussion. I would like to conclude by talking about the greatest life-lie of all.\nYOUTH: Please do.\nPHILOSOPHER: The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past\nand the future, cast a dim light on one’s entire life, and believe that one has been able to see\nsomething. Until now, you have turned away from the here and now and shone a light only\non invented pasts and futures. You have told a great lie to your life, to these irreplaceable\nmoments.\nYOUTH: Oh, okay!\nPHILOSOPHER: So cast away the life-lie and fearlessly shine a bright spotlight on here and now.\nThat is something you can do.\nYOUTH: That is something I can do? Do you think I have in me the courage to live out these\nmoments earnestly, without resorting to the life-lie?\nPHILOSOPHER: Since neither the past nor the future exists, let’s talk about now.

    "raw_text": "Give Meaning to Seemingly Meaningless Life\nYOUTH: What are you saying?\nPHILOSOPHER: I think this discussion has now reached the water’s edge. Whether you drink\nthe water or not is entirely up to you.\nYOUTH: Ah, maybe Adlerian psychology, and your philosophy, are actually changing me.\nMaybe I am trying to let go of my resolve not to change, and choose a new way of living, a\nnew lifestyle . . . But wait, there is one last thing I’d like to ask.\nPHILOSOPHER: And what would that be?\nYOUTH: When life is taken as a series of moments, as existing only here and now, what\nmeaning could it possibly have? For what was I born, and for what am I enduring this life of\nhardship until I reach my last gasp? The point of it all is beyond me.\nPHILOSOPHER: What is the meaning of life? What are people living for? When someone posed\nthese questions to Adler, this was his answer: “Life in general has no meaning.”\nYOUTH: Life is meaningless?\nPHILOSOPHER: The world in which we live is constantly beset by all manner of horrendous\nevents, and we exist with the ravages of war and natural disasters all around us. When\nconfronted by the fact of children dying in the turmoil of war, there is no way one can go on\nabout the meaning of life. In other words, there is no meaning in using generalizations to talk\nabout life. But being confronted by such incomprehensible tragedies without taking any\naction is tantamount to a\u0000rming them. Regardless of the circumstances, we must take some\nform of action. We must stand up to Kant’s “inclination.”\nYOUTH: Yes!\nPHILOSOPHER: Now, suppose one experiences a major natural disaster, and one’s response is\nto look back at the past in an etiological manner and say, “What could have caused such a\nthing to happen?” How meaningful would that be? An experience of hardship should be an\nopportunity to look ahead and think, What can I do from now on?\n\f\nYOUTH: I agree entirely!\nPHILOSOPHER: And Adler, having stated that “life in general has no meaning,” then\ncontinues, “Whatever meaning life has must be assigned to it by the individual.”\nYOUTH: Assigned to it by the individual? What does that mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: During the war, my grandfather was \u0000rebombed, and his face was severely\nburned. In every way, it was a horrendous and inhumane event. It would certainly have been\nwithin the realm of possibility for him to choose a lifestyle with the perspective of “the world\nis a horrible place” or “people are my enemies.” However, when my grandfather rode the\ntrain on visits to the hospital, there were always other passengers who would give up their\nseats for him. This is something I heard about through my mother, so I do not know how he\nactually felt. But this is what I believe: My grandfather chose a lifestyle with the perspective of\n“People are my comrades, and the world is a wonderful place.” That is exactly what Adler is\npointing to when he says whatever meaning life has must be assigned to it by the individual.\nSo life in general has no meaning whatsoever. But you can assign meaning to that life. And\nyou are the only one who can assign meaning to your life.\nYOUTH: Then, please tell me! How can I assign proper meaning to a meaningless life? I do not\nhave the con\u0000dence yet!\nPHILOSOPHER: You are lost in your life. Why are you lost? You are lost because you are trying\nto choose freedom, that is to say, a path on which you are not afraid of being disliked by\nothers and you are not living others’ lives—a path that is yours alone.\nYOUTH: That’s right! I want to choose happiness, and choose freedom!\nPHILOSOPHER: When one attempts to choose freedom, it is only natural that one may lose\none’s way. At this juncture, Adlerian psychology holds up a “guiding star” as a grand compass\npointing to a life of freedom.\nYOUTH: A guiding star?\nPHILOSOPHER: Just like the traveler who relies on the North Star, in our lives we need a\nguiding star. That is the Adlerian psychology way of thinking. It is an expansive ideal that\nsays, as long as we do not lose sight of this compass and keep on moving in this direction,\nthere is happiness.\nYOUTH: Where is that star?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is contribution to others.\n\f\nYOUTH: Huh? Contribution to others!\nPHILOSOPHER: No matter what moments you are living, or if there are people who dislike\nyou, as long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of “I contribute to others,” you will\nnot lose your way, and you can do whatever you like. Whether you’re disliked or not, you pay\nit no mind and live free.\nYOUTH: If I have the star of contribution to others high in the sky above me, I will always\nhave happiness and comrades by my side.\nPHILOSOPHER: Then, let’s dance in earnest the moments of the here and now, and live in\nearnest. Do not look at the past, and do not look at the future. One lives each complete\nmoment like a dance. There is no need to compete with anyone, and one has no use for\ndestinations. As long as you are dancing, you will get somewhere.\nYOUTH: A “somewhere” that no one else knows!\nPHILOSOPHER: That is the nature of energeial life. If I look back on my own life up to now, no\nmatter how I try, I will never arrive at a satisfactory explanation as to why I am here and now.\nThough, at one time, the study of Greek philosophy was my focus, before long I took up the\nstudy of Adlerian psychology in tandem with it, and here I am today, deep in conversation\nwith you, my irreplaceable friend. It is the result of having danced the moments—that is the\nonly way to explain it. When you have danced here and now in earnest and to the full, that is\nwhen the meaning of your life will become clear to you.\nYOUTH: It will? I . . . I believe you!\nPHILOSOPHER: Yes, please believe. Through my many years living with Adler’s thought, there\nis something I have noticed.\nYOUTH: And that is?\nPHILOSOPHER: It is that the power of one person is great, or, rather, “my power is\nimmeasurably great.”\nYOUTH: What do you mean?\nPHILOSOPHER: Well, in other words, if “I” change, the world will change. This means that the\nworld can be changed only by me and no one else will change it for me. The world that has\nappeared to me since learning of Adlerian psychology is not the world I once knew.\nYOUTH: If I change, the world will change. No one else will change the world for me . . .\n\f\nPHILOSOPHER: It is similar to the shock experienced by someone who, after many years of\nbeing nearsighted, puts on glasses for the \u0000rst time. Previously indistinct outlines of the\nworld become well de\u0000ned, and even the colors are more vivid. Furthermore, it is not only a\npart of one’s visual \u0000eld that becomes clear but also the entire visible world. I can only\nimagine how happy you will be if you have a similar experience.\nYOUTH: Ah, if only I’d known! I wish I had known this ten years ago, or even just \u0000ve years\nago. If only I had known \u0000ve years ago, before I got a job . . .\nPHILOSOPHER: No, that is not the case. You say you wish you had known this ten years ago. It\nis because Adler’s thought resonates with you now that you are thinking this. No one knows\nhow you would have felt about it ten years ago. This discussion was something that you\nneeded to hear now.\nYOUTH: Yes, I certainly did!\nPHILOSOPHER: One more time, I give you the words of Adler: “Someone has to start. Other\npeople might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: You\nshould start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.”\nYOUTH: I cannot tell yet if it is I who have changed, or if it is the world that I can see from\nthat vantage point that has changed. But there is one thing I can say with conviction: Here\nand now is shining brightly! Yes, it is so bright that I can see almost nothing of tomorrow.\nPHILOSOPHER: I believe that you have drunk the water. So young friend who walks ahead,\nshall we walk together?\nYOUTH: I believe you, too. Yes, let’s walk together. And thank you for all your time.\nPHILOSOPHER: Thank you, too.\nYOUTH: I hope you will not mind if, at some point, I visit you here again. Yes, as an\nirreplaceable friend. And I won’t be saying anything more about taking apart your\narguments.\nPHILOSOPHER: Ha-ha! At last, you have shown me a young person’s smile. Well, it’s quite late\nalready. Let’s pass our own nights, and greet the new morning.\nThe young man slowly tied his shoelaces and left the philosopher’s house. On\nopening the door, he found a snowy scene spread out before him.

    "raw_text": "Afterword\nIn life, there are encounters in which a book one happens to pick up one day ends up\ncompletely altering one’s landscape the following morning.\nIt was the winter of 1999, and I was a youth in my twenties, when I had the great fortune\nof encountering such a book at a bookshop in Ikebukuro. This was Ichiro Kishimi’s Adorā\nShinrigaku Nyūmon (Introduction to Adlerian Psychology).\nHere was a form of thought, profound in every way, yet conveyed in simple language, that\nseemed to overturn our accepted wisdoms at their very roots. A Copernican revolution that\ndenied trauma and converted etiology into teleology. Having always felt something\nunconvincing in the discourses of the Freudians and Jungians, I was a\u0000ected very deeply.\nWho was this Alfred Adler? How had I never known of his existence before? I purchased\nevery single book by or about Adler that I could get my hands on and became completely\nengrossed and read them over and over again.\nBut I was struck then by a certain fact. What I was interested in was not solely Adlerian\npsychology but rather something that had emerged through the \u0000lter of the philosopher,\nIchiro Kishimi: It was Kishimi-Adler studies that I was seeking.\nGrounded in the thought of Socrates and Plato and other ancient Greek philosophers, the\nAdlerian psychology that Kishimi conveys to us reveals Adler as a thinker, a philosopher,\nwhose work went far beyond the con\u0000nes of clinical psychology. For instance, the statement\n“It is only in social contexts that a person becomes an individual” is positively Hegelian; in his\nlaying emphasis on subjective interpretation over objective truth, he echoes Nietzsche’s\nworldview; and ideas recalling the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger are in\nabundance.\nAdlerian psychology, which draws inspiration from these philosophical insights to\nproclaim “All problems are interpersonal relationship problems,” “People can change and be\nhappy from this moment onward,” and “The problem is not one of ability, but of courage”\nwas to utterly change the worldview of this rather confused youth.\nNevertheless, there was almost no one around me who had heard of Adlerian psychology.\nEventually, it occurred to me that I would like to make a book some day with Kishimi that\nwould be a de\u0000nitive edition of Adlerian psychology (Kishimi-Adler studies), and I contacted\none editor after another and waited impatiently for the opportunity to arise.\nIt was in March 2010 that I was at last able to meet with Kishimi, who lives in Kyoto.\nMore than ten years had passed since my \u0000rst reading of Introduction to Adlerian Psychology.\n\f\nWhen Kishimi said to me then, “Socrates’s thought was conveyed by Plato. I would like to\nbe a Plato for Adler,” without a second thought, I answered, “Then, I will be a Plato for you,\nMr. Kishimi.” And that is how this book was conceived.\nOne aspect of Adler’s simple and universal ideas is that there are times when he may seem\nto be stating the obvious, while at others he is likely to be regarded as espousing utterly\nunrealizable, idealistic theories.\nAccordingly, in this book, in hopes of focusing on any doubts that might be harbored by\nthe reader, I have adopted the format of a dialogue between a philosopher and a young man.\nAs is implied in this narrative, it is not a simple thing to make the ideas of Adler one’s own\nand put them into practice. There are points that make one want to rebel, statements that are\ndi\u0000cult to accept, and proposals that one may struggle to grasp.\nBut the ideas of Adler have the power to completely change a person’s life, just like they\ndid for me over a decade ago. Then it is only a question of having the courage to take a step\nforward.\nIn closing, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Ichiro Kishimi, who never treated\nme as a disciple, even though I was much younger than he, but met me forthrightly as a\nfriend; to the editor Yoshifumi Kakiuchi, for his steadfast and unstinting support at every\nstep of the way; and last but not least, to all the readers of this book.\nThank you very much.\nFumitake Koga\nMore than half a century has passed since the death of Adler, and the times still cannot catch\nup with the freshness of his ideas. Though compared to Freud or Jung, the name Adler is\nlittle known in Japan today. Adler’s teachings are said to be a “communal quarry” that\nanyone can excavate something from. And though his name often goes unmentioned, the\nin\u0000uence of his teachings has spread far and wide.\nI had been studying philosophy ever since my late teens, and it was around the time my\nchild was born, when I was in my early thirties, that I \u0000rst encountered Adlerian psychology.\nEudaimonic theory, which investigates the question “What is happiness?,” is one of the\ncentral themes of Western philosophy. I had spent many years pondering this question before\nI attended the lecture where I \u0000rst learned of Adlerian psychology. On hearing the lecturer\ndeclare from his podium, “Those who have listened to my talk today will be able to change\nand be happy from this moment onward,” I felt repulsed. But at the same time, it dawned on\nme that I had never thought deeply about how I myself can \u0000nd happiness, and with the\nnotion that “\u0000nding happiness” itself was perhaps easier than I’d imagined, I took an interest\nin Adlerian psychology.\nIn this way, I came to study Adlerian psychology side by side with philosophy. I soon\nrealized, however, that I could not study them separately, as two distinct \u0000elds.\n\f\nFor instance, the idea of teleology, far from being something that appeared suddenly in\nAdler’s time, is present in the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. It became clear to me that\nAdlerian psychology was a way of thinking that lay in the same vein as Greek philosophy.\nMoreover, I noticed that the dialogues that Socrates engaged in with youths, which Plato\nrecording in writing for posterity, could be said to correspond very closely to the counseling\npracticed today.\nThough many people think of philosophy as something di\u0000cult to understand, Plato’s\ndialogues do not contain any specialized language.\nIt is strange that philosophy should be something that is discussed using words\nunderstood only by specialists. Because in its original meaning, philosophy refers not to\n“wisdom” itself but to “love of wisdom,” and it is the very process of learning what one does\nnot know and arriving at wisdom that is important.\nWhether or not one attains wisdom in the end is not an issue.\nA person reading Plato’s dialogues today may be surprised to \u0000nd that the dialogue\nconcerning courage, for instance, ends without arriving at any conclusion.\nThe youths engaged in dialogues with Socrates never agree with what he says at the outset.\nThey refute his statements thoroughly. This book is continuing in the tradition of\nphilosophy since Socrates, and that is why it follows the format of a dialogue between a\nphilosopher and a youth.\nUpon learning of Adlerian psychology, which is another philosophy, I became dissatis\u0000ed\nwith the way of living of the researcher who only reads and interprets the writings of his\npredecessors. I wanted to engage in dialogues in the way that Socrates did, and eventually I\nbegan to practice counseling at psychiatry clinics and other venues.\nIn doing so, I met many youths.\nAll of these youths wanted to live sincerely, but many of them were people who had been\ntold by worldly, jaded elders to “be more realistic” and were on the verge of giving up on their\ndreams, people who had been through arduous experiences of being entangled in\ninterpersonal relationships that were complicated precisely because they were pure.\nWanting to live sincerely is an important thing, but it is not enough on its own. Adler tells\nus that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. But if one does not know how\nto build good interpersonal relationships, one may end up trying to satisfy other people’s\nexpectations. And unable to communicate out of fear of hurting other people even when one\nhas something to assert, one may end up abandoning what one really wants to do.\nWhile people may certainly be popular among those they know, and not many people will\ndislike them perhaps, they will end up being incapable of living their own lives.\nTo a young person like the youth in this book, who has many problems and has already\nhad a harsh awakening to reality, the views put forward by this philosopher, that this world is\na simple place and that anyone can be happy from this day onward, may come as a surprise.\n“My psychology is for all people,” says Adler, and dispensing with specialized language\nmuch as Plato did, he shows us speci\u0000c steps for improving our interpersonal relationships.\n\f\nIf Adler’s way of thinking is hard to accept, it is because it is a compilation of antitheses to\nnormal social thinking, and because to understand it one must put it into practice in\neveryday life. Though his words are not di\u0000cult, there may be a sense of di\u0000culty like that of\nimagining the blazing heat of summer in the dead of winter, but I hope that readers will be\nable to grasp keys here to solving their interpersonal relationship problems.\nThe day Fumitake Koga, my collaborator and writer for this book, \u0000rst visited my study,\nhe said, “I will be a Plato for you, Mr. Kishimi.”\nToday the reason we can learn about the philosophy of Socrates, who left no known\nwritings, is that Plato took down his dialogues in written form. But Plato did not simply\nrecord what Socrates said. It is thanks to Plato’s correct understanding of his words that\nSocrates’s teachings are still conveyed today.\nIt is thanks to the exceptional powers of understanding of Koga, who persisted in carrying\nout repeated dialogues with me over a period of several years, that this book has seen the light\nof day. Both Koga and I often made visits to our teachers in our university days, and the\nyouth in this book could be either one of us, but more than anyone, he is you, who picked up\nthis book. It is my sincere hope that while your doubts may linger, I will be able to support\nyour resolution in all manner of life situations through this dialogue with a philosopher.\nIchiro Kishimi"

    "raw_text": "The Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga\nThis reading group guide for The Courage to Be Disliked includes an introduction, discussion\nquestions, and ideas for enhancing your book club. The suggested questions are intended to help\nyour reading group ﬁnd new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that\nthese ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.\nIntroduction\nThe Courage to Be Disliked follows a conversation between a young man and a philosopher as\nthey discuss the tenets of Alfred Adler’s theories. Alder, a lesser-known twentieth-century\npsychologist whose work stands up to Freud and Jung, believes in a liberating approach to\nhappiness in which each human being has the power and potential to live a happy and\nful\u0000lled life without worry about the past or future. Their dialogue spans \u0000ve nights, and the\nreader is invited to journey alongside the youth as he grapples with, \u0000ghts against, and is\nultimately moved by the profundity of Alder’s wisdom.\nTopics & Questions for Discussion\nThe First Night: Deny Trauma\n1.  Like the youth, do you feel determined from the outset to reject the philosopher’s\ntheories? Why might that be?\n2. “Everyone wishes they could change,” the youth says. Do you agree? If you could change\none thing about yourself, what would it be and why?\n3. What “equipment” do you possess? Assess how successfully, on a scale from 1–10, you\nare using your equipment to bring happiness to your life in this moment?\nThe Second Night: All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship Problems\n4. Do you \u0000nd it comforting to hear that it is “basically impossible to not get hurt in your\nrelations with other people”? Why or why not?\n5. Describe a time when your own feeling of inferiority acted as a kind of launchpad to\nchange or move forward in your life.\n6. Do you agree that love is the most di\u0000cult life-task? Why do you think so?\n\f\nThe Third Night: Discard Other People’s\n7. Answer the philosopher’s question: why does one want to be praised by others? (page\n116)\n8. The philosopher o\u0000ers the following de\u0000nition of freedom: “Freedom is being disliked by\nother people.” How would you de\u0000ne freedom?\n9. Do you have the courage to be disliked? Or do you know anyone in your life who seems\nto? If so, do their relationships or yours seem “things of lightness” as the philosopher\nsuggests?\nThe Fourth Night: Where the Center of the World Is\n10. From where in your life do you derive a sense of community feeling?\n11. Is your life worth living because you are of use to someone? Consider how we manifest\nthis worth—think of the jobs we take, the places we chose to live, or the experiences we\naccept or decline.\n12. The philosopher o\u0000ers the youth the same advice Adler o\u0000ered once: “someone has to\nstart.” That is, to create a meaningful life, a sense of community, it must begin with you\nregardless of what others around you are doing. How practical do you \u0000nd this advice?\nWhat are concrete ways you might begin to “start”?\nThe Fourth Night: Where the Center of the World Is\n13. Were you surprised, comforted, and/or fascinated to read that “there is no such thing as a\n100 percent person”? How can you actively acknowledge this fact to yourself, as the\nphilosopher suggests?\n14. Labor is one way we come to feel useful and worthwhile, and therefore happy. What\naspects of your work give you a sense of ful\u0000llment? Do some aspects of your labor\ndetract from your happiness?\n15. Share how you plan to cast a spotlight on the here and now. What sort of action plan can\nyou make to focus on living in the present moment?\nEnhance Your Book Club\n1. The Courage to be Disliked is a book that instructs readers how to have the courage to live\na happy, authentic life. All of the advice of the philosopher hinges on retraining your\nmind to accept yourself as you are, and in turn to accept others as they are. In order to\nhelp declutter your mind, spend some time in meditation with your book club. Turn\nthe lights down and sit in a circle. Together, practice relaxation techniques, including\nbreathing in deeply through your nose and out through your mouth. Visualize your\nentire body \u0000lling with air and then emptying out completely. In the background, play\nsome relaxing music or ocean sounds. Feel yourself relax and prepare to discuss the\nconcepts you \u0000nd most challenging in the book.\n\f\n2. The structure of The Courage to be Disliked is inspired by Socratic dialogue, a literary\ngenre derived from Plato’s dialogues in which Socrates is a main character who, through\nconversation, seeks to answer questions on the meaning of life. Participate in your own\nversion of this ancient quest for discovering truth. Have your book club perform a\nSocratic circle. Come up with a list of a few questions you’d like to discuss and prepare\nresponses individually. Once your group meets, form an inner circle and an outer circle.\nThe inner circle will do the discussing, while the outer circle will watch, listen, and take\nnotes. Over lunch, discuss how the circle felt di\u0000erent from your regular book club\nmeeting. Did the tone of the conversation change? Rules for a Socratic circle can be\nfound here: http://www.corndancer.com/tunes/tunes_print/soccirc.pdf\n3. Go on a nature walk with your book club. Notice everything around you using your \u0000ve\nsenses—what do you hear? Smell? See? Taste? How do you feel in this moment? Are you\nhappy? Collect as much “data” on your walk as possible, feeling the ground underneath\nyou, the air around you, the sky overhead. In essence, “shine a spotlight on the here and\nnow . . . earnestly and conscientiously.” Once the walk is complete, reconvene with your\nbook club and exchange notes about the experience. What was it like to live in the\nmoment? Was it a new experience for you, or something you try often? Were you\nsuccessful at shutting out the past and/or future? Why or why not?\n\f\nAbout the Authors\nICHIRO KISHIMI was born in Kyoto, where he currently resides.
