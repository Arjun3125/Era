    "raw_text": "vi CONTENTS\nCo N C LUS ION\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\nIN DEX\n245\n247\n251\n\f\nPREFACE\nWhen a professional student of social affairs writes a political\nbook, his first duty is plainly to say so. This is a political book. I\ndo not wish to disguise this by describing it, as I might perhaps\nhave done, by the more elegant and ambitious name of an essay\nin social philosophy. But, whatever the name, the essential point\nremains that all I shall have to say is derived from certain ultim­\nate values. I hope I have adequately discharged in the book itself\na second and no less important duty: to make it clear beyond\ndoubt what these ultimate values are on which the whole\nargument depends.\nThere is, however, one thing I want to add to this. Though this\nis a political book, I am as certain as anyone can be that the\nbeliefs set out in it are not determined by my personal interests. I\ncan discover no reason why the kind of society which seems to\nme desirable should offer greater advantages to me than to the\ngreat majority of the people of this country. In fact, I am always\ntold by my socialist colleagues that as an economist I should\noccupy a much more important position in the kind of society to\n\f\nviii PREFACE\nwhich I am opposed-provided, of course, that I could bring\nmyself to accept their views. I feel equally certain that my opposi­\ntion to these views is not due to their being different from those\nwith which I have grown up, since they are the very views which\nI held as a young man and which have led me to make the study\nof economics my profession. For those who, in the current fash­\nion, seek interested motives in every profession of a political\nopinion, I may, perhaps, be allowed to add that I have every\npossible reason for not writing or publishing this book. It is\ncertain to offend many people with whom I wish to live on\nfriendly terms; it has forced me to put aside work for which I\nfeel better qualified and to which I attach greater importance in\nthe long run; and, above all, it is certain to prejudice the recep­\ntion of the results of the more strictly academic work to which\nall my inclinations lead me.\nIf in spite of this I have come to regard the writing of this\nbook as a duty which I must not evade, this was mainly due to a\npeculiar and serious feature of the discussions of problems of\nfuture economic policy at the present time, of which the public\nis scarcely suffiCiently aware. This is the fact that the majority of\neconomists have now for some years been absorbed by the war\nmachine, and silenced by their official positions, and that in\nconsequence public opinion on these problems is to an alarming\nextent guided by amateurs and cranks, by people who have an\naxe to grind or a pet panacea to sell. In these circumstances one\nwho still has the leisure for literary work is hardly entitled to\nkeep to himself apprehensions which current tendencies must\ncreate in the minds of many who cannot publicly express\nthem-though in different circumstances I should have gladly\nleft the discussion of questions of national policy to those who\nare both better authorised and better qualified for the task.\nThe central argument of this book was first sketched in an\narticle entitled \"Freedom and the Economic System,\" which\nappeared in the ContemporaryReview for April, 1938, and was later\n\f\nPREFACE ix\nreprinted in an enlarged form as one of the \"Public Policy\nPamphlets\", edited by Professor H. D. Gideonse for the\nUniversity of Chicago Press (1939). I have to thank the editors\nand publishers of both these publications for permission to\nreproduce certain passages from them.\nLondon School of Economics,\nCambridge,December, 1943\n\f\nINTRODUCTION\nFew discoveries are more irritating than those which expose\nthe pedigree of ideas.\nLord Acton.\nContemporary events differ from history in that we do not know\nthe results they will produce. Looking back, we can assess the\nsignificance of past occurrences and trace the consequences they\nhave brought in their train. But while history runs its course, it is\nnot history to us. It leads us into an unknown land and but rarely\ncan we get a glimpse of what lies ahead. It would be different if\nit were given to us to live a second time through the same events\nwith all the knowledge of what we have seen before. How differ­\nent would things appear to us, how important and often alarm­\ning would changes seem that we now scarcely notice! It is\nprobably fortunate that man can never have this experience\nand knows of no laws which history must obey.\nYet, although history never quite repeats itself, and just\nbecause no development is inevitable, we can in a measure learn\n\f\n2 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nfrom the past to avoid a repetition of the same process. One need\nnot be a prophet to be aware of impending dangers. An acci­\ndental combination of experience and interest will often reveal\nevents to one man under aspects which few yet see.\nThe following pages are the product of an experience as near\nas possible to twice living through the same period-or at least\ntwice watching a very similar evolution of ideas. While this is an\nexperience one is not likely to gain in one country, it may in\ncertain circumstances be acquired by living in turn for long\nperiods in different countries. Though the influences to which\nthe trend of thought is subject in most civilised nations are to a\nlarge extent similar, they do not necessarily operate at the same\ntime or at the same speed. Thus, by moving from one country to\nanother, one may sometimes twice watch similar phases of intel­\nlectual development. The senses have then become peculiarly\nacute. When one hears for a second time opinions expressed or\nmeasures advocated which one has first met twenty or twenty­\nfive years ago, they assume a new meaning as symptoms of a\ndefinite trend. They suggest, if not the necessity, at least the\nprobability, that developments will take a similar course.\nIt is necessary now to state the unpalatable truth that it is\nGermany whose fate we are in some danger of repeating. The\ndanger is not immediate, it is true, and conditions in this coun­\ntry are still so remote from those witnessed in recent years in\nGermany as to make it difficult to believe that we are moving in\nthe same direction. Yet, though the road be long, it is one on\nwhich it becomes more difficult to turn back as one advances. If\nin the long run we are the makers of our own fate, in the short\nrun we are the captives of the ideas we have created. Only if we\nrecognise the danger in time can we hope to avert it.\nIt is not to the Germany of Hitler, the Germany of the present\nwar, that this country bears yet any resemblance. But students of\nthe currents of ideas can hardly fail to see that there is more than\na superficial similarity between the trend of thought in Germany\n\f\nINTRODUCTION 3\nduring and after the last war and the present current of ideas in\nthis country. There exists now in this country certainly the same\ndetermination that the organisation of the nation we have\nachieved for purposes of defence shall be retained for the\npurposes of creation. There is the same contempt for nineteenth­\ncentury liberalism, the same spurious \"realism\" and even cyni­\ncism, the same fatalistic acceptance of \"inevitable trends\". And at\nleast nine out of every ten of the lessons which our most vocif­\nerous reformers are so anxious we should learn from this war are\nprecisely the lessons which the Germans did learn from the last\nwar and which have done much to produce the Nazi system. We\nshall have opportunity in the course of this book to show that\nthere are a large number of other points where, at an interval of\nfifteen to twenty-five years, we seem to follow the example of\nGermany. Although one does not like to be reminded, it is not so\nmany years since the socialist policy of that country was gener­\nally held up by progressives as an example to be imitated, just as\nin more recent years Sweden has been the model country to\nwhich progressive eyes were directed. All those whose memory\ngoes further back know how deeply, for at least a generation\nbefore the last war, German thought and German practice\ninfluenced ideals and policy in this country.\nThe author has spent about half of his adult life in his native\nAustria, in close touch with German intellectual life, and the\nother half in the United States and England. In the dozen years in\nwhich this country has now become his home he has become\nincreasingly convinced that at least some of the forces which\nhave destroyed freedom in Germany are also at work here, and\nthat the character and the source of this danger are, if possible,\neven less understood than they were in Germany. The supreme\ntragedy is still not seen that in Germany it was largely people of\ngoodwill, men who were admired and held up as models in this\ncountry, who prepared the way, if they did not actually create,\nthe forces which now stand for everything they detest. Yet our\n\f\n4 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nchance of averting a similar fate depends on our facing the dan­\nger and on our being prepared to revise even our most cherished\nhopes and ambitions if they should prove to be the source of the\ndanger. There are few signs yet that we have the intellectual\ncourage to admit to ourselves that we may have been wrong. Few\nare ready to recognise that the rise of Fascism and Nazism was\nnot a reaction against the socialist trends of the preceding\nperiod, but a necessary outcome of those tendencies. This is a\ntruth which most people were unwilling to see even when the\nsimilarities of many of the repellent features of the internal\nregimes in communist Russia and national-socialist Germany\nwere widely recognised. As a result, many who think themselves\ninfinitely superior to the aberrations of Nazism and sincerely\nhate all its manifestations, work at the same time for ideals\nwhose realisation would lead straight to the abhorred tyranny.\nAll parallels between developments in different countries are,\nof course, deceptive; but I am not basing my argument mainly\non such parallels. Nor am I arguing that these developments are\ninevitable. If they were, there would be no point in writing this.\nThey can be prevented if people realise in time where their\nefforts may lead. But till recently there was little hope that any\nattempt to make them see the danger would be successful. It\nseems, however, as if the time were now ripe for a fuller discus­\nsion of the whole issue. Not only is the problem now more\nwidely recognised, there are also special reasons which at this\njuncture make it imperative that we should face the issues\nsquarely.\nIt will, perhaps, be said that this is not the time to raise an\nissue on which opinions clash sharply. But the socialism of\nwhich we speak is not a party matter, and the questions which\nwe are discussing have little to do with the questions at dispute\nbetween political parties. It does not affect our problem that\nsome groups may want less socialism than others, that some\nwant socialism mainly in the interest of one group and others in\n\f\nINTRODUCTION 5\nthat of another. The important point is that, if we take the people\nwhose views influence developments, they are now in this coun­\ntry in some measure all socialists. If it is no longer fashionable to\nemphasise that uwe are all socialists now\", this is so merely\nbecause the fact is too obvious. Scarcely anybody doubts that we\nmust continue to move towards socialism, and most people are\nmerely trying to deflect this movement in the interest of a\nparticular class or group.\nIt is because nearly everybody wants it that we are moving in\nthis direction. There are no objective facts which make it inevit­\nable. We shall have to say something about the alleged inevit­\nability of uplanning\" later. The main question is where this\nmovement will lead us. Is it not possible that if the people whose\nconvictions now give it an irresistible momentum began to see\nwhat only a few yet apprehend, they would recoil in horror and\nabandon the quest which for half a century has engaged so many\npeople of goodwill? Where these common beliefs of our gener­\nation will lead us is a problem not for one party but for every\none of us, a problem of the most momentous significance. Is\nthere a greater tragedy imaginable than that in our endeavour\nconsciously to shape our future in accordance with high ideals,\nwe should in fact unwittingly produce the very opposite of what\nwe have been striving for?\nThere is an even more pressing reason why at this time we\nshould seriously endeavour to understand the forces which have\ncreated National Socialism: that this will enable us to understand\nour enemy and the issue at stake between us. It cannot be denied\nthat there is yet little recognition of the positive ideals for which\nwe are fighting. We know that we are fighting for freedom to\nshape our life according to our own ideas. That is a great deal,\nbut not enough. It is not enough to give us the firm beliefs\nwhich we need to resist an enemy who uses propaganda as one\nof his main weapons not only in the most blatant but also in the\nmost subtle forms. It is still more insufficient when we have to\n\f\n6 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ncounter this propaganda among the people in the countries\nunder his control and elsewhere, where the effect of this propa­\nganda will not disappear with the defeat of the Axis powers. It is\nnot enough if we are to show to others that what we are fighting\nfor is worth their support, and not enough to guide us in the\nbuilding of a new Europe safe against the dangers to which the\nold one has succumbed.\nIt is a lamentable fact that the English in their dealings with\nthe dictators before the war, not less than in their attempts at\npropaganda and in the discussion of their war aims, have shown\nan inner insecurity and uncertainty of aim which can be\nexplained only by confusion about their own ideals and the\nnature of the differences which separated them from the enemy.\nWe have been misled as much because we have refused to believe\nthat the enemy was sincere in the profession of some beliefs\nwhich we shared as because we believed in the sincerity of some\nof his other claims. Have not the parties of the Left as well as\nthose of the Right been deceived by believing that the National­\nSocialist Party was in the service of the capitalists and opposed to\nall forms of socialism? How many features of Hitler's system\nhave not been recommended to us for imitation from the most\nunexpected quarters, unaware that they are an integral part of\nthat system and incompatible with the free society we hope to\npreserve? The number of dangerous mistakes we have made\nbefore and since the outbreak of war because we do not under­\nstand the opponent with whom we are faced is appalling. It\nseems almost as if we did not want to understand the develop­\nment which has produced totalitarianism because such an\nunderstanding might destroy some of the dearest illusions to\nwhich we are determined to cling.\nWe shall never be successful in our dealings with the Germans\ntill we understand the character and the growth of the ideas\nwhich now govern them. The theory which is once again put\nforth, that the Germans as such are inherently vicious, is hardly\n\f\nINTRODUCTION 7\ntenable and not very creditable to those who hold it. It dis­\nhonours the long series of Englishmen who during the past\nhundred years have gladly taken over what was best, and not\nonly what was best, in German thought. It overlooks the fact that\nwhen eighty years ago John Stuart Mill was writing his great\nessay On Liberty he drew his inspiration, more than from any\nother men, from two Germans, Goethe and Wilhelm von Hum­\nboldt,l and forgets the fact that two of the most influential intel­\nlectual forebears of National Socialism, Thomas Carlyle and\nHouston Stewart Chamberlain, were a Scot and an Englishman.\nIn its cruder forms this view is a disgrace to those who by\nmaintaining it adopt the worst features of German racial theor­\nies. The problem is not why the Germans as such are vicious,\nwhich congenitally they are probably no more than other\npeoples, but to determine the circumstances which during the\nlast seventy years have made possible the progressive growth and\nthe ultimate victory of a particular set of ideas, and why in the\nend this victory has brought the most vicious elements among\nthem to the top. Mere hatred of everything German, instead of\nthe particular ideas which now dominate the Germans is, more­\nover, very dangerous, because it blinds those who indulge in it\nagainst a real threat. It is to be feared that this attitude is fre­\nquently merely a kind of escapism, caused by an unwillingness\nto recognise tendencies which are not confined to Germany, and\nby reluctance to reexamine, and if necessary to discard, beliefs\nwhich we have taken over from the Germans and by which we\nare still as much deluded as the Germans were. It is doubly\ndangerous because the contention that only the peculiar wicked­\nness of the Germans has produced the Nazi system is likely to\nI As some people may think this statement exaggerated, the testimony of Lord\nMorley may be worth quoting, who in his Recollectionsspeaks of the \"acknow­\nledged point\" that the main argument of the essay On Liberty \"was not original\nbut came from Germany\".\n\f\n8 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nbecome the excuse for forcing on us the very institutions which\nhave produced that wickedness.\nThe interpretation of the developments in Germany and Italy\nabout to be proffered in this book is very different from that\ngiven by most foreign observers and by the majority of exiles\nfrom those countries. But if this interpretation is correct, it will\nalso explain why it -is almost impossible for a person who, like\nmost of the exiles and the foreign correspondents of English and\nAmerican newspapers, holds the now prevalent socialist views,\nto see those events in the proper perspective.\n1\nThe superficial and\nmisleading view, which sees in National-Socialism merely a reac­\ntion fomented by those whose privileges or interests were\nthreatened by the advance of socialism, was naturally supported\nby all those who, although they were at one time active in the\nmovement of ideas that has led to National-Socialism, have\nstopped at some point of that development and, by the conflict\ninto which this brought them with the Nazis, were forced to\nleave their country. But the fact that they were numerically the\nonly significant opposition to the Nazis means no more than that\nin the wider sense practically all Germans had become socialists,\nand that liberalism in the old sense had been driven out by\nsocialism. As we hope to show, the conflict in existence between\nthe National-Socialist \"Right\" and the \"Left\" in Germany is the\n1 How thoroughly the views held in all quarters, even the most conservative, of\na whole country can be coloured by the predominant Left bias of the foreign\ncorrespondents of its Press, is well illustrated by the views almost universally\nheld in America about the relations between Great Britain and India. The\nEnglishman who wishes to see events on the European Continent in the proper\nperspective must seriously consider the possibility that his views may have\nbeen distorted in precisely the same manner, and for the same reasons. This is\nin no way meant to reflect on the sincerity of the views of American and\nEnglish foreign correspondents. But anyone who knows the kind of native\ncircles with which foreign correspondents are likely to have close contacts, will\nhave no difficulty in understanding the sources of this bias.\n\f\nI NTRO DUCTI 0 N 9\nkind of conflict that will always arise between rival socialist fac­\ntions. If this interpretation is correct it means, however, that\nmany of those socialist refugees, in clinging to their beliefs, are\nnow, though with the best will in the world, helping to lead\ntheir adopted country the way which Germany has gone.\nI know that many of my English friends have sometimes been\nshocked by the semi-Fascist views they would occasionally hear\nexpressed by German refugees, whose genuinely socialist con­\nvictions could not be doubted. But while these English observers\nput this down to their being Germans, the true explanation is\nthat they were socialists whose experience had carried them\nseveral stages beyond that yet reached by socialists in this coun­\ntry. It is true, of course, that German socialists have found much\nsupport in their country from certain features of the Prussian\ntradition; and this kinship between Prussianism and socialism, in\nwhich in Germany both sides gloried, gives additional support\nto our main contention.\n1\nBut it would be a mistake to believe\nthat the specific German rather than the socialist element pro­\nduced totalitarianism. It was the prevalence of socialist views and\nnot Prussianism that Germany had in common with Italy and\nRussia-and it was from the masses and not from the classes\nsteeped in the Prussian tradition, and favoured by it, that\nNational-Socialism arose.\n1 That there did exist a certain kinship between socialism and the organisation\nof the Prussian State. consciously organised from the top as in no other coun­\ntry. is undeniable and was freely recognised already by the early French social­\nists. Long before the ideal of running the whole state on the same principles as\na single factory was to inspire nineteenth-century socialism. the Prussian poet\nNovalis had already deplored that \"no other state has ever been administered so\nmuch like a factory as Prussia since the death of Frederick William.

The external conflict is a\nresult of a transformation of European thought in which others\nhave moved so much faster as to bring them into irreconcilable\nconflict with our ideals, but which has not left us unaffected.\nThat a change of ideas, and the force of human will, have\nmade the world what it is now, though men did not foresee the\nresults, and that no spontaneous change in the facts obliged us\nthus to adapt our thought, is perhaps particularly difficult for the\nEnglish to see, just because in this development the English have,\nfortunately for them, lagged behind most of the European\npeoples. We still think of the ideals which guide us and have\nguided us for the past generation, as ideals only to be realised in\nthe future, and are not aware how far in the last twenty-five years\nthey have already transformed, not only the world, but also this\ncountry. We still believe that until quite recently we were gov­\nerned by what are vaguely called nineteenth -century ideas or the\nprinciple of laissez-faire.Compared with some other countries,\nand from the point of view of those impatient to speed up the\nchange, there may be some justification for such belief. But\nalthough till 193 1 this country had followed only slowly on the\npath on which others had led, even by then we had moved so far\nthat only those whose memory goes back to the years before the\nlast war know what a liberal world has been like.\n1\nThe crucial point of which people here are still so little aware\nis, however, not merely the magnitude of the changes which\n1 Even in that year the Macmillan Report could speak already of \"the change of\noutlook of the government of this country in recent times, its growing pre­\noccupation, irrespective of party, with the management of the life of the\npeople\" and add that \"Parliament finds itself increasingly engaged in legisla­\ntion which has for its conscious aim the regulation of the day-to-day affairs of\nthe community and now intervenes in matters formerly thought to be entirely\noutside its scope\". This could be said before, later in the same year, the country\nfinally took the headlong plunge and, in the short space of the inglorious years\n193 1 to 193 9, transformed its economic system beyond recognition.\n\f\nTHE ABANDONED ROAD 13\nhave taken place during the last generation, but the fact that they\nmean a complete change in the direction of the evolution of our\nideas and social order. For at least twenty-five years before the\nspectre of totalitarianism became a real threat, we had progres­\nsively been moving away from the basic ideas on which Euro­\npean civilisation has been built. That this movement on which\nwe have entered with such high hopes and ambitions should\nhave brought us face to face with the totalitarian horror has\ncome as a profound shock to this generation, which still refuses\nto connect the two facts. Yet this development merely confirms\nthe warnings of the fathers of the liberal philosophy which we\nstill profess. We have progressively abandoned that freedom in\neconomic affairs without which personal and political freedom\nhas never existed in the past. Although we had been warned by\nsome of the greatest political thinkers of the nineteenth century,\nby de Tocqueville and Lord Acton, that socialism means slavery,\nwe have steadily moved in the direction of socialism. And now\nthat we have seen a new form of slavery arise before our eyes, we\nhave so completely forgotten the warning, that it scarcely occurs\nto us that the two things may be connected. 1\nHow sharp a break not only with the recent past but with the\nwhole evolution of Western civilisation the modern trend\ntowards socialism means, becomes clear if we consider it not\nmerely against the background of the nineteenth century, but in\na longer historical perspective. We are rapidly abandoning not\nthe views merely of Cobden and Bright, of Adam Smith and\nHume, or even of Locke and Milton, but one of the salient\nI Even much more recent warnings which have proved dreadfully true have\nbeen almost entirely forgotten. It is not yet thirty years since Mr. Hilaire Belloc,\nin a book which explains more of what has happened since in Germany than\nmost works written after the event, explained that \"the effect of Socialist doc­\ntrine on Capitalist society is to produce a third thing different from either of its\ntwo begetters-to wit, the Servile State\" (The Servile State, 191 3, 3rd ed. 1927,\np. xiv).\n\f\n14 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ncharacteristics of Western civilisation as it has grown from the\nfoundations laid by Christianity and the Greeks and Romans.\nNot merely nineteenth- and eighteenth-century liberalism, but\nthe basic individualism inherited by us from Erasmus and\nMontaigne, from Cicero and Tacitus, Pericles and Thucydides is\nprogressively relinquished.\nThe Nazi leader who described the National-Socialist revolu­\ntion as a counter-Renaissance spoke more truly than he probably\nknew. It was the decisive step in the destruction of that civilisa­\ntion which modern man had built up from the age of the\nRenaissance and which was above all an individualist civilisation.\nIndividualism has a bad name to-day and the term has come to\nbe connected with egotism and selfishness. But the individual­\nism of which we speak in contrast to socialism and all other\nforms of collectivism has no necessary connection with these.\nOnly gradually in the course of this book shall we be able to\nmake clear the contrast between the two opposing principles.\nBut the essential features of that individualism which, from\nelements provided by Christianity and the philosophy of clas­\nsical antiquity, was first fully developed during the Renaissance\nand has since grown and spread into what we know as Western\nEuropean civilisation-the respect for the individual man qua\nman, that is the recognition of his own views and tastes as\nsupreme in his own sphere, however narrowly that may be cir­\ncumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should\ndevelop their own individual gifts and bents. \"Freedom\" and\n\"liberty\" are now words so worn with use and abuse that one\nmust hesitate to employ them to express the ideals for which\nthey stood during that period. Tolerance is, perhaps, the only\nword which still preserves the full meaning of the principle\nwhich during the whole of this period was in the ascendant\nand which only in recent times has again been in decline, to\ndisappear completely with the rise of the totalitarian state.\nThe gradual transformation of a rigidly organised hierarchic\n\f\nTHE ABANDONED ROAD 15\nsystem into one where men could at least attempt to shape their\nown life, where man gained the opportunity of knowing and\nchoosing between different forms of life, is closely associated\nwith the growth of commerce. From the commercial cities of\nNorthern Italy the new view of life spread with commerce to the\nwest and north, through France and the south-west of Germany\nto the Low Countries and the British Isles, taking firm root\nwherever there was no despotic political power to stifle it. In the\nLow Countries and Britain it for a long time enjoyed its fullest\ndevelopment and for the first time had an opportunity to grow\nfreely and to become the foundation of the social and political\nlife of these countries. And it was from there that in the late\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries it again began to spread in\na more fully developed form to the West and East, to the New\nWorld and the centre of the European continent where devastat­\ning wars and political oppression had largely submerged the\nearlier beginnings of a similar growth.\n1\nDuring the whole of this modern period of European history\nthe general direction of social development was one of freeing\nthe individual from the ties which had bound him to the\ncustomary or prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary\nactivities. The conscious realisation that the spontaneous and\nuncontrolled efforts of individuals were capable of producing a\ncomplex order of economic activities could come only after this\ndevelopment had made some progress. The subsequent elabor­\nation of a consistent argument in favour of economic freedom\nwas the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which\nhad been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political\nfreedom.\nPerhaps the greatest result of the unchaining of individual\n1 The most fateful of these developments, pregnant with consequences not yet\nextinct, was the subjection and partial destruction of the German bourgeoisie\nby the territorial princes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\f\n16 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nenergies was the marvellous growth of science which followed\nthe march of individual liberty from Italy to England and\nbeyond. That the inventive faculty of man had been no less in\nearlier periods is shown by the many highly ingenious auto­\nmatic toys and other mechanical contrivances constructed\nwhile industrial technique still remained stationary, and by the\ndevelopment in some industries which, like mining or watch­\nmaking, were not subject to restrictive controls. But the few\nattempts towards a more extended industrial use of mechanical\ninventions, some extraordinarily advanced, were promptly sup­\npressed, and the desire for knowledge was stifled, so long as the\ndominant views were held to be binding for all: the beliefs of the\ngreat majority on what was right and proper were allowed to bar\nthe way of the individual innovator. Only since industrial free­\ndom opened the path to the free use of new knowledge, only ,\nsince everything could be tried-if somebody could be found to\nback it at his own risk-and, it should be added, as often as not\nfrom outside the authorities officially entrusted with the cultiva­\ntion of learning, has science made the great strides which in the\nlast hundred and fifty years have changed the face of the world.\nAs is so often true, the nature of our civilisation has been seen\nmore clearly by its enemies than by most of its friends: \"the\nperennial Western malady, the revolt of the individual against\nthe species\", as that nineteenth-century totalitarian, Auguste\nComte, has described it, was indeed the force which built our\ncivilisation. What the nineteenth century added to the indi­\nvidualism of the preceding period was merely to make all classes\nconscious of freedom, to develop systematically and continu­\nously what had grown in a haphazard and patchy manner and to\nspread it from England and Holland over most of the European\nContinent.\nThe result of this growth surpassed all expectations. Wherever\nthe barriers to the free exercise of human ingenuity were\nremoved man became rapidly able to satisfy ever-widening\n\f\nTH E ABAN DON ED ROAD 17\nranges of desire. And while the rising standard soon led to the\ndiscovery of very dark spots in society, spots which men were no\nlonger willing to tolerate, there was probably no class that did\nnot substantially benefit from the general advance. We cannot do\njustice to this astonishing growth if we measure it by our present\nstandards, which themselves result from this growth and now\nmake many defects obvious. To appreciate what it meant to those\nwho took part in it we must measure it by the hopes and wishes\nmen held when it began: and there can be no doubt that its\nsuccess surpassed man's wildest dreams, that by the beginning\nof the twentieth century the working man in the Western world\nhad reached a degree of material comfort, security, and personal\nindependence which a hundred years before had seemed\nscarcely possible.\nWhat in the future will probably appear the most significant\nand far-reaching effect of this success is the new sense of power\nover their own fate, the belief in the unbounded possibilities of\nimproving their own lot, which the success already achieved\ncreated among men. With the success grew ambition-and man\nhad every right to be ambitious. What had been an inspiring\npromise seemed no longer enough, the rate of progress far too\nslow; and the principles which had made this progress possible\nin the past came to be regarded more as obstacles to speedier\nprogress, impatiently to be brushed away, than as the conditions\nfor the preservation and development of what had already been\nachieved.\n* * * * *\nThere is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a\nstationary creed, there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and\nfor all. The fundamental principle that in the ordering of our\naffairs we should make as much use as possible of the spon­\ntaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to\ncoercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications.

Prob­\nably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the\nwooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of\nthumb, above all the principle of laissez-faire.Yet in a sense this\nwas necessary and unavoidable. Against the innumerable inter­\nests who could show that particular measures would confer\nimmediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they\ncaused was much more indirect and difficult to see, nothing\nshort of some hard-and-fast rule would have been effective. And\nsince a strong presumption in favour of industrial liberty had un­\ndoubtedly been established, the temptation to present it as a rule\nwhich knew no exceptions was too strong always to be resisted.\nBut with this attitude taken by many popularisers of the lib­\neral doctrine, it was almost inevitable that, once their position\nwas penetrated at some points, it should soon collapse as a\nwhole. The position was further weakened by the inevitably slow\nprogress of a policy which aimed at a gradual improvement of\nthe institutional framework of a free society. This progress\ndepended on the growth of our understanding of the social\nforces and the conditions most favourable to their working in a\ndesirable manner. Since the task was to assist, and where\nnecessary to supplement, their operation, the first requisite was\nto understand them. The attitude of the liberal towards society is\nlike that of the gardener who tends a plant and in order to create\nthe conditions most favourable to its growth must know as much\nas possible about its structure and the way it functions.\nNo sensible person should have doubted that the crude rules\nin which the principles of economic policy of the nineteenth\ncentury were expressed were only a beginning, that we had yet\nmuch to learn, and that there were still immense possibilities of\nadvancement on the lines on which we had moved. But this\nadvance could only come as we gained increasing intellectual\n\f\nTHE ABANDONED ROAD 19\nmastery of the forces of which we had to make use. There were\nmany obvious tasks, such as our handling of the monetary sys­\ntem, and the prevention or control of monopoly, and an even\ngreater number of less obvious but hardly less important tasks to\nbe undertaken in other fields, where there could be no doubt\nthat the governments possessed enormous powers for good and\nevil; and there was every reason to expect that with a better\nunderstanding of the problems we should some day be able to\nuse these powers successfully.\nBut while the progress towards what is commonly called\n\"positive\" action was necessarily slow, and while for the\nimmediate improvement liberalism had to rely largely on the\ngradual increase of wealth which freedom brought about, it had\nconstantly to fight proposals which threatened this progress. It\ncame to be regarded as a \"negative\" creed because it could offer\nto particular individuals little more than a share in the common\nprogress-a progress which came to be taken more and more\nfor granted and was no longer recognised as the result of the\npolicy of freedom. It might even be said that the very success of\nliberalism became the cause of its decline. Because of the success\nalready achieved man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate\nthe evils still with him which now appeared both unbearable\nand unnecessary.\n* * * * *\nBecause of the growing impatience with the slow advance of\nliberal policy, the just irritation with those who used liberal\nphraseology in defence of anti-social privileges, and the bound­\nless ambition seemingly justified by the material improvements\nalready achieved, it came to pass that toward the turn of the\ncentury the belief in the basic tenets of liberalism was more and\nmore relinquished. What had been achieved came to be\nregarded as a secure and imperishable possession, acquired once\nand for all. The eyes of the people became fixed on the new\n\f\n20 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ndemands, the rapid satisfaction of which seemed to be barred by\nthe adherence to the old principles. It became more and more\nwidely accepted that further advance could not be expected\nalong the old lines within the general framework which had\nmade past progress pOSSible,but only by a complete remodelling\nof society. It was no longer a question of adding to or improving\nthe existing machinery, but of completely scrapping and\nreplaCing it. And as the hope of the new generation came to be\ncentred on something completely new, interest in, and under­\nstanding of, the functioning of the existing society rapidly\ndeclined; and with the decline of the understanding of the way\nin which the free system worked our awareness of what\ndepended on its existence also decreased.\nThis is not the place to discuss how this change in outlook\nwas fostered by the uncritical transfer to the problems of society\nof habits of thought engendered by the preoccupation with\ntechnological problems, the habits of thought of the natural\nscientist and the engineer, how these at the same time tended to\ndiscredit the results of the past study of society which did not\nconform to their prejudices, and to impose ideals of organisa­\ntion on a sphere to which they are not appropriate. 1 All we are\nhere concerned to show is how completely, though gradually\nand by almost imperceptible steps, our attitude towards society\nhas changed. What at every stage of this process of change had\nappeared a difference of degree only, has in its cumulative effect\nalready brought about a fundamental difference between the\nolder liberal attitude towards society and the present approach to\nsocial problems. The change amounts to a complete reversal\nof the trend we have sketched, an entire abandonment of the\nindividualist tradition which has created Western civilisation.\n1 The author has made an attempt to trace the beginning of this development in\ntwo series of articles on \"Scientism and the Study of Society\" and \"The\nCounter-Revolution of Science\" which appeared in Economica, 1941-4.\n\f\nTHE ABANDONED ROAD 21\nAccording to the views now dominant the question is no\nlonger how we can make the best use of the spontaneous forces\nfound in a free society. We have in effect undertaken to dispense\nwith the forces which produced unforeseen results and to\nreplace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the mar­\nket by collective and \"conscious\" direction of all social forces to\ndeliberately chosen goals. The difference cannot be better illus­\ntrated than by the extreme position taken in a widely acclaimed\nbook on whose programme of so-called \"planning for freedom\"\nwe shall have to comment yet more than once.\nWe have never had to set up and direct [writes Dr. Karl\nMannheim] the entire system of nature as we are forced to do\nto-day with society.... Mankind is tending more and more to\nregulate the whole of its social life, although it has never\nattempted to create a second nature.\n1\n* * * * *\nIt is significant that this change in the trend of ideas has\ncoincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas have\ntravelled in space. For over two hundred years English ideas had\nbeen spreading eastwards. The rule of freedom which had been\nachieved in England seemed destined to spread throughout the\nworld. By about 1870 the reign of these ideas had probably\nreached its easternmost expansion. From then onwards it began\nto retreat and a different set of ideas, not really new but very old,\nbegan to advance from the East. England lost her intellectual\nleadership in the political and social sphere and became an\nimporter of ideas. For the next sixty years Germany became the\ncentre from which the ideas destined to govern the world in the\ntwentieth century spread east and west.

Hoelderlin.\nThat socialism has displaced liberalism as the doctrine held by\nthe great majority of progressives does not simply mean that\npeople had forgotten the warnings of the great liberal thinkers of\nthe past about the consequences of collectivism. It has happened\nbecause they were persuaded of the very opposite of what these\nmen had predicted. The extraordinary thing is that the same\nsocialism that was not only early recognised as the gravest threat\nto freedom, but quite openly began as a reaction against the\nliberalism of the French Revolution, gained general acceptance\nunder the flag of liberty. It is rarely remembered now that social­\nism in its beginnings was frankly authoritarian. The French\nwriters who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no\ndoubt that their ideas could be put into practice only by a strong\ndictatorial government. To them socialism meant an attempt to\n\"terminate the revolution\" by a deliberate reorganisation of\n\f\nTH E GREAT UTOPIA 25\nsociety on hierarchical lines, and the imposition of a coercive\n\"spiritual power\". Where freedom was concerned, the founders\nof socialism made no bones about their intentions. Freedom of\nthought they regarded as the root-evil of nineteenth-century\nsociety, and the first of modern planners, Saint-Simon, even pre­\ndicted that those who did not obey his proposed planning\nboards would be \"treated as cattle\".\nOnly under the influence of the strong democratic currents\npreceding the revolution of 1848 did socialism begin to ally\nitself with the forces of freedom. But it took the new \"demo­\ncratic socialism\" a long time to live down the suspicions aroused\nby its antecedents. Nobody saw more clearly than de Tocqueville\nthat democracy as an essentially individualist institution stood in\nan irreconcilable conflict with socialism:\nDemocracy extends the sphere of individual freedom [he said\nin 1848], socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible\nvalue to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a\nmere number. Democracy and socialism have nothing in\ncommon but one word: equality. But notice the difference:\nwhile democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks\nequality in restraint and servitude.'\nTo allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the strongest\nof all political motives, the craving for freedom, socialism began\nincreasingly to make use of the promise of a \"new freedom\".\nThe coming of socialism was to be the leap from the realm of\nnecessity to the realm of freedom. It was to bring \"economic\nfreedom\", without which the political freedom already gained\nwas \"not worth having\". Only socialism was capable of effecting\nI \"Discours prononce aI'assemblee constituante Ie 12 Septembre 1848 sur Ia\nquestion du droit au travail.\" CEuvres completes d'Alexis de Tocquevi11~ vol.

To the great apostles of political freedom the\nword had meant freedom from coercion, freedom from the arbi­\ntrary power of other men, release from the ties which left the\nindividual no choice but obedience to the orders of a superior to\nwhom he was attached. The new freedom promised, however,\nwas to be freedom from necessity, release from the compulsion\nof the circumstances which inevitably limit the range of choice\nof all of us, although for some very much more than for others.\nBefore man could be truly free, the \"despotism of physical\nwant\" had to be broken, the \"restraints of the economic system\"\nrelaxed.\nFreedom in this sense is, of course, merely another name for\npower! or wealth. Yet, although the promises of this new free­\ndom were often coupled with irresponsible promises of a great\nincrease in material wealth in a socialist society, it was not from\nsuch an absolute conquest of the niggardliness of nature that\neconomic freedom was expected. What the promise really\namounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range\nof choice of different people were to disappear. The demand for\nthe new freedom was thus only another name for the old\n1 The characteristic confusion of freedom with power, which we shall meet\nagain and again throughout this discussion, is too big a subject to be thor­\noughly examined here.

The most\nexplicit defender of this confusion is, significantly, the leading philosopher of\nAmerican left-wingism, John Dewey, according to whom \"liberty is the effect­\nive power to do specific things\" so that \"the demand for liberty is demand for\npower\" (\"Liberty and Social Control\", The SocialFrontier,November 193 5, p. 41)."

And what is true of the leaders is even\nmore true of the rank and file of the movement. The relative ease\nwith which a young communist could be converted into a Nazi\nor vice versa was generally known in Germany, best of all to the\npropagandists of the two parties. Many a University teacher in\nthis country during the 1930s has seen English and American\nstudents return from the Continent, uncertain whether they\nwere communists or Nazis and certain only that they hated\nWestern liberal civilisation.\nIt is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933 and in Italy\nbefore 1922 communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more\nfrequently with each other than with other parties. They com­\npeted for the support of the same type of mind and reserved for\neach other the hatred of the heretic. But their practice showed\nhow closely they are related. To both, the real enemy, the man\nwith whom they had nothing in common and whom they could\nnot hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type. While to the\nNazi the communist, and to the communist the Nazi, and to\nboth the socialist, are potential recruits who are made of the\nright timber, although they have listened to false prophets, they\nboth know that there can be no compromise between them and\nthose who really believe in individual freedom.\nLest this be doubted by people misled by official propaganda\nfrom either side, let me quote one more statement from an\nauthority that ought not to be suspect. In an article under the\nsignificant title of \"The Rediscovery of Liberalism\", Professor\nEduard Heimann, one of the leaders of German religious\nsocialism, writes:\nHitlerism proclaims itself as both true democracy and true\nsocialism, and the terrible truth is that there is a grain of truth\nfor such claims-an infinitesimal grain, to be sure, but at any\n\f\nTHE GREAT UTOPIA 31\nrate enough to serve as a basis for such fantastic distortions.\nHitlerism even goes so far as to claim the role of protector of\nChristianity, and the terrible truth is that even this gross mis­\ninterpretation is able to make some impression. But one fact\nstands out with perfect clarity in all the fog: Hitler has never\nclaimed to represent true liberalism. Liberalism then has the\ndistinction of being the doctrine most hated by Hitler.'\nIt should be added that this hatred had little occasion to show\nitself in practice merely because, by the time Hitler came to\npower, liberalism was to all intents and purposes dead in\nGermany. And it was socialism that had killed it.\n* * * * *\nWhile to many who have watched the transition from socialism\nto fascism at close quarters the connection between the two\nsystems has become increasingly obvious, in this country the\nmajority of people still believe that socialism and freedom can be\ncombined. There can be no doubt that most socialists here still\nbelieve profoundly in the liberal ideal of freedom, and that they\nwould recoil if they became convinced that the realisation of\ntheir programme would mean the destruction of freedom. So\nlittle is the problem yet seen, so easily do the most irreconcilable\nideals still live together, that we can still hear such contradictions\nin terms as \"individualist socialism\" seriously discussed. If this is\nthe state of mind which makes us drift into a new world, noth­\ning can be more urgent than that we should seriously examine\nthe real significance of the evolution that has taken place\nI Social Research (New York), vol. VIII, no. 4, November 1941.-It deserves to be\nrecalled in this connection that, whatever may have been his reasons, Hitler\nthought it expedient to declare in one of his public speeches as late as February\n1941 that \"basically National Socialism and Marxism are the same\" (Cf The\nBulletin of International News published by the Royal Institute of International\nAffairs, vol. XVIII, no. 5, p. 269.)\n\f\n32 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nelsewhere. Although our conclusions will only confirm the\napprehensions which others have already expressed, the reasons\nwhy this development cannot be regarded as accidental will not\nappear without a rather full examination of the main aspects of\nthis transformation of social life. That democratic socialism, the\ngreat utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable,\nbut that to strive for it produces something so utterly different\nthat few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept\nthe consequences, many will not believe till the connection has\nbeen laid bare in all its aspects.\n\f\n3\nIN DIVI DUALISM AN D\nCOLLECTIVISM\nThe socialists believe in two things which are absolutely\ndifferent and perhaps even contradictory: freedom and\norganisation.\nElie Halevy.\nBefore we can progress with our main problem, an obstacle has\nyet to be surmounted. A confusion largely responsible for the\nway in which we are drifting into things which nobody wants\nmust be cleared up.\nThis confusion concerns nothing less than the concept of\nsocialism itself It may mean, and is often used to describe,\nmerely the ideals of social justice, greater equality and security\nwhich are the ultimate aims of socialism. But it means also the\nparticular method by which most socialists hope to attain these\nends and which many competent people regard as the only\nmethods by which they can be fully and quickly attained. In this\nsense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of\n\f\n34 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nprivate ownership of the means of production, and the creation\nof a system of \"planned economy\" in which the entrepreneur\nworking for profit is replaced by a central planning body.\nThere are many people who call themselves socialists\nalthough they care only about the first, who fervently believe in\nthose ultimate aims of socialism but neither care nor understand\nhow they can be achieved, and who are merely certain that they\nmust be achieved, whatever the cost. But to nearly all those to\nwhom socialism is not merely a hope but an object of practical\npolitics, the characteristic methods of modern socialism are as\nessential as the ends themselves. Many people, on the other\nhand, who value the ultimate ends of socialism no less than the\nsocialists, refuse to support socialism because of the dangers to\nother values they see in the methods proposed by the socialists.\nThe dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute\nabout means and not about ends-although the question\nwhether the different ends of socialism can be simultaneously\nachieved is also involved.\nThis would be enough to create confusion. And the confusion\nhas been further increased by the common practice of denying\nthat those who repudiate the means value the ends. But this is\nnot all. The situation is still more complicated by the fact that the\nsame means, the \"economic planning\" which is the prime\ninstrument of socialist reform, can be used for many other pur­\nposes. We must centrally direct economic activity if we want to\nmake the distribution of income conform to current ideas of\nsocial justice. \"Planning\", therefore, is wanted by all those\nwho demand that \"production for use\" be substituted for pro­\nduction for profit. But such planning is no less indispensable if\nthe distribution of incomes is to be regulated in a way which\nto us appears to be the opposite of just. Whether we should\nwish that more of the good things of this world should go to\nsome racial elite, the Nordic men, or the members of a party\nor an aristocracy, the methods which we shall have to employ\n\f\nINDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM 35\nare the same as those which could ensure an equalitarian\ndistribution.\nIt may, perhaps, seem unfair to use the term socialism to\ndescribe its methods rather than its aims, to use for a particular\nmethod a term which for many people stands for an ultimate\nideal. It is probably preferable to describe the methods which\ncan be used for a great variety of ends as collectivism and to\nregard socialism as a species of that genus. Yet, although to most\nsocialists only one species of collectivism will represent true\nsocialism, it must always be remembered that socialism is a spe­\ncies of collectivism and that therefore everything which is true\nof collectivism as such must apply also to socialism. Nearly all\nthe points which are disputed between socialists and liberals\nconcern the methods common to all forms of collectivism and\nnot the particular ends for which socialists want to use them;\nand all the consequences with which we shall be concerned in\nthis book follow from the methods of collectivism irrespective\nof the ends for which they are used. It must also not be forgotten\nthat socialism is not only by far the most important species of\ncollectivism or \"planning\"; but that it is socialism which has\npersuaded liberal-minded people to submit once more to that\nregimentation of economic life which they had overthrown\nbecause, in the words of Adam Smith, it puts governments in a\nposition where \"to support themselves they are obliged to be\noppressive and tyrannical\". 1\n* * * * *\nThe difficulties caused by the ambiguities of the common\npolitical terms are not yet over if we agree to use the term\ncollectivism so as to include all types of \"planned economy\",\nwhatever the end of planning. The meaning of this term becomes\n1 Quoted in Dugald Stewart's Memoirof Adam Smith from a memorandum written\nby Smith in 1755\n\f\n36 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nsomewhat more definite if we make it clear that we mean that\nsort of planning which is necessary to realise any given distribu­\ntive ideals. But as the idea of central economic planning owes its\nappeal largely to this very vagueness of its meaning, it is essential\nthat we should agree on its precise sense before we discuss its\nconsequences.\n\"Planning\" owes its popularity largely to the fact that every­\nbody desires, of course, that we should handle our common\nproblems as rationally as possible, and that in so doing we\nshould use as much foresight as we can command. In this sense\neverybody who is not a complete fatalist is a planner, every polit­\nical act is (or ought to be) an act of planning, and there can be\ndifferences only between good and bad, between wise and fore­\nsighted and foolish and short-sighted planning. An economist,\nwhose whole task is the study of how men actually do and how\nthey might plan their affairs, is the last person who could object\nto planning in this general sense. But it is not in this sense that\nour enthusiasts for a planned society now employ this term, nor\nmerely in this sense that we must plan if we want the distribu­\ntion of income or wealth to conform to some particular stand­\nard. According to the modern planners, and for their purposes, it\nis not sufficient to deSign the most rational permanent frame­\nwork within which the various activities would be conducted by\ndifferent persons according to their individual plans. This liberal\nplan, according to them, is no plan-and it is indeed not a plan\ndesigned to satisfy particular views about who should have what.\nWhat our planners demand is a central direction of all economic\nactivity according to a single plan, laying down how the\nresources of society should be \"consciously directed\" to serve\nparticular ends in a definite way.\nThe dispute between the modern planners and their\nopponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to\nchoose intelligently between the various possible organisations\nof society; it is not a dispute on whether we ought to employ\n\f\nINDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM 37\nforesight and systematic thinking in planning our common\naffairs. It is a dispute about what is the best way of so dOing. The\nquestion is whether for this purpose it is better that the holder of\ncoercive power should confine himself in general to creating\nconditions under which the knowledge and initiative of indi­\nviduals is given the best scope so that they can plan most success­\nfully; or whether a rational utilisation of our resources requires\ncentral direction and organisation of all our activities according to\nsome consciously constructed \"blueprint\nH\n• The socialists of all\nparties have appropriated the term planning for planning of the\nlatter type and it is now generally accepted in this sense. But\nthough this is meant to suggest that this is the only rational way\nof handling our affairs, it does not of course prove this. It remains\nthe point on which the planners and the liberals disagree.\n* * * * *\nIt is important not to confuse opposition against this kind of\nplanning with a dogmatic laissez-faireattitude. The liberal argu­\nment is in favour of making the best possible use of the forces of\ncompetition as a means of co-ordinating human efforts, not an\nargument for leaving things just as they are. It is based on the\nconviction that where effective competition can be created, it is a\nbetter way of guiding individual efforts than any other. It does\nnot deny, but even emphasises, that, in order that competition\nshould work beneficially, a carefully thought-out legal frame­\nwork is required, and that neither the existing nor the past legal\nrules are free from grave defects. Nor does it deny that where it is\nimpossible to create the conditions necessary to make competi­\ntion effective, we must resort to other methods of guiding\neconomic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however,\nto competition being supplanted by inferior methods of co­\nordinating individual efforts. And it regards competition as\nsuperior not only because it is in most circumstances the most\nefficient method known, but even more because it is the only\n\f\n38 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmethod by which our activities can be adjusted to each other\nwithout coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. Indeed,\none of the main arguments in favour of competition is that it\ndispenses with the need for \"conscious social control\" and that\nit gives the individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects\nof a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the\ndisadvantages and risks connected with it.\nThe successful use of competition as the principle of social\norganisation precludes certain types of coercive interference\nwith economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes\nmay very considerably assist its work and even requires certain\nkinds of government action. But there is good reason why the\nnegative requirements, the points where coercion must not be\nused, have been particularly stressed. It is necessary in the first\ninstance that the parties in the market should be free to sell and\nbuy at any price at which they can find a partner to the transac­\ntion, and that anybody should be free to produce, sell, and buy\nanything that may be produced or sold at all. And it is essential\nthat the entry into the different trades should be open to all on\nequal terms, and that the law should not tolerate any attempts by\nindividuals or groups to restrict this entry by open or concealed\nforce. Any attempt to control prices or quantities of particular\ncommodities deprives competition of its power of bringing\nabout an effective co-ordination of individual efforts, because\nprice changes then cease to register all the relevant changes in\ncircumstances and no longer provide a reliable guide for the\nindividual's actions.\nThis is not necessarily true, however, of measures merely\nrestricting the allowed methods of production, so long as these\nrestrictions affect all potential producers equally and are not used\nas an indirect way of controlling prices and quantities. Though all\nsuch controls of the methods or production impose extra costs,\nLe. make it necessary to use more resources to produce a given\noutput, they may be well worth while. To prohibit the use of\n\f\nINDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM 39\ncertain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in\ntheir use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary\narrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of com­\npetition. The only question here is whether in the particular\ninstance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs\nwhich they impose. Nor is the preservation of competition\nincompatible with an extensive system of social services-so\nlong as the organisation of these services is not designed in such\na way as to make competition ineffective over wide fields.\nIt is regrettable, though not difficult to explain, that much less\nattention than to these negative points has in the past been given\nto the positive requirements of a successful working of the\ncompetitive system. The functioning of competition not only\nrequires adequate organisation of certain institutions like\nmoney, markets, and channels of information-some of which\ncan never be adequately provided by private enterprise-but it\ndepends above all on the existence of an appropriate legal sys­\ntem, a legal system designed both to preserve competition and\nto make it operate as beneficially as possible. It is by no means\nsufficient that the law should recognise the principle of private\nproperty and freedom of contract; much depends on the precise\ndefinition of the right of property as applied to different things.\nThe systematic study of the forms of legal institutions which will\nmake the competitive system work efficiently has been sadly\nneglected; and strong arguments can be advanced that serious\nshortcomings here, particularly with regard to the law of cor­\nporations and of patents, have not only made competition work\nmuch more badly than it might have done, but have even led to\nthe destruction of competition in many spheres.\nThere are, finally, undoubted fields where no legal arrange­\nments can create the main condition on which the usefulness\nof the system of competition and private property depends:\nnamely, that the owner benefits from all the useful services\nrendered by his property and suffers for all the damages caused\n\f\n40 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nto others by its use. Where, for example, it is impracticable to\nmake the enjoyment of certain services dependent on the pay­\nment of a price, competition will not produce the services; and\nthe price system becomes similarly ineffective when the damage\ncaused to others by certain uses of property cannot be effectively\ncharged to the owner of that property. In all these instances there\nis a divergence between the items which enter into private calcu­\nlation and those which affect social welfare; and whenever this\ndivergence becomes important some method other than com­\npetition may have to be found to supply the services in question.\nThus neither the provision of signposts on the roads, nor, in\nmost circumstances, that of the roads themselves, can be paid for\nby every individual user. Nor can certain harmful effects of\ndeforestation, or of some methods of farming, or of the smoke\nand noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property\nin question or to those who are willing to submit to the damage\nfor an agreed compensation. In such instances we must find\nsome substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism. But\nthe fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regula­\ntion by authority where the conditions for the proper working\nof competition cannot be created, does not prove that we should\nsuppress competition where it can be made to function.\nTo create conditions in which competition will be as effective\nas possible, to supplement it where it cannot be made effective,\nto provide the services which, in the words of Adam Smith,\n\"though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a\ngreat society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could\nnever repay the expense to any individual or small number\nof individuals\", these tasks provide indeed a wide and\nunquestioned field for state activity. In no system that could be\nrationally defended would the state just do nothing. An effective\ncompetitive system needs an intelligently designed and\ncontinuously adjusted legal framework as much as any other.\nEven the most essential prerequisite of its proper functioning,\n\f\nINDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM 41\nthe prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of\nignorance) provides a great and by no means yet fully accom­\nplished object of legislative activity.\n* * * * *\nThe task of creating a suitable framework for the beneficial\nworking of competition had, however, not yet been carried very\nfar when states everywhere turned from it to that of supplant­\ning competition by a different and irreconcilable prinCiple. The\nquestion was no longer one of making competition work and\nof supplementing it, but of displacing it altogether. It is import­\nant to be quite clear about this: the modern movement for\nplanning is a movement against competition as such, a new flag\nunder which all the old enemies of competition have rallied.\nAnd although all sorts of interests are now trying to re-establish\nunder this flag privileges which the liberal era swept away, it is\nsocialist propaganda for planning which has restored to\nrespectability among liberal-minded people opposition to com­\npetition, and which has effectively lulled the healthy suspicion\nwhich any attempt to smother competition used to arouse. 1\n1 Of late, it is true, some academic socialists, under the spur of criticism, and\nanimated by the same fear of the extinction of freedom in a centrally planned\nsociety, have devised a new kind of \"competitive socialism\" which they hope\nwill avoid the difficulties and dangers of central planning and combine the\nabolition of private property with the full retention of individual freedom.\nAlthough some discussion of this new kind of socialism has taken place in\nlearned journals, it is hardly likely to recommend itself to practical politicians.\nIf it ever did, it would not he difficult to show (as the author has attempted\nelsewhere-see Economica, 1940) that these plans rest on a delusion and suffer\nfrom an inherent contradiction. It is impossible to assume control over all the\nproductive resources without also deciding for whom and by whom they are\nto be used. Although, under this so-called competitive socialism, the planning\nby the central authority would take somewhat more roundabout forms, its\neffects would not be fundamentally different, and the element of competition\nwould be little more than a sham.\n\f\n42 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nWhat in effect unites the socialists of the Left and the Right is\nthis common hostility to competition and their common\ndesire to replace it by a directed economy. Though the terms\ncapitalism and socialism are still generally used to describe the\npast and the future forms of society, they conceal rather than\nelucidate the nature of the transition through which we are\npassing.\nYet, though all the changes we are observing tend in the direc­\ntion of a comprehensive central direction of economic activity,\nthe universal struggle against competition promises to produce\nin the first instance something in many respects even worse, a\nstate of affairs which can satisfy neither planners nor liberals: a\nsort of syndicalist or \"corporative\" organisation of industry, in\nwhich competition is more or less suppressed but planning is\nleft in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate\nindustries. This is the inevitable first result of a situation in\nwhich the people are united in their hostility to competition but\nagree on little else. By destroying competition in industry after\nindustry, this policy puts the consumer at the mercy of the joint\nmonopolist action of capitalists and workers in the best organ­\nised industries. Yet, although this is a state of affairs which in\nwide fields has already existed for some time, and although\nmuch of the muddled (and most of the interested) agitation for\nplanning aims at it, it is not a state which is likely to persist or\ncan be rationally justified. Such independent planning by indus­\ntrial monopolies would, in fact, produce effects opposite to\nthose at which the argument for planning aims. Once this stage\nis reached the only alternative to a return to competition is the\ncontrol of the monopolies by the state, a control which, if it is to\nbe made effective, must become progressively more complete\nand more detailed. It is this stage we are rapidly approaching.\nWhen, shortly before the war, one of the weeklies pointed out\nthat \"there were many signs that British leaders are growing\naccustomed to thinking in terms of national development by\n\f\nINDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM 43\ncontrolled monopolies\", 1 this was probably a true estimate of\nthe position as it then existed. Since then this process has been\ngreatly accelerated by the war, and its grave defects and dangers\nwill become increasingly obvious as time goes on.\nThe idea of complete centralisation of the direction of eco­\nnomic activity still appalls most people, not only because of the\nstupendous difficulty of the task, but even more because of the\nhorror inspired by the idea of everything being directed from a\nsingle centre. If we are nevertheless rapidly moving towards such\na state this is largely because most people still believe that it must\nbe possible to find some Middle Way between \"atomistic\" com­\npetition and central direction. Nothing indeed seems at first\nmore plausible, or is more likely to appeal to reasonable people,\nthan the idea that our goal must be neither the extreme\ndecentralisation of free competition, nor the complete central­\nisation of a single plan, but some judicious mixture of the two\nmethods. Yet mere common sense proves a treacherous guide in\nthis field. Although competition can bear some admixture of\nregulation, it cannot be combined with planning to any extent\nwe like without ceasing to operate as an effective guide to pro­\nduction. Nor is \"planning\" a medicine which, taken in small\ndoses, can produce the effects for which one might hope from\nits thoroughgoing application. Both competition and central dir­\nection become poor and inefficient tools if they are incomplete;\nthey are alternative principles used to solve the same problem,\nand a mixture of the two means that neither will really work and\nthat the result will be worse than if either system had been\nconsistently relied upon. Or, to express it differently, plan­\nning and competition can be combined only by planning for\ncompetition, but not by planning against competition.\nIt is of the utmost importance to the argument of this book\nfor the reader to keep in mind that the planning against which all\n1 The Spectator,March 3rd, 1939, p. 337."

Musso/ini.\nIt is a revealing fact that few planners are content to say that\ncentral planning is desirable. Most of them affirm that we can no\nlonger choose but are compelled by circumstances beyond our\ncontrol to substitute planning for competition. The myth is\ndeliberately cultivated that we are embarking on the new course\nnot out of free will but because competition is spontaneously\neliminated by technological changes which we neither can\nreverse nor should wish to prevent. This argument is rarely\ndeveloped at any length-it is one of the assertions taken over by\none writer from another till, by mere iteration, it has come to be\naccepted as an established fact. It is, nevertheless, devoid of\nfoundation. The tendency towards monopoly and planning is\n\f\n46 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nnot the result of any \"objective facts\" beyond our control, but\nthe product of opinions fostered and propagated for half a\ncentury till they have come to dominate all our policy.\nOf the various arguments employed to demonstrate the\ninevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that\ntechnological changes have made competition impossible in a\nconstantly increasing number of fields, and that the only choice\nleft to us is between control of production by private mono­\npolies and direction by the government. This belief derives\nmainly from the Marxist doctrine of the \"concentration of\nindustry\" , although, like so many Marxist ideas, it is now found\nin many circles who have received it at third or fourth hand and\ndo not know whence it derives.\nThe historical fact of the progressive growth of monopoly\nduring the last fifty years and the increasing restriction of the\nfield in which competition rules is, of course, not disputed­\nalthough the extent of the phenomenon is often greatly exagger­\nated. 1 The important question is whether this development is a\nnecessary consequence of the advance of technology, or\nwhether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most\ncountries. We shall presently see that the actual history of this\ndevelopment strongly suggests the latter. But we must first con­\nsider in how far modern technological developments are of such\na kind as to make the growth of monopolies in wide fields\ninevitable.\nThe alleged technological cause of the growth of monopoly is\nthe superiority of the large firm over the small, due to the greater\neffiCiency of modern methods of mass production. Modern\nmethods, it is asserted, have created conditions in the majority of\nindustries where the production of the large firm can be\n1 For a fuller discussion of these problems see Professor L. Robbins's essay\non \"The Inevitability of Monopoly\" in The Economic Basis of Class Conflict, 1939,\npp.45-80.\n\f\nTH E \"I N EVITABllITY\" OF PLAN N I NG 47\nincreased at decreasing costs per unit, with the result that the\nlarge firms are everywhere underbidding and driving out the\nsmall ones; this process must go on till in each industry only one\nor at most a few giant firms are left. This argument singles out\none effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it\ndisregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it\nreceives little support from a serious study of the facts. We can­\nnot here investigate this question in detail and must be content\nto accept the best evidence available. The most comprehensive\nstudy of the facts undertaken in recent times is that of the Ameri­\ncan \"Temporary National Economic Committee\" on the Concen­\ntrationof EconomicPower. The final report of this Committee (which\ncertainly cannot be accused of an undue liberal bias) arrives at\nthe conclusion that the view according to which the greater\nefficiency of large-scale production is the cause of the disappear­\nance of competition \"finds scant support in any evidence that is\nnow at hand\". 1 And the detailed monograph on the question\nwhich was prepared for the Committee sums up the answer in\nthis statement:\nThe superior efficiencyof large establishments has not been\ndemonstrated; the advantages that are supposed to destroy\ncompetition have failed to manifest themselves in many fields.\nNor do the economies of size, where they exist, invariably\nnecessitate monopoly.... The size or the sizes of the optimum\nefficiencymay be reached long before the major part of a sup­\nply is subjected to such control. The conclusions that the\nadvantage of large-scale production must lead inevitablyto the\nabolition of competition cannot be accepted. It should be\nnoted, moreover, that monopoly is frequently the product of\nfactors other than the lower costs of greater size. It is attained\nI Final Report and Recommendationsof the Temporary National Economic Committee, 77th\nCongress, 1st Session, Senate Document No. 35, 1941, p. 89.\n\f\n48 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthrough collusive agreement and promoted by public policies.\nWhen these agreements are invalidated and when these\npolicies are reversed, competitive conditions can be restored.'\nAn investigation of conditions in this country would lead to\nvery similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring\nmonopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance\nof the power of the state to make their control effective can have\nlittle doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this\ndevelopment.\n* * * * *\nThis conclusion is strongly supported by the historical order in\nwhich the decline of competition and the growth of monopoly\nmanifested themselves in different countries. If they were the\nresult of technological developments or a necessary product of\nthe evolution of \"capitalism\", we should expect them to appear\nfirst in the countries with the most advanced economic system.\nIn fact they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth\ncentury in what were then comparatively young industrial\ncountries, the United States and Germany. In the latter country\nespecially, which came to be regarded as the model country\ntypifying the necessary evolution of capitalism, the growth of\ncartels and syndicates has since 1878 been systematically fos­\ntered by deliberate policy. Not only the instrument of protec­\ntion, but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion, were\nused by the governments to further the creation of monopolies\nfor the regulation of prices and sales. It was here that, with the\nhelp of the state, the first great experiment in \"scientific plan­\nning\" and \"conscious organisation of industry\" led to the cre­\nation of giant monopolies, which were represented as inevitable\n1 c. Wilcox, Competition and Monopoly in American Industry, Temporary National\nEconomic Committee, Monograph No. 21, 1940, p. 314.\n\f\nTHE \"INEVITABILITY\" OF PLANNING 49\ngrowths fifty years before the same was done in Great Britain. It\nis largely due to the influence of German socialist theoreticians,\nparticularly Sombart, generalising from the experience of their\ncountry, that the inevitable development of the competitive sys­\ntem into \"monopoly capitalism\" became widely accepted. That\nin the United States a highly protectionist policy made a some­\nwhat similar development possible, seemed to confirm this gen­\neralisation. The development of Germany, however, more than\nthat of the United States, came to be regarded as representative of\na universal tendency; and it became a commonplace to speak­\nto quote a widely read political essay of recent date-of\n\"Germany where all the social and political forces of modern\ncivilisation have reached their most advanced form\". 1\nHow little there was of inevitability in all this, and how much\nis the result of deliberate policy, becomes clear when we con­\nsider the position in this country till 193 1 and the development\nsince that year in which Great Britain also embarked upon a\npolicy of general protection. It is only a dozen years since, except\nfor a few industries which had obtained protection earlier,\nBritish industry was on the whole as competitive as, perhaps, at\nany time in its history. And, although during the 1920s it suf­\nfered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard\nto wages and to money, at least the years till 1929 compare with\nregard to employment and general activity not unfavourably\nwith the 1930s. It is only since the transition to protection and\nthe general change in British economic policy accompanying it,\nthat the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate\nand has transformed British industry to an extent the public has\nscarcely yet realised. To argue that this development has anything\nto do with the technological progress during this period, that\ntechnological necessities which in Germany operated in the\n1880s and 1890s, made themselves felt here in the 1930s, is not\n1 R. Niebuhr, Moral Man and Immoral Society, 1932.\n\f\n50 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmuch less absurd than the claim t implied in the statement of\nMussolini (quoted at the head of this chapter) that Italy had to\nabolish individual freedom before other European people\nbecause its civilisation had marched so far in advance of the rest!\nIn so far as this country is concerned t the thesis that the\nchange in opinion and policy merely follows an inexorable\nchange in the facts can be given a certain appearance of truth t\njust because England has followed at a distance the intellectual\ndevelopments elsewhere. It could thus be argued that monopol­\nistic organisation of industry grew up in spite of the fact that\npublic opinion still favoured competition t but that outside events\nfrustrated their wishes. The true relation between theory and\npractice becomes, however t clear as soon as we look to the proto­\ntype of this development t Germany. That there the suppression of\ncompetition was a matter of deliberate policyt that it was under­\ntaken in the service of the ideal which we now call planning t\nthere can be no doubt. In the progressive advance towards a\ncompletely planned society the Germans t and all the people who\nare imitating their example t are merely following the course\nwhich nineteenth-century thinkers t particularly Germans t have\nmapped out for them. The intellectual history of the last sixty or\neighty years is indeed a perfect illustration of the truth that in\nsocial evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking makes it so.\n* * * * *\nThe assertion that modern technological progress makes plan­\nning inevitable can also be interpreted in a different manner. It\nmay mean that the complexity of our modern industrial civilisa­\ntion creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal\neffectively except by central planning. In a sense this is true-yet\nnot in the wide sense in which it is claimed. It iSt for example t a\ncommonplace that many of the problems created by a modern\ntOWllt like many other problems caused by close contiguity in\nspacet are not adequately solved by competition. But it is not\n\f\nTHE \"INEVITABILITY\" OF PLANNING 51\nthese problems, like those of the \"public utilities\", etc., which\nare uppermost in the minds of those who invoke the complexity\nof modern civilisation as an argument for central planning. What\nthey generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtain­\ning a coherent picture of the complete economic process makes\nit indispensable that things should be co-ordinated by some\ncentral agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.\nThis argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the\nworking of competition. Far from being appropriate only to\ncomparatively simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the\ndivision of labour under modern conditions which makes com­\npetition the only method by which such co-ordination can be\nadequately brought about. There would be no difficulty about\nefficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a\nsingle person or board could effectively survey all the relevant\nfacts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account\nbecome so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic\nview of them, that decentralisation becomes imperative. But\nonce decentralisation is necessary, the problem of co-ordination\narises, a co-ordination which leaves the separate agencies free to\nadjust their activities to the facts which only they can know, and\nyet brings about a mutual adjustment of their respective plans.\nAs decentralisation has become necessary because nobody can\nconsciously balance all the considerations bearing on the\ndecisions of so many individuals, the co-ordination can clearly\nnot be effected by \"conscious control\", but only by arrange­\nments which convey to each agent the information he must\npossess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those of\nothers. And because all the details of the changes constantly\naffecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different\ncommodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be\ncollected and disseminated, by anyone centre, what is required\nis some apparatus of registration which automatically records all\nthe relevant effects of individual actions, and whose indications"

It contends, not that modern technique destroys competi­\ntion, but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use\nof many of the new technological possibilities unless protection\nagainst competition is granted, Le., a monopoly is conferred.\nThis type of argument is not necessarily fraudulent, as the crit­\nical reader will perhaps suspect: the obvious answer, that if a new\ntechnique for satisfying our wants is really better, it ought to be\nable to stand up against all competition, does not dispose of all\ninstances to which this argument refers. No doubt in many cases\nit is used merely as a form of special pleading by interested par­\nties. Even more often it is probably based on a confusion between\ntechnical excellence from a narrow engineering point of view\nand desirability from the point of view of society as a whole.\nThere remains, however, a group of instances where the\nargument has some force. It is, for example, at least conceivable\nthat the British automobile industry might be able to supply a\ncar cheaper and better than cars used to be in the United States if\neveryone in this country were made to use the same kind of car;\nor that the use of electricity for all purposes could be made\ncheaper than coal or gas if everybody could be made to use only\nelectricity. In instances like these it is at least possible that we\nmight all be better off, and should prefer the new situation if we\nhad the choice-but that no individual ever gets the choice,\nbecause the alternative is that either we should all use the same\ncheap car (or all should use only electricity), or that we should\nhave the choice between these things with each of them at a\nmuch higher price. I do not know whether this is true in either\nof the instances given. But it must be admitted that it is possible\nthat by compulsory standardisation or the prohibition of variety\nbeyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some\nfields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of\n\f\n54 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthe choice of the consumer. It is even conceivable that a new\ninvention may be made some day whose adoption would seem\nunquestionably beneficial, but which could be used only if many\nor all people were made to avail themselves of it at the same time.\nWhether such instances are of any great or lasting importance,\nthey are certainly not instances where it could be legitimately\nclaimed that technical progress makes central direction inevit­\nable. They would merely make it necessary to choose between\ngaining a particular advantage by compulsion and not obtaining\nit-or, in most instances, obtaining it a little later, when further\ntechnical advance has overcome the particular difficulties. It is\ntrue that in such situations we may have to sacrifice a possible\nimmediate gain as the price of our freedom-but we avoid, on\nthe other hand, the necessity of making future developments\ndependent upon the knowledge which particular people now\npossess. By sacrificing such possible present advantages we pre­\nserve an important stimulus to further progress. Though in the\nshort run the price we have to pay for variety and freedom of\nchoice may sometin1es be high, in the long run even material\nprogress will depend on this very variety, because we can never\npredict from which of the many forms in which a good or\nservice can be provided something better may develop. It cannot,\nof course, be asserted that the preservation of freedom at the\nexpense of some addition to our present material comfort will\nbe thus rewarded in all instances. But the argument for freedom\nis precisely that we ought to leave room for the unforeseeable\nfree growth. It applies, therefore, no less when, on the basis of\nour present knowledge, compulsion would seem to bring only\nadvantages, and although in a particular instance it may actually\ndo no harm.\nIn much of the current discussion on the effects of techno­\nlogical progress this progress is presented to us as if it were\nsomething outside us which could compel us to use the new\nknowledge in a particular way. While it is true, of course, that\n\f\nTH E \"I N EVITABI L1TY\" OF PLAN N I NG 55\ninventions have given us tremendous power, it is absurd to\nsuggest that we must use this power to destroy our most\nprecious inheritance: liberty. It does mean, however, that if we\nwant to preserve it, we must guard it more jealously than ever\nand that we must be prepared to make sacrifices for it. While\nthere is nothing in modern technological developments which\nforces us towards comprehensive economic planning, there is a\ngreat deal in them which makes infinitely more dangerous the\npower a planning-authority would possess.\n* * * * *\nWhile there can thus be little doubt that the movement towards\nplanning is the result of deliberate action and that there are no\nexternal necessities which force us to it, it is worth enquiring\nwhy so large a proportion of the technical experts should be\nfound in the front rank of the planners. The explanation of this\nphenomenon is closely connected with an important fact which\nthe critics of the planners should always keep in mind; that there\nis little question that almost everyone of the technical ideals of\nour experts could be realised within a comparatively short time\nif to achieve them were made the sole aim of humanity. There is\nan infinite number of good things, which we all agree are highly\ndesirable as well as possible, but of which we cannot hope to\nachieve more than a few within our lifetime, or which we can\nhope to achieve only very imperfectly. It is the frustration of his\nambitions in his own field which makes the specialist revolt\nagainst the existing order. We all find it difficult to bear to see\nthings left undone which everybody must admit are both desir­\nable and possible. That these things cannot all be done at the\nsame time, that anyone of them can be achieved only at the\nsacrifice of others, can be seen only by taking into account fac­\ntors which fall outside any specialism, which can be appreciated\nonly by a painful intellectual effort-the more painful as it\nforces us to see against a wider background the objects to which\n\f\n56 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmost of our labours are directed, and to balance them against\nothers which lie outside our immediate interest and for which,\nfor that reason, we care less.\nEveryone of the many things which, considered in isolation,\nit would be possible to achieve in a planned society, creates\nenthusiasts for planning who feel confident that they will be able\nto instil into the directors of such a society their sense of the\nvalue of the particular objective; and the hopes of some of them\nwould undoubtedly be fulfilled, since a planned society would\ncertainly further some objectives more than is the case at pres­\nent. It would be foolish to deny that the instances of planned or\nsemi-planned societies which we know do furnish illustrations\nin point, good things which the people of these countries owe\nentirely to planning. The magnificent motor roads in Germany\nand Italy are an instance often quoted-even though they do not\nrepresent a kind of planning not equally possible in a liberal\nsociety. But it is equally foolish to quote such instances of tech­\nnical excellence in particular fields as evidence of the general\nsuperiority of planning. It would be more correct to say that\nsuch extreme technical excellence out of line with general con­\nditions is evidence of a misdirection of resources. Anyone who\nhas driven along the famous German motor roads and found the\namount of traffic on them less than on many a secondary road in\nEngland, can have little doubt that, so far as peace purposes are\nconcerned, there was little justification for them. Whether it was\nnot a case where the planners decided in favour of \"guns\"\ninstead of \"butter\" is another matter. I But by our standards there\nis little ground for enthusiasm.\nThe illusion of the specialist that in a planned society he\nwould secure more attention to the objectives for which he\ncares most is a more general phenomenon than the term of\nI But as I am correcting this the news comes that maintenance work on the\nGerman motor roads has been suspended!\n\f\nTHE \"INEVITABILITY\" OF PLANNING 57\nspecialist at first suggests. In our predilections and interests we\nare all in some measure specialists. And we all think that our\npersonal order of values is not merely personal, but that in a free\ndiscussion among rational people we would convince the others\nthat ours is the right one. The lover of the country-side who\nwants above all that its traditional appearance should be pre­\nserved and that the blots already made by industry on its fair face\nshould be removed, no less than the health enthusiast who wants\nall the picturesque but insanitary old cottages cleared away, or\nthe motorist who wishes the country cut up by big motor roads,\nthe efficiency fanatic who desires the maximum of specialisation\nand mechanisation no less than the idealist who for the devel­\nopment of personality wants to preserve as many independent\ncraftsmen as possible, all know that their aim can be fully\nachieved only by planning-and they all want planning for that\nreason. But, of course, the adoption of the social planning for\nwhich they clamour can only bring out the concealed conflict\nbetween their aims.\nThe movement for planning owes its present strength largely\nto the fact that, while planning is in the main still an ambition, it\nunites almost all the single-minded idealists, all the men and\nwomen who have devoted their lives to a single task. The hopes\nthey place in planning, however, are not the result of a com­\nprehensive view of society, but rather of a very limited view, and\noften the result of a great exaggeration of the importance of the\nends they place foremost. This is not to underrate the great\npragmatic value of this type of men in a free society like ours,\nwhich makes them the subject of just admiration. But it would\nmake the very men who are most anxious to plan society the\nmost dangerous if they were allowed to do so-and the most\nintolerant of the planning of others. From the saintly and single­\nminded idealist to the fanatic is often but a step. Though it is the\nresentment of the frustrated specialist which gives the demand\nfor planning its strongest impetus, there could hardly be a\n\f\n58 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmore unbearable-and more irrational-world than one in\nwhich the most eminent specialists in each field were allowed to\nproceed unchecked with the realisation of their ideals. Nor can\n\"co-ordination\", as some planners seem to imagine, become a\nnew specialism. The economist is the last to claim that he has the\nknowledge which the co-ordinator would need. His plea is for a\nmethod which effects such co-ordination without the need for\nan omniscient dictator. But that means precisely the retention\nof some such impersonal and often unintelligible checks on\nindividual efforts as those against which all specialists chafe."

That our present society lacks such \"con­\nscious\" direction towards a single aim, that its activities are\nguided by the whims and fancies of irresponsible individuals,\nhas always been one of the main complaints of its socialist\ncritics.\nIn many ways this puts the basic issue very clearly. And it\ndirects us at once to the point where the conflict arises between\n\f\n60 THE R0 A D TO S E RFDO M\nindividual freedom and collectivism. The various kinds of\ncollectivism, communism, fascism, etc., differ between them­\nselves in the nature of the goal towards which they want to\ndirect the efforts of society. But they all differ from liberalism\nand individualism in wanting to organise the whole of society\nand all its resources for this unitary end, and in refusing to\nrecognise autonomous spheres in which the ends of the indi­\nviduals are supreme. In short, they are totalitarian in the true\nsense of this new word which we have adopted to describe the\nunexpected but nevertheless inseparable manifestations of what\nin theory we call collectivism.\nThe \"social goal\", or \"common purpose\", for which society\nis to be organised, is usually vaguely described as the \"common\ngood\", or the \"general welfare\", or the \"general interest\". It\ndoes not need much reflection to see that these terms have no\nsuffiCiently definite meaning to determine a particular course of\naction. The welfare and the happiness of millions cannot be\nmeasured on a single scale of less and more. The welfare of a\npeople, like the happiness of a man, depends on a great many\nthings that can be provided in an infinite variety of combina­\ntions. It cannot be adequately expressed as a single end, but\nonly as a hierarchy of ends, a comprehensive scale of values in\nwhich every need of every person is given its place. To direct all\nour activities according to a single plan presupposes that every\none of our needs is given its rank in an order of values which\nmust be complete enough to make it possible to decide between\nall the different courses between which the planner has to\nchoose. It presupposes, in short, the existence of a complete\nethical code in which all the different human values are allotted\ntheir due place.\nThe conception of a complete ethical code is unfamiliar and it\nrequires some effort of imagination to see what it involves. We\nare not in the habit of thinking of moral codes as more or less\ncomplete. The fact that we are constantly choosing between\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 61\ndifferent values without a social code prescribing how we ought\nto choose, does not surprise us, and does not suggest to us that\nour moral code is incomplete. In our society there is neither\noccasion nor reason why people should develop common views\nabout what should be done in such situations. But where all the\nmeans to be used are the property of society, and are to be used\nin the name of society according to a unitary plan, a \"social\"\nview about what ought to be done must guide all decisions. In\nsuch a world we should soon find that our moral code is full of\ngaps.\nWe are not concerned here with the question whether it\nwould be desirable to have such a complete ethical code. It may\nmerely be pointed out that up to the present the growth of\ncivilisation has been accompanied by a steady diminution of the\nsphere in which individual actions are bound by fixed rules. The\nrules of which our common moral code consists have progres­\nsively become fewer and more general in character. From the\nprimitive man who was bound by an elaborate ritual in almost\neveryone of his daily activities, who was limited by innumerable\ntaboos, and who could scarcely conceive of doing things in a\nway different from his fellows, morals have more and more\ntended to become merely limits circumscribing the sphere\nwithin which the individual could behave as he liked. The adop­\ntion of a common ethical code comprehensive enough to\ndetermine a unitary economic plan would mean a complete\nreversal of this tendency.\nThe essential point for us is that no such complete ethical\ncode exists. The attempt to direct all economic activity according\nto a single plan would raise innumerable questions to which the\nanswer could be provided only by a moral rule, but to which\nexisting morals have no answer and where there exists no agreed\nview on what ought to be done. People will have either no\ndefinite views or conflicting views on such questions, because in\nthe free society in which we have lived there has been no\n\f\n62 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\noccasion to think about them and still less to form common\nopinions about them.\n* * * * *\nNot only do we not possess such an all-inclusive scale of values:\nit would be impossible for any mind to comprehend the infin­\nite variety of different needs of different people which compete\nfor the available resources and to attach a definite weight to\neach. For our problem it is of minor importance whether the\nends for which any person cares comprehend only his own\nindividual needs, or whether they include the needs of his\ncloser or even those of his more distant fellows-that is,\nwhether he is egoistic or altruistic in the ordinary senses of\nthese words. The point which is so important is the basic fact\nthat it is impossible for any man to survey more than a limited\nfield, to be aware of the urgency of more than a limited number\nof needs. Whether his interests centre round his own physical\nneeds, or whether he takes a warm interest in the welfare of\nevery human being he knows, the ends about which he can be\nconcerned will always be only an infinitesimal fraction of the\nneeds of all men.\nThis is the fundamental fact on which the whole philosophy\nof individualism is based. It does not assume, as is often asserted,\nthat man is egoistic or selfish, or ought to be. It merely starts\nfrom the indisputable fact that the limits of our powers of\nimagination make it impossible to include in our scale of values\nmore than a sector of the needs of the whole society, and that,\nsince, strictly speaking, scales of value can exist only in indi­\nvidual minds, nothing but partial scales of values exist, scales\nwhich are inevitably different and often inconsistent with each\nother. From this the individualist concludes that the individuals\nshould be allowed, within defined limits, to follow their own\nvalues and preferences rather than somebody else's, that within\nthese spheres the individual's system of ends should be supreme\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 63\nand not subject to any dictation by others. It is this recognition\nof the individual as the ultimate judge of his ends, the belief that\nas far as possible his own views ought to govern his actions, that\nforms the essence of the individualist position.\nThis view does not, of course, exclude the recognition of\nsocial ends, or rather of a coincidence of individual ends which\nmakes it advisable for men to combine for their pursuit. But it\nlimits such common action to the instances where individual\nviews coincide; what are called \"social ends\" are for it merely\nidentical ends of many individuals-or ends to the achievement\nof which individuals are willing to contribute in return for the\nassistance they receive in the satisfaction of their own desires.\nCommon action is thus limited to the fields where people agree\non common ends. Very frequently these common ends will not\nbe ultimate ends to the individuals, but means which different\npersons can use for different purposes. In fact, people are most\nlikely to agree on common action where the common end is not\nan ultimate end to them, but a means capable of serving a great\nvariety of purposes.\nWhen individuals combine in a joint effort to realise ends\nthey have in common, the organisations, like the state, that they\nform for this purpose, are given their own system of ends and\ntheir own means. But any organisation thus formed remains one\n\"person\" among others, in the case of the state much more\npowerful than any of the others, it is true, yet still with its\nseparate and limited sphere in which alone its ends are supreme.\nThe limits of this sphere are determined by the extent to which\nthe individuals agree on particular ends; and the probability that\nthey will agree on a particular course of action necessarily\ndecreases as the scope of such action extends. There are certain\nfunctions of the state on the exercise of which there will be\npractical unanimity among its citizens; there will be others on\nwhich there will be agreement of a substantial majority; and\nso on, till we come to fields where, although each individual\n\f\n64 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmight wish the state to act in some way, there will be almost as\nmany views about what the government should do as there are\ndifferent people.\nWe can rely on voluntary agreement to guide the action of the\nstate only so long as it is confined to spheres where agreement\nexists. But not only when the state undertakes direct control in\nfields where there is no such agreement is it bound to suppress\nindividual freedom. We can unfortunately not indefinitely\nextend the sphere of common action and still leave the indi­\nvidual free in his own sphere. Once the communal sector, in\nwhich the state controls all the means, exceeds a certain propor­\ntion of the whole, the effects of its actions dominate the whole\nsystem. Although the state controls directly the use of only a\nlarge part of the available resources, the effects of its decisions on\nthe remaining part of the economic system become so great that\nindirectly it controls almost everything. Where, as was, for\nexample, true in Germany as early as 1928, the central and local\nauthorities directly control the use of more than half the national\nincome (according to an official German estimate then, S3 per\ncent.) they control indirectly almost the whole economic life of\nthe nation. There is, then, scarcely an individual end which is\nnot dependent for its achievement on the action of the state, and\nthe \"social scale of values\" which guides the state's action must\nembrace practically all individual ends.\n* * * * *\nIt is not difficult to see what must be the consequences when\ndemocracy embarks upon a course of planning which in its\nexecution requires more agreement than in fact exists. The\npeople may have agreed on adopting a system of directed econ­\nomy because they have been convinced that it will produce great\nprosperity. In the discussions leading to the decision, the goal of\nplanning will have been described by some such term as \"com­\nmon welfare\" which only conceals the absence of real agreement\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 65\non the ends of planning. Agreement will in fact exist only on the\nmechanism to be used. But it is a mechanism which can be used\nonly for a common end; and the question of the precise goal\ntowards which all activity is to be directed will arise as soon as\nthe executive power has to translate the demand for a single plan\ninto a particular plan. Then it will appear that the agreement on\nthe desirability of planning is not supported by agreement on\nthe ends the plan is to serve. The effect of the people agreeing\nthat there must be central planning, without agreeing on the\nends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit\nthemselves to take a journey together without agreeing where\nthey want to go: with the result that they may all have to make a\njourney which most of them do not want at all. That planning\ncreates a situation in which it is necessary for us to agree on a\nmuch larger number of topics than we have been used to, and\nthat in a planned system we cannot confine collective action to\nthe tasks on which we can agree, but are forced to produce\nagreement on everything in order that any action can be taken at\nall, is one of the features which contribute more than most to\ndetermining the character of a planned system.\nIt may have been the unanimously expressed will of the\npeople that parliament should prepare a comprehensive eco­\nnomic plan, yet neither the people nor its representatives need\ntherefore be able to agree on any particular plan. The inability of\ndemocratic assemblies to carry out what seems to be a clear\nmandate of the people will inevitably cause dissatisfaction with\ndemocratic institutions.

The conviction grows\nthat if efficient planning is to be done, the direction must be\n\"taken out of politics\" and placed in the hands of experts,\npermanent officials or independent autonomous bodies.\nThe difficulty is well known to socialists.

    "raw_text": "66 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nincapacity of the House of Commons to cope with its work\". 1\nMore recently, Professor Laski has elaborated the argument:\nIt is common ground that the present parliamentary\nmachine is quite unsuited to pass rapidly a great body of com­\nplicated legislation. The National Government, indeed, has in\nsubstance admitted this by implementing its economy and tariff\nmeasures not by detailed debate in the House of Commons\nbut by a wholesale system of delegated legislation. A Labour\nGovernment would, I presume, build upon the amplitude of\nthis precedent. It would confine the House of Commons to the\ntwo functions it can properly perform: the ventilation of griev­\nances and the discussion of general principles of its measures.\nIts Bills would take the form of general formul~ conferring\nwide powers on the appropriate government departments; and\nthose powers would be exercised by Order in Council which\ncould, if desired, be attacked in the House by means of a vote\nof no confidence. The necessity and value of delegated legisla­\ntion has recently been strongly reaffirmed by the Donoughmore\nCommittee; and its extension is inevitable if the process of\nsocialisation is not to be wrecked by the normal methods of\nobstruction which existing parliamentary procedure sanctions.\nAnd to make it quite clear that a socialist government must not\nallow itself to be too much fettered by democratic procedure,\nProfessor Laski at the end of the same article raised the question\n\"whether in a period of transition to Socialism, a Labour\nGovernment can risk the overthrow of its measures as a result of\nthe next general election\" -and left it significantly unanswered. 2\n* * * * *\nI S. and B. Webb, IndustrialDemocracy, 1897, p. 800, footnote.\n2 H. J. Laski, \"Labour and the Constitution\", The New Statesmanand Nation, No. 81\n(New Series), Sept. 10th, 1932, p. 277. In a book (Democracy in Crisis, 1933,\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 67\nIt is important clearly to see the causes of this admitted inef­\nfectiveness of parliaments when it comes to a detailed adminis­\ntration of the economic affairs of a nation. The fault is neither\nwith the individual representatives nor with parliamentary\ninstitutions as such, but with the contradictions inherent in the\ntask with which they are charged. They are not asked to act\nwhere they can agree, but to produce agreement on\neverything-the whole direction of the resources of the nation.\nFor such a task the system of majority decision is, however, not\nsuited. Majorities will be found where it is a choice between\nlimited alternatives; but it is a superstition to believe that there\nmust be a majority view on everything. There is no reason why\nthere should be a majority in favour of anyone of the different\npossible courses of positive action if their number is legion.\nEvery member of the legislative assembly might prefer some\nparticular plan for the direction of economic activity to no plan,\nyet no one plan may appear preferable to a majority to no plan\nat all.\nNor can a coherent plan be achieved by breaking it up into\nparts and voting on particular issues. A democratic assembly\nvoting and amending a comprehensive economic plan clause by\nclause, as it deliberates on an ordinary bill, makes nonsense. An\nparticularly p. 87) in which Professor Laski later elaborated these ideas, his\ndetermination that parliamentary democracy must not be allowed to form an\nobstacle to the realisation of socialism is even more plainly expressed: not only\nwould a socialist government \"take vast powers and legislate under them by\nordinance and decree\" and \"suspend the classic formul~ of normal oppo­\nsition\", but the U continuance of parliamentary government would depend on\nits [i.e. the Labour Government's] possession of guarantees from the Conserva­\ntive Party that its work of transformation would not be disrupted by repeal in\nthe event of its defeat at the polls\"!\nAs Professor Laski invokes the authority of the Donoughmore Committee it\nmay be worth recalling that Professor Laski was a member of that committee\nand presumably one of the authors of its report.\n\f\n68 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\neconomic plan, to deserve the name, must have a unitary con­\nception. Even if parliament could, proceeding step by step, agree\non some scheme, it would certainly in the end satisfy nobody. A\ncomplex whole where all the parts must be most carefully\nadjusted to each other, cannot be achieved through a comprom­\nise between conflicting views. To draw up an economic plan in\nthis fashion is even less possible than, for example, successfully\nto plan a military campaign by democratic procedure. As in\nstrategy it would become inevitable to delegate the task to the\nexperts.\nYet the difference is that, while the general who is put in\ncharge of a campaign is given a single end to which, for the\nduration of the campaign, all the means under his control have\nto be exclusively devoted, there can be no such single goal\ngiven to the economic planner, and no similar limitation of the\nmeans imposed upon him. The general has not got to balance\ndifferent independent aims against each other; there is for him\nonly one supreme goal. But the ends of an economic plan, or\nof any part of it, cannot be defined apart from the particular\nplan. It is the essence of the economic problem that the making\nof an economic plan involves the choice between conflicting or\ncompeting ends-different needs of different people. But\nwhich ends do so conflict, which will have to be sacrificed if\nwe want to achieve certain others, in short, which are the\nalternatives between which we must choose, can only be\nknown to those who know all the facts; and only they, the\nexperts, are in a position to decide which of the different ends\nare to be given preference. It is inevitable that they should\nimpose their scale of preferences on the community for which\nthey plan.\nThis is not always clearly recognised and delegation is usually\njustified by the technical character of the task. But this does not\nmean that only the technical detail is delegated, or even that the\ninability of parliaments to understand the technical detail is\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 69\nthe root of the difficulty. 1 Alterations in the structure of civil law\nare no less technical and no more difficult to appreciate in all\ntheir implications; yet nobody has yet seriously suggested that\nlegislation there should be delegated to a body of experts. The\nfact is that in these fields legislation does not go beyond general\nrules on which true majority agreement can be achieved, while\nin the direction of economic activity the interests to be recon­\nciled are so divergent that no true agreement is likely to be\nreached in a democratic assembly.\nIt should be recognised, however, that it is not the delegation\nof law-making power as such, which is so objectionable. To\noppose delegation as such is to oppose a symptom instead of the\n1 It is instructive in this connection briefly to refer to the Government docu­\nment in which in recent years these problems have been discussed. As long as\nthirteen years ago, that is before this country finally abandoned economic\nliberalism, the process of delegating legislative powers had already been carried\nto a point where it was felt necessary to appoint a committee to investigate\n\"what safeguards are desirable or necessary to secure the sovereignty of Law\".\nIn its report the \"Donoughmore Committee\" (Report of the [Lord Chancellor's]\nCommittee on Ministers' Powers, Cmd. 4060, 1932) showed that even at that date\nParliament had resorted \"to the practice of wholesale and indiscriminate dele­\ngation\" but regarded this (it was before we had really glanced into the totali­\ntarian abyss!) as an inevitably and relatively innocuous development. And it is\nprobably true that delegation as such need not be a danger to freedom. The\ninteresting point is why delegation had become necessary on such a scale. First\nplace among the causes enumerated in the report is given to the fact that\n\"Parliament nowadays passes so many laws every year\" and that \"much of the\ndetail is so technical as to be unsuitable for Parliamentary discussion\". But if\nthis were all there would be no reason why the detail should not be worked out\nbefore rather than after Parliament passes a law. What is probably in many cases a\nmuch more important reason why, \"if Parliament were not willing to delegate\nlaw-making power, Parliament would be unable to pass the kind and quantity\nof legislation which public opinion requires\" is innocently revealed in the little\nsentence that \"many of the laws affect people's lives so closely that elasticity is\nessential\"! What does this mean if not conferment of arbitrary power, power\nlimited by no fixed principles and which in the opinion of Parliament cannot\nbe limited by definite and unambiguous rules?\n\f\n70 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ncause and, as it may be a necessary result of other causes, to\nweaken the case. So long as the power that is delegated is merely\nthe power to make general rules, there may be very good\nreasons why such rules should be laid down by local rather than\nby the central authority. The objectionable feature is that delega­\ntion is so often resorted to because the matter in hand cannot be\nregulated by general rules but only by the exercise of discretion\nin the decision of particular cases. In these instances delegation\nmeans that some authority is given power to make with the\nforce of law what to all intents and purposes are arbitrary\ndecisions (usually described as \"judging the case on its\nmerits\").\nThe delegation of particular technical tasks to separate bodies,\nwhile a regular feature, is yet only the first step in the process\nwhereby a democracy which embarks on planning progressively\nrelinquishes its powers. The expedient of delegation cannot\nreally remove the causes which make all the advocates of com­\nprehensive planning so impatient with the impotence of dem­\nocracy. The delegation of particular powers to separate agencies\ncreates a new obstacle to the achievement of a single co­\nordinated plan. Even if, by this expedient, a democracy should\nsucceed in planning every sector of economic activity, it would\nstill have to face the problem of integrating these separate plans\ninto a unitary whole. Many separate plans do not make a planned\nwhole-in fact, as the planners ought to be the first to admit­\nthey may be worse than no plan. But the democratic legislature\nwill long hesitate to relinquish the decisions on really vital\nissues, and so long as it does so it makes it impossible for anyone\nelse to provide the comprehensive plan. Yet agreement that plan­\nning is necessary, together with the inability of democratic\nassemblies to produce a plan, will evoke stronger and stronger\ndemands that the government or some single individual should\nbe given powers to act on their own responsibility. The belief is\nbecoming more and more widespread that, if things are to get\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 71\ndone, the responsible authorities must be freed from the fetters\nof democratic procedure.\nThe cry for an economic dictator is a characteristic stage in the\nmovement towards planning, not unfamiliar in this country. It is\nnow several years since one of the most acute of foreign students\nof England, the late Elie Halt~vy, suggested that \"if you take a\ncomposite photograph of Lord Eustace Percy, Sir Oswald Mosley,\nand Sir Stafford Cripps, I think you would find this common\nfeature-you would find them all agreeing to say: 'We are living\nin economic chaos and we cannot get out of it except under some\nkind of dictatorial leadership' .\" 1 The number of influential pub­\nlic men whose inclusion would not materially alter the features\nof the \"composite photograph\" has since grown considerably.\nIn Germany, even before Hitler came into power, the move­\nment had already progressed much further. It is important to\nremember that for some time before 1933 Germany had reached\na stage in which it had, in effect, had to be governed dictatori­\nally. Nobody could then doubt that for the time being dem­\nocracy had broken down, and that sincere democrats like\nBriining were no more able to govern democratically than\nSchleicher or von Papen. Hitler did not have to destroy demo­\ncracy; he merely took advantage of the decay of democracy and\nat the critical moment obtained the support of many to whom,\nthough they detested Hitler, he yet seemed the only man strong\nenough to get things done.\n* * * * *\nThe argument by which the planners usually try to reconcile us\nwith this development is that so long as democracy retains\nultimate control, the essentials of democracy are not affected.\nThus Karl Mannheim writes:\n1 \"Socialism and the Problems of Democratic Parliamentarism\", International\nAffairs,vol. XIII, p. 501.\n\f\n72 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nThe only [sic] way in which a planned society differs from that\nof the nineteenth century is that more and more spheres of\nsocial life, and ultimately each and all of them, are subjected to\nstate control. But if a few controls can be held in check by\nparliamentary sovereignty, so can many.... in a democratic\nstate sovereignty can be boundlessly strengthened by plenary\npowers without renouncing democratic control.\nl\nThis belief overlooks a vital distinction. Parliament can, of\ncourse, control the execution of tasks where it can give definite\ndirections, where it has first agreed on the aim and merely dele­\ngates the working out of the detail. The situation is entirely\ndifferent when the reason for the delegation is that there is no\nreal agreement on the ends, when the body charged with the\nplanning has to choose between ends of whose conflict parlia­\nment is not even aware, and when the most that can be done is to\npresent to it a plan which has to be accepted or rejected as a\nwhole. There may and probably will be criticism; but as no\nmajority can agree on an alternative plan, and the parts objected\nto can almost always be represented as essential parts of the\nwhole, it will remain quite ineffective. Parliamentary discussion\nmay be retained as a useful safety-valve, and even more as a\nconvenient medium through which the official answers to com­\nplaints are disseminated. It may even prevent some flagrant\nabuses and successfully insist on particular shortcomings being\nremedied. But it cannot direct. It will at best be reduced to\nchoosing the persons who are to have practically absolute power.\nThe whole system will tend towards that plebiscitarian dictator­\nship in which the head of the government is from time to time\nconfirmed in his position by popular vote, but where he has all\nthe powers at his command to make certain that the vote will go\nin the direction he desires.\nI K. Mannheim, Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction,1940, p. 340.\n\f\nPLANNING AND DEMOCRACY 73\nIt is the price of democracy that the possibilities of conscious\ncontrol are restricted to the fields where true agreement exists,\nand that in some fields things must be left to chance. But in a\nsociety which for its functioning depends on central planning,\nthis control cannot be made dependent on a majority being able\nto agree; it will often be necessary that the will of a small minor­\nity be imposed upon the people, because this minority will be\nthe largest group able to agree among themselves on the ques­\ntion at issue. Democratic government has worked successfully\nwhere, and so long as, the functions of government were, by a\nwidely accepted creed, restricted to fields where agreement\namong a majority could be achieved by free discussion; and it is\nthe great merit of the liberal creed that it reduced the range of\nsubjects on which agreement was necessary to one on which it\nwas likely to exist in a society of free men. It is now often said\nthat democracy will not tolerate \"capitalism\". If \"capitalism\"\nmeans here a competitive system based on free disposal over\nprivate property, it is far more important to realise that only\nwithin this system is democracy possible. When it becomes\ndominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably\ndestroy itself.\n* * * * *\nWe have no intention, however, of making a fetish of democracy.\nIt may well be true that our generation talks and thinks too much\nof democracy and too little of the values which it serves. It\ncannot be said of democracy, as Lord Acton truly said of liberty,\nthat it \"is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the\nhighest political end. It is not for the sake of a good public\nadministration that it is required, but for the security in the\npursuit of the highest objects of civil society, and of private life.\"\nDemocracy is essentially a means, a utilitarian device for safe­\nguarding internal peace and individual freedom. As such it is by\nno means infallible or certain. Nor must we forget that there has\n\f\n74 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\noften been much more cultural and spiritual freedom under an\nautocratic rule than under some democracies-and it is at least\nconceivable that under the government of a very homogeneous\nand doctrinaire majority democratic government might be as\noppressive as the worst dictatorship. Our point, however, is not\nthat dictatorship must inevitably extirpate freedom, but rather\nthat planning leads to dictatorship because dictatorship is the\nmost effective instrument of coercion and the enforcement of\nideals, and as such essential if central planning on a large scale is\nto be possible. The clash between planning and democracy arises\nsimply from the fact that the latter is an obstacle to the suppres­\nsion of freedom which the direction of economic activity\nrequires. But in so far as democracy ceases to be a guarantee of\nindividual freedom, it may well persist in some form under a\ntotalitarian regime. A true\" dictatorship of the proletariat\", even\nif democratic in form, if it undertook centrally to direct the\neconomic system, would probably destroy personal freedom as\ncompletely as any autocracy has ever done.\nThe fashionable concentration on democracy as the main\nvalue threatened is not without danger. It is largely responsible\nfor the misleading and unfounded belief that so long as the\nultimate source of power is the will of the majority, the power\ncannot be arbitrary. The false assurance which many people\nderive from this belief is an important cause of the general\nunawareness of the dangers which we face. There is no justifica­\ntion for the belief that so long as power is conferred by demo­\ncratic procedure, it cannot be arbitrary; the contrast suggested by\nthis statement is altogether false: it is not the source but the\nlimitation of power which prevents it from being arbitrary.\nDemocratic control may prevent power from becoming arbitrary,\nbut it does not do so by its mere existence. If democracy resolves\non a task which necessarily involves the use of power which\ncannot be guided by fixed rules, it must become arbitrary power.\n\f\n6\nPLANNING\nAND THE RULE\nOF LAW\nRecent studies in the sociology of law once more confirm that\nthe fundamental principle of formal law by which every case\nmust be judged according to general rational precepts, which\nhave as few exceptions as possible and are based on logical\nsubsumptions, obtains only for the liberal competitive phase\nof capitalism.\nK. Mannheim.\nNothing distinguishes more clearly conditions in a free country\nfrom those in a country under arbitrary government than the\nobservance in the former of the great principles known as the\nRule of Law. Stripped of all technicalities this means that gov­\nernment in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced\nbeforehand-rules which make it possible to foresee with fair\ncertainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given\ncircumstances, and to plan one's individual affairs on the basis of\n\f\n76 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthis knowledge.\n1\nThough this ideal can never be perfectly\nachieved, since legislators as well as those to whom the adminis­\ntration of the law is entrusted are fallible men, the essential\npoint, that the discretion left to the executive organs wielding\ncoercive power should be reduced as much as possible, is clear\nenough. While every law restricts individual freedom to some\nextent by altering the means which people may use in the pur­\nsuit of their aims, under the Rule of Law the government is\nprevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action.\nWithin the known rules of the game the individual is free to\npursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of\ngovernment will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts.\nThe distinction we have drawn before between the creation of\na permanent framework of laws within which the productive\nactivity is guided by individual decisions, and the direction of\neconomic activity by a central authority, is thus really a particu­\n1ar case of the more general distinction between the Rule of Law\nand arbitrary government. Under the first the government con­\nfines itself to fixing rules determining the conditions under\nwhich the available resources may be used, leaving to the indi­\nviduals the decision for what ends they are to be used. Under the\nsecond the government directs the use of the means of produc­\ntion to particular ends. The first type of rules can be made in\nI According to the classical exposition by A. V. Dicey in The Law of the Constitution\n(8th ed., p. 198) the rule of law \"means, in the first place, the absolute suprem­\nacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary\npower, and excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of prerogative, or even of\nwide discretionary authority on the part of government\". Largely as a result of\nDicey's work the term has, however, in England acquired a narrower technical\nmeaning which does not concern us here. The wider and older meaning of the\nconcept of the rule or reign of law, which in England had become an estab­\nlished tradition which was more taken for granted than discussed, has been\nmost fully elaborated, just because it raised what were there new problems, in\nthe early nineteenth -century discussions in Germany about the nature of the\nRechtsstaat.\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LA W 77\nadvance, in the shape of formal rules which do not aim at the wants\nand needs of particular people. They are intended to be merely\ninstrumental in the pursuit of people's various individual ends.\nAnd they are, or ought to be, intended for such long periods that\nit is impossible to know whether they will assist particular\npeople more than others. They could almost be described as a\nkind of instrument of production, helping people to predict the\nbehaviour of those with whom they must collaborate, rather\nthan as efforts towards the satisfaction of particular needs.\nEconomic planning of the collectivist kind necessarily involves\nthe very opposite of this. The planning authority cannot confine\nitself to providing opportunities for unknown people to make\nwhatever use of them they like. It cannot tie itself down in\nadvance to general and formal rules which prevent arbitrariness.\nIt must provide for the actual needs of people as they arise and\nthen choose deliberately between them. It must constantly\ndecide questions which cannot be answered by formal principles\nonly, and in making these decisions it must set up distinctions of\nmerit between the needs of different people. When the govern­\nment has to decide how many pigs are to be reared or how many\nbuses are to be run, which coal mines are to operate, or at what\nprices boots are to be sold, these decisions cannot be deduced\nfrom formal principles, or settled for long periods in advance.\nThey depend inevitably on the circumstances of the moment,\nand in making such decisions it will always be necessary to\nbalance one against the other the interests of various persons and\ngroups. In the end somebody's views will have to decide whose\ninterests are more important; and these views must become part\nof the law of the land, a new distinction of rank which the\ncoercive apparatus of government imposes upon the people.\n* * * * *\nThe distinction we have just used between formal law or justice\nand substantive rules is very important and at the same time\n\f\n78 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nmost difficult to draw precisely in practice. Yet the general prin­\nciple involved is simple enough. The difference between the two\nkinds of rules is the same as that between laying down a Rule of\nthe Road, as in the Highway Code, and ordering people where to\ngo; or, better still, between providing signposts and command­\ning people which road to take. The formal rules tell people in\nadvance what action the state will take in certain types of situ­\nation' defined in general terms, without reference to time and\nplace or particular people. They refer to typical situations into\nwhich anyone may get and in which the existence of such rules\nwill be useful for a great variety of individual purposes. The\nknowledge that in such situations the state will act in a definite\nway, or require people to behave in a certain manner, is provided\nas a means for people to use in making their own plans. Formal\nrules are thus merely instrumental in the sense that they are\nexpected to be useful to yet unknown people, for purposes\nfor which these people will decide to use them, and in\ncircumstances which cannot be foreseen in detail. In fact, that we\ndo not know their concrete effect, that we do not know what\nparticular ends these rules will further, or which particular\npeople they will assist, that they are merely given the form most\nlikely on the whole to benefit all the people affected by them, is\nthe most important criterion of formal rules in the sense in\nwhich we here use this term. They do not involve a choice\nbetween particular ends or particular people, because we just\ncannot know beforehand by whom and in what way they will be\nused.\nIn our age, with its passion for conscious control of every­\nthing, it may appear paradoxical to claim as a virtue that under\none system we shall know less about the particular effect of the\nmeasures the state takes than would be true under most other\nsystems and that a method of social control should be deemed\nsuperior because of our ignorance of its precise results. Yet this\nconsideration is in fact the rationaleof the great liberal principle of\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LA W 79\nthe Rule of Law. And the apparent paradox dissolves rapidly\nwhen we follow the argument a little further.\n* * * * *\nThis argument is two-fold; the first is economic and can here\nonly briefly be stated. The state should confine itself to establish­\ning rules applying to general types of situations, and should\nallow the individuals freedom in everything which depends on\nthe circumstances of time and place, because only the indi­\nviduals concerned in each instance can fully know these circum­\nstances and adapt their actions to them. If the individuals are to\nbe able to use their knowledge effectively in making plans, they\nmust be able to predict actions of the state which may affect\nthese plans. But if the actions of the state are to be predictable,\nthey must be determined by rules fixed independently of the\nconcrete circumstances which can neither be foreseen nor taken\ninto account beforehand: and the particular effects of such\nactions will be unpredictable. If, on the other hand, the state\nwere to direct the individual's actions so as to achieve particular\nends, its action would have to be decided on the basis of the full\ncircumstances of the moment a\"nd would therefore be\nunpredictable. Hence the familiar fact that the more the state\n\"plans\" the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.\nThe second, moral or political, argument is even more directly\nrelevant to the point under discussion. If the state is precisely to\nforesee the incidence of its actions, it means that it can leave\nthose affected no choice. Wherever the state can exactly foresee\nthe effects on particular people of alternative courses of action, it\nis also the state which chooses between the different ends. If we\nwant to create new opportunities open to all, to offer chances of\nwhich people can make what use they like, the precise results\ncannot be foreseen. General rules, genuine laws as distinguished\nfrom specific orders, must therefore be intended to operate in\ncircumstances which cannot be foreseen in detail, and, therefore,\n\f\n80 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ntheir effect on particular ends or particular people cannot be\nknown beforehand. It is in this sense alone that it is at all possible\nfor the legislator to be impartial. To be impartial means to have\nno answer to certain questions-to the kind of questions which,\nif we have to decide them, we decide by tossing a coin. In a\nworld where everything was precisely foreseen, the state could\nhardly do anything and remain impartial. But where the precise\neffects of government policy on particular people are known,\nwhere the government aims directly at such particular effects, it\ncannot help knowing these effects, and therefore it cannot be\nimpartial. It must, of necessity, take sides, impose its valuations\nupon people and, instead of assisting them in the advancement\nof their own ends, choose the ends for them. As soon as the\nparticular effects are foreseen at the time a law is made, it ceases\nto be a mere instrument to be used by the people and becomes\ninstead an instrument used by the law-giver upon the people\nand for his ends. The state ceases to be a piece of utilitarian\nmachinery intended to help individuals in the fullest develop­\nment of their individual personality and becomes a \"moral\"\ninstitution-where \"moral\" is not used in contrast to immoral,\nbut describes an institution which imposes on its members its\nviews on all moral questions, whether these views be moral or\nhighly immoral. In this sense the Nazi or any other collectivist\nstate is \"moral\", while the liberal state is not.\nPerhaps it will be said that all this raises no serious problem\nbecause in the kind of questions which the economic planner\nwould have to decide he need not and should not be guided by\nhis individual prejudices, but could rely on the general convic­\ntion of what is fair and reasonable. This contention usually\nreceives support from those who have experience of planning in\na particular industry and who find that there is no insuperable\ndifficulty about arriving at a decision which all those immedi­\nately interested will accept as fair. The reason why this experi­\nence proves nothing is, of course, the selection of the \"interests\"\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LAW 81\nconcerned when planning is confined to a particular industry.\nThose most immediately interested in a particular issue are not\nnecessarily the best judges of the interests of society as a whole.\nTo take only the most characteristic case: when capital and\nlabour in an industry agree on some policy of restriction and\nthus exploit the consumers, there is usually no difficulty about\nthe division of the spoils in proportion to former earnings or on\nsome similar principle. The loss which is divided between thou­\nsands or millions is usually either simply disregarded or quite\ninadequately considered. If we want to test the usefulness of the\nprinciple of \"fairness\" in deciding the kind of issues which arise\nin economic planning, we must apply it to some question where\nthe gains and the losses are seen equally clearly. In such instances\nit is readily recognised that no general principle such as fairness\ncan provide an answer. When we have to choose between higher\nwages for nurses or doctors and more extensive services for the\nsick, more milk for children and better wages for agricultural\nworkers, or between employment for the unemployed or better\nwages for those already employed, nothing short of a complete\nsystem of values in which every want of every person or group\nhas a definite place is necessary to provide an answer.\nIn fact, as planning becomes more and more extensive, it\nbecomes regularly necessary to qualify legal provisions increas­\ningly by reference to what is \"fair\" or \"reasonable\"; this means\nthat it becomes necessary to leave the decision of the concrete\ncase more and more to the discretion of the judge or authority in\nquestion. One could write a history of the decline of the Rule of\nLaw, the disappearance of the Rechtsstaat,in terms of the progres­\nsive introduction of these vague formulce into legislation and\njurisdiction, and of the increasing arbitrariness and uncertainty\nof, and the consequent disrespect for, the law and the judicature,\nwhich in these circumstances could not but become an instru­\nment of policy. It is important to point out once more in this\nconnection that this process of the decline of the Rule of Law\n\f\n82 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nhad been going on steadily in Germany for some time before\nHitler came into power, and that a policy well advanced towards\ntotalitarian planning had already done a great deal of the work\nwhich Hitler completed.\nThere can be no doubt that planning necessarily involves\ndeliberate discrimination between particular needs of different\npeople, and allowing one man to do what another must be\nprevented from doing. It must lay down by a legal rule how well\noff particular people shall be and what different people are to be\nallowed to have and do. It means in effect a return to the rule of\nstatus, a reversal of the \"movement of progressive societies\"\nwhich, in the famous phrase of Sir Henry Maine, \"has hitherto\nbeen a movement from status to contract\". Indeed, the Rule of\nLaw, more than the rule of contract, should probably be regarded\nas the true opposite of the rule of status. It is the Rule of Law, in\nthe sense of the rule of formal law, the absence of legal privileges\nof particular people designated by authority, which safeguards\nthat equality before the law which is the opposite of arbitrary\ngovernment.\n* * * * *\nA necessary, and only apparently paradoxical, result of this is that\nformal equality before the law is in conflict, and in fact\nincompatible, with any activity of the government deliberately\naiming at material or substantive equality of different people,\nand that any policy aiming at a substantive ideal of distributive\njustice must lead to the destruction of the Rule of Law. To pro­\nduce the same result for different people it is necessary to treat\nthem differently. To give different people the same objective\nopportunities is not to give them the same subjective chance. It\ncannot be denied that the Rule of Law produces economic\ninequality-all that can be claimed for it is that this inequality is\nnot designed to affect particular people in a particular way. It is\nvery significant and characteristic that socialists (and Nazis) have\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LAW 83\nalways protested against \"merely\" formal justice, that they have\nalways objected to a law which had no views on how well off\nparticular people ought to be,l and that they have always\ndemanded a \"socialisation of the law\", attacked the independ­\nence of judges, and at the same time given their support to all\nsuch movements as the Freirechtsschulewhich undermined the\nRule of Law.\nIt may even be said that for the Rule of Law to be effective it is\nmore important that there should be a rule applied always with­\nout exceptions, than what this rule is. Often the content of the\nrule is indeed of minor importance, provided the same rule is\nuniversally enforced. To revert to a former example: it does not\nmatter whether we all drive on the left- or on the right-hand\nside of the road so long as we all do the same. The important\nthing is that the rule enables us to predict other people's\nbehaviour correctly, and this requires that it should apply to all\ncases-even if in a particular instance we feel it to be unjust.\nThe conflict between formal justice and formal equality\nbefore the law on the one hand, and the attempts to realise\nvarious ideals of substantive justice and equality on the other,\nalso accounts for the widespread confusion about the concept of\n\"privilege\" and its consequent abuse. To mention only the most\nimportant instance of this abuse-the application of the term\nprivilege to property as such. It would indeed be privilege if, for\nexample, as has sometimes been the case in the past, landed prop­\nerty were reserved to members of the nobility. And it is privilege\nif, as is true in our time, the right to produce or sell particular\nthings is reserved to particular people deSignated by authority.\nBut to call private property as such, which all can acquire under\nI It is therefore not altogether false when the legal theorist of National­\nSocialism, Carl Schmitt, opposes to the liberal Rechtsstaat (Le. the Rule of Law)\nthe national-socialist ideal of the gerechteStaat (the just state)-only that the sort\nof justice which is opposed to formal justice necessarily implies discrimination\nbetween persons.\n\f\n84 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthe same rules, a privilege, because only some succeed in\nacquiring it, is depriving the word privilege of its meaning.\nThe unpredictability of the particular effects, which is the\ndistinguishing characteristic of the formal laws of a liberal sys­\ntem, is also important because it helps us to clear up another\nconfusion about the nature of this system: the belief that its\ncharacteristic attitude is inaction of the state. The question\nwhether the state should or should not \"act\" or \"interfere\"\nposes an altogether false alternative, and the term laissez-faireis a\nhighly ambiguous and misleading description of the principles\non which a liberal policy is based. Of course, every state must act\nand every action of the state interferes with something or other.\nBut that is not the point. The important question is whether the\nindividual can foresee the action of the state and make use of this\nknowledge as a datum in forming his own plans, with the result\nthat the state cannot control the use made of its machinery, and\nthat the individual knows precisely how far he will be protected\nagainst interference from others, or whether the state is in a\nposition to frustrate individual efforts. The state controlling\nweights and measures (or preventing fraud and deception in any\nother way) is certainly acting, while the state permitting the use\nof violence, for example, by strike pickets, is inactive. Yet it is in\nthe first case that the state observes liberal prinCiples and in the\nsecond that it does not. Similarly with respect to most of the\ngeneral and permanent rules which the state may establish with\nregard to production, such as building regulations or factory\nlaws: these may be wise or unwise in the particular instance, but\nthey do not conflict with liberal principles so long as they are\nintended to be permanent and are not used to favour or harm\nparticular people. It is true that in these instances there will,\napart from the long-run effects which cannot be predicted,\nalso be short-run effects on particular people which may be\nclearly known. But with this kind of laws the short-run effects\nare in general not (or at least ought not to be) the gUiding\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LA W 85\nconsideration. As these immediate and predictable effects\nbecome more important compared with the long-run effects, we\napproach the border-line where the distinction, however, clear\nin principle, becomes blurred in practice.\n* * * * *\nThe Rule of Law was consciously evolved only during the liberal\nage and is one of its greatest achievements, not only as a safe­\nguard but as the legal embodiment of freedom. As Immanuel\nKant put it (and Voltaire expressed it before him in very much\nthe same terms), \"Man is free if he needs to obey no person but\nsolely the laws\". As a vague ideal it has, however, existed at least\nsince Roman times, and during the last few centuries it has never\nbeen as seriously threatened as it is to-day. The idea that there is\nno limit to the powers of the legislator is in part a result of\npopular sovereignty and democratic government. It has been\nstrengthened by the belief that so long as all actions of the state\nare duly authorised by legislation, the Rule of Law will be pre­\nserved. But this is completely to misconceive the meaning of the\nRule of Law. This rule has little to do with the question whether\nall actions of government are legal in the juridical sense. They\nmay well be and yet not conform to the Rule of Law. The fact that\nsomebody has full legal authority to act in the way he does gives\nno answer to the question whether the law gives him power to\nact arbitrarily or whether the law prescribes unequivocally how\nhe has to act. It may well be that Hitler has obtained his\nunlimited powers in a strictly constitutional manner and that\nwhatever he does is therefore legal in the juridical sense. But\nwho would suggest for that reason that the Rule of Law still\nprevails in Germany?\nTo say that in a planned society the Rule of Law cannot hold is,\ntherefore, not to say that the actions of the government will not\nbe legal or that such a society will necessarily be lawless. It\nmeans only that the use of the government's coercive powers\n\f\n86 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nwill no longer be limited and determined by pre-established\nrules. The law can, and to make a central direction of economic\nactivity possibly must, legalise what to all intents and purposes\nremains arbitrary action. If the law says that such a Board or\nAuthority may do what it pleases, anything that Board or Author­\nity does is legal-but its actions are certainly not subject to\nthe Rule of Law. By giving the government unlimited powers the\nmost arbitrary rule can be made legal: and in this way a\ndemocracy may set up the most complete despotism imaginable. 1\nIf, however, the law is to enable authorities to direct economic\nlife, it must give them powers to make and enforce decisions in\ncircumstances which cannot be foreseen and on principles\nwhich cannot be stated in generic form. The consequence is that\nas planning extends, the delegation of legislative powers to\ndivers Boards and Authorities becomes increasingly common.\nWhen before the last war, in a case to which the late Lord Hewart\nhas recently drawn attention, Mr. Justice Darling said \"that Par­\nliament had enacted only last year that the Board of Agriculture\nin acting as they did should be no more impeachable than Par­\nliament itself\", this was still a rare thing. It has since become an\nalmost daily occurrence. Constantly the broadest powers are con­\nferred on new authorities which, without being bound by fixed\n1 The conflict is thus not, as it has often been misconceived in nineteenth­\ncentury discussions, one between liberty and law. As John Locke had already\nmade clear, there can be no liberty without law. The conflict is between differ­\nent kinds of law, law so different that it should hardly be called by the same\nname: one is the law of the Rule of Law, general principles laid down before­\nhand, the \"rules of the game\" which enable individuals to foresee how the\ncoercive apparatus of the state will be used, or what he and his fellow-citizens\nwill be allowed to do, or lnade to do, in stated circumstances. The other kind of\nlaw gives in effect the authority power to do what it thinks fit to do. Thus the\nRule of Law could clearly not be preserved in a democracy that undertook to\ndecide every conflict of interests not according to rules previously laid down,\nbut \"on its merits\".\n\f\nP LA N N I N G AND THE RU LEO F LA W 87\nrules, have almost unlimited discretion in regulating this or that\nactivity of the people.\nThe Rule of Law thus implies limits to the scope of legislation:\nit restricts it to the kind of general rules known as formal law,\nand excludes legislation either directly aimed at particular\npeople, or at enabling anybody to use the coercive power of the\nstate for the purpose of such discrimination. It means, not that\neverything is regulated by law, but, on the contrary, that the\ncoercive power of the state can be used only in cases defined in\nadvance by the law and in such a way that it can be foreseen how\nit will be used. A particular enactment can thus infringe the Rule\nof Law. Anyone ready to deny this would have to contend that\nwhether the Rule of Law prevails to-day in Germany, Italy, or\nRussia, depends on whether the dictators have obtained their\nabsolute power by constitutional means. 1\n* * * * *\nI Another illustration of an infringement of the Rule of Law by legislation is the\ncase of the bill of attainder, familiar in the history of this country. The form\nwhich the Rule of Law takes in criminal law is usually expressed by the Latin\ntag nulla poena sine lege-no punishment without a law expressly prescribing it.\nThe essence of this rule is that the law must have existed as a general rule before\nthe individual case arose to which it is to be applied. Nobody would argue that,\nwhen in a famous case in Henry VIII's reign Parliament resolved with respect to\nthe Bishop of Rochester's cook \"that the said Richard Rose shall be boiled to\ndeath without having the advantage of his clergy\", this act was performed\nunder the Rule of Law. But while the Rule of Law had become an essential part\nof criminal procedure in all liberal countries, it cannot be preserved in totali­\ntarian regimes. There, as E. B. Ashton has well expressed it, the liberal maxim is\nreplaced by the principles nullum crimen sine poena-no \"crime\" must remain\nwithout punishment, whether the law expliCitly provides for it or not. \"The\nrights of the state do not end with punishing law breakers. The community is\nentitled to whatever may seem necessary to the protection of its interests-of\nwhich observance of the law, as it stands, is only one of the more elementary\nrequirements\" (E. B. Ashton, The Fascist,His State and Mind, 193 7, p. 11 9). What is\nan infringement of \"the interests of the community\" is, of course, decided by\nthe authorities.\n\f\n88 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nWhether, as in some countries, the main applications of the Rule\nof Law are laid down in a Bill of Rights or a Constitutional Code,\nor whether the principle is merely a firmly established tradition,\nmatters comparatively little. But it will readily be seen that\nwhatever form it takes, any such recognised limitations of the\npowers of legislation imply the recognition of the inalienable\nright of the individual, inviolable rights of man.\nIt is pathetic, but characteristic of the muddle into which\nmany of our intellectuals have been led by the conflicting ideals\nin which they believe, that a leading advocate of the most com­\nprehensive central planning like Mr. H. G. Wells should at the\nsame time write an ardent defence of the Rights of Man. The\nindividual rights which Mr. Wells hopes to preserve would\ninevitably obstruct the planning which he desires. To some\nextent he seems to realise the dilemma, and we find therefore the\nprovisions of his proposed \"Declaration of the Rights of Man\" so\nhedged about with qualifications that they lose all significance.\nWhile, for instance, his Declaration proclaims that every man\n\"shall have the right to buy and sell without any discriminatory\nrestrictions anything which may be lawfully bought and sold\",\nwhich is admirable, he immediately proceeds to make the whole\nprovision nugatory by adding that it applies only to buying and\nselling \"in such quantities and with such reservations as are\ncompatible with the common welfare\". But since, of course, all\nrestrictions ever imposed upon buying or selling anything are\nsupposed to be necessary in the interest of the \"common wel­\nfare\", there is really no restriction which this clause effectively\nprevents, and no right of the individual that is safeguarded by it.\nOr, to take another basic clause, the Declaration states that every\nman \"may engage in any lawful occupation\" and that \"he is\nentitled to paid employment and to a free choice whenever there\nis any variety of employment open to him\". It is not stated,\nhowever, who is to decide whether a particular employment is\n\"open\" to a particular person, and the added provision that \"he\n\f\nPLANNING AND THE RULE OF LAW 89\nmay suggest employment for himself and have his claim publicly\nconsidered, accepted or dismissed\" shows that Mr. Wells is\nthinking in terms of an authority which decides whether a man\nis \"entitled\" to a particular position-which certainly means the\nopposite of free choice of occupation. And how in a planned\nworld \"freedom of travel and migration\" is to be secured when\nnot only the means of communication and currencies are con­\ntrolled, but also the location of industries planned, or how the\nfreedom of the press is to be safeguarded when the supply of\npaper and all the channels of distribution are controlled by the\nplanning authority, are questions to which Mr. Wells provides as\nlittle answer as any other planner.\nIn this respect much more consistency is shown by the more\nnumerous reformers who, ever since the beginning of the social­\nist movement, have attacked the \"metaphysical\" idea of indi­\nvidual rights and insisted that in a rationally ordered world there\nwill be no individual rights but only individual duties. This,\nindeed, has become the much more common attitude of our so­\ncalled progressives, and few things are more certain to expose\none to the reproach of being a reactionary than if one protests\nagainst a measure on the grounds that it is a violation of the\nrights of the individual. Even a liberal paper like The Economistwas\na few years ago holding up to us the example of the French, of all\npeople, who had learnt the lesson\nthat democratic government no less than dictatorship must\nalways [sic] have plenary powers in posse, without sacrificing\ntheir democratic and representative character. There is no\nrestrictive penumbra of individual rights that can never be\ntouched by government in administrative matters whatever\nthe circumstances. There is no limit to the power of ruling\nwhich can and should be taken by a government freely chosen\nby the people and can be fully and openly criticised by an\nopposition."

This oppression by means of economic policy was greatly\nfacilitated by the fact that particular industries or activities were\nlargely in the hands of a national minority so that many a\nmeasure aimed ostensibly against an industry or class was in\nfact aimed at a national minority. But the almost boundless\npossibilities for a policy of discrimination and oppression pro­\nvided by such apparently innocuous principles as \"government\ncontrol of the development of industries\" have been amply\ndemonstrated to all those desirous of seeing how the political\nconsequences of planning appear in practice."

That the complex\nsystem of interrelated activities, if it is to be consciously directed\nat all, must be directed by a single staff of experts, and that\nultimate responsibility and power must rest in the hands of a\ncommander-in-chief, whose actions must not be fettered by\ndemocratic procedure, is too obvious a consequence of under­\nlying ideas of central planning not to command fairly general\nassent. The consolation our planners offer us is that this authori­\ntarian direction will apply \"only\" to economic matters. One of\nthe most prominent American planners, Mr. Stuart Chase, assures\nus, for instance, that in a planned society \"political democracy\n\f\n92 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\ncan remain if it confines itself to all but economic matter\". Such\nassurances are usually accompanied by the suggestion that by\ngiving up freedom in what are, or ought to be, the less import­\nant aspects of our lives, we shall obtain greater freedom in the\npursuit of higher values. On this ground people who abhor the\nidea of a political dictatorship often clamour for a dictator in\nthe economic field.\nThe arguments used appeal to our best instincts and often\nattract the finest minds. If planning really did free us from the\nless important cares and so made it easier to render our existence\none of plain living and high thinking, who would wish to\nbelittle such an ideal? If our economic activities really concerned\nonly the inferior or even more sordid sides of life, of course we\nought to endeavour by all means to find a way to relieve our­\nselves from the excessive care for material ends, and, leaving\nthem to be cared for by some piece of utilitarian machinery, set\nour minds free for the higher things of life.\nUnfortunately the assurance people derive from this belief\nthat the power which is exercised over economic life is a power\nover matters of secondary importance only, and which makes\nthem take lightly the threat to the freedom of our economic\npursuits, is altogether unwarranted. It is largely a consequence of\nthe erroneous belief that there are purely economic ends separ­\nate from the other ends of life. Yet, apart from the pathological\ncase of the miser, there is no such thing. The ultimate ends of the\nactivities of reasonable beings are never economic. Strictly speak­\ning there is no \"economic motive\" but only economic factors\nconditioning our striving for other ends. What in ordinary\nlanguage is misleadingly called the \"economic motive\"\nmeans merely the desire for general opportunity, the desire for\npower to achieve unspecified ends. 1 If we strive for money it is\nbecause it offers us the widest choice in enjoying the fruits of\nI Cf. L. Robbins, The Economic Causes of War, 1939, Appendix.\n\f\nECONOM IC CONTROL AN D TOTALITARIAN ISM 93\nour efforts. Because in modern society it is through the limita­\ntion of our money incomes that we are made to feel the restric­\ntions which our relative poverty still imposes upon us, many\nhave come to hate money as the symbol of these restrictions. But\nthis is to mistake for the cause the medium through which a\nforce makes itself felt. It would be much truer to say that money\nis one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented by\nman. It is money which in existing society opens an astounding\nrange of choice to the poor man, a range greater than that which\nnot many generations ago was open to the wealthy. We shall\nbetter understand the significance of this service of money if we\nconsider what it would really mean if, as so many socialists\ncharacteristically propose, the \"pecuniary motive\" were largely\ndisplaced by \"non-economic incentives\". If all rewards, instead\nof being offered in money, were offered in the form of public\ndistinctions or privileges, positions of power over other men, or\nbetter housing or better food, opportunities for travel or educa­\ntion, this would merely mean that the recipient would no longer\nbe allowed to choose, and that, whoever fixed the reward,\ndetermined not only its size but also the particular form in\nwhich it should be enjoyed.\n* * * * *\nOnce we realise that there is no separate economic motive and\nthat an economic gain or economic loss is merely a gain or a loss\nwhere it is still in our power to decide which of our needs or\ndesires shall be affected, it is also easier to see the important\nkernel of truth in the general belief that economic matters affect\nonly the less important ends of life, and to understand the con­\ntempt in which \"merely\" economic considerations are often\nheld. In a sense this is quite justified in a market economy-but\nonly in such a free economy. So long as we can freely dispose\nover our income and all our possessions, economic loss will\nalways deprive us only of what we regard as the least important"

Although a planned society would probably to\nsome extent employ rationing and similar devices, the power of\nthe planner over our private lives does not depend on this, and\nwould be hardly less effective if the consumer were nominally\nfree to spend his income as he pleased. The source of this power\nover all consumption which in a planned society the authority\nwould possess would be their control over production.\nOur freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the\nfact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes we can turn\nto another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his mercy. And\nan authority directing the whole economic system would be the\nmost powerful monopolist conceivable. While we need probably\nnot be afraid that such an authority would exploit this power in\nthe manner in which a private monopolist would do so, while\nits purpose would presumably not be the extortion of maximum\nfinancial gain, it would have complete power to decide what we\nare to be given and on what terms. It would not only decide\nwhat commodities and services were to be available, and in what\nquantities; it would be able to direct their distribution between\ndistricts and groups and could, if it wished, discriminate\nbetween persons to any degree it liked. If we remember why\nplanning is advocated by most people, can there be much\ncomplete indifference. Yet the experience of most continental countries has\ntaught thoughtful people to regard this step as the decisive advance on the path\nto totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty.

This price\nis not determined by the conscious will of anybody. And if one\nway of achieving our ends proves too expensive for us, we are\nfree to try other ways. The obstacles in our path are not due to\nsomebody disapproving of our ends, but to the fact that the same\nmeans are also wanted elsewhere. In a directed economy, where\nthe authority watches over the ends pursued, it is certain that it\nwould use its powers to assist some ends and to prevent the\nrealisation of others. Not our own view, but somebody else's, of\nwhat we ought to like or dislike would determine what we\nshould get.

But what matters is that we have some\nchoice, that we are not absolutely tied to a particular job which\nhas been chosen for us, or which we may have chosen in the past,\nand that if one position becomes quite intolerable, or if we set\nour heart on another, there is almost always a way for the able,\nsome sacrifice at the price of which he may achieve his goal.\nNothing makes conditions more unbearable than the knowledge\nthat no effort of ours can change them; and even if we should\nnever have the strength of mind to make the necessary sacrifice,\nthe knowledge that we could escape if we only strove hard\nenough makes many otherwise intolerable positions bearable.\nThis is not to say that in this respect all is for the best in our\npresent world, or has been so in the most liberal past, and that\nthere is not much that could be done to improve the opportun­\nities of choice open to the people. Here as elsewhere the state can\ndo a great deal to help the spreading of knowledge and informa­\ntion and to assist mobility. But the point is that the kind of state\naction which really would increase opportunity is almost pre­\ncisely the opposite of the \"planning\" which is now generally\nadvocated and practised. Most planners, it is true, promise that in\nthe new planned world free choice of occupation will be scrupu­\nlously preserved or even increased. But there they promise more\nthan they can possibly fulfil. If they want to plan they must\ncontrol the entry into the different trades and occupations, or\nthe terms of remuneration, or both. In almost all known\ninstances of planning the establishment of such controls and\nrestrictions was among the first measures taken. If such control\nwere universally practised and exercised by a single planning\nauthority, one needs little imagination to see what would\nbecome of the \"free choice of occupation\" promised. The \"free­\ndom of choice\" would be purely fictitious, a mere promise\nto practise no discrimination where in the nature of the case\ndiscrimination must be practised, and where all one could\n\f\nECONOM IC CONTROL AN 0 TOTALITARIAN ISM 99\nhope would be that the selection would be made on what the\nauthority believed to be objective grounds.\nThere would be little difference if the planning authority\nconfined itself to fixing the terms of employment and tried to\nregulate numbers by adjusting these terms. By prescribing the\nremuneration it would no less effectively bar groups of people\nfrom entering many trades than by specifically excluding them.\nA rather plain girl who badly wants to become a saleswoman, a\nweakly boy who has set his heart on a job where his weakness\nhandicaps him, as well as in general the apparently less able or\nless suitable are not necessarily excluded in a competitive soci­\nety; if they value the position sufficiently, they will frequently be\nable to get a start by a financial sacrifice and will later make good\nthrough qualities which at first are not so obvious. But when\nthe authority fixes the remuneration for a whole category and\nthe selection among the candidates is made by an objective\ntest, the strength of their desire for the job will count for very\nlittle. The person whose qualifications are not of the standard\ntype, or whose temperament is not of the ordinary kind, will no\nlonger be able to come to special arrangements with an\nemployer whose dispositions will fit in with his special needs:\nthe person who prefers irregular hours or even a happy-go­\nlucky existence with a small and perhaps uncertain income to a\nregular routine will no longer have the choice. Conditions will\nbe without exception what in some measure they inevitably are\nin a large organisation-or rather worse, because there will be\nno possibility of escape. We shall no longer be free to be rational\nor efficient only when and where we think it worth while, we\nshall all have to conform to the standards which the planning\nauthority must fix in order to simplify its task. To make this\nimmense task manageable it will have to reduce the diversity of\nhuman capacities and inclinations to a few categories of readily\ninterchangeable units and deliberately to disregard minor per­\nsonal differences.

Even a good many\neconomists with socialist views who have seriously studied the\nproblems of central planning are now content to hope that a\nplanned society will equal the efficiency of a competitive system;\nthey advocate planning no longer because of its superior\nproductivity but because it will enable us to secure a more just\nand equitable distribution of wealth. This is, indeed, the only\nargument for planning which can be seriously pressed. It is\nindisputable that if we want to secure a distribution of wealth\nwhich conforms to some predetermined standard, if we want\nconsciously to decide who is to have what, we must plan the\nwhole economic system. But the question remains whether the\nprice we should have to pay for the realisation of somebody's\nideal of justice is not bound to be more discontent and more\noppression than was ever caused by the much abused free play of\neconomic forces.\n* * * * *\nWe should be seriously deceiving ourselves if for these\napprehensions we sought comfort in the consideration that the\nimportance only in the U.S.A., though in certain years also it has been of some\nimportance in Great Britain, Germany and France, but for most of the world it\nis entirely subsidiary to the more important fact that, with productive resources\nfully employed, they can produce so little. The age of plenty will still be a long\nwhile in coming .... If preventable unemployment were eliminated through­\nout the trade cycle, this would mean a distinct improvement in the standard of\nliving of the population of the U.S.A.,but from the standpoint of the world as a\nwhole it would only make a small contribution towards the much greater\nproblem of raising the real income of the bulk of the world population to\nanything like a civilised standard.\"\n\f\nECONOMIC CONTROL AND TOTALITARIANISM 103\nadoption of central planning would merely mean a return, after\na brief spell of a free economy, to the ties and regulations which\nhave governed economic activity through most ages, and that,\ntherefore, the infringements of personal liberty need not be\ngreater than they were before the age of laissez-faire. This is a\ndangerous illusion. Even during the periods of European history\nwhen the regimentation of economic life went furthest, it\namounted to little more than the creation of a general and semi­\npermanent framework of rules within which the individual pre­\nserved a wide free sphere. The apparatus of control then available\nwould not have been adequate to impose more than very general\ndirections. And even where the control was most complete it\nextended only to those activities of a person through which he\ntook part in the social division of labour. In the much wider\nsphere in which he then still lived on his own products he was\nfree to act as he chose.\nThe situation is now entirely different. During the liberal era\nthe progressive division of labour has created a situation where\nalmost everyone of our activities is part of a social process. This\nis a development which we cannot reverse since it is only\nbecause of it that we can maintain the vastly increased popula­\ntion at anything like present standards. But, in consequence, the\nsubstitution of central planning for competition would require\ncentral direction of a much greater part of our lives than was\never attempted before. It could not stop at what we regard as our\neconomic activities, because we are now for almost every part of\nour lives dependent on somebody else's economic activities. 1\nThe passion for the \"collective satisfaction of our needs\", with\nI It is no accident that in the totalitarian countries, be it Russia or Germany or\nItaly, the question of how to organise the people's leisure should have become\na problem of planning. The Germans have even invented for this problem the\nhorrible and self-contradictory name of Freizeitgestaltung(literally: the shaping of\nthe use made of the people's free time) as if it were still, \"free time\" when it\nhas to be spent in the way ordained by authority.\n\f\n104 THE R0 AD TO S E R FDO M\nwhich our socialists have so well prepared the way for totali­\ntarianism, and which wants us to take our pleasures as well as\nour necessities at the appointed time and in the prescribed form,\nis, of course, partly intended as a means of political education.\nBut it is also the result of the exigencies of planning, which\nconsists essentially in depriving us of choice, in order to give us\nwhatever fits best into the plan and that at a time determined by\nthe plan.\nIt is often said that political freedom is meaningless without\neconomic freedom. This is true enough, but in a sense almost\nopposite from that in which the phrase is used by our planners.\nThe economic freedom which is the prerequisite of any other\nfreedom cannot be the freedom from economic care which the\nsocialists promise us and which can be obtained only by reliev­\ning the individual at the same time of the necessity and of the\npower of choice; it must be the freedom of our economic activ­\nity which, with the right of choice, inevitably also carries the\nrisk and the responsibility of that right.\n\f\n8\nWHO, WHOM?\nThe finest opportunity ever given to the world was thrown\naway because the passion for equality made vain the hope for\nfreedom.\nLord Acton.\nIt is significant that one of the commonest objections to com­\npetition is that it is \"blind\". It is not irrelevant to recall that to\nthe ancients blindness was an attribute of their deity of justice.\nAlthough competition and justice may have little else in\ncommon, it is as much a commendation of competition as of\njustice that it is no respecter of persons. That it is impossible\nto foretell who will be the lucky ones or whom disaster will\nstrike, that rewards and penalties are not shared out according\nto somebody's views about the merits or demerits of different\npeople, but depend on their capacity and their luck, is as\nimportant as that in framing legal rules we should not be able\nto predict which particular person will gain and which will\nlose by their application. And this is none the less true\nbecause in competition chance and good luck are often as\n\f\n106 THE R0 AD TO S E R FDO M\nimportant as skill and foresight in determining the fate of\ndifferent people.\nThe choice open to us is not between a system in which\neverybody will get what he deserves according to some absolute\nand universal standard of right, and one where the individual\nshares are determined partly by accident or good or ill chance,\nbut between a system where it is the will of a few persons that\ndecides who is to get what, and one where it depends at least\npartly on the ability and enterprise of the people concerned and\npartly on unforeseeable circumstances. This is no less relevant\nbecause in a system of free enterprise chances are not equal,\nsince such a system is necessarily based on private property and\n(though perhaps not with the same necessity) on inheritance,\nwith the differences in opportunity which these create. There is\nindeed a strong case for reducing this inequality of opportunity\nas far as congenital differences permit and as it is possible to do\nso without destroying the impersonal character of the process by\nwhich everybody has to take his chance and no person's view\nabout what is right and desirable overrules that of others.\nThe fact that the opportunities open to the poor in a competi­\ntive society are much more restricted than those open to the rich\ndoes not make it less true that in such a society the poor are\nmuch more free than a person commanding much greater\nmaterial comfort in a different type of society. Although under\ncompetition the probability that a man who starts poor will\nreach great wealth is much smaller than is true of the man who\nhas inherited property, it is not only possible for the former, but\nthe competitive system is the only one where it depends solely\non him and not on the favours of the mighty, and where nobody\ncan prevent a man from attempting to achieve this result. It is\nonly because we have forgotten what unfreedom means that we\noften overlook the patent fact that in every real sense a badly paid\nunskilled worker in this country has more freedom to shape his\nlife than many a small entrepreneur in Germany or a much\n\f\nWHO, WHOM? 107\nbetter paid engineer or manager in Russia. Whether it is a\nquestion of changing his job or the place where he lives, of\nprofessing certain views or of spending his leisure in a particular\nmanner, although sometimes the price he may have to pay for\nfollowing his inclinations may be high, and to many appear too\nhigh, there are no absolute impediments, no dangers to bodily\nsecurity and freedom that confine him by brute force to the task\nand the environment to which a superior has assigned him.\nThat the ideal of justice of most socialists would be satisfied if\nmerely private income from property were abolished and the\ndifferences between the earned incomes of different people\nremained what they are now, is true. 1 What these people forget is\nthat in transferring all property in the means of production to\nthe state they put the state in a position whereby its action must\nin effect decide all other incomes. The power thus given to the\nstate and the demand that the state should use it to \"plan\" means\nnothing else than that it should use it in full awareness of all\nthese effects.\nTo believe that the power which is thus conferred on the state\nis merely transferred to it from others is erroneous. It is a power\n1 It is probable that we habitually overestimate the extent to which inequality\nof incomes is mainly caused by income derived from property, and therefore\nthe extent to which the major inequalities would be abolished by abolishing\nincome from property. What little information we have about the distribution\nof incomes in Soviet Russia does not suggest that the inequalities are there\nsubstantially smaller than in a capitalist society. Max Eastman (The End of Socialism\nin Russia, 1937, pp. 30-4) gives some information from official Russian sources\nwhich suggest that the difference between the highest and the lowest salaries\npaid in Russia is of the same order of magnitude (about 50 to 1) as in the\nUnited States; and Leon Trotsky, according to an article quoted by James\nBurnham (The Managerial Revolution, 1941, p. 43), estimated as late as 1939 that\n\"the upper 11 or 12 per cent. of the Soviet population now receives approxi­\nmately SOper cent. of the national income. This differentiation is sharper than\nin the United States, where the upper 10 per cent. of the population receives\napproximately 35 per cent. of the national income. tt\n\f\n108 THE R0 AD TO S E R FDO M\nwhich is newly created and which in a competItIve society\nnobody possesses. So long as property is divided among many\nowners, none of them acting independently has exclusive power\nto determine the income and position of particular people­\nnobody is tied to him except by the fact that he may offer better\nterms than anybody else.\nWhat our generation has forgotten is that the system of pri­\nvate property is the most important guarantee of freedom, not\nonly for those who own property, but scarcely less for those who\ndo not. It is only because the control of the means of production\nis divided among many people acting independently that\nnobody has complete power over us, that we as individuals can\ndecide what to do with ourselves. If all the means of production\nwere vested in a single hand, whether it be nominally that of\n\"society\" as a whole, or that of a dictator, whoever exercises this\ncontrol has complete power over us. Who can seriously doubt\nthat a member of a small racial or religious minority will be\nfreer with no property so long as fellow members of his com­\nmunity have property and are therefore able to employ him, than\nhe would be if private property were abolished and he became\nowner of a nominal share in the communal property. Or that the\npower which a multiple millionaire, who may be my neighbour\nand perhaps my employer, has over me is very much less than\nthat which the smallest fonctionaire possesses who wields the\ncoercive power of the state and on whose discretion it depends\nwhether and how I am to be allowed to live or to work? And\nwho will deny that a world in which the wealthy are powerful is\nstill a better world than one in which only the already powerful\ncan acquire wealth?\nIt is pathetic, yet at the same time encouraging, to find as\nprominent an old communist as Mr. Max Eastman rediscovering\nthis truth:\nIt seems obvious to me now [he writes in a recent article]-\n\f\nWHO, WHO M? 109\nthough I have been slow, I must say, in coming to the\nconclusion-that the institution of private property is one of\nthe main things that have given man that limited amount of\nfree and equalness that Marx hoped to render infinite by abol­\nishing this institution. Strangely enough Marx was the first to\nsee this. He is the one who informed us, looking backwards,\nthat the evolution of private capitalism with its free market had\nbeen a precondition for the evolution of all our democratic\nfreedoms. It never occurred to him, looking forward, that if\nthis was so, these other freedoms might disappear with the\nabolition of the free market.\n1\nIt is sometimes said, in answer to such apprehensions, that\nthere is no reason why the planner should determine the\nincomes of individuals. The social and political difficulties\ninvolved in deciding the shares of different people in the\nnational income are so obvious that even the most inveterate\nplanner may well hesitate before he charges any authority with\nthis task. Probably everybody who realises what it involves\nwould prefer to confine planning to production, to use it only to\nsecure a \"rational organisation of industry\", leaving the distribu­\ntion of incomes as far as possible to impersonal forces. Although\nit is impossible to direct industry without exercising some influ­\nence on distribution, and although no planner will wish to leave\ndistribution entirely to the forces of the market, they would\npro bably all prefer to confine themselves to seeing that this\ndistribution conforms to certain general rules of equity and\nfairness, that extreme inequalities are avoided, and that the rela­\ntion between the remuneration of the major classes is just,\nwithout undertaking the responsibility for the position of\nparticular people within their class, or for the gradations and\ndifferentiations between smaller groups and individuals.\n1 Max Eastman in The Reader's Digest, July 1941 , p. 39.\n\f\n110 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nWe have already seen that the close interdependence of all\neconomic phenomena makes it difficult to stop planning just\nwhere we wish, and that, once the free working of the market is\nimpeded beyond a certain degree, the planner will be forced to\nextend his controls till they become all-comprehensive. These\neconomic considerations, which explain why it is impossible to\nstop deliberate control just where we should wish, are strongly\nreinforced by certain social or political tendencies whose\nstrength makes itself increasingly felt as planning extends.\nOnce it becomes increasingly true, and is generally recog­\nnised, that the position of the individual is determined not by\nimpersonal forces, not as a result of the competitive effort of\nmany, but by the deliberate decision of authority, the attitude of\nthe people towards their position in the social order necessarily\nchanges. There will always exist inequalities which will appear\nunjust to those who suffer from them, disappointments which\nwill appear unmerited, and strokes of misfortune which those\nhit have not deserved. But when these things occur in a society\nwhich is consciously directed, the way in which people will\nreact will be very different from what it is when they are\nnobody's conscious choice. Inequality is undoubtedly more\nreadily borne, and affects the dignity of the person much less, if\nit is determined by impersonal forces, than when it is due to\ndeSign. In a competitive society it is no slight to a person, no\noffence to his dignity, to be told by any particular firm that it has\nno need for his services, or that it cannot offer him a better job. It\nis true that in periods of prolonged mass-unemployment the\neffect on many may be very similar. But there are other and\nbetter methods to prevent that scourge than central direction.\nBut the unemployment or the loss of income which will always\naffect some in any society is certainly less degrading if it is the\nresult of misfortune and not deliberately imposed by authority.\nHowever bitter the experience, it would be very much worse in a\nplanned society. There individuals will have to decide not"

But nothing is further from the truth than that people\nin general regard mechanical equality of this kind as desirable.\nNo socialist movement which aimed at complete equality has\never gained substantial support. What socialism promised was\nnot an absolutely equal, but a more just and more equal distribu­\ntion. Not equality in the absolute sense, but \"greater equality\", is\nthe only goal which is seriously aimed at.\nThough these two ideals sound very similar, they are as differ­\nent as possible as far as our problem is concerned. While abso­\nlute equality would clearly determine the planner's task, the\ndesire for greater equality is merely negative, no more than an\nexpression of dislike of the present state of affairs; and so long as\nwe are not prepared to say that every move in the direction\ntowards complete equality is desirable, it answers scarcely any of\nthe questions the planner will have to decide.\nThis is not a quibble about words. We face here a crucial issue\nwhich the similarity of the terms used is apt to conceal. While\nagreement on complete equality would answer all the problems\nof merit the planner must answer, the formula of the approach to\ngreater equality answers practically none. Its content is hardly\nmore definite than the phrases \"common good\" or \"social wel­\nfare\". It does not free us from the necessity of deciding in every\nparticular instance between the merits of particular individuals\nor groups, and gives us no help in that decision. All it tells us in\neffect is to take from the rich as much as we can. But when it\ncomes to the distribution of the spoils, the problem is the same\nas if the formula of \"greater equality\" had never been conceived.\n* * * * *\nMost people find it difficult to admit that we do not possess\nmoral standards which would enable us to settle these\nquestions-if not perfectly, at least to greater general satisfaction\nthan is done by the competitive system. Have we not all some\n\f\nWHO, WHOM? 115\nidea of what is a \"just price\", or a \"fair wage\"? Can we not rely\non the strong sense of fairness of the people? And even if we do\nnot now agree fully on what is just or fair in a particular case,\nwould popular ideas not soon consolidate into more definite\nstandards if people were given an opportunity to see their ideals\nrealised?\nUnfortunately there is little ground for such hopes. What\nstandards we have are derived from the competitive regime we\nhave known, and would necessarily disappear soon after the dis­\nappearance of competition. What we mean by a just price, or a\nfair wage, is either the customary price or wage, the return\nwhich past experience has made people expect, or the price or\nwage that would exist if there were no monopolistic exploita­\ntion. The only important exception to this used to be the claim\nof the workers to the \"full produce of their labour\", to which so\nmuch of socialist doctrine traces back. But there are few socialists\nto-day who believe that in a socialist society the output of each\nindustry would be entirely shared by the workers of that indus­\ntry; for this would mean that workers in industries using a great\ndeal of capital would have a much larger income than those in\nindustries using little capital, which most socialists would regard\nas very unjust. And it is now fairly generally agreed that this\nparticular claim was based on an erroneous interpretation of the\nfacts. But once the claim of the individual worker to the whole of\n\"his\" product is disallowed, and the whole of the return from\ncapital is to be divided among all workers, the problem of how\nto divide it raises the same basic issue.\nWhat the \"just price\" of a particular commodity or the \"fair\"\nremuneration for a particular service is, might conceivably be\ndetermined objectively if the quantities needed were independ­\nently fixed. If these were given irrespective of cost, the planner\nmight try to find what price or wage is necessary to bring forth\nthis supply.

The idea of a political\nparty which embraces all activities of the individual from the\ncradle to the grave, which claims to guide his views on every­\nthing, and which delights in making all problems questions of\nparty-Weltanschauung,was first put into practice by the socialists.\nAn Austrian socialist writer, speaking of the socialist movement\nof his country, reports with pride that it was its \"characteristic\nfeature that it created special organisations for every field of\nactivities of workers and employees\". 1 But though the Austrian\nsocialists may have gone further in this respect than others, the\nsituation was not very different elsewhere. It was not the Fascists\nbut the socialists who began to collect children from the tender­\nest age into political organisations to make sure that they grew\nup as good proletarians. It was not the Fascists but the socialists\nwho first thought of organising sports and games, football and\nhiking, in party clubs where the members would not be infected\nby other views. It was the socialists who first insisted that the\nparty member should distinguish himself from others by the\nmodes of greeting and the forms of address. It was they who by\ntheir organisation of \"cells\" and devices for the permanent\nsupervision of private life created the prototype of the totali­\ntarian party. BaHlla and Hitlerjugend,Dopolavoroand Kraft durch Freude,\npolitical uniforms and military party formations, are all little\nmore than imitations of older socialist institutions. 2\n* * * * *\nSo long as the socialist movement in a country is closely bound\nup with the interests of a particular group, usually the more\nhighly skilled industrial workers, the problem of creating a\ncommon view on the desirable status of the different members\nI G.

The movement is immediately\nconcerned with the status of one particular group and its aim is\nto raise that status relatively to other groups. The character of the\nproblem changes, however, as in the course of the progressive\nadvance towards socialism it becomes more and more evident to\neverybody that his income and general position is determined\nby the coercive apparatus of the state, that he can maintain or\nimprove his position only as a member of an organised group\ncapable of influencing or controlling the state machine in his\ninterest. In the tug-of-war between the various pressure groups\nwhich arises at this stage, it is by no means necessary that the\ninterests of the poorest and most numerous groups should pre­\nvail. Nor is it necessarily an advantage for the older socialist\nparties, who avowedly represented the interests of a particular\ngroup, to have been the first in the field, and to have designed\ntheir whole ideology to appeal to the manual workers in indus­\ntry. Their very success, and their insistence on the acceptance\nof the whole creed, is bound to create a powerful counter­\nmovement-not by the capitalists, but by the very large and\nequally propertyless classes who find their relative status threat­\nened by the advance of the elite of the industrial workers.\nSocialist theory and socialist tactics, even where they have not\nbeen dominated by Marxist dogma, have been based everywhere\non the idea of a division of society into two classes with common\nbut mutually conflicting interests: capitalists and industrial work­\ners. Socialism counted on a rapid disappearance of the old middle\nclass and completely disregarded the rise of a new middle class,\nthe countless army of clerks and typists, administrative workers\nand school teachers, tradesmen and small officials, and the lower\nranks of the professions. For a time these classes often provided\nmany of the leaders of the labour movement. But as it became\nincreasingly clear that the position of those classes was deteriorat­\ning relatively to that of the industrial workers, the ideals which\nguided the latter lost much of their appeal to the others. While\n\f\n120 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthey were all socialists in the sense that they disliked the capitalist\nsystem and wanted a deliberate sharing out of wealth according\nto their ideas of justice, these ideas proved to be very different\nfrom those embodied in the practice of the older socialist parties.\nThe means which the old socialist parties had successfully\nemployed to secure the support of one occupational group-the\nraising of their relative economic position-cannot be used to\nsecure the support of all. There are bound to arise rival socialist\nmovements that appeal to the support of those whose relative\nposition is worsened. There is a great deal of truth in the often\nheard statement that Fascism and National Socialism are a sort of\nmiddle-class socialism-only that in Italy and Germany the sup­\nporters of these new movements were economically hardly a\nmiddle class any longer. It was to a large extent a revolt of a new\nunder-privileged class against the labour aristocracy which the\nindustrial labour movement had created. There can be little\ndoubt that no single economic factor has contributed more to\nhelp these movements than the envy of the unsuccessful profes­\nsional man, the university trained engineer or lawyer, and of the\n\"white collared proletariat\" in general, of the engine driver or\ncompositor and other members of the strongest trade unions\nwhose income was many times theirs. Nor can there be much\ndoubt that in terms of money income the average member of the\nrank and file of the Nazi movement in its early years was poorer\nthan the average trade unionist or member of the older socialist\nparty-a circumstance which only gained pOignancy from the\nfact that the former had often seen better days and were fre­\nquently still living in surroundings which were the result of this\npast. The expression \"class struggled d rebours\", current in Italy at\nthe time of the rise of Fascism, did point to a very important\naspect of the movement. The conflict between the Fascist or\nNational-Socialist and the older socialist parties must indeed very\nlargely be regarded as the kind of conflict which is bound to arise\nbetween rival socialist factions. There was no difference between\n\f\nWHO, WHOM? 121\nthem about the question of it being the will of the state which\nshould assign to each person his proper place in society. But there\nwere, as there always will be, most profound differences about\nwhat are the proper places of the different classes and groups.\n* * * * *\nThe old socialist leaders, who had always regarded their parties\nas the natural spearhead of the future general movement towards\nsocialism, found it difficult to understand that with every exten­\nsion in the use of socialist methods the resentment of large poor\nclasses should turn against them. But while the old socialist par­\nties, or the organised labour in particular industries, had usually\nnot found it unduly difficult to come to an understanding for\njoint action with the employers in their particular industries,\nvery large classes were left out in the cold. To them, and not\nwithout some justification, the more prosperous sections of the\nlabour movement seemed to belong to the exploiting rather than\nto the exploited class.\n1\nThe resentment of the lower middle class, from which Fas­\ncism and National Socialism recruited so large a proportion of\ntheir supporters, was intensified by the fact that their education\nand training had in many instances made them aspire to direct­\ning positions, and that they regarded themselves as entitled to be\nmembers of the directing class.

Lenin, 1917.\nIn a country where the sole employer is the State, opposition\nmeans death by slow starvation. The old principle: who does\nnot work shall not eat, has been replaced by a new one: who\ndoes not obey shall not eat.\nL. Trotsky, 1937.\nLike the spurious \"economic freedom\", and with more justice,\neconomic security is often represented as an indispensable con­\ndition of real liberty. In a sense this is both true and important.\nIndependence of mind or strength of character are rarely found\namong those who cannot be confident that they will make their\nway by their own effort. Yet the idea of economic security is no\nless vague and ambiguous than most other terms in this field;\nand because of this the general approval given to the demand for\nsecurity may become a danger to liberty. Indeed, when security\nis understood in too absolute a sense, the general striving for it,\n\f\n124 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nfar from increasing the chances of freedom, becomes the gravest\nthreat to it.\nIt will be well to contrast at the outset the two kinds of secur­\nity: the limited one, which can be achieved for all, and which is\ntherefore no privilege but a legitimate object of desire; and the\nabsolute security which in a free society cannot be achieved for\nall and which ought not to be given as a privilege-except in a\nfew special instances such as that of the judges, where complete\nindependence is of paramount importance. These two kinds of\nsecurity are, first, security against severe physical privation, the\ncertainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all; and, sec­\nondly, the security of a given standard of life, or of the relative\nposition which one person or group enjoys compared with\nothers; or, as we may put it briefly, the security of a minimum\nincome and the security of the particular income a person is\nthought to deserve. We shall presently see that this distinction\nlargely coincides with the distinction between the security\nwhich can be provided for all outside of and supplementary to\nthe market system, and the security which can be provided only\nfor some and only by controlling or abolishing the market.\nThere is no reason why in a society that has reached the\ngeneral level of wealth which ours has attained, the first kind of\nsecurity should not be guaranteed to all without endangering\ngeneral freedom. There are difficult questions about the precise\nstandard which should thus be assured; there is particularly the\nimportant question whether those who thus rely on the com­\nmunity should indefinitely enjoy all the same liberties as the\nrest. 1 An incautious handling of these questions might well\ncause serious and perhaps even dangerous political problems;\nbut there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter,\nI There are also serious problems of international relations which arise if mere\ncitizenship of a country confers the right to a standard of living higher than\nelsewhere, and which ought not to be dismissed too lightly.\n\f\nSECURITY AND FREEDOM 125\nand clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to\nwork, can be assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable\npart of the population of this country this sort of security has\nlong been achieved.\nNor is there any reason why the state should not assist the\nindividuals in providing for those common hazards of life\nagainst which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can\nmake adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and\naccident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the\nefforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened\nby the provision of assistance, where, in short, we deal with\ngenuinely insurable risks, the case for the state helping to organ­\nise a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.\nThere are many points of detail where those wishing to preserve\nthe competitive system and those wishing to supersede it by\nsomething different will disagree on the details of such schemes;\nand it is possible under the name of social insurance to introduce\nmeasures which tend to make competition more or less ineffect­\nive. But there is no incompatibility in principle between the state\nproviding greater security in this way and the preservation of\nindividual freedom. To the same category belongs also the\nincrease of security through the state rendering assistance to the\nvictims of such \"acts of God\" as earthquakes and floods. Wher­\never communal action can mitigate disasters against which the\nindividual can neither attempt to guard himself, nor make provi­\nsion for the consequences, such communal action should\nundoubtedly be taken.\nThere is, finally, the supremely important problem of combat­\ning general fluctuations of economic activity and the recurrent\nwaves of large-scale unemployment which accompany them.\nThis is, of course, one of the gravest and most pressing problems\nof our time. But, though its solution will require much planning\nin the good sense, it does not-or at least need not-require that\nspecial kind of planning which according to its advocates is to\n\f\n126 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nreplace the market. Many economists hope indeed that the\nultimate remedy may be found in the field of monetary policy,\nwhich would involve nothing incompatible even with\nnineteenth-century liberalism. Others, it is true, believe that real\nsuccess can be expected only from the skilful timing of public\nworks undertaken on a very large scale. This might lead to much\nmore serious restrictions of the competitive sphere, and in\nexperimenting in this direction we shall have carefully to\nwatch our step if we are to avoid making all economic activity\nprogressively more dependent on the direction and volume of\ngovernment expenditure. But this is neither the only, nor, in my\nopinion, the most promising way of meeting the gravest threat\nto economic security. In any case, the very necessary efforts to\nsecure protection against these fluctuations do not lead to the\nkind of planning which constitutes such a threat to our freedom.\n* * * * *\nThe planning for security which has such an insidious effect on\nliberty is that for security of a different kind. It is planning\ndesigned to protect individuals or groups against diminutions of\ntheir income which although in no way deserved yet in a com­\npetitive society occur daily, against losses imposing severe hard­\nships having no moral justification yet inseparable from the\ncompetitive system. This demand for security is thus another\nform of the demand for a just remuneration, a remuneration\ncommensurate with the subjective merits and not with the\nobjective results of a man's efforts. This kind of security or justice\nseems irreconcilable with freedom to choose one's employment.\nIn any system which for the distribution of men between the\ndifferent trades and occupations relies on their own choice it is\nnecessary that the remuneration in these trades should corre­\nspond to their usefulness to the other members of society, even\nif this should stand in no relation to subjective merit. Although\nthe results achieved will often be commensurate with efforts and\n\f\nSEC URI TV AND F R EEDO M 127\nintentions, this cannot always be true in any form of society. It\nwill particularly not be true in the many instances where the\nusefulness of some trade or special skill is changed by circum­\nstances which could not be foreseen. We all know the tragic\nplight of the highly trained man whose hard-learned skill has\nsuddenly lost its value because of some invention which greatly\nbenefits the rest of society. The history of the last hundred years\nis full of instances of this kind, some of them affecting hundreds\nof thousands of people at a time.\nThat anybody should suffer a great diminution of his income\nand bitter disappointment of all his hopes through no fault of his\nown, and despite hard work and exceptional skill, undoubtedly\noffends our sense of justice. The demands of those who suffer in\nthis way, for state interference on their behalf to safeguard their\nlegitimate expectations, are certain to receive popular sympathy\nand support. The general approval of these demands has had the\neffect that governments everywhere have taken action, not\nmerely to protect the people so threatened from severe hardship\nand privation, but to secure to them the continued receipt of\ntheir former income and to shelter them from the vicissitudes of\nthe market.\n1\nCertainty of a given income can, however, not be given to all if\nany freedom in the choice of one's occupation is to be allowed.\nAnd if it is provided for some it becomes a privilege at the\nexpense of others whose security is thereby necessarily dimin­\nished. That security of an invariable income can be provided for\nall only by the abolition of all freedom in the choice of one's\nemployment is easily shown. Yet, although such a general guar­\nantee of legitimate expectation is often regarded as the ideal to\nbe aimed at, it is not a thing which is seriously attempted. What\nI Very interesting suggestions of how these hardships might be mitigated\nwithin a liberal society, have recently been put forward by Professor W H. Hutt\nin a book, which will repay careful study (Plan for Reconstruction,1943).\n\f\n128 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nis constantly being done is to grant this kind of security piece­\nmeal, to this group and to that, with the result that for those who\nare left out in the cold the insecurity constantly increases. No\nwonder that in consequence the value attached to the privilege\nof security constantly increases, the demand for it becomes more\nand more urgent, till in the end no price, not even that of liberty,\nappears too high.\n* * * * *\nIf those whose usefulness is reduced by circumstances which\nthey could neither foresee nor control were to be protected\nagainst undeserved loss, and those whose usefulness has been\nincreased in the same way were prevented from making an\nunmerited gain, remuneration would soon cease to have any\nrelation to actual usefulness. It would depend on the views held\nby some authority about what a person ought to have done,\nwhat he ought to have foreseen, and how good or bad his inten­\ntions were. Such decisions could not but be to a large extent\narbitrary. The application of this principle would necessarily\nbring it about that people doing the same work would receive\ndifferent remuneration. The differences in remuneration would\nthen no longer present an adequate inducement to people to\nmake the changes which are socially desirable and it would not\neven be possible for the individuals affected to judge whether a\nparticular change is worth the trouble it causes.\nBut if the changes in the distribution of men between differ­\nent employments, which are constantly necessary in any society,\ncan no longer be brought about by pecuniary \"rewards\" and\n\"penalties\" (which have no necessary connection with subject­\nive merit), they must be brought about by direct orders. When a\nperson's income is guaranteed he can neither be allowed to stay\nin his job merely because he likes it, nor to choose what\nother work he would like to do.

But this, although important,\nis not the whole, nor even the most important, aspect of the\nproblem. It is not merely that if we want people to give their best\nwe must make it worth while for them. What is more important\nis that if we want to leave them the choice, if they are to be able\nto judge what they ought to do, they must be given some readily\nintelligible yardstick by which to measure the social importance\nof the different occupations. Even with the best will in the world\nit would be impossible for anyone intelligently to choose\nbetween various alternatives if the advantages they offered him\nstood in no relation to their usefulness to society. To know\nwhether as the result of a change a man ought to leave a trade\nand an environment which he has come to like, and exchange\nit for another, it is necessary that the changed relative value\nof these occupations to society should find expression in the\nremunerations they offer.\nThe problem is, of course, even more important because in.~\nthe world as it is men are, in fact, not likely to give their best for\nlong periods unless their own interests are directly involved.

The application of the engineering\ntechnique to a whole nation-and this is what planning\nmeans-ccraises problems of discipline which are hard to solve\",\nas has been well described by an American engineer with great\nexperience in government planning, who has clearly seen the\nproblem.\nIn order to do an engineering job, [he explains], there ought\n\f\n130 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nto be surrounding the work a comparatively large area of\nunplanned economic action. There should be a place from\nwhich workers can be drawn, and when a worker is fired he\nshould vanish from the job and from the pay-roll. In the\nabsence of such a free reservoir discipline cannot be main­\ntained without corporal punishment, as with slave labour.'\nIn the sphere of executive work the problem of sanctions for\nnegligence arises in a different but no less serious form. It has\nbeen well said that while the last resort of a competitive econ­\nomy is the bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is\nthe hangman. 2 The powers the manager of any plant will have to\nbe given will still be considerable. But no more than in the case\nof the worker can the manager's position and income in a\nplanned system be made to depend merely on the success or\nfailure of the work under his direction. As neither the risk nor\nthe gain is his, it cannot be his personal judgment, but whether\nhe does what he ought to have done according to some estab­\nlished rule, which must decide. A mistake he \"ought\" to have\navoided is not his own affair, it is a crime against the community\nand must be treated as such. While so long as he keeps to the safe\npath of objectively ascertainable duty he may be surer of his\nincome than the capitalist entrepreneur, the danger which\nthreatens him in case of real failure is worse than bankruptcy. He\nmay be economically secure so long as he satisfies his superiors,\nbut this security is bought at the price of the safety of freedom\nand life.\nThe conflict with which we have to deal is indeed a quite\nfundamental one between two irreconcilable types of social\norganisation, which, from the most characteristic forms in\n1 D.

    "raw_text": "SECURITY AND FREEDOM 131\nwhich they appear, have often been described as the commercial\nand the military type of society. The terms were, perhaps,\nunfortunate, because they direct attention to unessentials and\nmake it difficult to see that we face here a real alternative and that\nthere is no third possibility. Either both the choice and the risk\nrest with the individual or he is relieved of both. The army does\nindeed in many ways represent the closest approach familiar to\nus to the second type of organisation, where work and worker\nalike are allotted by authority and where, if the available means\nare scanty, everybody is alike put on short commons. This is the\nonly system in which the individual can be conceded full eco­\nnomic security and through the extension of which to the whole\nof society it can be achieved for all its members. This security is,\nhowever, inseparable from the restrictions on liberty and the\nhierarchical order of military life-it is the security of the\nbarracks.\nIt is possible, of course, to organise sections of an otherwise\nfree society on this principle and there is no reason why this\nform of life, with its necessary restrictions on individual liberty ,\nshould not be open to those who prefer it. Indeed, some volun­\ntary labour service on military lines might well be the best form\nfor the state to provide the certainty of an opportunity for work\nand a minimum income for all. That proposals of this sort have\nin the past proved so little acceptable is due to the fact that those\nwho are willing to surrender their freedom for security have\nalways demanded that if they give up their full freedom it should\nalso be taken from those not prepared to do so. For this claim it is\ndifficult to find a justification.\nThe military type of organisation as we know it gives us,\nhowever, only a very inadequate picture of what it would be like\nif it were extended to the whole of society. So long as only a part\nof society is organised on military lines, the unfreedom of the\nmembers of the military organisation is mitigated by the fact\nthat there is still a free sphere to which they can move if the\n\f\n132 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nrestrictions become too irksome. If we want to form a picture of\nwhat society would be like if, according to the ideal which has\nseduced so many socialists, it was organised as a single great\nfactory, we have to look to ancient Sparta, or to contemporary\nGermany, which after moving for two or three generations in\nthis direction, has now so nearly reached it.\n* * * * *\nIn a society used to freedom it is unlikely that many people\nwould be ready deliberately to purchase security at this price.\nBut the policies which are now followed everywhere, which\nhand out the privilege of security, now to this group and now to\nthat, are nevertheless rapidly creating conditions in which the\nstriving for security tends to become stronger than the love of\nfreedom. The reason for this is that with every grant of complete\nsecurity to one group the insecurity of the rest necessarily\nincreases. If you guarantee to some a fixed part of a variable cake,\nthe share left to the rest is bound to fluctuate proportionally\nmore than the size of the whole. And the essential element of\nsecurity which the competitive system offers, the great variety of\nopportunities, is more and more reduced.\nWithin the market system, security can be granted to particu­\nlar groups only by the kind of planning known as restrictionism\n(which includes, however, almost all the planning which is actu­\nally practised!). \"Control\", i.e. limitation of output so that prices\nwill secure an \"adequate\" return, is the only way in which in a\nmarket economy producers can be guaranteed a certain income.\nBut this necessarily involves a reduction of opportunities open to\nothers. If the producer, be he entrepreneur or worker, is to be\nprotected against underbidding by outsiders, it means that\nothers who are worse off are precluded from sharing in the\nrelatively greater prosperity of the controlled industries. Every\nrestriction on the freedom of entry into a trade reduces the\nsecurity of all those outside it. And as the number of those\n\f\nSECURITY AND FREEDOM 133\nwhose income is secured in this manner increases, the field of\nalternative opportunities is restricted which are open to anyone\nwho suffers a loss of income; and for those unfavourably affected\nby any change the chance of avoiding a fatal diminution of their\nincome is correspondingly diminished. And if, as has become\nincreasingly true, in each trade in which conditions improve, the\nmembers are allowed to exclude others in order to secure to\nthemselves the full gain in the form of higher wages or profits,\nthose in the trades where demand has fallen have nowhere to go\nand every change becomes the cause of large unemployment.\nThere can be little doubt that it is largely a consequence of the\nstriving for security by these means in the last decades that\nunemployment and thus insecurity for large sections of the\npopulation has so much increased.\nIn this country such restrictions, especially those affecting the\nintermediate strata of society, have assumed important dimen­\nsions only in comparatively recent times, and we have scarcely\nyet realised their full consequences. The utter hopelessness of the\nposition of those who, in a society which has thus grown rigid,\nare left outside the range of sheltered occupation, and the magni­\ntude of the gulf which separates them from the fortunate posses­\nsor of jobs for whom protection against competition has made it\nunnecessary to budge ever so little to make room for those with­\nout can only be appreciated by those who have experienced it. It\nis not a question of the fortunate ones giving up their places, but\nmerely that they should share in the common misfortune by\nsome reduction of their incomes, or frequently even merely by\nsome sacrifice of their prospects of improvement. The protection\nof their \"standard of life\" , of the \"fair price\", or the \"professional\nincome\" to which they regard themselves as entitled, and in the\nprotection of which they receive the support of the state, pre­\ncludes this. In consequence, instead of prices, wages, and indi­\nvidual incomes, it is now employment and production which\nhave become subject to violent fluctuations. There has never been\n\f\n134 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\na worse and more cruel exploitation of one class by another than\nthat of the weaker or less fortunate members of a group of pro­\nducers by the well-established which has been made possible by\nthe \"regulation\" of competition. Few catchwords have done so\nmuch harm as the ideal of a \"stabilisation\" of particular prices\n(or wages) which, while securing the income of some, makes the\nposition of the rest more and more precarious.\nThus, the more we try to provide full security by interfering\nwith the market system, the greater the insecurity becomes; and,\nwhat is worse, the greater becomes the contrast between the\nsecurity of those to whom it is granted as a privilege and the\never-increasing insecurity of the under-privileged And the more\nsecurity becomes a privilege, and the greater the danger to those\nexcluded from it, the higher will security be prized. As the num­\nber of the privileged increases and the difference between their\nsecurity and the insecurity of the others increases, a completely\nnew set of social values gradually arises. It is no longer\nindependence but security which gives rank and status, the cer­\ntain right to a pension more than confidence in his making good\nwhich makes a young man eligible for marriage, while insecur­\nity becomes the dreaded state of the pariah in which those who\nin their youth have been refused admission to the haven of a\nsalaried position remain for life.\n* * * * *\nThe general endeavour to achieve security by restrictive meas­\nures, tolerated or supported by the state, has in the course of\ntime produced a progressive transformation of society-a trans­\nformation in which, as in so many other ways, Germany has led\nand the other countries have followed. This development has\nbeen hastened by another effect of socialist teaching, the delib­\nerate disparagement of all activities involving economic risk and\nthe moral opprobrium cast on the gains which make risks worth\ntaking but which only few can win. We cannot blame our young\n\f\nSECURITY AND FREEDOM 135\nmen when they prefer the safe, salaried position to the risk of\nenterprise after they have heard from their earliest youth the\nformer described as the superior, more unselfish and disinter­\nested occupation. The younger generation of to-day has grown\nup in a world in which in school and press the spirit of com­\nmercial enterprise has been represented as disreputable and the\nmaking of profit as immoral, where to employ a hundred people\nis represented as exploitation but to command the same number\nas honourable. Older people may regard this as an exaggeration\nof the present state of affairs, but the daily experience of the\nUniversity teacher leaves little doubt that as a result of anti­\ncapitalist propaganda values have already altered far in advance\nof the change in institutions which has yet taken place in this\ncountry. The question is whether by changing our institutions to\nsatisfy the new demands, we shall not unwittingly destroy values\nwhich we still rate higher.\nThe change in the structure of society involved in the victory\nof the ideal of security over that of independence cannot be\nbetter illustrated than by a comparison of what ten or twenty\nyears ago could still be regarded as the English and the German\ntype of society. However great the influence of the army may\nhave been in the latter country, it is a grave mistake to ascribe\nwhat the Englishman regarded as the \"military\" character of\nGerman society mainly to that influence. The difference went\nmuch deeper than could be explained on that ground, and the\npeculiar attributes of German society existed no less in circles in\nwhich the properly military influence was negligible than in\nthose in which it was strong. It was not so much that at almost all\ntimes a larger part of the German people was organised for war\nthan was true in other countries, but that the same type of\norganisation was employed for so many other purposes, which\ngave German society its peculiar character. It was that a larger\npart of the civil life of Germany than of any other country was\ndeliberately organised from the top, that so large a proportion of\n\f\n136 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nher people did not regard themselves as independent but as\nappointed functionaries, which gave her social structure its\npeculiar character. Germany had, as the Germans themselves\nboasted, for long been a Beamtenstaatin which not only in the\nCivil Service proper but in almost all spheres of life income and\nstatus were assigned and guaranteed by some authority.\nWhile it is doubtful whether the spirit of freedom can any­\nwhere be extirpated by force, it is not certain that any people\nwould successfully withstand the process by which it was slowly\nsmothered in Germany. Where distinction and rank is achieved\nalmost exclusively by becoming a salaried servant of the state,\nwhere to do one's assigned duty is regarded as more laudable\nthan to choose one's own field of usefulness, where all pursuits\nthat do not give a recognised place in the official hierarchy or a\nclaim to a fixed income are regarded as inferior and even some­\nwhat disreputable, it is too much to expect that many will long\nprefer freedom to security. And where the alternative to security\nin a dependent position is a most precarious position, in which\none is despised alike for success and for failure, only few will\nresist the temptation of safety at the price of freedom. Once\nthings have gone so far, liberty indeed becomes almost a mock­\nery, since it can be purchased only by the sacrifice of most of the\ngood things of this earth. In this state it is little surprising that\nmore and more people should come to feel that without eco­\nnomic security liberty is \"not worth having\" and that they are\nwilling to sacrifice their liberty for security. But it is disquieting\nto find Professor Harold Laskiin this country employing the very\nsame argument which has perhaps done more than any other to\ninduce the German people to sacrifice their liberty. 1\n1 H. J. Laski, Liberty in the Modern State (Pelican edition 1937, p. 51): \"Those who\nknow the normal life of the poor, its haunting sense of impending disaster, its\nfitful search for beauty which perpetually eludes, will realise well enough that,\nwithout economic security, liberty is not worth having.\"\n\f\nSECURITY AND FREEDOM 137\nThere can be no question that adequate security against severe\nprivation, and the reduction of the avoidable causes of mis­\ndirected effort and consequent disappointment, will have to be\none of the main goals of policy. But if these endeavours are to be\nsuccessful and not to destroy individual freedom, security must\nbe provided outside the market and competition be left to func­\ntion unobstructed. Some security is essential if freedom is to be\npreserved, because most men are willing to bear the risk which\nfreedom inevitably involves only so long as that risk is not too\ngreat. But while this is a truth of which we must never lose sight,\nnothing is more fatal than the present fashion among intellectual\nleaders of extolling security at the expense of freedom. It is\nessential that we should re-Iearn frankly to face the fact that\nfreedom can only be had at a price and that as individuals we\nmust be prepared to make severe material sacrifices to preserve\nour liberty. If we want to retain this we must regain the convic­\ntion on which the rule of liberty in the Anglo-Saxon countries\nhas been based and which Benjamin Franklin expressed in a\nphrase applicable to us in our lives as individuals no less than as\nnations: \"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase\na little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"\n\f\n10\nWHY THE WORST GET ON TOP\nAll power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nLord Acton.\nWe must now examine a belief from which many who regard\nthe advent of totalitarianism as inevitable derive consolation and\nwhich seriously weakens the resistance of many others who\nwould oppose it with all their might if they fully apprehended its\nnature. It is the belief that the most repellent features of the\ntotalitarian regimes are due to the historical accident that they\nwere established by groups of blackguards and thugs. Surely, it is\nargued, if in Germany the creation of a totalitarian regime\nbrought the Streichers and Killingers, the Leys and Heines, the\nHimmlers and Heydrichs to power, this may prove the vicious­\nness of the German character, but not that the rise of such people\nis the necessary consequence of a totalitarian system. Why\nshould it not be possible that the same sort of system, if it be\nnecessary to achieve important ends, be run by decent people for\nthe good of the community as a whole?\n\f\nWHY THE WORST GET ON TOP 139\nWe must not deceive ourselves into believing that all good\npeople must be democrats or will necessarily wish to have a\nshare in the government. Many, no doubt, would rather entrust\nit to somebody whom they think more competent. Although this\nmight be unwise, there is nothing bad or dishonourable in\napproving a dictatorship of the good. Totalitarianism, we can\nalready hear it argued, is a powerful system alike for good and\nevil, and the purpose for which it will be used depends entirely\non the dictators. And those who think that it is not the system\nwhich we need fear, but the danger that it might be run by bad\nmen, might even be tempted to forestall this danger by seeing\nthat it is established in time by good men.\nNo doubt an English \"fascist\" system would greatly differ\nfrom the Italian or German models; no doubt if the transition\nwere effected without violence, we might expect to get a\nbetter type of leader. And if I had to live under a fascist system\nI have no doubt that I would rather live under one run by\nEnglishmen than under one run by anybody else. Yet all this\ndoes not mean that, judged on our present standards, a British\nfascist system would in the end prove so very different or\nmuch less intolerable than its prototypes. There are strong\nreasons for believing that what to us appear the worst features\nof the existing totalitarian systems are not accidental by­\nproducts, but phenomena which totalitarianism is certain\nsooner or later to produce. Just as the democratic statesman\nwho sets out to plan economic life will soon be confronted\nwith the alternative of either assuming dictatorial powers or\nabandoning his plans, so the totalitarian dictator would soon\nhave to choose between disregard of ordinary morals and fail­\nure. It is for this reason that the unscrupulous and uninhibited\nare likely to be more successful in a society tending towards\ntotalitarianism. Who does not see this has not yet grasped the\nfull width of the gulf which separates totalitarianism from a\nliberal regime, the utter difference between the whole moral"

    "raw_text": "140 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\natmosphere under collectivism and the essentially individualist\nWestern civilisation.\nThe \"moral basis of collectivism\" has, of course, been much\ndebated in the past; but what concerns us here is not its moral\nbasis but its moral results. The usual discussions of the ethical\naspects of collectivism refer to the question whether collectivism\nis demanded by existing moral convictions; or what moral con­\nvictions would be required if collectivism is to produce the\nhoped-for results. Our question, however, is what moral views\nwill be produced by a collectivist organisation of society, or\nwhat views are likely to rule it. The interaction between morals\nand institutions may well have the effect that the ethics produced\nby collectivism will be altogether different from the moral ideals\nthat lead to the demand for collectivism. While we are apt to\nthink that, since the desire for a collectivist system springs from\nhigh moral motives, such a system must be the breeding ground\nfor the highest virtues, there is, in fact, no reason why any sys­\ntem should necessarily enhance those attitudes which serve the\npurpose for which it was designed. The ruling moral views will\ndepend partly on the qualities that will lead individuals to suc­\ncess in a collectivist or totalitarian system, and partly on the\nrequirements of the totalitarian machinery.\n* * * * *\nWe must here return for a moment to the position which\nprecedes the suppression of democratic institutions and the cre­\nation of a totalitarian regime. In this stage it is the general\ndemand for quick and determined government action that is the\ndominating element in the situation, dissatisfaction with the\nslow and cumbersome course of democratic procedure which\nmakes action for action's sake the goal. It is then the man or the\nparty who seems strong and resolute enough \"to get things\ndone\" who exercises the greatest appeal. \"Strong\" in this sense\nmeans not merely a numerical majority-it is the ineffectiveness\n\f\nWHYTHEWORSTGETONTOP 141\nof parliamentary majorities with which people are dissatisfied.\nWhat they will seek is somebody with such solid support as to\ninspire confidence that he can carry out whatever he wants. It is\nhere that the new type of party, organised on military lines,\ncomes in.\nIn the Central European countries the socialist parties had\nfamiliarised the masses with political organisations of a semi­\nmilitary character designed to absorb as much as possible of the\nprivate life of the members. All that was wanted to give one\ngroup overwhelming power was to carry the same principle\nsomewhat further, to seek strength not in the assured votes of\nhuge numbers at occasional elections, but in the absolute and\nunreserved support of a smaller but more thoroughly organised\nbody. The chance of imposing a totalitarian regime on a whole\npeople depends on the leader first collecting round him a group\nwhich is prepared voluntarily to submit to that totalitarian\ndiscipline which they are to impose by force upon the rest.\nAlthough the socialist parties had the strength to get anything\nif they had cared to use force, they were reluctant to do so. They\nhad, without knowing it, set themselves a task which only the\nruthless, ready to disregard the barriers of accepted morals, can\nexecute.\nThat socialism can be put into practice only by methods\nwhich most socialists disapprove is, of course, a lesson learnt by\nmany social reformers in the past. The old socialist parties were\ninhibited by their democratic ideals, they did not possess the\nruthlessness required for the performance of their chosen task. It\nis characteristic that both in Germany and Italy the success of\nFascism was preceded by the refusal of the socialist parties to\ntake over the responsibilities of government. They were unwill­\ning wholeheartedly to employ the methods to which they had\npointed the way. They still hoped for the miracle of a majority\nagreeing on a particular plan for the organisation of the whole of\nsociety; others had already learnt the lesson that in a planned\n\f\n142 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nsociety the question can no longer be on what a majority of the\npeople agree, but what is the largest single group whose mem­\nbers agree sufficiently to make unified direction of all affairs\npossible; or, if no such group large enough to enforce its views\nexists, how it can be created and who will succeed in creating it.\nThere are three main reasons why such a numerous and\nstrong group with fairly homogeneous views is not likely to be\nformed by the best but rather by the worst elements of any\nsociety. By our standards the principles on which such a group\nwould be selected will be almost entirely negative.\nIn the first instance, it is probably true that in general the\nhigher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes,\nthe more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less\nlikely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values. It is a\ncorollary of this that if we wish to find a high degree of uniform­\nity and similarity of outlook, we have to descend to the regions\nof lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primi­\ntive and \"common\" instincts and tastes prevail. This does not\nmean that the majority of people have low moral standards; it\nmerely means that the largest group of people whose values are\nvery similar are the people with low standards. It is, as it were,\nthe lowest common denominator which unites the largest num­\nber of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to\nimpose their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will\nnever be those with highly differentiated and developed tastes­\nit will be those who form the \"mass\" in the derogatory sense of\nthe term, the least original and independent, who will be able to\nput the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals.\nIf, however, a potential dictator had to rely entirely on those\nwhose uncomplicated and primitive instincts happen to be very\nsimilar, their number would scarcely give sufficient weight to\ntheir endeavours. He will have to increase their numbers by\nconverting more to the same simple creed.\nHere comes in the second negative principle of selection: he\n\f\nWHY THE WORST GET ON TOP 143\nwill be able to obtain the support of all the docile and gullible,\nwho have no strong convictions of their own but are prepared to\naccept a ready-made system of values if it is only drummed into\ntheir ears suffiCiently loudly and frequently. It will be those\nwhose vague and imperfectly formed ideas are easily swayed and\nwhose passions and emotions are readily aroused who will thus\nswell the ranks of the totalitarian party.\nIt is in connection with the deliberate effort of the skilful\ndemagogue to weld together a closely coherent and homo­\ngeneous body of supporters that the third and perhaps most\nimportant negative element of selection enters. It seems to be\nalmost a law of human nature that it is easier for people to agree\non a negative programme, on the hatred of an enemy, on the\nenvy of those better off, than on any positive task. The contrast\nbetween the \"we\" and the \"they\", the common fight against\nthose outside the group, seems to be an essential ingredient in\nany creed which will solidly knit together a group for common\naction. It is consequently always employed by those who seek,\nnot merely support of a policy, but the unreserved allegiance of\nhuge masses. From their point of view it has the great advantage\nof leaving them greater freedom of action than almost any posi­\ntive programme. The enemy, whether he be internal like the\n\"Jew\" or the \"Kulak\", or external, seems to be an indispensable\nrequisite in the armoury of a totalitarian leader.\nThat in Germany it was the Jew who became the enemy till his\nplace was taken by the \"plutocracies\" was no less a result of the\nanti-capitalist resentment on which the whole movement was\nbased than the selection of the Kulak in Russia. In Germany and\nAustria the Jew had come to be regarded as the representative of\ncapitalism because a traditional dislike of large classes of the\npopulation for commercial pursuits had left these more readily\naccessible to a group that was practically excluded from the\nmore highly esteemed occupations. It is the old story of the alien\nrace being admitted only to the less respected trades and then\n\f\n144 THE R0 AD TO S E RFDO M\nbeing hated still more for practising them. The fact that German\nanti-semitism and anti-capitalism spring from the same root is\nof great importance for the understanding of what has happened\nthere, but this is rarely grasped by foreign observers.\n* * * * *\nTo treat the universal tendency of collectivist policy to become\nnationalistic as due entirely to the necessity for securing\nunhesitating support would be to neglect another and no less\nimportant factor. It may indeed be questioned whether anybody\ncan realistically conceive of a collectivist programme other than\nin the service of a limited group, whether collectivism can exist\nin any other form than that of some kind of particularism, be it\nnationalism, racialism, or class-ism. The belief in the community\nof aims and interests with fellow-men seems to presuppose a\ngreater degree of similarity of outlook and thought than exists\nbetween men merely as human beings. If the other members of\none's group cannot all be personally known, they must at least\nbe of the same kind as those around us, think and talk in the\nsame way and about the same kind of things, in order that we\nmay identify ourselves with them. Collectivism on a world scale\nseems to be unthinkable-except in the service of a small ruling\nelite. It would certainly raise not only technical but above all\nmoral problems which none of our socialists are willing to face.\nIf the English proletarian is entitled to an equal share of the\nincome now derived from England's capital resources, and of\nthe control of their use, because they are the result of exploita­\ntion, so on the same principle all the Indians would be entitled\nnot only to the income from but also to the use of a proportional\nshare of the British capital. But what socialists seriously contem­\nplate the equal division of existing capital resources among the\npeople of the world? They all regard the capital as belonging not\nto humanity but to the nation-though even within the nation\nfew would dare to advocate that the richer regions should be\n\f\nWHYTHEWORSTGETONTOP 145\ndeprived of some of \"their\" capital equipment in order to help\nthe poorer regions. What socialists proclaim as a duty towards\nthe fellow members of the existing states, they are not prepared\nto grant to the foreigner. From a consistent collectivist point of\nview the claims of the \"Have-Not\" nations for a new division of\nthe world are entirely justified-though, if consistently applied,\nthose who demand it most loudly would lose by it almost as\nmuch as the richest nations. They are, therefore, careful not to\nbase their claims on any equalitarian principles but on their\npretended superior capacity to organise other peoples.\nOne of the inherent contradictions of the collectivist philo­\nsophy is, that while basing itself on the humanistic morals which\nindividualism has developed, it is practicable only within a rela­\ntively small group. That socialism so long as it remains theor­\netical, is internationalist, while as soon as it is put into practice,\nwhether in Russia or in Germany, it becomes violently national­\nist, is one of the reasons why \"liberal socialism\" as most people\nin the Western world imagine it is purely theoretical, while the\npractice of socialism is everywhere totalitarian. 1 Collectivism has\nno room for the wide humanitarianism of liberalism but only\nfor the narrow particularism of the totalitarian.\nIf the \"community\" or the state are prior to the individual, if\nthey have ends of their own independent of and superior to\nthose of the individuals, only those individuals who work for the\nsame ends can be regarded as members of the community. It is a\nnecessary consequence of this view that a person is respected\nonly as a member of the group, that is, only if and in so far as he\nworks for the recognised common ends, and that he derives his\nwhole dignity only from this membership and not merely from\nbeing man. Indeed, the very concepts of humanity and therefore\nof any form of internationalism are entirely products of the\nI Cf. now the instructive discussion in F. Borkenau, Socialism, National or\nInternational?,1942.\n\f\n146 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nindividualist view of man, and there can be no place for them in\na collectivist system of thought.}\nApart from the basic fact that the community of collectivism\ncan extend only as far as the unity of purpose of the individuals\nexists or can be created, several contributory factors strengthen\nthe tendency of collectivism to become particularist and\nexclusive. Of these one of the most important is that the desire of\nthe individual to identify himself with a group is very frequently\nthe result of a feeling of inferiority, and that therefore his want\nwill only be satisfied if membership of the group confers some\nsuperiority over outsiders. Sometimes, it seems, the very fact that\nthese violent instincts which the individual knows he must curb\nwithin the group can be given a free range in the collective\naction towards the outsider, becomes a further inducement for\nmerging personality in that of the group. There is a profound\ntruth expressed in the title of R. Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral\nSociety-however little we can follow him in the conclusions he\ndraws from his thesis. There is indeed, as he says elsewhere, \"an\nincreasing tendency among modern men to imagine themselves\nethical because they have delegated their vices to larger and\nlarger groups.\"2 To act on behalf of a group seems to free people\nof many of the moral restraints which control their behaviour as\nindividuals within the group.\nThe definitely antagonistic attitude which most planners take\ntowards internationalism is further explained by the fact that in\nI It is entirely in the spirit of collectivism when Nietzsche makes his\nZarathustra say:\n\"A thousand goals have existed hitherto, for a thousand people existed. But\nthe fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking, the one goal is still lacking.\nHumanity has no goal yet.\n\"But tell me, I pray, my brethren: if the goal be lacking to humanity, is not\nhumanity itself lacking?\"\n2 Quoted from an article of Dr. Niebuhr's by E. H. Carr, The Twenty Years' Crisis,\n1941, p. 203.\n\f\nWHY THE WORST GET ON TOP 147\nthe existing world all outside contacts of a group are obstacles to\ntheir effectively planning the sphere in which they can attempt\nit. It is therefore no accident that, as the editor of one of the most\ncomprehensive collective studies on planning has discovered to\nhis chagrin, \"most 'planners' are militant nationalists\" .I\nThe nationalist and imperialist propensities of socialist plan­\nners' much more common than is generally recognised, are not\nalways as flagrant as, for example, in the case of the Webbs and\nsome of the other early Fabians, with whom enthusiasm for\nplanning was characteristically combined with the veneration\nfor the large and powerful political units and a contempt for the\nsmall state. The historian Elie Ha!t§vy, speaking of the Webbs\nwhen he first knew them forty years ago, records that\ntheir socialism was profoundly anti-liberal. They did not hate\nthe Tories, indeed they were extraordinarily lenient to them,\nbut they had no mercy for Gladstonian Liberalism. It was the\ntime of the Boer War and both the advanced liberals and the\nmen who were beginning to form the Labour Party had gen­\nerously sided with the Boers against British Imperialism, in\nthe name of freedom and humanity. But the two Webbs and\ntheir friend, Bernard Shaw, stood apart. They were ostenta­\ntiously imperialistic. The independence of small nations\nmight mean something to the liberal individualist. It meant\nnothing to collectivists like themselves. I can still hear Sidney\nWebb explaining to me that the future belonged to the great\nadministrative nations, where the officials govern and the\npolice keep order.\nAnd elsewhere Halevy quotes Bernard Shaw arguing, about the\nsame time, that \"the world is to the big and powerful states by\n1 Findlay MacKenzie (ed.), Planned Society, Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow: A Symposium,\n1937, p. xx.\n\f\n148 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nnecessity; and the little ones must come within their border or\nbe crushed out of existence\".\n1\nI have quoted at length these passages, which would not sur­\nprise one in a description of the German ancestors of national\nsocialism, because they provide so characteristic an example of\nthat glorification of power which easily leads from socialism to\nnationalism and which profoundly affects the ethical views of all\ncollectivists. So far as the rights of small nations are concerned,\nMarx and Engels were little better than most other consistent col­\nlectivists, and the views they occasionally expressed about Czechs\nor Poles resemble those of contemporary National Socialists.2\n* * * * *\nWhile to the great individualist social philosophers of the nine­\nteenth century, to a Lord Acton or Jacob Burckhardt, down to\ncontemporary socialists, like Bertrand Russell, who have\ninherited the liberal tradition, power itself has always appeared\nthe arch -evil, to the strict collectivist it is a goal in itself. It is not\nonly, as Russell has so well described, that the desire to organise\nsocial life according to a unitary plan itself springs largely from a\ndesire for power. 3 It is even more the outcome of the fact that in\norder to achieve their end collectivists must create power­\npower over men wielded by other men-of a magnitude never\nbefore known, and that their success will depend on the extent\nto which they achieve such power.\nThis remains true even though many liberal socialists are\nguided in their endeavours by the tragic illusion that by depriv­\ning private individuals of the power they possess in an indi­\nvidualist system, and by transferring this power to society, they\nI E. Halevy, L'Ere des Tyrannies, Paris, 1938, p. 2 17, and History of the English People,\nEpilogue, vol. I, pp. 105-6.\n2 Cf. K.

What all those who argue in this\nmanner overlook is that by concentrating power so that it can be\nused in the service of a single plan, it is not merely transferred\nbut infinitely heightened; that by uniting in the hands of some\nsingle body power formerly exercised independently by many,\nan amount of power is created infinitely greater than any that\nexisted before, so much more far-reaching as almost to be dif­\nferent in kind. It is entirely fallacious when it is sometimes\nargued that the great power exercised by a Central Planning\nBoard would be \"no greater than the power collectively exer­\ncised by private boards of directors\".1 There is, in a competitive\nsociety, nobody who can exercise even a fraction of the power\nwhich a socialist planning board would possess, and if nobody\ncan consciously use the power, it is just an abuse of words to\nassert that it rests with all the capitalists put together. 2 It is merely\na play upon words to speak of the \"power collectively exercised\nby private boards of directors\" so long as they do not combine\nto concerted action-which would, of course, mean the end of\ncompetition and the creation of a planned economy. To split or\ndecentralise power is necessarily to reduce the absolute amount\nof power and the competitive system is the only system designed\nto minimise by decentralisation the power exercised by man\nover man.\nWe have seen before how the separation of economic and\npolitical aims is an essential guarantee of individual freedom and\nI B. E. Lippincott, in his Introduction to O. Lange and F. M. Taylor,On the Economic\nTheory of Socialism,Minneapolis, 1938, p. 33.\n2 We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the fact that the word power,\napart from the sense in which it is used with respect to human beings, is also\nused in an impersonal (or rather anthropomorphic) sense for any determining\ncause. Of course there will always be something that determines everything\nthat happens, and in this sense the amount of power existing must always be\nthe same. But this is not true of the power consciously wielded by human\nbeings.\n\f\n150 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nhow it is consequently attacked by all collectivists. To this we\nmust now add that the \"substitution of political for economic\npower\" now so often demanded means necessarily the substitu­\ntion of power from which there is no escape for a power which\nis always limited. What is called economic power, while it can be\nan instrument of coercion, is in the hands of private individuals\nnever exclusive or complete power, never power over the whole\nlife of a person. But centralised as an instrument of political\npower it creates a degree of dependence scarcely distinguishable\nfrom slavery.\n* * * * *\nFrom the two central features of every collectivist system, the\nneed for a commonly accepted system of ends of the group, and\nthe all-overriding desire to give to the group the maximum of\npower to achieve these ends, grows a definite system of morals,\nwhich on some points coincides and on others violently con­\ntrasts with ours-but differs from it in one point which makes it\ndoubtful whether we can call it morals: that it does not leave the\nindividual conscience free to apply its own rules and does not\neven know any general rules which the individual is required or\nallowed to observe in all circumstances. This makes collectivist\nmorals so different from what we have known as morals that we\nfind it difficult to discover any principle in them, which they\nnevertheless possess.\nThe difference of principle is very much the same as that\nwhich we have already considered in connection with the Rule\nof Law. Like formal law the rules of individualist ethics, however\nunprecise they may be in many respects, are general and abso­\nlute; they prescribe or prohibit a general type of action irrespect­\nive of whether in the particular instance the ultimate purpose is\ngood or bad. To cheat or steal, to torture or betray a confidence,\nis held to be bad, irrespective of whether or not in the particular\ninstance any harm follows from it. Neither the fact that in a given\n\f\nWHY TH E WORST GET ON TOP 151\ninstance nobody may be the worse for it, nor any high purpose\nfor which such an act may have been committed, can alter the\nfact that it is bad. Though we may sometimes be forced to\nchoose between different evils they remain evils. The principle\nthat the end justifies the means is in individualist ethics regarded\nas the denial of all morals. In collectivist ethics it becomes neces­\nsarily the supreme rule; there is literally nothing which the con­\nsistent collectivist must not be prepared to do if it serves \"the\ngood of the whole\", because the\" good of the whole\" is to him\nthe only criterion of what ought to be done. The raison d'etat, in\nwhich collectivist ethics has found its most explicit formulation,\nknows no other limit than that set by expediency-the suit­\nability of the particular act for the end in view. And what the\nraison d'etat affirms with respect to the relations between different\ncountries applies equally to the relations between different indi­\nviduals within the collectivist state. There can be no limit to\nwhat its citizen must not be prepared to do, no act which his\nconscience must prevent him from committing, if it is necessary\nfor an end which the community has set itself or which his\nsuperiors order him to achieve.\n* * * * *\nThe absence of absolute formal rules in collectivist ethics does\nnot, of course, mean that there are not some useful habits of the\nindividuals which a collectivist community will encourage, and\nothers which it will discourage. Quite the reverse; it will take a\nmuch greater interest in the individual's habits of life than an\nindividualist community. To be a useful member of a collectivist\nsociety requires very definite qualities which must be strength­\nened by constant practice. The reason why we designate these\nqualities as \"useful habits\" and can hardly describe them as\nmoral virtues is that the individual could never be allowed to put\nthese rules above any definite orders, or to let them become an\nobstacle to the achievement of any of the particular aims of his"

They only serve, as it were, to fill any gaps which\ndirect orders or the designation of particular aims may leave, but\nthey can never justify a conflict with the will of the authority.\nThe differences between the virtues which will continue to be\nesteemed under a collectivist system and those which will dis­\nappear is well illustrated by a comparison of the virtues which\neven their worst enemies admit the Germans, or rather the\n\"typical Prussian\", to possess, and those of which they are com­\nmonly thought lacking and in which the English people, with\nsome justification, used to pride themselves as excelling. Few\npeople will deny that the Germans on the whole are industrious\nand disciplined, thorough and energetic to the degree of ruth­\nlessness, conscientious and single-minded in any tasks they\nundertake, that they possess a strong sense of order, duty, and\nstrict obedience to authority, and that they often show great\nreadiness to make personal sacrifices and great courage in phy­\nsical danger. All these make the German an efficient instrument\nin carrying out an assigned task, and they have accordingly been\ncarefully nurtured in the old Prussian state and the new Prussian­\ndominated Reich. What the \"typical German\" is often thought\nto lack are the individualist virtues of tolerance and respect for\nother individuals and their opinions, of independence of mind\nand that uprightness of character and readiness to defend one's\nown convictions against a superior which the Germans them­\nselves, usually conscious that they lack it, call Zivi1courage,of con­\nsideration for the weak and infirm, and of that healthy contempt\nand dislike of power which only an old tradition of personal\nliberty creates. Deficient they seem also in most of those little yet\nso important qualities which facilitate the intercourse between\nmen in a free society: kindliness and a sense of humour, personal\nmodesty, and respect for the privacy and belief in the good\nintentions of one's neighbour.\nAfter what we have already said it will not cause surprise that\nthese individualist virtues are at the same time eminently social\n\f\nWHYTHEWORSTGETONTOP 153\nvirtues, virtues which smooth social contacts and which make\n.control from above less necessary and at the same time more\ndifficult. They are virtues which flourish wherever the indi­\nvidualist or commercial type of society has prevailed and which\nare missing according as the collectivist or military type of soci­\nety predominates-a difference which is, or was, as noticeable\nbetween the various regions of Germany as it has now become\nof the views which rule in Germany and those characteristic of\nthe West. Till recently, at least, in those parts of Germany which\nhave been longest exposed to the civilising forces of commerce,\nthe old commercial towns of the south and west and the Hanse\ntowns, the general moral concepts were probably much more\nakin to those of the Western people than to those which have\nnow become dominant all over Germany.\nIt would, however, be highly unjust to regard the masses of\nthe totalitarian people as devoid of moral fervor because they\ngive unstinted support to a system which to us seems a denial of\nmost moral values. For the great majority of them the opposite is\nprobably true: the intensity of the moral emotions behind a\nmovement like that of National-Socialism or communism can\nprobably be compared only to those of the great religious\nmovements of history. Once you admit that the individual is\nmerely a means to serve the ends of the higher entity called\nsociety or the nation, most of those features of totalitarian\nregimes which horrify us follow of necessity. From the collectiv­\nist standpoint intolerance and brutal suppression of dissent, the\ncomplete disregard of the life and happiness of the individual,\nare essential and unavoidable consequences of this basic premise,\nand the collectivist can admit this and at the same time claim\nthat his system is superior to one in which the \"selfish\" interests\nof the individual are allowed to obstruct the full realisation of\nthe ends the community pursues. When German philosophers\nagain and again represent the striving for personal happiness as\nitself immoral and only the fulfilment of an imposed duty as\n\f\n154 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\npraiseworthy, they are perfectly sincere, however difficult this\nmay be to understand for those who have been brought up in a\ndifferent tradition.\nWhere there is one common all-overriding end there is no\nroom for any general morals or rules. To a limited extent we\nourselves experience this in wartime. But even war and the\ngreatest peril had led in this country only to a very moderate\napproach to totalitarianism, very little setting aside of all other\nvalues in the service of a single purpose. But where a few specific\nends dominate the whole of society, it is inevitable that\noccasionally cruelty may become a duty, that acts which revolt\nall our feeling, such as the shooting of hostages or the killing of\nthe old or sick, should be treated as mere matters of expediency,\nthat the compulsory uprooting and transportation of hundreds\nof thousands should become an instrument of policy approved\nby almost everybody except the victims, or that suggestions like\nthat ofa \"conscription of woman for breeding purposes\" can be\nseriously contemplated. There is always in the eyes of the col­\nlectivist a greater goal which these acts serve and which to him\njustifies them because the pursuit of the common end of society\ncan know no limits in any rights or values of any individual.\nBut while for the mass of the citizens of the totalitarian state it\nis often unselfish devotion to an ideal, although one that is repel­\nlent to us, which makes them approve and even perform such\ndeeds, this cannot be pleaded for those who guide its policy. To\nbe a useful assistant in the running of a totalitarian state it is not\nenough that a man should be prepared to accept specious justifi­\ncation of vile deeds, he must himself be prepared actively to\nbreak every moral rule he has ever known if this seems necessary\nto achieve the end set for him. Since it is the supreme leader who\nalone determines the ends, his instruments must have no moral\nconvictions of their own. They must, above all, be unreservedly\ncommitted to the person of the leader; but next to this the most\nimportant thing is that they should be completely unprincipled"

There will be\njobs to be done about the badness of which taken by themselves\nnobody has any doubt, but which have to be done in the service\nof some higher end, and which have to be executed with the\nsame expertness and efficiency as any others.

Neither the Gestapo\nnor the administration of a concentration camp, neither the Min­\nistry of Propaganda nor the SA or SS (or their Italian or Russian\ncounterparts) are suitable places for the exercise of humanitarian\nfeelings.

The problem\nof the selection of the leaders is closely bound up with the wide\nproblem of selection according to the opinions held, or rather\naccording to the readiness with which a person conforms to an\never-changing set of doctrines. And this leads us to one of the\nmost characteristic moral features of totalitarianism, its relation\nto, and its effect on, all the virtues falling under the general\nheading of truthfulness.

    "raw_text": "158 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nThis is, of course, brought about by the various forms of\npropaganda. Its technique is now so familiar that we need say\nlittle about it. The only point that needs to be stressed is that\nneither propaganda in itself, nor the techniques employed, are\npeculiar to totalitarianism, and that what so completely changes\nits nature and effect in a totalitarian state is that all propaganda\nserves the same goal, that all the instruments of propaganda are\nco-ordinated to influence the individuals in the same direction\nand to produce the characteristic Gleichschaltungof all minds. As a\nresult, the effect of propaganda in totalitarian countries is differ­\nent not only in magnitude but in kind from that of the propa­\nganda made for different ends by independent and competing\nagencies. If all the sources of current information are effectively\nunder one single control, it is no longer a question of merely\npersuading the people of this or that. The skilful propagandist\nthen has power to mould their minds in any direction he\nchooses and even the most intelligent and independent people\ncannot entirely escape that influence if they are long isolated\nfrom all other sources of information.\nWhile in the totalitarian states this status of propaganda gives\nit a unique power over the minds of the people, the peculiar\nmoral effects arise not from the technique but from the object\nand scope of totalitarian propaganda. If it could be confined to\nindoctrinating the people with the whole system of values\ntowards which the social effort is directed, propaganda would\nrepresent merely a particular manifestation of the characteristic\nfeatures of collectivist morals which we have already considered.\nIf its object were merely to teach the people a definite and com­\nprehensive moral code, the problem would be solely whether\nthis moral code is good or bad. We have seen that the moral code\nof a totalitarian society is not likely to appeal to us, that even the\nstriving for equality by means of a directed economy can only\nresult in an officially enforced inequality-an authoritarian\ndetermination of the status of each individual in the new\n\f\nTHEENDOFTRUTH 159\nhierarchical order; that most of the humanitarian elements of\nour morals, the respect for human life, for the weak and for the\nindividual generally, will disappear. However repellent this may\nbe to most people, and though it involves a change in moral\nstandards, it is not necessarily entirely anti-moral. Some features\nof such a system may even appeal to the sternest moralists of\na conservative tint and seem to them preferable to the softer\nstandards of a liberal society.\nThe moral consequences of totalitarian propaganda which we\nmust now consider are, however, of an even more profound\nkind. They are destructive of all morals because they undermine\none of the foundations of all morals, the sense of and the respect\nfor truth. From the nature of its task, totalitarian propaganda\ncannot confine itself to values, to questions of opinion and\nmoral convictions in which the individual always will conform\nmore or less to the views ruling his community, but must extend\nto questions of fact where human intelligence is involved in a\ndifferent way. This is so, firstly, because in order to induce\npeople to accept the official values, these must be justified, or\nshown to be connected with the values already held by the\npeople, which usually will involve assertions about causal con­\nnections between means and ends; and, secondly, because the\ndistinction between ends and means, between the goal aimed at\nand the measures taken to achieve it, is in fact never so clear-cut\nand definite as any general discussion of these problems is apt to\nsuggest; and because, therefore, people must be brought to agree\nnot only with the ultimate aims but also with the views about\nthe facts and possibilities on which the particular measures are\nbased.\n* * * * *\nWe have seen that agreement on that complete ethical code, that\nall-comprehensive system of values which is implicit in an eco­\nnomic plan, does not exist in a free society but would have to be\n\f\n160 THE R0 A D TO S E R FDO M\ncreated. But we must not assume that the planner will approach\nhis task aware of that need, or that, even if he were aware of it, it\nwould be possible to create such a comprehensive code in\nadvance. He only finds out about the conflicts between different\nneeds as he goes along, and has to make his decisions as the\nnecessity arises. The code of values guiding his decisions does\nnot exist in abstractobefore the decisions have to be made, it has to\nbe created with the particular decisions. We have also seen how\nthis inability to separate the general problem of values from the\nparticular decisions makes it impossible that a democratic body,\nwhile unable to decide the technical details of a plan, should yet\ndetermine the values guiding it.\nAnd while the planning authority will constantly have to\ndecide issues on merits about which there exist no definite\nmoral rules, it will have to justify its decisions to the people-or,\nat least, have somehow to make the people believe that they are\nthe right decisions. Although those responsible for a decision\nmay have been guided by no more than prejudice, some guiding\nprinciple will have to be stated publicly if the community is not\nmerely passively to submit but actively to support the measure.\nThe need to rationalise the likes and dislikes which, for lack of\nanything else, must guide the planner in many of his decisions,\nand the necessity of stating his reasons in a form in which they\nwill appeal to as many people as possible, will force him to\nconstruct theories, Le. assertions about the connections between\nfacts, which then become an integral part of the governing doc­\ntrine. This process of creating a \"myth\" to justify his action need\nnot be conscious. The totalitarian leader may be guided merely\nby an instinctive dislike of the state of things he has found and a\ndesire to create a new hierarchical order which conforms better\nto his conception of merit, he may merely know that he dislikes\nthe Jews who seemed to be so successful in an order which did\nnot provide a satisfactory place for him, and that he loves and\nadmires the tall blond man, the \"aristocratic\" figure of the\n\f\nTHEENDOFTRUTH 161\nnovels of his youth. So he will readily embrace theories which\nseem to provide a rational justification for the prejudices which\nhe shares with many of his fellows. Thus a pseudo-scientific\ntheory becomes part of the official creed which to a greater or\nlesser degree directs everybody's action. Or the widespread dis­\nlike of the industrial civilisation and a romantic yearning for\ncountry life, together with a (probably erroneous) idea about\nthe special value of country people as soldiers, provides the basis\nfor another myth: Blut und Boden (blood and soil), expresses not\nmerely ultimate values but a whole host of beliefs about cause\nand effect which once they have become ideals directing the\nactivity of the whole community must not be questioned.\nThe need for such official doctrines as an instrument of\ndirecting and rallying the efforts of the people has been clearly\nforeseen by the various theoreticians of the totalitarian system.\nPlato's \"noble lies\" and Sorel's \"myths\" serve the same purpose\nas the racial doctrine of the Nazis or the theory of the corpora­\ntive state of Mussolini. They are all necessarily based on particu­\n1ar views about facts which are then elaborated into scientific\ntheories in order to justify a preconceived opinion.\n* * * * *\nThe most effective way of making people accept the validity of\nthe values they are to serve is to persuade them that they are\nreally the same as those which they, or at least the best among\nthem, have always held, but which were not properly under­\nstood or recognised before. The people are made to transfer their\nallegiance from the old gods to the new under the pretence that\nthe new gods really are what their sound instinct had always\ntold them but what before they had only dimly seen. And the\nmost efficient technique to this end is to use the old words but\nchange their meaning.

Like their freedom the\n\"collective freedom\" he offers us is not the freedom of the\nmembers of society but the unlimited freedom of the planner to\ndo with society what he pleases.3 It is the confusion of freedom\nwith power carried to the extreme.\nIn this particular case the perversion of the meaning of the\nword has, of course, been well prepared by a long line of Ger­\nman philosophers, and not least by many of the theoreticians of\nsocialism. But freedom or liberty are by no means the only\n1 This is the title of a recent work by the American historian C. L. Becker.\n2 Man and Societyin an Age of Reconstruction,p. 377.\n3 Mr. Peter Drucker (The End of Economic Man, p. 74) correctly observes that \"the\nless freedom there is, the more there is talk of the 'new freedom'. Yet this new\nfreedom is a mere word which covers the exact contradiction of all that Europe\never understood by freedom .... The new freedom which is preached in\nEurope is, however, the right of the majority against the individual.\"\n\f\nTH E EN D OF TRUTH 163\nwords whose meaning has been changed into their opposites to\nmake them serve as instruments of totalitarian propaganda. We\nhave already seen how the same happens to justice and law, right\nand equality. The list could be extended till it includes almost all\nmoral and political terms in general use.\nIf one has not oneself experienced this process, it is difficult to\nappreciate the magnitude of this change of the meaning of\nwords, the confusion which it causes, and the barriers to any\nrational discussion which it creates. It has to be seen to be under­\nstood how, if one of two brothers embraces the new faith, after a\nshort while he appears to speak a different language which\nmakes any real communication between them impossible. And\nthe confusion becomes worse because this change of meaning of\nthe words describing political ideals is not a single event but a\ncontinuous process, a technique employed consciously or\nunconsciously to direct the people. Gradually, as this process\ncontinues, the whole language becomes despoiled, words be­\ncome empty shells deprived of any definite meaning, as capable\nof denoting one thing as its opposite and used solely for the\nemotional associations which still adhere to them.\n* * * * *\nIt is not difficult to deprive the great majority of independent\nthought. But the minority who will retain an inclination to criti­\ncise must also be silenced. We have already seen why coercion\ncannot be confined to the acceptance of the ethical code under­\nlying the plan according to which all social activity is directed.\nSince many parts of this code will never be explicitly stated, since\nmany parts of the guiding scale of values will exist only impli­\ncitly in the plan, the plan itself in every detail, in fact every act of\nthe government, must become sacrosanct and exempt from\ncriticism. If the people are to support the common effort with­\nout hesitation, they must be convinced that not only the end\naimed at but also the means chosen are the right ones. The\n\f\n164 THE R0 AD TO S ERF DO M\nofficial creed, to which adherence must be enforced, will there­\nfore comprise all the views about facts on which the plan is\nbased. Public criticism or even expressions of doubt must be\nsuppressed because they tend to weaken public support. As the\nWebbs report of the position in every Russian enterprise:\n\"Whilst the work is in progress, any public expression of doubt,\nor even fear that the plan will not be successful, is an act of\ndisloyalty and even of treachery because of its possible effects on\nthe will and on the efforts of the rest of the staff.\" 1 When the\ndoubt or fear expressed concerns not the success of a particular\nenterprise but of the whole social plan, it must even more be\ntreated as sabotage.\nFacts and theories must thus become no less the object of an\nofficial doctrine than views about values. And the whole appara­\ntus for spreading knowledge, the schools and the press, wireless\nand cinema, will be used exclusively to spread those views\nwhich, whether true or false, will strengthen the belief in the\nrightness of the decisions taken by the authority; and all infor­\nmation that might cause doubt or hesitation will be withheld.\nThe probable effect on the people's loyalty to the system\nbecomes the only criterion for deciding whether a particular\npiece of information is to be published or suppressed. The situ­\nation in a totalitarian state is permanently and in all fields the\nsame that it is elsewhere in some fields in wartime. Everything\nwhich might cause doubt about the wisdom of the government\nor create discontent will be kept from the people. The basis\nof unfavourable comparisons with conditions elsewhere, the\nknowledge of possible alternatives to the course actually taken,\ninformation which might suggest ~ailure on the part of the\ngovernment to live up to its promises or to take advantage of\nopportunities to improve conditions, will all be suppressed.\nThere is consequently no field where the systematic control of\n1 S. and B. Webb, Soviet Communism,p. 1038.\n\f\nTHEENDOFTRUTH 165\ninformation will not be practised and uniformity of views not\nenforced.\nThis applies even to fields apparently most remote from any\npolitical interests, and particularly to all the sciences, even the\nmost abstract. That in the disciplines dealing directly with\nhuman affairs and therefore most immediately affecting political\nviews, such as history, law, or economics, the disinterested\nsearch for truth cannot be allowed in a totalitarian system, and\nthe vindication of the official views becomes the sole object, is\neasily seen and has been amply confirmed by experience. These\ndisciplines have indeed in all totalitarian countries become the\nmost fertile factories of the official myths which the rulers use to\nguide the minds and wills of their subjects. It is not surprising\nthat in these spheres even the pretence that they search for truth\nis abandoned and that the authorities decide what doctrines\nought to be taught and published.\nTotalitarian control of opinion extends, however, also to sub­\njects which at first seem to have no political significance. Some­\ntimes it is difficult to explain why particular doctrines should be\nofficially proscribed or why others should be encouraged, and it\nis curious that these likes and dislikes are apparently somewhat\nsimilar in the different totalitarian systems. In particular, they all\nseem to have in common an intense dislike of the more abstract\nforms of thought-a dislike characteristically also shown by\nmany of the collectivists among our scientists. Whether the\ntheory of relativity is represented as a \"semitic attack on the foun­\ndation of Christian and Nordic physics\" or opposed because it\nis \"in conflict with dialectical materialism and Marxist dogma\"\ncomes very much to the same thing. Nor does it make much\ndifference whether certain theorems of mathematical statistics\nare attacked because they \"form part of the class struggle on the\nideological frontier and are a product of the historical role of\nmathematics as the servant of the bourgeoisie\", or whether the\nwhole subject is condemned because \"it provides no guarantee\n\f\n166 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthat it will serve the interest of the people\". It seems that pure\nmathematics is no less a victim and that even the holding of\nparticular views about the nature of continuity can be ascribed\nto \"bourgeois prejudices\". According to the Webbs the Journal for\nMarxist-LeninistNaturalScienceshas the following slogans: \"We stand\nfor Party in Mathematics. We stand for the purity of Marxist­\nLeninist theory in surgery.\" The situation seems to be very\nsimilar in Germany. The Journal of the National-SocialistAssociationof\nMathematiciansis full of \"party in mathematics\", and one of the\nbest known German physicists, the Nobel prizeman Lennard,\nhas summed up his life work under the title German Physics in Four\nVolumes!\nIt is entirely in keeping with the whole spirit of totalitarian­\nism that it condemns any human activity done for its own sake\nand without ulterior purpose. Science for science' sake, art for\nart's sake, are equally abhorrent to the Nazis, our socialist\nintellectuals, and the communists. Every activity must derive its\njustification from a conscious social purpose. There must be no\nspontaneous, unguided activity, because it might produce\nresults which cannot be foreseen and for which the plan does\nnot provide. It might produce something new, undreamt of in\nthe philosophy of the planner. The principle extends even to\ngames and amusements. I leave it to the reader to guess whether\nit was in Germany or in Russia where chess-players were\noffiCiallyexhorted that \"we must finish once and for all with the\nneutrality of chess. We must condemn once and for all the for­\nmula 'chess for the sake of chess' like the formula 'art for art's\nsake' \".\nIncredible as some of these aberrations may appear, we must\nyet be on our guard not to dismiss them as mere accidental by­\nproducts which have nothing to do with the essential character\nof a planned or totalitarian system. They are not. They are a\ndirect result of that same desire to see everything directed by a\n\"unitary conception of the whole\", of the need to uphold at all\n\f\nTHEENDOFTRUTH 167\ncosts the views in the service of which people are asked to make\nconstant sacrifices, and of the general idea that the knowledge\nand beliefs of the people are an instrument to be used for a\nsingle purpose. Once science has to serve, not truth, but the\ninterests of a class, a community, or a state, the sole task of\nargument and discussion is to vindicate and to spread still fur­\nther the beliefs by which the whole life of the community is\ndirected. As the Nazi Minister of Justice has explained, the ques­\ntion which every new scientific theory must ask itself is: \"Do I\nserve National-Socialism for the greatest benefit of all?\"\nThe word truth itself ceases to have its old meaning. It\ndescribes no longer something to be found, with the individual\nconscience as the sole arbiter of whether in any particular\ninstance the evidence (or the standing of those proclaiming it)\nwarrants a belief; it becomes something to be laid down by\nauthority, something which has to be believed in the interest of\nthe unity of the organised effort, and which may have to be\naltered as the exigencies of this organised effort require it.\nThe general intellectual climate which this produces, the\nspirit of complete cynicism as regards truth which it engenders,\nthe loss of the sense of even the meaning of truth, the disappear­\nance of the spirit of independent inquiry and of the belief in the\npower of rational conviction, the way in which differences of\nopinion in every branch of knowledge become political issues to\nbe decided by authority, are all things which one must person­\nally experience-no short description can convey their extent.\nPerhaps the most alarming fact is that contempt for intellectual\nliberty is not a thing which arises only once the totalitarian\nsystem is established, but one which can be found everywhere\namong intellectuals who have embraced a collectivist faith and\nwho are acclaimed as intellectual leaders even in countries still\nunder a liberal regime.

Have we not recently seen a British\nscientific writer defend even Inquisition because in his opinion\nit \"is beneficial to science when it protects a rising class\"?l This\nview is, of course, practically indistinguishable from the views\nwhich led the Nazis to the persecution of men of science, the\nburning of scientific books, and the systematic eradication of the\nintelligentsia of the subjected people.\n* * * * *\nThe desire to force upon the people a creed which is regarded as\nsalutary for them is, of course, not a thing that is new or peculiar\nto our time. New, however, is the argument by which many of\nour intellectuals try to justify such attempts. There is no real\nfreedom of thought in our society, so it is said, because the\nopinions and tastes of the masses are shaped by propaganda, by\nadvertising, by the example of the upper classes, and by other\nenvironmental factors which inevitably force the thinking of the\npeople into well-worn grooves. From this it is concluded that if\nthe ideals and tastes of the great majority are always fashioned by\ncircumstances which we can control, we ought to use this power\ndeliberately to turn the thoughts of the people in what we think\nis a desirable direction.\nProbably it is true enough that the great majority are rarely\ncapable of thinking independently, that on most questions they\naccept views which they find ready-made, and that they will be\nequally content if born or coaxed into one set of beliefs or\nanother. In any society freedom of thought will probably be of\ndirect significance only for a small minority. But this does not\nmean that anyone is competent, or ought to have power, to select\nthose to whom this freedom is to be reserved. It certainly does\nnot justify the presumption of any group of people to claim the\nI ]. G. Crowther, The Social Relationof Science, 1941 , p. 333.\n\f\nTHEENDOFTRUTH 169\nright to determine what people ought to think or believe. It\nshows a complete confusion of thought to suggest that, because\nunder any sort of system the majority of people follow the lead\nof somebody, it makes no difference if everybody has to follow\nthe same lead. To deprecate the value of intellectual freedom\nbecause it will never mean for everybody the same possibility of\nindependent thought is completely to miss the reasons which\ngive intellectual freedom its value. What is essential to make it\nserve its function as the prime mover of intellectual progress is\nnot that everybody may be able to think or write anything, but\nthat any cause or idea may be argued by somebody. So long as\ndissent is not suppressed, there will always be some who will\nquery the ideas ruling their contemporaries and put new ideas\nto the test of argument and propaganda.\nThis interaction of individuals, possessing different know­\nledge and different views, is what constitutes the life of thought.\nThe growth of reason is a social process based on the existence\nof such differences. It is of its essence that its results cannot be\npredicted, that we cannot know which views will assist this\ngrowth and which will not-in short, that this growth cannot be\ngoverned by any views which we now possess without at the\nsame time limiting it. To \"plan\" or \"organise\" the growth of\nmind, or, for that matter, progress in general, is a contradiction\nin terms. The idea that the human mind ought \"consciously\" to\ncontrol its own development confuses individual reason, which\nalone can \"consciously control\" anything, with the inter­\npersonal process to which its growth is due. By attempting to\ncontrol it we are merely setting bounds to its development and\nmust sooner or later produce a stagnation of thought and a\ndecline of reason.\nThe tragedy of collectivist thought is that while it starts out to\nmake reason supreme, it ends by destroying reason because it\nmisconceives the process on which the growth of reason\ndepends.

Individualism is thus an attitude of\nhumility before this social process and of tolerance to other\nopinions, and is the exact opposite of that intellectual hubris\nwhich is at the root of the demand for comprehensive direction\nof the social process.\n\f\n12\nTH E SOCIALIST ROOTS\nOF NAZISM\nAll anti-liberal forces are combining against everything that is\nliberal.\nA. Moellervan den Bruck.\nIt is a common mistake to regard National-Socialism as a mere\nrevolt against reason, an irrational movement without intel­\nlectual background. If that were so, the movement would be\nmuch less dangerous than it is. But nothing could be further\nfrom the truth or more misleading. The doctrines of National­\nSocialism are the culmination of a long evolution of thought, a\nprocess in which thinkers who have had great influence far\nbeyond the confines of Germany have taken part. Whatever one\nmay think of the premises from which they started, it cannot be\ndenied that the men who produced the new doctrines were\npowerful writers who left the impress of their ideas on the\nwhole of European thought. Their system was developed with\nruthless consistency. Once one accepts the premises from which\n\f\n172 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nit starts, there is no escape from its logic. It is simply collectivism\nfreed from all traces of an individualist tradition which might\nhamper its realisation.\nThough in this development German thinkers have taken the\nlead, they were by no means alone. Thomas Carlyle and Houston\nStewart Chamberlain, Auguste Comte and Georges Sorel are as\nmuch a part of that continuous development as any Germans.\nThe development of this strand of thought within Germany has\nbeen well traced recently by Mr. R. D. Butler in his study of The\nRoots of National Socialism. But although its persistence there\nthrough a hundred and fifty years in almost unchanged and\never-recurring form, which emerges from that study, is rather\nfrightening, it is easy to exaggerate the importance these ideas\nhad in Germany before 1914. They were only one strand of\nthought among a people then perhaps more varied in its views\nthan any other. And they were on the whole represented by a\nsmall minority and held in as great contempt by the majority of\nGermans as they were in other countries.\nWhat, then, caused these views held by a reactionary minority\nfinally to gain the support of the great majority of Germans and\npractically the whole of her youth? It was not merely the defeat,\nthe suffering, and the wave of nationalism which led to their\nsuccess. Still less was the cause, as so many people wish to\nbelieve, a capitalist reaction against the advance of socialism. On\nthe contrary, the support which brought these ideas to power\ncame precisely from the socialist camp. It was certainly not\nthrough the bourgeoisie, but rather the absence of a strong\nbourgeoisie, by which they were helped to power.\nThe doctrines which had guided the ruling elements in Ger­\nmany for the past generation were not opposed to the socialism\nin Marxism, but to the liberal elements contained in it, its inter­\nnationalism and its democracy. And as it became increasingly\nclear that it was just these elements which formed obstacles to\nthe realisation of socialism, the socialists of the left approached\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 173\nmore and more to those of the right. It was the union of the\nanti -capitalist forces of the right and the left, the fusion of radical\nand conservative socialism, which drove out from Germany\neverything that was liberal.\nThe connection between socialism and nationalism in Ger­\nmany was close from the beginning. It is significant that the most\nimportant ancestors of National~Socialism-Fichte, Rodbertus,\nand Lassall-are at the same time acknowledged fathers of social­\nism. While theoretical socialism in its Marxist form was directing\nthe German labour movement, the authoritarian and nationalist\nelement receded for a time into the background. But not for\nlong.\n1\nFrom 1914 onwards there arose from the ranks of Marxist\nsocialism one teacher after another who led, not the conserva­\ntives and reactionaries, but the hardworking labourer and idealist\nyouth into the national-socialist fold. It was only thereafter that\nthe tide of nationalist socialism attained major importance and\nrapidly grew into the Hitlerian doctrine. The war hysteria of\n1914, which, just because of the German defeat, was never fully\ncured, is the beginning of the modern development which pro­\nduced National-Socialism, and it was largely with the assistance\nof old socialists that it rose during this period.\n* * * * *\nPerhaps the first, and in some ways the most characteristic,\nrepresentative of this development is the late Professor Werner\nSombart, whose notorious Handler und Helden (Merchants and\nHeroes) appeared in 1915. Sombart had begun as a Marxian\nsocialist, and as late as 1909 could assert with pride that he had\ndevoted the greater part of his life to fighting for the ideas of Karl\nI And only partially. In 1892 one of the leaders of the social-democratic party,\nAugust Bebel, was able to tell Bismarck that \"the Imperial Chancellor can rest\nassured that German Social Democracy is a sort of preparatory school for\nmili tarism\" !\n\f\n174 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nMarx. He had done as much as any man to spread socialist ideas\nand anti -capitalist resentment of varying shades throughout\nGermany; and if German thought became penetrated with Marx­\nian elements in a way that was true of no other country till the\nRussian revolution, this was in a large measure due to Sombart.\nAt one time he was regarded as the outstanding representative of\nthe persecuted socialist intelligentsia, unable, because of his\nradical views, to obtain a University chair. And even after the last\nwar the influence, inside and outside Germany of his work as a\nhistorian, which remained Marxist in approach after he had\nceased to be a Marxist in politics, was most extensive and is\nparticularly noticeable in the works of many of the English and\nAmerican planners.\nIn his war book this old socialist welcomed the \"German\nWar\" as the inevitable conflict between the commercial civilisa­\ntion of England and the heroic culture of Germany. His con­\ntempt for the \"commercial\" views of the English people, who\nhad lost all warlike instincts, is unlimited. Nothing is more\ncontemptible in his eyes than the universal striving after the\nhappiness of the individual; and what he describes as the leading\nmaxim of English morals: be just \"that it may be well with thee\nand that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land\" is to him\n\"the most infamous maxim which has ever been pronounced by\na commercial mind\". The \"German idea of the state\" as formu­\nlated by Fichte, Lassalle,and Rodbertus, is that the state is neither\nfounded nor formed by individuals, nor an aggregate of indi­\nviduals, nor is its purpose to serve any interest of individuals. It\nis a Volksgemeinschaftin which the individual has no rights but only\nduties. Claims of the individual are always an outcome of the\ncommercial spirit. \"The ideas of 1789\"-Liberty, Equality\nFraternity-are characteristically commercial ideals which have\nno other purpose but to secure certain advantages to individuals.\nBefore 1914 all the true German ideals of a heroic life were\nin deadly danger before the continuous advance of English\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 175\ncommercial ideals, English comfort, and English sport. The\nEnglish people had not only themselves become completely\ncorrupted, every trade unionist being sunk in the \"morass of\ncomfort\", but they had begun to infect all other peoples. Only\nthe war had helped the Germans to remember that they were\nreally a people of warriors, a people among whom all activities\nand particularly all economic activities were subordinated to\nmilitary ends. Sombart knew that the Germans were held in\ncontempt by other people because they regard war as sacred­\nbut he glories in it. To regard war as inhuman and senseless is a\nproduct of commercial views. There is a life higher than the\nindividual life, the life of the people and the life of the state, and it\nis the purpose of the individual to sacrifice himself for that\nhigher life. War is to Sombart the consummation of the heroic\nview of life, and the war against England is the war against the\nopposite ideal, the commercial ideal of individual freedom and\nof English comfort, which in his eyes finds its most contemptible\nexpression in-the safety-razors found in the English trenches.\n* * * * *\nIf Sombart's outburst was at the time too much even for most\nGermans, another German professor arrived at essentially the\nsame ideas in a more moderate and more scholarly, but for that\nreason even more effective, form. Professor Johann Plenge was as\ngreat an authority on Marx as Sombart. His book on Marx und Hegel\nmarks the beginning of the modern Hegel-renaissance among\nMarxian scholars; and there can be no doubt about the genuinely\nsocialist nature of the convictions with which he started. Among\nhis numerous war publications the most important is a small but\nat the time widely discussed book with the significant title: 1789\nand 1914. The Symbolic Years in the History of the Political Mind. It is\ndevoted to the conflict between the \"Ideas of 1789\", the ideal of\nfreedom, and the \"Ideas of 1914\", the ideal of organisation.\nOrganisation is to him, as to all socialists who derive their\n\f\n176 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nsocialism from a crude application of scientific ideals to the prob­\nlems of society, the essence of socialism. It was, as he rightly\nemphasises, the root of the socialist movement at its inception in\nearly nineteenth-century France. Marx and Marxism have\nbetrayed this basic idea of socialism by their fanatic but utopian\nadherence to the abstract idea of freedom. Only now was the idea\nof organisation again coming into its own, elsewhere, as wit­\nnessed by the work of Mr. H. G. Wells (by whose Future in America\nProfessor Plenge was profoundly influenced, and whom he\ndescribes as one of the outstanding figures of modern socialism),\nbut particularly in Germany, where it is best understood and most\nfully realised. The war between England and Germany is therefore\nreally a conflict between two opposite principles. The \"Economic\nWorld War\" is the third great epoch of spiritual struggle in\nmodern history. It is of equal importance with the Reformation\nand the bourgeois revolution of liberty. It is the struggle for the\nvictory of the new forces born out of the advanced economic life\nof the nineteenth century: socialism and organisation.\nBecause in the sphere of ideas Germany was the most con­\nvinced exponent of all socialist dreams, and in the sphere of\nreality she was the most powerful architect of the most highly\norganised economic system.-In us is the twentieth century.\nHowever the war may end, we are the exemplary people. Our\nideas will determine the aims of the life of humanity.-World\nHistory experiences at present the colossal spectacle that with\nus a new great ideal of life penetrates to final victory, while\nat the same time in England one of the World-Historical\nprinciples finally collapses.\nThe war economy created in Germany in 19 14\nis the first realisation of a socialist society and its spirit the first\nactive, and not merely demanding, appearance of a socialist\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 177\nspirit. The needs ofthe war have established the socialist idea in\nGerman economic life, and thus the defence of our nation pro­\nduced for humanity the idea of '9'4, the idea of German organ­\nisation, the people's community (Volksgemeinschaft)of national\nsocialism .... Without our really noticing it the whole of our\npolitical life in state and industry has risen to a higher stage.\nState and economic life form a new unity.... The feeling of\neconomic responsibility which characterises the work of the\ncivil servant pervades all private activity.... The new German\ncorporative constitution of economic life [which Professor\nPlenge admits is not yet ripe or complete] is the highest form of\nlife of the state which has ever been known on earth.\nAt first Professor Plenge still hoped to reconcile the ideal of\nliberty and the ideal of organisation, although largely through\nthe complete but voluntary submission of the individual to the\nwhole. But these traces of liberal ideas soon disappear from his\nwritings. By 1918 the union between socialism and ruthless\npower politics had become complete in his mind. Shortly before\nthe end of the war he exhorted his compatriots in the socialist\njournal Die Glocke in the following manner:\nIt is high time to recognise the fact that socialism must be\npower policy, because it is to be organisation. Socialism has to\nwin power: it must never blindly destroy power. And the most\nimportant and critical question for socialism in the time of war\nof peoples is necessarily this: what people is pre-eminently\nsummoned to power, because it is the exemplary leader in the\norganisation of peoples?\nAnd he forecast all the ideas which were finally to justify\nHitler's New Order:\nJust from the point ofview ofsocialism, which is organisation,\n\f\n178 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nis not an absolute right of self-determination of the peoples the\nright of individualistic economic anarchy? Are we willing to\ngrant complete self-determination to the individual in economic\nlife? Consistent socialism can accord to the people a right to\nincorporation only in accordance with the real distribution of\nforces historically determined.\n* * * * *\nThe ideals which Plenge expressed so clearly were especially\npopular among, and perhaps even derive from, certain circles of\nGerman scientists and engineers who, precisely as is now so\nloudly demanded by their English counterparts, clamoured for\nthe centrally planned organisation of all.aspects of life. Leading\namong these was the famous chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, one of\nwhose pronouncements on this point has achieved a certain\ncelebrity. He is reported to have stated publicly that\nGermany wants to organise Europe which up to now still\nlacks organisation. I will explain to you now Germany's great\nsecret: we, or perhaps the German race, have discovered the\nsignificance of organisation. While the other nations still live\nunder the regime of individualism, we have already achieved\nthat of organisation.\nIdeas very similar to these were current in the offices of the\nGerman raw material dictator, Walter Rathenau, who, although\nhe would have shuddered had he realised the consequences of his\ntotalitarian economics, yet deserves a considerable place in any\nfuller history of the growth of Nazi ideas. Through his writings\nhe has probably, more than any other man, determined the eco­\nnomic views of the generation which grew up in Germany dur­\ning and immediately after the last war; and some of his closest\ncollaborators were later to form the backbone of the staff of Goer­\ning's Five Year Plan administration. Very similar also was much of\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 179\nthe teaching of another former Marxist, Friedrich Naumann,\nwhose Mitte1europareached probably the greatest circulation of any\nwar book in Germany.! But it was left to an active socialist politi­\ncian, a member of the left wing of the social-democratic party in\nthe Reichstag, to develop these ideas most fully and to spread\nthem far and wide. Paul Lensch had already in earlier books\ndescribed the war as \"the flight of the English bourgeoisie before\nthe advance of socialism\", and explained how different were the\nsocialist ideal of freedom and the English conception. But only in\nhis third and most successful war book, his Three Years of World\nRevolution,2 were his characteristic ideas, under the influence of\nPlenge, to achieve full development. Lensch bases his argument\non an interesting and in many respects accurate historical account\nofhow the adoption of protection by Bismarck had made possible\nin Germany a development towards that industrial concentration\nand cartellisation which, from his Marxist standpoint, repre­\nsented a higher state of industrial development.\nThe result of Bismarck's decision of the year 1879 was that\nGermany took on the role of the revolutionary; that is to say, of\na state whose position in relation to the rest of the world is that\nof a representative of a higher and more advanced economic\nsystem. Having realised this, we should perceive that in the\npresent World Revolution Germany represents the revolutionary,\nand her greatest antagonist, England, the counter-revolutionary\nside. This fact proves how little the constitution of a country,\nwhether it be liberal and republican or monarchic and auto­\ncratic, affects the question whether, from the point of view of\nI A good summary of Naumann's views, as characteristic of the German com­\nbination of Socialism and Imperialism as any we quote in the text, will be\nfound in R.

The\nEnglish translation of this work was made available, still during the last war, by\nsome far-seeing person.\n\f\n180 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nhistorical development, that country is to be regarded as liberal\nor not. Or, to put it more plainly, our conceptions of Liberalism,\nDemocracy, and so forth, are derived from the ideas of English\nIndividualism, according to which a state with a weak govern­\nment is a liberal state, and every restriction upon the freedom\nof the individual is conceived as the product of autocracy and\nmilitarism.\nIn Germany, the \"historically appointed representative\" of\nthis higher form of economic life,\nthe struggle for socialism has been extraordinarily simplified,\nsince all the prerequisite conditions of Socialism had already\nbecome established there. And hence it was necessarily a vital\nconcern of any socialist party that Germany should triumph­\nantly hold her own against her enemies, and thereby be able to\nfulfil her historic mission of revolutionising the world. Hence\nthe war of the Entente against Germany resembled the attempt\nof the lower bourgeoisie of the pre-capitalistic age to prevent\nthe decline of their own class.\nThat organisation of Capital [Lensch continues] which began\nunconsciously before the war, and which during the war has\nbeen continued consciously, will be systematically continued\nafter the war. Not through any desire for any arts of organisa­\ntion nor yet because socialism has been recognised as a higher\nprinciple of social development. The classes who are to-day the\npractical pioneers of socialism are, in theory, its avowed\nopponents, or, at any rate, were so up to a short time ago.\nSocialism is coming, and in fact has to some extent already\narrived, since we can no longer live without it.\nThe only people who still oppose this tendency are the liberals.\nThis class of people, who unconsciously reason from\nEnglish standards, comprises the whole educated German\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 181\nbourgeoisie. Their political notions of \"freedom\" and \"civic\nright\", of constitutionalism and parliamentarianism, are\nderived from that individualistic conception of the world, of\nwhich English Liberalism is a classical embodiment, and which\nwas adopted by the spokesmen of the German bourgeoisie in\nthe 'fifties, 'sixties, and 'seventies of the nineteenth century. But\nthese standards are old-fashioned and shattered, just as old­\nfashioned English Liberalism has been shattered by this war.\nWhat has to be done now is to get rid of these inherited polit­\nical ideas and to assist the growth of a new conception of State\nand Society. In this sphere also Socialism must present a con­\nscious and determined opposition to individualism. In this\nconnection it is an astonishing fact that, in the so-called\n\"reactionary\" Germany, the working classes have won for\nthemselves a much more solid and powerful position in the life\nof the state than is the case either in England or in France.\nLensch follows this up with a consideration which again\ncontains much truth and which deserves to be pondered:\nSince the Social Democrats, by the aid of this [universal] suf­\nfrage, occupied every post which they could obtain in the\nReichstag, the State Parliament, the municipal councils, the\ncourts forthe settlement oftrade disputes, the sick funds, and so\nforth, they penetrated very deeply into the organism ofthe state;\nbut the price which they had to pay for this was that the state, in\nits turn, exercised a profound influence upon the working\nclasses. To be sure, as the result of strenuous socialistic labours\nfor fifty years, the state is no longer the same as it was in the year\n1867, when universal suffrage first came into operation; but\nthen, Social Democracy, in its turn, is no longer the same as it\nwas at the ti me. The state has undergonea processofsocialisation,\nand Social Democracyhas undergonea processofnationalisation.\n* * * * *\n\f\n182 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nPlenge and Lensch in turn have provided the leading ideas for\nthe immediate masters of National-Socialism, particularly\nOswald Spengler and A. Moeller van den Bruck, to mention only\nthe two best-known names. l\nOpinions may differ in how far the\nformer can be regarded as a socialist. But that in his tract on\nPrussianismand Socialism,which appeared in 1920, he merely gave\nexpression to ideas widely held by German socialists will now be\nevident. A few specimens of his argument will suffice. \"Old\nPrussian spirit and socialist conviction, which to-day hate each\nother with the hatred of brothers, are one and the same.\" The\nrepresentatives of Western civilisation in Germany, the German\nliberals, are \"the invisible English army which after the battle\nof Jena, Napoleon left behind on German soil\". To Spengler,\nmen like Hardenberg and Humboldt and all the other liberal\nreformers were \"English\". But this \"English\" spirit will be\nturned out by the German revolution which began in 1914.\nThe three last nations of the Occident have aimed at three\nforms of existence, represented by famous watchwords: Free­\ndom, Equality, Community. They appear in the political forms\nof liberal Parliamentarianism, social Democracy, and authori­\ntarian socialism.\n2\n••• The German, more correctly, Prussian,\ninstinct is: the power belongs to the whole .... Everyone is\nI The same applies to many others of the intellectual leaders of the generation\nwhich has produced Nazism, such as Othmar Spann, Hans Freyer, Carl Schmitt,\nand Ernst Junger. On these compare the interesting study by Aurel Kolnai, The\nWar against the West, 1938, which suffers, however, from the defect that, by\nconfining itself to the post-war period when these ideals had already been\ntaken over by the nationalists, it overlooks their socialist creators.\n2 This Spenglerian formula finds its echo in an often quoted statement of Carl\nSchmitt, the leading Nazi expert on constitutional law, according to which the\nevolution of government proceeds \"in three dialectic stages : from the absolute\nstate of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the neutral state of the\nliberal nineteenth century to the totalitarianstate in which state and society are\nidentical\" (C. Schmitt, Der Hiiterder Verfassung,Tubingen, 1931, p. 79).\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 183\ngiven his place. One commands or obeys. This is, since the\neighteenth century, authoritarian socialism, essentially illiberal\nand anti-democratic, in so far as English Liberalism and French\nDemocracy are meant. ... There are in Germany many hated\nand ill-reputed contrasts, but liberalism alone is contemptible\non German soil.\nThe structure of the English nation is based on the distinc­\ntion between rich and poor, that of the Prussian on that\nbetween command and obedience. The meaning of class dis­\ntinction is accordingly fundamentally different in the two\ncountries.\nAfter pointing out the essential difference between the English\ncompetitive system and the Prussian system of \"economic\nadministration\", and after showing (consciously following\nLensch) how since Bismarck the deliberate organisation of\neconomic activity had progressively assumed more socialist\nforms, Spengler continues:\nIn Prussia there existed a real state in the most ambitious\nmeaning of the word. There could be, strictly speaking, no pri­\nvate persons. Everybody who lived within the system that\nworked with the precision of a clockwork, was in some way a\nlink in it. The conduct of public business could therefore not be\nin the hands of private people, as is supposed by Parliamen­\ntarianism. It was an Amt and the responsible politician was a\ncivil servant, a servant of the whole.\nThe \"Prussian idea\" requires that everybody should become a\nstate official, that all wages and salaries be fixed by the state. The\nadministration of all property, in particular, becomes a salaried\nfunction. The state of the future will be a Beamtenstaat.But\nthe decisive question not only for Germany, but for the world,\n\f\n184 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nwhich must be solved by Germany for the world is: Is in future\ntrade to govern the state, or the state to govern trade? In the\nface of this question Prussianism and Socialism are the same\n... Prussianism and Socialism combat the England in our\nmidst.\nIt was only a step from this for the patron-saint of National­\nSocialism Moeller van den Bruck to proclaim the World War a\nwar between liberalism and socialism: \"We have lost the war\nagainst the West. Socialism has lost it against Liberalism. U 1 As\nwith Spengler, liberalism is, therefore, the arch-enemy. Moeller\nvan den Bruck glories in the fact that\nthere are no liberals in Germany to-day; there are young revolu­\ntionaries: there are young conservatives. But who would be a\nliberal? ... Liberalism is a philosophy of life from which\nGerman youth now turns with nausea, with wrath, with quite\npeculiar scorn, for there is none more foreign, more repugnant,\nmore opposed to its philosophy. German youth to-day recognises\nthe liberal as the arch-enemy.\nMoeller van den Bruck's Third Reich was intended to give the\nGermans a socialism adapted to their nature and undefiled by\nWestern liberal ideas. And so it did.\nThese writers were by no means isolated phenomena. As early\nas 1922 a detached observer could speak of a \"peculiar and, on a\nfirst glance, surprising phenomenon\nu\nthen to be observed in\nGermany:\nThe fight againstthe capitalistic order, accordingtothis view, is\nI Moeller van den Bruck, Sozialismusund Aussenpolitik,1933, pp. 87, 90, and 100.\nThe articles here reprinted, particularly the article on \"Lenin and Keynes\"\nwhich discusses most fully the contention discussed in the text, were first\npublished between 1919 and 1923.\n\f\nTHE SOCIALIST ROOTS OF NAZISM 185\na continuation of the war against the Entente with the weapons\nof the spirit and of economic organisation, the way which leads\nto practical socialism, a return of the German people to their\nbest and noblest traditions.\n1\nFight against liberalism in all its forms, liberalism that had\ndefeated Germany, was the common idea which united socialists\nand conservatives in one common front. At first it was mainly\nin the German Youth Movement, almost entirely socialist in\ninspiration and outlook, where these ideas were most readily\naccepted and the fusion of socialism and nationalism completed.\nIn the later 'twenties and till the advent to power of Hitler a\ncircle of young men gathered round the journal Die Tat and led\nby Ferdinand Fried became the chief exponent of this tradition\nin the intellectual sphere. Fried's Ende des Kapitalismusis perhaps the\nmost characteristic product of this group of Edelnazis,as they were\nknown in Germany, and is particularly disquieting because of\nits resemblance to so much of the literature which we see in\nEngland to-day, where we can watch the same drawing together\nof the socialists of the Left and the Right, and nearly the same\ncontempt of all that is liberal in the old sense. \"Conservative\nSocialism\" (and, in other circles, \"Religious Socialism\") was the\nslogan under which a large number of writers prepared the\natmosphere in which \"National-Socialism\" succeeded. It is\n\"conservative socialism\" which is the dominant trend in this\ncountry now.

And the\nfact that the difference has steadily become greater seems to\nrefute any suggestion that we may be moving in a similar direc­\ntion. But let us not forget that fifteen years ago the possibility of\nsuch a thing happening in Germany would have appeared just as\nfantastic, not only to nine-tenths of the Germans themselves, but\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 187\nalso to the most hostile foreign observers (however wise they\nmay now pretend to have been).\nAs suggested earlier in these pages, however, it is not the\npresent Germany but the Germany of twenty or thirty years ago\nto which conditions in this country show an ever-increasing\nresemblance. There are many features which were then regarded\nas \"typically German\" and which are now equally familiar in\nthis country, and many symptoms that point to a further devel­\nopment in the same direction. We have already mentioned the\nmost significant, the increasing similarity between the economic\nviews of the Right and Left and their common opposition to the\nLiberalism that used to be the common basis of most English\npolitics. We have the authority of Mr. Harold Nicolson for the\nstatement that during the last Conservative government, among\nthe back-benchers of the Conservative party \"the most gifted ...\nwere all socialists at heart\" 1 and there can be little question that,\nas in the days of the Fabians, many socialists have more sympathy\nwith the Conservatives than with the Liberals. There are many\nother features closely related to this. The increasing veneration\nfor the state, the admiration of power, and of bigness for bigness'\nsake, the enthusiasm for \"organisation\" of everything (we now\ncall it planning), and that \"inability to leave anything to the\nsimple power of organic growth\", which even H. v. Treitschke\ndeplored in the Germans sixty years ago, are all scarcely less\nmarked in this country now than they were in Germany.\nHow far in the last twenty years England has travelled on the\nGerman path is brought home to one with extraordinary vivid­\nness if one now reads some of the more serious discussions of\nthe differences between British and German views on political\nand moral issues which appeared in this country during the last\nwar. It is probably true to say that then the British public had in\ngeneral a truer appreciation of these differences than it has now;\n1 The Spectatort April 12, 1940 t p. 523."

It is scarcely an exaggeration to\nsay that the more typically English a writer on political or social\nproblems then appeared to the world, the more is he to-day\nforgotten in his own country. Men like Lord Morley or Henry\nSidgwick, Lord Acton or A. V. Dicey, who were then admired in\nthe world at large as outstanding examples of the political wis­\ndom of liberal England, are to the present generation largely\nobsolete Victorians. Perhaps nothing shows this change more\nclearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment\nof Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of\nGladstone is rarely mentioned by the younger generation\nwithout a sneer over his Victorian morality and naive\nutopianism.\nI wish I could in a few paragraphs adequately convey the\nalarming impression gained from the perusal of a few of the\nEnglish works on the ideas dominating the Germany of the last\nwar, where almost every word could be applied to the views\nmost conspicuous in current English literature. I shall merely\nquote one brief passage by Lord Keynes, describing in 1915 the\n\"nightmare\" which he found expounded in a typical German\nwork of that period: he describes how according to a German\nauthor\neven in peace industrial life must remain mobilised. This is\nwhat he means by speaking of the \"militarisation of our indus­\ntrial life\" [the title of the work reviewed]. Individualism must\ncome to an end absolutely. A system of regulations must be set\nup, the object of which is not the greater happiness of the\nindividual (Professor Jaffe is not ashamed to say this in so\nmany words), but the strengthening of the organised unity of\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 189\nthe state for the object of attaining the maximum degree of\nefficiency (Leistungsfiihigheit),the influence of which on indi­\nvidual advantage is only indirect.- This hideous doctrine is\nenshrined in a sort of idealism. The nation will grow into a\n\"closed unity\" and will become, in fact, what Plato declared it\nshould be-\"Der Mensch im Grossen\". In particular, the com­\ning peace will bring with it a strengthening of the idea of State\naction in industry.... Foreign investment, emigration, the\nindustrial policy which in recent years had regarded the whole\nworld as a market, are too dangerous. The old order of industry,\nwhich is dying to-day, is based on Profit; and the new Germany\nof the twentieth-century Power without consideration of Profit\nis to make an end of that system of Capitalism, which came\nover from England one hundred years ago.'\nExcept that no English author has yet to my knowledge dared\nopenly to disparage individual happiness, is there a passage in\nthis which is not mirrored in much of contemporary English\nliterature?\nAnd, undoubtedly, not merely the ideas which in Germany\nand elsewhere prepared totalitarianism, but also many of the\nprinciples of totalitarianism itself are what exercises an increas­\ning fascination in many other countries. Although few people, if\nanybody, in this country would probably be ready to swallow\ntotalitarianism whole, there are few single features which we\nhave not yet been advised by somebody or other to imitate.\nIndeed, there is scarcely a leaf out of Hitler's book which some­\nbody or other in this country has not recommended us to take\nand use for our own purposes. This applies particularly to many\npeople who are undoubtedly Hitler's mortal enemies because of\none special feature in his system. We should never forget that the\nanti-semitism of Hitler has driven from his country, or turned\nI EconomicJournal, 1915, p. 450.\n\f\n190 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\ninto his enemies, many people who in every respect are con­\nfirmed totalitarians of the German type.\n1\nNo description in general terms can give an adequate idea of\nthe similarity of much of current English political literature to\nthe works which destroyed the belief in Western civilisation in\nGermany and created the state of mind in which Nazism could\nbecome successful. The similarity is even more one of the tem­\nper with which the problems are approached than of the specific\narguments used-a similar readiness to break all cultural ties\nwith the past and to stake everything on the success of a particu­\nlar experiment. As was also true in Germany, most of the works\nwhich are preparing the way for a totalitarian course in this\ncountry are the product of sincere idealists and often of men of\nconsiderable intellectual distinction. So, although it is invidious\nto single out particular persons as illustrations where similar\nviews are advocated by hundreds of others, I see no other way of\ndemonstrating effectively how far this development has actually\nadvanced in this country. I shall deliberately choose as illustra­\ntions authors whose sincerity and disinterestedness are above\nsuspicion. But though I hope in this way to show how the views\nfrom which totalitarianism springs are now rapidly spreading\nhere, I stand little chance of conveying successfully the equally\nI Especially when we consider the proportion of former socialists who have\nbecome Nazis it is important to remember that the true significance of this\nratio is seen only if we compare it, not with the total number of former\nsocialists, but with the number of those whose conversion would not in any\ncase have been prevented by their ancestry. In fact, one of the surprising\nfeatures of the political emigration from Germany is the comparatively small\nnumber of refugees from the Left who are not \"Jews\" in the German sense of\nthe term.-How often do we not hear eulogies of the German system prefaced\nby some statement such as the following with which at a recent conference an\nenumeration of the \"features of the totalitarian technique of economic mobil­\nisation which are worth thinking about\" was introduced: \"Herr Hitler is not\nmy ideal-far from it.

Anyone who re-reads now the statements of\nBritish war aims of twenty-five years ago and compares them\nwith Professor Carr's present views will readily see that what\nwere then believed to be the German views are now those of\nProfessor Carr who would presumably argue that the different\nviews then professed in this country were merely a product of\nBritish hypocrisy. How little difference he is able to see between\nthe ideals held in this country and those practised by present -day\nGermany is best illustrated by his assertion that\nit is true that when a prominent National-Socialist asserts that\n\"anything that benefits the German people is right, anything\nthat harms them is wrong\" he is merely propounding the same\nidentification of national interest with universal right which has\nalready been established for English-speaking countries by\n[President] Wilson, Professor Toynbee, Lord Cecil, and many\nothers.\nSince Professor Carr's books are devoted to international prob­\nlems it is mainly in that field that their characteristic tendency\nbecomes apparent. But from the glimpses one gets of the char­\nacter of the future society which he contemplates, it appears also\nto be quite on the totalitarian model. Sometimes one even won­\nders whether the resemblance is accidental or deliberate. Does\nProfessor Carr, for example, realise, when he asserts that \"we can\nno longer find much meaning in the distinction familiar to\nnineteenth-century thought between 'society' and 'state''', that\nthis is precisely the doctrine of Professor Carl Schmitt, the lead­\ning Nazi theoretician of totalitarianism, and, in fact, the essence\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 193\nof the definition of totalitarianism which that author has given\nto that term which he himself had introduced?

But neither this, nor\nhis belief characteristically held at the same time, that the\nimportance of the economic factor in social life is rapidly\ndecreasing, prevent him from basing on economic arguments all\nhis predictions about the inevitable developments or from pre­\nsenting as his main demands for the future \"the reinterpretation\nin predominantly economic terms of the democratic ideals of\n'equality' and 'liberty'''!\nProfessor Carr's contempt for all the ideas of liberal econo­\nmists (which he insists on calling nineteenth-century ideas,\nthough he knows that Germany \"had never really shared\" them\nand had already in the nineteenth century practised most of the\nprinciples he now advocates), is as profound as that of any of\nthe German writers quoted in the last chapter. He even takes over\nthe German thesis, originated by Friedrich List, that Free Trade\nwas a policy dictated solely by, and appropriate only to, the\nspecial interests of England in the nineteenth century. Now,\nhowever, \"the artificial production of some degree of autarky is a\nnecessary condition of orderly social existence\". To bring about\na \"return to a more dispersed and generalised world trade ... by\na 'removal of trade barriers' or by a resuscitation of the laissez-faire\nprinciples of the nineteenth century\" is \"unthinkable\".

This is all very familiar-but it was not in the\nworks of English scholars that one expected to find these views.\n* * * * *\nPossibly we have not yet given enough attention to one feature\nof the intellectual development in Germany during the last hun­\ndred years which is now in an almost identical form making its\nappearance in this country: the scientists agitating for a \"scien­\ntific\" organisation of society. The ideal of a society organised\n\"through and through\" from the top has in Germany been con­\nsiderably furthered by the quite unique influence which her\nscientific and technological specialists were allowed to exercise\non the formation of social and political opinions. Few people\nremember that in the modern history of Germany the political\nprofessors have played a role comparable to that of the political\nlawyers in France. 1 The influence of these scientist-politicians\nwas of late years not often on the side of liberty: the \"intolerance\nof reason\" so frequently conspicuous in the scientific specialist,\nthe impatience with the ways of the ordinary man so character­\nistic of the expert, and the contempt for anything which was not\nconsciously organised by superior minds according to a scien­\ntific blueprint, were phenomena familiar in German public life\nfor generations before they became of significance in this coun­\ntry.

One of the most famous of\nGerman Scientists, the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond, was not ashamed,\nin an oration delivered in 1870 in his double capacity of Rector of the Uni­\nversity of Berlin and President of the Prussian Academy of Science, to proclaim\nthat \"We, the University of Berlin, quartered opposite the King's palace, are, by\nthe deed of our foundation, the intellectual bodyguard of the House of Hohen­\nzollern.\" (A Speech on the German War, London 1870, p. 31.-It is remarkable that\ndu Bois-Reymond should have thought it advisable to issue an English edition\nof this oration.)\n3 It will suffice to quote one foreign witness: Mr. R. A. Brady, in his study of The\nSpirit and Structureof German Fascism, concludes his detailed account of the devel­\nopment in the German academic world with the statement that \"the scientist,\nper se, is hence, perhaps, the most easily used and 'coordinated' of all the\nespecially trained people in modem society. The Nazis, to be true, fired a good\nmany University professors, and dismissed a good many scientists from\nresearch laboratories. But the professors were primarily among the social sci­\nences where there was more common awareness of and a more persistent\ncriticism of the Nazi programmes, and not among the natural sciences where\nthinking is supposed to be most rigorous. Those dismissed in this latter field\nwere primarily Jewish or exceptions to the generalisations made above,\nbecause of the equally uncritical acceptance of beliefs running contrary to Nazi\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 197\nThe role which the intellectuals played in the totalitarian\ntransformation of society was prophetically foreseen in another\ncountry by Julien Benda, whose Trahison des CJeres assumes new\nsignificance when one now re-reads it, fifteen years after it has\nbeen written. There is particularly one passage in that work\nwhich deserves to be well pondered and kept in mind when we\ncome to consider certain examples of the excursions of British\nscientists into politics. It is the passage in which M. Benda speaks\nof the\nsuperstition of science held to be competent in all domains,\nincluding that of morality; a superstition which, I repeat, is an\nacquisition of the nineteenth century. It remains to discover\nwhether those who brandish this doctrine believe in it or\nwhether they simply want to give the prestige of a scientific\nappearance to passions of their hearts, which they perfectly\nknow are nothing but passions. It is to be noted that the dogma\nthat history is obedient to scientific laws is preached especially\nby partisans of arbitrary authority. This is quite natural, since it\neliminates the two realities they most hate, i.e. human liberty\nand the historical action of the individual.\nWe have already had occasion to mention one English product\nof this kind, a work in which, on a Marxist background, all the\ncharacteristic idiosyncrasies of the totalitarian intellectual, a\nhatred of almost everything which distinguishes European civil­\nisation since the Renaissance, is combined with an approval of\nthe methods of Inquisition. We do not wish to consider here\nsuch an extreme case and shall take a work which is more\nrepresentative and which has achieved considerable publiCity.\nviews.--Consequently the Nazis were able to 'co-ordinate' scholars and\nscientists with relative ease, and hence to throw behind their elaborate propa­\nganda the seeming weight of the bulk of German learned opinion and\nsupport.\"\n\f\n198 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nDr. C. H. Waddington's little book under the characteristic title\nThe Scientific Attitude is as good an example as any of a class of\nliterature which is actively sponsored by the influential weekly\nNature and which combines claims for greater political power for\nthe scientists with an ardent advocacy of wholesale \"planning\".\nThough not quite as outspoken in his contempt for freedom as\nMr. Crowther, Dr. Waddington is hardly more reassuring. He\ndiffers from most of the writers of the same kind in that he\nclearly sees and even emphasises that the tendencies he describes\nand supports inevitably lead to a totalitarian system. Yet appar­\nently this appears to him preferable to what he describes as \"the\npresent ferocious monkey-house civilisation\".\nDr. Waddington's claim that the scientist is qualified to run a\ntotalitarian society is based mainly on his thesis that\" science can\npass ethical judgment on human behaviour\", a claim to the\nelaboration of which by Dr. Waddington Nature has given con­\nsiderable publicity. It is, of course, a thesis which has long been\nfamiliar to the German scientist-politicians and which has justly\nbeen singled out by ]. Benda. For an illustration of what this\nmeans we do not need to go outside Dr. Waddington's book.\nFreedom, he explains, \"is a very troublesome concept for the\nscientist to discuss, partly because he is not convinced that, in\nthe last analysis, there is such a thing\". Nevertheless we are told\nthat \"science recognises\" this and that kind of freedom, but \"the\nfreedom to be odd and unlike one's neighbour is not ... a\nscientific value\". Apparently the \"harlot humanities\", about\nwhich Dr. Waddington has to say many uncomplimentary\nthings, have gravely misled us in teaching us tolerance!\nThat when it comes to social and economic questions this\nbook on the \"scientific attitude\" is anything but scientific is what\none has learnt to expect of this kind of literature. We find again\nall the familiar cliches and baseless generalisations about \"poten­\ntial plenty\" and the inevitable tendency towards monopoly,\nthough the \"best authorities\" quoted in support of these\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 199\ncontentions prove on examination to be mostly political tracts of\nquestionable scientific standing, while the serious studies of the\nsame problems are conspicuously neglected.\nAs in almost all works of this type, Dr. Waddington's convic­\ntions are largely determined by his belief in \"inevitable historical\ntendencies\" which science is presumed to have discovered and\nwhich he derives from \"the profound scientific philosophy\" of\nMarxism whose basic notions are\" almost, if not quite, identical\nwith those underlying the scientific approach to nature\" and\nwhich his \"competence to judge\" tells Dr. Waddington are an\nadvance on anything which has gone before. Thus Dr. Wad­\ndington, though he finds it \"difficult to deny that England now\nis a worse country to live in than it was\" in 1913, looks forward\nto an economic system which \"will be centralised and totalitar­\nian in the sense that all aspects of the economic development of\nlarge regions are consciously planned as an integrated whole\".\nAnd for his facile optimism that in this totalitarian system free­\ndom of thought will be preserved, his \"scientific attitude\" has\nno better counsel than the conviction that \"there must be very\nvaluable evidence about questions which one does not need to\nbe an expert to understand\", such as, for example, whether it is\npossible \"to combine totalitarianism with freedom of thought\".\n* * * * *\nA fuller survey of the various tendencies towards totalitarianism\nin this country would have to give considerable attention to the\nvarious attempts to create some kind of middle-class socialism\nbearing no doubt unknown to their authors an alarming resem­\nblance to similar developments in pre-Hitler Germany.l If we\n1 Another element which after this war is likely to strengthen the tendencies in\nthis direction will be some of the men who during the war have tasted the\npowers of coercive control and will find it difficult to reconcile themselves\nwith the humbler roles they will then have to play. Though after the last war\nmen of this kind were not as numerous as they will probably be in the future,\n\f\n200 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nwere concerned here with political movements proper we should\nhave to consider such new organisations as the \"Forward March\"\nor \"Common Wealth\" movement of Sir Richard Acland, the\nauthor of UnserKampf, or the activities of the \"1941 Committee\" of\nMr. J. B. Priestley, at one time associated with the former. But,\nthough it would be unwise to disregard the symptomatic signifi­\ncance of such phenomena as these, they can hardly yet be counted\nas important political forces. Apart from the intellectual influ­\nences which we have illustrated by two instances, the impetus of\nthe movement towards totalitarianism comes mainly from the\ntwo great vested interests, organised capital and organised labour.\nProbably the greatest menace of all is the fact that the policies of\nthese two most powerful groups point in the same direction.\nThey do this through their common, and often concerted,\nsupport of the monopolistic organisation of industry; and it is\nthis tendency which is the great immediate danger. While there\nis no reason to believe that this movement is inevitable, there can\nbe little doubt that if we continue on the path we have been\ntreading, it will lead us to totalitarianism.\nThis movement is, of course, deliberately planned mainly by\nthe capitalist organisers of monopolies, and they are thus one of\nthe main sources of this danger. Their responsibility is not\naltered by the fact that their aim is not a totalitarian system but\nrather a sort of corporative society in which the organised indus­\ntries would appear as semi-independent and self-governing\n\"estates\". But they are as short-sighted as were their German\ncolleagues in believing that they will be allowed not only to\ncreate but also for any length of time to run such a system. The\ndecisions which the managers of such an organised industry\nthey exercised even then a not inconsiderable influence on the economic policy\nof this country. It was in the company of some of these men that as long as ten\nor twelve years ago I first experienced in this country the then still unusual\nsensation of being suddenly transported into what I had learnt to regard as a\nthoroughly \"German\", intellectual atmosphere."

Very frequently\neven measures aimed against the monopolists in fact serve only\nto strengthen the power of monopoly. Every raid on the gains of\nmonopoly, be it in the interest of particular groups or of the\nstate as a whole, tends to create new vested interests which will\nhelp to bolster up monopoly. A system in which large privileged\ngroups profit from the gains of monopoly may be politically\nmuch more dangerous, and monopoly in such a system certainly\nis much more powerful, than in one where the profits go to a\nlimited few. But though it should be clear that, for example, the\nhigher wages which the monopolist is in a position to pay are\njust as much the result of exploitation as his own profit, and are\njust as certain to make poorer not only all the consumers but still\nmore all other wage earners, not merely those who benefit from\nit but the public generally nowadays accept the ability to pay\nhigher wages as a legitimate argument in favour of monopoly. 2\nThere is serious reason for doubt whether even in those cases\nwhere monopoly is inevitable the best way of controlling it is to\nput it in the hands of the state. If only a single industry were in\nquestion this might well be so. But when we have to deal with\nmany different monopolistic industries, there is much to be said\nI Cf. on this the recent instructive article on \"Monopoly and the Law\", by\nW Arthur Lewis, in The Modern Law Review, vol. VI, no. 3, April 1943.\n2 Even more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable tenderness which many\nsocialists are apt to show towards the rentier bondholder to whom monopolist\norganisation of industry frequently guarantees secure incomes. That their blind\nenmity to profits should lead people to represent effortless fixed income as\nsocially or ethically more desirable than profits, and to accept even monopoly\nto secure such a guaranteed income to, for example, railway bondholders, is\none of the most extraordinary symptoms of the perversion of values which has\ntaken place during the last generation.\n\f\nTHE TOTALITARIANS IN OUR MIDST 203\nfor leaving them in different private hands rather than combin­\ning them under the single control of the state. Even if railways,\nroad and air transport, or the supply of gas and electricity, were\nall inevitably monopolies, the consumer is unquestionably in a\nmuch stronger position so long as they remain separate monop­\nolies than when they are \"co-ordinated\" by a central control.\nPrivate monopoly is scarcely ever complete and even more rarely\nof long duration or able to disregard potential competition.\nBut a state monopoly is always a state-protected monopoly­\nprotected against both potential competition and effective criti­\ncism. It means in most instances that a temporary monopoly is\ngiven the power to secure its position for all time-a power\nalmost certain to be used. Where the power which ought to\ncheck and control monopoly becomes interested in sheltering\nand defending its appointees, where for the government to rem­\nedy an abuse is to admit responsibility for it, and where criticism\nof the actions of monopoly means criticism of the government,\nthere is little hope of monopoly becoming the servant of the\ncommunity. A state which is entangled in all directions in the\nrunning of monopolistic enterprise, while it would possess\ncrushing power over the individual, would yet be a weak state in\nso far as its freedom in formulating policy is concerned. The\nmachinery of monopoly becomes identical with the machinery\nof the state, and the state itself becomes more and more identi­\nfied with the interests of those who run things than with the\ninterests of the people in general.\nThe probability is that wherever monopoly is really inevitable\nthe plan which used to be preferred by the Americans, of a\nstrong state control over private monopolies, if consistently pur­\nsued, offers a better chance of satisfactory results than state man­\nagement.

Not\nonly demands, like those of the resolution, adopted on Professor\nLaski's motion, which requires the retention in peace time of the\n\"measures of Government control needed for mobilising the\nnational resources in war\", but all the characteristic catchwords,\nsuch as the \"balanced economy\" which Professor Laski now\ndemands for Great Britain, or the \"community consumption\"\ntowards which production is to be centrally directed, are bodily\ntaken over from the German ideology. Twenty-five years ago\nthere was perhaps still some excuse for holding the naive belief\n\"that a planned society can be a far more free society than the\ncompetitive laissez-faireorder it has come to replace\".1 But to find\nit once more held after twenty-five years of experience and the\nre-examination of the old beliefs to which this experience has\nled, and at a time when we are fighting the results of those very\ndoctrines, is tragic beyond words. That the great party which in\nParliament and public opinion has largely taken the place of the\nprogressive parties of the past, should have ranged itself with\nwhat, in the light of all past development, must be regarded as a\nreactionary movement, is the decisive change which has taken\nplace in our time and the source of the mortal danger to every­\nthing a liberal must value. That the advances of the past should\nbe threatened by the traditionalist forces of the Right is a phe­\nnomenon of all ages which need not alarm us. But if the place of\nthe opposition, in public discussion as well as in Parliament,\nshould become lastingly the monopoly of a second reactionary\nparty, there would indeed be no hope left.\n1 The Old World and the New Society, an Interim Report of the National Executive of\nthe British Labour Party on the Problems of Reconstruction, pp. 12 and 16.\n\f\n14\nMATERIAL CONDITIONS AND\nIDEAL ENDS\nIs it just or reasonable, that most voices against the main end\nof government should enslave the less number that would be\nfree? More just it is, doubtless, if it come to force, that a less\nnumber compel a greater to retain, which can be no wrong to\nthem, their liberty, than that a greater number, for the pleas­\nure of their baseness, compel a less most injuriously to be\ntheir fellow slaves. They who seek nothing but their own just\nliberty, have always the right to win it, whenever they have the\npower, be the voices never so numerous that oppose it.\nJohn Milton.\nOur generation likes to flatter itself that it attaches less weight to\neconomic considerations than did its parents or grandparents.\nThe \"End of Economic Man\" bids fair to become one of the\ngoverning myths of our age. Before we accept this claim, or treat\nthe change as praiseworthy, we must inquire a little further how\nfar it is true. When we consider the claims for social reconstruc­\ntion which are most strongly pressed it appears that they are\n\f\n208 TH E ROAD TO SERFDOM\nalmost all economic in character: we have seen already that the\n\"re-interpretation in economic terms\" of the political ideals of\nthe past, of liberty, equality, and security, is one of the main\ndemands of people who at the same time proclaim the end of\neconomic man. Nor can there be much doubt that in their\nbeliefs and aspirations men are to-day more than ever before\ngoverned by economic doctrines, by the carefully fostered belief\nin the irrationality of our economic system, by the false asser­\ntions about \"potential plenty\", pseudo-theories about the inevit­\nable trend towards monopoly, and the impression created by\ncertain much advertised occurrences such as the destruction of\nstocks of raw materials or the suppression of inventions, for\nwhich competition is blamed, though they are precisely the\nsort of thing which could not happen under competition and\nwhich are made possible only by monopoly and usually by\ngovernment-aided monopoly.l\nIn a different sense, however, it is no doubt true that our\ngeneration is less willing to listen to economic considerations\nthan was true of its predecessors. It is most decidedly unwilling\nto sacrifice any of its demands to what are called economic\narguments, it is impatient and intolerant of all restraints on their\nimmediate ambitions, and unwilling to bow to economic neces­\nsities. It is not any contempt for material welfare, or even any\ndiminished desire for it, but, on the contrary, a refusal to recog­\nnise any obstacles, any conflict with other aims which might\nI The frequent use that is made of the occasional destruction of wheat, coffee,\netc., as an argument against competition is a good illustration of the intellectual\ndishonesty of much of this argument, since a little reflection will show that in a\ncompetitive market no owner of such stocks can gain by their destruction. The\ncase of the alleged suppression of useful patents is more complicated and\ncannot be adequately discussed in a note; but the conditions in which it would\nbe profitable to put into cold storage a patent which in the social interest ought to be\nused are so exceptional that it is more than doubtful whether this has happened\nin any important instance.\n\f\nMATERIAL CONDITIONS AND IDEAL ENDS 209\nimpede the fulfilment of their own desires, which distinguishes\nour generation. Economophobia would be a more correct\ndescription of this attitude than the doubly misleading \"End of\nEconomic Man\", which suggests a change from a state of affairs\nwhich has never existed in a direction in which we are not\nmoving. Man has come to hate, and to revolt against, the\nimpersonal forces to which in the past he submitted even\nthough they have often frustrated his individual efforts.\nThis revolt is an instance of a much more general phenom­\nenon, a new unwillingness to submit to any rule or necessity the\nrationaleof which man does not understand; it makes itself felt in\nmany fields of life, particularly in that of morals; and it is often a\ncommendable attitude. But there are fields where this craving for\nintelligibility cannot be fully satisfied and where at the same\ntime a refusal to submit to anything we cannot understand must\nlead to the destruction of our civilisation. Though it is natural\nthat, as the world around us becomes more complex, our resist­\nance grows against the forces which, without our understanding\nthem, constantly interfere with individual hopes and plans, it is\njust in these circumstances that it becomes less and less possible\nfor anyone fully to understand these forces. A complex civilisa­\ntion like ours is necessarily based on the individual adjusting\nhimself to changes whose cause and nature he cannot under­\nstand: why he should have more or less, why he should have to\nmove to another occupation, why some things he wants should\nbecome more difficult to get than others, will always be con­\nnected with such a multitude of circumstances that no single\nmind will be able to grasp them; or, even worse, those affected\nwill put all the blame on an obvious immediate and avoidable\ncause, while the more complex interrelationships which deter­\nmine the change remain inevitably hidden to them. Even the\ndirector of a completely planned society, if he wanted to give an\nadequate explanation to anyone why he has to be directed to a\ndifferent job, or why his remuneration has to be changed, could\n\f\n210 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nnot fully do so without explaining and vindicating his whole\nplan-which means, of course, that it could not be explained to\nmore than a few.\nIt was men's submission to the impersonal forces of the mar­\nket that in the past has made possible the growth of a civilisation\nwhich without this could not have developed; it is by thus sub­\nmitting that we are every day helping to build something that is\ngreater than anyone of us can fully comprehend. It does not\nmatter whether men in the past did submit from beliefs which\nsome now regard as superstitious: from a religious spirit of\nhumility, or an exaggerated respect for the crude teachings of\nthe early economists. The crucial point is that it is infinitely more\ndifficult rationally to comprehend the necessity of submitting to\nforces whose operation we cannot follow in detail, than to do so\nout of the humble awe which religion, or even the respect for\nthe doctrines of economics, did inspire. It may indeed be the\ncase that infinitely more intelligence on the part of everybody\nwould be needed than anybody now possesses, if we were even\nmerely to maintain our present complex civilisation without\nanybody having to do things of which he does not comprehend\nthe necessity. The refusal to yield to forces which we neither\nunderstand nor can recognise as the conscious decisions of an\nintelligent being is the product of an incomplete and therefore\nerroneous rationalism. It is incomplete because it fails to com­\nprehend that the co-ordination of the multifarious individual\nefforts in a complex society must take account of facts no indi­\nvidual can completely survey. And it fails to see that, unless this\ncomplex society is to be destroyed, the only alternative to sub­\nmission to the impersonal and seemingly irrational forces of the\nmarket is submission to an equally uncontrollable and therefore\narbitrary power of other men. In his anxiety to escape the irk­\nsome restraints which he now feels, man does not realise that the\nnew authoritarian restraints which will have to be deliberately\nimposed in their stead will be even more painful.\n\f\nMATERIAL CONDITIONS AND IDEAL ENDS 211\nThose who argue that we have to an astounding degree\nlearned to master the forces of nature but are sadly behind in\nmaking successful use of the possibilities of social collaboration\nare quite right so far as this statement goes. But they are mistaken\nwhen they carry the comparison further and argue that we must\nlearn to master the forces of society in the same manner in\nwhich we have learnt to master the forces of nature. This is not\nonly the path to totalitarianism, but the path to the destruction\nof our civilisation and a certain way to block future progress.\nThose who demand it show by their very demands that they have\nnot yet comprehended the extent to which the mere preservation\nof what we have so far achieved depends on the co-ordination of\nindividual efforts by impersonal forces.\n* * * * *\nWe must now return briefly to the crucial point, that individual\nfreedom cannot be reconciled with the supremacy of one single\npurpose to which the whole society must be entirely and per­\nmanently subordinated. The only exception to the rule that a free\nsociety must not be subjected to a single purpose is war and\nother temporary disasters when subordination of almost every­\nthing to the immediate and pressing need is the price at which\nwe preserve our freedom in the long run. This explains also why\nso many of the fashionable phrases about doing for the purposes\nof peace what we have learnt to do for the purposes of war are so\nvery misleading: it is sensible temporarily to sacrifice freedom in\norder to make it more secure in the future; but the same cannot\nbe said for a system proposed as a permanent arrangement.\nThat no single purpose must be allowed in peace to have\nabsolute preference over all others applies even to the one aim\nwhich everybody now agrees comes in the front rank: the con­\nquest of unemployment. There can be no doubt that this must be\nthe goal of our greatest endeavour; even so, it does not mean that\nsuch an aim should be allowed to dominate us to the exclusion\n\f\n212 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nof everything else, that, as the glib phrase runs, it must be\naccomplished \"at any price\". It is, in fact, in this field that the\nfascination of vague but popular phrases like \"full employment\"\nmay well lead to extremely short-sighted measures, and where\nthe categorical and irresponsible \"it must be done at all cost\" of\nthe single-minded idealist is likely to do the greatest harm.\nIt is of very great importance that we should approach with\nopen eyes the task which in this field we shall have to face after\nthe war, and that we should clearly realise what we may hope to\nachieve. One of the dominant features of the immediate post­\nwar situation will be that the special needs of war have drawn\nhundreds of thousands of men and women into specialised jobs\nwhere during the war they have been able to earn relatively high\nwages. There will, in many instances, be no possibility of\nemploying the same numbers in these particular trades. There\nwill be an urgent need for the transfer of large numbers to other\njobs, and many of them will find that the work they can then get\nis less favourably remunerated than was true of their war job.\nEven re-training, which certainly ought to be provided on a\nliberal scale, cannot entirely overcome this problem. There will\nstill be many people who, if they are to be paid according to\nwhat their services will then be worth to society, would under\nany system have to be content with a lowering of their material\nposition relative to that of others.\nIf, then, the trade unions successfully resist any lowering of\nthe wages of the particular groups in question, there will be only\ntwo alternatives open: either coercion will have to be used, Le.\ncertain individuals will have to b~ selected for compulsory trans­\nfer to other and relatively less well paid positions, or those who\ncan no longer be employed at the relatively high wages they have\nearned during the war must be allowed to remain unemployed\ntill they are willing to accept work at a relatively lower wage.\nThis is a problem which would arise in a socialist society no less\nthan in any other; and the great majority of workmen would\n\f\nMATERIAL CON DITIONS AN D I DEAL EN DS 213\nprobably be just as little inclined to guarantee in perpetuity their\npresent wages to those who were drawn into specially well paid\nemployments because of the special need of war. A socialist\nsociety would certainly use coercion in this position. The point\nthat is relevant for us is that if we are determined not to allow\nunemployment at any price, and are not willing to use coercion,\nwe shall be driven to all sorts of desperate expedients, none of\nwhich can bring any lasting relief and all of which will seriously\ninterfere with the most productive use of our resources. It\nshould be specially noted that monetary policy cannot provide a\nreal cure for this difficulty except by a general and considerable\ninflation, sufficient to raise all other wages and prices relatively\nto those which cannot be lowered, and that even this would\nbring about the desired result only by effecting in a concealed\nand underhand fashion that reduction of real wages which could\nnot be brought about directly. Yet to raise all other wages and\nincomes to an extent sufficient to adjust the position of the\ngroup in question would involve an inflationary expansion on\nsuch a scale that the disturbances, hardships, and injustices\ncaused would be much greater than those to be cured.\nThis problem, which will arise in a particularly acute form\nafter the war, is one which will always be with us so long as the\neconomic system has to adapt itself to continuous changes.\nThere will always be a possible maximum of employment in the\nshort run which can be achieved by giving all people employ­\nment where they happen to be and which can be achieved by\nmonetary expansion. But not only can this maximum be main­\ntained solely by progressive inflationary expansion and with the\neffect of holding up those redistributions of labour between\nindustries made necessary by the changed circumstances, and\nwhich so long as workmen are free to choose their jobs will\nalways come about only with some delays and thereby cause\nsome unemployment: to aim always at the maximum of\nemployment achievable by monetary means is a policy which is"

The adjustments that will be needed if we are to recover\nand surpass our former standards will be greater than any similar\nadjustments we had to make in the past; and only if everyone of\nus is ready individually to obey the necessities of this readjust­\nment shall we be able to get through a difficult period as free\nmen who can choose their own way of life.

Can there be\nmuch doubt that the feeling of personal obligation to remedy\ninequities, where our individual power permits, has been weak­\nened rather than strengthened, that both the willingness to bear\nresponsibility and the consciousness that it is our own individual\nduty to know how to choose have been perceptibly impaired?\nThere is all the difference between demanding that a desirable\nstate of affairs should be brought about by the authorities or\neven being willing to submit provided everyone else is made to\ndo the same, and the readiness to do what one thinks right\noneself at the sacrifice of one's own desires and perhaps in the\nface of hostile public opinion. There is much to suggest that we\nhave in fact become more tolerant towards particular abuses, and\nmuch more indifferent to inequities in individual cases, since we\nhave fixed our eyes on an entirely different system in which the\nstate will set everything right. It may even be, as has been\nsuggested, that the passion for collective action is a way in which\nwe now without compunction collectively indulge in that\nselfishness which as individuals we had learnt a little to restrain.\nIt is true that the virtues which are less esteemed and practised\nnow-independence, self-reliance, and the willingness to bear\nrisks, the readiness to back one's own conviction against a\nmajority, and the willingness to voluntary co-operations with\none's neighbours-are essentially those on which the working of\nan individualist society rests. Collectivism has nothing to put in\ntheir place, and in so far as it already has destroyed them it has left\na void filled by nothing but the demand for obedience and the\ncompulsion of the individual to do what is collectively decided\nto be good. The periodical election ofrepresentatives, to which the\nmoral choice ofthe individual tends to be more and more reduced,\nis not an occasion on which his moral values are tested or where he\nhas constantly to reassert and prove the order of his values, and to\ntestify to the sincerity of his profession by the sacrifice of those of\nhis values he rates lower to those he puts higher.\n\f\nMATERIAL CONDITIONS AND IDEAL ENDS 219\nAs the rules of conduct evolved by individuals are the source\nfrom which collective political action derives what moral stand­\nards it possesses, it would indeed be surprising if the relaxation\nof the standards of individual conduct were accompanied by a\nraising of the standards of social action. That there have been\ngreat changes is clear. Every generation, of course, puts some\nvalues higher and some lower than its predecessors. Which,\nhowever, are the aims which take a lower place now, which are\nthe values which we are now warned may have to give way if\nthey come into conflict with others? Which kind of values figure\nless prominently in the picture of the future held out to us by the\npopular writers and speakers than they did in the dreams and\nhopes of our fathers? It is certainly not material comfort, cer­\ntainly not a rise in our standard of living or the assurance of a\ncertain status in society which ranks lower. Is there a popular\nwriter or speaker who dares to suggest to the masses that they\nmight have to make sacrifices of their material prospects for the\nenhancement of an ideal end? Is it not, in fact, entirely the other\nway round? Are not the things which we are more and more\nfrequently taught to regard as \"nineteenth-century illusions\" all\nmoral values-liberty and independence, truth and intellectual\nhonesty, peace and democracy, and the respect for the individual\nqua man instead of merely as the member of an organised\ngroup?

Many kinds of economic planning are indeed\npracticable only if the planning authority can effectively shut out\nall extraneous influences; the result of such planning is therefore\ninevitably the piling up of restrictions on the movements of men\nand goods.\nLess obvious but by no means less real are the dangers to\npeace arising out of the artificially fostered economic solidarity\nof all the inhabitants of anyone country, and from the new\nblocks of opposed interests created by planning on a national\nscale.

If the resources of different nations are treated as\nexclusive properties of these nations as wholes, if international\neconomic relations, instead of being relations between indi­\nviduals, become increasingly relations between whole nations\norganised as trading bodies, they inevitably become the source\nof friction and envy between whole nations. It is one of the most\nfatal illusions that by substituting negotiations between states\nor organised groups for competition for markets or for raw\nmaterials, international friction would be reduced. This would\nmerely put a contest of force in the place of what can only\nmetaphorically be called the \"struggle\" of competition, and\ntransfer to powerful and armed states, subject to no superior law,\nthe rivalries which between individuals had to be decided with­\nout recourse to force. Economic transactions between national\nbodies who are at the same time the supreme judges of their\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 227\nown behaviour, who bow to no superior law, and whose repre­\nsentatives cannot be bound by any considerations but the\nimmediate interest of their respective nations, must end in\nclashes of power. 1\nIf we were to make no better use of victory than to counten­\nance existing trends in this direction, only too visible before\n1939, we might indeed find that we have defeated National­\nSocialism merely to create a world of many national socialisms,\ndiffering in detail, but all equally totalitarian, nationalistic, and\nin recurrent conflict with each other. The Germans would appear\nas the disturbers of peace, as they already do to some people,2\nmerely because they were the first to take the path along which\nall the others were ultimately to follow.\n* * * * *\nThose who at least partly realise these dangers usually draw the\nconclusion that economic planning must be done \"internation­\nally\", Le. by some super-national authority. But though this\nwould avert some of the obvious dangers raised by planning on a\nnational scale, it seems that those who advocate such ambitious\nschemes have little conception of the even greater difficulties and\ndangers which their proposals create. The problems raised by a\nconscious direction of economic affairs on a national scale\ninevitably assume even greater dimensions when the same is\nattempted internationally. The conflict between planning and\nfreedom cannot but become more serious as the similarity of\nstandards and values among those submitted to a unitary plan\ndiminishes. There need be little difficulty in planning the eco­\nnomic life of a family, comparatively little in a small community.\n1 On all these and on the following points, which can be touched upon only\nvery briefly, see Professor Lionel Robbins's EconomicPlanningand InternationalOrder,\n1937, passim.\n2 See particularly the significant book by James Burnham, The Managerial\nRevolution, 1941 .\n\f\n228 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nBut as the scale increases, the amount of agreement on the order\nof ends decreases and the necessity to rely on force and compul­\nsion grows. In a small community common views on the relative\nimportance of the main tasks, agreed standards of value, will\nexist on a great many subjects. But their number will become\nless and less the wider we throw the net: and as there is less\ncommunity of views, the necessity to rely on force and coercion\nincreases.\nThe people of anyone country may easily be persuaded to\nmake a sacrifice in order to assist what they regard as \"their\" iron\nindustry or \"their\" agriculture, or in order that in their country\nnobody should sink below a certain level. So long as it is a ques­\ntion of helping people whose habits of life and ways of thinking\nare familiar to us, of correcting the distribution of incomes\namong, or the working conditions of, people we can well\nimagine and whose views on their appropriate status are funda­\nmentally similar to ours, we are usually ready to make some\nsacrifices. But one has only to visualise the problems raised by\neconomic planning of even an area such as Western Europe to see\nthat the moral bases for such an undertaking are completely\nlacking. Who imagines that there exist any common ideals of\ndistributive justice such as will make the Norwegian fisherman\nconsent to forgo the prospect of economic improvement in order\nto help his Portuguese fellow, or the Dutch worker to pay more\nfor his bicycle to help the Coventry mechanic, or the French\npeasant to pay more taxes to assist the industrialisation of Italy?\nIf most people are not willing to see the difficulty this is\nmainly because, consciously or unconsciously, they assume that\nit will be they who will settle these questions for the others, and\nbecause they are convinced of their own capacity to do this justly\nand equitably. English people, perhaps even more than others,\nbegin to realise what such schemes mean only when it is\npresented to them that they might be a minority in the\nplanning authority, and that the main lines of the future\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 229\neconomic development of Great Britain might be determined by\na non-British majority. How many people in this country would\nbe prepared to submit to the decision of an international author­\nity, however democratically constituted, which had power to\ndecree that the development of the Spanish iron industry must\nhave precedence over similar development in South Wales, that\nthe optical industry had better be concentrated in Germany to\nthe exclusion of Great Britain, or that only fully refined\npetrol should be imported to Great Britain and all the industries\nconnected with refining reserved for the producer countries?\nTo imagine that the economic life of a vast area comprising\nmany different people can be directed or planned by democratic\nprocedure betrays a complete lack of awareness of the problems\nsuch planning would raise. Planning on an international scale,\neven more than is true on a national scale, cannot be anything\nbut a naked rule of force, an imposition by a small group on all\nthe rest of that sort of standard and employment which the\nplanners think suitable for the rest. If anything is certain it is that\nGrossraumwirtschaftof the kind at which the Germans have been\naiming can be successfully realised only by a master race, a\nHerrenvolk,ruthlessly imposing its aims and ideas on the rest. It is\na mistake to regard the brutality and the disregard of all the\nwishes and ideals of the smaller people shown by the Germans\nsimply as a sign of their special wickedness; it is the nature of the\ntask they have assumed which makes these things inevitable. To\nundertake the direction of the economic life of people with\nwidely divergent ideals and values is to assume responsibilities\nwhich commit one to the use of force; it is to assume a position\nwhere the best intentions cannot prevent one from being forced\nto act in a way which to some of those affected must appear\nhighly immoral. 1\n1 The experience in the colonial sphere, of this country as much as of any other,\nhas amply shown that even the mild forms of planning which we know as\n\f\n230 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nThis is true even if we assume the dominant power to be as\nidealistic and unselfish as we can possibly conceive. But how\nsmall is the likelihood that it will be unselfish, and how great are\nthe temptations! I believe the standards of decency and fairness,\nparticularly with regard to international affairs, to be as high, if\nnot higher, in this than in any other country. Yet even now we\ncan hear people arguing that victory must be used to create\nconditions in which British industry will be able to utilise to the\nfull the particular equipment which it has built up during the\nwar, that the reconstruction of Europe must be so directed as to\nfit in with the special requirements of the industries of this\ncountry, and to secure to everybody in this country the kind of\nemployment for which he thinks himself most fit. The alarming\nthing about these suggestions is not that they are made, but that\nthey are made in all innocence and regarded as a matter of\ncourse by decent people who are completely unaware of the\nmoral enormity which the use of force for such purposes\ninvolves.1\n* * * * *\ncolonial development involve, whether we wish it or not, the imposition of\ncertain values and ideals on those whom we try to assist. It is, indeed, this\nexperience which has made even the most internationally minded of colonial\nexperts so very sceptical of the practicability of an \"international\" administra­\ntion of colonies.\n1 If anyone should still fail to see the difficulties, or cherish the belief that with\na little good will they can all be overcome, it will help if he tries to follow the\nimplications of central direction of economic activity applied on a world scale.\nCan there be much doubt that this would mean a more or less conscious\nendeavour to secure the dominance of the white man, and would rightly be so\nregarded by all other races? Till I find a sane person who seriously believes that\nthe European races will voluntarily submit to their standard of life and rate of\nprogress being determined by a World Parliament, I cannot regard such plans\nas anything but absurd. But this does unfortunately not preclude that particular\nmeasures, which could be justified only if the principle of world direction\nwere a feasible ideal, are seriously advocated.\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 231\nPerhaps the most powerful agent in creating the belief in the\npossibility of a single central direction by democratic means of\nthe economic life of many different peoples is the fatal delusion\nthat if the decisions were left to the \"people\" , the community of\ninterest of the working classes would readily overcome the dif­\nferences which exist between the ruling classes. There is every\nreason to expect that with world planning the clash of economic\ninterests which arises now about the economic policy of anyone\nnation would in fact appear in even fiercer form as a clash of\ninterests between whole peoples which could be decided only\nby force. On the questions which an international planning\nauthority would have to decide, the interests and opinions of the\nworking classes of the different people will inevitably be as\nmuch in conflict, and there will be even less of a commonly\naccepted basis for an equitable settlement, than there is with\nrespect to different classes in anyone country. To the worker in a\npoor country the demand of his more fortunate colleague to be\nprotected against his low wage competition by minimum wage\nlegislation, supposedly in his interest, is frequently no more than\na means to deprive him of his only chance to better his condi­\ntions by overcoming natural disadvantages by working at wages\nlower than his fellows in other countries. And to him the fact\nthat he has to give the product of ten hours of his labour for\nthe product of five hours of the man elsewhere who is better\nequipped with machinery is as much \"exploitation\" as that\npractised by any capitalist.\nIt is fairly certain that in a planned international system the\nwealthier and therefore most powerful nations would to a very\nmuch greater degree than in a free economy become the object\nof hatred and envy of the poorer ones: and the latter, rightly or\nwrongly, would all be convinced that their position could be\nimproved much more quickly if they were only free to do what\nthey wished. Indeed, if it comes to be regarded as the duty of\nthe international authority to bring about distributive justice"

    "raw_text": "232 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nbetween the different peoples, it is no more than a consistent\nand inevitable development of socialist doctrine that class strife\nwould become a struggle between the working classes of the\ndifferent countries.\nThere is at present a great deal of muddle-headed talk about\n\"planning to equalise standards of life\". It is instructive to con­\nsider in a little more detail one of these proposals to see what\nprecisely it involves. The area for which at the present moment\nour planners are particularly fond of drawing up such schemes is\nthe Danube Basin and South-Eastern Europe. There can be no\ndoubt about the urgent need for amelioration of economic con­\nditions in this region, from humanitarian and economic con­\nsiderations as well as in the interest of the future peace of\nEurope, nor that this can be achieved only in a political setting\ndifferent from that of the past. But this is not the same thing as to\nwish to see economic life in this region to be directed according\nto a single master plan, to foster the development of the different\nindustries according to a schedule laid down beforehand in a\nway which makes the success of local initiative dependent on\nbeing approved by the central authority and being incorporated\nin its plan. One cannot, for example, create a kind of \"Tennessee\nValley Authority\" for the Danube Basin without thereby deter­\nmining beforehand for many years to come the relative rate of\nprogress of the different races inhabiting this area, or without\nsubordinating all their individual aspirations and wishes to this\ntask.\nPlanning of this kind must of necessity begin by fixing an\norder of priorities of the different claims. To plan for the deliber­\nate equalisation of standards of living means that the different\nclaims must be ranked according to merit, that some must be\ngiven precedence over others, and that the latter must wait their\nturn-even though those whose interests are thus relegated may\nbe convinced, not only of their better right, but also of their\nability to reach their goal sooner if they were only given\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 233\nfreedom to act on their own devices. There exists no basis which\nallows us to decide whether the claims of the poor Rumanian\npeasant are more or less urgent than those of the still poorer\nAlbanian, or the needs of the Slovakian mountain shepherd\ngreater than those of his Slovenian colleague. But if the raising of\ntheir standards of life is to be effected according to a unitary\nplan, somebody must deliberately balance the merits of all these\nclaims and decide between them. And once such a plan is put\ninto execution, all the resources of the planned area must serve\nthat plan-there can be no exemption for those who feel they\ncould do better for themselves. Once their claim has been given a\nlower rank, they will have to work for the prior satisfaction of\nthe needs of those who have been given preference. In such a\nstate of affairs everybodywill rightly feel that he is worse off than\nhe might be if some other plan had been adopted, and that it is\nthe decision and the might of the dominant powers which have\ncondemned him to a place less favourable than he thinks is due\nto him. To attempt such a thing in a region peopled by small\nnations, each of which believes equally fervently in its own\nsuperiority over the others, is to undertake a task which can be\nperformed only by the use of force. What it would amount to in\npractice is that British decisions and British power would have to\nsettle whether the standards of the Macedonian or the Bulgarian\npeasant should be raised faster, whether the Czech or the Hun­\ngarian miner should more rapidly approach Western standards.\nIt does not need much knowledge of human nature, and cer­\ntainly only a little knowledge of the people of Central Europe, to\nsee that whatever the decision imposed, there will be many,\nprobably a majority, to whom the particular order chosen will\nappear supreme injustice, and that their common hatred will\nsoon turn against the power which, however disinterestedly, in\nfact decides their fate.\nThough there are no doubt many people who honestly believe\nthat if they were allowed to handle the job they would be able to\n\f\n234 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nsettle all these problems justly and impartially, and who would\nbe genuinely surprised to find suspicion and hatred turning\nagainst them, they would probably be the first to apply force\nwhen those whom they mean to benefit prove recalcitrant, and\nto show themselves quite ruthless in coercing people in what is\npresumed to be their own interests. What these dangerous ideal­\nists do not see is that where the assumption of a moral responsi­\nbility involves that one's moral views should by force be made to\nprevail over those dominant in other communities, the assump­\ntion of such responsibility may place one in a position in which\nit becomes impossible to act morally. To impose such an impos­\nsible moral task on the victorious nations is a certain way\nmorally to corrupt and discredit them.\nBy all means let us assist the poorer people as much as we can\nin their own efforts to build up their lives and to raise their\nstandards of living. An international authority can be very just\nand contribute enormously to economic prosperity if it merely\nkeeps order and creates conditions in which the people can\ndevelop their own life; but it is impossible to be just or to let\npeople live their own life if the central authority doles out raw\nmaterials and allocates markets, if every spontaneous effort has\nto be \"approved\" and nothing can be done without the sanction\nof the central authority.\n* * * * *\nAfter the discussions in earlier chapters it is hardly necessary to\nstress that these difficulties cannot be met by conferring on the\nvarious international authorities \"merely\" specific economic\npowers. The belief that this is a practical solution rests on the\nfallacy that economic planning is merely a technical task, which\ncan be solved in a strictly objective manner by experts, and that the\nreally vital things would still be left in the hands of the political\nauthorities.

The controller of the supply of any such raw material\nas petrol or timber, rubber or tin, would be the master of the fate\nof whole industries and countries. In deciding whether to allow\nthe supply to increase and the price or the income of the pro­\nducers to fall, he would decide whether some country is to be\nallowed to start some new industry or whether it is to be pre­\ncluded from doing so. While he \"protects\" the standards of life\nof those he regards as specially entrusted to his care, he will\ndeprive many who are in a much worse position of their best\nand perhaps only chance to improve it.

The same is true of international arrangement\nfor \"sharing\" of markets and even more so of the control of\ninvestment and the development of natural resources.\nIt is curious to observe how those who pose as the most\nhardboiled realists, and who lose no opportunity of casting ridi­\ncule on the \"utopianism\" of those who believe in the possibility\nof an international political order, yet regard as more practicable\nthe much more intimate and irresponsible interference with the\nlives of the different peoples which economic planning involves;\nand believe that, once hitherto undreamed-of power is given to\nan international government, which has just been represented as\nnot even capable of enforcing a simple Rule of Law, this greater\npower will be used in so unselfish and so obviously just a man­\nner as to command general consent. If anything is evident it\nshould be that, while nations might abide by formal rules on\nwhich they have agreed, they will never submit to the direction\nwhich international economic planning involves-that while\nthey may agree on the rules of the game, they will never agree on\nthe order of preference in which the rank of their own needs and\nthe rate at which they are allowed to advance is fixed by majority\nvote. Even if, at first, the peoples should, under some illusion\nabout the meaning of such proposals, agree to transfer such\npowers to an international authority, they would soon find out\nthat what they have delegated is not merely a technical task, but\nthe most comprehensive power over their very lives.\nWhat is evidently at the back of the minds of the not\naltogether unpracticable \"realists\" who advocate these schemes\nis that, while the great Powers will be unwilling to submit to any\nsuperior authority, they will be able to use those \"international\"\nauthorities to impose their will on the smaller nations within the\narea in which they exercise hegemony.

This\ndisguise would, however, not alter the fact that for all the smaller\nstates it would mean a much more complete subjection to an\nexternal power, to which no real resistance would any longer be\npossible, than would be involved in the renunciation of a clearly\ndefined part of political sovereignty.\nIt is significant that the most passionate advocates of a centrally\ndirected economic New Order for Europe should display, like\ntheir Fabian and German prototypes, the most complete dis­\nregard of the individuality and of the rights of small nations. The\nviews of Professor Carr, who in this sphere even more than in that\nof internal policy is representative of the trend towards totali­\ntarianism in this country, have already made one of his profes­\nsional colleagues ask the very pertinent question: \"If the Nazi\nway with small sovereign states is indeed to become the common\nform, what is the war about?\"! Those who have observed how\nmuch disquiet and alarm some recent utterances on these ques­\ntions in papers as different as The Times and the New Statesman2 have\ncaused among our smaller Allies will have little doubt how much\nthis attitude is even now resented among our closest friends, and\nhow easy it will be to dissipate the stock of goodwill which has\nbeen laid up during the war if these advisers are followed.\n* * * * *\nThose who are so ready to ride roughshod over the rights of\nsmall states are, of course, right in one thing: we cannot hope for\nI Professor C. A. W Manning, in a review of Professor Carr's Conditionsof Peace in\nthe International Affairs Review Supplement, June 1942.\n2 It is significant in more than one respect that, as was recently observed in one\nof the weekly journals, \"one had already begun to expect a touch of the Carr\nflavour in the New Statesmanpages as well as in those of The Times\" (\"Four Winds\"\nin Time and Tide, February 20, 1943).\n\f\n238 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\norder or lasting peace after this war if states, large or small,\nregain unfettered sovereignty in the economic sphere. But this\ndoes not mean that a new super-state must be given powers\nwhich we have not learnt to use intelligently even on a national\nscale, that an international authority ought to be given power to\ndirect individual nations how to use their resources. It means\nmerely that there must be a power which can restrain the dif­\nferent nations from action harmful to their neighbours, a set\nof rules which defines what a state may do, and an authority\ncapable of enforcing these rules. The powers which such an\nauthority would need are mainly of a negative kind: it must\nabove all be able to say \"no\" to all sorts of restrictive measures.\nFar from its being true that, as is now widely believed, we\nneed an international economic authority while the states can at\nthe same time retain their unrestricted political sovereignty,\nalmost exactly the opposite is true. What we need and can hope\nto achieve is not more power in the hands of irresponsible inter­\nnational economic authorities, but, on the contrary, a superior\npolitical power which can hold the economic interests in check,\nand in the conflict between them can truly hold the scales,\nbecause it is itself not mixed up in the economic game. The need\nis for an international political authority which, without power\nto direct the different people what they must do, must be able to\nrestrain them from action which will damage others. The powers\nwhich must devolve on an international authority are not the\nnew powers assumed by the states in recent times, but that\nminimum of powers without which it is impossible to preserve\npeaceful relationships, Le. essentially the powers of the ultra­\nliberal \"laissez-faire\"state. And even more than in the national\nsphere, it is essential that these powers of the international\nauthority should be strictly circumscribed by the Rule of Law.\nThe need for such a super-national authority becomes indeed\ngreater as the individual states more and more become units of\neconomic administration, the actors rather than merely the\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 239\nsupervisors of the economic scene, and as therefore any friction\nis likely to arise not between individuals but between states as\nsuch.\nThe form of international government under which certain\nstrictly defined powers are transferred to an international author­\nity, while in all other respects the individual countries remain\nresponsible for their internal affairs, is, of course, that of feder­\nation. We must not allow the numerous ill-considered and often\nextremely silly claims made on behalf of a federal organisation\nof the whole world during the height of the propaganda for\n\"Federal Union\" to obscure the fact that the principle of feder­\nation is the only form of association of different peoples which\nwill create an international order without putting an undue\nstrain on their legitimate desire for independence. 1 Federalism\nis, of course, nothing but the application to international affairs\nof democracy, the only method of peaceful change man has yet\ninvented. But it is a democracy with definitely limited powers.\nApart from the more impracticable ideal of fusing different\ncountries into a single centralised state (the desirability of which\nis far from obvious) it is the only way in which the ideal of\ninternational law can be made a reality. We must not deceive\nourselves that in calling in the past the rules of international\nbehaviour international law we were doing more than express­\ning a pious wish. When we want to prevent people from killing\neach other we are not content to issue a declaration that killing is\nundesirable, but we give an authority power to prevent it. In the\nsame way there can be no international law without a power to\nenforce it. The obstacle to the creation of such an international\n1 It is a great pity that the flood of federalist publications which in recent years\nhas descended upon us has deprived the few important and thoughtful works\namong them of the attention they deserved. One which in particular ought to\nbe carefully consulted when the time comes for the framing of a new political\nstructure of Europe is Dr. W Ivor Jennings's small book on A Federationfor Western\nEurope (1940).\n\f\n240 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\npower was very largely the idea that it need command all the\npractically unlimited powers which the modern state possesses.\nBut with the division of power under the federal system this is\nby no means necessary.\nThis division of power would inevitably act at the same time\nalso as a limitation of the power of the whole as well as of the\nindividual state. Indeed many of the kinds of planning which are\nnow fashionable would probably become altogether impos­\nsible.1 But it would by no means constitute an obstacle to all\nplanning. It is, in fact, one of the main advantages of federation\nthat it can be so devised as to make most of the harmful planning\ndifficult while leaving the way free for all desirable planning. It\nprevents, or can be made to prevent, most forms of restriction­\nism. And it confines international planning to the fields where\ntrue agreement can be reached-not only between the \"inter­\nests\" immediately concerned, but among all those affected. The\ndesirable forms of planning which can be effected locally and\nwithout the need of restrictive measures, are left free and in the\nhands of those best qualified to undertake it. It is even to be\nhoped that within a federation, where there will no longer exist\nthe same reasons for making the individual states as strong as\npossible, the process of centralisation of the past may in some\nmeasure be reversed and some devolution of powers from the\nstate to the local authorities become possible.\nIt is worth recalling that the idea of the world at last finding\npeace through the absorption of the separate states in large fed­\nerated groups and ultimately perhaps in one single federation,\nfar from being new, was indeed the ideal of almost all the liberal\nthinkers of the nineteenth century. From Tennyson, whose much\nquoted vision of the \"battle of the air\" is followed by a vision of\nthe federation of the people which will follow their last great\n1 See on this the author's article on \"Economic Conditions of Inter-State\nFederation\", The New CommonwealthQuarterly,vol. V, September 1939.\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 241\nfight, right down to the end of the century the final achievement\nof a federal organisation remained the ever-recurring hope of a\nnext great step in the advance of civilisation. Nineteenth-century\nliberals may not have been fully aware how essential a comple­\nment of their principles a federal organisation of the different\nstates formed 1; but there were few among them who did\nnot express their belief in it as an ultimate goal.2 It was only\nwith the approach of our twentieth century that before the\ntriumphant rise of Realpolitikthese hopes came to be regarded as\nunpracticable and utopian.\n* * * * *\nWe shall not rebuild civilisation on the large scale. It is no acci­\ndent that on the whole there was more beauty and decency to be\nfound in the life of the small peoples, and that among the large\nones there was more happiness and content in proportion as\nthey had avoided the deadly blight of centralisation. Least of all\nshall we preserve democracy or foster its growth if all the power\nand most of the important decisions rest with an organisation\nfar too big for the common man to surveyor comprehend.\nNowhere has democracy ever worked well without a great\nmeasure of local self-government, providing a school of political\ntraining for the people at large as much as for their future\nleaders. It is only where responsibility can be learnt and prac­\ntised in affairs with which most people are familiar, where it is\nthe awareness of one's neighbour rather than some theoretical\nknowledge of the needs of other people which guides action,\n1 See on this Professor Robbins's already quoted book, pp. 240-57.\n2 As late as the closing years of the nineteenth century Henry Sidgwick\nthought it \"not beyond the limits of a sober forecast to conjecture that some\nfuture integration may take place in the West European states: and if it should\ntake place, it seems probable that the example of America will be followed, and\nthat the new political aggregate will be formed on the basis of a federal polity\"\n(The Developmentof European Polity, published posthumously in 1903, p. 439).\n\f\n242 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nthat the ordinary man can take a real part in public affairs\nbecause they concern the world he knows. Where the scope of\nthe political measures becomes so large that the necessary know­\nledge is almost exclusively possessed by the bureaucracy, the\ncreative impulses of the private person must flag. I believe that\nhere the experience of the small countries like Holland and\nSwitzerland contains much from which even the most fortunate\nlarger countries like Great Britain can learn. We shall all be the\ngainers if we can create a world fit for small states to live in.\nBut the small can preserve their independence in the inter­\nnational as in the national sphere only within a true system of\nlaw which guarantees both that certain rules are invariably\nenforced and that the authority which has the power to enforce\nthese cannot use it for any other purpose. While for its task of\nenforcing the common law the super-national authority must be\nvery powerful, its constitution must at the same time be so\ndesigned that it prevents the international as well as the national\nauthorities from becoming tyrannical. We shall never prevent\nthe abuse of power if we are not prepared to limit power in a\nway which occasionally may also prevent its use for desirable\npurposes. The great opportunity we shall have at the end of this\nwar is that the great victorious powers, by themselves first sub­\nmitting to a system of rules which they have the power to\nenforce, may at the same time acquire the moral right to impose\nthe same rules upon others.\nAn international authority which effectively limits the powers\nof the state over the individual will be one of the best safeguards\nof peace. The international Rule of Law must become a safeguard\nas much against the tyranny of the state over the individual as\nagainst the tyranny of the new super-state over the national\ncommunities. Neither an omnipotent super-state, nor a loose\nassociation of \"free nations\" , but a community of nations of free\nmen must be our goal. We have long pleaded that it had become\nimpossible to behave in international affairs as we thought it\n\f\nTHE PROSPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER 243\ndesirable because others would not play the game. The coming\nsettlement will be the opportunity to show that we have been\nsincere and that we are prepared to accept the same restrictions\non our freedom of action which in the common interest we\nthink it necessary to impose upon others.\nWisely used, the federal principle of organisation may indeed\nprove the best solution of some of the world's most difficult\nproblems. But its application is a task of extreme difficulty and\nwe are not likely to succeed if in an over-ambitious attempt we\nstrain it beyond its capacity. There will probably exist a strong\ntendency to make any new international organisation all­\ncomprehensive and world-wide; and there will, of course, be an\nimperative need for some such comprehensive organisation,\nsome new League of Nations. The great danger is that, if in the\nattempt to rely exclusively on this world organisation it is\ncharged with all the tasks which it seems desirable to place in the\nhands of an international organisation, they will not in fact be\nadequately performed. It has always been my conviction that\nsuch ambitions were at the root of the weakness of the League of\nNations: that in the (unsuccessful) attempt to make it world­\nwide it had to be made weak, and that a smaller and at the same\ntime more powerful League might have been a better instrument\nto preserve peace. I believe that these considerations still hold\nand that a degree of co-operation could be achieved between,\nsay, the British Empire and the nations of Western Europe and\nprobably the United States which would not be possible on a\nworld scale. The comparatively close association which a Federal\nUnion represents will not at first be practicable beyond perhaps\neven as narrow a region as part of Western Europe, though it\nmay be possible gradually to extend it.\nIt is true that with the formation of such regional federations\nthe possibility of war between the different blocs still remains,\nand that to reduce this risk as much as possible we must rely on a\nlarger and looser association. My point is that the need for some\n\f\n244 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM\nsuch other organisation should not form an obstacle to a closer\nassociation of those countries which are more similar in their\ncivilisation, outlook, and standards. While we must aim at pre­\nventing future wars as much as possible, we must not believe\nthat we can at one stroke create a permanent organisation which\nwill make all war in any part of the world entirely impossible.\nWe should not only not succeed in such an attempt, but we\nshould thereby probably spoil our chances of achieving success\nin a more limited sphere. As is true with respect to other great\nevils, the measures by which war might be made altogether\nimpossible for the future may well be worse than even war itself\nIf we can reduce the risk of friction likely to lead to war, this is\nprobably all we can reasonably hope to achieve.\n\f\nCONCLUSION\nThe purpose of this book has not been to sketch a detailed\nprogramme of a desirable future order of society. If with regard\nto international affairs we have gone a little beyond its essentially\ncritical task, it was because in this field we may soon be called\nupon to create a framework within which future growth may\nhave to proceed for a long time to come. A great deal will\ndepend on how we use the opportunity we shall then have. But\nwhatever we do, it can only be the beginning of a new, long, and\narduous process in which we all hope we shall gradually create a\nworld very different from that which we knew during the last\nquarter of a century. It is at least doubtful whether at this stage a\ndetailed blueprint of a desirable internal order of society would\nbe of much use-or whether anyone is competent to furnish it.\nThe important thing now is that we shall come to agree on\ncertain principles and free ourselves from some of the errors\nwhich have governed us in the recent past. However distasteful\nsuch an admission may be, we must recognise that we had\nbefore this war once again reached a stage where it is more\n\f\n246 CONCLUSION\nimportant to clear away the obstacles with which human folly\nhas encumbered our path and to release the creative energy of\nindividuals than to devise further machinery for \"guiding\" and\n\"directing\" them-to create conditions favourable to progress\nrather than to \"plan progress\". The first need is to free ourselves\nof that worst form of contemporary obscurantism which tries to\npersuade us that what we have done in the recent past was all\neither wise or inevitable. We shall not grow wiser before we\nlearn that much that we have done was very foolish.\nIf we are to build a better world we must have the courage to\nmake a new start-even if that means some reculerpour mieuxsauter.\nIt is not those who believe in inevitable tendencies who show this\ncourage, not those who preach a \"New Order\" which is no more\nthan a projection of the tendencies of the last forty years, and\nwho can think of nothing better than to imitate Hitler. It is\nindeed those who cry loudest for the New Order who are most\ncompletely under the sway of the ideas which have created this\nwar and most of the evils from which we suffer. The young are\nright if they have little confidence in the ideas which rule most of\ntheir elders. But they are mistaken or misled when they believe\nthat these are still the liberal ideas of the nineteenth century,\nwhich in fact the younger generation hardly knows. Though we\nneither can wish, nor possess the power, to go back to the reality\nof the nineteenth century, we have the opportunity to realise its\nideals-and they were not mean. We have little right to feel in\nthis respect superior to our grandfathers; and we should never\nforget that it is we, the twentieth century, and not they, who have\nmade a mess of things. If they had not yet fully learnt what was\nnecessary to create the world they wanted, the experience we\nhave since gained ought to have equipped us better for the task. If\nin the first attempt to create a world of free men we have failed,\nwe must try again. The guiding principle, that a policy of free­\ndom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy,\nremains as true to-day as it was in the nineteenth century.\n\f\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\nThe exposition of a point of view which for many years has been decidedly\nout of favour suffers from the difficultythat, within the compass of a few\nchapters, it is not possible to discuss more than some aspects of it. For the\nreader whose outlook has been formed entirely by the views that have been\ndominant during the last twenty years this will scarcely be sufficient to\nprovide the common ground required for profitable discussion. But\nalthough unfashionable, the views of the author of the present book are\nnot so singular as they may appear to some readers. His basic outlook is\nthe same as that of a steadily growing number of writers in many countries\nwhose studies have led them independently to similar conclusions. The\nreader who would like to acquaint himself further with what he may have\nfound an unfamiliar but not uncongenial climate of opinion, may find\nuseful the following list of some of the more important works of this kind,\nincluding several in which the essentially critical character of the present\nessay is supplemented by a fuller discussion of the structure of a desirable\nfuture society.\nW.
