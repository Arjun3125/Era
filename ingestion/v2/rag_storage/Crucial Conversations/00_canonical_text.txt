PRAISE FOR CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
"Relationships are the priority of life, and conversations are the 
crucial element in profound caring of relationships. This book 
helps us to think about what we really want to say. If you want 
to succeed in both talking and listening, read this book." 
-Dr . Lloyd J. Ogilvie, chaplain, United States Senate 
"Important, lucid, and practical, Crucial Conversations is a 
book that will make a difference in your life. Learn how to flour­
ish in every difficult situation." 
-Robert E. Quinn, ME Tracy Collegiate Professor of 
OBHRM, University of Michigan Business School 
"I was personally and professionally inspired by this book-and 
I'm not easily impressed. In the fast-paced world of IT, the success 
of our systems, and our business, depends on crucial conversations 
we have every day. Unfortunately, because our environment is so 
technical, far too often we forget about the 'human systems' that 
make or break us. These skills are the missing foundation piece." 
-Maureen Burke, manager of training, 
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. 
"The book is compelling. Yes, I found myself in too many of their 
examples of what not to do when caught in these worst-of-all­
worlds situations! GET THIS BOOK, WHIP OUT A PEN AND 
GET READ Y TO SCRIBBLE MARGIN NOTES FURIOUSLY, 
AND PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE THE INVALUABLE 
TOOLS THESE AUTHORS PRESENT. I know I did-and it 
helped me salvage several difficult situations and repair my 
damaged self-esteem in others. I will need another copy pretty 
soon. as I'm wearing out the pages in this one!" 
-James Belasco. best-sell ing author of Flight of the Buffalo, 
l!l1trl!prl!l1eur. professor. und l!xl!cutive director of the Financial 
Tilllrs Knowkdgc Diuloguc "Crucial Conversations is the most useful self-help book I have 
ever read. I'm awed by how insightful, readable, well organized, 
and focused it is. I keep thinking: 'If only I had been exposed to 
these dialogue skills 30 years ago ... ' " 
-John Hatch, founder, FINCA International 
"One of the greatest tragedies is seeing someone with incredible 
talent get derailed because he or she lacks some basic skills. 
Crucial Conversations addresses the number one reason execu­
tives derail, and it provides extremely helpful tools to operate in 
a fast-paced, results-oriented enviro nment." 
-Karie A. Willyerd, chief talent officer, Solectron 
"The book prescribes, with structure and wit, a way to improve on 
the most fundamental element of organizational learning and 
growth-honest, unencumbered dialogue between individuals. 
There are one or two of the many leadership/management 
'thought' books on my shelf that are frayed and dog-eared from 
use. Crucial Conversations will no doubt end up in the same con­
dition."

INDEX 231 Foreword 
This is a breakthrough book. That is exactly how I saw it when 
I first read the manuscript. I so resonated with the importance, 
power, and timeliness of its message that I even suggested to the 
authors that they title it "Break through Conversati ons ." But as I 
read deeper, listened to the tapes, and experienced the insight 
borne of years of experience with this material, I came to under­
stand why it is titled Crucial Conversations. 
From my own work with organizations, including families, 
and from my own experience, I have come to see that there are 
a few defining moments in our lives and careers that make all 
the difference. Many of these defining moments come from 
"crucial" or "breakthrough" conver sations with important peo­
ple in emotionally charged situations where the decisions made 
take us down one of several roads, each of which leads to an 
entirely different destination. 
I can see the wisdom in the assertion of the great historian 
Arnold Toynbee, who said that you can pretty well summarize all 
of history-not only of society, but of institutions and of people­
in four words: Nothing fails like success. In other words, when 
a challenge in life is met by a response that is equal to it, you 
have success. But when the challenge moves to a higher level, 
the old, once successful response no longer works-it fails; 
thus, nothing fails like success. XII FOREWORD 
The challenge has noticeably changed for our lives, our fami­
lies, and our organization s. Just as the world is changing at 
frightening speed and has become increasingly and profoundly 
interdependent with marvelous and dangerous technologies, so, 
too, have the stresses and pressures we all experience exponen­
tially increased. This charged atmosphere makes it all the more 
imperative that we nourish our relationships and develop tools, 
skills, and enhanced capacity to find new and better solutions to 
our problems. 
These newer, better solutions will not represent "my way" or 
"your way"-they will represent "our way." In short, the solu­
tions must be synergistic, meaning that the whole is greater than 
the sum of the parts. Such synergy may manifest itself in a bet­
ter decision, a better relationship , a better decision-making 
process, increased commitment to implement decisions made, 
or a combination of two or more of these. 
What you learn is that "crucial conve rsations" transform peo­
ple and relationships. They are anything but transacted; they 
create an entirely new level of bonding. They produce what 
Buddhism calls "the middle way" -not a compromise between 
two opposites on a straight-line continuum, but a higher middle 
way, like the apex of a triangle. Because two or more people 
have created something new from genuine dialogue, bonding 
takes place-just like the bonding that takes place in family or 
marriage when a new child is created. When you produce some­
thing with another person that is truly creative, it's one of the 
most powerful forms of bonding there is. In fact the bonding is 
so strong that you simply would not be disloyal in his or her 
absence, even if there were social pressure to join others in bad­
mouthing. 
The sequential development of the subject matter in this book 
is brilliant. It moves you from understanding the supernal power FOREWORD XIII 
of dialogue, to clarifying what you really want to have happen and 
focusing on what actually is happening, to creating conditions of 
safety, to using self-awareness and self-knowledge. And finally, it 
moves you to learning how to achieve such a level of mutual 
understanding and creative synergy that people are emotionally 
connected to the conclusions reached and are emotionally willing 
and committed to effectively implementing them. In short, you 
move from creating the right mind- and heart-set to developing 
and utilizing the right skill-set. 
In spite of the fact that I have spent many years writing and 
teaching similar ideas, I found myself being deeply influenced, 
motivated, and even inspired by this material-learning new ideas, 
going deeper into old ideas, seeing new applications, and broaden­
ing my understanding. I've also learned how these new techniques, 
skills, and tools work together in enabling crucial conversations 
that truly create a break with the mediocrity or mistakes of the 
past. Most breakthroughs in life truly are "break-withs." 
When I first put my hands on this book, I was delighted to see 
that dear friends and colleagues had drawn on their entire lives 
and professional experiences to not only address a tremendously 
important topic, but also to do it in a way that is so accessible, so 
fun, so full of humor and illustration, so full of common sense 
and practicality. They show how to effectively blend and use both 
intellectual (1.0.) and emotional intelligence (E.O.) to enable 
crucial conversatio ns. 
I remember one of the authors having a crucial convers ation 
with his professor in college. The professor felt that this student 
was neither paying the price in class nor living up to his potential. 
This student, my friend, listened carefully, restated the professor's 
concern, expressed appreciation for the professor's affirmation of 
his potentia l , and then smilingly and calmly said, "My focus is on XIV FOREWORD 
other priorities, and the class is just not that important to me at 
this time. I hope you can understand ." The teacher was taken 
aback, but then started to listen. A dialogue took place, new 
understanding was achieved, and the bonding was deepened. 
I know these authors to be outstanding individuals and 
remarkable teachers and consultants, and have even seen them 
work their magic in training seminars-but I didn't know if they 
could take this complex topic and fit it into a book. They did. I 
encourage you to really dig into this material, to pause and think 
deeply about each part and how the parts are sequenced. Then 
apply what you've learned, go back to the book again, learn 
some more, and apply your new learnin gs. Remember, to know 
and not to do is really not to know. 
I think you'll discover, as have I, that crucial conversatio ns, as 
powerfully described in this book, reflect the insight of this 
excerpt of Robert Frost's beaut iful and memorable poem, "The 
Road Not Taken": 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth; ... 
I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I­
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.

What's a Crucial 
Conversation? 
And Who Cares? 
When people first hear the term "crucial conversatio n," many 
conjure up images of presidents, emperors, and prime ministers 
seated around a massive table while they debate the future of the 
world. Although it's true that such discussions have a wide­
sweeping and lasting impact, they're not the kind we have in 
mind. The crucial conversations we're referring to in the title of 
this book are interactions that happen to everyone. They're the 
day-to-day conver sations that affect your life. 
Now, what makes one of your conversations crucial as opposed 
to plain vani lla? First, opinions vary. For example, you're talking 
with your boss about a possible promotion. She thinks you're 
not ready; you think you are. Second, stakes are high. You're in a meeting with four coworkers and you're trying to pick a new 
marketing strategy. You've got to do something different or your 
company isn't going to hit its annual goals. Third, emotions run 
strong. You're in the middle of a casual discussion with your 
spouse and he or she brings up an "ugly incident" that took place 
at yesterday's neighborhood block party. Apparently not only did 
you flirt with someone at the party, but according to your spouse, 
"You were practically making out." You don't remember flirting. 
You simply remember being polite and friendly. Your spouse 
walks off in a huff. 
And speaking of the block party, at one point you're making 
small talk with your somewhat crotchety and always colorful 
neighbor about his shrinking kidneys when he says, "Spe aking of 
the new fence you're building ... " From that moment on you 
end up in a heated debate over placing the new fence-three 
inches one way or the other. Three inches ! He finishes by threat­
ening you with a lawsuit, and you punctuate your points by men­
tioning that he's not completely aware of the difference between 
his hind part and his elbow. Emotions run really strong. 
What makes each of these conversations crucial-and not sim­
ply challenging, frustrating, frightening, or annoying-is that the 
results could have a huge impact on the quality of your life. In each 
case, some element of your daily routine could be forever altered 
for better or worse. Clearly a promotion could make a big differ­
ence. Your company's success affects you and everyone you work 
with. Your relationship with your spouse influences every aspect of 
your life. Even something as trivial as a debate over a property line 
affects how you get along with your neighbor. If you handle even a 
seemingly insignificant conversation poorly, you establish a pattern 
of behavior that shows up in all of your crucial conversations. 
By definition, crucial conversations are about tough issues. 
Unf ortunately, it's human nature to back away from discussions 
we fear will hurt us or make things worse. We're masters at avoid­
ing these tough convers ations. Coworkers send email to caI.:h other when they should walk down the hall and talk turkey. Bosses 
leave voice mail in lieu of meeting with their direct reports. Family 
members change the subject when an issue gets too risky. We (the 
authors) have a friend who learned through a voice-mail message 
that his wife was divorcing him. We use all kinds of tactics to 
dodge touchy issues. 
But it doesn't have to be this way. If you know how to handle 
(even master) crucial conversations, you can step up to and effec­
tively hold tough conversations about virtually any topic. 
Crucial Conversation (kroo shel kan'viir sa'shen) n 
A discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are 
high, (2) opinions vary, and (3) emotions run strong. 
HOW DO WE TYPICALLY HAN DLE CRUCIAL 
CONVE RSATIONS? 
Just because we're in the middle of a crucial conversation (or 
maybe thinking about stepping up to one) doesn't mean that 
we're in trouble or that we won't fare well. In truth, when we 
face crucial conver sations, we can do one of three things: 
• We can avoid them. 
• We can face them and handle them poorly. 
• We can face them and handle them well. 
That seems simple enough. Walk away from crucial conv ersa­
tions and suffer the consequences. Handle them poorly and suf­
fer the consequences. Or handle them well. 
"I don't know," you think to yourself. "Given the three choic­
es, I'll go with handling them well." 
We're on Our Worst Behavior 
But do we handle them w ell? When talking turns tough, do we 
pause, takc a deep brcuth, unnl.>uncc to our innerselves, "Uh-oh, 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
this discussion is crucial. I'd better pay close attention" and then 
trot out our best behavior? Or when we're anticipating a poten­
tially dangerous discussion, do we step up to it rather than scam­
per away? Sometimes. Sometimes we boldly step up to hot topics, 
monitor our behavior, and offer up our best work. We mind our 
Ps and Os. Sometimes we're just flat-out good. 
And then we have the rest of our lives. These are the moments 
when, for whatever reason, we either anticipate a crucial conver­
sation or are in the middle of one and we're at our absolute 
worst-we yell; we withdraw; we say things we later regret. When 
conversations matter the most-that is, when conversations move 
from casual to crucial-we're generally on our worst behavior. 
Why is that? 
We're designed wrong. When conversations tum from routine 
to crucial, we're often in trouble. That's because emotions don't 
exactly prepare us to conver se effectively. Countless generations 
of genetic shaping drive humans to handle crucial conver sations 
with flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent persuasion and gen­
tle attentivene ss. 
For instance, consider a typical crucial conversation. Someone 
says something you disagree with about a topic that matters a 
great deal to you and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 
The hairs you can ha ndle. Unf ortunately, your body does more. 
Two tiny organs seated neatly atop your kidneys pump adrenaline 
into your bloodstream. You don't choose to do this. Your adrenal 
glands do it, and then you have to live with it. 
And that's not all. Your brain then diverts blood from activi­
ties it deems nonessential to high-priority tasks such as hitting 
and running. Unf ortunate ly, as the large muscles of the arms 
and legs get more blood, the higher-level reasoning sections of 
your brain get less. As a result, you end up facing challenging 
conver sations with the same equipment available to a rhesus 
monkey. WHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 5 
We're under pressure. Let's add another factor. Crucial con­
versations are frequently spontaneous. More often than not, they 
come out of nowhere. And since you're caught by surprise, 
you're forced to conduct an extraordinarily complex human 
interaction in real time-no books, no coaches, and certainly no 
short breaks while a team of therapists runs to your aid and 
pumps you full of nifty ideas. 
What do you have to work with? The issue at hand, the other 
person, and a brain that's preparing to fight or take flight. It's lit­
tle wonder that we often say and do things that make perfect sense 
in the moment, but later on seem, well, stupid. 
"What was I thinking?" you wonder. 
The truth is, you were real-time multitasking with a brain that 
was working another job. You're lucky you didn't suffer a stroke. 
We're stumped. Now let's throw in one more complication. 
You don't know where to start. You're making this up as you go 
along because you haven't often seen real-life models of effec­
tive communication skills. Let's say that you actually planned 
for a tough conversation-maybe you've even mentally 
rehearsed. You feel prepared, and you're as cool as a cucumber. 
Will you succeed? Not necess arily. You can still screw up, 
because practice doesn't make perfect; perfect practice makes 
perfect. 
This means that first you have to know what to practice. 
Sometimes you don't. After all, you may have never actually seen 
how a certain problem is best handled. You may have seen what 
not to do-as modeled by a host of friends, colleagues, and, yes, 
even your parent s. In fact, you may have sworn time and again 
not to act the same way. 
Left with no healthy models, you're now more or less 
stumped. So what do you do? You do what most people do. You 
wing it. You piece together the words, create a certain mood, and 
otherwise make up what you think will work-all the while 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
multiprocessing with a half-starved brain. It's little wonder that 
when it matters the most, we're often at our worst behavior. 
We act in self-defeating ways. In our doped-up, dumbed-down 
state, the strategies we choose for dealing with our crucial con­
versations are perfectly designed to keep us from what we actu­
ally want. We're our own worst enemies-a nd we don't even 
realize it. Here's how this works. 
Let's say that your significant other has been paying less and 
less attention to you. You realize he or she has a busy job, but 
you still would like more time together. You drop a few hints 
about the issue, but your loved one doesn't handle it well. You 
decide not to put on added pressure, so you clam up. Of course, 
since you're not all that happy with the arrangement, your dis­
pleasure now comes out through an occasional sarcastic remark. 
"Another late night, huh? Do you really need all of the 
money in the world?" 
Unf ortunately (and here's where the problem becomes self­
defeating) , the more you snip and snap, the less your loved one 
wants to be around you. So your significant other spends even 
less time with you, you become even more upset, and the spi­
ral continue s. Your behavior is now actually creating the very 
thing you didn't want in the first place. You're caught in an 
unhealth y, self-defeating loop. 
Or consider what's happening with your roommate Terry­
who wears your and your other two roommates' clothes (without 
asking)-a nd he's proud of it. In fact, one day while walking out 
the door, he glibly announced that he was wearing something 
from each of your closets. You could see Taylor's pants, Scott's 
shirt, and, yes, even Chris's new matching shoes-and-socks 
ensemble. What of yours could he possibly be wearing? Eww! 
Your response, quite natur ally, has been to bad-mouth Terry 
behind his back. That is until one day when he overheard you WHATS A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 7 
belittling him to a friend, and you're now so embarrassed that you 
avoid being around him. Now when you're out of the apartment, 
he wears your clothes, eats your food, and uses your computer 
out of spite. 
Let's try another example. You share a cubicle with a four-star 
slob and you're a bit of a neat freak. In Odd Couple parlance, 
you're Felix and he's Oscar. Your coworker has left you notes 
written in grease pencil on your file cabinet, in catsup on the back 
of a french-fry bag, and in permanent marker on your desk blot­
ter. You, in contrast, leave him typed Post-it notes. Typed. 
At first you sort of tolerated each other. Then you began to get 
on each other's nerv es. You started nagging him about cleaning 
up. He started nagging you about your nagging. Now you're 
beginning to react to each other. Every time you nag, he becomes 
upset, and, well, let's say that he doesn't exactly clean up. Every 
time he calls you an "anal-retentive nann y," you vow not to give 
in to his vile and filthy ways. 
What has come from all this bickering? Now you're neater 
than ever, and your cubicle partner's half of the work area is 
about to be condemned by the health department . You're caught 
in a self-defeating loop. The more the two of you push each 
other, the more you create the very behaviors you both despise. 
Some Comm on Crucial Conversati ons 
In each of these examples of unhealthy self-perpetuation, the 
stakes were moderate to high, opinions varied, and emotions ran 
strong. Actually, to be honest, in a couple of the examples the 
stakes were fairly low at first, but with time and growing emo­
tions, the relationship eventually turned sour and quality of life 
suffered-making the risks high. 
These examples, of course, are merely the tip of an enormous 
and ugly iceberg of problems stemming from crucial conversations 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
that either have been avoided or have gone wrong. Other topics 
that could easily lead to disaster include 
• Ending a relationship 
• Talking to a coworker who behaves offensively or makes sugges­
tive comments 
• Asking a friend to repay a loan 
• Giving the boss feedback about her behavior 
• Approaching a boss who is breaking his own safety or quality 
policies 
• Critiquing a colleague's work 
• Asking a roommate to move out 
• Resolving custody or visitation issues with an ex-spouse 
• Dealing with a rebellious teen 
• Talking to a team member who isn't keeping commitments 
• Discussi ng problems with sexual intimacy 
• Confronting a loved one about a subs tance abuse problem 
• Talking to a colleague who is hoarding infonnation or resources 
• Giving an unfavorab le performance review 
• Asking in-laws to quit interfering 
• Talking to a coworker about a personal hygiene problem 
OUR AUDACIOUS CLAIM 
Let's say that either you avoid tough issues or when you do bring 
them up, you're on your worst behavior. What's the big deal? 
How high are the stakes anyway? Do the consequences of a 
fouled-up conversation extend beyond the conversation itself? 
Should you worry? WHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 9 
Actually, the effects of conversations gone bad can be both 
devastating and far reaching. Our research has shown that strong 
relationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw 
from the same source of power-the ability to talk openly about 
high-stakes, emotional, controversial topics. 
So here's the audacious claim. Master your crucial conver sa­
tions and you'll kick-start your career, strengthen your relation­
ships, and improve your health. As you and others master high­
stakes discussions, you'll also vitalize your organization and your 
community. 
Kick-Start Your Career 
Could the ability to master crucial conversations help your career? 
Absolutely. Twenty-five years of research with twenty thousand 
people and hundreds of organizations has taught us that individu­
als who are the most influential-who can get things done, and at 
the same time build on relationships-a re those who master their 
crucial conversations. 
For instance, high performers know how to stand up to the 
boss without committing career suicide. We've all seen people 
hurt their careers over tough issues. You may have done it your­
self. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you 
finally speak out-but a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an 
issue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget them­
selves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you 
decide to say something. It's not a pretty discuss ion-but some­
body has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something 
stupid. (Gulp .) 
As it turns out, you don't have to choose between being hon­
est and being effective. You don't have to choose between candor 
and your career. People who routinely hold crucial conversations 
and hold them well are able to express controversial and even 10 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
risky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and 
direct reports listen without becoming defensive or angry. 
What about your career? Are there crucial conver sations that 
you're not holding or not holding well? Is this undermining your 
influence? And more important ly, would your career take a step 
forward if you could improve how you're dealing with these 
conversations? 
Impr ove Your Organization 
Okay, so individu al careers may sink or swim based on crucial 
conver sations, but how about organizations? Surely a soft-and­
gushy factor such as how you talk to one another doesn't have an 
impact on the not so soft-and-gushy bottom line. 
For twenty-five years we (the authors) explored this very issue. 
We (and hundreds of others) searched for keys to organizational 
success. Most of us studying the elusive topic figured that some­
thing as large as a company's overall success would depend on 
something as large as a company's strategy, structure, or systems. 
After all, organizations that maintain best-in-class productivity 
rely on elegant performance-management systems. Widespread 
productivity couldn't result from anything less, could it? We 
weren't alone in our thinking. Every organization that attempted 
to bring about improvements-at least the companies we had 
heard of-began by revamping their performance-management 
systems. 
Then we actually studied those who had invested heavily in 
spiffy new performance-management systems. It turns out that 
we were dead wrong. Changing structures and systems alone did 
little to improve performance. For example, one study of five 
hundred stunningly productive organizations revealed that peak 
performance had absolutely nothing to do with forms, pro­
cedures, and policies that drive performance management. In WHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 11 
fact, half of the highflyers had almost no formal performance­
management processes.! 
What's behind their success? It all comes down to how people 
handle crucial conve rsations. Within high-performing com­
panies, when employees fail to deliver on their promises, col­
leagues willingly and effectively step in to discuss the problem. 
In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and 
then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with 
problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else 
accountable-regardless of level or position. The path to high 
productivity passes not through a static system, but through 
face-to-face conversations at all levels. 
Solve pressing problems. The best companies in almost any 
critical area are the ones that have developed the skills for deal­
ing effectively with conver sations that relate to that specific 
topic. For example: 
• Safety. When someone violates a procedure or otherwise acts 
in an unsafe way, the first person to see the problem, regard­
less of his or her position, steps up and holds a crucial con­
versation. 
• Productivity. If an employee underperforms, fails to live up to 
a promise, doesn't carry his or her fair share, or simply isn't 
productive enough, the affected parties address the problem 
immediately. 
• Diversity. When someone feels offended, threatened, insulted, 
or harassed, he or she skillfully and comfortably, discusses the 
issue with the offending party. 
• Quality. In companies where quality rules, people discuss 
problems face-to-face when they first come up. 
• Ellery other hot topic. Companies that are best-in-class in inno­
vation. teamwork, change man agement, or any other area that 12 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
calls for human interaction are best-in-class in holding the rel­
evant crucial conversations. 
What's the relationship between success in a key area and crucial 
conversations? Companies that make impressive improvements 
in key performance areas (and eventually master them) are gen­
erally no different than others in their efforts to improve . They 
conduct the same awareness training, print the same banne rs, 
and make the same speeches. They differ in what happens when 
someone does something wrong. Rather than waiting for a poli­
cy to kick in or a leader to take charge, people step up, speak up, 
and thrive. Equally important, if it's a leader who seems to be out 
of line, employees willingly speak up, the problem is solved, and 
the company moves on. 
So what about you? Is your organization stuck in its progress 
toward some important goal? If so, are there conversations that 
you're either avoiding or botching? And how about the people 
you work with? Are they stepping up to or walking away from 
crucial conver sations? Could you take a big step forward by 
improving how you deal with these conversations? 
Imp rove Your Relationship s 
Consider the impact crucial conve rsations can have on your 
relationship s. Could failed crucial conver sations lead to failed 
relationshi ps? As it turns out, when you ask the average person 
what causes couples to break up, he or she usually suggests that 
it's due to differences of opinion. You know, people have differ­
ent theories about how to manage their finan ces, spice up their 
love lives, or rear their children. In truth, everyone argues about 
important issues. But not everyone splits up. It's how you argue 
that matters. 
For example, when Clifford Notarius and Howard Markman 
(two noted marriage scholars) examined couples in the throes of WHAfS A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 13 
heated discussions, they learned that people fall into three cate­
gories-those who digress into threats and name-calling, those 
who revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, hon­
estly, and effectively. 
Mter watching dozens of couples, the two scholars predicted 
relationship outcomes and tracked their research subjects' rela­
tionships for the next ten years. Sure enough, they had predicted 
nearly 90 percent of the divorces that occurred.2 Over time, cou­
ples who found a way to state their opinions about high-stakes, 
controversial, and emotional issues honestly and respectfully 
remained together. Those who didn't, split up. 
Now, what about you? Think of your own important relation­
ships. Are there a few crucial conversations that you're current­
ly avoiding or handling poorly? Do you walk away from some 
issues only to come charging back into others? Do you hold in 
ugly opinions only to have them tumble out as sarcastic remarks 
or cheap shots? How about your significant other or family 
members? Are they constantly toggling from seething silence to 
subtle but costly attacks? When it matters the most (after all, 
these are your cherished loved ones), are you on your worst 
behavior? If so, you definitely have something to gain by learn­
ing more about how to handle crucial conversations. 
Revita lize Your Commun ity 
Next, let's look at our neighborhoods and communities. If the fate 
of an organization is largely determined by how pivotal conver­
sations are habitually handled, why should the communities that 
surround them be any different? The truth is, they aren't. 
The difference between the best communi ties and the good or 
the worst is not the number of problems they have. All commu­
nities face problems. Once again, the difference lies in how they 
deal with problems. In the best communities, key indiv iduals 14 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
and groups find a way to engage in healthy dialogue. They talk 
through important issues. In contr ast, communities that fail to 
improve play costly games. During community meetings peo­
ple insult one another, become indignant, and act as if indi­
viduals with differing views are sick or deranged. Battles 
ensue. 
In addition to how people behave in public forums, private 
behavior affects community health as well. Take, for example, 
the problem of crime. You might be shocked to discover a rather 
tragic statistic. Not everyone in prison is a career criminal who 
was born into a horrible family, then shaped by abuse and neg­
lect into a seething sociopath. In fact, over half of the people 
who are convicted of violent crimes are first-time offenders who 
commit crimes against friends or loved ones. 3 
How could this be? Violence is often preceded by prolonged 
periods of silence. Most inmates once held a job, paid their 
bills, and remembered their friends' birthdays. Then one day , 
after allowing unresolved problems to build up and then boil 
over, they attacked a friend, loved one, or neighbor. That's 
right, convicted first-time offenders are often not career crimi­
nals . They're our frustrated neighbors. Since they don't know 
what to say or how to say it, they opt for force. In this case, the 
inability to work through tough issues devastates individ uals, 
ruins families, and poisons communities. 
What about where you live? What crucial issues does your 
community face? Are there conversations that people are not 
holding or not holding well that keep you from progress? Is 
crime skyrocketing? Do your community meetings look more 
like the Jerry Springer show than an energetic forum for 
healthy communication? If so, both you and the community 
have a lot to gain by focusing on how you handle high-stakes 
discussions. WHArs A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 15 
Imp rove Your Personal Health 
If the evidence so far isn't compelling enough to focus your 
attention on crucial conversations, what would you say if we told 
you that the ability to master high-stakes discussions is a key to 
a healthier and longer life? 
Immune systems. Consider the ground breaking research done 
by Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and Dr. Ronald Glaser. They studied 
the immune systems of couples who had been married an aver­
age of forty-two years by comparing those who argued constantly 
with those who resolved their differences effectively. It turns out 
that arguing for decades doesn 'f lessen the destructive blow of 
constant conflict. Quite the contrary. Those who routinely failed 
their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems than 
those who found a way to resolve them well.4 Of course, the 
weaker the immune system, the worse their health. 
Life-threatening diseases. In perhaps the most revealing of all 
the health-related studies, a group of subjects who had contracted 
malignant melanoma received traditional treatment and then 
were divided into two groups. One group met weekly for only six 
weeks; the other did not. Facilitators taught the first group of 
recovering patients specific communication skills. (When it's 
your life that's at stake, could anything be more crucial?) 
After meeting only six times and then dispersing for five years, 
the subjects who learned how to express themselves effectively 
had a higher surviv al rate-only 9 percent succumbed as opposed 
to almost 30 percent in the untrained groUp.5 Think about the 
implications of this study. Just a modest improvement in ability to 
talk and connect with others corresponded to a two-thirds 
decrease in the death rate. 
We could go on for pages about how the ability to hold cru­
cial conversations has an impact on your personal health. The 
evidence is mounting every day. Nevertheless, most people find 16 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
this claim a bit over the top. "Come on," they chide. "You're say­
ing that the way you talk or don't talk affects your body? It could 
kill you?" 
The short answer is yes . The longer answer suggests that the 
negative feelings we hold in, the emotional pain we suffer, and 
the constant battering we endure as we stumble our way through 
unhealthy conversations slowly eat away at our health. In some 
cases the impact of failed conv ersations leads to minor problems. 
In others it results in disas ter. In all cases, failed conversations 
never make us happier, healthier, or better off. 
So how about you? What are the specific conversations that 
gnaw at you the most? Which conversations (if you held them or 
improved them) would strengthen your immune system, help 
ward off disease, and increase your quality of life and well-being? 
SUM MARY 
When stakes are high, opinions va ry, and emotions start to run 
strong, casual conversations become crucial. Ironica lly, the more 
crucial the conver sation, the less likely we are to handle it well. 
The consequences of either avoiding or fouling up crucial con­
versations can be severe. When we fail a crucial conversation, 
every aspect of our lives can be affected-from our careers, to 
our communities, to our relationship s, to our personal health. 
As we learn how to step up to crucial conversations-and 
handle them well-with one set of skills we can influence virt u­
ally every domain of our lives. 
What is this all-important skill-set? What do people who sail 
through crucial conversations actually do? More importantly, 
can we do it too? 2

Mastering 
Crucial 
Conversations 
The Power of Dialogue 
We (the authors) didn't always spend our time noodling over 
crucial conversations. In fact, we started our research into orga­
nizational and personal excellence by studying a slightly different 
topic. We figured that if we could learn why certain people were 
more effective than others, then we could learn exactly what they 
did, clone it, and pass it on to others. 
To find the source of success, we started at work. We asked 
people to identify who they thought were their most effective 18 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
colleagues. In fact, over the past twenty-five years, we've asked 
over twenty thousand people to identify the individuals in their 
organizations who could really get things done. We wanted to 
find those who were not just influential, but who were far more 
influential than the rest. 
Each time, as we compiled the names into a list, a pattern 
emerged. Some people were named by one or two colleagues. 
Some found their way onto the lists of five or six people. These 
were the good at influenc e, but not good enough to be widely 
identified as top performers. And then there were the handful 
who were named thirty or more times. These were the best-the 
clear opinion leaders in their areas. Some were managers and 
supervisors. Many were not. 
One of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested 
in meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice 
presidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influ­
ential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. 
At first, Kevin didn't do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked 
like every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct 
reports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine. 
The Startl ing Discovery 
After trailing Kevin for almost a week, we began to wonder if he 
really did act in ways that set him apart from others or if his 
influence was simply a matter of popularity. And then we fol­
lowed Kevin into a meeting. 
Kevin, his peers, and their boss were deciding on a new loca­
tion for their offices-would they move across town, across the 
state, or across the country? The first two execs presented their 
arguments for their top choices, and as expected, their points were 
greeted by penetrating questions from the full team. No vague 
claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquesti oned. MASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 19 
Then Chris, the CEO, pitched his preference-one that was 
both unpopular and potentially disastrous. However, when peo­
ple tried to disagree or push back on Chris, he responded poorly. 
Since he was the big boss, he didn't exactly have to browbeat 
people to get what he wanted. Instead, he became slightly defen­
sive. First he raised an eyebrow. Then he raised his finger. Finally 
he raised his voice-j ust a little. It wasn't long until people 
stopped questioning him, and Chris's inadequate proposal was 
quietly accepted. 
Well almost. That's when Kevin spoke up. His words were 
simple enough-so mething like, "Hey Chris, can I check some­
thing out with you?" 
The reaction was stunning-everyone in the room stopped 
breathing. But Kevin ignored the apparent terror of his col­
leagues and plunged on ahead. In the next few minutes he in 
essence told the CEO that he appeared to be violating his own 
decision-making guidelines. He was subtly using his power to 
move the new offices to his hometown. 
Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when 
he finished the first crucial minutes of this delicate exchange, 
Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. "You're 
absolutely right," he finally concluded. "I have been trying to 
force my opinion on you. Let's back up and try again." 
This was a crucial conversation, and Kevin played no games 
whatsoever. He didn't resort to silence like his colleagues, nor 
did he try to force his argument s on others. As a result, the team 
chose a far more reasonable location and Kevin's boss appreci­
ated his candor. 
When Kevin was done, one of his peers turned to us and said, 
"Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets 
things done, figure out what he just did." 
So we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discov­
ering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set 20 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
them apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to deal with 
crucial conve rsations. When talking turned tough and stakes 
were high, they excelled. But how? Kevin wasn't that different. 
He did step up to a tough issue and help the team make a better 
choice, but what exactly did he do? Did he possess learnable 
skills, or was what he did more magical than manag eable? 
To answer these questions, first, let's explore what Kevin was 
able to achieve. This will help us see where we're trying to go. Then 
we'll examine the dialogue tools effective communicators routinely 
use and learn to apply them to our own crucial conversations. 
THE "ONE THING" 
If you've seen the movie City Slickers, you may remember a scene 
where the crusty character Curly explains that if you want to suc­
ceed in life you have to do one thing. Then, in typical Hollywood 
fashion, he explains that he's not about to tell you what that one 
thing is. You have to figure it out yourself. 
We won't pull a Curly. We'll reveal the one thing. When it 
comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled 
people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves 
and others) out into the open. 
That's it. At the core of every successful conversation lies the 
free flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly 
express their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their 
theories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when 
their ideas are controversial or unpopular. It's the one thing, and 
it's precisely what Kevin and the other extremely effective com­
municators we studied were routinely able to achieve. 
Now, to put a label on this spectacular talent-it's called dia­
logue. 
di·a·logue or di·a·log (di' a-lOg", -log) n 
The free flow of meaning between two or more people. MASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 21 
HE RE'S HOW DIALOGUE WORKS 
Despite the fact that we've shared the one thing, we're still left 
with two questions. First, how does this free flow of meaning lead 
to success? Second, what can you do to encourage meaning to 
flow freely? 
We'll explain the relationship between the free flow of mean­
ing and success right here and now. The second question-what 
you must do to stay in dialogue, no matter the circumstances­
takes the rest of the book. 
Filling the Pool of Shar ed Meaning 
Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, 
theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique 
combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal 
pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us but also propels 
our every action. 
When two or more of us enter crucial conversations, by defi­
nition we don't share the same pool. Our opinions differ. I 
believe one thing, you another. I have one history, you another. 
People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe 
for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool-e ven 
ideas that at first glance appear controver sial, wrong, or at odds 
with their own beliefs. Now, obviously they don't agree with 
every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find 
their way into the open. 
As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in 
two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate 
and relevant information, they make better choices. In a very 
real sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of a 
group's IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the deci­
sions. And even though many people may be involved in a 
choice. when people openly and freely share ideas, the 22 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
increased time investment is more than offset by the quality of 
the decision. 
On the other hand, we've all seen what happens when the 
shared pool is dangerou sly shall ow. When people purposefully 
withhold meaning from one another, individually smart people 
can do collectively stupid things. 
For example, a client of ours shared the following story. 
A woman checked into the hospital to have a tonsillecto my, 
and the surgical team erroneously removed a portion of her foot. 
How could this tragedy happen? In fact, why is it that ninety­
eight thousand hospital deaths each year stem from human 
error?! In part because many health-care professionals are afraid 
to speak their minds. In this case, no less than seven people won­
dered why the surgeon was working on the foot, but said noth­
ing. Meaning didn't freely flow because people were afraid to 
speak up. 
Of course, hospitals don't have a monopoly on fear. In every 
instance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and out­
spoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their 
opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. 
On the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up 
and meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically 
increase a group's ability to make better decisions. Consider what 
happened to Kevin's group. As everyone on the team began to 
explain his or her opinion, people formed a more clear and com­
plete picture of the circumstance s. 
As they began to understand the whys and wherefores of dif­
ferent proposals, they built off one another. Eventual ly, as one 
idea led to the next, and then to the next, they came up with an 
alternative that no one had originally thought of and that all 
wholeheartedly supported. As a result of the free flow of mean­
ing, the whole (final choice) was truly greater than the sum of the 
original parts. In short: MASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 23 
The Pool of Shared Meaning 
is the birthplace of synergy. 
Not only does a shared pool help individuals make better 
choices, but since the meaning is shared, people willingly act on 
whatever decisions they make. As people sit through an open 
discussion where ideas are shared, they take part in the free flow 
of meaning. Eventually they understand why the shared solution 
is the best solution, and they're committed to act. For example, 
Kevin and the other VPs didn't buy into their final choice simply 
because they were involved; they bought in because they under­
stood. 
Conver sely, when people aren't involved, when they sit back 
quietly during touchy conve rsations, they're rarely committed to 
the final decision. Since their ideas remain in their heads and 
their opinions never make it into the pool, they end up quietly 
criticizing and pas sively resisting. Worse still, when others force 
their ideas into the pool, people have a harder time accepting the 
information. They may say they're on board, but then walk away 
and follow through halfheartedly. To quote Samuel Butler, "He 
that complies against his will is of his own opinion still." 
The time you spend up front establish ing a shared pool of 
meaning is more than paid for by faster, more committed action 
later on. 
For example, if Kevin and the other leaders had not been 
committed to their relocation decision, terrible consequences 
would have followed. Some people would have agreed to move; 
others would have dragged their feet. Some would have held 
heated discus sions in the hallways . Others would have said noth­
ing and then quietly fought the plan. More likely than not, the 
team would have been forced to meet again, discuss again, and 
decide again-since only one person favored the decision and the 
decision affected everyone . 24 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Now, don't get us wrong. We're not suggesting that every 
decision be made by consensus or that the boss shouldn't take 
part in or even make the final choice. We're simply suggesting 
that whatever the decision-making method, the greater the 
shared meaning in the pool, the better the choice-whoever 
makes it. 
Every time we find ourselves arguing, debating, running away, 
or otherwise acting in an ineffective way, it's because we don't 
know how to share meaning. Instead of engaging in healthy dia­
logue, we play silly and costly games. 
For instance, sometimes we move to silence. We play Salute 
and Stay Mute. That is, we don't confront people in positions of 
authority. Or at home we may play Freeze Your Lover. With this 
tortured technique we give loved ones the cold shoulder in order 
to get them to treat us better (what's the logic in that?). 
Sometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, innuendo, and looks of 
disgust to make our points. We play the martyr and then pretend 
we're actually trying to help. Afraid to confront an individual, we 
blame an entire team for a problem-hoping the message will hit 
the right target. Whatever the technique, the overall method is 
the same. We withhold meaning from the pool. We go to silence. 
On other occasions, not knowing how to stay in dialogue, we 
rely on violence- anything from subtle manipulation to verbal 
attacks. We act like we know everything, hoping people will 
believe our argument s. We discredit others, hoping people won't 
believe their argument s. And then we use every manner of force 
to get our way. We borrow power from the boss; we hit people 
with biased monologues. The goal, of course, is always the 
same- to compel others to our point of view. 
Now , here's how the various elements fit together. When stakes 
are high, opinions va ry, and emotions run strong, we're often at 
our worst. In order to move to our best, we have to find a way to 
explain what is in each of our personal pools of meaning-MASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 25 
especially our high-stakes, sensitive, and controversial opinions, 
feelings, and ideas-a nd to get others to share their pools. We 
have to develop the tools that make it safe for us to discuss these 
issues and to come to a shared pool of meaning. And when we do, 
our lives change. 
DIAL OGUE SKI LLS ARE LEARNABLE 
And now for the really good news. The skills required to master 
high-stakes interactions are quite easy to spot and moderately 
easy to learn. First consider the fact that a well-handled crucial 
conversation all but leaps out at you. In fact, when you see some­
one enter the dangerous waters of a high-stakes, high-emotion, 
controversial discussion-and the person does a particularly 
good job- your natural reaction is to step back in awe. "Wow!" 
is generally the first word out of your mouth. What starts as a 
doomed discussion ends up with a healthy resolution. It can take 
your breath away. 
More importantly, not only are dialogue skills easy to spot, but 
they're also fairly easy to learn. That's where we're going next. 
We've isolated and captured the skills of the dialogue-gifted 
through twenty-five years of nonstop "Wow!" research. First we 
followed around Kevin and dozens like him. Then, when conver­
sations turned crucial, we took detailed notes. Afterward we 
compared our observations, tested our hypotheses, and honed 
our models until we found the skills that consistently explain the 
success of brilliant communicators. Finally, we combined our 
philosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learn­
able tools-tools for talking when stakes are high. 
Now we're ready to share what we've learned. Stay with us as 
we explore how to transform crucial convers ations from fright­
enin g events into interactions that yield success and results. It's 
the mosl important set of skills you'll ever master. 26 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
HERE'S WH ERE WE'RE GOING 
Here's what we'll focus on in the remainder of the book. 
First, we'll explore the tools people use to help create the con­
ditions of dialogue. The focus is on how we think about problem 
situations and what we do to prepare for them. As we work on 
ourselves, watch for problems, examine our own thought 
processes, discover our own styles, and then catch problems 
before they get out of hand, everyone benefits. As you read on, 
you will learn how to crea te conditions in yourself and others 
that make dialogue the path of least resistance. 
Next, we'll examine the tools for talking, listening, and acting 
together. This is what most people have in mind when they think 
of crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? 
How do I speak persuas ively, not abrasively? And how about lis­
tening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when 
they seem nervo us? And how do we move from thought to 
action? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, 
listening, and acting together. 
Finally, we'll tie all of the theories and skills together by pro­
viding both a model and an extended example. Then, to see if 
you can really do what it takes, we provide seventeen situations 
that would give most of us fits-e ven people who are gifted at 
dialogue. As you read on, you will master the tools for talking 
when stakes are high. 3

Start with Heart 
How to Stay Focused 
on What You Really Want 
It's time to tum to the how of dialogue. How do you encourage 
the flow of meaning in the face of differing opinions and strong 
emotions? Given the average person's track record, it can't be all 
that easy. In fact, given most people's long-standing habit of cost­
ly behaviors, it'll probably require a lot of effort. The truth is, 
people can change. In fact, thousands of people we (the authors) 
have worked with over the past decades have made lasting 
improvements. But it requires work. You can't simply drink a 
magic potion and walk away renewed. Instead, you'll need to 
take a long hard look at yourself. 
In fact, this is the first principle of dialogue-Start with 
ll eart. That is, your own heart. If you can't get yourself right, 28 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
you'll have a hard time getting dialogue right. When conv ersa­
tions become crucial you'll resort to the forms of communication 
that you've grown up with-debate, silent treatment, manipula­
tion, and so on. 
WHEN WE DON' T WORK ON ME FIRST 
Let's start with a true story. Two young sisters and their father scur­
ry into their hotel room after spending a hot afternoon at Disney­
land. Given the repressive heat, the girls have consumed enough 
soda pop to fill a small barrel . As the two bursting kids enter their 
room, they have but one thought-to head for the head. 
Since the bathroom is a one-holer, it isn't long until a fight 
breaks out. Both of the desperate children start arguing, pushing, 
and name-calling as they dance around the tiny bathroom. Event­
ually one calls out to her father for help. 
"Dad, 1 got here first!" 
"I know, but 1 need to go worse!" 
"How do you know? You're not in my body. 1 didn't even go 
before we left this morning !" 
"Y ou're so selfish." 
Dad proposes a plan. "Girls, I'm not going to solve this for 
you. You can stay in the bathroom and figure out who goes first 
and who goes second. There's only one rule. No hitting." 
As the two antsy kids begin their crucial conversation, Dad 
checks his watch. He wonders how long it'll take. As the minutes 
slowly tick away, he hears nothing more than an occasional out­
burst of sarcasm. Finally after twenty-five long minut es, the toi­
let flushes. One girl comes out. A minute later, another flush and 
out walks her sister. With both girls in the room, Dad asks, "D o 
you know how many times both of you could have gone to the 
bathroom in the time it took you to work that out?" 
The idea had not occurred to the little scamps, but the instant 
it does, it's obvious what both immediately conclude. START WITH HEART 29 
"Lots of times, if she hadn't been such a jerk." 
"L isten to her. She's calling me names when she could have 
just waited. She always has to have her way!" 
DON' T LOOK AT ME! 
Laugh as we may at this story, these two kids behave no differ­
ently from the rest of us. When faced with a failed conv ersation, 
most of us are quick to blame others. If others would only 
change, then we'd all live happily ever after. If others weren't so 
screwed up, we wouldn't have to resort to silly games in the first 
place. They started it. It's their fault, not ours. And so on. 
Although it's true that there are times when we are merely 
bystanders in life's never-ending stream of head-on collisions, 
rarely are we completely innocent . More often than not, we do 
something to contribute to the problems we're experiencing. 
People who are best at dialogue understand this simple fact and 
tum it into the principle "Work on me first." They realize that not 
only are they likely to benefit by improving their own approach, 
but also that they're the only person they can work on anyway. As 
much as others may need to change, or we may want them to 
change, the only person we can continually inspire, prod, and 
shape-with any degree of success-is the person in the mirror. 
There's a certain irony embedded in this fact. People who 
believe they need to start with themselves do just that. As they 
work on themselves, they also become the most skilled at dia­
logue. So here's the irony. It's the most talented, not the least tal­
ented, who are continually trying to improve their dialogue 
skills. As is often the case, the rich get richer. 
START WITH HEART 
Okay, let's assume we need to work on our own personal dia­
lugue skil ls. In stead of buying this book and then handing it to a 30 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
loved one or coworker and saying: "You'll love this, especially 
the parts that I've underlined for you," we'll try to figure out how 
we ourselves can benefit. But how? Where do we start? How can 
we stay clear of unhealthy games? 
Although it's difficult to describe the specific order of even ts 
in an interaction as fluid as a crucial conver sation, we do know 
one thing for certain: Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, 
they begin high-risk discussions with the right motive s, and they 
stay focused no matter what happens. 
They maintain this focus in two ways. First, they're steely-eyed 
smart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite con­
stant invitations to slip away from their goals, they stick with 
them. Second, skilled people don't make Sucker's Choices 
(either/or choices). Unlike others who justify their unhealthy 
behavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or 
take flight, the dialogue-smart believe that dialogue, no matter 
the circumstance s, is always an option. 
Let's look at each of these important heart-based assumptions 
in turn. 
A MOM ENT OF TRUTH 
To see how the desires of our hearts can affect our ability to stay 
in dialogue, let's take a look at a real-life example. 
Greta, the CEO of a mid-sized corporation, is two hours into 
a rather tense meeting with her top leaders. For the past six 
months she has been on a personal campaign to reduce costs. 
Little has been accomplished to date, so Greta calls the meeting. 
Surely people will tell her why they haven't started cutting costs. 
After all, she has taken great pains to foster candor. 
Greta has just opened the meeting to questions when a man­
ager haltingly rises to his feet, fidgets, stares at the floor, and 
then nervously asks if he can ask a very tough question. The way START WITH HEART 31 
the fellow emphasizes the word very makes it sound as if he's 
about to accuse Greta of kidnapping the Lindbergh bab y. 
The frightened manager continues. 
"Greta, you've been at us for six months to find ways to cut 
costs. I'd be lying if I said that we've given you much more than 
a lukewarm response. If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you about 
one thing that's making it tough for us to push for cost cuts ." 
"Great. Fire away," Greta says as she smiles in response. 
"Well, while you've been asking us to use both sides of our paper 
and forego improvements, you're having a second office built." 
Greta freezes and turns bright red. Everyone looks to see what 
will happen next. The manager plunges on ahead. 
"The rumor is that the furniture alone will cost $1 50,000. Is 
that right?" 
So there we have it. The conversation has just turned crucial. 
Someone has just poured a rather ugly tidbit into the pool of 
meaning. Will Greta continue to encourage honest feedback, or 
will she shut the fellow down? 
We call this a crucial conversation because how Greta acts 
during the next few moments will not only set people's attitudes 
toward the proposed cost cutting, but will also have a huge 
impact on what the other leaders think about her. Does she walk 
the talk of openness and honesty? Or is she a raging hypocrite­
like so many of the senior executives who came before her? 
Will We Get Hooked ? 
How Greta behaves during this crucial conversation depends a 
great deal on how she handles her emotions while under attack. 
Sure, when she's giving a speech or writing a memo, she's all for 
candor. She's a veri table cheerleader for candor. But what about 
now? Will Greta thank the fellow for taking a huge risk and 
being honest? 32 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
If she's like most of us, Greta will defend herself. When we're 
in the throes of high-stakes conv ersations, new (and less healthy) 
motives often supplant our original, more noble ones . If you are 
standing in front of a potentially hostile crowd, it's a good bet 
you will change your original goal to the new goal of protecting 
your public image. 
"Excuse me," you might respond. "I don't think that my new 
office is an appropriate topic for this forum." 
Bang. You're dead. In one fell swoop you've lost buy-in, 
destroyed any hope for candor in this particular conv ersation, 
and confirmed everyone's suspicion that you want honesty-but 
only as long as it makes you look good. 
FI RST, FOCUS ON WHAT YOU REAll Y WANT 
In reality, Greta didn't give in to her raging desire to defend her­
self. After being accused of not following her own advice, at first 
she looked surprised, embarra ssed, and maybe even a little 
upset. Then she took a deep breath and said: "You know what? 
We need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. It'll 
give us a chance to discuss what's really going on." 
And then Greta talked turkey. She explained that she felt the 
office was necessary but admitted that she had no idea what it 
would cost. So she sent someone to check the number s. 
Meanwhile, she explained that building the office was a response 
to marketing's advice to boost the company's image and improve 
client confidence. And while Greta would use the office, it would 
be primarily a hosting location for marketing. When she saw the 
figures for the office, Greta was stunned and adm itted that she 
should have checked the costs before signing a work order. So 
then and there she committed to drawing up a new plan that 
would cut costs by half or canceling the project entirely. START WITH HEART 33 
Later that day we asked Greta how she had been able to keep 
her composure under fire. We wanted to know exactly what had 
been going on in her head. What had helped her move from 
embarrassment and anger to gratitude? 
"It was easy ," Greta explained. "At first I did feel attacked, 
and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that 
guy in his place. He was accusing me in public and he was 
wrong." 
"And then it struck me," she continued. "Despite the fact that I 
had four hundred eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important ques­
tion hit me like a ton of bricks: 'What do I really want here?'" 
Asking this question had a powerful effect on Greta's think­
ing. As she focused on this far more important question, she 
quickly realized that her goal was to encourage these two hun­
dred managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts-a nd to 
thereby influence thousands of others to do the same. 
As Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest 
barrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hyp­
ocrite. On the one hand, she was calling for others to sacrifice. 
On the other, she appeared to be spending discretionary funds for 
her own comfort. It was at that moment that she was no longer 
ashamed or angry, but grateful. She couldn't have asked for a bet­
ter opportunity to influence these leaders than the one offered up 
by this penetrating question. And so she moved to dialogue. 
Refocus your brain. Now, let's move to a situation you might 
face. You're speaking with someone who completely disagrees 
with you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As 
you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going 
in, ask yourself what you really want. 
Also, as the conver sation unfolds and you find yourself start­
ing to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoul­
der , pay attention to what's happening to your objectives. Are 34 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embar rass­
ment, win, be right, or punish others? Here's the tricky part. Our 
motives usually change without any conscious thought on our 
part. When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow 
with the chemical tide. 
In order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you 
must step away from the interaction and look at yours elf­
much like an outsider. Ask yourself: "What am I doing, and if I 
had to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive ?" 
As you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you 
might conclude: "Let's see. I'm pushing hard, making the argu­
ment stronger than I actually believe, and doing anything to 
win. I've shifted from trying to select a vacation location to try­
ing to win an argument ." 
Once you call into question the shifting desires of your heart, 
you can make conscious choices to change them. "What I really 
want is to genuinely try to select a vacation spot we can all 
enjoy-rather than try to win people over to my ideas ." Put suc­
cinctly, when you name the game, you can stop playing it. 
But how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, 
stop playing games, and then influence your own motives? Do 
what Greta did. Stop and ask yourself some questions that 
return you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when 
you find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when 
you prepare to step up to a crucial conversation. Here are some 
great ones: 
What do I really want for myself? 
What do I really want for others? 
What do I really want for the relationship? 
Once you've asked yourself what you want, add one more 
equally telling question: START WITH HEART 35 
How would I behave if I really wanted these results? 
Find your bearings. There are two good reasons for asking these 
questions. First, the answer to what we really want helps us to 
locate our own North Star. Despite the fact that we're being tempt­
ed to take the wrong path by (1) people who are trying to pick a 
fight, (2) thousands of years of genetic hardwiring that brings our 
emotions to a quick boil, and (3) our deeply ingrained habit of try­
ing to win, our North Star returns us to our original purpose. 
"What do I really want? Oh yeah, I guess it's not to make 
the other person squirm or to preen in front of a crowd. I 
want people to freely and openly talk about what it'll take 
to cut costs ." 
Take charge of your body. The second reason for asking what 
we really want is no less important. When we ask ourselves what 
we really want, we affect our entire physiology. As we introduce 
complex and abst ract questions to our mind, the problem-solv­
ing part of our brain recognizes that we are now dealing with 
intricate social issues and not physical threats. When we present 
our brain with a demanding question, our body sends precious 
blood to the parts of our brain that help us think, and away from 
the parts of our body that help us take flight or begin a fight. 
Asking questions about what we really want serve s two 
important purpo ses. First, it reminds us of our goal. Second, it 
juices up our brain in a way that helps us keep focused. 
Comm on Deviations 
As we step up to a crucial conversation, fully intending to stim­
ul ate the flow of meaning, many of us quickly change our origi­
Ilal objectives to much less healthy goals. For instance, when 
Greta fell un der public attack, her immediate reaction was to do 36 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
whatever it took to save face. Other common, but not·all-that­
healthy, objectives include wanting to win, seeking revenge, and 
hoping to remain safe. 
Want ing to win. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top 
of many of our lists. Heaven only knows that we come by this 
deadly passion naturally enough. Half of the lV programs we 
watch make heroes out of people who win at sports or game 
shows. Ten minutes into kindergarten we learn that if we want 
to get the teacher's attention, we have to spout the right answer. 
That means we have to beat our fellow students at the same 
game. This desire to win is built into our very fiber before we're 
old enough to know what's going on. 
Unf ortunate ly, as we grow older, most of us don't realize that 
this desire to win is continually driving us away from healthy dia­
logue. We start out with the goal of resolving a problem, but as 
soon as someone raises the red flag of inaccuracy or challenges 
our correctness, we switch purposes in a heartbeat. 
First we correct the facts. We quibble over details and point 
out flaws in the other person's arguments. 
"You're wrong! We're not spending anywhere near a hun­
dred and fifty thous and dollars on the furniture. It's the 
redesign of the office that's costing so much, not the fur­
niture ." 
Of course, as others push back, trying to prove their points, 
it's not long until we change our goal from correcting mistakes 
to winning. 
If you doubt this simple allegation, think of the two antsy 
young girls as they stared each other down in the cramped bath­
room. Their original goal was simple enough-relief. But soon, 
caught up in their own painful game, the two set their ja ws and 
committed to doing whatever it took to win-even if it brought 
them a fair amount of personal discomfort. START WITH HEART 37 
Seeking revenge. Sometimes, as our anger increa ses, we move 
from wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other per­
son. Just ask Greta. "To heck with honest communication !" she 
thinks to herself. "I'll teach the moron not to attack me in pub­
lic." Eventuall y, as emotions reach their peak, our goal becomes 
completely perverted. We move so far away from adding mean­
ing to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer. 
"I can't believe that you're accusing me of squandering 
good money on a perfectly fine office. Now, if nobody else 
has any intelligent questions, let's move on !" 
Everyone immediately clams up and looks at the floor. The 
silence is deafening. 
Hoping to remain safe. Of course, we don't always fix mis­
takes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make 
them suffer. Sometimes we choose personal safety over dialogue. 
Rather than add to the pool of meaning, and possibly make 
waves along the way, we go to silence. We're so uncomfortable 
with the immediate conflict that we accept the certaint y of bad 
results to avoid the possib ility of uncomfortable conv ersation. 
We choose (at least in our minds) peace over conflict. Had this 
happened in Greta's case, nobody would have raised concerns 
over the new office, Greta never would have learned the real 
issue, and people would have continued to drag their feet. 
SECOND, REFUSE THE SUCKER'S CHOICE 
Now, let's add one more tool that helps us focus on what we real­
ly want. We'll start with a story. 
The faculty of Beaumont High School is hashing out possible 
cur riculum changes in an af ter-school meeting that's been going 
on for hours. It's finally the science department's turn to present. 
Roycc, a chem istr y tcacher who's been at Beaumont for 38 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
thirty-three years, considers himself the elder statesm an of 
the school. He's much more fond of war stories than he is of 
neutrons and electrons, but the administration kind of turns 
a blind eye, because the guy's a fixture. 
At the principal's cue, Royce clears his throat and begins to 
yammer on incoherently about the similarities between curricu­
lum development and battle preparations. His antics are so 
embarra ssing that the audience quietly heaves their shoulders as 
they futilely try to stifle their laughter. 
Next, it's Brent's, the new guy's, turn. A couple of weeks ago, 
the principal asked him to outline the science department's pro­
posed curriculum changes. Brent met with his colleagues (even 
Royce), gathered suggestions, and came ready to present. 
As Brent begins, Royce starts demonstrating bayonet offen­
sives with a yardstick, and Brent snaps. Slamming his fist on the 
table, he shouts, "Am I the only one who wonders why we even 
allow this fosil to talk? Did he miss a pill or something? " 
A room full of stunned faces turns toward Brent. Realizing 
that his colleagues must think he's possessed, Brent utters those 
words we've all come to hate, "Hey, don't look at me like that! 
I'm the only one around who has the guts to speak the truth." 
What a tactic. Brent slams Royce in public, and then instead 
of apologizing or maybe simply fading into the shadows, he 
argues that what he just did was somehow noble. 
Two ugly options. This pernicious strategy is particularly well 
suited for keeping us off track. It's known as a Sucker's Choice. 
In order to jus tify an especially sordid behavior, we suggest that 
we're caught between two distas teful options. Either we can be 
honest and attack our spouse, or we can be kind and withhold 
the truth. Either we can disagree with the boss to help make a 
better choice-and get shot for it-or we can remain quiet, 
starve the pool, and keep our job . Pick your poison. START WITH HEART 39 
What makes these Sucker's Choices is that they're always 
set up as the only two options ava ilable. It's the worst of 
either/or thinking. The person making the choice never sug­
gests there's a third option that doesn't call for unhealthy 
behavior. For example, maybe there's a way to be honest and 
respectful. Perhaps we can express our candid opinion to our 
boss and be safe. 
Those offering up a Su cker's Choice either don't think of a 
third (and healthy) option-in which case it's an honest but 
tragic mistak e-or set up the false dichotomy as a way of jus­
tifying their unattractive actions. "I'm sorry, but I just had to 
destroy the guy's self-image if I was going to keep my integrit y. 
It wasn't pretty, but it was the right thing to do." 
Open Yourself to Change 
Not only do Sucker's Choices set us up to take ineffective 
actions, but they close us down to change. They present our 
brain with problems easily solved with restr icted blood flow. 
After all, if we are simply choosing between fight and flight, 
who needs much creative thought? 
They also keep us stuck in ineffective strat egies by jus tifying 
our attacking or retreating behav iors. Why alter our behavior 
when we're the only one savvy enough to keep quiet? "St and 
up to my boss? What turnip wagon did you just fall off?" "Tell 
my spouse that her parental style is too controlling? No way. 
I' ll pay for years ." In a similar vein, why would you ever change 
when you think you're the only one around with an ounce of 
integrity? "Somebody has to state the ugly truth. It's the only 
way I can look myself in the mirror." 
In summ ary, Sucker's Choices are simplistic tradeoffs that 
keep us r rom thinking creatively of ways to get to dialogue, and 
that justi fy our silly games. 40 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
So how do we break away from perverted logic that keeps us 
trapped in hurtful behavior? 
Search for the Elusive And 
The best at dialogue refuse Sucker's Choices by setting up new 
choices. They present themselves with tougher question s­
questions that turn the either/or choice into a search for the all­
important and ever-elusive and. (It is an endangered species, 
you know.) Here's how this works. 
First, clarify what you really want. You've got a head start if 
you've already Started with Heart. If you know what you want 
for yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you're in 
position to break out of the Sucker's Choice. 
"What I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I'm 
tired of being let down by him when he makes commit­
ments that I depend on." 
Second, clarify what you really don't want. This is the key to 
framing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will 
happen to you if you back away from your current strategy of 
trying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you 
stop pushing so hard? Or if you don't try to escape? What hor­
rible outcome makes game-playing an attractive and sensible 
option? 
"What I don't want is to have a useless and heated conver­
sation that creates bad feelings and doesn't lead to change." 
Third, present your brain with a more complex problem. 
Finally, combine the two into an and question that forces you to 
search for more creative and productive options than silence and 
violence. START WITH HEART 41 
"How can I have a candid conversation with my husband 
about being more dependable and avoid creating bad feel­
ings or wasting our time?" 
It's interesting to watch what happens when people are pre­
sented with and questions after being stuck with Sucker's 
Choices. Their faces become reflective, their eyes open wider, 
and they begin to think. With surprising regularity, when people 
are asked: "Is it possible that there's a way to accomplish both?" 
they acknowledge that there very well may be. 
Is there a way to tell your peer your real concerns and not insult 
or offend him? 
Is there a way to talk to your neighbors about their annoying 
behavior and not come across as self-righteous or demanding? 
Is there a way to talk with your loved one about how you're 
spending money and not get into an argument? 
IS THIS REAll Y POSSI BLE? 
Some people find this whole line of thinking comically unrealis­
tic. From their point of view, Sucker's Choices aren't false 
dichotomies; they're merely a reflection of an unfortunate reality. 
"You can't say something to the boss about our upcoming 
move . It'll cost you your job." 
To these people we say: Remember Kevin? He, and almost every 
other opinion leader we've ever studied, has what it takes to speak 
up and maintain respect. Maybe you don't know what Kevin did or 
what you need to do-but don't deny the existence of Kevin or peo­
ple like him. There is a third set of options out there that allows you 
tu add meaning to the pool and build on the relationship. 42 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
When we (the authors) are in the middle of an on-site work­
shop and we suggest there are alternatives to Sucker's Choicesj 
someone invariably says: "Maybe you can speak honestly and 
still be heard in other organizations, but if you try it here, you'll 
be eaten alive !" Or the flip side: "You've got to know when to 
fold if you want to survive for another day." Then in a hail of "I'l l 
say!" and "Here, here!" many nod in agreement. 
At first, we thought that maybe there were places where dia­
logue couldn't survive . But then we learned to ask: "Are you say­
ing there isn't anyone you know who is able to hold a high-risk 
conver sation in a way that solves problems and builds relation­
ships?" There usually is. 
SUM MARY-START WITH HEART 
Here's how people who are skilled at dialogue stay focused on 
their goals-particularly when the going gets tough. 
Work on Me Fi rst 
• Remember that the only person you can directly control is 
yourself. 
Focus on Wh at You Really Want 
• When you find yourself moving toward silence or violenc ej 
stop and pay attention to your motives. 
• Ask yourself: "What does my behavior tell me about what 
my motives are?" 
• Then, clarify what you really want . Ask yourself: "What do 
I want for myself? For others? For the relationship?" 
• And finally, ask: "How would I behave if this were what I 
really wanted?" START WITH HEART 43 
Refuse the Sucker's Choice 
• As you consider what you want, notice when you start talking 
yourself into a Sucker's Choice. 
• Watch to see if you're telling yourself that you must choose 
between peace and hones ty, between winning and losing, 
and so on. 
• Break free of these Sucker's Choices by searching for the 
and. 
• Clarify what you don't want, add it to what you do want, 
and ask your brain to start searching for healthy options to 
bring you to dialogue. I have known a thousand scampsi

How to Notice When Safety 
Is at Risk 
Let's start this chapter by visiting a crucial conversation . You've 
just ended a heated debate with a group of people you supervi se. 
What started out as a harmless discussion about your new shift 
rotations ended up as a nasty argument. Mter an hour of carping 
and complaining, you finally went to your separate comers. 
You'r e now walking down the hall wondering what happened . 
In a matter of minutes an innocent discussion had transformed 
into a crucial conv ersation, and then into a failed conversation­
and you can't recall why. You do remember a tense moment 
when you started pushing your point of view a bit too hard 
(okay, maybe way too hard) and eight people stared at you as if 
you had just bitten the head off a chicken. But then the meeting 
ende d. 46 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
What you don't realize is that two of your friends are walking 
down the hallway in the opposite direction conducting a play-by­
play of the meeting. They do know what took place. 
"It happened again . The boss started pushing so hard for per­
sonal agenda items that we all began to act defensive ly. Did you 
notice how at one point all of our jaws dropped simultaneously? 
Of course, I was just as bad as the boss. I spoke in absolutes, 
only pointed out facts that supported my view, and then ended 
with a list of outlandish claims. I got hooked like a marlin ." 
Later that day as you talk to your friends about the meeting, 
they let you in on what happened . You were there, but somehow 
you missed what actually happened. 
"That's because you were so caught up in the content of the 
conversatio n," your buddy explains. "You cared so deeply about 
the shift rotation that you were blind to the conditions. You 
know-how people were feeling and acting, what tone they were 
taking, stuff like that." 
"You saw all that while still carrying on a heated conversa­
tion?" you ask. 
"Yeah," your coworker explains, "I always dual-proces s. That 
is, when things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the con­
versation along with what people are doing. I look for and exam­
ine both what and why. If you can see why people are becoming 
upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can 
do something to get back on track." 
"You look at the 'conditions,' and then you know what to do to 
get back on track?" 
"Sometimes," your friend answers. "But you've got to learn 
exactly what to look for." 
"It's a form of social first aid. By watching for the moment a con­
versation starts turning unhealthy, you can respond quickly. The 
sooner you catch a problem, the sooner you'll be able to work your 
way back to healthy dialogue, and the less severe the damage." LEARN TO LOOK 47 
You can't believe how obvious this advice is-and yet you've 
never thought of such a thing. Weirder still, your friend has. In 
fact, he has a whole vocabulary for what's going on during a cru­
cial conversation. It's as if you've been speaking another language. 
WATCH FOR COND ITIONS 
In truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (watching 
for content and conditions)-especially when it comes to a cru­
cial conversation. When both stakes and emotions are high, we 
get so caught up in what we're saying that it can be nearly impos­
sible to pull ourselves out of the argument in order to see what's 
happening to ourselves and to others. Even when we are startled 
by what's going on, enough so that we think: "Yipes ! This has 
turned ugly. Now what?" we may not know what to look for in 
order to turn things around . We may not see enough of what's 
happening. 
How could that be? How could we be smack-dab in the mid­
dle of a heated debate and not really see what's going on? A 
metaphor might help. It's akin to going fly fishing for the first 
time with an experienced angler. Your buddy keeps telling you to 
cast your fly six feet upstream from that brown trout "just out 
there." Only you can't see a brown trout "just out there." He can. 
That's because he knows what to look for. You think you do. You 
think you need to look for a brown trout. In reality, you need to 
look for a brown trout that's under water while the sun is reflect­
ing in your eyes. You have to look for elements other than the 
thing that your dad has stuffed and mounted over the fireplace. 
I t takes both knowledge and practice to know what to look for 
and then actually see it. 
So what do you look for when caught in the middle of a cru­
cia l conversation? What do you need to see in order to catch 
problems before they become too severe? Actually, it helps to 
watch fot' three different conditi ons: the moment a conversation 48 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
turns crucial, signs that people don't feel safe (silence or vio­
lence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let's consider each of 
these conversation killers in turn. 
learn to Spot Crucial Conversati ons 
First, stay alert for the moment a conver sation turns from a rou­
tine or harmless discussion into a crucial one. In a similar vein, 
as you anticipate entering a tough conv ersation, pay heed to the 
fact that you're about to enter the danger zone. Otherwise, yoti 
can easily get sucked into silly games before you realize what's 
happened. And as we suggested earlier, the further you stray off 
track, the harder it can be to return. 
To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to pay 
attention to the signs that suggest you're in a crucial conver sa­
tion. Some people first notice physical signals-their stomach 
gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your 
body when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit dif· 
ferent. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at 
them as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before 
things get out of hand. 
Others notice their emotions before they notice signs in theit 
body. They realize they are scared, hurt, or angry and are begin­
ning to react to or suppress these feelings. These emotions can 
also be great cues to tell you to step back, slow down, and take 
steps to turn your brain back on. 
Some people's first cue is not physical or emotional, but 
behavioral. It's like an out-of-body experience. They see them­
selves raising their voice, pointing their finger like a loaded 
weapon, or becoming very quiet. It's only then that they realize 
how they're feeling. 
So take a moment to think about some of your toughe st con­
versatio ns. What cues can you use to recognize that your brain LEARN TO LOOK 49 
is beginning to disengage and you're at risk of moving away from 
healthy dialogue? 
learn to look for Safety Problems 
If you can catch signs that the conversation is starting to tum cru­
cial- before you get sucked so far into the actual argument that 
you can never withdraw from the content-then you can start 
dual-processing immediately. And what exactly should you watch 
for? People who are gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on 
safety. They pay attention to the content-t hat's a given-and 
they watch for signs that people are afraid. When friends, loved 
ones, or colleagues move away from healthy dialogue (freely 
adding to the pool of meaning) -either forcing their opinions 
into the pool or purposefully keeping their ideas out of the pool­
they immediately tum their attention to whether or not others feel 
safe. 
When it's safe, you can say anything. Here's why gifted com­
municators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free 
flow of meaning-pe riod. And nothing kills the flow of meaning 
like fear. When you fear that people aren't buying into your 
ideas, you start pushing too hard. When you fear that you may 
be harmed in some way, you start withdrawing and hiding. Both 
these reactions-to fight and to take flight-are motivated by 
the same emotion: fear. On the other hand, if you make it safe 
enough, you can talk about almost anything and people wi1l lis­
ten. If you don't fear that you're being attacked or humiliated, 
you yourself can hear almost anything and not become defensive. 
Think about your own experience. Can you remember receiv­
ing really blistering feedback from someone at some point in your 
life, but in this instance you didn't become defensive? Instead, 
you ab sorbed the feedback. You reflected on it. You allowed it to 
inf luence you. If so, ask yourself why. Why in this instance were 50 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
you able to absorb potentially threatening feedback so well? If 
you're like the rest of us, it's because you believed that the other 
person had your best interest in mind. In addition, you respected 
the other person's opinion. You felt safe receiving the feedback 
because you trusted the motives and ability of the other person. 
You didn't need to defend yourself from what was being said. 
On the other hand, if you don't feel safe, you can't take any 
feedback. It's as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. "What do 
you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you rib­
bing me?" When you don't feel safe, even well-intended com­
ments are suspect. 
When it's unsafe, you start to go blind. By carefully watching 
for safety violations, not only can you see when dialogue is in 
danger, but you can also reengage your brain. As we've said 
before, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain func­
tions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, 
but your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you 
feel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what's 
right in front of you. Similarly, when you feel the outcome of a 
conversation is being threatened, you have a hard time seeing 
beyond the point you're trying to make. By pulling yourself out 
of the content of an argument and watching for fear, you reen­
gage your brain and your full vision return s. 
Don't let safety problems lead you astray. Let's add a note of 
caution. When others begin to feel unsafe, they start doing nasty 
things. Now, since they're feeling unsaf e, you should be thinking 
to yourself: "Hey, they're feeling unsafe . I need to do some­
thing-maybe make it safer." That's what you should be think­
ing. Unfortunate ly, since others feel unsaf e, they may be trying to 
make fun of you, insult you, or bowl you over with their argu­
ments. This kind of aggressive behavior doesn't exactly bring out 
the diplomat in you. So instead of taking their attack as a sign 
that safety is at risk, you take it at its face-as an attack. "I 'm LEARN TO LOOK 51 
under attack !" you think. Then you respond in kind . Or maybe 
you try to escape. Either way you're not dual-processing and 
then pulling out a skill to restore safety. Instead, you're becom­
ing part of the problem as you get pulled into the fight. 
Imagine the magnitude of what we're suggesting here. We're 
asking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are 
feeling unsaf e. We're asking you to fight your natural tendency 
to respond in kind . We're asking you to undo years of practice, 
maybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight 
or pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulu s. 
"Ah, that's a sign that the other person feels unsaf e." And then 
what? Do something to make it safe. In the next chapter we'll 
explore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety and then be 
curious, not angry or frightened. 
Silenc e and Violence 
As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two 
unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding mean­
ing from the pool) or to violence (trying to force meaning in the 
pool). That part we know. But let's add a little more detail. Just 
as a little knowledge of what to look for can tum blurry water 
into a brown trout, knowing a few of the common forms of 
silence and violence helps you see safety problems when they 
first start to happen . That way you can step out, restore safety , 
and return to dialogue-be fore the damage is too great. 
Silence 
Si lence consists of any act to purposefully withhold information 
from the pool of meaning. It's almost always done as a means of 
av oiding potential problems, and it always restricts the flow of 
meaning. Methods range from playing verbal games to avoiding 
u person entirely. The three most common forms of silence are 
mas king. avoiding, and withdrawing. 52 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
• Masking consists of understating or selectively showing our 
true opinions . Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some 
of the more popular forms. 
"J think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, that's it. J just worry 
that others won 't catch the subtle nua nces. Some ideas come 
before their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance. " 
Meaning: Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their 
last breath. 
"Oh yeah, that'll work like a charm. Offer people a discount , 
and they'll drive all the way across town just to save six cents 
on a box of soap. Where do you come up with this stuff?" 
Meaning: What a dumb idea. 
• Avoiding involves steering completely away from senSItIve 
subj ects. We talk, but without addressing the real issues. 
"How does your new suit look? Well, you know that blue's my 
favorite color. " 
Meaning: What happened? Did you buy your clothes at the 
circus? 
"Speaking of ideas for cost cutting -did you see Friends last 
night? Joey inherited a bun ch of money and was buying stu­
pid stuff. It was a hoot. " 
Meaning: Let's not talk about how to cut costs. It always leads 
to a fight. 
• Withdrawing means pulling out of a conversation altogether. 
We either exit the conversation or exit the room. 
"Excuse me. I've got to take this call. " 
Meaning: I'd rather gnaw off my own arm than spend one 
more minute in this useless meeting. LEARN TO LOOK 53 
"Sorry, I'm not going to talk about how to split up the phone 
bill again. I'm not sure our friendship can stand another bat­
tle. " (Exits.) 
Meaning: We can't talk about even the simplest of topics with­
out arguing. 
Vio lence 
Violence consists of any verbal strategy that attempts to convince, 
control, or compel others to your point of view. It violates safety 
by trying to force meaning into the pool. Methods range from 
name-calling and monologuing to making threats. The three most 
common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking. 
• Cont rolling consists of coercing others to your way of thinking. 
It's done through either forcing your views on others or domi­
nating the convers ation. Methods include cutting others off, 
overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing sub­
jects, or using directive questions to control the conversation. 
'There's not a person in the world who hasn 't bought one of 
these things. They're the perfect gift. " 
Meaning: I can't jus tify spending our hard-earned savings on 
this expensive toy, but I really want it. 
"We tried their product, but it was an absolute disaster. Every­
one knows that they can 't deliver on time and that they offer the 
worst customer service on the planet. " 
Meaning: I'm not certain of the real facts so I'll use hyperbole 
to get your attention. 
• Labeling is putting a label on people or ideas so we can dis­
miss them under a general stereotype or category . 
.. Your ideas are practically Nea nderthal. Any thinking person 
would follow my plan. " 54 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Meaning: I can't argue my case on its merits. 
"Y ou're not going to listen to them are you? For crying out loud! 
First, they're from headquarters. Second, they're engineers. Need 
I say more?" 
Meaning: If I pretend that all people from headquarters and all 
engineers are somehow bad and wrong, I won't have to explairl 
anything . 
• Attacking speaks for itself. You've moved from winning the 
argument to making the person suffer. Tactics include belittling 
and threatening. 
"Try that stupid little stunt and see what happens. " 
Meani ng: I will get my way on this even if I have to bad-mouth 
you and threaten some vague puni shment. 
"Don 't listen to a word Jim is saying. I'm sorry Jim, but I'm on 
to you. You're just trying to make it better for your team while 
making the rest of us suffer. I've seen you do it before. You're 
a real jerk, you know that? I'm sorry, but someone has to have 
the guts to tell it like it is. " 
Meaning: To get my way I'll say bad things about you and then 
pretend that I'm the only one with any integrity. 
look for Your Style Under Stress 
Let's say you've been watching for both content and conditions! 
You're paying special attention to when a conversation turns cru­
cial. To catch this important moment, you're looking for signs 
that safety is at risk. As safety is violated, you even know to 
watch for variou s forms of silence and violence . So are you now 
fully armed? Have you seen all there is to see? 
Actually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch 
closely as you're madly dual-processing is your own behavi or. LEARN TO LOOK 55 
Frankly, most people have trouble pulling themselves away from 
the tractor beam of the argument at hand. Then you've got the 
problem other people present as they employ all kinds of tactics. 
You've got to watch them like a hawk. It's little wonder that pay­
ing close attention to your own behavior tends to take a back­
seat. Besides, it's not like you can actually step out of your body 
and observe yourself. You're on the wrong side of your eyeballs . 
Low selfmon itors. The truth is, we all have trouble monitor­
ing our own behavior at times. We usually lose any semblance of 
social sensitivity when we become so consumed with ideas and 
causes that we lose track of what we're doing. We try to bully 
our way through. We speak when we shouldn't. We do things 
that don't work-all in the name of a cause. We eventually 
become so unaware that we become a bit like this fellow of Jack 
Handy's invent ion. 
«People were always talking about how mean this guy was 
who lived on our block. But I decided to go see for myself. 
I went to his door, but he said he wasn't the mean guy, the 
mean guy lived in that house over there. 'No, you stupid 
idiot, ' I said, 'that's my house. '" 
Unf ortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, 
you can look pretty silly. For example, you're talking to your 
spouse about the fact that he or she left you sitting at the auto 
repair shop for over an hour. After pointing out that it was a sim­
ple misunderstanding, your spouse exclaims: "You don't have to 
get angry." 
Then you utter those famous words: "I'm not angry!" 
Of course, you'r e spraying spit as you shout out your denial, 
and the vein on your forehead has swelled to the size of a teenage 
python. You, quite natural ly, don't see the inconsiste ncy in your 
response. You're in the middle of the whole thing, and you don't 
uppr cciatc it onc bit whcn your spouse laughs at you. 56 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
You also play this denial game when you ingenuously answer 
the question, "What's wrong?" 
"Nothing's wrong," you whimper. Then you shuffle your feet, 
stare at the floor, and look wounded . 
Bec ome a Vi gilan t Self- Mon itor 
What does it take to be able to step out of an argument and 
watch for process-including what you yourself are doing and 
the impact you're having? You have to become a vigilant self­
monitor. That is, pay close attention to what you're doing and 
the impact it's having, and then alter your strategy if necess ary. 
Specifically, watch to see if you're having a good or bad impact 
on safety.

Style Un der Stress Score 
Please fill out the score sheets in Figures 4-1 and 4-2. Each 
domain contains two to three questions. Next to the question 
number is either a (T) or an (F) . For example, under "Mask ing," 
question 5 on Figure 4- 1, you'll find a (T) . This means that if you 
answered it true, check the box. With question 13 on Figure 4-2, 
on the other hand, you'll find an (F) . Only check that box if you 
answered the question false-and so on. 
Your Style Under Stress score (Figure 4- 1) will show you 
which forms of silence or violence you turn to most often. Your 
Dialogue Skills score (Figure 4-2) is organized by concept and 
chapter so you can decide which chapters may benefit you the 
most. 
What Your Score Means 
Your silence and violence scores give you a measure of how fre­
quently you fall into these less-than-perfect strategies. It's actu­
ally possible to score high in both. A high score (one or two 
checked boxes per domain) means you use this technique fairly 
often. It also means you're human . Most people toggle between 
holding back and becoming too forceful.

Make It Safe 
How to Make It Safe to Talk 
about Almost Anything 
The last chapter contained a promise: If you spot safety risks as 
they happen, you can step out of the convers ation, build safety, 
and then find a way to dialogue about almost anything. In this 
chapter we'll fulfill that promise by teaching what it takes to 
restore safety. 
To get started, let's examine a situation where safety is at risk. 
We'll eavesdrop on a couple as they try to discuss one of the 
most delicate of topics-p hysical intima cy. 
First a little background. Jotham thinks he and Yvonne are inti­
mate with each other far too seldom. Yvonne is satisfied with their 
physical relationship. For years the two have acted out rather than 
talked out their concerns. When Jotham wants to be amorous and 66 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Yvonne doesn't respond, he goes to silence. He pouts, says almost 
nothing, and avoids Yvonne for the next few days. 
Yvonne knows what's going on with Jotham. Occasionally 
she'll go along with him even when she's not feeling particularly 
romantic. She does this in hopes of avoiding Jotham's pouting. 
Unf ortunately, she then feels resen tful toward Jotham, and it's 
much longer before she feels genuinely romantic toward him. 
So here's the game. The more Jotham insists and pouts, the less 
attractive and interesting he is to Yvonn e. The more Yvonne suc­
cumb s and then resents, the less she's interested in the entire rela­
tionship. The more both of them act out rather than talk out this 
crucial conversation, the more likely they are to end up going 
their separate ways. Yvonne has decided to broach the subject 
with Jotham. Rather than waiting until they're both upset, she's 
picked a time when they're relaxing on the couch. Here goes. 
YVONNE: Jotham, can we talk about what happened last 
night-you know, when I told you that I was tired? 
JOTHAM: I don't know if I'm in the mood. 
YVONNE: What's that supposed to mean? 
JOTHAM: I'm sick and tired of you deciding when we do 
what ! 
YVONNE: (walks out) 
STEP OUT. MAKE IT SAFE. THEN STEP BACK IN 
Okay, let's look at Yvonne. She tried to tackle a tough topic. 
Good for her. She was already uncomfortable and her partner 
took a cheap shot at her. Some help he was. Now what should 
she do? How can she get back to honest and healthy dialogue? 
What do you do when you don't feel like it's safe to share what's 
on your mind? MAKE IT SAFE 67 
The key is to step out of the content of the conver sation. Don't 
stay stuck in what's being said. Yvonne exited because she was 
focused on what Jotham was saying. If she had been looking at 
Jotham's behavior, she would have spotted his use of sarcasm­
a form of masking. Rather than talking out his concern, he's tak­
ing a potshot. Why would he do that? Because he doesn 't feel 
safe using dialogue. But Yvonne missed this point. 
Now, we're not suggesting that Jotham's behavior is acceptable, 
or that Yvonne should put up with it. But first things first-Start 
with Heart. The first question is: "What do I really want?" 
If you really want to have a healthy conversation about a topic 
that will make or break your relationship, then for a moment or 
two you may have to set aside confronting the current issue­
i.e., Jotham's sarcasm. 
Yvonne's challenge here is to build safety-enough so that she 
can talk about their physical relationship, about the way Jotham 
is dealing with it, or about any other concerns. But if she doesn't 
make it safe, all she's going to get is a continuation of the silence 
and violence games. 
So, what should she do? 
In these circumstances, the worst at dialogue do what both 
Jotham and Yvonne did. Like Jotham, they totally ignore the cry­
ing need for more safety. They say whatever is on their minds­
with no regard for how it will be received. Or like Yvonne, they 
conclude the topic is completely uns afe and move to silence. 
The good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly 
the wrong way. They try to make the subject more palatable by 
sugarcoating their message. "Oh, honey, I really want to be with 
you but I'm under a lot of pressu re at work, and the stress makes 
it hard for me to enjoy our time together." They try to make 
things safer by watering down their content. This strategy, of 
l:ourse, avoids the real problem, and it never gets fixed. 68 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The best don't play games. They know that dialogue is the free 
flow of meaning- with no pretending, sugarcoating, or faking. 
So they do something completely different. They step out of the 
content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. 
Once you've spotted safety problems, you can talk about the 
most challenging of topics by stepping out of the content and 
building enough safety that almost anything becomes discussable. 
For example: "Can we change gears for a minute? I'd like to talk 
about what happens when we're not romantically in sync. It would 
be good if we could both share what's working and what isn't. My 
goal isn't to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don't want to 
become defensive. What I'd really love is for us to come up with a 
solution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship." 
NOTICE WHICH CONDI TION IS AT RISK 
Now, let's look at a couple of pieces that help us establish safety­
even when the topic is high risk, controversial, and emotional. The 
first step to building more safety is to understand which of the two 
conditions of safety is at risk. Each requires a different solution. 
Mut ual Purpose 
Why Ta lk in the Fi rst Place? 
Remember the last time someone gave you difficult feedback and 
you didn't become defensive? Say a friend said some things to 
you that most people might get upset over. In order for this per­
son to be able to deliver the delicate message, you must have 
believed he or she cared about you, or about your goals and 
objectiv es. That means you trusted his or her purposes so you 
were willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. 
Crucial conversations often go awry not because of the con­
tent of the conversation, but because others believe that the MAKE IT SAFE 69 
painful and pointed content means that you have a malicious 
intent. How can they feel safe when they believe you're out to do 
them harm? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. 
Consequent ly, the first condition of safety is Mutual Purpose. 
Mutual Purpose means that others perceive that we are working 
toward a common outcome in the conver sation, that we care 
about their goals, interests, and valu es. And vice versa. We 
believe they care about ours . Consequ ently, Mutual Purpose is 
the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal and you have 
both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking. 
For example, if Jotham believes that Yvonne's purpose in rais­
ing this topic is to make him feel guilty or to get her way, this 
conversation is doomed from the outset. If he believes she really 
cares about making things better for him and herself, she may 
have a chance. 
Watch for signs that Mutual Pur pose is at risk. How do we 
know when the safety problem we're seeing is due to a lack of 
Mutual Purpose? It's actually fairly easy to spot. First and fore­
most, when purpose is at risk, we end up in debate. When others 
start forcing their opinions into the pool of meaning, it's often 
because they figure that we're trying to win and they need to do 
the same. Other signs that purpose is at risk include defensiveness, 
hidden agendas (the silence form of fouled-up purpose), accusa­
tions, and circling back to the same topic. Here are some crucial 
questions to help us determine when Mutual Purpose is at risk: 
• Do others believe I care about their goals in this conv ersation? 
• Do they trust my motives? 
Remember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the 
wise. Mutual Purpose is not a technique. To succeed in crucial 
conv ersations, we must really care about the interests of others­
not ju st our own. The purpose has to be truly mutual . If our goal 70 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
is to get our way or manipulate others, it will quickly become 
apparent, safety will be destroyed, and we'll be back to silence 
and violence in no time. Before you begin, examine your motive s. 
Ask yourself the Start with Heart questions: 
• What do I want for me? 
• What do I want for others? 
• What do I want for the relationship? 
Look for the mutualit y. Let's see how Mutual Purpose applies 
to a tough example-one where, at first glance, it might appear 
as if your purpose is to make things better for yourself. How can 
you find Mutual Pur pose in this? Let's say you've got a boss who 
frequently fails to keep commitme nts. How could you tell the 
boss you don't trust him? Surely there's no way to say this with­
out the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows 
that your goal is merely to make your life better. 
To avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so 
motivating to the boss that he'd want to hear your concerns. If 
your only reason for approaching the boss is to get what you 
want, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish-which is what 
you are. On the other hand, if you try to see the other person's 
point of view, you can often find a way to draw the other person 
willingly into even very sensitive conversations. For example, if 
the boss's behavior is causing you to miss deadlines he cares 
about, or incur costs he frets over, or lose productivity that he 
worries about, then you're onto a possible Mutual Purpose. 
Imagine raising the topic this way: "I've got some ideas for 
how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few 
thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It's going 
to be a bit of a sensitive conversation-but I think it will help a 
great deal if we can talk about it ." MAKE IT SAFE 71 
Mut ual Respect 
Will We Be Able to Remain in Dialogue? 
While it's true that there's no reason to enter a crucial conversaM 
tion if you don't have Mutual Purpose, it's equally true that you 
can't stay in the conversation if you don't maintain Mutual 
Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dia­
logue. As people perceive that others don't respect them, the 
conversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to 
a screeching halt. 
Why? Because respect is like air. If you take it away, it's all 
people can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect 
in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the origi· 
nal purpose-it is now about defending digni ty. 
For example, you're talking with a group of supervisors 
about a complicated quality problem. You really want to see 
the problem res olved once and for all. Your job depends on it. 
Unfortunately, you also think the supervisors are overpaid and 
underqualified. You firmly believe that not only are they in 
over their heads, but they do stu pid things all the time. Some 
of them even act unethically. 
As the supervisors throw out ideas, you roll your eyes. The dis .. 
respect you carry in your head creeps out in one unfortunate ges· 
ture. And it's all over. What happens to the conversation despite 
the fact that you still share a common objective? It tanks. They 
take shots at your proposals. You add insulting adjectives in 
describing theirs. As attention turns to scoring points, everyone 
loses. Your Mutual Purpose suffers for a lack of Mutual Respect . 
Tellta le signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes 
a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dig­
nity. Emotions are the key. When people feel disrespected, they 
become highly charged. Their emotions tum from fear to anger. 72 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making 
threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual 
Respect is at risk: 
• Do others believe I respect them? 
Ca n You Respec t Peo ple You Don' t Respec t? 
Some people fear they'll never be able to maintain Mutual 
Purpose or Mutual Respect with certain individuals or in certain 
circumstance s. How, they wonder, can they share the same pur­
pose with people who come from completely different back­
grounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do 
you do, for example, if you're upset because another person has 
let you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you 
respect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish? 
Yvonne is struggling with this exact point. There are times 
when she doesn't even like Jotham. She sees him as whiny and self­
centered. How can you speak respectfully with someone like that? 
Dialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every 
objective or respect every element of another person's character 
before we could talk. If this were the case, we'd all be mute. We 
can, however, stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and 
regard another person's basic humanity. In essence, feelings of 
disrespect often come when we dwell on how others are differ­
ent from ourselves. We can counteract these feelings by looking 
for ways we are similar. Without excusing their behavior, we try 
to sympathize, even empathize, with them. 
A rather clever person once hinted how to do this in the form 
of a prayer-"Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently 
than I." When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it's eas­
ier to find a way to respect others. When we do this, we feel a 
kinship, a sense of mutuality between ourselves and even the 
thorniest of people. It is this sense of kinship and connection to MAKE IT SAFE 73 
others that motivates us to enter tough conversations, and it 
eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone. 
Consider the following example. A manufacturing company has 
been out on strike for over six months. Finally, the union agrees to 
return to work, but the represented employees have to sign a con­
tract that is actually worse than what they were originally demand­
ing. The first day back it's clear that although people will work, 
they won't do so with a smile and a spring in their step. Everyone 
is furious. How are people ever going to move ahead? 
Concerned that although the strike is over, the battle isn't, a 
manager asks one of the authors to lend a hand. So he meets with 
the two groups of leaders (both managers and union heads) and 
asks them to do one thing. Each group is to go into a separate 
room and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized 
paper. For two hours each group feverishly lays out what it wants 
in the future and then tapes the lists to the wall. When they fin­
ish their assignment, the groups then swap places with the goal of 
finding anything-maybe just a morsel-but anything they might 
have in common. 
After a few minutes the two groups return to the training 
room. They're positively stunned. It was as if they had written 
the exact same lists. They didn't merely share the shadow of an 
idea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted 
a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality 
products, and a positive impact on the communi ty. Given a 
chance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group 
laid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every per­
son wanted. 
This experience caused each group to seriously question how 
it had seen the other side. The groups began to see others as 
morc simi lar to themselves. They realized the petty and political 
tactics thc others had used were embarrassin gly similar to the 74 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
ones they themselves had employed. The "sins" of others were 
different from their own more because of the role they played 
than because of a fundamental blight on their character. They 
restored Mutual Respect, and dialogue replaced silence and vio­
lence for the first time in decades . 
WHAT TO DO ONC E YOU STEP OUT 
When you see that either Mutual Respect or Purpose is at risk, 
we've suggested that you shouldn't ignore it. We've also argued 
that you should be able to find a way to both find Mutual 
Purpose and enjoy Mutual Respect -even with people who are 
enormously different. 
But how? What are you supposed to actually do? We've 
shared a few modest ideas (mostly things to avoid) , so let's get 
into three hard-hitting skills that the best at dialogue use: 
• Apologize 
• Contrast 
• CRIB 
Each skill helps rebuild either Mutual Respect or Mutual 
Purpose. First, we'll study them in action. Then, we'll see if they 
might help Yvonne get things back on track. 
Where were you ? You're talking with a group of hourly em­
ployees who worked all night preparing for a factory tour. You 
were supposed to bring the divisio n vice president by, and the 
team members were then going to update him on a new process 
they've put into place. They're proud of some improvements 
they've recently made-enoug h so that they willingly worked 
straight through the night to finish the last details. 
Unfortunately, when it came time to swing by their area, the 
visiting VP dropped a bomb. He laid out a plan you're convinced MAKE IT SAFE 75 
would hurt quality and potentially drive away your biggest cus­
tomers. Since you only had another hour with the VP, you chose 
to talk through the issue rather than conduct the tour. Your 
future depended on that particular conversation. Fortunately, 
you were able to avert the plan. Unfortunately, you forgot to get 
word to the team that had worked so hard. 
As you walked back to your office after escorting the execu­
tive to his car, you bumped into the team. Bleary-eyed and disap­
pointed, all six of them were now fuming. No visit, no phone 
call, and now it was clear from the way you were sprinting on by 
that you weren't even going to stop and give them a simple expla­
nation. 
Ouch. 
That's when things started turning ugly. "We pulled an all­
nighter, and you didn't even bother to come by! That's the last 
time we're busting our hump for you!" 
Time stands still. This con versation has just turned crucial. 
The employees who had worked so hard are obviously upset. 
They feel disrespected. 
But you miss that point. Why? Because now you feel disre­
spected. They've attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content 
of the conversation-thinking this has something to do with the 
factory tour. 
"I had to choose between the future of the company and the 
plant tour. 1 chose our future, and I'd do it again if 1 had to. " 
Now both you and they are fighting for respect. This is getting 
you nowhere fast. But what else could you do? 
Instead of getting hooked and fighting back, break the cycle. 
Sec their aggressive behavior for what it is-a sign of violated 
sa rety-then step out of the conversation, build safety, and step 
back into the content. Here's how. 76 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Apolog ize When Appropri ate 
When you've made a mistake that has hurt others (e.g., you didn't 
call the team) , start with an apology. An apology is a statement 
that sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing-or 
at least not preventing-pain or difficulty to others. 
''I'm sorry I didn't give you a call when I learned that we 
wouldn't be coming by. You worked all night, it would have 
been a wonderful chance to showcase your improvements, 
and I didn't even explain what happened. I apologize." 
Now, an apology isn't really an apology unless you experience a 
change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to 
change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning 
in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a 
bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, 
when you give up something you value, you're rewarded with 
something even more valuable-healthy dialogue and better 
results. Then watch to see if this sincere show of respect has 
helped restore safety. If it has, you can now explain the details of 
what happened. If it hasn't, you'll need to use one of the more 
advanced skills that follow in the next few pages. In any case, first 
make it safe; then return to the issue. 
When your behavior has given someone clear cause to doubt 
your respect or commitment to Mutual Purpose, your conversa­
tion will end up in silly game -playing and frustrating misunder­
standings until you offer a sincere apology. 
Contr ast to Fix Misund erst anding 
Sometimes others feel disrespected during crucial conversations 
even though we haven't done anything disrespectful. Sure, there 
are times when respect gets violated because we behave in clearly 
hurtful ways. But just as often, the insult is entirely unintended. MAKE IT SAFE 77 
The same can happen with Mutual Purpose. You can start by 
innocently sharing your views, but the other person believes your 
intention is to beat him or her up or coerce him or her into accept­
ing your opinion. Clearly an apology is not appropriate in these cir­
cumstances. It would be disingenuous to admit you were wrong 
when you weren't. Ho w, then, can you rebuild Mutual Purpose or 
Mutual Respect in order to make it safe to get back to dialogue? 
When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, 
step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called 
Cont rasting. 
Contrasting is a don'tldo statement that: 
• Addresses others' concerns that you don't respect them or that 
you have a malicious purpose (the don 't part) . 
• Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do 
part). 
For example: 
[The don't part] "The last thing I wanted to do was com­
municate that I don't value the work you put in or that I 
didn't want to share it with the VP. 
[The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of 
spectacular. " 
Now that you've addressed the threat to safety, you can return 
to the issue of the visit itself and move to remedi ation: 
"U nfortunately, just when I was starting to make the trip out 
here, an issue came up with the VP that I needed to address 
right then and there, or it could have cost us a huge piece of 
our business. I tell you what-I'll see if I can get him down 
here sometime tomorrow to review your work. He'll be here 
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Let's see if we can show off 
th e process impl'Ovcments you came up with." 78 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Of the two parts of Contrasting, the don 't is the more 
important because it deals with the misund erstanding that has 
put safety at risk. The employees who worked so hard are act­
ing on the belief that you don't appreciate thejr efforts and 
didn't care enough to keep them inform ed-when the opposite 
was true. So you address the misunderstanding by explaining 
what you don't intend. Once you've done this, and safety 
returns to the conversation, then you can explain what you do 
intend. Safety first. 
Let's go back to Yvonne and Jotham. Yvonne is trying to get 
the conversation going, and Jotham suspects her motives. Let's 
see how Contrasting might help her. 
YVONNE: I think it makes things worse when you withdraw 
and won't talk to me for days at a time. 
JOTHAM: SO you expect me not only to put up with regular 
rejection, but also to be sociable and happy when I do? 
Jotham appears to believe that Yvonne's motive is to reshape him. 
It's unsafe. Mutual Purpose is at risk. Rather than responding to 
his sarcasm, she should step out of the content and clarify her real 
motives. 
YVONNE: I don't want to suggest that this problem is yours. 
The truth is, I think it's ours. I'm not trying to put the 
burden on you. I don't even know what the solution is. 
What I do want is to be able to talk so that we can under­
stand each other better. Perhaps that will help me change 
how I'm responding to you, too. 
laTHAM: I know where this is going. We talk, I continue to 
get rejected, but you get to feel good about yourself 
because "we've communica ted." Have you been watching 
Oprah again? MAKE IT SAFE 79 
Obviously Jotham still believes that Yvonne merely wants to con­
firm that their existing relationship is okay and if she does, she'll 
be able to continue to reject Jotham-but feel good about it. 
lotham still feels unsafe. So Yvonne continues to step out and 
build safety, using Contrasting. 
YVONNE: Seriously, Honey. I'm not interested in discussing 
why our current relationship is really okay. I can see that 
it isn't. I merely want to talk about what each of us likes 
and doesn't like. That way we'll be able to see what we 
need to improve and why. My only goal is to come up 
with some ideas that will make both of us happy. 
JOTHAM: (Changing tone and demeanor) Really? I'm sorry 
to be so insecure about this. I know I'm being a bit selfish 
about things, but I don't know how to make myself feel 
differently. 
Cont rasting is not apologizing. It's important to understand 
that Contrasting is not apologizing. It is not a way of taking back 
something we've said that hurt others' feelings. Rather, it is a 
way of ensuring what we said didn't hurt more than it should 
have. Once Yvonne clarified her genuine goals (and not merely 
some trumped-up goal that appeals to lotham), lotham felt safer 
acknowledging his own contribution, and the two were back in 
dialogue. 
Cont rasting provides context and proportion. When we're in 
the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others hear what 
we're saying as bigger or worse than we intend. For example, you 
talk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality. When you 
share your concern, he appears crushed. 
At this point you could be tempted to water down your con­
lent-"You know it's really not that big a deal." Don't do it. 
Don't take back what you've said. Instead, put it in context. For 80 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
instance, at this point your assista nt may believe you are com­
pletely dissatisf ied with his performance. He believes that your 
view of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect 
for him. If this belief is incorrect, use Contrasting to clarify 
what you don't and do believe. Start with what you don't 
believe. 
"Let me put this in perspective. I don't want you to think 
I'm not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to 
continue working together. I really do think you're doing a 
good job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I'd 
just like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive 
to that, there are no other issues ." 
Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting is use­
ful both as a prevention and as first aid for safety problems. So 
far our examples have been of the first-a id type. Someone has 
taken something wrong, and we've intervened to clarify our true 
purpose or meaning. 
When we're aware that something we're about to drop into 
the pool of meaning could create a splash of defensiveness, we 
use Contrasting to bolster safety-even before we see others 
going to either silence or violence. 
"I don't want you to think that I don't appreciate the time 
you've taken to keep our checkbook balanced and up to 
date. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldn't have 
done nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns 
with how we're using the new electronic banking system." 
When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the 
misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you 
don't mean until you've restored safety. Then return to the 
conversation. Safety first. MAKE IT SAFE 81 
You Try 
Let's practice. Read the situations below and then come up with 
your own Contrasting statements. Remember, contrast what you 
don't want or intend with what you actually do want or intend. 
Say it in a way that helps make it safe for the other person. 
Angry roommate. You asked your roommate to move her 
things in the refrigerator off your shelves and onto her shelves. 
You thought it was no big deal, simply a request to share the 
space evenly. You have no hidden agenda. You like this roommate 
a great deal. She came back with: "There you go again, telling me 
how to run my life. I can't change the vacuum cleaner bag with­
out you jumping in and giving me advice." 
Formulate a Contrasting statement. 
I don't want __________________ _ 
I do want ___________________ _ 
Touchy employee. You're about to talk to Jacob, an employee 
who continually blows up when people try to give him feedback. 
Yesterday a coworker told Jacob that she'd prefer it if he would 
clean up after himself in the lunchroom (something that every­
one else does), and Jacob blew up. You've decided to say some­
thing. Of course, you'll be giving him feedback, and that's what 
usually sets him off, so you'll need to be careful up front. You'll 
want to set the right tone and lay out the context carefully. After 
all, you like Jacob a lot. Everyone does. He has a great sense of 
humor and is the most competent and hard-working employee 
around. If he could only be less touchy.

Chatty teenager. Your teenage nephew moved in with you

things have been going well except in one area: He spends hours 
on the phone and Internet-most of his waking hours. In light of 
what he could be doing, you're not really dis turbed, but it has 
been hard for you to make calls and check your email. You said 
something to him about cutting back his time on the phone and 
online, and he came back with: "Please don't send me to a youth

don't send me away."

CRIB TO GET TO MUTUAL PURPOSE 
Let's add one more skill. Sometimes we find ourselves in the 
middle of a debate because we clearly have different purposes. 
There is no misunderstanding here. Contrasting won't do the 
trick. We need something sturdier for this job. 
For instance, you've just been offered a promotion that will 
help propel your career along a faster track and bring you a great 
deal more authority, and it pays enough to help soften the blow 
of displacement. That last part is important because you'll have 
to move the family across the country and your spouse and kids 
love where you currently live. 
You expected your spouse to have feelings of ambivalence 
over the move, but he or she doesn't seem to be bivaling even a 
tiny bit. To your spouse the promotion is a bad news/bad news 
event. First, you have to move, and second, you'll work even MAKE IT SAFE 83 
longer hours . That whole thing about more money and power 
doesn't seem to be compensating. Now what? 
The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push 
ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for 
either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making 
winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the 
initial conversation. 
The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. 
For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house­
holds-one where one spouse will be working and one where 
the family currently lives . Nobody really wants this arrangement, 
and frankly, it's a pretty ugly solution that's bound to lead to 
more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is 
sometimes necessary, the best know better than to start there. 
The best at dialogue use four skills to look for a Mutual Purpose. 
The four skills they use form the acronym CRIB . 
.commi t to Seek Mutual Purpose 
As is true with most dialogue skill s, if you want to get back to dia­
logue, you have to Start with Heart. In this case, you have to agree 
to agree. To be successful, we have to stop using silence or vio­
lence to compel others to our view. We must even surrender false 
dialogue, where we pretend to have Mutual Purpose (calmly argu­
ing our side until the other person gives in) . We Start with Heart 
by committing to stay in the conversation until we come up with 
a solution that serves a purpose we both share. 
This can be tough. To stop arguing, we have to suspend our 
beli ef that our choice is the absolute best and only one, and that 
we'll never be happy until we get exactly what we currently 
want. We have to open our mind to the fact that maybe, just 
maybe, there is a different choice out there-one that suits 
everyone. 84 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
We also have to be willing to verbalize this commitment even 
when our partner seems committed to winning. We act on faith 
that our partner is stuck in silence or violence because he or she 
feels unsafe. We assume that if we build more safety-by 
demonstrating our commitment to finding a Mutual Purpose­
the other person will feel more confident that dialogue could be 
a productive avenue. 
So next time you find yourself stuck in a battle of wills, try this 
amazingly powerful but simple skill. Step out of the content of 
the struggle and make it safe. Simply say, "It seems like we're 
both trying to force our view. I commit to stay in this discussion 
until we have a solution both of us are happy with." Then watch 
whether safety takes a turn for the better . 
.Recogni ze the Purpose be hind the Strategy 
Wanting to come up with a shared goal is a wonderful first step, 
but it's not enough. Once we've had a change of heart, we need 
to change our strategy. Here's the problem we have to fix: When 
we find ourselves at an impas se, it's because we're asking for one 
thing and the other person is asking for something else. We think 
we'll never find a way out because we equate what we're asking 
for with what we want. In truth, what we're asking for is the 
strategy we're suggesting to get what we want. We confuse wants 
or purpose with strategies. That's the problem. 
For example, I come home from work and say that I want to 
go to a movie. You say that you want to stay home and relax. 
And so we debate: movie, TV, movie, read, etc. We figure we'll 
never be able to resolve our differences because going out and 
staying home are incompatible. 
In such circumstances we can break the impas se by asking 
others, "Why do you want that?" In this case, MAKE IT SAFE 85 
"Why do you want to stay home?" 
"Because I'm tired of running around and dealing with the 
hassle of the city." 
"So you want peace and qui et?" 
"Mostl y. And why do you want to go to a movie?" 
"So I can spend some time with you away from the kids ." 
Before you can agree on a Mutual Purpose, you must know 
what people's real purposes are. So step out of the content of the 
conversatio n-which is generally focused on strategies-a nd 
explore the purposes behind them. 
When you do this, new options become possible. When you 
release your grip on your strategy and focus on your real pur­
pose, you open up the possibility of finding new alternatives that 
can serve Mutual Purpose. 
"You want peace and quiet, and I want time with you away 
from the kids . So if we can come up with something that is 
quiet and away, we'll both be happy. Is that right?" 
"Absolu tely. What if we were to take a drive up the 
canyon and ... " 
Invent a Mutual Purpose 
Sometimes when we recognize the purposes behind our strategies, 
we discover that we actually have compatible goals. From there 
you simply come up with common strategies. But we're not always 
so lucky. For example, you find out that your genuine wants and 
goals cannot be served except at the expense of the other person's. 
In this case you cannot discover a Mutual Purpose, so you must 
actively invent one. 
To invent a Mutual Purpose, move to more encompassing goals. 
Find an objective that is more meaningful or more rewarding than 86 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
the ones that divide the various sides . For instance, you and your 
spouse may not agree on whether or not you should take the pro­
motion, but you can agree that the needs of your relationship 
and the children come before career aspiratio ns. By focusing on 
higher and longer-term goals, you can find a way to transcend 
short-term compromises, build Mutual Purpose, and get to dia­
logue. 
Ilrains torm New Strateg ies 
Once you've built safety by finding a shared purpose, you should 
now have enough safety to return to the content of the conver­
sation. It's time to step back into the dialogue and brainstorm 
strategies that meet everyone's needs. If you've committed to 
finding something everyone can agree on, and surfaced what you 
really want, you'll no longer be spending your energy on unpro­
ductive conflict. Instead, you'll be actively coming up with 
options that can serve everyone. 
Suspend judgment and think outside the box for new alterna­
tives . Can you find a way to work in a job that is local and still 
meets your career goals? Is this job with this company the only 
thing that will make you happy? Is a move really necessary in 
this new job? Is there another community that could offer your 
family the same benefits? If you're not willing to give creativity 
a try, it'll be impossible for you to jointly come up with a mutu­
ally acceptable option. If you are, the sky's the limit. 
CRIB to Get to Mutual Purpose 
So when you sense that you and others are working at cross­
purposes, here's what you can do. First, step out of the content 
of the conflict. Stop focusing on who thinks what. Then CRIB 
your way to Mutual Purpose. MAKE IT SAFE 87 
• Qommit to seek Mutual Purpose. Make a unilateral public 
commitment to stay in the conversation until you come up 
with something that serves everyone. 
"This isn 't working. Your team is arguing to stay late and 
work until we're done, and my team wants to go home and 
come back on the weekend. Why don't we see if we can come 
up with something that satisfies everyone?" 
• Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Ask people why 
they want what they're pushing for. Separate what they're 
demanding from the purpose it serves. 
"Exactly why don 't you want to come in Saturday morning? 
We're feeling fatigued and are worried about safety issues and 
a loss of qual ity. Why do you want to stay late? " 
• Invent a Mutual Purpose. If after clarifying everyone's pur­
poses you are still at odds, see if you can invent a higher or 
longer-term purpose that is more motivating than the ones 
that keep you in conflict. 
"I certainly don 't want to make winn ers and losers here. It's 
far better if we can come up with something that doesn 't make 
one team resent the other one. We've voted before or flipped a 
coin, and the losers just ended up resenting the winne rs. I'm 
more worried about how we feel about each other than any­
thing else. Let's make sure that whatever we do, we don't 
drive a wedge in our working relationship. " 
• B.rainstorm new strategies. With a clear Mutual Purpose, you 
can join forces in searching for a solution that serves everyone. 
"So we need to come up with something that doesn't jeopard­
ize safety and quality and allows your team to attend their col­
league's wedding on Saturday. My team members don't care

over from there? That way we'll be able ... " 
BACK TO YVO NNE AND JOTHAM 
Let's end where we started. Yvonne is going to try to move to 
dialogue with Jotham. Let's see how she does at making it safe in 
her crucial conversation. First, she'll use Contrasting to prevent 
misunderstanding of her purpose. 
YVONNE: Jotham, I'd like to talk about our physical relation­
ship. I'm not doing it to put you on the spot or to suggest 
the problem is yours. I'm completely clear that it's as 
much my problem as yours. I'd really like to talk about 
it so we can make things better for both of us. 
JOTHAM: What's there to talk about? You don't want it. I 
want it. I'll try to deal with it. 
YVONNE: I think it's more complicated than that. The way 
you act sometimes makes me want to be with you even less. 
JOTHAM: If that's how you feel, why are we pretending we 
have a relationship at all? 
Ok ay, what just happened? Remember, we're exploring 
Yvonne's side of the con versation. She's the one initiating the 
talk. Clearly there's a lot Jotham could be doing to make things go 
better. But she's not Jotham. What should Yvonne do? She should 
focus on what she really wants: to find a way to make things bet­
ter for both of them. Consequently, she shouldn't respond to the 
content of Jotham's discouraging statement. Rather, she should 
look at the safety issue behind it. Why is Jotham starting to with­
draw from the conversation? Two reasons: 
• The way Yvonne made her point sounded to him like she was 
blaming him for everything. MAKE IT SAFE 89 
• He believes her concern in one small area reflects her total 
feelings toward him. 
So she'll apologize and use Contrasting to rebuild safety. 
YVONNE: I'm sorry I said it that way. I'm not blaming you 
for how I feel or act. That's my problem. I don't see this 
as your problem. I see it as our problem. Both of us may 
be acting in ways that make things worse. I know I am at 
least. 
laTHAM: I probably am too. Sometimes I pout because I'm 
hurting. And I also do it hoping it'll make you feel bad. 
I'm sorry about that, too. 
Notice what just happened. Since Yvonne dealt well with the 
safety issue and kept focused on what she really wanted out of 
this conversation, Jotham returned to the conversation. This is 
far more effective than if Yvonne had gone into blaming. 
Let's continue. 
JOTHAM: I ju st don't see how we can work this out. I'm 
wired for more passion than you are-it seems like the 
only solution is for me to put up with it the way it is or 
for you to feel like a sex slave. 
The problem now is one of Mutual Purpose. Jotham thinks he 
and Yvonne are at cross-pur poses. In his mind, there is no pos­
sib ility of a mutually sati sfactory solution. Rather than move to 
compromise or fight for her way, Yvonne will step out of the 
issue and CRIB to get to Mutual Purpose. 
YVONNE: [Commit to seek Mutual Purpose] No, that isn't 
what I want at all. I don't want anything with you that 
isn't great for both of us. I ju st want to find a way to have 
us both feel close. appreciated. and loved. 90 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
laTHAM: That's what I want, too. It just seems like we get 
those feelings in different ways . 
(Notice how lotham is leaving the game behind and joining 
the dialogue. Safety-specifically Mutual Purpose-is making 
this possible .) 
YVONNE: [Recognize the purpose behind the strategy] Maybe 
not. What makes you feel loved and appreciated? 
laTHAM: Making love with you when you really want to 
makes me feel loved and appreci ated. And you? 
YVONNE: When you do thoughtful things for me. And, I 
guess, when you hold me-but not always sexually . 
laTHAM: You mean, if we're just cuddling that makes you 
feel loved? 
YVONNE: Yes. And sometimes-I guess when I think 
you're doing it because you love me-sex does that for 
me, too. 
JOTHAM: [Invent a Mutual Purpose] So we need to find 
ways to be together that make both of us feel loved and 
appreciated. Is that what we're looking for here? 
YVONNE: Yes. I really want that, too. 
laTHAM: [Brainstorm new strategies] Well, what if we ... 
BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT! 
Reading a complicated interaction like this one might lead to two 
reactions. First, you might think, "Wow, these ideas could actu­
ally work!" And at the same time, you could be thinking, "But 
there's no way I could think that clearly in the middle of that 
kind of delicate conversation !" MAKE IT SAFE 91 
We admit that it's pretty easy for us to put all the skills together 
when we're sitting at a computer typing a script. But the good 
news is, that's not where these examples came from. They came 
from real experiences. People do act like this all the time. In fact, 
you do on your best days. 
So don't overwhelm yourself by asking whether you could 
think this clearly during every heated and emotional conver­
sation. Merely consider whether you could think a little more 
clearly during a few crucial conversations. Or prepare in advance. 
Be fore a crucial conversation begins, think about which skills will 
help you most. Remember, when it comes to these high-stakes 
conversations, a little progress can produce a lot of benefit. 
Finally , as is the case with most complicated problems, don't 
aim for perfection. Aim for progress. Learn to slow the process 
down when your adrenaline gets pumping. Carry a few of the 
questions we're suggesting with you as you go. Pick the ones that 
you think are most relevant to the topic at hand. And watch 
yourself get better a little at a time. 
SUM MARY- MAKE IT SAFE 
Step Out

versation and Make It Safe. When safety is restored, go back to 
the issue at hand and continue the dialogue.

How to Stay in Dialogue When 
You're Angr}'t Scared, or Hurt 
At this point you may be saying to yourself, "How am I supposed 
to remember to do all this stuff-esp ecially when my emotions 
are raging like hot magma?" 
This chapter explores how to gain control of crucial conver­
sations by learning how to take charge of your emotions. By 
learning to exert influence over your own feelings, you'll place 
yourself in a far better position to use all the tools we've 
explored thus far. 
HE MADE ME MAD ! 
How many times have you heard someone say: "He made me 
mad!" ,? How many times have you said it? For instance, you're 94 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
sitting quietly at home watching TV and your mother-in-law (who 
lives with you) walks in. She glances around and then starts pick­
ing up the mess you made a few minutes earlier when you 
whipped up a batch of nachos. This ticks you off. She's always 
smugly skulking around the house, thinking you're a slob. 
A few minutes later when your spouse asks you why you're so 
upset, you explain, "It's your mom again . I was lying here enjoy­
ing myself when she gave me that look, and it really got me 
going. To be honest, I wish she would quit doing that. It' s my 
only day off, I'm relaxing quiet ly, and then she walks in and 
pushes my buttons." 
"Does she push your buttons?" your spouse asks. "Or do 
you?" 
That's an interesting question. 
One thing's for certain. No matter who is doing the button 
pushing, some people tend to react more explosively than others­
and to the same stimulus, no less. Why is that? For instance, what 
enables some people to listen to withering feedback without flin­
ching, whereas others pitch a fit when you tell them they've got a 
smear of salsa on their chin? Why is it that sometimes you your­
self can take a verbal blow to the gut without batting an eye, but 
other times you go ballistic if someone so much as looks at you 
sideways? 
EMOTIONS DON' T JUST HAPPEN 
To answer these questions, we'll start with two rather bold (and 
sometimes unpopular) claims. Then, having tipped our hand, we'll 
explain the logic behind each claim. 
Claim One. Emotions don't settle upon you like a fog. They 
are not foisted upon you by others . No matter how comfortable 
it might make you feel saying it-others don't make you mad. 
You make you mad. You and only you create your emotions. MASTER MY STORIES 95 
Claim Two. Once you've created your emotions, you have only 
two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That 
is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to 
master them or fall hostage to them. 
Here's how this all unfolds. 
MARIA'S STORY 
Consider Maria, a copywriter who is currently hostage to some 
pretty strong emotions. She and her colleague Louis just 
reviewed the latest draft of a proposal with their boss. During 
the meeting, they were supposed to be jointly presenting their 
latest ideas. But when Maria paused to take a breath, Louis took 
over the presentation, making almost all the points they had 
come up with together. When the boss turned to Maria for input, 
there was nothing left for her to say. 
Maria has been feeling humiliated and angry throughout this 
project. First, Louis took their suggestions to the boss and dis­
cussed them behind her back. Second, he completely monopo­
lized the presentation. Consequentl y, Maria believes that Louis is 
downplaying her contribution because she's the only woman on 
the team. 
She's getting fed up with his "boys' club" mentality. So what 
does she do? She doesn't want to appear "oversensitive ," so most 
of the time she says nothing and just does her job. However, she 
does manage to assert herself by occasionally getting in sarcastic 
jabs about the way she's being treated. 
"Sure I can get that printout for you. Should I just get your 
coffee and whip up a bundt cake while I'm at it?" she mutters, 
and rolls her eyes as she exits the room. 
Louis, in tum, finds Maria's cheap shots and sarcasm puz­
zling. He's not sure what has Maria upset but is beginning to 
despis e her smug attitude and hostile reaction to most everything 96 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
he does. As a result, when the two work together, you could cut 
the tension with a knife. 
What's Making Maria Mad? 
The worst at dialogue fall into the trap Maria has fallen into. 
Maria is completely unaware of a dangerous assumption she's 
making. She's upset at being overlooked and is keeping a pro­
fessional silence. She's assuming that her emotions and behavior 
are the only right and reasonable reactions under the circum­
stances. She's convinced that anyone in her place would feel the 
same way. 
Here's the problem. Maria is treating her emotions as if they are 
the only valid response. Since, in her mind, they are both justified 
and accurate, she makes no effort to change or even question 
them. In fact, in her view, Louis caused them. Ultimately, her 
actions (saying nothing and taking cheap shots) are being driven 
by these very emotions. Since she's not acting on her emotions, her 
emotions are acting on her-controlling her behavior and driving 
her deteriorating relationship with Louis. The worst at dialogue 
are hostages to their emotions, and they don't even know it. 
The good at dialogue realize that if they don't control their 
emotions, matters will get worse. So they try something else. 
They fake it. They choke down reactions and then do their best 
to get back to dialogue. At least, they give it a shot. 
Unfortunately, once they hit a rough spot in a crucial conver­
sation, their suppressed emotions come out of hiding. They show 
up as tightened jaws or sarcastic comments. Dialogue takes a hit. 
Or maybe their paralyzing fear causes them to avoid saying what 
they really think. Meaning is cut off at the source. In any case, 
their emotions sneak out of the cubbyhole they've been crammed 
into and find a way into the conversation. It's never pretty, and 
it always kills dialogue. MASTER MY STORIES 97 
The best at dialogue do something completely different. They 
aren't held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or 
suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when 
they have strong feelings, they influence (and often change) their 
emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their 
emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors 
that create better results. 
This, of course, is easier said than done. How do you rethink 
yourself from an emotional and dangerous state into one that 
puts you back in control? 
Where should Maria start? To help rethink or gain control of 
our emotions, let's see where our feelings come from in the first 
place. Let's look at a model that helps us first examine and then 
gain control of our own emotions. 
Consider Maria. She's feeling hurt but is worried that if she 
says something to Louis, she'll look too emotional, so she alter­
nates between holding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking 
cheap shots (maskin g). 
As Figure 6-1 demonstrates, Maria's actions stem from her feel­
ings. First she feels and then she acts. That's easy enough, but it 
Feel --...... Act 
hurt sil ence

shots 
Figure 6-1. How Feelings Drive Actions 98 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
begs the question: What's causing Maria's feelings in the first 
place? 
Is it Louis's behavior? As was the case with the nacho-mother­
in-l aw, did Louis make Maria feel insulted and hurt? Maria 
heard and saw Louis do something, she generated an emotion, 
and then she acted out her feelings-using forms of masking and 
avoiding. 
So here's the big question: What happens between Louis act­
ing and Maria feeling? Is there an intermediate step that turns 
someone else's actions into our feelings? If not, then it has to be 
true that others make us feel the way we do. 
Sto ries Create Feelings 
As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what oth­
ers do and how we feel. That's why, when faced with the same 
circumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional 
responses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might 
feel insulted whereas others merely feel curiou s. Some become 
angry and others feel concern or even sympathy. 
What is this intermedia te step? Just after we observe what 
others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell 
ourselves a story. That is, we add meaning to the action we 
observed. To the simple behavior we add motive. Why were they 
doing that? We also add judgment- is that good or bad? And 
then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with 
an emotion. 
Pictorially it looks like the model in Figure 6-2. We call this 
model our Path to Action because it explains how emotions, 
thoughts, and experiences lead to our actions. 
You'll note that we've added telling a story to our model. We 
observe, we tell a story, and then we feel. Although this addition 
complicates things a bit, it also gives us hope. Since we and only See! Tell a Feel Hear ---.... Story --.... 
Figure 6-2. The Path to Action 
MASTER MY STORIES 99 
we are telling the story, we can take back control of our own 
emotions by telling a different story. We now have a point of 
leverage or control. If we can find a way to control the stories we 
tell, by rethinking or retelling them, we can master our emotions 
and, therefore, master our crucial conversations. 
OUR STORIES 
"Nothing in this world is good or bad, 
but thinking makes it so. " 
-WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
Stories explain what's going on. Exactly what are our stories? 
They are our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what 
we see and hear. They're theories we use to explain why, how, 
and what. For instance, Maria asks: "Why does Louis take over? 
li e doesn't trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that 
because I'm a woman, people won't listen to me." 
Our stories also help explain how. "How am I supposed to 
ju uge all of this? Is this a good or a bad thing? Louis thinks I'm 
incompetent. and this is bad." 10 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Finally , a story might also include what. "What should I do 
about all this? If I say something, he'll think I'm a whiner or 
oversensitive or militant, so it's best to clam up." 
Of course, as we come up with our own meaning or stories, it 
isn't long until our body responds with strong feelings or emo­
tions-they're directly linked to our judgments of right/wrong, 
good/bad, kind/selfish, fair/unfair, etc. Maria's story yields anger 
and frustration. These feelings, in turn, drive Maria to her 
actions-tog gling back and forth between clamming up and tak­
ing an occasional cheap shot (see Figure 6-3). 
Even if you don't realize it, you are telling yourself stories. 
When we teach people that it's our stories that drive our emotions 
and not other people's actions, someone inevitably raises a hand 
and says, "Wait a minute! I didn't notice myself telling a story. 
When that guy laughed at me during my presentation, I just felt 
angry. The feelings came first; the thoughts came second." 
Storytelling typically happens blindingly fast. When we 
believe we're at risk, we tell ourselves a story so quickly that we 
don't even know we're doing it. If you don't believe this is true, 
ask yourself whether you always become angry when someone

laughs at you. If sometimes you do and sometimes you don't, 
then your response isn 't hardwired . That means something goes 
on between others laughing and you feeling. In truth, you tell a 
story. You may not remember it, but you tell a story. 
Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of sto­
ries. Stories are just that, stories. These fabrications could be 
told in any of thousands of different ways . For instance, Maria 
could just as easily have decided that Louis didn't realize she 
cared so much about the project. She could have concluded that 
Louis was feeling unimportant and this was a way of showing he 
was valuable. Or maybe he had been burned in the past because 
he hadn't personally seen through every detail of a project. Any 
of these stories would have fit the facts and would have created 
very different emotions. 
If we take control of our stories, they won 't control us. People 
who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during 
crucial conversations. They recognize that while it's true that at 
first we are in control of the stories we tell-a fter all, we do make 
them up of our own accord-once they're told, the stories con­
trol us. They control how we feel and how we act. And as a result, 
they control the results we get from our crucial conversations . 
But it doesn't have to be this way. We can tell different stories 
and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we 
cannot break the loop. 
If you want improved results from your crucial conversations, 
change the stories you tell yourself- even while you're in the 
middle of the fray. 
SKi llS FOR MASTERING OUR STORIES 
What's the most effective way to come up with different stories? 
The best at dialogue find a way to first slow down and then take 
charge of their Path to Action. Here's how. 10 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Retrace Your Path 
To slow down the lightning-quick storytelling process and the 
subseq uent flow of adrenaline, retrace your Path to Action-one 
element at a time. This calls for a bit of mental gymnastics. First 
you have to stop what you're currently doing. Then you have to 
get in touch with why you're doing it. Here's how to retrace your 
path: 
• [Act] Notice your behavior. Ask: 
Am I in some form of silence or violence? 
• [Feel] Get in touch with your feelings. 
What emotions are encouraging me to act this way? 
• [Tell story] Analyze your stories. 
What story is creating these emotions? 
• [See/hear] Get back to the facts. 
What evidence do I have to support this story? 
By retracing your path one element at a time, you put yourself 
in a position to think about, question, and change any one or 
more of the elements. 
No tice Your Beha vior 
Why would you stop and retrace your Path to Action in the first 
place? Certainly if you're constantly stopping what you're doing 
and looking for your underlying motive and thoughts, you won't 
even be able to put on your shoes without thinking about it for 
who knows how long. You'll die of analysis paralysi s. 
Actually, you shouldn't constantly stop and question your 
actions. If you Learn to Look (as we suggested in Chapter 4) and 
note that you yourself are slipping into silence or violence, you 
have good reason to stop and take stock. MASTER MY STORIES 10 3 
But looking isn't enough. You must take an honest look at 
what you're doing. If you tell yourself a story that your violent 
behavior is a "necessary tactic," you won't see the need to recon­
sider your actions. If you immediately jump in with "they started 
it," or otherwise find yourself rationalizing your behavior, you 
also won't feel compelled to change. Rather than stop and review 
what you're doing, you'll devote your time to justifying your 
actions to yourself and others . 
When an unhelpful story is driving you to silence or violence, 
stop and consider how others would see your actions. For exam­
ple, if the 60 Minu tes camera crew replayed this scene on 
national television, how would you look? What would they tell 
about your behavior? 
Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice 
when they're slipping into silence or violence, but they are also 
able to admit it. They don't wallow in self-doubt, of course, but 
they do recognize the problem and begin to take corrective 
action. The moment they realize that they're killing dialogue, 
they review their own Path to Action. 
Get In Touch wi th Your Feelings 
As skilled individuals begin to retrace their own Path to Action, 
they immediately move from examining their own unhealthy 
behavior to exploring their feelings or emotions. At first glance 
this task sounds easy. "I'm angry!" you think to yourself. What 
could be easier? 
Actual ly, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you 
might imagine . In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. 
When asked to describe how they're feeling, they use words such 
as "bad" or "angry" or "frightened"-which would be okay if 
these were accurate descriptors, but often they're not. 
Individ uals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a mix 
01' embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they're unhappy 10 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
when they're feeling viola ted. Perhaps they suggest they're upset 
when they're really feeling humiliated and cheated. 
Since life doesn't consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you 
might wonder what difference words can make. But words do 
matter. Knowing what you're really feeling helps you take a more 
accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you're 
far more likely to take an honest look at the story you're telling 
yourself if you admit you're feeling both embarra ssed and sur­
prised rather than simply angry. 
How about you? When experiencing strong emotions, do you 
stop and think about your feelin gs? If so, do you use a rich 
vocabular y, or do you mostly draw from terms such as "bummed 
out" and "furious"? Second, do you talk openly with others 
about how you feel? Do you willingly talk with loved ones about 
what's going on inside of you? Third, in so doing, is your vocab­
ulary robust and accurate? 
It's important to get in touch with your feelings, and to do so, 
you may want to expand your emotional vocabu lary. 
Ana lyze Your Storie s 
Question your feelings and stories. Once you've identified what 
you're feeling, you have to stop and ask, given the circum­
stances, is it the right feeling? Meaning, of course, are you telling 
the right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories 
are our own invention. 
The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge 
the illusion that what you're feeling is the only right emotion 
under the circumstances. This may be the hardest step, but it's 
also the most important one. By questioning our feelings, we 
open ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the com­
fortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly 
question whether our emotions (very real) , and the story behind 
them (only one of many possible explanations) , are accu rate. MASTER MY STORIES 10 5 
For instance, what were the facts in Maria's story? She saw 
Louis give the whole presentation. She heard the boss talk about 
meeting with Louis to discuss the project when she wasn't pres­
ent. That was the beginning of Maria's Path to Action. 
Don 't confuse stories with facts. Sometimes you fail to ques­
tion your stories because you see them as immutable facts. When 
you generate stories in the blink of an eye, you can get so caught 
up in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. 
They feel like facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with 
steel-hard data points. For example, in trying to ferret out facts 
from story, Maria might say, "H e's a male chauvini st pig-t hat's 
a fact ! Ask anyone who has seen how he treats me !" 
"He's a male chauvinist pig" is not a fact. It's the story that 
Maria created to give meaning to the facts. The facts could mean 
just about anything. As we said earlier, others could watch Maria's 
interactions with Louis and walk away with different stories. 
Get Back to the Facts 
Separate fact from story by focusing on behavior. To separate 
fact from story, get back to the genuine source of your feelings . 
Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear 
this thing you're calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior? 
For example, it is a fact that Louis "gave 95 percent of the pre­
sentation and answered all but one question." This is specific, 
objective, and verifiable. Any two people watching the meeting 
would make the same observation. However, the statement "He 
doesn't trust me" is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not 
what the other person did. Conclusions are subjective. 
Spot the story by watching for "hot" words. Here's another tip. 
To avoid confusing story with fact, watch for "hot" terms. For 
cxample, when assessing the facts, you might say, "She scowled at 
mc" or "He made a sarcastic comment." Words such as "scowl" 
anu "sarcastic" are hot terms. They express judgments and attribu-10 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
tions that, in turn, create strong emotions. They are story, not fact. 
Notice how much different it is when you say: "Her eyes pinched 
shut and her lips tightened," as opposed to "She scowled at me." In 
Maria's case, she suggested that Louis was controlling and didn't 
respect her. Had she focused on his behavior (he talked a lot and 
met with the boss one-on-one) , this less volatile description would 
have allowed for any number of interpretations. For example, per­
haps Louis was nervous, concerned, or unsure of himself. 
Watch for Three "Clever" Stories 
As we begin to piece together why people are doing what they're 
doing (or equally important, why we're doing what we're doing) , 
with time and experience we become quite good at coming up 
with explanations that serve us well. Either our stories are com­
pletely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they're 
quite inaccurate but ju stify our current behavior-making us feel 
good about ourselves and calling for no need to change. 
It's the second kind of story that routinely gets us into trouble. 
For example, we move to silence or violence , and then we come 
up with a perfectly plausible reason for why it's okay. "Of course 
I yelled at him. Did you see what he did? He deserved it." "Hey, 
don't be gi"ing me the evil eye. I had no other choice." We call 
these imaginative and self-serving concoctions "clever stories." 
They're clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving 
badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly 
even while achieving abysmal result s. 
Among all of the clever stories we tell, here are the three most 
common. 
Victim Stories -lilt's Not My Fault" 
The first of the clever stories is a Victim Story. Vi ctim Stories, as 
you might imagine, make us out to be innocent sufferers. The 
theme is always the same. The other person is bad and wrong, MASTER MY STORIES 10 7 
and we are good and rig ht. Other people do bad things, and we 
suffer as a result. 
In truth, there is such a thing as an innocent victim. You're 
stopped in the street and held up at gunpoint. When an event 
such as this occurs, it's a sad fact, not a story. You are a victim. 
But all tales of victimization are not so one-sided. When you 
tell a Victim Story, you ignore the role you played in the prob­
lem. You tell your story in a way that ju diciously avoids facts 
about whatever you have done (or neglected to do) that might 
have contributed to the problem. 
For insta nce, last week your boss took you off a big project, 
and it hurt your feelings . You complained to everyone about 
how bad you felt. Of course, you failed to let your boss know 
that you were behind on an important project, leaving him 
high and dry-which is why he removed you in the first place. 
This part of the story you leave out because, hey, he made you 
feel bad. 
To help support your Vi ctim Stories you speak of nothing but 
your noble motives. "I took longer because I was trying to beat 
the standard specs." Then you tell yourself that you're being pun­
ished for your virtues, not your vice s. "He just doesn't appreci­
ate a person with my superb attention to detail." (This added 
twist turns you from victim into martyr. What a bonus !) 
Villain Stories -"It's All Your Fault" 
We create these nasty little tales by turning normal, decent 
human beings into villains. We impute bad motive, and then we 
tell everyone about the evils of the other party as if somehow 
we 're doing the world a huge favor. 
For example, we describe a boss who is zealous about quality 
liS a control freak. When our spouse is upset that we didn't keep 
a c om mi tment, we see him or her as inflexible and stubborn. 
In Victim Stor ies we eX�lggcrate our own innocence. In Vi llain 1 08 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Stories we overemphasize the other person's guilt. We automatical­
ly assume the worst possible motives while ignoring any possible 
good or neutral intentions a person may have. Labeling is a common 
device in Villain Stories. For example, "I can't believe that bonehead 
gave me bad materials again." By employing the handy label, we are 
now dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead. 
Not only do Vi llain Stories help us blame others for bad 
results, but they also set us up to then do whatever we want to 
the "villai ns." After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a 
bonehead-whereas we might have to be more careful with a 
living, breathing person. Then when we fail to get the results we 
really want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, 
after all, look who we're dealing with! 
Watch for the double standard. When you pay attention to 
Vi ctim and Vi llain Stories and catch them for what they are­
unfair characterizations-you begin to see the terrible double 
standard we use when our emotions are out of control. When we 
make mistak es, we tell a Vi ctim Story by claiming our intentions 
were innocent and pure. "Sure 1 was late getting home and didn't 
call you, but I couldn't let the team down!" On the other hand, 
when others do things that hurt us, we tell Vi llain Stories in 
which we invent terrible motives for others based on how their 
actions affected us. "You are so thoughtless! You could have 
called me and told me you were going to be late." 
Helpless Stories- "There's Nothing Else I Can Do" 
Finally come Helpless Stories. In these fabrications we make our­
selves out to be powerless to do anything. We convince ourselves 
that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predica­
ment, which justifies the action we're about to take. A Helpless 
Story might suggest, "If 1 didn't yell at my son, he wouldn't listen." 
Or on the flip side, "If I told my husband this, he would just be MASTER MY STORIES 10 9 
defensive." While Villian and Victim Stories look back to explain 
why we're in the situation we're in, Helpless Stories look forward 
to explain why we can't do anything to change our situation. 
It's particu larly easy to act helpless when we tum others' 
behavior into fixed and unchangeable traits. For example, when 
we decide our boss is a "control freak" (Villain Story), we are 
less inclined to give him feedback because, after all, control 
freaks like him don't accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing 
we can do will change that fact. 
As you can see, Helpl ess Stories often stem from Villain Stories 
and typically offer us nothing more than Sucker's Choices. 
Why We Tell Clever Stories 
They match reality. Sometimes the stories we tell are accurate. 
The other person is trying to cause us harm, we are innocent vic­
tims, or maybe we really can't do much about the problem. It can 
happen. It' s not common, but it can happen. 
They get us off the hook. More often than not, our conclusions 
transform from reasonable explanations to clever stories when 
they conveniently excuse us from any responsibility-when, in 
reali ty, we have been partially responsible. The other person isn't 
bad and wrong, and we aren't right and good. The truth lies 
somewhere in the middle . However, if we can make others out 
as wrong and ourselves out as right, we're off the hook. Better 
yet, once we've demonized others, we can even insult and abuse 
them if we want. 
Clever stories keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts. 
By now it should be clear that clever stories cause us problems. 
A reasonable question at this point is, "If they're so terribly hurt­
ful, why do we ever tell clever stories?" 
Our need to tell clever stories often starts with our own sellouts. 
l, ike it or not, we usually don't begin telling stories that jus tify our 
ad ions until we have done something that we feel a need to 11 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
just ify. 1 
We sell out when we consciously act against our own sense of 
what's right. And after we've sold out, we have only two choices: 
own up to our sellout, or try to jus tify it. And if we don't admit 
to our errors, we inevitably look for ways to justify them. That's 
when we begin to tell clever stories. 
Let's look at an example of a sellout: You're driving in heavy 
traffic. You begin to pass cars that are attempting to merge into 
your lane. A car very near you has accelerated and is entering your 
lane. A thought strikes you that you should let him in. It's the nice 
thing to do, and you'd want someone to let you in. But you don't. 
You accelerate forward and close the gap. What happens next? 
You begin to have thoughts like these: "He can't just crowd in on 
me. What a jerk! I've been fighting this traffic a long time. Besides, 
I've got an important appointment to get to." And so on. 
This story makes you the innocent victim and the other per­
son the nasty villain . Under the influence of this story you now 
feel jus tified in not doing what you originally thought you should 
have done. You also ignore what you would think of others who 
did the same thing-"That jerk didn't let me in !" 
Consider an example more related to crucial conversations . 
Your spouse has an annoying habit. It's not a big deal, but you 
feel you should mention it. But you don't. Instead, you just huff 
or roll your eyes, hoping that will send the message. Unfortun­
ately, your spouse doesn't pick up the hint and continues the habit. 
Your annoyance turns to resentment. You feel disgusted that your 
spouse is so thick that he or she can't pick up an obvious hint. And 
besides, you shouldn't have to mention this anyway-any reason­
able person should notice this on his or her own! Do you have to 
point out everything? From this point forward you begin to make 
insulting wisecracks about the issue until it escalates into an ugly 
confrontation. 
Notice the order of the events in both of these examples. What MASTER MY STORI ES 111 
came first, the story or the sellout? Did you convince yourself of 
the other driver's selfishness and then not let him in? Of course 
not. You had no reason to think he was selfish until you needed 
an excuse for your own selfish behavior. You didn't start telling 
clever stories until after you failed to do something you knew you 
should have done. Your spouse's annoying habit didn't become a 
source of resentment until you became part of the problem. You 
got upset because you sold out. And the clever story helped you 
feel good about being rude. 
Sellouts are often not big events. In fact, they can be so small 
that they're easy for us to overlook when we're crafting our 
clever stories. Here are some common ones: 
• You believe you should help someone, but don't. 
• You believe you should apologize, but don't. 
• You believe you should stay late to finish up on a commitment, 
but go home instead. 
• You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no 
one follows up to see if you keep your commitment. 
• You believe you should talk to someone about concerns you 
have with him or her, but don't. 
• You do less than your share and think you should acknowl­
edge it, but say nothing knowing no one else will bring it up 
either. 
• You believe you should listen respectfully to feedback, but 
become defensive instead. 
• You see problems with a plan someone presents and think you 
should speak up, but don't. 
• You fail to complete an assignment on time and believe you 
should let others know, but don't. 11 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
• You know you have information a coworker could use, but 
keep it to yourself. 
Even small sellouts like these get us started telling clever stories. 
When we don't admit to our own mistakes, we obsess about others' 
faults, our innocence, and our powerlessness to do anything other 
than what we're already doing. We tell a clever story when we want 
self-justification more than results. Of course, self-justification is 
not what we really want, but we certainly act as if it is. 
With that sad fact in mind, let's focus on what we really want. 
Let's look at the final Master My Stories skill. 
Tell the Rest of the Story 
Once we've learned to recognize the clever stories we tell our­
selves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dia­
logue-smart recognize that they're telling clever stories, stop, 
and then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by 
definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action-such as 
dialogue. 
And what transforms a clever story into a useful one? The rest 
of the story. That's because clever stories have one characteristic 
in common: They're incomplete. Clever stories omit crucial 
information about us, about others, and about our options. Only 
by including all of these essential details can clever stories be 
transformed into useful ones. 
What's the best way to fill in the missing details? Quite sim­
ply, it's done by turning victims into actors, villains into humans, 
and the helpless into the able. Here's how. 
Turn victims into actors. If you notice that you're talking 
about yourself as an innocent victim (and you weren't held up at 
gunpoint) , ask: 
• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the probl em? MASTER MY STORIES 11 3 
This question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, 
just maybe, you did something to help cause the problem. Instead 
of being a victim, you were an actor. This doesn't necessarily 
mean you had malicious motives. Perhaps your contribution was 
merely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed. 
For example , a coworker constantly leaves the harder or nox­
ious tasks for you to complete. You've frequently complained to 
friends and loved ones about being exploited. The parts you 
leave out of the story are that you smile broadly when your boss 
compliments you for your willingn ess to take on challenging 
jobs, and you've never said anything to your coworker. You've 
hinted, but that's about it. 
The first step in telling the rest of this story would be to add 
these important facts to your account. By asking what role 
you've played, you begin to realize how selective your perception 
has been. You become aware of how you've minimized your own 
mistakes while you've exaggerated the role of others. 
Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or 
otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask: 
• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what 
this person is doing? 
This particular question humanizes others. As we search for 
plausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often 
replaces judgment, and depending upon how we've treated oth­
ers, personal accountabi lity replaces self-justification. 
For instance, that coworker who seems to conveniently miss 
out on the tough jo bs told you recently that she could see you 
were struggling with an important assi gnment, and yesterday 
(while you were tied up on a pressing task) she pitched in and 
completed the job for you. You were instantly suspicious. She 
W'lS tryi ng to make you look bad by completing a high-profile 
jub. Huw dare she prctcnd to be helpful when her real goal was 11 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
to discredit you while tooting her own hom! Well, that's the 
story you've told yourself. 
But what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent 
person? What if she had no motive other than to give you a 
hand? Isn't it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don't 
you run the risk of ruining a relationship? Might you go off half­
cocked, accuse her, and then learn you were wrong? 
Our purpose for asking why a reasonable, rational, and decent 
person might be acting a certain way is not to excuse others for 
any bad things they may be doing. If they are, indeed, guilty, 
we'll have time to deal with that later. The purpose of the 
humanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emo­
tions. It provides us with still another tool for working on our­
selves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the 
other person's behavior. 
In fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less 
about others' intent and more about the effect others' actions are 
having on us. No longer are we in the game of rooting out 
unhealthy motives. And here's the good news. When we reflect 
on alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but 
equally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough 
to allow for dialogue-the only reliable way of discovering oth­
ers' genuine motives. 
Turn the helpless into the abl e. Final ly, when you catch your­
self bemoaning your own helples sness, you can tell the complete 
story by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask: 
• What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relation­
ship? 
Then, kill the Sucker's Choice that's made you feel helpless to 
choose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking: 
• What would I do right now if I really wanted these results? MASTER MY STORI ES 11 5 
For example, you now find yourself insulting your coworker 
for not pitching in with a tough job. Your coworker seems sur­
prised at your strong and "out of the blue" reaction. In fact, she's 
staring at you as if you've slipped a cog. You, of course, have told 
yourself that she is purposefully avoiding noxious tasks, and that 
despite your helpful hints, she has made no changes. 
"I have to get brutal," you tell yourself. "I don't like it, but if 
1 don't offend her, I'll be stuck doing the grunt work forever." 
You've strayed from what you really want-to share work 
equally and to have a good relationship. You've given up on half 
of your goals by making a Sucker's Choice. "Oh well, better to 
offend her than to be made a fool." 
What should you be doing instead? Openly, honestly, and 
effectively discussing the problem-not taking potshots and 
then justifying yourself. When you refuse to make yourself help­
less, you're forced to hold yourself accountable for using your 
dialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weaknes s. 
MARIA'S NE W STORY 
To see how this all fits together, let's circle back to Maria. Let's 
assume she's retraced her Path to Action and separated the facts 
from the stories. Doing this has helped her realize that the story 
she told was incomplete, defensive, and hurtful. When she 
watched for the Three Clever Stories, she saw them with painful 
clarity. Now she's ready to tell the rest of the story. So she asks 
herself: 
• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? 
"When I found out that Louis was holding project meetings 
without me, I felt like I should ask him about why I wasn 't 
inclu ded. I believed that if I did, I could open a dialogue that 
would help us work better together. But then I didn 't, and as 11 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
my resentment grew, [ was even less in terested in broaching 
the subject. " 
• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what 
Louis is doing? 
"He really cares about producing good-qualit y work. Maybe 
he doesn 't realize that I'm as commit ted to the success of the 
project as he is. " 
• What do I really want? 
"[ want a respectful relatio nship with Louis. And [ want 
recognition for the work [ do. " 
• What would I do right now if I really wanted these results? 
''I'd make an appointment to sit down with Louis and talk 
about how we work together. " 
As we tell the rest of the story, we free ourselves from the poi­
soning effects of unhealthy emotions. Best of all, as we regain 
control and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our 
own emotions rather than hostages. 
And what about Maria? What did she actually do? She sched­
uled a meeting with Louis. As she prepared for the meeting, she 
refused to feed her ugly and incomplete stories, admitted her 
own role in the problem, and entered the conversation with an 
open mind. Perhaps Louis wasn't trying to make her appear bad 
or fill in for her incompetence. 
As Maria sat down with Louis, she found a way to tentatively 
share what she had observed. (We'll look at exactly how to do 
this in the next chapter.) Fortunat ely, not only did Maria master 
her story, but she knew how to talk about it as well. While 
engaging in healthy dialogue, Louis apologized for not includ­
ing her in meetings with the boss. He explained that he was try­
ing to give the boss a heads-up on some controversial parts of MASTER MY STORIES 11 7 
the presentation-and realized in retrospect that he shouldn't 
have done this without her. He also apologized for dominating 
during the presentation. Maria learned from the conversation 
that Louis tends to talk more when he gets nervous. He sug­
gested that they each be responsible for either the first or sec­
ond half of the presentation and stick to their assi gnments so he 
would be less likely to crowd her out. The discussion ended 
with both of them understanding the other's perspective and 
Louis promising to be more sensitive in the future. 
SUM MARY- MASTER MY STORIES 
If strong emotions are keeping you stuck in silence or violence, 
try this. 
Retrace Your Path 
Notice your behavior. If you find yourself moving away from 
dialogue, ask yourself what you're really doing. 
• Am I in some form of silence or violence? 
Get in touch with your feelings. Learn to accurately identify 
the emotions behind your story. 
• What emotions are encouraging me to act this way? 
Analyze your stories. Question your conclusions and look for 
other possible explanations behind your story. 
• What story is creating these emotions? 
Get back to the facts. Abandon your absolute certainty by dis­
tinguishing between hard facts and your invented story. 
• What evidence do I have to support this story? 11 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS

Outspoken by whom? 
-DOROTHY PARKBR 
WHEN TOLD THAT SHE WAS WRY OUTSPOKEN 
STATE My Path 
How to Speak Persuasivel}/t 
Not Abrasively 
So far we've gone to great pains to prepare ourselves for crucial 
conversations. Here's what we've learned. Our hearts need to be 
in the right place. We need to pay close attention to crucial 
conversations -particularly when people start feeling unsafe. 
And heaven forbid that we should tell ourselves clever and 
unhelpful stories. 
So let's say that we are well prepared. We're ready to open our 
mouths and start sharing our pool of meaning. That's right, 
we're actually going to talk. Now what? 
Most of the time we walk into a discussion and slide into 
autopilot. "Hi, how are the kids? What's going on at work? " 
What could be easier than talking? We know thousands of words 12 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
and generally weave them into conversations that suit our needs. 
Most of the time. 
However, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, 
that's when we open our mouths and don't do so well. In fact, as 
we suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less 
likely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we 
advocate or express our views quite poorly. 
To help us improve our advocacy skills, we'll examine two 
challenging situations. First, we'll look at five skills for talking 
when what we have to say could easily make others defensive. 
Second, we'll explore how these same skills help us state our 
opinions when we believe so strongly in something that we risk 
shutting others down rather than opening them up to our ideas. 
SHARING RISKY MEAN ING 
Adding information to the pool of meaning can be quite difficult 
when the ideas we're about to dump into the collective conscious­
ness contain delicate, unattractive, or controversial opinions. 
"I'm sorry, Marta, but people simply don't like working with 
you. You've been asked to leave the special-proj ects team." 
It's one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from 
green to red packaging; it's quite another to tell a person that he 
or she is offensive or unlikable or has a controlling leadership 
style. When the topic turns from things to people, it's always 
more difficult, and to nobody's surprise, some people are better 
at it than others . 
When it comes to sharing touchy information, the worst alter­
nate between bluntly dumping their ideas into the pool and say­
ing nothing at all. Either they start with: "Y ou're not going to like 
this, but, hey, somebody has to be honest ... " (a classic Sucker's 
Choice), or they simply stay mum. STATE MY PATH 121 
Fearful they could easily destroy a healthy relationship, those 
who are good at dialogue say some of what's on their minds but 
understate their views out of fear of hurting others. They talk, 
but they sugarcoat their message. 
The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in 
a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say 
and respond to it as well. They are both totally frank and com­
pletely respectful. 
MAINTAIN SAFETY 
In order to speak honestly when honesty could easily offend oth­
ers, we have to find a way to maintain safety. That's a bit like 
telling someone to smash another person in the nose, but, you 
know, don't hurt him. How can we speak the unspeakable and still 
maintain respect? Actually, it can be done if you know how to 
carefully blend three ingredients- confidence, humility, and skill . 
Confidence. Most people simply won't hold delicate conversa­
tions-well, at least not with the right person. For instance, your 
colleague Brian goes home at night and tells his wife that his boss, 
Fernando, is micromanaging him to within an inch of his life. He 
says the same thing over lunch when talking with his pals. Every­
one knows what Brian thinks about Fernando-except, of course, 
Fernando. 
People who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say 
what needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They 
are confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool 
of meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly 
without brutalizing others or causing undue offense. 
Humility. Confidence does not equate to arrogance or pig­
headedness. Skilled people are confident that they have some­
thing to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They 
al 'e humble enough to realize that they don't have a monopoly on 12 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
the truth. Their opinions provide a starting point but not the final 
word. They may currently believe something but realize that with 
new information they may change their minds. This means 
they're willing to both express their opinions and encourage oth­
ers to do the same 
Skill. Fina lly, people who willingly share delicate information 
are good at doing it. That's why they're confident in the first 
place. They don't make a Sucker's Choice because they've found 
a path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the 
unspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty. 
Good Nigh t and Good -Bye! 
To see how to discuss sensitive issues, let's look at an enormously 
difficult problem. Bob has just walked in the door, and his wife, 
Carole, looks upset. He can tell from her swollen eyes that she's 
been crying. Only when he walks in the door, Carole doesn't turn 
to him for comfort. Instead, she looks at him with an expression 
that says "How could you?" Bob doesn't know it yet, but Carole 
thinks he's having an affair. He's not. 
How did Carole come to this dangerous and wrong con­
clusion? Earlier that day she had been going over the credit card 
statement when she noticed a charge from the Good Night 
Motel-a cheap place located not more than a mile from their 
home. "Why would he stay in a motel so close to home?" she 
wonders. "And why didn't I know about it?" Then it hits her­
"That unfaithful jerk !" 
Now what's the worst way Carole might handle this (one that 
doesn't involve packing up and moving back to Wisconsin)? 
What's the worst way of talking about the problem? Most peo­
ple agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a 
threat is a good candidate for that distinction. It's also what most 
people do, and Carole is no exception. STATE MY PATH 12 3 
"I can't believe you're doing this to me," she says in a painful 
tone. 
"Doing what?" Bob asks-not knowing what she's talking 
about but figuring that whatever it is, it can't be good. 
"You know what I'm talking about," she says, continuing to 
keep Bob on edge. 
"Do 1 need to apologize for missing her birthda y?" Bob won­
ders to himself. "No, it's not even summer and her birthday is on 
... well, it's sweltering on her birthday." 
"I'm sorry, 1 don't know what you're talking about ," he 
responds, taken aback. 
"You're having an affair, and 1 have proof right here!" Carole 
explains holding up a piece of crumpled paper. 
"What's on that paper that says I'm having an affair?" he asks, 
completely befuddled because (1) he's not having an affair and (2) 
the paper contains not a single compromising photo. 
"It's a motel bill, you jerk. You take some woman to a motel, 
and you put it on the credit card? ! 1 can't believe you're doing 
this to me!" 
Now if Carole were certain that Bob was having an affair, per­
haps this kind of talk would be warranted. It may not be the best 
way to work through the issue, but Bob would at least understand 
why Carole made the accusations and hurled threats. 
But, in truth, she only has a piece of paper with some num­
bers on it. This tangible piece of evidence has made her suspi­
cious. How should she talk about this nasty hunch in a way that 
leads to dialogue? 
STATE MY PATH 
I f Carole' s goal is to have a healthy conversation about a tough 
topic (e.g. , I think you 're ha vin g an affair), her only hope is to 12 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
stay in dialogue. That holds true for anybody with any crucial 
conversation (i.e., It feels like you micromanage me; I fear you're 
using drugs). That means that despite your worst suspicions, you 
shouldn't violate respect. In a similar vein, you shouldn't kill 
safety with threats and accusation s. 
So what should you do? Start with Heart. Think about what you 
really want and how dialogue can help you get it. And master your 
story-realize that you may be jumping to a hasty Vi ctim, Villain, 
or Helpless Story. The best way to fmd out the true story is not to 
act out the worst story you can generate. That will lead to self­
destructive silence and violence games. Think about other possible 
explanations long enough to temper your emotions so you can get 
to dialogue. Besides, if it turns out you're right about your initial 
impression, there will be plenty of time for confrontations later on. 
Once you've worked on yourself to create the right conditions 
for dialogue, you can then draw upon five distinct skills that can 
help you talk about even the most sensitive topics. These five tools 
can be easily remembered with the acronym STATE. It stands for: 
• Share your facts 
• Tell your story 
• Ask for others' paths 
• Talk tentatively 
• E.ncourage testing 
The first three skills describe what to do. The last two tell how 
to do it. 
The "What" Ski lls 
,Share Your Facts 
In the last chapter we suggested that if you retrace your Path to 
Action to the source, you eventually arrive at the ("acts. For STATE MY PATH 12 5 
example, Carole found the credit card invoice. That's a fact. She 
then told a story -Bob's having an affair. Next, she felt betrayed 
and horrified. Final ly, she attacked Bob-"I should never have 
married you !" The whole interaction was fast, predictable, and 
very ugly. 
What if Carole took a different route-one that started with 
facts? What if she were able to suspend the ugly story she told her­
self (perhaps think of an alternative story) and then start her con­
versation with the facts? Wouldn't that be a safer way to go? 
"Maybe," she muses, "there is a good reason behind all of this. 
Why don't I start with the suspicious bill and then go from there?" 
If she started there, she'd be right. The best way to share your 
view is to follow your Path to Action from beginning to end­
the same way you traveled it (Figure 7-1 ). Unfortunately, when 
we're drunk on adrenaline, our tendency is to do precisely the 
opposite. Since we're obses sing on our emotions and stories, 
that's what we start with. Of course, this is the most controver­
sial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin. 
To make matters worse, this strategy creates still another self­
fulfilling prophecy. We're so anxious to blurt out our ugly stories 
See! Tell a Feel Hear --... Story --... 
Figure 7-1. The Path to Action 12 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
that we say things in extremely ineffective ways . Then, when 
we get bad results (and we are going to get bad result s), we tell 
ourselves that we just can't share risky views without creating 
problems. So the next time we've got something sticky to say, 
we're even more reluctant to say it. We hold it inside where the 
story builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our 
horrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all 
over again. 
Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. 
By their very nature, facts aren't controversial. That's why we call 
them facts. For example, consider the statement: "Y esterday you 
arrived at work twenty minutes late." No dispute there. 
Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For 
example: "You can't be trusted." That's hardly a fact. Actually, it's 
more like an insult, and it can certainly be disputed. Eventually we 
may want to share our conclusions, but we certainly don't want to 
open up with a controversy. 
Facts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less contro­
versial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. 
Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade 
others, don't start with your stories. Start with your observations. 
For example, which of the following do you fmd more persuasive? 
or 
"I want you to stop sexually harassing me!" 
"When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather 
than look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on 
my shoulder." 
While we're speaking here about being persuasive, let's add 
that our goal is not to persuade others that we are right. We 
aren't trying to "win" the dialogue. We just want our meaning to 
get a fair hearing. We're trying to help others sec how a rca SOIl-STATE MY PATH 12 7 
able, rational, and decent person could end up with the story 
we're carrying. That's all. 
When we start with shocking or offensive conclusions ("Q uit 
groping me with your eyes !" or "I think we should declare bank­
ruptcy" ), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories 
about us. Since we've given them no facts to support our con­
clusion, they make up reasons we're saying these things. They're 
likely to believe we're either stupid or evil. 
So if your goal is to help others see how a reasonable, ration­
al, and decent person could think what you're thinking, start 
with your facts. 
And if you aren't sure what your facts are (your story is 
abs olutely filling your brain ), take the time to think them 
through before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time 
to sort out facts from conclusi ons. Gathering the facts is the 
homework required for crucial conversations . 
Facts are the least insul ting. If you do want to share your 
story, don't start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a 
rather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It 
could kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence. 
BRIAN: I'd like to talk to you about your leadership style. 
You micromanage me, and it's starting to drive me nuts. 
FERNA NDO: What? I ask you if you're going to be done on 
time and you lay into me with ... 
If you start with your story (and in so doing, kill safety), you 
may never actually get to the facts. 
Begin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, 
you need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. 
Let them experience your path from the beginning to the end, 
and not from the end to-well, to wherever it takes you. Let oth­
ers see your experience from your point of view-sta rting with 12 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
your facts. This way, when you do talk about what you're start­
ing to conclude, they'll understand why. First the facts, then the 
story-and then make sure that as you explain your story, you 
tell it as a possible story, not as concrete fact. 
BRIAN: Since I started work here, you've asked to meet with 
me twice a day. That's more than with anyone else. You 
have also asked me to pass all of my ideas by you before I 
include them in a project. [The facts] 
FERNA NDO: What's your point? 
BRIAN: I'm not sure that you're intending to send this mes­
sage, but I'm beginning to wonder if you don't trust me. 
Maybe you think I'm not up to the job or that I'll get 
you into trouble. Is that what's going on? [The possible 
story] 
FERNA NDO: Real ly, I was merely trying to give you a chance 
to get my input before you got too far down the path on a 
project. The last guy I worked with was constantly taking 
his project to near completion only to learn that he'd left 
out a key element. I'm trying to avoid surpr ises. 
Earn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. 
Facts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations. 
leI! Your Story 
Sharing your story can be tricky. Even if you've started with your 
facts, the other person can still become defensive when you 
move from facts to stories. After all, you're sharing potentially 
unflattering conclusions and ju dgments. 
Why share your story in the first place? Because the facts 
alone are rarely worth mentioning. It's the facts plus the conclu­
sion that call for a face-to-face discussion. In addition, if you STATE MY PATH 12 9 
simply mention the facts, the other person may not understand 
the severity of the implicatio ns. For example: 
"I noticed that you had company software in your brief­
case." 
"Yep, that's the beauty of software. It's portab le." 
"That particular software is proprietary. " 
"It ought to be ! Our future depends on it." 
"My understanding is that it's not supposed to go home." 
"Of course not. That's how people steal it." 
(Sounds like it's time for a conclus ion .) "I was wondering what 
the software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you're tak­
ing it home. Is that what's going on here?" 
It takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share 
negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., "I'm 
wondering if you're a thief"). It takes confidence to share such a 
potentially inflammatory story. However, if you've done your 
homework by thinking through the facts behind your story you'll 
realize that you are drawing a reasonable, rational, and decent 
conclusion. One that deserves hearing. And by starting with the 
facts, you've laid the groundwork. By thinking through the facts 
and then lea ding with them, you're much more likely to have the 
confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important 
meaning to the shared pool. 
Don 't pile it on. Sometimes we lack the confidence to speak 
up, so we let problems simmer for a long time. Given the 
chance, we generate a whole arsenal of unflat tering conclu­
sions. For example, you're about to hold a crucial conversation 
with your child's second-grade teacher. The teacher wants to 
hold your daughter back a year. You want your daughter to 
advance right along with her age group. This is what's going on 
in your head: 13 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
"I can't believe this ! This teacher is straight out of college, 
and she wants to hold Debbie back. To be perfectly frank, 
I don't think she gives much weight to the stigma of being 
held back. Worse still, she's quoting the recommendation of 
the school psychologi st. The guy's a real idiot. I've met him, 
and I wouldn't trust him with a common cold. I'm not 
going to let these two morons push me around." 
Which of these insulting conclusions or judgments should you 
share? Certainly not the entire menagerie of unflattering tales. In 
fact, you're going to need to work on this Villain Story before 
you have any hope of healthy dialogue. As you do, your story 
begins to sound more like this (note the careful choice of 
terms-after all, it is your story, not the facts): 
"When I first heard your recommendation, my initial reac­
tion was to oppose your decision. But after thinking about 
it, I've realized I could be wrong. I realized I don't really 
have any experience about what's best for Debbie in this 
situation-only fears about the stigma of being held back. 
I know it's a complex issue. I'd like to talk about how both 
of us can more objectively weigh this decision." 
Look for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for 
signs that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defen­
sive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and 
rebuild safety by Contrasting. 
Use Contrasting. Here's how it works : 
"I know you care a great deal about my daughter, and I'm 
confident you're well-trained. That's not my concern at all. 
I know you want to do what's best for Debbie, and I do too. 
My only issue is that this is an ambiguous decision with 
huge implications for the rest of her life." STATE MY PATH 131 
Be careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the 
goal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be 
sure that people don't hear more than you intend. Be confident 
enough to share what you really want to express. 
Ask for Other s' Paths 
We mentioned that the key to sharing sensitive ideas is a blend 
of confidence and humility. We express our confidence by shar­
ing our facts and stories clearly. We demonstrate our humility by 
then asking others to share their views . 
So once you've shared your point of view-fac ts and stories 
alike-invite others to do the same. If your goal is to learn rather 
than to be right, to make the best decision rather than to get your 
way, then you'll be willing to hear other views. By being open to 
learning we are demonstrating humility at its best. 
For example, ask yourself: "What does the schoolteacher 
think?" "Is your boss really intending to micromanage you?" "Is 
your spouse really having an affair?" 
To find out others' views on the matter, encourage them to 
express their facts, stories, and feelings. Then carefully listen to 
what they have to say. Equally important, be willing to abandon 
or reshape your story as more information pours into the Pool of 
Shared Meaning . 
The "Ho w" Skills 
Ia lk Tentatively 
If you look back at the vignettes we've shared so far, you'll note 
that we were careful to describe both facts and stories in a ten­
tative way. For exa mple, "I was wondering why ... " 
Talking tentatively simply means that we tell our story as a 
story rather than disguising it as a fact. "Perhaps you were 13 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
unaware ... " suggests that you're not absolutely certain. "In my 
opinion ... " says you're sharing an opinion and no more. 
When sharing a story, strike a blend between confidence and 
humility. Share in a way that expresses appropri ate confidence in 
your conclusions while demonstrating that, if appropri ate, you 
want your conclusions challenged. To do so, change "The fact is" 
to "In my opinion ." Swap "Everyone knows that" for "I'v e talked 
to three of our suppliers who think that." Soften "It' s clear to 
me" to "I'm beginning to wonder if." 
Why soften the message? Because we're trying to add mean­
ing to the pool, not force it down other people's throats. If we're 
too forceful, the information won't make it into the pool. 
Besides, with both facts and stories, we're not abs olutely certain 
they're true. Our observations could be faulty. Our stories­
well, they're only educated guesses. 
In addition, when we use tentative language, not only does it 
accurately portray our uncertain view, but it also helps reduce 
defensiveness and makes it safe for others to offer differing opin­
ions. One of the ironies of dialogue is that when we're sharing 
controversial ideas with potentially resistant people, the more 
forceful we are, the less persuasi ve we are. In short, talking ten­
tatively can actually increase our influence. 
Tenta tive, not wimpy. Some people are so worried about 
being too forceful or pushy that they err in the other direction. 
They wimp out by making still another Sucker's Choice. They 
figure that the only safe way to share touchy data is to act as if 
it's not important. 
"I know this is probably not true ... " or "Call me crazy 
but ... " 
When you begin with a complete disclaimer and do it in a tone 
that suggests you're consumed with doubt, you do the message a 
disservice. It's one thing to be humble and open. It's quite another STATE MY PATH 13 3 
to be clinically uncertain. Use language that says you're sharing an 
opinion, not language that says you're a nervous wreck. 
A "Go od" Story-The Goldi locks Test 
To get a feel for how to best share your story, making sure that 
you're neither too hard nor too soft, consider the following 
examples: 
Too soft: "This is probably stupid, but ... " 
Too hard: "How come you ripped us off?" 
lust right: "It' s starting to look like you're taking this home for 
your own use. Is that right?" 
Too soft: "I'm ashamed to even mention this, but ... " 
Too hard: "Just when did you start using hard drugs?" 
Just right: "It's leading me to conclude that you're starting to use 
drugs. Do you have another explanation that I'm missing 
here?" 
Too soft: "It's probably my fault, but ... " 
Too hard: "You wouldn't trust your own mother to make a one­
minute egg!" 
Just right: "I'm starting to feel like you don't trust me. Is that 
what's going on here? If so, I'd like to know what I did to 
lose your trust." 
Too soft: "Maybe I'm just oversexed or something, but ... " 
Too hard: "If you don't find a way to pick up the frequency, I'm 
walk ing." 
lust right: "I don't think you're intending this, but I'm beginning 
to feci rejected." 13 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
fncou rage Testing 
When you ask others to share their paths, how you phrase your 
invitation makes a big difference. Not only should you invite 
others to talk, but you have to do so in a way that makes it clear 
that no matter how controversial their ideas are, you want to 
hear them. Others need to feel safe sharing their obs ervations 
and stories-e ven if they differ. Otherw ise, they don't speak up 
and you can't test the accuracy and relevance of your views . 
This becomes particularly important when you're having a 
crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. 
Some people make Sucker's Choices in these circumstances. 
They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam 
up. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing 
others out. But the best at dialogue don't choose. They do both. 
They understand that the only limit to how strongly you can 
express your opinion is your willing ness to be equally vigorous 
in encouraging others to challenge it. 
Invite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, 
make it clear that you want to hear their views-no matter their 
opinion. If they disagree, so much the better. If what they have 
to say is controversial or even touchy, respect them for finding 
the courage to express what they're thinking. If they have differ­
ent facts or stories, you need to hear them to help complete the 
picture. Make sure they have the opportunity to share by active­
ly inviting them to do so: "Does anyone see it differently?" 
"What am I missing here?" "I'd really like to hear the other side 
of this story." 
Mean it. Sometimes people offer an invi tation that sounds 
more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. "Well, 
that's how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?" Invite people 
with both words and tone that say "I really want to hear from 
you." For instance: "I know people have been reluctant to speak 
up about this, but I would really love to hear from everyone." STATE MY PATH 13 5 
Or: "I know there are at least two sides to this story. Could we 
hear differing views now? What problems could this decision 
cause us?" 
Play devil's advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are 
not buying into your facts or story, but they're not speaking up 
either. You've sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing 
views , but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play 
devil's advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your 
own view. "Maybe I'm wrong here. What if the opposite is true? 
What if the reason sales have dropped is because ... " 
BACK TO THE MOTEL 
To see how all of the STATE skills fit together in a touchy con­
versation, let's return to the motel bill. Only this time, Carole 
does a far better job of bringing up a delicate issue. 
BOB: Hi honey, how was your day? 
CAROLE: Not so good. 
BOB: Why's that? 
CAROLE: I was checking our credit card bill, and I noticed a 
charge of forty-eight dollars for the Good Night Motel 
down the street. [Shares facts] 
BOB: Boy, that sounds wrong. 
CAROLE : It sure does. 
BOB: Well, don't worry. I'll check into it one day when I'm 
going by. 
CAROLE: I'd feel better if we checked right now. 
BOB: Really? It's less than fifty bucks . It can wait. 
CAROLE: It's not the money that has me worried. 
BOB: You're worried ? 13 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
CAROLE : It's a motel down the street. You know that's how 
my sister found out that Phil was having an affair. She 
found a suspicious hotel bill. [Shares story-t enta tively] I 
don't have anything to worry about do I? What do you 
think is going on with this bill? [Asks for other's path] 
BOB : I don't know, but you certainly don't have to worry 
about me. 
CAROLE : I know that you've given me no reason to question 
your fidelity. I don't really believe that you're having an 
affair. [C ontrasting] It's just that it might help put my 
mind to rest if we were to check on this right now. Would 
that bother you? [Encourages testing] 
BOB : Not at all. Let's give them a call and find out what's 
going on. 
When this conversation actually did take place, it sounded 
exactly like the one portrayed above. The suspicious spouse 
avoided nasty accusations and ugly stories, shared facts, and 
then tentatively shared a pos sible conclu sion. As it turns out, 
the couple had gone out to a Chinese restau rant earlier that 
month. The owner of the resta urant also owned the motel and 
used the same credit card imprinting machine at both estab­
lish ments. Oops. 
By tentatively sharing a story rather than attacking, name­
calling, and threatening, the worried spouse averted a huge bat­
tle, and the couple's relationship was strengthened at a time 
when it could easily have been damaged . 
STRONG BELIEF 
Now let's turn our attention to another communication challenge. 
This time you're not offering delicate feedback or iffy stories; 
you're merely going to step into an argument and advocate your STATE MY PATH 13 7 
point of view. It's the kind of thing you do all the time. You do it 
at home, you do it at work, and yes, you've even been known to 
fire off an opinion or two while standing in line at the DMV . 
Unfortunately, as stakes rise and others argue differing 
views- and you just know in your heart of hearts that you 're 
right and they're wrong-you start pushing too hard. You simply 
have to win. There's too much at risk and only you have the right 
ideas. Left to their own devices, others will mess things up. So 
when you care a great deal and are sure of your views, you don't 
merely speak-you try to force your opinions on others. Quite 
natura lly, others resist. You in turn push even harder. 
As consultants, we (the authors) watch this kind of thing hap­
pen all the time. For instance, seated around the table is a group 
of leaders who are starting to debate an important topic. First, 
someone hints that she's the only one with any real insight. Then 
someone else starts tossing out facts like so many poisonous 
darts. Another-it just so happens someone with critical infor­
mation-retreats into silence. As emotions rise, words that were 
once carefully chosen and tentatively delivered are now spouted 
with an absolute certainty that is typically reserved for claims 
that are nailed to church doors or carved on stone tablet s. 
In the end, nobody is listening, everyone is committed to 
silence or violence, and the Pool of Shared Meaning is dry. 
Nobody wins. 
How Did We Get like This? 
It starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas 
on others, it's generally because we believe we're right and every­
one else is wrong. There's no need to expand the pool of mean­
ing. because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it's our duty 
to fight for the truth that we're holding. It's the honorable thing 
tu do. It's what people of l:haral:ter do. 13 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Of course, others aren't exactly villains in this story. They sim­
ply don't know any better. We, on the other hand, are modern­
day heroes crusading against naivete and tunnel vision. 
We feel justified in using dirty tricks. Once we're convinced 
that it's our duty to fight for the truth, we start pulling out the 
big guns. We use debating tricks that we've picked up through­
out the years. Chief among them is the ability to "stack the 
deck." We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding 
or discrediting anything that doesn't. Then we spice things up 
with exaggeration: "Everyone knows that this is the only way to 
go." When this doesn't work, we lace our language with inflam­
matory terms: "All right- thinking people would agree with me." 
From there we employ any number of dirty tricks. We appeal 
to authority: "Well, that's what the boss thinks ." We attack the 
person: "You're not so naive as to actually believe that?" We 
draw hasty generalizations: "If it happened in our overseas oper­
ation, it'll happen here for sure ." 
And again, the harder we try and the more forceful our tac­
tics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, 
and the more battered our relationship s. 
How Do We Change? 
The solution to excessive advocacy is actually rather simple-if 
you can just bring yourself to do it. When you find yourself just 
dying to convince others that your way is best, back off your cur­
rent attack and think about what you really want for yourself, 
others, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, "How would I 
behave if these were the results I really wanted?" When your 
adrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you'll be able to 
use your STATE skill s. 
First, watch for the moment when people start to resist you. 
Turn your attention from the topic (no matter how important) to STATE MY PATH 13 9 
yourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more 
loudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in 
lengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The 
more you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on 
your best behavior. 
Second, tone down your approach. Open yourself up to the 
belief that others might have something to say, and better still, 
they might even hold a piece of the puzzle-and then ask them 
for their views. 
Of course, this isn't easy. Back ing off when we care the most 
is so counterintuitive that most of us have trouble pulling it off. 
It's not easy to soften your language when you're positive about 
something. And who wants to ask for other views when you 
know they're wrong? That's positively nuts. 
In fact, it can feel disingenuous to be tentative when your own 
strong belief is being brought into question. Of course, when you 
watch ot hers shift from healthy dialogue to forcing their way on 
others , it's obvious that if they don't back off, nobody will buy 
in. That's when you're watching others. On the other hand, when 
we ourselves are pushing hard, it's the correct thing to do. 
Rig ht? 
Let's face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion 
can be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something 
isn't bad in and of itself. It's okay to have strong opinions. The 
problem comes when we try to express them. 
For instance, when we believe strongly in a concept or a 
cause, our emotions kick in and we start trying to force our way 
onto others. As our emotions kick in, our ideas no longer flow 
into the pool. Instead, our thoughts shoot out of our mouths like 
water out of a raging fire hydrant. And guess what-others 
become defensive. When this happens, when our emotions tum 
our ideas into a harsh and painful stream of thoughts, our hon­
<.:st passion kills the argument rather than supports it. 14 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Catch yourself. So what's a person to do? Catch yourself 
before you launch into a monologue. Realize that if you're start­
ing to feel indignant or if you can't figure out why others don't 
buy in-after all, it's so obvious to you-recognize that you're 
starting to enter dangerous territory. 
Back off your harsh and conclusive language, not your belief. 
Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach. 
SUM MARY- STATE MY PATH 
When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so 
convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, 
remember to STATE your path: 
• S.hare your facts. Start with the least controversial, most per­
suasive elements from your Path to Action. 
• Tell your story. Explain what you're beginning to conclude. 
• A.sk for others' paths. Encourage others to share both their 
facts and their stories. 
• Talk tentat ively. State your story as a story-don't disguise it 
as a fact. 
• Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing 
or even opposing views. 8 
One of the best ways to persuade others 
is with your ears-by listening to them.

How to Listen When Others 
Blow Up or Clam Up 
Over the past few months your daughter Wendy has started to 
date a guy who looks like he's about ten minutes away from a 
felony arrest. After only a few weeks of dating this fellow, 
Wendy's clothing preference is now far too suggestive for your 
taste, and she routinely punctuates her language with expletives . 
When you carefully try to talk to her about these recent changes, 
she shouts accusations and insults and then withdraws to her 
room where she sulks for hours on end. 
Now what? Should you do something given that you're not 
the one going to silence or violence? When others clam up 
(refusing to speak their minds) or blow up (communicating in a 
way that is abusive and insulting), is there something you can do 
tu get them to dia logue? 14 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The answer is a resounding "It depends." If you want to let a 
sleeping dog lie (or, in this case, a potential train wreck go unat­
tended), then say nothing. It's the other person who seems to 
have something to say but refuses to open up. It's the other per­
son who's blown a cork. Run for cover. You can't take responsi­
bility for someone else's thoughts and feelings. Right ? 
Then again, you'll never work through your differences until 
all parties freely add to the pool of meaning. That means the peo­
ple who are blowing up or clamming up must participate as well. 
And while it's true that you can't force others to dialogue, you 
can take steps to make it safer for them to do so. After all, that's 
why they've sought the security of silence or violence in the first 
place. They're afraid that dialogue will make them vulnerable. 
Somehow they believe that if they engage in real conversation 
with you, bad things will happen. Your daughter, for instance, 
believes that if she talks with you, she'll be lectured, grounded, 
and cut off from the only guy who seems to care about her. 
Restoring safety is your greatest hope to get your relationship 
back on track. 
EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 
In Chapter 5 we recommended that whenever you notice safety 
is at risk, you should step out of the conversation and restore it. 
When you have offended others through a thoughtless act, apol­
ogize. Or if someone has misunderstood your intent, use 
Contrasting. Explain what you do and don't intend. Final ly, if 
you're simply at odds, find a Mutual Purpose. 
Now we add one more skill: Explore Others' Paths. Since 
we've added a model of what's going on inside another person's 
head (the Path to Action), we now have a whole new tool for 
helping others feel safe. If we can find a way to let others know 
that it's okay to share their Path to Action-their facts, and yes, EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 43 
even their nasty stories and ugly feelings-then they'll be more 
likely to open up. 
But what does it take? 
Start with Hear t-Get Ready to listen 
Be sin cere. To get at others' facts and stories, we have to invite 
them to share what's on their minds. We'll look at how to do this 
in a minute. For now, let's highlight the point that when you do 
invite people to share their views, you must mean it. For exam­
ple, consider the following incident. A patient is exiting a health­
care facility. The desk attendant can tell that she is a bit uneasy, 
maybe even dissatisfied. 
"Did everything go all right with the procedure?" the clerk asks. 
"Mostl y," the patient replies . (If ever there was a hint that 
something was wrong, the term "mostly" has to be it. ) 
"Good," the clerk abruptly responds and then follows with a 
resounding, "Next !" 
This is a classic case of pretending to be interested. It falls under 
the "How are you today?" category of inquiries. Meaning : "Please 
don't say anything of substance. I'm really just making small talk." 
When you ask people to open up, be prepared to listen. 
Be curious. When you do want to hear from others (and you 
should because it adds to the pool of meaning), the best way to get 
at the truth is by making it safe for them to express the stories that 
are moving them to either silence or violence. This means that at 
the very moment when most people become furious, we need to 
become curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder 
what's behind the ruckus. 
But how? How can we possibly act curious when others are 
eit her attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely 
seek to fi nd out why others are feeling unsafe have learned that 
gett ing at th e SOUl-ce or fear and di scomfort is the best way to 14 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
return to dialogue. Either they've seen others do it, or they've 
stumbled on the formula themselves. In either case, they realize 
that the cure to silence or violence isn't to respond in kind, but 
to get at the source. This calls for genuine curiosity-at a time 
when you're likely to be feeling frustrated or angry. 
To help turn your visceral tendency to respond in kind into 
genuine curiosi ty, look for opportunities to be curious. Start with 
a situation where you observe someone becoming emotional and 
you're still under control-such as a meeting (when you're not 
personally under attack and are less likely to get hooked) . Do 
your best to get at the person's source of fear or anger. Look for 
chances to tum on your curiosity rather than kick-start your 
adrenaline. 
To illustrate what can happen as we exercise our curiosit y, let's 
return to our nervous patient. 
CLERK : Did everything go all right with the procedure? 
PATIENT: Mostl y. 
CLERK: It sounds like you had a problem of some kind. Is 
that right? 
PATIENT: I'll say. It hurt quite a bit. And besides, isn't the 
doctor, like, uh, way too old? 
In this case, the patient is reluctant to speak up. Perhaps if 
she shares her honest opinion, she will insult the doctor, or 
maybe the loyal staff members will become offended. To deal 
with the problem, the desk attendant lets the patient know 
that it's safe to talk (as much with his tone as with his words ), 
and she opens up. 
Stay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories 
and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, 
Vi llain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they're say-EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 5 
ing what they're saying. Unfortunat ely, since it's rarely fun to 
hear other people's unflattering stories, we begin to assign nega­
tive motives to them for telling the stories. For example: 
CLERK: Well aren't you the ungrateful one! The kind doctor 
devotes his whole life to helping people and now that he's 
a little gray around the edges, you want to send him out 
to pasture! 
To avoid overreacting to others' stories, stay curious. Give 
your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: "Why would a rea­
sonable, rational, and decent person say this?" This question 
keeps you retracing the other person's Path to Action until you 
see how it all fits together. And in most cases, you end up seeing 
that under the circumstances, the individual in question drew a 
fairly reasonable conclusion. 
Be pa tient. When others are acting out their feelings and 
opinions through silence or violence, it's a good bet they're 
starting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best 
to safely and effectively respond to the other person's possible 
onslaught, we still have to face up to the fact that it's going to 
take a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for exam­
ple, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with 
respect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two 
of you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is 
still pushing too hard. While it's natural to move quickly from 
one thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to sub­
side. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they 
hang around in the bloodstream for a time-in some cases, long 
after thoughts have changed. 
So be patient when exploring how others think and feel. 
Encourage them to share their path and then wait for their emo­
tions to catch up with the safety that you've created. 14 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Encourage Other s to Retrace Their Path 
Once you've decided to maintain a curious approach, it's time to 
help the other person retrace his or her Path to Action. 
Unfortunately, most of us fail to do so. That's because when oth­
ers start playing silence or violence games, we're joining the con­
versation at the end of their Path to Action . They've seen and 
heard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling 
(possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointme nt), and now 
they're starting to act out their story. That's where we come in. 
Now, even though we may be hearing their first words, we're 
coming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to 
Action model, we're seeing the action at the end of the path-as 
shown in Figure 8-1. 
Every sentence has a history. To get a feel for how complicat­
ed and unnerving this process is, remember how you felt the last 
time your favorite mystery show started late because a football 
game ran long. As the game wraps up, the screen cross-fades 
from a trio of announcers to a starlet standing over a murder vic­
tim. Along the bottom of the screen are the discomforting words, 
"We now join this program already in progress." 
&eel TeU a 
Hear ---too-Story --...,... Fee l 
Figure 8-1. The Path to Action EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 7 
You shake the remote in exasperation. You've missed the 
entire setup! For the rest of the program you end up guessing 
about key facts. What happened before you joined in? 
Crucial conversations can be equally mysterious and frustrat­
ing. When others are in either silence or violence, we're actually 
joining their Path to Action already in progress. Consequently, 
we've already missed the foundation of the story and we're con­
fused. If we're not careful, we can become defensive. After all, 
not only are we joining late, but we're also joining at a time when 
the other person is starting to act offensively. 
Break the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we're on 
the receiving end of someone's retributions, accusations, and cheap 
shots, rarely do we think: "M y, what an interesting story he or she 
must have told. What do you suppose led to that?" Instead, we 
match this unhealthy behavior. Our defense mechanisms kick in, 
and we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action. 
People who know better cut this dangerous cycle by stepping 
out of the interaction and making it safe for the other person to 
talk about his or her Path to Action. They perform this feat by 
encouraging him or her to move away from harsh feelings and 
knee-jerk reactions and toward the root cause. In essence, they 
retrace the other person's Path to Action together. At their 
encouragement, the other person moves from his or her emo­
tions, to what he or she concluded, to what he or she observed. 
When we help others retrace their path to its origins, not only 
do we help curb our reaction, but we also return to the place 
where the feelings can be resolved-at the source, or the facts 
and the story behind the emotion. 
POWER UP 
When? So far we've suggested that when other people appear to 
have a story to tel l and facts to share, it's our job to invite them 14 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
to do so. Our cues are simple: Others are going to silence or vio­
lence. We can see that they're feeling upset, fearful, or angry. We 
can see that if we don't get at the source of their feelings, we'll 
end up suffering the effects of the feelings. These external reac­
tions are our cues to do whatever it takes to help others retrace 
their Paths to Action. 
How? We've also suggested that whatever we do to invite the 
other person to open up and share his or her path, our invitation 
must be sincere. As hard as it sounds, we must be sincere in the 
face of hostility, fear, or even abuse-which leads us to the next 
question. 
What? What are we supposed to actually do? What does it 
take to get others to share their path-stories and facts alike? In 
a word, it requires listening. In order for people to move from 
acting on their feelings to talking about their conclusions and 
observations, we must listen in a way that makes it safe for oth­
ers to share their intimate thoughts. They must believe that when 
they share their thoughts, they won't offend others or be pun­
ished for speaking frankly. 
AMPP 
To encourage others to share their paths we'll use four power lis­
tening tools that can help make it safe for other people to speak 
frankly. We call the four skills power listening tools because they 
are best remembered with the acronym AMPP- Ask, Mirror, 
Paraphrase, and Prime. Luckily, the tools work for both silence 
and violence games. 
Ask to Get Th in gs Ro lling 
The easiest and most straightforward way to encourage others to 
share their Path to Action is simply to invite them to express them­
selves. For example, often all it takes to break an impasse is to seek EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 9 
to understand others' views. When we show genuine interest, peo­
ple feel less compelled to use silence or violence. For example: "Do 
you like my new dress, or are you going to call the modesty 
police?" Wendy smirks. 
"What do you mean?" you ask. "I'd like to hear your concerns." 
If you're willing to step out of the fray and simply invite the 
other person to talk about what's really going on, it can go a long 
way toward breaking the downward spiral and getting to the 
source of the problem. 
Common invitations include: 
"What's going on?" 
"I'd really like to hear your opinion on this." 
"Please let me know if you see it differently." 
"Don't worry about hurting my feelings. I really want to 
hear your thoughts." 
Mi rror to Confirm Feelings 
If asking others to share their path doesn't open things up, mirror­
ing can help build more safety. In mirroring, we take the portion of 
the other person's Path to Action we have access to and make it 
safe for him or her to discuss it. All we have so far are actions and 
some hints about the other person's emotions, so we start there. 
When we mirror, as the name sugg ests, we hold a mirror up 
to the other person-describing how they look or act. Although 
we may not understand others' stories or facts, we can see their 
actions and get clues about their feelings. 
This particular tool is most useful when another person's tone 
or voice or gestures (hints about the emotions behind them) are 
inconsistent with his or her words. For example: "Don't worry. 
I' m fine." (But the person in question is saying this with a look 
t hat suggests he is actually quite upset. He's frowning, looking 
around, and sort of kicking at the ground.) 1 50 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
"Really? From the way you're saying that, it doesn't sound like 
you are." 
We explain that while the person may be saying one thing, his 
or her tone of voice or body posture suggests something else. In 
doing so, we show respect and concern for him or her. 
The most important element of mirroring is our tone of voice. 
It is not the fact that we are acknowledging others' emotions that 
creates safety. We create safety when our tone of voice says we're 
okay with them feeling the way they're feeling. If we do this well, 
they may conclude that rather than acting out their emotions, 
they can confidently talk them out with us instead. 
So as we describe what we see, we have to do so calmly. If we 
act upset or as if we're not going to like what others say, we don't 
build safety. We confirm their suspicions that they need to 
remain silent. 
Examples of mirroring include: 
"You say you're okay, but by the tone of your voice, you 
seem upset." 
"You seem angry at me. " 
"You look nervous about confronting him. Are you sure 
you're willing to do it?" 
�a raph rase to Acknow ledge the Story 
Asking and mirroring may help you get part of the other person's 
story out into the open. When you get a clue about why the per­
son is feeling as he or she does, you can build additional safety 
by paraphrasing what you've heard. Be careful not to simply par­
rot back what was said. Instead, put the message in your own 
words-us ually in an abbreviated form . 
"Let's see if I've got this right. You're upset because I've 
voiced my concern about some of the clothes you wear. And 
this seems controlling or old-fashioned to you." EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 51 
The key to paraphrasing, as with mirroring, is to remain calm 
and collected. Our goal is to make it safe, not to act horrified and 
suggest that the conversation is about to tum ugly. Stay focused 
on figuring out how a reasonable, rational, and decent person 
could have created this Path to Action . This will help you keep 
from becoming angry or defensive. Simply rephrase what the per­
son has said, and do it in a way that suggests that it's okay, you're 
trying to understand, and it's safe for him or her to talk candidly. 
Don 't push too hard. Let's see where we are. We can tell that 
another person has more to share than he or she is currently 
sharing. He or she is going to silence or violence, and we want 
to know why. We want to get back to the source (the fact s) 
where we can solve the problem. To encourage the person to 
share, we've tried three listening tools. We've asked, mirrored, 
and paraphrased. The person is still upset, but isn't explaining 
his or her stories or facts. 
Now what? At this point, we may want to back off. After a 
while, our attempts to make it safe for others can start feeling as 
if we're pestering or prying. If we push too hard, we violate both 
purpose and respect. Others may think our purpose is merely to 
extract what we want from them and conclude that we don't care 
about them personally. So instead, we back off. Rather than try­
ing to get to the source of the other person's emotions, we either 
gracefully exit or ask what he or she wants to see happen. Asking 
people what they want helps them engage their brains in a way 
that moves to problem solving and away from either attacking or 
avoiding. It also helps reveal what they think the cause of the 
problem is. 
frime When You'r e Getti ng Nowher e 
On the other hand, there are times when you may conclude that 
others would like to open up but still don't feel safe. Or maybe 
they're still in viole nce, haven 't come down from the adrenaline, 15 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
and aren't explaining why they're angry. When this is the case, 
you might want to try priming. Prime when you believe that the 
other person still has something to share and might do so with a 
little more effort on your part. 
The power-listening term priming comes from the expression 
"priming the pump." If you've ever worked an old-fashioned 
hand pump, you understand the metaphor. Wi th a pump, you 
often have to pour some water into it to get it running. Then it 
works just fine. When it comes to power listening, sometimes 
you have to offer your best guess at what the other person is 
thinking or feeling. You have to pour some meaning into the 
pool before the other person will do the same. 
A few years back, one of the authors was working with an 
executive team that had decided to add an afternoon shift to one 
of the company's work areas. The machinery wasn't being fully 
utilized, and the company couldn't afford to keep the area open 
without adding a three-to-midnight crew. This, of course, meant 
that the people currently working days would now have to rotate 
every two weeks to afternoons. It was a tortured but necessary 
choice. 
As the execs held a meeting to announce the unpopular 
change, the existing work crew went silent. They were obviously 
unhappy, but nobody would say anything. The operations man­
ager was afraid that people would misinterpret the company's 
actions as nothing more than a grab for more money. In truth, 
the area was losing money, but the decision was made with the 
current employees in mind. With no second shift, there would be 
no jobs . He also knew that asking people to rotate shifts and to 
be away from loved ones during the afternoon and evening 
would cause horrible burdens. 
As people sat silently fuming, the executive did his best to get 
them to talk so that they wouldn't walk away with unresolved 
feelings. He mirrored, "I can see you're upset-who wouldn't EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 53 
be? Is there anything we can do?" Nothing. Finally, he primed. 
That is, he took his best guess at what they might be thinking, 
said it in a way that showed it was okay to talk about it, and then 
went on from there. "Are you thinking that the only reason we're 
doing this is to make money? Tha t maybe we don't care about 
your personal lives?" 
After a brief pause, someone answered: "Well, it sure looks 
like that. Do you have any idea how much trouble this is going 
to cause?" Then someone else chimed in and the discussion was 
off and running. 
Now, this is not the kind of thing you would do unless noth­
ing else has worked. You really want to hear from others, and 
you have a very strong idea of what they're probably thinking. 
Priming is an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming vulnera­
ble, and building safety in hopes that others will share their 
meaning. 
But What If They're Wrong? 
Sometimes it feels dangerous to sincerely explore the views of 
someone whose path is wildly different from your own. He or 
she could be completely wrong, and we're acting calm and col­
lected. This makes us nervous. 
To keep ourselves from feeling nervous while exploring others' 
paths-no matter how different or wrong they seem-remember 
we're trying to understand their point of view, not necessarily 
agree with it or support it. Understanding doesn't equate with 
agreement. By coming to understand another person's Path to 
Action, we are not accepting it as absolute truth. There will be 
plenty of time later for us to share our path as well. For now , 
wc're merely trying to get at what others think in order to under­
stand why they're feeling the way they're feeling and doing what 
th ey 'r c doing. 1 54 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
EXPLORING WEN DY'S PATH 
Now let's put the several skills together in a single interaction. We'll 
return to Wendy. She has just come home from a date with the guy 
who has you frightened. You yank the door open, pull Wendy into 
the house, and double-bolt your entrance. Then you talk, sort of. 
WENDY: How could you embarrass me like that! 1 get one 
boy to like me, and now he'll never talk to me again! 1 
hate you! 
You: That wasn't a boy. That was a future inmate. You're 
worth more than that. Why are you wasting your time 
with him? 
WENDY: You're ruining my life. Leave me alone! 
After Wendy's bedroom door slams shut, you drop down 
into a chair in the living room. Your emotions are running 
wild. You're terrified about what could happen if Wendy con­
tinues to see this guy. You're hurt that she said she hated you. 
You feel that your relationship with her is spiraling out of 
control. 
So you ask yourself, "What do 1 really want?" As you mull this 
question over, your motives change. The goals of controlling 
Wendy and defending your pride drop from the top to the bottom 
of your list. The goal that's now at the top looks a bit more inspir­
ing: "I want to understand what she's feeling. 1 want a good rela­
tionship with Wendy. And I want her to make choices that will 
make her happy." 
You're not sure if tonight is the best or worst time to talk, but you 
know that talking is the only path forward. So you give it a shot. 
You: (Tapping on door.) Wendy? May I talk with you 
please? 
WENDY: Whatever. EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 55 
(You enter her room and sit on her bed. ) 
YOU: I'm really sorry for embarrassing you like that. That 
was a bad way to handle it. [Apologize to build safety] 
WENDY: It's just that you do that a lot. It's like you want to 
control everything in my life . 
YOU: Can we talk about that? [Ask] 
WENDY: (Sounding angry) It's no big deal. You're the par­
ent, right? 
YOU: From the way you say that, it sounds like it is a big 
deal. [Mirror] I really would like to hear what makes you 
think I'm trying to control your life. [Ask] 
WENDY: What, so you can tell me more ways that I'm 
screwed up? I've finally got one friend who accepts me, 
and you're trying to chase him away! 
YOU: So you feel like I don't approve of you, and your friend 
is one person who does? [Paraphrase] 
WENDY: It's not just you. All my friends have lots of boys 
who like them. Doug's the first guy who's even called me. 
I don't know-never mind. 
YOU: I can see how you'd feel badly when others are getting 
attention from boys and you aren't. I'd probably feel the 
same way. [Paraphrase] 
WENDY: Then how could you embarra ss me like that? ! 
YOU: Honey, I'd like to take a stab at something here. I won­
der if part of the reason you've started dressing differently 
and hanging out with different friends is because you're 
not feeling cared about and valued by boys, by your par­
ents, and by others right now. Is that part of it? [Prime]

From here, the conversation goes to the real issues, parent and 
daughter discuss what's really going on, and both come to a better 
understanding of each other. 
REMEM BER YOUR ABCs 
Let's say you did your level best to make it safe for the other per­
son to talk. After asking, mirroring, paraphrasing, and eventually 
priming, the other person opened up and shared his or her path. 
It's now your turn to talk. But what if you disagree? Some of the 
other person's facts are wrong, and his or her stories are com­
pletely fouled up. Well, at least they're a lot different from the 
story you've been telling. Now what? 
Agree 
As you watch families and work groups take part in heated 
debates, it's common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. 
Although the various parties you're observing are violently argu­
ing, in truth, they're in violent agreement. They actually agree on 
every important point, but they're still fighting. They've found a 
way to turn subtle differences into a raging debate. 
For example, last night your teenage son broke his curfew 
again. You and your spouse have spent the morning arguing 
about the infraction. Last time James came in late, you agreed to 
ground him, but today you're upset because it seems like your 
spouse is backpedaling by suggesting that James still be able to 
attend a football camp this week. Tu rns out it was just a misun­
derstanding. You and your spouse agree to the grounding-the 
central issue. You thought your spouse was reneging on the agree­
ment when, in truth, you just hadn't actually resolved the date the 
grounding would start. You had to step back and listen to what EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 15 7 
you were both saying to realize that you weren't really disagree­
ing, but violently agreeing. 
Most arguments consist of battles over the 5 to 10 percent of 
the facts and stories that people disagree over. And while it's true 
that people eventually need to work through differences, you 
shouldn't start there. Start with an area of agreement. 
So here's the take-away. If you completely agree with the 
other person's path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. 
Don't turn an agreement into an argument. 
Ruild 
Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is 
because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other per­
son has said. Never mind that it's a minor portion. If it's a point 
of disagreement, we'll jump all over it like a fleeing crimi nal. 
Actually, we're trained to look for minor errors from an early 
age. For instance, we learn in kindergarten that if you have the 
right answer, you're the teacher's pet. Being right is good. Of 
course, if others have the right answer they get to be the pet. So 
being right first is even better. You learn to look for even the tini­
est of errors in others' facts, thinking, or logic. Then you point 
out the errors. Being right at the expense of others is best. 
By the time you finish your education, you have a virtual 
Ph.D. in catching trivial differences and turning them into a 
major deal. So when another person offers up a suggestion 
(based on facts and stories), you're looking to disagree. And 
when you do find a minor difference, you turn this snack into a 
meal. Instead of remaining in healthy dialogue, you end up in 
violent agreement. 
On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in 
dialogue, it becomes clear that they're not playing this everyday 15 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
game of Trivial Pursuit-looking for trivial differences and then 
proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they're looking for points of 
agreement. As a result, they'll often start with the words "I 
agree." Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, 
that's where they start. 
Now when the other person has merely left out an element of 
the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather 
than saying: "Wrong. You forgot to mention ... ," they say: 
"Absolute ly. In addition, I noticed that ... " 
If you agree with what has been said but the information is 
incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement and then add 
elements that were left out of the discussion . 
.compare 
Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other 
person's . That is, rather than suggesting that he or she is 
wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be 
wrong, but you don't know for sure until you hear both sides 
of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. 
So instead of pronouncing "Wrong!" start with a tentative but 
candid opening such as "I think I see things differently. Let me 
describe how." 
Then share your path using the STAT E skills from Chapter 7. 
That is, begin by sharing your observations. Share them tenta­
tively, and invite others to test your ideas. After you've shared 
your path, invite the other person to help you compare it with 
his or her experience. Work together to explore and explain the 
differences. 
In summar y, to help remember these skills, think of your 
ABCs. Agree when you agree. Build when others leave out key 
pieces. Compare when you differ. Don't tum differences into 
debates that lead to unhealthy relationships and bad results. EXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 15 9 
SUM MARY-EX PLORE OTHERS' PATHS 
To encourage the free flow of meaning and help others leave 
silence or violence behind, explore their Paths to Action. Start 
with an attitude of curiosity and patience. This helps restore 
safety. 
Then, use four powerful listening skills to retrace the other 
person's Path to Action to its origins. 
• Ask. Start by simply expressing interest in the other person's 
views. 
• Mirror. Increase safety by respectfully acknowledging the 
emotions people appear to be feeling. 
• l!.araphrase. As others begin to share part of their story, 
restate what you've heard to show not just that you under­
stand, but also that it's safe for them to share what they're 
thinking. 
• Prime. If others continue to hold back, prime. Ta ke your best 
guess at what they may be thinking and feeling. 
As you begin to share your views, remem ber: 
• Agree. Agree when you do. 
• Bui ld. If others leave something out, agree where you do, 
then build. 
• Qompare. When you do differ significantly, don't suggest others 
are wrong. Compare your two views. To do nothmg IS m every man' s power.

Move to Action 
How to Turn Crucial 
Conv ersations into 
Action and Results 
Up until this point we've suggested that getting more meaning 
into the pool helps with dialogue. It's the one thing that helps 
people make savvy decisions that, in turn, lead to smart actions. 
In order to encourage this free flow of meaning, we've shared the 
skills we've been able to learn by watching people who are gift­
ed at dialogue. By now, if you've followed some or all of this 
advice, you're walking around with full pools. People who walk 
near you should hear the sloshing. 
It's time we add two final skills. Having more meaning in the 
pool. even jointly owning it, doesn't guarantee that we all agree 
on what we're going to do with the meaning. For example, when 
Il!ums or families meet and generate a host of ideas, they often 
fail to convert the ideas into action for two reasons: 16 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
• They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be 
made. 
• They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. 
This can be dangerous. In fact, when people move from adding 
meaning to the pool to moving to action, it's a prime time for new 
challenges to arise. Who is supposed to take the assignment? 
That can be controversial. How are we supposed to decide in the 
first place? That can be emotional. Let's take a look at what it 
takes to solve each of these problems. First, making decisions. 
DIALOG UE IS NOT DEC ISION MAKI NG 
The two riskiest times in crucial conversations tend to be at the 
beginning and at the end. The beginning is risky because you 
have to find a way to create safety or else things go awry. The end 
is dicey because if you aren't careful about how you clarify the 
conclusion and decisions flowing from your Pool of Shared 
Meaning, you can run into violated expectations later on. This 
can happen in two ways. 
How are decisions going to be made? First, people may not 
understand how decisions are going to be made. For example, 
Cara is miffed. Rene just plunked down a brochure for a three­
day cruise and announced he had made reservations and even 
paid the five hundred dollar deposit for an outside suite. 
A week ago they had a crucial conversation about vacation 
plans. Both expressed their views and preferences respectfully 
and candidly. It wasn't easy, but at the end they concluded a 
cruise suited both quite well. And yet Cara is miffed, and Rene 
is stunned that Cara is anything less than ecstatic. 
Cara agreed in principle about a cruise. She didn't agree with 
this particular cruise. Rene thought that any cruise would be fine 
and made a decision on his own. Have fun on the cruise. Rene. MOVE TO ACTION 16 3 
Are we ever going to decide ? The second problem with deci­
sion making occurs when no decision gets made. Either ideas 
slip away and dissipate, or people can't figure out what to do 
with them. Or maybe everyone is waiting for everyone else to 
make the decisio ns. "H ey, we filled the pool. Now you do some­
thing with it ." In any case, decisions drag on forever. 
DECIDE HOW TO DECIDE 
Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, 
the people involved decide how to decide. Don't allow people to 
assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process 
for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, 
of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone 
is allowed to share their meaning-actually encouraged to share 
their meaning-doesn't mean they are then guaranteed to take 
part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, 
separate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how deci­
sions will be made-who will be involved and why. 
When the line of authority is clear. When you're in a position 
of authority, you decide which method of decision making you'll 
use. Managers and parents, for example, decide how to decide. It's 
part of their responsibility as leaders. For instance, VPs don't ask 
hourly employees to decide on pricing changes or product lines. 
Tha t's the leaders' job. Parents don't ask small children to pick 
their home security device or to set their own curfew. That's the 
job of the parent. Of course, both leaders and parents tum more 
decisions over to their direct reports and children when they war­
rant the responsibility, but it's still the authority figure who decides 
what method of decision making to employ. Deciding what deci­
sions to tum over and when to do it is part of their stewardship. 
When the line of aut hority isn 't clear. When there is no clear 
li ne of aut hority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult. 16 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
For instance, consider a conversation we referred to earlier-the 
one you had with your daughter's schoolteacher. Should you hold 
your child back? Whose choice is this anyway? Who decides 
whose choice it is? Does everyone have a say, then a vote? Is it 
the school officials' responsibility, so they choose? Since parents 
have ultimate responsibility, should they consult with the appro­
priate experts and then decide? Is there even a clear answer to 
this tough question? 
A case like this is hand-tooled for dialogue. All of the partici­
pants need to get their meaning into the pool-including their 
opinions about who should make the final choice. That's part of 
the meaning you need to discuss. If you don't openly talk about 
who decides and why, and your opinions vary widely, you're like­
ly to end up in a heated battle that can only be resolved in court. 
Handled poorly, that's exactly where these kind of issues are 
resolved-T he l ones Family vs. Happy Valley School District. 
So what's a person to do? Talk openly about your child's abil­
ities and interests as well as about how the final choice will be 
made. Don't mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening com­
ments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial cli­
mate. Your goal is to have an open, honest, and healthy discus­
sion about a child, not to exert your influence, make threats, or 
somehow beat the educators. Stick with the opinions of the 
experts at hand, and discuss how and why they should be 
involved. When decision-making authority is unclear, use your 
best dialogue skills to get meaning into the pool. Jointly decide 
how to decide. 
The Four Methods of Decision Making 
When you're deciding how to decide, it helps to have a way of 
talking about the decision-making options available. There are 
four common ways of making decisions : command, consult, MOVE TO ACTION 16 5 
vote, and consensus. These four options represent increasing 
degrees of involvement. Increased involvement, of course, brings 
the benefit of increased commitment along with the curse of 
decreased decision-making efficiency. Savvy people choose from 
among these four methods of decision making the one that best 
suits their particular circumstances. 
Comm and 
Let's start with decisions that are made with no involvement what­
soever. This happens in one of two ways. Either outside forces 
place demands on us (demands that leave us no wiggle room), or 
we tum decisions over to others and then follow their lead. We 
don't care enough to be involved-let someone else do the work. 
In the case of external forces, customers set prices, agencies 
mandate safety standards, and other governing bodies simply 
hand us demands. As much as employees like to think their boss­
es are sitting around making choices, for the most part they're 
simply passing on the demands of the circumstances. These are 
command decisions. With command decisions, it's not our job to 
decide what to do. It's our job to decide how to make it work. 
In the case of turning decisions over to others, we decide 
either that this is such a low-stakes issue that we don't care 
enough to take part or that we completely trust the ability of the 
delegate to make the right decision. More involvement adds 
nothing. In strong teams and great relationships, many decisions 
are made by turning the final choice over to someone we trust to 
make a good decision. We don't want to take the time ourselves 
and gladly tum the decision over to others. 
Consu lt 
Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to 
influenec them before they make their choice. You can consult 16 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
with experts, a representative population, or even everyone who 
wants to offer an opinion. Consulting can be an efficient way of 
gaining ideas and support without bogging down the decision­
making process. At least not too much. Wise leaders, parents, 
and even couples frequently make decisions in this way. They 
gather ideas, evaluate options, make a choice, and then inform 
the broader population. 
Vote 
Vo ting is best suited to situations where efficiency is the highest 
value-and you're selecting from a number of good options. 
Members of the team realize they may not get their first choice, 
but frankly they don't want to waste time talking the issue to 
death. They may discuss options for a while and then call for a 
vote. When facing several decent options, voting is a great time 
saver but should never be used when team members don't agree 
to support whatever decision is made. In these cases, consensus 
is required. 
Co nsensus 
This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. 
Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one 
decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high­
quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of 
time. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex 
issues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the 
final choice. 
HOW TO CHOOSE 
Now that we know the four methods, let's explore which method 
to use at which time- along with some hints about how to avoid 
common blunders. MOVE TO ACTION 16 7 
Four Im portant Questions 
When choosing among the four methods of decision making, 
consider the following questions. 
1. Who cares? Determine who genuinely wants to be involved 
in the decision along with those who will be affected. These 
are your candidates for involvement. Don't involve people 
who don't care. 
2. Who knows ? Identify who has the expertise you need to 
make the best decision. Encourage these people to take 
part. Try not to involve people who contribute no new 
information. 
3. Who must agree? Think of those whose cooperation you 
might need in the form of authority or influence in any 
decisions you might make. It's better to involve these 
people than to surprise them and then suffer their open 
resistance. 
4. How many people is it worth involving? Your goal should 
be to involve the fewest number of people while still con­
sidering the quality of the decision along with the support 
that people will give it. Ask: "Do we have enough people to 
make a good choice? Will others have to be involved to 
gain their commitm ent?" 
How about you? Here's a suggestion for a great exercise for 
teams or couples, particularly those that are frustrated about 
decision making. Make a list of some of the important decisions 
made in the team or relationship. Then discuss how each deci­
sion is currently made, and how each should be made-usi ng the 
four im portant questions. After discus sing each decision, decide 
how you wi ll make decisions in the future. A crucial conversa­
tion a bout your decision-makin g practices can resolve many frus­
Iruling issues. 16 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
DE CISI ON-M AKI NG BLUND ERS AND SOLUTI ONS 
Now, let's look at each of the four methods in turn. What are the 
common blunders associated with each, and more importantly, 
how can we avoid them? 
Appropriate Use of Com mand 
The mistake. For years, employees have complained that their 
bosses are far too bossy. They hand out orders like Halloween 
candy. They not only tell people what to do, but also restrict 
them to only one way of doing it. They give directions down to 
the tiniest detail when it would be better to allow the employee 
to work out the details of how the job will be done. After all, the 
employee is not only closest to the job, but is also the expert on 
how to do it. 
To day's generation of employees (and children, for that mat­
ter) expects to be involved in more decisions than their grand­
parents ever faced. That's where the empowerment movement 
came from . Younger people don't see themselves as a pair of 
hands seeking direction. They want to think. They want to 
decide. The y're willing to take on more responsibility. 
So as you face a potential "command decision," consider the 
following: 
• Don 't pass out orders like candy. We face enough command 
decisions (constraints placed on us by outside forces) without 
making up new ones. As a general rule, if people can make choic­
es, allow them to do so. Don't tie their hands without reason. 
With kids, for example, you may establish rules about cleanliness 
in the common areas of the home, but you may let them choose 
(within the boundaries of hygiene) how to keep their rooms. 
• When you face a command decision, ask which elements are 
flexible. Once a standard has been set by an agency or an order MOVE TO ACTION 16 9 
placed by a customer, while you may not be able to decide what 
to work on or what standards to follow, you can decide how to 
work. Find out where you do have degrees of freedom and then 
allow others to choose within these boundaries . 
• Explain why. When handing down an order, explain the reason 
behind the demand. Knowing why helps make what a lot eas­
ier. For example, if you decide overtime is needed to meet a 
deadline, it helps to explain why you came to this conclusion. 
The Dos and Don' ts of Consultation 
The most obvious problem with consultation is that people 
believe that if you involve them in sharing ideas, they get to make 
the decision. It's easy to see how this happens since you ask for 
people's input, you weigh all the options, and you make a deci­
sion. Then two-thirds of those you asked feel violated because 
you didn't do what they told you to do. 
Dialogue is a great tool for consultation. It enables you to get 
all meaning into the shared pool. But before people start con­
tributing, be sure they understand that the fact that you are con­
sulting with them does not mean that eventually the decision will 
be made by consensus. 
When should you use consultation? Consult when (1) many 
people will be affected, (2) you can gather information relative­
Iy easily, (3) people care about the decision, and (4) there are 
many options, some of them controversial. 
When these conditions apply, find a way to touch base with a 
lot of people in different positions, locations, and functions 
before moving on. Don't simply call on your friends and buddies. 
Also, consider the following: 
• J)on ', pretend to consult. If you've already made up your 
mind, don 't go through the charade of involving people, only 17 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
to do what you wanted to do all along. For example, the boss 
calls on people and then strikes down ideas that aren't in line 
with what he or she has in mind, while giving subtle clues and 
gentle rewards to those who stumble onto the "right idea ." 
• Anno unce what you 're doing. When you are only going to 
involve a sample of the people who will be affected, let others 
know who these people are so they can talk to them if they 
like. This is akin to holding neighborhood political meetings. 
Not everyone will show up, but people who want to take part 
can take part. 
• Report your decision. When others are kind enough to share 
their opinions (whether you take their advice or not), they 
deserve to know what you decide and why. Don't try to keep 
your decision a secret because you're afraid you'll offend peo­
ple. The y'll soon learn of the decision anyway. Better to hear 
it from you and not through the grapevine. 
Holding a Good Vote 
• Weigh the consequenc es. Vo ting by its very nature creates 
winners and losers. So you have to be careful. You should only 
take a vote when you know that the losers don't really care all 
that much. Otherwise you may be fighting the battle for a long 
time after the decision has been made. With children, for 
example, have them carefully consider if they're okay with los­
ing before they agree to have you take a poll. 
• Know when to vote. When matters aren't all that weighty, there 
are many good choices to select from, and people care about 
not taking too much time, then take a vote. It's the kind of thing 
you do to reduce lengthy lists. Vote to reduce the list of twenty 
items to five. Then use consensus to select from the five. MOVE TO ACTION 171 
• Don't cop out with a vote. When everyone cares a great deal 
about an issue and people are having trouble coming to a 
choice, don't stop and call for a vote. Vo tes should never replace 
patient analysis and healthy dialogue. If you find yourself say­
ing, "All right, we'll never agree so let's vote," you're copping 
out. 
Surviving the Joys of Consensus 
Imagine you're working with six people, all housed in a tight 
space. Things are sailing along smoothly until one day when a 
new employee shows up with a huge boom box-it looks like a 
storage shed with a handle on top. It has its own set of wheels. 
Thirty seconds later, the pulsing sounds of a band called Decibel 
Death fill your area. You're not happy. You fear your head will 
explode. How might you handle this? 
Or how about this challenge? How do you decide the temper­
ature of the room you share? 
Or how about this one? Where does the entire family go on 
vacation? 
Or if you want to take on a real corker-who performs the 
most distasteful jobs at home and at work? 
These are the kinds of decisions where neither consultation nor 
command tools work very well. Everyone is affected, everyone 
cares, and there are several options-not equally liked. This kind 
of crucial conversation calls for consensus. Everyone meets, hon­
estly and openly discusses the choices, comes up with a variety of 
ideas, and jointly makes a decision that each person agrees to sup­
port. As is the case with all crucial conversations, this is not an 
easy process and is routinely handled poorly. Here are some hints 
for avoiding common mistakes . 
• Don't force consensus onto everything. As Abraham Maslow 
once said, "If th e only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to 17 2 CRUCIAL CONVER SATIONS 
see every problem as a nail." Consensus decision making is 
one of today's widely used hamme rs. People apply it to situa­
tions that don't deserve the time and attention needed to come 
to a consensus or that can't be solved unanimously. 
For example, forty people are brought together to decide on 
the color of the work area. That's too many people. Use con­
sultation. A team meets to decide if each team member should 
use a certain type of coffee mug (we're not making this up) . 
Let people choose their own. A couple asks their son to decide 
his own punishment. Not always a good idea. Some decisions 
need to be made by command. 
• Don 't pretend that everyone gets his or her first choice. Nobody 
ever said that with consensus everyone gets his or her way. 
Consensus isn't about getting your way; it's about doing what's 
best for the family or team. It requires give and take. It demands 
compromise followed by the resolve to support (in some cases) 
your second or third choice-because it's best for the group. 
• No martyrs please. Healthy teams and families are good at 
coming to consensus because they're good at dialogue. They 
don't toggle from silence to violence or otherwise play games 
in order to get their way. Since everyone has a say and says it 
well, healthy groups don't end up with the same people con­
stantly giving in and then playing the role of mar tyr. "Are you 
enjoying the theme park? Don't worry about me. I'll just sit 
here on the curb and try to think of what it would have been 
like to go to Paris." 
• Don 't take turns. Decisions should be based on merit, not on 
who offers up the options. Don't take turns getting your way. 
"Well, Leona, my recollection is that you gave in last time, so 
I guess it's our turn to roll over on this one." Make the deci­
sion based on which proposal best meets the needs of the MOVE TO ACTION 17 3 
group. This doesn't mean that people don't take into account 
personalities or strength of desire (deferring to those who care 
a great deal when you don't care all that much, for instance) . 
It simply means that the future of your family or organization 
shouldn't come down to the flip of a coin. 
• Don 't engage in postdecision lobbying. Consensus decisions 
should be made out in the open and as an entire group. 
Withholding your reservations and then approaching individu­
als after the discussion is both inefficient and disloyal. If you 
have an issue, bring it up in front of the group. Leave unhealthy 
alliances, dirty deals, and secret discussions to people who are 
on reality game shows. They can afford to abuse one another, 
take their winnings, and then go their separate ways. With fam­
ilies and work groups, you stay together long after the ugly 
behavior and you suffer the long-term consequences . 
• Don 't say «[ told you so. " Nothing is quite so annoying as 
having someone agree on a choice (his or her second choice, 
perhaps) and then cry, "I told you so!" when it doesn't work 
out. Once you've decided on something as a group, support 
the idea-not even when it fails, but particularly when it fails. 
There's no room for fair-weather family members or team­
mates. Show character. When an idea doesn't work out, own 
the failure together. 
Advice for the Time-Bou nd 
There are times when you know you should involve others in a 
decision, but you absolutely have to make a decision by a certain 
time. Tn these cases, consider selecting a fallback decision-making 
plan. 
For example, you could announce: "W e have a critical deci­
sion 10 mak e that af fe ct s all of us, and it must be made by ten 17 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
sharp. I propose that we use consensus to decide. Howe ver, if by 
9:45 we have not come to consensus, then it will become a con­
sult decision. I will use your input, and I will decide." 
This strategy allows you to try for the optimum decision-mak­
ing method, but it leaves you a back door without making you 
look like a despot when time runs out. 
MAKI NG ASSIG NMEN TS-P UTTING DECI SIONS 
INTO ACTION 
Now let's take a look at the final step. You've engaged in healthy 
dialogue, filled the pool of meaning, decided how you're going 
to draw from the pool, and eventually come to some decisions . 
It's time to do something. Some of the items may have been 
completely resolved during the discussion, but many may 
require a person or team to do something. You'll have to make 
assignmen ts. 
As you might suspect, when you're involved with two or more 
people, there's a chance that there will be some confusion. To 
avoid common traps, make sure you consider the following four 
elements: 
• Who? 
• Does what? 
• By when? 
• How will you follow up? 
Who ? 
To quote an English proverb, "Everybody's business is nobody's 
business ." If you don't make an actual assignment to an actual 
person, there's a good chance that nothing will ever come of all 
the work you've gone through to make a decision. MOVE TO ACTION 1 75 
When it's time to pass out assignments, rememb er, there is no 
"we." "We," when it comes to assignments, actually means, "not 
me ." It's code. Even when individuals are not trying to duck an 
assignment, the term "we" can lead them to believe that others 
are taking on the responsibility. 
Assi gn a name to every responsibility. This especially applies 
at home. If you're divvying up household chores, be sure you've 
got a specific person to go with each chore. That is, if you assign 
two or three people to take on a task, appoint one of them the 
responsible party. Otherwise, any sense of responsibility will be 
lost in a flurry of finger-pointing later on. 
Does What ? 
Be sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The 
fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappoint­
ment. For example, the eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes 
once assigned a team of engineers to design and build the world's 
first steam-powered car. When sharing his dream of a vehicle that 
could run on heated water, he gave them virtually no direction. 
After several years of intense labor the engineers successfully 
produced the first prototype by running dozens of pipes through 
the car's body-thus solving the problem of where to put all the 
water required to run a steam-powered car. The vehicle was 
essentially a giant radiator. 
When Hughes asked the engineers what would happen if the 
car got into a wreck, they nervously explained that the passen­
gers would be boiled alive, much like lobsters in a pot. Hughes 
was so upset in what the crew came up with that he insisted they 
cut it up into pieces no larger than three inches. That was the 
cnd of the project. 
Lcarn from Hughes. When you're first agreeing on an assign­
mcnt, c la rify up front the exact details of what you want. 17 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties 
doesn't want to take the time to think carefully about the "deliv­
erables" and then later on becomes upset because his or her 
unstated desires weren't met. Have you ever remodeled a room 
with a loved one? Then you know what we're talking about. 
Better to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want 
rather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end. 
To help clarify deliverables, use Contrasting. If you've seen 
people misunderstand an assignment in the past, explain the 
common mistak e as an example of what you don't want. If pos­
sible, point to physical examples. Rather than talk in the 
abstract, bring a prototype or sample. We learned this particular 
trick when hiring a set designer. The renowned designer talked 
about what he would deliver, and it sounded great to us. Tw enty­
five thousand dollars later he delivered something that would 
never work. We had to start over from scratch. From that day on 
we've learned to point to pictures and talk about what we want 
and don't want. The clearer the picture of the deliverable, the 
less likely you'll be unpleasantly surprised. 
By When? 
It's shocking how often people leave this element out of an 
assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to 
the setting sun of "someday." With vague or unspoken deadlines, 
other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the 
bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments with­
out deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating 
action. Goals without deadlines aren't goals; they're merely 
directions. 
Ho w Will You Fo llow Up ? 
Always agree on how often and by what method you'll follow up 
on the assignment. It could be a simple ema il confirming the MOVE TO ACTION 17 7 
completion of a project. It might be a full report in a team or 
family meeting. More often than not, it comes down to progress 
checks along the way. 
It's actually fairly easy to build follow-up methods into the 
assignment. For example: "Call me on my cell phone when you 
finish your homework. Then you can go play with friends. 
Okay?" 
Or perhaps you'll prefer to rely on milestones: "Let me know 
when you've completed your library research. Then we'll sit down 
and look at the next steps." Milestones, of course, must be linked 
to a drop-dead date. "Let me know as soon you've completed the 
research component of this project. You've got until the last week 
in Novemb er, but if you finish earlier, give me a call." 
Remember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must 
give them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for 
follow-up into every assignment. 
DOCU MEN T YOUR WORK 
Once again, a proverb comes to mind. "One dull pencil is worth 
six sharp minds." Don't leave your hard work to memory. If 
you've gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, 
don't fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your 
memori es. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and 
assignments. Remember to record who does what by when. 
Revi sit your notes at key times (usually the next meeting) and 
review assignments. 
As you review what was supposed to be completed, hold peo­
ple accountable. When someone fails to deliver on a promi se, it's 
time for dialogue. Discuss the issue by using the STAT E skills we 
covered in Chapter 7. By holding people accountable, not only 
do you increase their motivation and ability to deliver on prom­
ises. but you create a cult ure of integrity. 17 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS

Tools for Preparing 
and Learning 
If you read the previous pages in a short period of time, you 
probably feel like an anaconda who just swallowed a warthog. 
It's a lot to digest. 
You may well be wondering at this point how you can possi­
bly keep all these ideas straight -especially during something as 
unpredictable and fast moving as a crucial conversation. 
This chapter will help with the daunting task of making dia­
logue tools and skills memorable and useable. First, we'll sim­
plify things by sharing what we've heard from people who have 
L:hanged their lives by using these skills. Second, we'll lay out a 
model that can help you visually organize the seven dialogue 
principles. Third, wc 'lI walk through an example of a crucial 
convcrsation wher e all th e dialogue principles are applied. 1 80 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
TWO LEVERS 
Over the years, people often tell us that the principles and skills 
contained in this book have helped them a great deal. But how? 
In what way can the printed word lead to important changes? 
After watching people at home and at work, as well as inter­
viewing them, we've learned that most people make progress not 
by focusing on specific skills-at least to start with-but instead 
by applying two of the main principles in this book. We hope 
that as we share their success strategies with you, you'll feel 
more confident getting started on the road to improved results 
and relationships. 
Learn to Look. The first lever for positive change is Learn to 
Look. That is, people who improve their dialogue skills continu­
ally ask themselves whether they're in or out of dialogue. This 
alone makes a huge difference. Even people who can't remember 
or never learned the skills of STATE or CRIB, etc., are able to 
benefit from this material by simply asking if they're falling into 
silence or violence. They may not know exactly how to fix the 
specific problem they're facing, but they do know that if they're 
not in dialogue, it can't be good. And then they try something to 
get back to dialogue. As it turns out, trying something is better 
than doing nothing. 
So remember to ask the following important question: "Are 
we playing games or are we in dialogue?" It's a wonderful start. 
Many people get additional help in learning to look from their 
friends. They go through training as families or teams. As they 
share concepts and ideas, they learn a common vocabulary. This 
shared way of talking about crucial conversations helps people 
change. 
Perhaps the most common way that the language of dialogue 
finds itself into everyday conversation is with the expression, "I PUITING IT ALL TOGETHER 181 
think we've moved away from dialogue." This simple reminder 
helps people catch themselves early on, before the damage is severe. 
As we've watched executive teams, work groups, and couples sim­
ply go public with the fact that they're starting to move toward 
silence or violence, others often recognize the problem and take 
corrective action. "You're right. I'm not telling you what needs to 
be said," or "I'm sorry. I have been trying to force my ideas on you." 
Make It Safe. The second lever is Make It Safe. We've sug­
gested that dialogue consists of the free flow of meaning and that 
the number one flow stopper is a lack of safety. When you notice 
that you and others have moved away from dialogue, do some­
thing to make it safer. Anything. We've suggested a few skills, 
but those are merely a handful of common practices. Th ey're not 
im mutable principles. To no one's surprise, there many things 
you can do to increase safety. If you simply realize that your chal­
lenge is to make it safer, nine out of ten times you'll intuitively 
do something that helps. 
Sometimes you'll build safety by asking a question and show­
ing interest in others' views. Sometimes an appropriate touch 
(with loved ones and family members-not at work where 
touching can equate with harassment) can communicate safety. 
Apologies, smiles, even a request for a brief "time out" can help 
restore safety when things get dicey. The main idea is to make it 
safe. Do something to make others comfortable. And remember, 
virtually every skill we've covered in this book, from Contrasting 
to CRIB, offers a tool for building safety. 
These two levers form the basis for recognizing, building, and 
maintaining dialogue. When the concept of dialogue is intro­
duced, these are the ideas most people can readily take in and 
apply to crucial conversations. Now let's move on to a discussion 
uf the rest of the principles we've covered. 1 82 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
A MODEL OF DIALOGUE 
To help organize our thinking and to make it easier to recall the 
principles (and when to apply the m), let's look at the model 
shown in Figure 10-1. It begins with concentric circles-like a 
target. Notice that the center circle is the Pool of Shared 
Meaning -it's the center of the target, or the aim of dialogue. 
When meaning flows freely, it finds its way into this pool, which 
represents people's best collective thinking. 
Surrounding the Pool of Shared Meaning is safety. Safety 
allows us to share meaning and keeps us from moving into 
silence or violence. When conversations become crucial, safety 
must be strong. 
Watch for games. Next you'll notice that we've portrayed the 
behaviors to watch when thinking about safety. These are the six 
silence and violence behaviors we look for in others and in out-
Figur e 10 -1. The Dialogue Model PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 18 3 
Figur e 10 -2. The Dialogue Model 
breaks of our own Style Under Stress. When we see these or sim­
ilar behaviors, we know that safety is weak. This is a cue to step 
out of the content of the conversation, strengthen safety, and 
then step back in. Remember, don't back away or weaken the 
argument. Just rebuild safety. Do it quickly. The further you 
move from dialogue into silence or violence, the harder it is to 
get back and the greater the costs. 
Now, let's add people to our model. 
Me and Others. (Figure 10-2). You are the "ME" arrow on the 
model. Others are included in the "OTHER" arrow. The arrows 
(both pointed to the center of the pool) show that both we and 
others are in dialogue. All our meaning is flowing freely into the 
shared pool. Learn to Look means we watch for when either of 
these two arrows begins to point upward or downward, toward 
silence or violence. When this happens, either you or others are 
starting to play games. 
Watching and building conditions. (Figure 10-3). When you 
sec yourself driftin g to si kncc or violence, Start with Heart. Keep 18 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSA TIONS 
Figur e 10-3. The Dialogue Model 
yourself in dialogue by focusing on what you really want and then 
behaving as if you really do want it. A void the Sucker's Choices 
that make it appear as if silence and violence are the only options. 
When your emotions start running strong and taking control of 
the conversation, use the Master My Stories principle to bring 
your arrow back to the Pool of Shared Meaning. Retrace your Path 
to Action, watch for clever stories, and tell the rest of the story. 
When others move to silence or violence, Make It Safe. As we 
strengthen safety, others are more likely to lay aside their silence 
and violence and move back toward dialogue in the center. 
What to do. The next three principles teach us what to do with 
our meaning. First, we learned to STATE My Path. We share our 
own sensitive or controversial views by following our Path to 
Action . We share the facts first and then tentatively share our 
story. We then demonstrate we're serious about dialogue by 
encouraging others to share their story (Figure 10-4 )-especially 
if it's different from our own. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 18 5 
Figure 10 -4. The Dialogue Model 
To help others share their meaning, we Explore Others' Paths. 
We ask, mirror, paraphrase, and prime (AMPP) as needed to get 
to their feelings, stories, and facts. As we use these skills effec­
tively, we demonstrate that their concerns are discussable-that 
dialogue can actually work. This helps others feel safer sur­
rendering their silence and violence and joining us in dialogue. 
Finally, with the Pool of Shared Meaning full, we Move to 
Action. We ensure that we are clear about how decisions are 
being made and about what the decisions are. And we follow up 
to ensure that dialogue leads to positive actions and results. 
You can use the Dialogue Model first to diagnose what's going 
un. Remember to ask: "Where am I?" ''Where are others?" "Are we 
in dialogue or in some form of silence or violence?" 
Next ask, "Where do I want to be?" "Where do I want others to 
be?" The principles and tools become the methods and means to 
get to dialogue. 18 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS

We've included an extended case here to show how these prin­
ciples might look when you find yourself in the middle of a cru­
cial conversation. It outlines a tough discussion between you 
and your sister about dividing your mother's estate. The case is 
set up to illustrate where the principles apply, and to briefly 
review each principle as it comes up in the conversation. 
The conversation begins with you bringing up the family sum­
merhouse. Your mother's funeral was a month ago, and now it's 
time to split up both money and keepsakes. You're not really 
looking forward to it. 
The issue is made touchier by the fact that you feel that since 
you almost single-handedly cared for your mother during the 
last several years, you should be compensated. You don't think 
your sister will see things the same way. 
Your Cru cial Co nversati on 
YOU: We have to sell the summer cottage. We never use it, 
and we need the cash to pay for my expenses from taking 
care of Mom the past four years. pum N G IT ALL TOG ETH ER 1 89 
SISTER: Please don't start with the guilt. I sent you money 
every month to help take care of Mom. If I didn't have 
to travel for my jobs, you know I would have wanted her 
at my house. 
You notice that emotions are already getting strong. You're 
getting defensive, and your sister seems to be angry. You're in a 
crucial conversation, and it's not going well. 
Start with Heart 
Ask yourself what you really want. You want to be compensated 
fairly for the extra time and money you put in that your sister 
didn't. You also want to keep a good relationship with your sister. 
But you want to avoid making a Sucker's Choice. So you ask 
yourself: "Ho w can I tell her that I want to be compensated 
fairly for the extra effort and expense I put in and keep a good 
relationship?" 
Learn to Look 
You recognize a lack of Mutual Purpose-you're both trying to 
defend your actions rather than discuss the estate. 
Make It Safe 
Contrast to help your sister understand your purpose. 
YOU: I don't want to start an argument or try to make you 
feel guilty. But I do want to talk about being compensated 
for shouldering most of the responsibility over the last few 
years. I love Mom, but it put quite a strain on me finan­
cially and emotionally. 
SISTER: What makes you think you did so much more than I 
did? 19 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Master My Stories 
You're telling yourself that you deserve more because you did 
more to care for your mother and covered unplanned expenses. 
Retrace your Path to Action to find out what facts are behind the 
story you're telling that's making you angry. 
STATE My Path 
You need to share your facts and conclusions with your sister in 
a way that will make her feel safe telling her story. 
YOU: It's just that I spent a lot of money taking care of Mom 
and did a lot of work caring for her instead of bringing in 
a nurse. I know you cared about Mom too, but I honestly 
feel like I did more in the day-to-day caregiving than you 
did, and it only seems fair to use some of what she left us 
to repay a part of what I spent. Do you see it differently? 
I'd really like to hear. 
SISTER: Okay, fine. Why don't you just send me a bill. 
It sounds as though your sister isn't really okay with this 
arrangement. You can tell her voice is tense and her tone is one 
of giving in, not of true agreement. 
Explore Others' Paths 
Since part of your objective is to maintain a good relationship 
with your sister, it's important that she add her meaning to the 
pool. Use the AMPP skills to actively explore her views. 
YOU: The way you say that makes it sound like maybe that 
suggestion isn't okay with you. [Mirror] Is there some­
thing I'm missing? [Ask] 
SISTER: No-if you feel like you deserve more than I do, 
you're probably right. PUTTI NG IT ALL TOGETH ER 1 91 
You: Do you think I'm being unfair? That I'm not acknowl­
edging your contributions? [Prime] 
SISTER: It's just that I know I wasn't around much in the last 
couple of years. I've had to travel a lot for work. But I still 
visited whenever I could, and I sent money every month 
to help contribute to Mom's care. I offered to help pay to 
bring in a nurse if you thought it was necessary. I didn't 
know you felt you had an unfair share of the responsibil­
ity, and it seems like your asking for more money is com­
ing out of nowhere. 
You: So you feel like you were doing everything you could 
to help out and are surprised that I feel like I should be 
compensated? [Paraphrase] 
SISTER: Well, yes. 
Explore Others' Paths 
You understand your siste r's story now and still disagree to a 
point. Use the ABC skills to explain how your view differs. You 
agree in part with how your sister sees things. Use building to 
emphasize what you agree with and to bring up what you dif­
fer on. 
You: You're right. You did a lot to help out, and I realize 
that it was expensive to visit as often as you did. I opted 
not to pay for professional home health care because 
Mom was more comfortable with me taking care of her, 
and I didn't mind that. On top of that, there were some 
incidental expenses it doesn't sound like you were aware 
of. The new medication she was on during the last eight­
een months was twice as expensive as the old, and the 
insurance only covered a percentage of her hospital stays. 
It adds up. 19 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
SISTER: So it's these expenses you're worried about cover­
ing? Could we go over these expenses to decide how to 
cover them? 
Move to Action 
You want to create a definite plan for being reimbursed for these 
expenses, and you want it to be one you both agree on. Come to 
a consensus about what will happen, and document who does 
what by when, and settle on a way to follow up. 
You : I've kept a record of all the expenses that went over 
the amount that both of us agreed to contribute. Can we 
sit down tomorrow to go over those and talk about what's 
fair to reimburse me for? 
SISTER: Okay. We'll talk about the estate and write up a plan 
for how to divide things up. 
SUM MARY- PUTTING IT All TOGETHER 
If we first learn to recognize when safety is at risk and a conver­
sation becomes crucial (Learn to Look) and that we need to take 
steps to Make It Safe for everyone to contribute his or her mean­
ing, we can begin to see where to apply the skills we've learned. 
A visual model can also help us see where the principles and 
skills are needed. 
Using these tools and reminders will get us started in master­
ing the skills that help us improve our crucial conversations. 11 
A man surprised is half beaten. 
-THOMAS FULLER 
Yeah, Bu t 
Advice for Tough Cases 
As we (the authors) have taught this material, we've grown 
accustomed to people saying, "Yeah, but my situation's more dif­
ficult than that!" Or "Yeah, but the people I deal with aren't so 
quick to come around. Besides, most of the problems I face come 
as a surprise. I'm caught off guard." In short, people can think 
of a dozen reasons why the skills we've been talking about don't 
apply to the situations they care about. 
• "Yeah, but what if someone does something that's really sub­
tle? It drives you crazy but it's hard to identify. How do you 
handle that?" 
• "Yeah, but what if my life partner refuses to ever talk about 
anything imp urt ant? You can't force a person into dialogue." 19 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
• "Yeah, but what if I can't calm down quickly enough? I've 
been told not to go to bed angry, but sometimes I think I need 
time alone. What should I do?" 
• "Yeah, but what if I don't trust the other person? How am I 
supposed to deal with that?" 
• "Yeah, but both my boss and spouse are too sensitive to take 
any feedback. Shouldn't I just let things slide?" 
In truth, the dialogue skills we've shared apply to just about 
any problem you can imagi ne. However, since some are more dif­
ficult than others, we've chosen seventeen tough cases. We'll 
take a moment to share a thought or two on each. 
SEXUAL OR OTHER HARASSM ENT 
"YEAH I 
BUT... 
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE'S BLATANTLY harassing me or 
anything, but I don't like the way I'm being tre ated. 
How can I bring it up without making enemies?" 
The Danger Point 
Someone is making comments or gestures that you find offen­
sive. The person does it seldom enough and he or she's subtle 
enough that you're not sure if HR or your boss can even help. 
What can you do? 
In these situations it's easy to think that the offender has all 
the power. It seems as if the rules of polite society make it so that 
others can behave inappropriately and you end up looking like 
you're overreacting if you bring it up. 
Generally speaking, a vast maj ority of these problems go away 
if they're privately, respectfully, and firmly discussed. Your 
biggest challenge will be the respect part. If you put up with this 
behavior for too long, you'll be inclined to tell a more and more 
potent Vi llain Story about the offender. This will jack up your YEAH, BUT 19 5 
emotions to the point that you'll go in with guns blazing-even 
if only through your body language. 
The So lution 
Te ll the rest of the story. If you've tolerated the behavior for a long 
time before holding the conversation, own up to it. This may help 
you treat the individual like a reasonable, rational, and decent 
person-even if some of his or her behavior doesn't fit this 
description. 
When you feel a measure of respect for the other person, 
you're ready to begin. After establishing a Mutual Purpose for 
the exchange, ST ATE your path. For example: 
''I'd like to talk about something that's getting in the way of 
my working with you. It's a tough issue to bring up, but I 
think it'll help us be better teammates if I do. Is that okay?" 
[Establish Mutual Pur pose] 
"When I walk into your office, sometimes your eyes 
move up and down my body. And when I sit next to you at 
a computer, sometimes you put your arm around the back 
of my chair. I don't know that you're aware you're doing 
these things, so I thought I'd bring them up because they 
send a mess age that makes me uncomfortable. How do you 
see it?" [STATE My Path] 
If you can be respectful and private but firm in this conversa­
tion, most problem behavior will stop. And remember , if the 
behavior is over the line, you shouldn't hesitate to contact HR to 
ensure your rights and dignity are protected. 
MY OVERLY SENSI TIVE SPOUSE 
"YEAH, 
BUT ... 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN your spouse is too sensitive? You 
try to give him or her some cons tructive feedbac k, but he 
or she (('(Je/<, "(J \I rorrgly that you end up going to silence. " 19 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The Danger Point 
Often couples come to an unspoken agreement during the first 
year or so of their marriage that affects how they communicate 
for the rest of their marriage. Say one person is touchy and 
can't take feedback, or the other doesn't give it very well. In 
any case, they in effect agree to say nothing to each other. They 
live in silence. Problems have to be huge before they're dis­
cussed. 
The So lut ion 
This is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE 
your path. When someth ing bothers you, catch it early. 
Contrasting can also help. "I'm not trying to blow this out of 
proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of 
hand." Describe the specific behaviors you've obse rved. 
"When Jimmy leaves his room a mess, you use sarcasm to get 
his attention. You call him a 'pig' and then laugh as if you 
didn't mean it." Te ntatively explain the consequences. "I don't 
think it's having the effect you want. He doesn't pick up on the 
hint, and I'm afraid that he's starting to resent you" (Your 
story). Encourage testing: "Do you see it differently?" 
Finally, Learn to Look for signs that safety is at risk, and Make 
It Safe. When you ST ATE things well and others become defen­
sive, refuse to conclude that the issue is impossible to discuss. 
Think harder about your approach. Step out of the content, do 
what it takes to make sure your partner feels safe, and then try 
again to candidly ST AT E your view. 
When spouses stop giving each other helpful feedback, they 
lose out on the help of a lifelong confidant and coach. They miss 
out on hundreds of opportunities to help each other communicate 
more effectively. YEAH, BUT 19 7 
FAilURE TO LIVE UP TO AGREEMENTS 
nYEAH, 
BUT... 
MY TEAMMATES ARE hypocrites. We get together and 
talk about all the ways we could improve, but then 
people don't do what they agreed to. " 
The Danger Point 
The worst teams walk away from problems like these. In good 
teams, the boss eventually deals with problem behavior. In the 
best teams, every team member is part of the system of account­
ability. If team members see others violate a team agreement, 
they speak up immediately and directly. It's dangerous to wait for 
or expect the boss to do what good teammates should do them­
selves. 
The So lution 
If your teammate isn't doing what you think he or she should, it's 
up to you to speak up. 
We realized this after watching a group of executives that 
agreed they'd hold off on all discretionary spending to help free 
up cash for a short-term crunch. This strategy sounded good in 
the warm glow of an off-site meeting, but the very next day a 
team member rushed back and prepaid a vendor for six months 
of consulting work-work that appeared to be "disc retionary." 
A team member who saw the executive prepare for and then 
make the prepayment didn't realize this was the crucial conver­
sation that would determine whether the team would pull 
together or fall apart on this issue. Instead, he decided it was up 
to the boss to hold this person accountable. He said nothing. By 
the time the boss found out about the transaction and addressed 
the issue. the policy had already been violated and the money 19 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
spent. Motivation to support the new plan dissipated, and the 
team ran short of cash. 
When teams try to rally around aggressive change or bold new 
initiatives, they need to be prepared to address the problem 
when a team member doesn't live up to the agreement. Success 
does not depend on perfect compliance with new expectations, 
but on teammates who hold crucial conversations with one 
another when others appear to be reverting to old patterns. 
DEFERENC E TO AUTH ORITY 
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME FILTER WHAT they say by 
gue ssing what they think I'm willing to hear. They take 
"YEAH, 
BU T ... little initiative in solving import ant problems because 
they' re afraid 1'1/ disagree with them. " 
The Danger Point 
When leaders face deference-or what feels like kissi ng up­
they typically make one of two mistak es. Either they misdiagnose 
the cause (fear), or they try to banish deference with a brash 
command. 
Misdiagn ose. Often, leaders are causing the fear but denying 
it. "Who me? I don't do a thing to make people feel uncomfort­
able." They haven't Learned to Look. Th ey're unaware of their 
Style Under Stress. Despite this disclaimer, the way they carry 
themselves, their habit of speaking in absolutes, their subtle use 
of authority-something out there-is creating fear and eventual 
deference. 
Then there's the other misdiagn osis: leaders who face "head­
bobbing kiss-ups" often think they're doing something wrong 
when, in fact, they're living with ghosts of previous leaders. They 
do their best to be open and supportive and to involve people, YEAH, BUT 19 9 
but despite their genuine efforts, people still keep their distance. 
Often, people treat their leaders like celebrities or dictators, 
regardless of the fact that they've done nothing to deserve it. 
Before you do anything, you need to find out if you're the 
cause, if you're living with ghosts of bosses past, or both. 
Command it away. Many leaders seek the simple path. They 
tell people to stop deferring. 
"It seems to me that you're agreeing with me because I'm 
the boss and not because what I'm saying makes sense." 
"Absolutely!" 
"I'd prefer that you stop deferring to me and simply listen 
to the idea." 
"Okay. whatever you say, Boss !" 
With ingrained deference you face a catch-22. If you don't say 
something, it'll probably continue. If you do say something, you 
may be inadvertently encouraging it to continue. 
The Solut ion 
Work on me first. Discover your part in the problem. Don't ask 
your direct reports. If they're already deferring to you, they'll 
whitewash the problem. Consult with a peer who watches you in 
action. Ask for honest feedback. Are you doing things that cause 
people to defer to you? If so, what? Explore your peer's path by 
having him or her point out your specific behaviors. Jointly devel­
op a plan of attack, work on it, and seek continued feedback. 
If the problem stems from ghosts (the actions of previous 
leaders), go public. Describe the problem in a group or team 
meeting and then ask for advice. Don't try to command it away. 
You can't. Reward risk takers. Encourage testing. When people 
do express an opinion contrary to yours, thank them for their 
honesty. Play de vil' s advocate. If you can't get others to disagree, 200 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
then disagree with yourself. Let people know that all ideas are 
open to question. If you need to, leave the room. Give people 
some breathing space. 
FAILED TRUST 
n YEA H, 
BUT. .. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT to do. I'm not sure I can trust this 
person. He missed an import ant deadline. Now I wonder 
if I sho uld trus t him again. " 
The Danger Point 
People often assume that trust is something you have or don't 
have. Either you trust someone or you don't. That puts too much 
pressure on trust. "What do you mean I can't stay out past mid­
night? Don't you trust me?" your teenage son inquires. 
Tr ust doesn't have to be universally offered. In truth, it's usu­
ally offered in degrees and is very topic specific. It also comes in 
two flavors-motive and ability. For example, you can trust me 
to administer CPR if needed; I'm motivated. But you can't trust 
me to do a good job; I know nothing about it. 
The Solution 
Deal with trust around the issue, not around the person. 
When it comes to regaining trust in others, don't set the bar 
too high. Just try to trust them in the moment, not across all 
issues. You don't have to trust them in everything. To make it 
safe for yourself in the moment, bring up your concerns. 
Te ntatively STATE what you see happening. "I get the sense that 
you're only sharing the good side of your plan. I need to hear the 
possible risks before I'm comfortable. Is that okay?" If they play 
games, call them on it. YEAH. BUT 201 
Also, don't use your mistrust as a club to punish people. If 
they've earned your mistrust in one area, don't let it bleed over 
into your overall perception of their character. If you tell yourself 
a Vi llain Story that exaggerates others' untrustworthiness, you'll 
act in ways that help them justify themselves in being even less 
worthy of your trust. You'll start up a self-defeating cycle and get 
more of what you don 't want. 
WON' T TALK ABOUT ANYTH IN G SERIOUS 
MY SPOUSE IS THE person you talked about earlier. Yo u 
know, I try to hold a me aningful discussion, I try to 
lIYEAH, 
BUT. .. work through an import ant problem, and he or she 
simply withdraws. What can I do?" 
The Danger Point 
It's common to blame others for not wanting to stay in dia­
logue as if it were some kind of genetic diso rder. That's not the 
problem. If others don't want to talk about tough issues, it's 
because they believe that it won't do any good. Either they 
aren't good at dialogue, or you aren't, or you both aren't-or 
so they think. 
The Solut ion 
Work on me first. Your spouse may have an aversion to all cru­
cial conversations, even when talking to a skilled person. 
Nevertheless, you're still the only person you can work on. Start 
with simple challenges. Don't go for the really tough issues. Do 
your best to Make It Safe. Constantly watch to see when your 
spouse starts to become uncomfortable. Use tentative language. 
Separate intent from outcome. "" m pretty sure you're not intend-202 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
ing to ... " If your spouse consistently seems unwilling to talk 
about his or her personal issues, learn how to Explore Others' 
Paths. Practice these skills every chance you get. In short, start 
simply and then bring all your dialogue tools into play. 
Now, having said all of this, exercise patience. Don't nag. 
Don't lose hope and then go to violence. Every time you become 
aggressive or insulting, you give your spouse additional evidence 
that crucial conversations do nothing but cause harm. 
If you're constantly on your best dialogue behavior, you'll 
build more safety in the relationship and your spouse will be 
more likely to begin picking up on the cues and start coming 
around. 
When you see signs of improveme nt, you can accelerate the 
growth by inviting your spouse to talk with you about how you 
talk. Your challenge here is to build safety by establishing a 
compelling Mutual Purpose. You need to help your partner see a 
reason for having this conversation-a reason that is so com­
pelling that he or she will be willing to take part. 
Share what you think the consequences of having or not hav­
ing this conversation could be (both positive and negative). 
Explain what it means to both you and the relationship. Then 
invite your spouse to help identify the topics you have a hard 
time discussing. Ta ke turns describing how you both tend to 
approach these topics. Then discuss the possible benefits of help­
ing each other make improvem ents. 
Sometimes if you can't talk about the tough topics, you can 
more easily talk about how you talk-or don't talk-about them. 
That helps get things started. 
VAGUE BUT ANNO YI NG 
"YEAH, 
BUT. .. 
THE PERSON I'M THINKING OF doesn't do blatantly 
unac ceptable things-n o thing to write home about­
just subt le stuff that's starting to drive me cra zy. " The Danger Point 
If people simply bother you at some abstract level, maybe what 
they're doing isn't worthy of a conversation. Perhaps the prob­
lem is not their behavior but your tolerance. For example, an 
executive laments, "My employees really disappoint me. Just 
look at the length of their hair." It turns out that the employees 
in question have no contact with anyone besides one another. 
Their hair length has nothing to do with job performance. The 
boss really has no reason to say anything. 
However, when actions are both subtle and unacceptable, 
then you have to retrace your Path to Action and put your finger 
on exactly what others are doing or you have nothing to discus s. 
Abs tract descriptions peppered with your vague conclusions or 
stories have no place in crucial conversations. For example, 
whenever your family gets together, your brother constantly 
takes potshots at everyone else using sarcastic humor. The indi­
vidual comments aren't directly insulting enough to discuss. 
What you want to talk about is the fact that these constant com­
ments make every get-together feel negative. Remember, clarify­
ing the facts is the homework required for crucial conversations. 
The Solution 
Retrace your Path to Action to its source. Identify specific behaviors 
that are out of bounds and take note. When you've done your home­
work, consider the behaviors you noted and make sure the story 
you're telling yourself about these behaviors is important enough for 
dialogue. If it is, then Make It Safe and STATE Your Path. 
SHO WS NO IN ITIATIVE 
SOME MEMBERS OF MY WORK TEAM do what they' re 
asked, but no more. If they run into a probl em, they 
"YEAH, 
BUT. .. lak e' one simple slab at fixing it. But if their efforts 
don't pay ofr, thc'y qlli t." 204 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The Dang er Point 
Most people are far more likely to talk about the presence of a 
bad behavior than the absence of a good one. When someone 
really messes up, leaders and parents alike are compelled to take 
action. However, when people simply fail to be excellent, it's 
hard to know what to say. 
The Solution 
Establish new and higher expectations. Don't deal with a specific 
instance; deal with the overall pattern. If you want someone to 
show more initiative, tell him or her. Give specific examples of 
when the person ran into a barrier and then backed off after a 
single try. Raise the bar and then make it crystal clear what 
you've done. Jointly brainstorm what the person could have done 
to be both more persistent and more creative in coming up with 
a solution. 
For instance, "I asked you to finish up a task that absolutely 
had to be completed before I returned from a trip. You ran into 
a problem, tried to get in touch with me, and then simply left a 
message with my four-year-old. What could you have done to 
track me down on the road?" or "What would it have taken to 
create a backup strategy?" 
Pay attention to ways you are compensating for someone's 
lack of initiative. Have you made yourself responsible for fol­
lowing up? If so, talk with that person about assuming this 
responsibility. Have you asked more than one person to take the 
same assignment so you can be sure it will get done? If so, talk 
to the person originally assigned about reporting progress to you 
early so you only need to put someone else on the job when 
there's a clear need for more resources. 
Stop acting out your expectations that others won't take initia­
tive. Instead, talk your expectations out and come to agreements YEAH, BUT 205 
that place the responsibility on the team members while giving 
you information early enough that you aren't left high and dry. 
SH OWS A PATTERN 
IT ISN'T A SINGLE PROBLEM. It's that I keep having to 
talk with people about the same problem. I feel like I 
u YEA H, 
BUT... have to choose between bei ng a nag and putt ing up 
with the problem. Now what?" 
The Danger Point 
Some crucial conversations go poorly because you're having the 
wrong conversations. You talk to someone who is late for a 
meeting for the second time, Then the third. Your blood begins 
to boil. Then you bite your lip and give another gentle reminder. 
Finally, after your resentment builds up (because you're telling 
yourself an ugly story), you become violent. You make a sarcas­
tic or cutting comment and then end up looking stupid because 
the reaction seems way out of line given the minor offense. 
If you continue to return to the original problem (coming in 
late) without talking about the new problem (failing to live up to 
commitme nts), you're stuck in "Groundhog Day." We talk about 
this problem using the Groundhog Day movie metaphor. If you 
return to the same initial problem, you're like Bill Murray in the 
movie-you're forced to relive the same situation over and over 
rather than deal with the bigger problem. Nothing ever gets 
resolved. 
The Solution 
Learn to Loo k for patterns. Don't focus exclusively on a single 
event. Watch fol' behavior over time. Then STATE Your Path by 
talkin g about th (: pu1 t(:rn, Por example, if a person is late for 206 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
meetings and agrees to do better, the next conversation should 
not be about tardiness. It should be about his or her failure to 
keep a commitme nt. This is a bigger issue. It's now about trust 
and respect. 
People often become far more emotional than the issue they're 
discussing warrants because they're talking about the wrong 
issue. If you're really bothered because of a pattern, but you're 
talking about this latest instance, your emotions will seem out of 
proportion. In contrast, an interesting thing happens when you 
hold the right conversation. Your emotions calm down. When 
you talk about what's really eating you-the pattern-you'll be 
able to be more composed and effective. 
Don't get pulled into any one instance or your concern will 
seem trivial. Talk about the overall pattern. 
I NEED TIME TO CALM DOWN ! 
"YEAH, 
BUT ... 
IVE BEEN TOLD THAT I sho uld never go to bed angry. Is 
that always a good idea?" 
The Danger Point 
Once you've become angry, it's not always easy to calm down. 
You've told yourself an ugly story, your body has responded by 
preparing for a fight, and now you're trying your best not to 
duke it out-only your body hasn't caught up with your brain. 
So what do you do? Do you try to stay in dialogue even though 
your intuition tells you to back off and buy some time? After all, 
Mom said, "Never go to bed angry." 
The Solution 
Okay, so your mom wasn't exactly right. She was right by sug­
gesting that you shouldn't let serious problems go unresolved. YEAH, BUT 207 
She was wrong about always sticking with a discussion, no mat­
ter your emotional state. It's perfectly okay to suggest that you 
need some time alone and that you'd like to pick up the discus­
sion later on-say, tomo rrow. Then, after you've dissipated the 
adrenaline and have had time to think about the issues, hold the 
conversation. Coming to mutual agreement to take a time-out is 
not the same thing as going to silence. In fact, it's a very healthy 
example of dialogue. 
As a sidenote on this topic, it's not such a good idea to tell oth­
ers that they need to calm down or that they need to take some 
time out. They may need the time, but it's hard to suggest it with­
out coming off as patronizing. "Take ten minutes, calm down, 
and then get back to me." With others, get back to the source of 
their anger. Retrace their Path to Action. 
END LESS EXCUSES 
"YEAH, 
BUT ... 
MY TEENAGE SON is a master of exc uses. I talk to him 
about a problem, and he' s always got a new re ason 
why it's not his fault. " 
The Danger Point 
It's easy to be lulled into a series of never-ending excuses-par­
ticularly if the other person doesn't want to do what you've 
asked and learns that as long as he or she can give you a plausi­
ble reason, all bets are off. 
"I go to work before my son leaves for school, and he's con­
stantly late. First he told me that he was late because his 
alarm broke. The next day the old car we bought him had 
a problem-or so he says. Then his friend forgot to pick 
him up. Then he had a hl!ad cold and couldn't hear his new 
a I" 1'1ll . Thl!11 . . . " 208 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The Solution 
With "imaginative" people, take a preemptive strike against all new 
excuses. Gain a commitment to solve the overall problem, not sim­
ply the stated cause. For instance, the first time the person is late, 
seek a commitment to fix the alarm-and anything else that might 
stand in the way. Repairing the alarm only deals with one potential 
cause. Ask the person to deal with the problem-being late. 
"So you think that if you get a new alarm, you'll be able to 
make it to school on time? That's fine with me. Do what­
ever it takes to get there on time. Can I count on you being 
there tomorrow at eight o'clock sharp?" 
Then remember, as the excuses accumulate, don't talk about the 
most recent excuse; talk about the pattern. 
INSUBORDI NATION (OR OVER-TH E-LINE DlSRESPEcn 
IIYEAH, 
BUT ... 
WHAT IF THE PEOPLE you talk to not only are angry. but 
also become insubor dinate? How do you handle that?" 
The Danger Point 
When you're discus sing a tough issue with employees (or even 
your kids ), there's always the chance they'll step over the line. 
They 'll move from a friendly dispute to a heated discussion and 
then into the nasty territory of being insubordinate or acting dis­
respectful. 
The trouble is, insubordination is so rare that it takes most 
leaders by surprise. So they buy time to figure out what to do. 
And in so doing, they let the person get away with something 
that was way out of line. Worse still, their perceived indifference 
makes them an accomplice to all future abuses. Parents, on the YEAH, BUT 209 
other hand, caught by surprise, tend to respond in kind, becom­
ing angry and insulting. 
The Solution 
Show zero tolerance for insubordination. Speak up immediat ely, 
but respectfully. Change topics from the issue at hand to how the 
person is currently acting. Catch the escalating disrespect before 
it turns into abuse and insubordination . Let the person know 
that his or her passion for the issue at hand is leading down a 
dangerous trail. "I'd like to step away from this scheduling issue 
for a moment-then we'll come right back to it. The way you're 
leaning in toward me and raising your voice seems disrespec tful. 
I want to help address your concerns, but I'm going to have a 
tough time doing so if this continues." 
If you can't catch it early, discuss the insubordination and seek 
help from HR specialists. 
REGRETTING SAYING SOM ETHING HORRIBL E 
nYEAH, 
BUT ... 
SOMETIMES I LET A PROBLEM go fo r a long time, and 
then when I bring it up, I say some thing just awful. 
How do I re cover from this?" 
The Danger Point 
When other people do things that bother us, and then we tell 
ourselves a story about how they're bad and wrong, we're setting 
ourselves up for an unhealthy conversation. Of course, when we 
tell ourselves an ugly story and then sit on it, it only gets worse. 
Stories left unattended don't get better with time-they ferment. 
Then, when we eventually can't take it anymore, we say some­
thing we regret. 210 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The Solution 
First, don't repress your story. Use your ST AT E skills early on, 
before the story turns too ugly. Second, if you have let the prob­
lem build, don't hold the crucial conversation while angry. Set 
aside a time when you can discuss it in a calm fashion. Then, 
using your ST AT E skills, explain what you've seen and heard, 
and tentatively tell the most simple and least offensive story. 
"The way you just told me that our neighbor thinks I'm a real 
idiot has me worried. You smiled and laughed when you said it. 
I'm beginning to wonder if you take pleasure in running to me 
with negative feedback. Is that what's going on?" 
If you do say something horrible-"You're cruel, you know 
that? You love to hurt me and I'm sick of it" -apologize. You 
can't uming the bell, but you can apologize. Then STATE Your 
Path. 
TOUCHY AND PERSONAL 
IlYEAH, 
BUT... 
WHAT IF SOMEONE has a hygiene problem? Or maybe 
someo ne' s bor ing and people avoid him or her. How 
could you ever talk about somet hing personal and 
sensitive like that?" 
The Danger Point 
Most people avoid sensitive issues like the plague. Who can blame 
them? Unfortunately, when fear and misapplied compassion rule 
over honesty and courage, people can go for years without being 
given information that could be extremely helpful. 
When people do speak up, they often leap from silence to vio­
lence. Jokes, nicknames, and other veiled attempts to sneak in 
vague feedback are both indirect and disrespectful. Also, the YEAH, BUT 211 
longer you go without saying anything, the greater the pain when 
you finally deliver the message. 
The So lution 
Use Contrasting. Explain that you don't want to hurt the person's 
feelings, but you do want to share something that could be help­
ful. Establish Mutual Purpose. Let the other person know your 
intentions are honorable. Also explain that you're reluctant to 
bring up the issue because of its personal nature, but since the 
problem is interfering with the person's effectiveness, you really 
must. Te ntatively describe the problem. Don't play it up or pile 
it on. Describe the specific behaviors and then move to solu­
tions. Although these discussions are never easy, they certainly 
don't have to be offensive or insulting. 
WORD GAMES 
'IYEAH, 
BUT. .. 
MY CHILDREN are constantly playing word games . If I 
try to tell them that they shouldn't have done some­
thing, they say I never told them exa ctly that. They' re 
starting to get on my ner ves. " 
The Danger Point 
Sometimes parents (and leaders) are tricked into accepting poor 
performance by silver-tongued individuals who are infinitely 
creative in coming up with new ways to explain why they didn't 
know any better. Not only do these inventive people have the 
ability to conjure up creative excuses, but they also have the 
energy and will to do so incessantly. Eventually they wear you 
down. As a result, they get away with doing less or doing it 21 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
poorly, while hard-working, energetic family members (or employ­
ees) end up carrying an unfair share of the load. 
The Solution 
This is another case of pattern over instance. Te ntatively ST AT E 
the pattern of splitting hairs and playing word games. Let them 
know they aren't fooling anyone. In this case, don't focus exclu­
sively on actions, because creative people can always find new 
inappropriate actions. "You didn't say I couldn't call her 'stu­
pid.''' Talk about both behaviors and outcome s. "You're hurting 
your sister's feelings when you call her stupid. Please don't do 
that, or anything else that might hurt her feelings." 
Use previous behavior as an example, and then hold them 
accountable to resu lts. Don't get pulled into discussing any one 
instance. Stick with the pattern. 
NO WARNING 
u YEA H, 
BUT... 
I' VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD people working fo r me, but 
they' re too full of sur prises. When they run into prob­
lems, I only find out after it's too late. They always 
have a good excuse, so what should I do?" 
The Danger Point 
Leaders who are constantly being surprised allow it to happen. 
The first time an employee says, "Sorry, but I ran into a prob­
lem," the leaders miss the point. They listen to the problem, 
work on it, and then move on to a new topic. In so doing, they 
are saying: "It's okay to surprise me. If you have a legitimate 
excuse, stop what you're doing, tum your efforts to something 
else, and then wait until I show up to spring the news." YEAH. BUT 21 3 
The So lution 
Make it perfectly clear that once you've given an assignment, 
there are only two acceptable paths. Employees need to complete 
the assignment as planned, or if they run into a problem, they 
need to immediately inform you. No surprises. Similarly, if they 
decide that another job needs to be done instead, they call you. 
No surprises. 
Clarif y the "no surprises" rule. The first time someone comes 
back with a legitimate excuse-but he or she didn't tell you 
when the problem first came up-deal with this as the new prob­
lem. "We agreed that you'd let me know immediat ely. I didn't get 
a call. What happened?" 
DEALI NG WITH SOMEONE WHO BREAKS ALL THE RULES 
"YEAH/ 
BUT. .. 
WHAT IF THE PERSON you 're dealing with viola tes all of 
the dialogue principles most of the time-especially 
during crucia l con versa tions. " 
The Danger Point 
When you look at a continuum of dialogue skills, most of us (by 
definition) fall in the middle. Sometime s we're on and some­
times we're off. Some of us are good at avoiding Sucker's 
Choices; others are good at making it safe. Of course, you have 
the extremes as well. You have people who are veritable conver­
sational geniuses. And now you're saying that you work with 
(maybe live with) someone who is the complete opposite. He or 
she rarely uses any skills. What's a person to do? 
The danger, of course, is that the other person isn't as bad as 
you think-you bring out the worst in him or her-or that he or 
she really is that bad . and you try to address all the problems at 
once. 214 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
The Solution 
Let's assume this person is pretty bad all of the time and with 
most everyone. Where do you start? Let's apply a metaphor here. 
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Choose your 
targets very carefully. Consider two dimensions: (1) What both­
ers you the most? "He or she is constantly assuming the worst 
and telling horrible stories." (2) What might be the easiest to 
work on? "He or she rarely shows any appreciation." 
Look for those areas that are most grievous to you and might 
not be all that hard to talk about. Pick one element and work on 
it. Establish Mutual Purpose. Frame the conversation in a way 
that the other person will care about. 
"I love it when we're feeling friendly toward each other. I'd 
like to have that feeling more frequently between us. There 
are a couple of things I'd like to talk about that I'm pretty 
convinced would help us with that. Can we talk?" 
STATE the issue, and then work on that one issue. Don't nag; 
don't take on everything at once. Deal with one element, one day 
at a time. 12

Change Your Life 
How to Turn Ideas into Habits 
One day you "overhear" yourself enthusias tically talking about a 
professional wrestling match. You're speaking with such gusto 
that you give yourself the willies. You think to yourself: "You 
know what? It's time to expand my cultural horizons." So you 
vow to read more widely and to watch three programs on the sci­
ence channel for every episode of reality TV. 
While you're at it, you commit to trimming down a bit as well. 
A reasonable diet and moderate exercise program couldn't hurt. 
To top it all off, you note that you're nearly consumed with your 
work, so you swear to spend more time with your family. 
More culture, better health, a stronger family-certainly you'll 
quickly transform such worthy desires into daily habits. 
Hardly. Changes of this sort are rarely easy. When it comes to 
turning out· wisp y hopl!s into concrete realities, our success rate 216 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
is mixed at best. This being the case, what are our chances of 
improving something as deeply rooted in our psyches as the way 
we comm unicate? Actually, it depends. There are a lot of vari­
ables that affect our chances. Consider the following factors. 
SURPRISE 
You've been asked to conduct your first meeting. To avoid 
embarrassing yourself, you read a book where you learn all about 
agendas, pacing, and the like. When it's time to lead your first 
meeting, you arrive early, adjust the chairs, set the markers just 
so, and lay out an agenda for each participant. As participants 
arrive, you greet them cordially. Then you kick off the meeting 
with a rousing icebreaker and you're off and running. 
Implementing meeting skills is as easy as falling off a log. 
That's because meetings are evident. You know when you're in 
one. You're seated at a table along with a bunch of other people. 
How could you not know you're in a meeting? They're also pre­
dictable. You can plan for them. You even have time to go over 
underlined portions from the book. 
Crucial conversations, in contrast, are far less evident. You 
don't sit in a crucial conversations room. You don't pass around 
a picture of your Path to Action. Instead you get thrown into a 
heated discussion where you rarely think, "Oh yes, I'm in the 
middle of a crucial conversation. That means I need to think 
about all that stuff I read last week." 
Discussi ons are also less predictable. Nobody sends you an 
invitation stating: "Would you please engage me in a crucial con­
versation next week after the team meeting where you're going 
to make a policy that will miff me?" High-risk discussions don't 
come with notices and reminders. More often than not, they 
come as unwelcome surprises. CHANGE YOUR LIFE 21 7 
EMOTION 
Emotions don't help much either. And, of course, crucial con­
versations are defined by their emotional characteristics. Your 
ability to pull yourself out of the content of a discussion and to 
focus on the process is inversely proportional to your level of 
emotion. The more you care about what's happening, the less 
likely you are to think about how you're conducting yourself. 
It's almost unfair. The bigger the deal, the less likely you are 
to bring your newly acquired skill-set into the conversation. Like 
it or not, if your adrenaline is flowing, you're almost guaranteed 
to jump to your Style Under Stress. 
Between surprise and emotion, it's hard to know which is the 
bigger enemy of change. Both make it hard to remember to act 
in new ways. 
SCRIPTS 
Now let's look at still another enemy of change-scripts. Scripts 
are pre bundled phrases we use in common conversations; they 
form the very foundation of social habits and often make change 
almost impossible. Consider the following. 
When we learn to speak, first come words, then phrases, and 
then scripts. The larger the bundles of words we carry around, the 
less we have to worry about combining them into sensible expres­
sions. Also the less we have to fret over syntax or grammar -that 
work has already been done for us. 
Unfortunately, predetermined expressions also put us into a 
sort of mental autopilot. Consider what happens when you walk 
into a fast-food restaurant. Do you think about the words you'll 
choose? Probably not. That's because when you enter familiar 
circumstances, you're carrying not only words and phrases, but 
an en tire scrip t in your head. 218 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
With a script, you know both sides of the conversation. You 
know that the person at the counter is going to ask for your 
order. You're certain that the perky young woman with the paper 
hat is going to ask you if you want fries. Even if you include fries 
in your original request, she's still going to ask, "Do you want 
fries with that?" And if you say yes, you can bet the farm that 
she's going to ask, "Do you want to super-size that?" 
The good news about packing around scripts is that you don't 
have to give conversation much thought. The bad news is that 
the more scripted an interaction, the more difficult it is to pull 
yourself out of the routine and try something new. For example, 
as you walk up to a fast-food counter, your spouse reminds you 
to ask for extra ketchup. 
You step up to the counter and say: "I'll have two house spe­
cials, three kiddy delights ... " and then you slip into autopilot. 
The words that pour out of your mouth have no relation to your 
thoughts. Your brain is somewhere else entirely. You're musing 
over a menu that sports a sandwich made out of "ribs" that have 
no bones. "What poor animal has boneless ribs ?" you're think­
ing to yourself. 
And gue ss what? As you robotically state your order, one 
word spilling out after another, you forget to ask for extra 
ketchup. What do you expect from a person who's devoting no 
real brain time to the interaction? In fact, your spouse's request 
never even makes it onto your radar screen-which is currently 
filled with images of Jell-O-like, ribless creatures mooing and 
slithering across a backdrop painted by Salvador Dali. 
Scripts place us on a smooth and familiar track. They take us 
across known territory and at a comfortable pace-freeing our 
brains for more novel work. But then again, when we're on rails, 
we travel along the prescribed route with such finesse and ease 
that it's almost impossible to make an unscheduled turn. CHANGE YOUR LIFE 219 
WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES? 
So let's see what we're facing when we try to change our Style 
Under Stress. To ugh conversations come at us out of nowhere, 
fill us with adrenaline, and evoke comfortable (but not neces­
sarily good) routines. They are spontaneous, emotional, and 
backed by years of practice. 
Consequently, when you examine people working through 
crucial conversations, they look a lot more like racehorses charg­
ing out of the gate than human beings making choices. Conver­
sationalists are shocked into motion by surprise, whipped up to 
speed by high stakes and strong emotions, and propelled along a 
completely predictable course by scripts that offer few if any 
options. 
TRANSFER TIPS 
Given the challenges of altering routine scripts, can people 
actually change? Early in our research, we (the authors) once 
examined forty-eight front-line supervisors who were learning 
how to hold crucial conversations . As we watched the trainees 
back at work, it became clear to us that only a few of them 
transferred what they had learned in the classroom back to 
their work site. The bad news is that most of them didn't 
change an iota. The good news is that some of them did. In 
fact, they used the new skills precisely as instructed. 
The supervisors who found a way to apply the new skills 
taught us the following four principles for turning ideas into 
action: 
• First, mast er the content. That means not only do you have 
to be able to recognize what works and why, but you have to 
generate new scripts of your own. 220 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
• Second, master the skills. You must be able to enact these new 
scripts in a way that is consistent with the supporting princi­
ples. As it turns out, simply understanding a concept isn't 
enough. While it's helpful, even necessary to talk the talk, you 
have to be able to walk the talk. You have to be able to say the 
right words with the right tone and nonverbal actions. When 
it comes to social skills, knowing and doing are two different 
animals. 
• Third, enhance your motive. You must want to change. This 
means that you have to care enough about improving your 
crucial conversation skills to actually do something. You have 
to move from a passive sense that it would be a good idea to 
change, to an active desire to seek opportunities . Ability with­
out motive lies dormant and untapped. 
• Fourth, watch for cues. To overcome surprise, emotion, and 
scripts, you must recognize the call to action. This is usually 
people's biggest obstacle to change. Old stimuli generate old 
responses. If a problem doesn't cue your new skills, you'll return 
to your old habits without even realizing you missed a chance to 
try something new. 
Master the Content 
There's too much material in this book to try to master in one sit­
ting. Despite the fact that you may have read this book rather 
quickly, a rapid once-over rarely generates much of a change in 
behavior. You may have a feel for the content, but probably not 
enough to propel you to change. 
Here are some other steps you can take to help master the 
content. CHANGE YOUR LIFE 221 
Do something. Years ago, Dale Carnegie recommended that 
you read his now classic How to Win Friends and Influence 
People one chapter at a time. Then, once you finished the chap­
ter, he suggested you go out and practice what you learned from 
it. We agree. Pick a chapter you found relevant (possibly one 
with a low score in your Style Under Stress test) and read it 
again. This time, implement what you learned over a three-to 
five-day period. Look for opportunities. Pounce on every chance 
you get. Step up to the plate and give the skills a try. Then pick 
another chapter and repeat the process. 
Discuss the mat erial. When you first learn something, your 
knowledge is "preverbal." That is, you might recognize the con­
cepts if you see them, but you're not able to discuss them with 
ease. You haven't talked about them enough to make them part 
of your functional vocabulary. You haven't turned the words 
into phrases and the phrases into scripts. To move your knowl­
edge to the next level, read a chapter and then discuss it with a 
friend or loved one. Ta lk about the material until the concepts 
come naturally. 
Teach the mat erial. If you really want to master a concept, 
teach it to someone else. Stick with it until the other person 
understands the concept well enough to pass it on to someone 
else. 
Master the Skills 
There 's a story going around the self-help talk circuit about a 
Vi etnam War prisoner who played golf in his head in order to 
help maintain his sanity. He'd mentally step up to each hole at 
his favorite golf course and "play" an entire round. After being 
released, he eventually found his way to the course, where he 
promptly shot his best score ever, one under par. When his 
frien ds acted asto nishe d at his new-found talent, he explained, 222 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
"Why shouldn't I have shot under par? I never once shot over 
par while I was in prison." 
This tale is routinely used to teach the power of mental prepa­
ration. Gurus can't say enough about the power of the mental 
game . While we agree that thinking is an essential part of the 
process, we'd like to emphasize the greater importance of doing. 
Evidence suggests that mental preparation can make some dif­
ference in execution, but thinking isn't enough. If you really want 
to improve your ability, practice. Step up to problems and give 
the material a try. 
Rehearse with a friend. Start by rehearsing with a friend. Ask 
a colleague or coworker to partner with you. Explain that you'd 
like to practice the skills you're learning. Briefly discuss the skill 
you'll be attempting. Provide the details of a real problem you're 
facing. (D on't include names or otherwise violate privacy 
issues.) Next, ask your friend to play the role of the other person 
and practice the crucial conversation. 
Ask your partner to give you honest feedback. Otherwise you 
could be practicing the wrong delivery. Remember, practice 
doesn't make perf ect; perfect practice makes perfect. Insist that 
your practice partner hold you to a high standard. Make sure 
you're constantly improving . 
Practice on the fly. You're going to be holding crucial conver­
sations at home and at work, or you wouldn't have bought this 
book in the first place. So practice the skills you've been read­
ing, teaching, and rehearsing. If you have children, hardly a day 
will pass that you won't have a chance to practice. 
Start immediat ely. If you wait until you're perfect before you 
give something a try, you could be waiting a long time. To make 
it safe, pick a conversation of only medium risk. Tr ying out 
something new is hard enough without applying it to a monu­
mental problem. CHANGE YOUR LIFE 223 
Practice in a training session. For those of you who would like 
more material and practice opportunities than you can extract 
from a book and other static materials, attend one of our live 
training seminars. Give us a call and see if you can either sched­
ule a session at a location near you or bring the training into your 
company. 
Our training materials library is equipped with a variety of 
delivery tools ranging from leader-guided workshops to off-site 
intensive courses. 
Enha nce Your Motive 
We all have ideas about how to motivate others, but how do you 
motivate yourself? While you may feel 100 percent comm itted to 
improving your crucial conversations right now, what can you do 
when you're staring at an angry coworker and your commi tment 
to improVIDent drops to, say, 10 percent? 
The truth is that we often need to take steps to ensure that our 
most well-founded wishes (those made during peaceful moments 
where we're taking an honest look at the future) survive turbu­
lent, less forward-looking circumstances. 
Apply incen tives. Start with the obvious. Use incentives. For 
example, people going through self-help courses are often 
encouraged to put their money where their mouth is. Every time 
they fulfill an assignment, they're given back a portion of their 
tuition. On the other hand, if they don't step up, it costs them. 
When incentives are added, results improve fairly dramatically. 
So every time you deftly hold a crucial conversation, celebrate 
your victory. Tr eat yourself to something you wouldn't otherwise 
enjoy. And don't wait for perfection. Celebrate improvement. If 
you used to get in a heated argument every time you brought up 
a cel-tain problem. and now the interaction is merely tense, enjoy 224 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
the victory. Self-improvement is achieved by individuals who 
appreciate direction more than those who demand perfection. 
Apply disincentives. You might consider disincentives as well. 
Ta ke a look at what went on at Stanford a few years back. 
Subjects who were trying to lose weight were asked to write a 
donation check to an organization they despised. These checks 
were then set aside, never to be mailed unless the subjects failed 
to live up to their goals-at which point five hundred dollars 
was sent to Americans for Nuclear Proliferation or something 
equally distas teful to the subject. As predicted, subjects did bet­
ter when they used disincentives.l 
Go pUbl ic. Let others know that you're trying to routinely 
hold crucial conversations. Explain what you're doing and why. 
Over half a century ago, Dr. Kurt Lewin, the father of social psy­
chology, learned that when subjects made a public commitment 
to do something, they were more likely to stay the course than if 
they kept their wishes to themselves.2 Te ll people what your 
goals are. Get social pressure working in your favor. 
Talk with your boss. If you want to take it a step further, sit 
down with your boss and explain your goals. Ask for his or her 
support. If you want to put some real teeth into your goal, build 
your plan into your performance review. As a leader, you're almost 
always asked to pick one "soft area" listed on your performance 
review forms and work on it. Select dialogue. You might as well 
tie your plans for improvement into the formal reward system. 
Align your personal, family, and organizational goals to a single 
goal-improving your dialogue skills. 
Remember the costs; focus on the reward. Perhaps the most 
predictive piece of social science research ever conducted was 
completed with small children and marshmallows. A child was 
put in a room and then told that he or she could have either one 
marshmallow now or two if he or she was willing to wait until 
the adult returned in a few minutes. The adult would then place CHANGE YOUR LIFE 225 
one marshmallow in front of the child and exit. Some of the chil­
dren delayed gratification. Others ate the marshmallow right 
away. Researchers continued studying these children. 
Over the next several decades, the children who had delayed 
gratification ended up doing far better in life than those who 
hadn't. They had stronger marriages, made more money, and 
were healthier.3 This willingness to do without now in order to 
achieve more later turns out to be an all-purpose tool for success. 
How did the children who were able to delay gratification 
fight off their short-term wishes? First, they looked away from 
the scrumptious marshmallow that sat in front of them. No use 
torturing themselves with the vision of what they couldn't have. 
Second, they kept telling themselves that if they waited, they 
would get two, not one. What could be simpler? 
As you step up to a crucial conversation and wonder if it's 
really worth trying out something new and untested, remind 
yourself why you're trying new skills in the first place. Focus on 
improved results. Remember what happens when you fall back 
on your old methods. 
Think "thing s." How can things help motivate you? Actually, 
this particular concept isn't easy to grasp. An example might 
help. You're unsuccessfully trying to lose weight. It turns out 
that your early-morning iron will turns into midday rubber as 
your stomach begins to growl and you sniff the air of the restau­
rant you frequent for lunch. What can you do with things to help 
keep you on track? 
Pack a sensible lunch first thing in the morning when your will 
is strong. Ta ke no money with you. That way it won't be easy to 
cave in to your weaker, afternoon wishes. By structuring around 
your self-control cycles, you heighten the power of your stronger 
motives while lessening the blow of you weaker mome nts. 
Schedule crucial conversations when you're feeling confident. 
Practice befurehHnd. Ta ke nutes. Set up your office the way you 226 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
would like. Anned with smart timing and material support, 
you're far more likely to step up to tough problems effectively. 
Build in Cues 
To remind yourself to use your new skills, create helpful cues. 
Mark hot spots. People who go through stress-reduction train­
ing learn to mark physical items that are closely linked to their 
sources of tension. People who freak out in traffic put a small red 
circle on their steering wheel. Individuals who are constantly in 
a rush put one on their watch. 
When it comes to the tough conversations you face, you might 
want to make use of small visual cues as well. Place one on the 
computer that spits out results that drive you nuts. Build a cue 
into your copy of the agenda of any meeting that typically serves 
up tough problems. 
Set aside a time. Perhaps the best way to remind yourself to 
use your new skills is to set aside a time each day to walk around 
in search of both successes and problems. When you see a suc­
cess, celebrate. When you encounter a problem, bring your best 
dialogue tools into play. 
Read reactions. If you're not doing a good job of holding cru­
cial conversations, the results are going to be right in front of 
you. If you see that you're getting off track, back up and start 
over. Use real-life cues (e.g., the other person's jaw tenses, he or 
she clams up, etc.) to remind yourself that maybe it's time to try 
a new tactic. If necessary, apologize. Move to an earlier place in 
the discussion and follow the process. 
Build in permanent reminders. Order a poster of the model, 
place it on the wall, and look at it each morning as you start the day. 
Carry a reminder. Along with the poster, order a set of cue 
cards you can tuck into your purse or shirt pocket. CHANGE YOUR LIFE 227 
A DIG ITAL ASSIST 
We've tried to include in this book everything you'll need to con­
duct crucial conversations. Our goal was to provide a complete, 
stand-alone tool for personal change. Nevertheless, when it 
comes to improving social interactions, the digital domain has a 
lot to offer as well. Audio, video, and other digital tools can 
enhance your learning experience. 
As an additional resource, we invite you to our website. There 
you'll find a variety of tools for helping you transform the printed 
word into daily actions. Digital tools include conceptual, behav­
ioral, and cuing tools. 
Conceptual Tools 
Watch. To give you live-action views of the skills we cover, we've 
added video examples to our website. Vi sit us at www .crucial­
conversations .com and check out video clips for specific skills. 
Listen . Many people enjoy listening to audiotapes or CDs as 
they commute to and from work each day. We've put together an 
audio mas tery course that not only reviews the material chapter 
by chapter, but also provides audio examples of what the skills 
sound like when put into action. Move your knowledge from the 
abstract to the concrete as you hear how the theories translate 
into words and the words build into usable scripts. 
Behavioral Tools 
If you'd like to practice specific skills with the aid of a role-play 
tool, go to our website and check out Free Resources to down­
load role-play rehearsals. Print out the role plays and then work 
with a partner until you've mastered the skill. 228 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 
Cuing Tools 
Vi sit www .crucia1conversations.com to sign up for regular tips,

tunities to use your crucial conversations skills. 
A PARTING THOUGH T 
We'll be forever indebted to the wonderful people who allowed 
us to roll up our sleeves, work side by side with them, and study 
their best practices. We're particularly grateful to individuals 
who allowed us to watch them as they struggled to work through 
crucial conversations . It's hard enough to sort out facts, stories, 
and feelings without being scrutinized under a micro scope while 
you're doing it. 
We hope that by sharing the theories, skills, and models we've 
learned from these dear friends and colleagues, we'll help you 
feel more comfortable stepping up to your own crucial conver­
sations. You'll be able to add to the pool of available meaning, 
make better decisions, and work in a way that both gets the job 
done and enhances your relationships. 
So we encourage you to pick a relationship. Pick a conversa­
tion. Let others know that you're trying to do better, then give 
it a shot. When you blow it, admit it. Don't expect perfection; 
aim for progress. And when you succeed, celebrate your suc­
cess. We hope you'll take pleasure in knowing that you're 
improving and so are your relationships. Finally, when the 
chance arises, help others do the same. Help friends, loved 
ones, and coworkers learn to master their own high-stakes dis­
cussions. Help strengthen organizations, solidify families, heal 
comm unities, and shore up nations one person-one crucial 
conversation-at a time. Endnotes
