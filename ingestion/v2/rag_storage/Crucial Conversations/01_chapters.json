    "raw_text": "Foreword \nThis is a breakthrough book. That is exactly how I saw it when \nI first read the manuscript. I so resonated with the importance, \npower, and timeliness of its message that I even suggested to the \nauthors that they title it \"Break through Conversati ons .\" But as I \nread deeper, listened to the tapes, and experienced the insight \nborne of years of experience with this material, I came to under­\nstand why it is titled Crucial Conversations. \nFrom my own work with organizations, including families, \nand from my own experience, I have come to see that there are \na few defining moments in our lives and careers that make all \nthe difference. Many of these defining moments come from \n\"crucial\" or \"breakthrough\" conver sations with important peo­\nple in emotionally charged situations where the decisions made \ntake us down one of several roads, each of which leads to an \nentirely different destination. \nI can see the wisdom in the assertion of the great historian \nArnold Toynbee, who said that you can pretty well summarize all \nof history-not only of society, but of institutions and of people­\nin four words: Nothing fails like success. In other words, when \na challenge in life is met by a response that is equal to it, you \nhave success. But when the challenge moves to a higher level, \nthe old, once successful response no longer works-it fails; \nthus, nothing fails like success."

    "raw_text": "XII FOREWORD \nThe challenge has noticeably changed for our lives, our fami­\nlies, and our organization s. Just as the world is changing at \nfrightening speed and has become increasingly and profoundly \ninterdependent with marvelous and dangerous technologies, so, \ntoo, have the stresses and pressures we all experience exponen­\ntially increased. This charged atmosphere makes it all the more \nimperative that we nourish our relationships and develop tools, \nskills, and enhanced capacity to find new and better solutions to \nour problems. \nThese newer, better solutions will not represent \"my way\" or \n\"your way\"-they will represent \"our way.\" In short, the solu­\ntions must be synergistic, meaning that the whole is greater than \nthe sum of the parts. Such synergy may manifest itself in a bet­\nter decision, a better relationship , a better decision-making \nprocess, increased commitment to implement decisions made, \nor a combination of two or more of these. \nWhat you learn is that \"crucial conve rsations\" transform peo­\nple and relationships. They are anything but transacted; they \ncreate an entirely new level of bonding. They produce what \nBuddhism calls \"the middle way\" -not a compromise between \ntwo opposites on a straight-line continuum, but a higher middle \nway, like the apex of a triangle. Because two or more people \nhave created something new from genuine dialogue, bonding \ntakes place-just like the bonding that takes place in family or \nmarriage when a new child is created. When you produce some­\nthing with another person that is truly creative, it's one of the \nmost powerful forms of bonding there is. In fact the bonding is \nso strong that you simply would not be disloyal in his or her \nabsence, even if there were social pressure to join others in bad­\nmouthing. \nThe sequential development of the subject matter in this book \nis brilliant. It moves you from understanding the supernal power\n\f\nFOREWORD XIII \nof dialogue, to clarifying what you really want to have happen and \nfocusing on what actually is happening, to creating conditions of \nsafety, to using self-awareness and self-knowledge. And finally, it \nmoves you to learning how to achieve such a level of mutual \nunderstanding and creative synergy that people are emotionally \nconnected to the conclusions reached and are emotionally willing \nand committed to effectively implementing them. In short, you \nmove from creating the right mind- and heart-set to developing \nand utilizing the right skill-set. \nIn spite of the fact that I have spent many years writing and \nteaching similar ideas, I found myself being deeply influenced, \nmotivated, and even inspired by this material-learning new ideas, \ngoing deeper into old ideas, seeing new applications, and broaden­\ning my understanding. I've also learned how these new techniques, \nskills, and tools work together in enabling crucial conversations \nthat truly create a break with the mediocrity or mistakes of the \npast. Most breakthroughs in life truly are \"break-withs.\" \nWhen I first put my hands on this book, I was delighted to see \nthat dear friends and colleagues had drawn on their entire lives \nand professional experiences to not only address a tremendously \nimportant topic, but also to do it in a way that is so accessible, so \nfun, so full of humor and illustration, so full of common sense \nand practicality. They show how to effectively blend and use both \nintellectual (1.0.) and emotional intelligence (E.O.) to enable \ncrucial conversatio ns. \nI remember one of the authors having a crucial convers ation \nwith his professor in college. The professor felt that this student \nwas neither paying the price in class nor living up to his potential. \nThis student, my friend, listened carefully, restated the professor's \nconcern, expressed appreciation for the professor's affirmation of \nhis potentia l , and then smilingly and calmly said, \"My focus is on"

I hope you can understand .\" The teacher was taken \naback, but then started to listen. A dialogue took place, new \nunderstanding was achieved, and the bonding was deepened. \nI know these authors to be outstanding individuals and \nremarkable teachers and consultants, and have even seen them \nwork their magic in training seminars-but I didn't know if they \ncould take this complex topic and fit it into a book. They did. I \nencourage you to really dig into this material, to pause and think \ndeeply about each part and how the parts are sequenced. Then \napply what you've learned, go back to the book again, learn \nsome more, and apply your new learnin gs. Remember, to know \nand not to do is really not to know. \nI think you'll discover, as have I, that crucial conversatio ns, as \npowerfully described in this book, reflect the insight of this \nexcerpt of Robert Frost's beaut iful and memorable poem, \"The \nRoad Not Taken\": \nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood, \nAnd sorry I could not travel both \nAnd be one traveler, long I stood \nAnd looked down one as far as I could \nTo where it bent in the undergrowth; ... \nI shall be telling this with a sigh \nSomewhere ages and ages hence: \nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I­\nI took the one less traveled by, \nAnd that has made all the difference. \n- Stephen R.

NORTHCOTE PARKINSON \nWhat's a Crucial \nConversation? \nAnd Who Cares? \nWhen people first hear the term \"crucial conversatio n,\" many \nconjure up images of presidents, emperors, and prime ministers \nseated around a massive table while they debate the future of the \nworld. Although it's true that such discussions have a wide­\nsweeping and lasting impact, they're not the kind we have in \nmind. The crucial conversations we're referring to in the title of \nthis book are interactions that happen to everyone. They're the \nday-to-day conver sations that affect your life. \nNow, what makes one of your conversations crucial as opposed \nto plain vani lla? First, opinions vary. For example, you're talking \nwith your boss about a possible promotion. She thinks you're \nnot ready; you think you are. Second, stakes are high. You're in\n\f\na meeting with four coworkers and you're trying to pick a new \nmarketing strategy. You've got to do something different or your \ncompany isn't going to hit its annual goals. Third, emotions run \nstrong. You're in the middle of a casual discussion with your \nspouse and he or she brings up an \"ugly incident\" that took place \nat yesterday's neighborhood block party. Apparently not only did \nyou flirt with someone at the party, but according to your spouse, \n\"You were practically making out.\" You don't remember flirting. \nYou simply remember being polite and friendly. Your spouse \nwalks off in a huff. \nAnd speaking of the block party, at one point you're making \nsmall talk with your somewhat crotchety and always colorful \nneighbor about his shrinking kidneys when he says, \"Spe aking of \nthe new fence you're building ... \" From that moment on you \nend up in a heated debate over placing the new fence-three \ninches one way or the other. Three inches ! He finishes by threat­\nening you with a lawsuit, and you punctuate your points by men­\ntioning that he's not completely aware of the difference between \nhis hind part and his elbow. Emotions run really strong. \nWhat makes each of these conversations crucial-and not sim­\nply challenging, frustrating, frightening, or annoying-is that the \nresults could have a huge impact on the quality of your life. In each \ncase, some element of your daily routine could be forever altered \nfor better or worse. Clearly a promotion could make a big differ­\nence. Your company's success affects you and everyone you work \nwith. Your relationship with your spouse influences every aspect of \nyour life. Even something as trivial as a debate over a property line \naffects how you get along with your neighbor. If you handle even a \nseemingly insignificant conversation poorly, you establish a pattern \nof behavior that shows up in all of your crucial conversations. \nBy definition, crucial conversations are about tough issues. \nUnf ortunately, it's human nature to back away from discussions \nwe fear will hurt us or make things worse. We're masters at avoid­\ning these tough convers ations. Coworkers send email to caI.:h\n\f\nother when they should walk down the hall and talk turkey. Bosses \nleave voice mail in lieu of meeting with their direct reports. Family \nmembers change the subject when an issue gets too risky. We (the \nauthors) have a friend who learned through a voice-mail message \nthat his wife was divorcing him. We use all kinds of tactics to \ndodge touchy issues. \nBut it doesn't have to be this way. If you know how to handle \n(even master) crucial conversations, you can step up to and effec­\ntively hold tough conversations about virtually any topic. \nCrucial Conversation (kroo shel kan'viir sa'shen) n \nA discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are \nhigh, (2) opinions vary, and (3) emotions run strong. \nHOW DO WE TYPICALLY HAN DLE CRUCIAL \nCONVE RSATIONS? \nJust because we're in the middle of a crucial conversation (or \nmaybe thinking about stepping up to one) doesn't mean that \nwe're in trouble or that we won't fare well. In truth, when we \nface crucial conver sations, we can do one of three things: \n• We can avoid them. \n• We can face them and handle them poorly. \n• We can face them and handle them well. \nThat seems simple enough. Walk away from crucial conv ersa­\ntions and suffer the consequences. Handle them poorly and suf­\nfer the consequences. Or handle them well. \n\"I don't know,\" you think to yourself. \"Given the three choic­\nes, I'll go with handling them well.\" \nWe're on Our Worst Behavior \nBut do we handle them w ell? When talking turns tough, do we \npause, takc a deep brcuth, unnl.>uncc to our innerselves, \"Uh-oh,\n\f\n4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthis discussion is crucial. I'd better pay close attention\" and then \ntrot out our best behavior? Or when we're anticipating a poten­\ntially dangerous discussion, do we step up to it rather than scam­\nper away? Sometimes. Sometimes we boldly step up to hot topics, \nmonitor our behavior, and offer up our best work. We mind our \nPs and Os. Sometimes we're just flat-out good. \nAnd then we have the rest of our lives. These are the moments \nwhen, for whatever reason, we either anticipate a crucial conver­\nsation or are in the middle of one and we're at our absolute \nworst-we yell; we withdraw; we say things we later regret. When \nconversations matter the most-that is, when conversations move \nfrom casual to crucial-we're generally on our worst behavior. \nWhy is that? \nWe're designed wrong. When conversations tum from routine \nto crucial, we're often in trouble. That's because emotions don't \nexactly prepare us to conver se effectively. Countless generations \nof genetic shaping drive humans to handle crucial conver sations \nwith flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent persuasion and gen­\ntle attentivene ss. \nFor instance, consider a typical crucial conversation. Someone \nsays something you disagree with about a topic that matters a \ngreat deal to you and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. \nThe hairs you can ha ndle. Unf ortunately, your body does more. \nTwo tiny organs seated neatly atop your kidneys pump adrenaline \ninto your bloodstream. You don't choose to do this. Your adrenal \nglands do it, and then you have to live with it. \nAnd that's not all. Your brain then diverts blood from activi­\nties it deems nonessential to high-priority tasks such as hitting \nand running. Unf ortunate ly, as the large muscles of the arms \nand legs get more blood, the higher-level reasoning sections of \nyour brain get less. As a result, you end up facing challenging \nconver sations with the same equipment available to a rhesus \nmonkey.\n\f\nWHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 5 \nWe're under pressure. Let's add another factor. Crucial con­\nversations are frequently spontaneous. More often than not, they \ncome out of nowhere. And since you're caught by surprise, \nyou're forced to conduct an extraordinarily complex human \ninteraction in real time-no books, no coaches, and certainly no \nshort breaks while a team of therapists runs to your aid and \npumps you full of nifty ideas. \nWhat do you have to work with? The issue at hand, the other \nperson, and a brain that's preparing to fight or take flight. It's lit­\ntle wonder that we often say and do things that make perfect sense \nin the moment, but later on seem, well, stupid. \n\"What was I thinking?\" you wonder. \nThe truth is, you were real-time multitasking with a brain that \nwas working another job. You're lucky you didn't suffer a stroke. \nWe're stumped. Now let's throw in one more complication. \nYou don't know where to start. You're making this up as you go \nalong because you haven't often seen real-life models of effec­\ntive communication skills. Let's say that you actually planned \nfor a tough conversation-maybe you've even mentally \nrehearsed. You feel prepared, and you're as cool as a cucumber. \nWill you succeed? Not necess arily. You can still screw up, \nbecause practice doesn't make perfect; perfect practice makes \nperfect. \nThis means that first you have to know what to practice. \nSometimes you don't. After all, you may have never actually seen \nhow a certain problem is best handled. You may have seen what \nnot to do-as modeled by a host of friends, colleagues, and, yes, \neven your parent s. In fact, you may have sworn time and again \nnot to act the same way. \nLeft with no healthy models, you're now more or less \nstumped. So what do you do? You do what most people do. You \nwing it. You piece together the words, create a certain mood, and \notherwise make up what you think will work-all the while"

    "raw_text": "6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nmultiprocessing with a half-starved brain. It's little wonder that \nwhen it matters the most, we're often at our worst behavior. \nWe act in self-defeating ways. In our doped-up, dumbed-down \nstate, the strategies we choose for dealing with our crucial con­\nversations are perfectly designed to keep us from what we actu­\nally want. We're our own worst enemies-a nd we don't even \nrealize it. Here's how this works. \nLet's say that your significant other has been paying less and \nless attention to you. You realize he or she has a busy job, but \nyou still would like more time together. You drop a few hints \nabout the issue, but your loved one doesn't handle it well. You \ndecide not to put on added pressure, so you clam up. Of course, \nsince you're not all that happy with the arrangement, your dis­\npleasure now comes out through an occasional sarcastic remark. \n\"Another late night, huh? Do you really need all of the \nmoney in the world?\" \nUnf ortunately (and here's where the problem becomes self­\ndefeating) , the more you snip and snap, the less your loved one \nwants to be around you. So your significant other spends even \nless time with you, you become even more upset, and the spi­\nral continue s. Your behavior is now actually creating the very \nthing you didn't want in the first place. You're caught in an \nunhealth y, self-defeating loop. \nOr consider what's happening with your roommate Terry­\nwho wears your and your other two roommates' clothes (without \nasking)-a nd he's proud of it. In fact, one day while walking out \nthe door, he glibly announced that he was wearing something \nfrom each of your closets. You could see Taylor's pants, Scott's \nshirt, and, yes, even Chris's new matching shoes-and-socks \nensemble. What of yours could he possibly be wearing? Eww! \nYour response, quite natur ally, has been to bad-mouth Terry \nbehind his back. That is until one day when he overheard you\n\f\nWHATS A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 7 \nbelittling him to a friend, and you're now so embarrassed that you \navoid being around him. Now when you're out of the apartment, \nhe wears your clothes, eats your food, and uses your computer \nout of spite. \nLet's try another example. You share a cubicle with a four-star \nslob and you're a bit of a neat freak. In Odd Couple parlance, \nyou're Felix and he's Oscar. Your coworker has left you notes \nwritten in grease pencil on your file cabinet, in catsup on the back \nof a french-fry bag, and in permanent marker on your desk blot­\nter. You, in contrast, leave him typed Post-it notes. Typed. \nAt first you sort of tolerated each other. Then you began to get \non each other's nerv es. You started nagging him about cleaning \nup. He started nagging you about your nagging. Now you're \nbeginning to react to each other. Every time you nag, he becomes \nupset, and, well, let's say that he doesn't exactly clean up. Every \ntime he calls you an \"anal-retentive nann y,\" you vow not to give \nin to his vile and filthy ways. \nWhat has come from all this bickering? Now you're neater \nthan ever, and your cubicle partner's half of the work area is \nabout to be condemned by the health department . You're caught \nin a self-defeating loop. The more the two of you push each \nother, the more you create the very behaviors you both despise. \nSome Comm on Crucial Conversati ons \nIn each of these examples of unhealthy self-perpetuation, the \nstakes were moderate to high, opinions varied, and emotions ran \nstrong. Actually, to be honest, in a couple of the examples the \nstakes were fairly low at first, but with time and growing emo­\ntions, the relationship eventually turned sour and quality of life \nsuffered-making the risks high. \nThese examples, of course, are merely the tip of an enormous \nand ugly iceberg of problems stemming from crucial conversations\n\f\n8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthat either have been avoided or have gone wrong. Other topics \nthat could easily lead to disaster include \n• Ending a relationship \n• Talking to a coworker who behaves offensively or makes sugges­\ntive comments \n• Asking a friend to repay a loan \n• Giving the boss feedback about her behavior \n• Approaching a boss who is breaking his own safety or quality \npolicies \n• Critiquing a colleague's work \n• Asking a roommate to move out \n• Resolving custody or visitation issues with an ex-spouse \n• Dealing with a rebellious teen \n• Talking to a team member who isn't keeping commitments \n• Discussi ng problems with sexual intimacy \n• Confronting a loved one about a subs tance abuse problem \n• Talking to a colleague who is hoarding infonnation or resources \n• Giving an unfavorab le performance review \n• Asking in-laws to quit interfering \n• Talking to a coworker about a personal hygiene problem \nOUR AUDACIOUS CLAIM \nLet's say that either you avoid tough issues or when you do bring \nthem up, you're on your worst behavior. What's the big deal? \nHow high are the stakes anyway? Do the consequences of a \nfouled-up conversation extend beyond the conversation itself? \nShould you worry?\n\f\nWHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 9 \nActually, the effects of conversations gone bad can be both \ndevastating and far reaching. Our research has shown that strong \nrelationships, careers, organizations, and communities all draw \nfrom the same source of power-the ability to talk openly about \nhigh-stakes, emotional, controversial topics. \nSo here's the audacious claim. Master your crucial conver sa­\ntions and you'll kick-start your career, strengthen your relation­\nships, and improve your health. As you and others master high­\nstakes discussions, you'll also vitalize your organization and your \ncommunity. \nKick-Start Your Career \nCould the ability to master crucial conversations help your career? \nAbsolutely. Twenty-five years of research with twenty thousand \npeople and hundreds of organizations has taught us that individu­\nals who are the most influential-who can get things done, and at \nthe same time build on relationships-a re those who master their \ncrucial conversations. \nFor instance, high performers know how to stand up to the \nboss without committing career suicide. We've all seen people \nhurt their careers over tough issues. You may have done it your­\nself. Fed up with a lengthy and unhealthy pattern of behavior, you \nfinally speak out-but a bit too abruptly. Oops. Or maybe an \nissue becomes so hot that as your peers twitch and fidget them­\nselves into a quivering mass of potential stroke victims, you \ndecide to say something. It's not a pretty discuss ion-but some­\nbody has to have the guts to keep the boss from doing something \nstupid. (Gulp .) \nAs it turns out, you don't have to choose between being hon­\nest and being effective. You don't have to choose between candor \nand your career. People who routinely hold crucial conversations \nand hold them well are able to express controversial and even\n\f\n10 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nrisky opinions in a way that gets heard. Their bosses, peers, and \ndirect reports listen without becoming defensive or angry. \nWhat about your career? Are there crucial conver sations that \nyou're not holding or not holding well? Is this undermining your \ninfluence? And more important ly, would your career take a step \nforward if you could improve how you're dealing with these \nconversations? \nImpr ove Your Organization \nOkay, so individu al careers may sink or swim based on crucial \nconver sations, but how about organizations? Surely a soft-and­\ngushy factor such as how you talk to one another doesn't have an \nimpact on the not so soft-and-gushy bottom line. \nFor twenty-five years we (the authors) explored this very issue. \nWe (and hundreds of others) searched for keys to organizational \nsuccess. Most of us studying the elusive topic figured that some­\nthing as large as a company's overall success would depend on \nsomething as large as a company's strategy, structure, or systems. \nAfter all, organizations that maintain best-in-class productivity \nrely on elegant performance-management systems. Widespread \nproductivity couldn't result from anything less, could it? We \nweren't alone in our thinking. Every organization that attempted \nto bring about improvements-at least the companies we had \nheard of-began by revamping their performance-management \nsystems. \nThen we actually studied those who had invested heavily in \nspiffy new performance-management systems. It turns out that \nwe were dead wrong. Changing structures and systems alone did \nlittle to improve performance. For example, one study of five \nhundred stunningly productive organizations revealed that peak \nperformance had absolutely nothing to do with forms, pro­\ncedures, and policies that drive performance management. In\n\f\nWHAT'S A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 11 \nfact, half of the highflyers had almost no formal performance­\nmanagement processes.! \nWhat's behind their success? It all comes down to how people \nhandle crucial conve rsations. Within high-performing com­\npanies, when employees fail to deliver on their promises, col­\nleagues willingly and effectively step in to discuss the problem. \nIn the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and \nthen transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with \nproblems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else \naccountable-regardless of level or position. The path to high \nproductivity passes not through a static system, but through \nface-to-face conversations at all levels. \nSolve pressing problems. The best companies in almost any \ncritical area are the ones that have developed the skills for deal­\ning effectively with conver sations that relate to that specific \ntopic. For example: \n• Safety. When someone violates a procedure or otherwise acts \nin an unsafe way, the first person to see the problem, regard­\nless of his or her position, steps up and holds a crucial con­\nversation. \n• Productivity. If an employee underperforms, fails to live up to \na promise, doesn't carry his or her fair share, or simply isn't \nproductive enough, the affected parties address the problem \nimmediately. \n• Diversity. When someone feels offended, threatened, insulted, \nor harassed, he or she skillfully and comfortably, discusses the \nissue with the offending party. \n• Quality. In companies where quality rules, people discuss \nproblems face-to-face when they first come up. \n• Ellery other hot topic. Companies that are best-in-class in inno­\nvation. teamwork, change man agement, or any other area that\n\f\n12 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \ncalls for human interaction are best-in-class in holding the rel­\nevant crucial conversations. \nWhat's the relationship between success in a key area and crucial \nconversations? Companies that make impressive improvements \nin key performance areas (and eventually master them) are gen­\nerally no different than others in their efforts to improve . They \nconduct the same awareness training, print the same banne rs, \nand make the same speeches. They differ in what happens when \nsomeone does something wrong. Rather than waiting for a poli­\ncy to kick in or a leader to take charge, people step up, speak up, \nand thrive. Equally important, if it's a leader who seems to be out \nof line, employees willingly speak up, the problem is solved, and \nthe company moves on. \nSo what about you? Is your organization stuck in its progress \ntoward some important goal? If so, are there conversations that \nyou're either avoiding or botching? And how about the people \nyou work with? Are they stepping up to or walking away from \ncrucial conver sations? Could you take a big step forward by \nimproving how you deal with these conversations? \nImp rove Your Relationship s \nConsider the impact crucial conve rsations can have on your \nrelationship s. Could failed crucial conver sations lead to failed \nrelationshi ps? As it turns out, when you ask the average person \nwhat causes couples to break up, he or she usually suggests that \nit's due to differences of opinion. You know, people have differ­\nent theories about how to manage their finan ces, spice up their \nlove lives, or rear their children. In truth, everyone argues about \nimportant issues. But not everyone splits up. It's how you argue \nthat matters. \nFor example, when Clifford Notarius and Howard Markman \n(two noted marriage scholars) examined couples in the throes of\n\f\nWHAfS A CRUCIAL CONVERSATION? 13 \nheated discussions, they learned that people fall into three cate­\ngories-those who digress into threats and name-calling, those \nwho revert to silent fuming, and those who speak openly, hon­\nestly, and effectively. \nMter watching dozens of couples, the two scholars predicted \nrelationship outcomes and tracked their research subjects' rela­\ntionships for the next ten years. Sure enough, they had predicted \nnearly 90 percent of the divorces that occurred.2 Over time, cou­\nples who found a way to state their opinions about high-stakes, \ncontroversial, and emotional issues honestly and respectfully \nremained together. Those who didn't, split up. \nNow, what about you? Think of your own important relation­\nships. Are there a few crucial conversations that you're current­\nly avoiding or handling poorly? Do you walk away from some \nissues only to come charging back into others? Do you hold in \nugly opinions only to have them tumble out as sarcastic remarks \nor cheap shots? How about your significant other or family \nmembers? Are they constantly toggling from seething silence to \nsubtle but costly attacks? When it matters the most (after all, \nthese are your cherished loved ones), are you on your worst \nbehavior? If so, you definitely have something to gain by learn­\ning more about how to handle crucial conversations. \nRevita lize Your Commun ity \nNext, let's look at our neighborhoods and communities. If the fate \nof an organization is largely determined by how pivotal conver­\nsations are habitually handled, why should the communities that \nsurround them be any different? The truth is, they aren't. \nThe difference between the best communi ties and the good or \nthe worst is not the number of problems they have. All commu­\nnities face problems. Once again, the difference lies in how they \ndeal with problems. In the best communities, key indiv iduals\n\f\n14 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nand groups find a way to engage in healthy dialogue. They talk \nthrough important issues. In contr ast, communities that fail to \nimprove play costly games. During community meetings peo­\nple insult one another, become indignant, and act as if indi­\nviduals with differing views are sick or deranged. Battles \nensue. \nIn addition to how people behave in public forums, private \nbehavior affects community health as well. Take, for example, \nthe problem of crime. You might be shocked to discover a rather \ntragic statistic. Not everyone in prison is a career criminal who \nwas born into a horrible family, then shaped by abuse and neg­\nlect into a seething sociopath. In fact, over half of the people \nwho are convicted of violent crimes are first-time offenders who \ncommit crimes against friends or loved ones. 3 \nHow could this be? Violence is often preceded by prolonged \nperiods of silence. Most inmates once held a job, paid their \nbills, and remembered their friends' birthdays. Then one day , \nafter allowing unresolved problems to build up and then boil \nover, they attacked a friend, loved one, or neighbor. That's \nright, convicted first-time offenders are often not career crimi­\nnals . They're our frustrated neighbors. Since they don't know \nwhat to say or how to say it, they opt for force. In this case, the \ninability to work through tough issues devastates individ uals, \nruins families, and poisons communities. \nWhat about where you live? What crucial issues does your \ncommunity face? Are there conversations that people are not \nholding or not holding well that keep you from progress? Is \ncrime skyrocketing? Do your community meetings look more \nlike the Jerry Springer show than an energetic forum for \nhealthy communication? If so, both you and the community \nhave a lot to gain by focusing on how you handle high-stakes \ndiscussions."

It could \nkill you?\" \nThe short answer is yes . The longer answer suggests that the \nnegative feelings we hold in, the emotional pain we suffer, and \nthe constant battering we endure as we stumble our way through \nunhealthy conversations slowly eat away at our health. In some \ncases the impact of failed conv ersations leads to minor problems. \nIn others it results in disas ter.

In fact, we started our research into orga­\nnizational and personal excellence by studying a slightly different \ntopic. We figured that if we could learn why certain people were \nmore effective than others, then we could learn exactly what they \ndid, clone it, and pass it on to others. \nTo find the source of success, we started at work. We asked \npeople to identify who they thought were their most effective\n\f\n18 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \ncolleagues. In fact, over the past twenty-five years, we've asked \nover twenty thousand people to identify the individuals in their \norganizations who could really get things done. We wanted to \nfind those who were not just influential, but who were far more \ninfluential than the rest. \nEach time, as we compiled the names into a list, a pattern \nemerged. Some people were named by one or two colleagues. \nSome found their way onto the lists of five or six people. These \nwere the good at influenc e, but not good enough to be widely \nidentified as top performers. And then there were the handful \nwho were named thirty or more times. These were the best-the \nclear opinion leaders in their areas. Some were managers and \nsupervisors. Many were not. \nOne of the opinion leaders we became particularly interested \nin meeting was named Kevin. He was the only one of eight vice \npresidents in his company to be identified as exceedingly influ­\nential. We wanted to know why. So we watched him at work. \nAt first, Kevin didn't do anything remarkable. In truth, he looked \nlike every other VP. He answered his phone, talked to his direct \nreports, and continued about his pleasant, but routine, routine. \nThe Startl ing Discovery \nAfter trailing Kevin for almost a week, we began to wonder if he \nreally did act in ways that set him apart from others or if his \ninfluence was simply a matter of popularity. And then we fol­\nlowed Kevin into a meeting. \nKevin, his peers, and their boss were deciding on a new loca­\ntion for their offices-would they move across town, across the \nstate, or across the country? The first two execs presented their \narguments for their top choices, and as expected, their points were \ngreeted by penetrating questions from the full team. No vague \nclaim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquesti oned."

However, when peo­\nple tried to disagree or push back on Chris, he responded poorly. \nSince he was the big boss, he didn't exactly have to browbeat \npeople to get what he wanted. Instead, he became slightly defen­\nsive. First he raised an eyebrow. Then he raised his finger. Finally \nhe raised his voice-j ust a little. It wasn't long until people \nstopped questioning him, and Chris's inadequate proposal was \nquietly accepted. \nWell almost. That's when Kevin spoke up. His words were \nsimple enough-so mething like, \"Hey Chris, can I check some­\nthing out with you?\" \nThe reaction was stunning-everyone in the room stopped \nbreathing. But Kevin ignored the apparent terror of his col­\nleagues and plunged on ahead. In the next few minutes he in \nessence told the CEO that he appeared to be violating his own \ndecision-making guidelines. He was subtly using his power to \nmove the new offices to his hometown. \nKevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when \nhe finished the first crucial minutes of this delicate exchange, \nChris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. \"You're \nabsolutely right,\" he finally concluded. \"I have been trying to \nforce my opinion on you. Let's back up and try again.\" \nThis was a crucial conversation, and Kevin played no games \nwhatsoever. He didn't resort to silence like his colleagues, nor \ndid he try to force his argument s on others. As a result, the team \nchose a far more reasonable location and Kevin's boss appreci­\nated his candor. \nWhen Kevin was done, one of his peers turned to us and said, \n\"Did you see how he did that? If you want to know how he gets \nthings done, figure out what he just did.\" \nSo we did. In fact, we spent the next twenty-five years discov­\nering what Kevin and people like him do. What typically set\n\f\n20 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthem apart from the rest of the pack was their ability to deal with \ncrucial conve rsations. When talking turned tough and stakes \nwere high, they excelled. But how? Kevin wasn't that different. \nHe did step up to a tough issue and help the team make a better \nchoice, but what exactly did he do? Did he possess learnable \nskills, or was what he did more magical than manag eable? \nTo answer these questions, first, let's explore what Kevin was \nable to achieve. This will help us see where we're trying to go. Then \nwe'll examine the dialogue tools effective communicators routinely \nuse and learn to apply them to our own crucial conversations. \nTHE \"ONE THING\" \nIf you've seen the movie City Slickers, you may remember a scene \nwhere the crusty character Curly explains that if you want to suc­\nceed in life you have to do one thing. Then, in typical Hollywood \nfashion, he explains that he's not about to tell you what that one \nthing is. You have to figure it out yourself. \nWe won't pull a Curly. We'll reveal the one thing. When it \ncomes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled \npeople find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves \nand others) out into the open. \nThat's it. At the core of every successful conversation lies the \nfree flow of relevant information. People openly and honestly \nexpress their opinions, share their feelings, and articulate their \ntheories. They willingly and capably share their views, even when \ntheir ideas are controversial or unpopular. It's the one thing, and \nit's precisely what Kevin and the other extremely effective com­\nmunicators we studied were routinely able to achieve. \nNow, to put a label on this spectacular talent-it's called dia­\nlogue. \ndi·a·logue or di·a·log (di' a-lOg\", -log) n \nThe free flow of meaning between two or more people.\n\f\nMASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 21 \nHE RE'S HOW DIALOGUE WORKS \nDespite the fact that we've shared the one thing, we're still left \nwith two questions. First, how does this free flow of meaning lead \nto success? Second, what can you do to encourage meaning to \nflow freely? \nWe'll explain the relationship between the free flow of mean­\ning and success right here and now. The second question-what \nyou must do to stay in dialogue, no matter the circumstances­\ntakes the rest of the book. \nFilling the Pool of Shar ed Meaning \nEach of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, \ntheories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique \ncombination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal \npool of meaning. This pool not only informs us but also propels \nour every action. \nWhen two or more of us enter crucial conversations, by defi­\nnition we don't share the same pool. Our opinions differ. I \nbelieve one thing, you another. I have one history, you another. \nPeople who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe \nfor everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool-e ven \nideas that at first glance appear controver sial, wrong, or at odds \nwith their own beliefs. Now, obviously they don't agree with \nevery idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find \ntheir way into the open. \nAs the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in \ntwo ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate \nand relevant information, they make better choices. In a very \nreal sense, the Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of a \ngroup's IQ. The larger the shared pool, the smarter the deci­\nsions. And even though many people may be involved in a \nchoice. when people openly and freely share ideas, the\n\f\n22 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nincreased time investment is more than offset by the quality of \nthe decision. \nOn the other hand, we've all seen what happens when the \nshared pool is dangerou sly shall ow. When people purposefully \nwithhold meaning from one another, individually smart people \ncan do collectively stupid things. \nFor example, a client of ours shared the following story. \nA woman checked into the hospital to have a tonsillecto my, \nand the surgical team erroneously removed a portion of her foot. \nHow could this tragedy happen? In fact, why is it that ninety­\neight thousand hospital deaths each year stem from human \nerror?! In part because many health-care professionals are afraid \nto speak their minds. In this case, no less than seven people won­\ndered why the surgeon was working on the foot, but said noth­\ning. Meaning didn't freely flow because people were afraid to \nspeak up. \nOf course, hospitals don't have a monopoly on fear. In every \ninstance where bosses are smart, highly paid, confident, and out­\nspoken (i.e., most of the world), people tend to hold back their \nopinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power. \nOn the other hand, when people feel comfortable speaking up \nand meaning does flow freely, the shared pool can dramatically \nincrease a group's ability to make better decisions. Consider what \nhappened to Kevin's group. As everyone on the team began to \nexplain his or her opinion, people formed a more clear and com­\nplete picture of the circumstance s. \nAs they began to understand the whys and wherefores of dif­\nferent proposals, they built off one another. Eventual ly, as one \nidea led to the next, and then to the next, they came up with an \nalternative that no one had originally thought of and that all \nwholeheartedly supported. As a result of the free flow of mean­\ning, the whole (final choice) was truly greater than the sum of the \noriginal parts. In short:"

    "raw_text": "MASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 23 \nThe Pool of Shared Meaning \nis the birthplace of synergy. \nNot only does a shared pool help individuals make better \nchoices, but since the meaning is shared, people willingly act on \nwhatever decisions they make. As people sit through an open \ndiscussion where ideas are shared, they take part in the free flow \nof meaning. Eventually they understand why the shared solution \nis the best solution, and they're committed to act. For example, \nKevin and the other VPs didn't buy into their final choice simply \nbecause they were involved; they bought in because they under­\nstood. \nConver sely, when people aren't involved, when they sit back \nquietly during touchy conve rsations, they're rarely committed to \nthe final decision. Since their ideas remain in their heads and \ntheir opinions never make it into the pool, they end up quietly \ncriticizing and pas sively resisting. Worse still, when others force \ntheir ideas into the pool, people have a harder time accepting the \ninformation. They may say they're on board, but then walk away \nand follow through halfheartedly. To quote Samuel Butler, \"He \nthat complies against his will is of his own opinion still.\" \nThe time you spend up front establish ing a shared pool of \nmeaning is more than paid for by faster, more committed action \nlater on. \nFor example, if Kevin and the other leaders had not been \ncommitted to their relocation decision, terrible consequences \nwould have followed. Some people would have agreed to move; \nothers would have dragged their feet. Some would have held \nheated discus sions in the hallways . Others would have said noth­\ning and then quietly fought the plan. More likely than not, the \nteam would have been forced to meet again, discuss again, and \ndecide again-since only one person favored the decision and the \ndecision affected everyone .\n\f\n24 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nNow, don't get us wrong. We're not suggesting that every \ndecision be made by consensus or that the boss shouldn't take \npart in or even make the final choice. We're simply suggesting \nthat whatever the decision-making method, the greater the \nshared meaning in the pool, the better the choice-whoever \nmakes it. \nEvery time we find ourselves arguing, debating, running away, \nor otherwise acting in an ineffective way, it's because we don't \nknow how to share meaning. Instead of engaging in healthy dia­\nlogue, we play silly and costly games. \nFor instance, sometimes we move to silence. We play Salute \nand Stay Mute. That is, we don't confront people in positions of \nauthority. Or at home we may play Freeze Your Lover. With this \ntortured technique we give loved ones the cold shoulder in order \nto get them to treat us better (what's the logic in that?). \nSometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, innuendo, and looks of \ndisgust to make our points. We play the martyr and then pretend \nwe're actually trying to help. Afraid to confront an individual, we \nblame an entire team for a problem-hoping the message will hit \nthe right target. Whatever the technique, the overall method is \nthe same. We withhold meaning from the pool. We go to silence. \nOn other occasions, not knowing how to stay in dialogue, we \nrely on violence- anything from subtle manipulation to verbal \nattacks. We act like we know everything, hoping people will \nbelieve our argument s. We discredit others, hoping people won't \nbelieve their argument s. And then we use every manner of force \nto get our way. We borrow power from the boss; we hit people \nwith biased monologues. The goal, of course, is always the \nsame- to compel others to our point of view. \nNow , here's how the various elements fit together. When stakes \nare high, opinions va ry, and emotions run strong, we're often at \nour worst. In order to move to our best, we have to find a way to \nexplain what is in each of our personal pools of meaning-\n\f\nMASTERING CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS 25 \nespecially our high-stakes, sensitive, and controversial opinions, \nfeelings, and ideas-a nd to get others to share their pools. We \nhave to develop the tools that make it safe for us to discuss these \nissues and to come to a shared pool of meaning. And when we do, \nour lives change. \nDIAL OGUE SKI LLS ARE LEARNABLE \nAnd now for the really good news. The skills required to master \nhigh-stakes interactions are quite easy to spot and moderately \neasy to learn. First consider the fact that a well-handled crucial \nconversation all but leaps out at you. In fact, when you see some­\none enter the dangerous waters of a high-stakes, high-emotion, \ncontroversial discussion-and the person does a particularly \ngood job- your natural reaction is to step back in awe. \"Wow!\" \nis generally the first word out of your mouth. What starts as a \ndoomed discussion ends up with a healthy resolution. It can take \nyour breath away. \nMore importantly, not only are dialogue skills easy to spot, but \nthey're also fairly easy to learn. That's where we're going next. \nWe've isolated and captured the skills of the dialogue-gifted \nthrough twenty-five years of nonstop \"Wow!\" research. First we \nfollowed around Kevin and dozens like him. Then, when conver­\nsations turned crucial, we took detailed notes. Afterward we \ncompared our observations, tested our hypotheses, and honed \nour models until we found the skills that consistently explain the \nsuccess of brilliant communicators. Finally, we combined our \nphilosophies, theories, models, and skills into a package of learn­\nable tools-tools for talking when stakes are high. \nNow we're ready to share what we've learned. Stay with us as \nwe explore how to transform crucial convers ations from fright­\nenin g events into interactions that yield success and results. It's \nthe mosl important set of skills you'll ever master."

    "raw_text": "26 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nHERE'S WH ERE WE'RE GOING \nHere's what we'll focus on in the remainder of the book. \nFirst, we'll explore the tools people use to help create the con­\nditions of dialogue. The focus is on how we think about problem \nsituations and what we do to prepare for them. As we work on \nourselves, watch for problems, examine our own thought \nprocesses, discover our own styles, and then catch problems \nbefore they get out of hand, everyone benefits. As you read on, \nyou will learn how to crea te conditions in yourself and others \nthat make dialogue the path of least resistance. \nNext, we'll examine the tools for talking, listening, and acting \ntogether. This is what most people have in mind when they think \nof crucial conversations. How do I express delicate feedback? \nHow do I speak persuas ively, not abrasively? And how about lis­\ntening? Or better still, what can we do to get people to talk when \nthey seem nervo us? And how do we move from thought to \naction? As you read on, you will learn the key skills of talking, \nlistening, and acting together. \nFinally, we'll tie all of the theories and skills together by pro­\nviding both a model and an extended example. Then, to see if \nyou can really do what it takes, we provide seventeen situations \nthat would give most of us fits-e ven people who are gifted at \ndialogue. As you read on, you will master the tools for talking \nwhen stakes are high.\n\f\n3 \nMore than any time in history mankind faces a \ncrossroads. One path leads to despair and utter \nhopelessness, the other to total extinction. Let us \npray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly. \n-WOODY ALLEN \nStart with Heart \nHow to Stay Focused \non What You Really Want \nIt's time to tum to the how of dialogue. How do you encourage \nthe flow of meaning in the face of differing opinions and strong \nemotions? Given the average person's track record, it can't be all \nthat easy. In fact, given most people's long-standing habit of cost­\nly behaviors, it'll probably require a lot of effort. The truth is, \npeople can change. In fact, thousands of people we (the authors) \nhave worked with over the past decades have made lasting \nimprovements. But it requires work. You can't simply drink a \nmagic potion and walk away renewed. Instead, you'll need to \ntake a long hard look at yourself. \nIn fact, this is the first principle of dialogue-Start with \nll eart. That is, your own heart. If you can't get yourself right,\n\f\n28 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nyou'll have a hard time getting dialogue right. When conv ersa­\ntions become crucial you'll resort to the forms of communication \nthat you've grown up with-debate, silent treatment, manipula­\ntion, and so on. \nWHEN WE DON' T WORK ON ME FIRST \nLet's start with a true story. Two young sisters and their father scur­\nry into their hotel room after spending a hot afternoon at Disney­\nland. Given the repressive heat, the girls have consumed enough \nsoda pop to fill a small barrel . As the two bursting kids enter their \nroom, they have but one thought-to head for the head. \nSince the bathroom is a one-holer, it isn't long until a fight \nbreaks out. Both of the desperate children start arguing, pushing, \nand name-calling as they dance around the tiny bathroom. Event­\nually one calls out to her father for help. \n\"Dad, 1 got here first!\" \n\"I know, but 1 need to go worse!\" \n\"How do you know? You're not in my body. 1 didn't even go \nbefore we left this morning !\" \n\"Y ou're so selfish.\" \nDad proposes a plan. \"Girls, I'm not going to solve this for \nyou. You can stay in the bathroom and figure out who goes first \nand who goes second. There's only one rule. No hitting.\" \nAs the two antsy kids begin their crucial conversation, Dad \nchecks his watch. He wonders how long it'll take. As the minutes \nslowly tick away, he hears nothing more than an occasional out­\nburst of sarcasm. Finally after twenty-five long minut es, the toi­\nlet flushes. One girl comes out. A minute later, another flush and \nout walks her sister. With both girls in the room, Dad asks, \"D o \nyou know how many times both of you could have gone to the \nbathroom in the time it took you to work that out?\" \nThe idea had not occurred to the little scamps, but the instant \nit does, it's obvious what both immediately conclude.\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 29 \n\"Lots of times, if she hadn't been such a jerk.\" \n\"L isten to her. She's calling me names when she could have \njust waited. She always has to have her way!\" \nDON' T LOOK AT ME! \nLaugh as we may at this story, these two kids behave no differ­\nently from the rest of us. When faced with a failed conv ersation, \nmost of us are quick to blame others. If others would only \nchange, then we'd all live happily ever after. If others weren't so \nscrewed up, we wouldn't have to resort to silly games in the first \nplace. They started it. It's their fault, not ours. And so on. \nAlthough it's true that there are times when we are merely \nbystanders in life's never-ending stream of head-on collisions, \nrarely are we completely innocent . More often than not, we do \nsomething to contribute to the problems we're experiencing. \nPeople who are best at dialogue understand this simple fact and \ntum it into the principle \"Work on me first.\" They realize that not \nonly are they likely to benefit by improving their own approach, \nbut also that they're the only person they can work on anyway. As \nmuch as others may need to change, or we may want them to \nchange, the only person we can continually inspire, prod, and \nshape-with any degree of success-is the person in the mirror. \nThere's a certain irony embedded in this fact. People who \nbelieve they need to start with themselves do just that. As they \nwork on themselves, they also become the most skilled at dia­\nlogue. So here's the irony. It's the most talented, not the least tal­\nented, who are continually trying to improve their dialogue \nskills. As is often the case, the rich get richer. \nSTART WITH HEART \nOkay, let's assume we need to work on our own personal dia­\nlugue skil ls. In stead of buying this book and then handing it to a\n\f\n30 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nloved one or coworker and saying: \"You'll love this, especially \nthe parts that I've underlined for you,\" we'll try to figure out how \nwe ourselves can benefit. But how? Where do we start? How can \nwe stay clear of unhealthy games? \nAlthough it's difficult to describe the specific order of even ts \nin an interaction as fluid as a crucial conver sation, we do know \none thing for certain: Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, \nthey begin high-risk discussions with the right motive s, and they \nstay focused no matter what happens. \nThey maintain this focus in two ways. First, they're steely-eyed \nsmart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite con­\nstant invitations to slip away from their goals, they stick with \nthem. Second, skilled people don't make Sucker's Choices \n(either/or choices). Unlike others who justify their unhealthy \nbehavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or \ntake flight, the dialogue-smart believe that dialogue, no matter \nthe circumstance s, is always an option. \nLet's look at each of these important heart-based assumptions \nin turn. \nA MOM ENT OF TRUTH \nTo see how the desires of our hearts can affect our ability to stay \nin dialogue, let's take a look at a real-life example. \nGreta, the CEO of a mid-sized corporation, is two hours into \na rather tense meeting with her top leaders. For the past six \nmonths she has been on a personal campaign to reduce costs. \nLittle has been accomplished to date, so Greta calls the meeting. \nSurely people will tell her why they haven't started cutting costs. \nAfter all, she has taken great pains to foster candor. \nGreta has just opened the meeting to questions when a man­\nager haltingly rises to his feet, fidgets, stares at the floor, and \nthen nervously asks if he can ask a very tough question. The way\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 31 \nthe fellow emphasizes the word very makes it sound as if he's \nabout to accuse Greta of kidnapping the Lindbergh bab y. \nThe frightened manager continues. \n\"Greta, you've been at us for six months to find ways to cut \ncosts. I'd be lying if I said that we've given you much more than \na lukewarm response. If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you about \none thing that's making it tough for us to push for cost cuts .\" \n\"Great. Fire away,\" Greta says as she smiles in response. \n\"Well, while you've been asking us to use both sides of our paper \nand forego improvements, you're having a second office built.\" \nGreta freezes and turns bright red. Everyone looks to see what \nwill happen next. The manager plunges on ahead. \n\"The rumor is that the furniture alone will cost $1 50,000. Is \nthat right?\" \nSo there we have it. The conversation has just turned crucial. \nSomeone has just poured a rather ugly tidbit into the pool of \nmeaning. Will Greta continue to encourage honest feedback, or \nwill she shut the fellow down? \nWe call this a crucial conversation because how Greta acts \nduring the next few moments will not only set people's attitudes \ntoward the proposed cost cutting, but will also have a huge \nimpact on what the other leaders think about her. Does she walk \nthe talk of openness and honesty? Or is she a raging hypocrite­\nlike so many of the senior executives who came before her? \nWill We Get Hooked ? \nHow Greta behaves during this crucial conversation depends a \ngreat deal on how she handles her emotions while under attack. \nSure, when she's giving a speech or writing a memo, she's all for \ncandor. She's a veri table cheerleader for candor. But what about \nnow? Will Greta thank the fellow for taking a huge risk and \nbeing honest?\n\f\n32 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nIf she's like most of us, Greta will defend herself. When we're \nin the throes of high-stakes conv ersations, new (and less healthy) \nmotives often supplant our original, more noble ones . If you are \nstanding in front of a potentially hostile crowd, it's a good bet \nyou will change your original goal to the new goal of protecting \nyour public image. \n\"Excuse me,\" you might respond. \"I don't think that my new \noffice is an appropriate topic for this forum.\" \nBang. You're dead. In one fell swoop you've lost buy-in, \ndestroyed any hope for candor in this particular conv ersation, \nand confirmed everyone's suspicion that you want honesty-but \nonly as long as it makes you look good. \nFI RST, FOCUS ON WHAT YOU REAll Y WANT \nIn reality, Greta didn't give in to her raging desire to defend her­\nself. After being accused of not following her own advice, at first \nshe looked surprised, embarra ssed, and maybe even a little \nupset. Then she took a deep breath and said: \"You know what? \nWe need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. It'll \ngive us a chance to discuss what's really going on.\" \nAnd then Greta talked turkey. She explained that she felt the \noffice was necessary but admitted that she had no idea what it \nwould cost. So she sent someone to check the number s. \nMeanwhile, she explained that building the office was a response \nto marketing's advice to boost the company's image and improve \nclient confidence. And while Greta would use the office, it would \nbe primarily a hosting location for marketing. When she saw the \nfigures for the office, Greta was stunned and adm itted that she \nshould have checked the costs before signing a work order. So \nthen and there she committed to drawing up a new plan that \nwould cut costs by half or canceling the project entirely.\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 33 \nLater that day we asked Greta how she had been able to keep \nher composure under fire. We wanted to know exactly what had \nbeen going on in her head. What had helped her move from \nembarrassment and anger to gratitude? \n\"It was easy ,\" Greta explained. \"At first I did feel attacked, \nand I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that \nguy in his place. He was accusing me in public and he was \nwrong.\" \n\"And then it struck me,\" she continued. \"Despite the fact that I \nhad four hundred eyeballs pinned to me, a rather important ques­\ntion hit me like a ton of bricks: 'What do I really want here?'\" \nAsking this question had a powerful effect on Greta's think­\ning. As she focused on this far more important question, she \nquickly realized that her goal was to encourage these two hun­\ndred managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts-a nd to \nthereby influence thousands of others to do the same. \nAs Greta contemplated this goal, she realized that the biggest \nbarrier she faced was the widespread belief that she was a hyp­\nocrite. On the one hand, she was calling for others to sacrifice. \nOn the other, she appeared to be spending discretionary funds for \nher own comfort. It was at that moment that she was no longer \nashamed or angry, but grateful. She couldn't have asked for a bet­\nter opportunity to influence these leaders than the one offered up \nby this penetrating question. And so she moved to dialogue. \nRefocus your brain. Now, let's move to a situation you might \nface. You're speaking with someone who completely disagrees \nwith you on a hot issue. How does all of this goal stuff apply? As \nyou begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going \nin, ask yourself what you really want. \nAlso, as the conver sation unfolds and you find yourself start­\ning to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoul­\nder , pay attention to what's happening to your objectives. Are\n\f\n34 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nyou starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embar rass­\nment, win, be right, or punish others? Here's the tricky part. Our \nmotives usually change without any conscious thought on our \npart. When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow \nwith the chemical tide. \nIn order to move back to motives that allow for dialogue, you \nmust step away from the interaction and look at yours elf­\nmuch like an outsider. Ask yourself: \"What am I doing, and if I \nhad to guess, what does it tell me about my underlying motive ?\" \nAs you make an honest effort to discover your motive, you \nmight conclude: \"Let's see. I'm pushing hard, making the argu­\nment stronger than I actually believe, and doing anything to \nwin. I've shifted from trying to select a vacation location to try­\ning to win an argument .\" \nOnce you call into question the shifting desires of your heart, \nyou can make conscious choices to change them. \"What I really \nwant is to genuinely try to select a vacation spot we can all \nenjoy-rather than try to win people over to my ideas .\" Put suc­\ncinctly, when you name the game, you can stop playing it. \nBut how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, \nstop playing games, and then influence your own motives? Do \nwhat Greta did. Stop and ask yourself some questions that \nreturn you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when \nyou find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when \nyou prepare to step up to a crucial conversation. Here are some \ngreat ones: \nWhat do I really want for myself? \nWhat do I really want for others? \nWhat do I really want for the relationship? \nOnce you've asked yourself what you want, add one more \nequally telling question:\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 35 \nHow would I behave if I really wanted these results? \nFind your bearings. There are two good reasons for asking these \nquestions. First, the answer to what we really want helps us to \nlocate our own North Star. Despite the fact that we're being tempt­\ned to take the wrong path by (1) people who are trying to pick a \nfight, (2) thousands of years of genetic hardwiring that brings our \nemotions to a quick boil, and (3) our deeply ingrained habit of try­\ning to win, our North Star returns us to our original purpose. \n\"What do I really want? Oh yeah, I guess it's not to make \nthe other person squirm or to preen in front of a crowd. I \nwant people to freely and openly talk about what it'll take \nto cut costs .\" \nTake charge of your body. The second reason for asking what \nwe really want is no less important. When we ask ourselves what \nwe really want, we affect our entire physiology. As we introduce \ncomplex and abst ract questions to our mind, the problem-solv­\ning part of our brain recognizes that we are now dealing with \nintricate social issues and not physical threats. When we present \nour brain with a demanding question, our body sends precious \nblood to the parts of our brain that help us think, and away from \nthe parts of our body that help us take flight or begin a fight. \nAsking questions about what we really want serve s two \nimportant purpo ses. First, it reminds us of our goal. Second, it \njuices up our brain in a way that helps us keep focused. \nComm on Deviations \nAs we step up to a crucial conversation, fully intending to stim­\nul ate the flow of meaning, many of us quickly change our origi­\nIlal objectives to much less healthy goals. For instance, when \nGreta fell un der public attack, her immediate reaction was to do\n\f\n36 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nwhatever it took to save face. Other common, but not·all-that­\nhealthy, objectives include wanting to win, seeking revenge, and \nhoping to remain safe. \nWant ing to win. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top \nof many of our lists. Heaven only knows that we come by this \ndeadly passion naturally enough. Half of the lV programs we \nwatch make heroes out of people who win at sports or game \nshows. Ten minutes into kindergarten we learn that if we want \nto get the teacher's attention, we have to spout the right answer. \nThat means we have to beat our fellow students at the same \ngame. This desire to win is built into our very fiber before we're \nold enough to know what's going on. \nUnf ortunate ly, as we grow older, most of us don't realize that \nthis desire to win is continually driving us away from healthy dia­\nlogue. We start out with the goal of resolving a problem, but as \nsoon as someone raises the red flag of inaccuracy or challenges \nour correctness, we switch purposes in a heartbeat. \nFirst we correct the facts. We quibble over details and point \nout flaws in the other person's arguments. \n\"You're wrong! We're not spending anywhere near a hun­\ndred and fifty thous and dollars on the furniture. It's the \nredesign of the office that's costing so much, not the fur­\nniture .\" \nOf course, as others push back, trying to prove their points, \nit's not long until we change our goal from correcting mistakes \nto winning. \nIf you doubt this simple allegation, think of the two antsy \nyoung girls as they stared each other down in the cramped bath­\nroom. Their original goal was simple enough-relief. But soon, \ncaught up in their own painful game, the two set their ja ws and \ncommitted to doing whatever it took to win-even if it brought \nthem a fair amount of personal discomfort."

    "raw_text": "START WITH HEART 37 \nSeeking revenge. Sometimes, as our anger increa ses, we move \nfrom wanting to win the point to wanting to harm the other per­\nson. Just ask Greta. \"To heck with honest communication !\" she \nthinks to herself. \"I'll teach the moron not to attack me in pub­\nlic.\" Eventuall y, as emotions reach their peak, our goal becomes \ncompletely perverted. We move so far away from adding mean­\ning to the pool that now all we want is to see others suffer. \n\"I can't believe that you're accusing me of squandering \ngood money on a perfectly fine office. Now, if nobody else \nhas any intelligent questions, let's move on !\" \nEveryone immediately clams up and looks at the floor. The \nsilence is deafening. \nHoping to remain safe. Of course, we don't always fix mis­\ntakes, aggressively discredit others, or heartlessly try to make \nthem suffer. Sometimes we choose personal safety over dialogue. \nRather than add to the pool of meaning, and possibly make \nwaves along the way, we go to silence. We're so uncomfortable \nwith the immediate conflict that we accept the certaint y of bad \nresults to avoid the possib ility of uncomfortable conv ersation. \nWe choose (at least in our minds) peace over conflict. Had this \nhappened in Greta's case, nobody would have raised concerns \nover the new office, Greta never would have learned the real \nissue, and people would have continued to drag their feet. \nSECOND, REFUSE THE SUCKER'S CHOICE \nNow, let's add one more tool that helps us focus on what we real­\nly want.

    "raw_text": "38 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthirty-three years, considers himself the elder statesm an of \nthe school. He's much more fond of war stories than he is of \nneutrons and electrons, but the administration kind of turns \na blind eye, because the guy's a fixture. \nAt the principal's cue, Royce clears his throat and begins to \nyammer on incoherently about the similarities between curricu­\nlum development and battle preparations. His antics are so \nembarra ssing that the audience quietly heaves their shoulders as \nthey futilely try to stifle their laughter. \nNext, it's Brent's, the new guy's, turn. A couple of weeks ago, \nthe principal asked him to outline the science department's pro­\nposed curriculum changes. Brent met with his colleagues (even \nRoyce), gathered suggestions, and came ready to present. \nAs Brent begins, Royce starts demonstrating bayonet offen­\nsives with a yardstick, and Brent snaps. Slamming his fist on the \ntable, he shouts, \"Am I the only one who wonders why we even \nallow this fosil to talk? Did he miss a pill or something? \" \nA room full of stunned faces turns toward Brent. Realizing \nthat his colleagues must think he's possessed, Brent utters those \nwords we've all come to hate, \"Hey, don't look at me like that! \nI'm the only one around who has the guts to speak the truth.\" \nWhat a tactic. Brent slams Royce in public, and then instead \nof apologizing or maybe simply fading into the shadows, he \nargues that what he just did was somehow noble. \nTwo ugly options. This pernicious strategy is particularly well \nsuited for keeping us off track. It's known as a Sucker's Choice. \nIn order to jus tify an especially sordid behavior, we suggest that \nwe're caught between two distas teful options. Either we can be \nhonest and attack our spouse, or we can be kind and withhold \nthe truth. Either we can disagree with the boss to help make a \nbetter choice-and get shot for it-or we can remain quiet, \nstarve the pool, and keep our job . Pick your poison.\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 39 \nWhat makes these Sucker's Choices is that they're always \nset up as the only two options ava ilable. It's the worst of \neither/or thinking. The person making the choice never sug­\ngests there's a third option that doesn't call for unhealthy \nbehavior. For example, maybe there's a way to be honest and \nrespectful. Perhaps we can express our candid opinion to our \nboss and be safe. \nThose offering up a Su cker's Choice either don't think of a \nthird (and healthy) option-in which case it's an honest but \ntragic mistak e-or set up the false dichotomy as a way of jus­\ntifying their unattractive actions. \"I'm sorry, but I just had to \ndestroy the guy's self-image if I was going to keep my integrit y. \nIt wasn't pretty, but it was the right thing to do.\" \nOpen Yourself to Change \nNot only do Sucker's Choices set us up to take ineffective \nactions, but they close us down to change. They present our \nbrain with problems easily solved with restr icted blood flow. \nAfter all, if we are simply choosing between fight and flight, \nwho needs much creative thought? \nThey also keep us stuck in ineffective strat egies by jus tifying \nour attacking or retreating behav iors. Why alter our behavior \nwhen we're the only one savvy enough to keep quiet? \"St and \nup to my boss? What turnip wagon did you just fall off?\" \"Tell \nmy spouse that her parental style is too controlling? No way. \nI' ll pay for years .\" In a similar vein, why would you ever change \nwhen you think you're the only one around with an ounce of \nintegrity? \"Somebody has to state the ugly truth. It's the only \nway I can look myself in the mirror.\" \nIn summ ary, Sucker's Choices are simplistic tradeoffs that \nkeep us r rom thinking creatively of ways to get to dialogue, and \nthat justi fy our silly games.\n\f\n40 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nSo how do we break away from perverted logic that keeps us \ntrapped in hurtful behavior? \nSearch for the Elusive And \nThe best at dialogue refuse Sucker's Choices by setting up new \nchoices. They present themselves with tougher question s­\nquestions that turn the either/or choice into a search for the all­\nimportant and ever-elusive and. (It is an endangered species, \nyou know.) Here's how this works. \nFirst, clarify what you really want. You've got a head start if \nyou've already Started with Heart. If you know what you want \nfor yourself, for others, and for the relationship, then you're in \nposition to break out of the Sucker's Choice. \n\"What I want is for my husband to be more reliable. I'm \ntired of being let down by him when he makes commit­\nments that I depend on.\" \nSecond, clarify what you really don't want. This is the key to \nframing the and question. Think of what you are afraid will \nhappen to you if you back away from your current strategy of \ntrying to win or stay safe. What bad thing will happen if you \nstop pushing so hard? Or if you don't try to escape? What hor­\nrible outcome makes game-playing an attractive and sensible \noption? \n\"What I don't want is to have a useless and heated conver­\nsation that creates bad feelings and doesn't lead to change.\" \nThird, present your brain with a more complex problem. \nFinally, combine the two into an and question that forces you to \nsearch for more creative and productive options than silence and \nviolence.\n\f\nSTART WITH HEART 41 \n\"How can I have a candid conversation with my husband \nabout being more dependable and avoid creating bad feel­\nings or wasting our time?\" \nIt's interesting to watch what happens when people are pre­\nsented with and questions after being stuck with Sucker's \nChoices. Their faces become reflective, their eyes open wider, \nand they begin to think. With surprising regularity, when people \nare asked: \"Is it possible that there's a way to accomplish both?\" \nthey acknowledge that there very well may be. \nIs there a way to tell your peer your real concerns and not insult \nor offend him? \nIs there a way to talk to your neighbors about their annoying \nbehavior and not come across as self-righteous or demanding? \nIs there a way to talk with your loved one about how you're \nspending money and not get into an argument? \nIS THIS REAll Y POSSI BLE? \nSome people find this whole line of thinking comically unrealis­\ntic. From their point of view, Sucker's Choices aren't false \ndichotomies; they're merely a reflection of an unfortunate reality. \n\"You can't say something to the boss about our upcoming \nmove . It'll cost you your job.\" \nTo these people we say: Remember Kevin? He, and almost every \nother opinion leader we've ever studied, has what it takes to speak \nup and maintain respect.

Did you \nnotice how at one point all of our jaws dropped simultaneously? \nOf course, I was just as bad as the boss.

That \nis, when things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the con­\nversation along with what people are doing. I look for and exam­\nine both what and why.

    "raw_text": "LEARN TO LOOK 47 \nYou can't believe how obvious this advice is-and yet you've \nnever thought of such a thing. Weirder still, your friend has. In \nfact, he has a whole vocabulary for what's going on during a cru­\ncial conversation. It's as if you've been speaking another language. \nWATCH FOR COND ITIONS \nIn truth, most of us do have trouble dual-processing (watching \nfor content and conditions)-especially when it comes to a cru­\ncial conversation. When both stakes and emotions are high, we \nget so caught up in what we're saying that it can be nearly impos­\nsible to pull ourselves out of the argument in order to see what's \nhappening to ourselves and to others. Even when we are startled \nby what's going on, enough so that we think: \"Yipes ! This has \nturned ugly. Now what?\" we may not know what to look for in \norder to turn things around . We may not see enough of what's \nhappening. \nHow could that be? How could we be smack-dab in the mid­\ndle of a heated debate and not really see what's going on? A \nmetaphor might help. It's akin to going fly fishing for the first \ntime with an experienced angler. Your buddy keeps telling you to \ncast your fly six feet upstream from that brown trout \"just out \nthere.\" Only you can't see a brown trout \"just out there.\" He can. \nThat's because he knows what to look for. You think you do. You \nthink you need to look for a brown trout. In reality, you need to \nlook for a brown trout that's under water while the sun is reflect­\ning in your eyes. You have to look for elements other than the \nthing that your dad has stuffed and mounted over the fireplace. \nI t takes both knowledge and practice to know what to look for \nand then actually see it. \nSo what do you look for when caught in the middle of a cru­\ncia l conversation? What do you need to see in order to catch \nproblems before they become too severe? Actually, it helps to \nwatch fot' three different conditi ons: the moment a conversation\n\f\n48 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nturns crucial, signs that people don't feel safe (silence or vio­\nlence), and your own Style Under Stress. Let's consider each of \nthese conversation killers in turn. \nlearn to Spot Crucial Conversati ons \nFirst, stay alert for the moment a conver sation turns from a rou­\ntine or harmless discussion into a crucial one. In a similar vein, \nas you anticipate entering a tough conv ersation, pay heed to the \nfact that you're about to enter the danger zone. Otherwise, yoti \ncan easily get sucked into silly games before you realize what's \nhappened. And as we suggested earlier, the further you stray off \ntrack, the harder it can be to return. \nTo help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to pay \nattention to the signs that suggest you're in a crucial conver sa­\ntion. Some people first notice physical signals-their stomach \ngets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your \nbody when conversations get tough. Everyone is a little bit dif· \nferent. What are your cues? Whatever they are, learn to look at \nthem as signs to step back, slow down, and Start with Heart before \nthings get out of hand. \nOthers notice their emotions before they notice signs in theit \nbody. They realize they are scared, hurt, or angry and are begin­\nning to react to or suppress these feelings. These emotions can \nalso be great cues to tell you to step back, slow down, and take \nsteps to turn your brain back on. \nSome people's first cue is not physical or emotional, but \nbehavioral. It's like an out-of-body experience. They see them­\nselves raising their voice, pointing their finger like a loaded \nweapon, or becoming very quiet. It's only then that they realize \nhow they're feeling. \nSo take a moment to think about some of your toughe st con­\nversatio ns. What cues can you use to recognize that your brain"

    "raw_text": "LEARN TO LOOK 49 \nis beginning to disengage and you're at risk of moving away from \nhealthy dialogue? \nlearn to look for Safety Problems \nIf you can catch signs that the conversation is starting to tum cru­\ncial- before you get sucked so far into the actual argument that \nyou can never withdraw from the content-then you can start \ndual-processing immediately. And what exactly should you watch \nfor? People who are gifted at dialogue keep a constant vigil on \nsafety. They pay attention to the content-t hat's a given-and \nthey watch for signs that people are afraid. When friends, loved \nones, or colleagues move away from healthy dialogue (freely \nadding to the pool of meaning) -either forcing their opinions \ninto the pool or purposefully keeping their ideas out of the pool­\nthey immediately tum their attention to whether or not others feel \nsafe. \nWhen it's safe, you can say anything. Here's why gifted com­\nmunicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free \nflow of meaning-pe riod. And nothing kills the flow of meaning \nlike fear. When you fear that people aren't buying into your \nideas, you start pushing too hard. When you fear that you may \nbe harmed in some way, you start withdrawing and hiding. Both \nthese reactions-to fight and to take flight-are motivated by \nthe same emotion: fear. On the other hand, if you make it safe \nenough, you can talk about almost anything and people wi1l lis­\nten. If you don't fear that you're being attacked or humiliated, \nyou yourself can hear almost anything and not become defensive. \nThink about your own experience. Can you remember receiv­\ning really blistering feedback from someone at some point in your \nlife, but in this instance you didn't become defensive? Instead, \nyou ab sorbed the feedback. You reflected on it. You allowed it to \ninf luence you. If so, ask yourself why. Why in this instance were\n\f\n50 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nyou able to absorb potentially threatening feedback so well? If \nyou're like the rest of us, it's because you believed that the other \nperson had your best interest in mind. In addition, you respected \nthe other person's opinion. You felt safe receiving the feedback \nbecause you trusted the motives and ability of the other person. \nYou didn't need to defend yourself from what was being said. \nOn the other hand, if you don't feel safe, you can't take any \nfeedback. It's as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. \"What do \nyou mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you rib­\nbing me?\" When you don't feel safe, even well-intended com­\nments are suspect. \nWhen it's unsafe, you start to go blind. By carefully watching \nfor safety violations, not only can you see when dialogue is in \ndanger, but you can also reengage your brain. As we've said \nbefore, when your emotions start cranking up, key brain func­\ntions start shutting down. Not only do you prepare to take flight, \nbut your peripheral vision actually narrows. In fact, when you \nfeel genuinely threatened, you can scarcely see beyond what's \nright in front of you. Similarly, when you feel the outcome of a \nconversation is being threatened, you have a hard time seeing \nbeyond the point you're trying to make. By pulling yourself out \nof the content of an argument and watching for fear, you reen­\ngage your brain and your full vision return s. \nDon't let safety problems lead you astray. Let's add a note of \ncaution. When others begin to feel unsafe, they start doing nasty \nthings. Now, since they're feeling unsaf e, you should be thinking \nto yourself: \"Hey, they're feeling unsafe . I need to do some­\nthing-maybe make it safer.\" That's what you should be think­\ning. Unfortunate ly, since others feel unsaf e, they may be trying to \nmake fun of you, insult you, or bowl you over with their argu­\nments. This kind of aggressive behavior doesn't exactly bring out \nthe diplomat in you. So instead of taking their attack as a sign \nthat safety is at risk, you take it at its face-as an attack. \"I 'm\n\f\nLEARN TO LOOK 51 \nunder attack !\" you think. Then you respond in kind . Or maybe \nyou try to escape. Either way you're not dual-processing and \nthen pulling out a skill to restore safety. Instead, you're becom­\ning part of the problem as you get pulled into the fight. \nImagine the magnitude of what we're suggesting here. We're \nasking you to recode silence and violence as signs that people are \nfeeling unsaf e. We're asking you to fight your natural tendency \nto respond in kind . We're asking you to undo years of practice, \nmaybe even eons of genetic shaping that prod you to take flight \nor pick a fight (when under attack), and recode the stimulu s. \n\"Ah, that's a sign that the other person feels unsaf e.\" And then \nwhat? Do something to make it safe. In the next chapter we'll \nexplore how. For now, simply learn to look for safety and then be \ncurious, not angry or frightened. \nSilenc e and Violence \nAs people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two \nunhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding mean­\ning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force meaning in the \npool). That part we know. But let's add a little more detail. Just \nas a little knowledge of what to look for can tum blurry water \ninto a brown trout, knowing a few of the common forms of \nsilence and violence helps you see safety problems when they \nfirst start to happen . That way you can step out, restore safety , \nand return to dialogue-be fore the damage is too great. \nSilence \nSi lence consists of any act to purposefully withhold information \nfrom the pool of meaning. It's almost always done as a means of \nav oiding potential problems, and it always restricts the flow of \nmeaning. Methods range from playing verbal games to avoiding \nu person entirely. The three most common forms of silence are \nmas king. avoiding, and withdrawing.\n\f\n52 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n• Masking consists of understating or selectively showing our \ntrue opinions . Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some \nof the more popular forms. \n\"J think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, that's it. J just worry \nthat others won 't catch the subtle nua nces. Some ideas come \nbefore their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance. \" \nMeaning: Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their \nlast breath. \n\"Oh yeah, that'll work like a charm. Offer people a discount , \nand they'll drive all the way across town just to save six cents \non a box of soap. Where do you come up with this stuff?\" \nMeaning: What a dumb idea. \n• Avoiding involves steering completely away from senSItIve \nsubj ects. We talk, but without addressing the real issues. \n\"How does your new suit look? Well, you know that blue's my \nfavorite color. \" \nMeaning: What happened? Did you buy your clothes at the \ncircus? \n\"Speaking of ideas for cost cutting -did you see Friends last \nnight? Joey inherited a bun ch of money and was buying stu­\npid stuff. It was a hoot. \" \nMeaning: Let's not talk about how to cut costs. It always leads \nto a fight. \n• Withdrawing means pulling out of a conversation altogether. \nWe either exit the conversation or exit the room. \n\"Excuse me. I've got to take this call. \" \nMeaning: I'd rather gnaw off my own arm than spend one \nmore minute in this useless meeting.\n\f\nLEARN TO LOOK 53 \n\"Sorry, I'm not going to talk about how to split up the phone \nbill again. I'm not sure our friendship can stand another bat­\ntle. \" (Exits.) \nMeaning: We can't talk about even the simplest of topics with­\nout arguing. \nVio lence \nViolence consists of any verbal strategy that attempts to convince, \ncontrol, or compel others to your point of view. It violates safety \nby trying to force meaning into the pool. Methods range from \nname-calling and monologuing to making threats. The three most \ncommon forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking. \n• Cont rolling consists of coercing others to your way of thinking. \nIt's done through either forcing your views on others or domi­\nnating the convers ation. Methods include cutting others off, \noverstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing sub­\njects, or using directive questions to control the conversation. \n'There's not a person in the world who hasn 't bought one of \nthese things. They're the perfect gift. \" \nMeaning: I can't jus tify spending our hard-earned savings on \nthis expensive toy, but I really want it. \n\"We tried their product, but it was an absolute disaster. Every­\none knows that they can 't deliver on time and that they offer the \nworst customer service on the planet. \" \nMeaning: I'm not certain of the real facts so I'll use hyperbole \nto get your attention. \n• Labeling is putting a label on people or ideas so we can dis­\nmiss them under a general stereotype or category . \n.. Your ideas are practically Nea nderthal. Any thinking person \nwould follow my plan. \"\n\f\n54 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nMeaning: I can't argue my case on its merits. \n\"Y ou're not going to listen to them are you? For crying out loud! \nFirst, they're from headquarters. Second, they're engineers. Need \nI say more?\" \nMeaning: If I pretend that all people from headquarters and all \nengineers are somehow bad and wrong, I won't have to explairl \nanything . \n• Attacking speaks for itself. You've moved from winning the \nargument to making the person suffer. Tactics include belittling \nand threatening. \n\"Try that stupid little stunt and see what happens. \" \nMeani ng: I will get my way on this even if I have to bad-mouth \nyou and threaten some vague puni shment. \n\"Don 't listen to a word Jim is saying. I'm sorry Jim, but I'm on \nto you. You're just trying to make it better for your team while \nmaking the rest of us suffer. I've seen you do it before. You're \na real jerk, you know that? I'm sorry, but someone has to have \nthe guts to tell it like it is. \" \nMeaning: To get my way I'll say bad things about you and then \npretend that I'm the only one with any integrity. \nlook for Your Style Under Stress \nLet's say you've been watching for both content and conditions! \nYou're paying special attention to when a conversation turns cru­\ncial. To catch this important moment, you're looking for signs \nthat safety is at risk. As safety is violated, you even know to \nwatch for variou s forms of silence and violence . So are you now \nfully armed? Have you seen all there is to see? \nActually, no. Perhaps the most difficult element to watch \nclosely as you're madly dual-processing is your own behavi or.\n\f\nLEARN TO LOOK 55 \nFrankly, most people have trouble pulling themselves away from \nthe tractor beam of the argument at hand. Then you've got the \nproblem other people present as they employ all kinds of tactics. \nYou've got to watch them like a hawk. It's little wonder that pay­\ning close attention to your own behavior tends to take a back­\nseat. Besides, it's not like you can actually step out of your body \nand observe yourself. You're on the wrong side of your eyeballs . \nLow selfmon itors. The truth is, we all have trouble monitor­\ning our own behavior at times. We usually lose any semblance of \nsocial sensitivity when we become so consumed with ideas and \ncauses that we lose track of what we're doing. We try to bully \nour way through. We speak when we shouldn't. We do things \nthat don't work-all in the name of a cause. We eventually \nbecome so unaware that we become a bit like this fellow of Jack \nHandy's invent ion. \n«People were always talking about how mean this guy was \nwho lived on our block. But I decided to go see for myself. \nI went to his door, but he said he wasn't the mean guy, the \nmean guy lived in that house over there. 'No, you stupid \nidiot, ' I said, 'that's my house. '\" \nUnf ortunately, when you fail to monitor your own behavior, \nyou can look pretty silly. For example, you're talking to your \nspouse about the fact that he or she left you sitting at the auto \nrepair shop for over an hour. After pointing out that it was a sim­\nple misunderstanding, your spouse exclaims: \"You don't have to \nget angry.\" \nThen you utter those famous words: \"I'm not angry!\" \nOf course, you'r e spraying spit as you shout out your denial, \nand the vein on your forehead has swelled to the size of a teenage \npython. You, quite natural ly, don't see the inconsiste ncy in your \nresponse. You're in the middle of the whole thing, and you don't \nuppr cciatc it onc bit whcn your spouse laughs at you."

    "raw_text": "66 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nYvonne doesn't respond, he goes to silence. He pouts, says almost \nnothing, and avoids Yvonne for the next few days. \nYvonne knows what's going on with Jotham. Occasionally \nshe'll go along with him even when she's not feeling particularly \nromantic. She does this in hopes of avoiding Jotham's pouting. \nUnf ortunately, she then feels resen tful toward Jotham, and it's \nmuch longer before she feels genuinely romantic toward him. \nSo here's the game. The more Jotham insists and pouts, the less \nattractive and interesting he is to Yvonn e. The more Yvonne suc­\ncumb s and then resents, the less she's interested in the entire rela­\ntionship. The more both of them act out rather than talk out this \ncrucial conversation, the more likely they are to end up going \ntheir separate ways. Yvonne has decided to broach the subject \nwith Jotham. Rather than waiting until they're both upset, she's \npicked a time when they're relaxing on the couch. Here goes. \nYVONNE: Jotham, can we talk about what happened last \nnight-you know, when I told you that I was tired? \nJOTHAM: I don't know if I'm in the mood. \nYVONNE: What's that supposed to mean? \nJOTHAM: I'm sick and tired of you deciding when we do \nwhat ! \nYVONNE: (walks out) \nSTEP OUT. MAKE IT SAFE. THEN STEP BACK IN \nOkay, let's look at Yvonne. She tried to tackle a tough topic. \nGood for her. She was already uncomfortable and her partner \ntook a cheap shot at her. Some help he was. Now what should \nshe do? How can she get back to honest and healthy dialogue? \nWhat do you do when you don't feel like it's safe to share what's \non your mind?\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 67 \nThe key is to step out of the content of the conver sation. Don't \nstay stuck in what's being said. Yvonne exited because she was \nfocused on what Jotham was saying. If she had been looking at \nJotham's behavior, she would have spotted his use of sarcasm­\na form of masking. Rather than talking out his concern, he's tak­\ning a potshot. Why would he do that? Because he doesn 't feel \nsafe using dialogue. But Yvonne missed this point. \nNow, we're not suggesting that Jotham's behavior is acceptable, \nor that Yvonne should put up with it. But first things first-Start \nwith Heart. The first question is: \"What do I really want?\" \nIf you really want to have a healthy conversation about a topic \nthat will make or break your relationship, then for a moment or \ntwo you may have to set aside confronting the current issue­\ni.e., Jotham's sarcasm. \nYvonne's challenge here is to build safety-enough so that she \ncan talk about their physical relationship, about the way Jotham \nis dealing with it, or about any other concerns. But if she doesn't \nmake it safe, all she's going to get is a continuation of the silence \nand violence games. \nSo, what should she do? \nIn these circumstances, the worst at dialogue do what both \nJotham and Yvonne did. Like Jotham, they totally ignore the cry­\ning need for more safety. They say whatever is on their minds­\nwith no regard for how it will be received. Or like Yvonne, they \nconclude the topic is completely uns afe and move to silence. \nThe good realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly \nthe wrong way. They try to make the subject more palatable by \nsugarcoating their message. \"Oh, honey, I really want to be with \nyou but I'm under a lot of pressu re at work, and the stress makes \nit hard for me to enjoy our time together.\" They try to make \nthings safer by watering down their content. This strategy, of \nl:ourse, avoids the real problem, and it never gets fixed.\n\f\n68 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe best don't play games. They know that dialogue is the free \nflow of meaning- with no pretending, sugarcoating, or faking. \nSo they do something completely different. They step out of the \ncontent of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. \nOnce you've spotted safety problems, you can talk about the \nmost challenging of topics by stepping out of the content and \nbuilding enough safety that almost anything becomes discussable. \nFor example: \"Can we change gears for a minute? I'd like to talk \nabout what happens when we're not romantically in sync. It would \nbe good if we could both share what's working and what isn't. My \ngoal isn't to make you feel guilty, and I certainly don't want to \nbecome defensive. What I'd really love is for us to come up with a \nsolution that makes us both satisfied in our relationship.\" \nNOTICE WHICH CONDI TION IS AT RISK \nNow, let's look at a couple of pieces that help us establish safety­\neven when the topic is high risk, controversial, and emotional. The \nfirst step to building more safety is to understand which of the two \nconditions of safety is at risk. Each requires a different solution. \nMut ual Purpose \nWhy Ta lk in the Fi rst Place? \nRemember the last time someone gave you difficult feedback and \nyou didn't become defensive? Say a friend said some things to \nyou that most people might get upset over. In order for this per­\nson to be able to deliver the delicate message, you must have \nbelieved he or she cared about you, or about your goals and \nobjectiv es. That means you trusted his or her purposes so you \nwere willing to listen to some pretty tough feedback. \nCrucial conversations often go awry not because of the con­\ntent of the conversation, but because others believe that the"

Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. \nConsequent ly, the first condition of safety is Mutual Purpose. \nMutual Purpose means that others perceive that we are working \ntoward a common outcome in the conver sation, that we care \nabout their goals, interests, and valu es. And vice versa. We \nbelieve they care about ours . Consequ ently, Mutual Purpose is \nthe entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal and you have \nboth a good reason and a healthy climate for talking. \nFor example, if Jotham believes that Yvonne's purpose in rais­\ning this topic is to make him feel guilty or to get her way, this \nconversation is doomed from the outset. If he believes she really \ncares about making things better for him and herself, she may \nhave a chance. \nWatch for signs that Mutual Pur pose is at risk. How do we \nknow when the safety problem we're seeing is due to a lack of \nMutual Purpose? It's actually fairly easy to spot. First and fore­\nmost, when purpose is at risk, we end up in debate. When others \nstart forcing their opinions into the pool of meaning, it's often \nbecause they figure that we're trying to win and they need to do \nthe same. Other signs that purpose is at risk include defensiveness, \nhidden agendas (the silence form of fouled-up purpose), accusa­\ntions, and circling back to the same topic. Here are some crucial \nquestions to help us determine when Mutual Purpose is at risk: \n• Do others believe I care about their goals in this conv ersation? \n• Do they trust my motives? \nRemember the Mutual in Mutual Purpose. Just a word to the \nwise. Mutual Purpose is not a technique. To succeed in crucial \nconv ersations, we must really care about the interests of others­\nnot ju st our own. The purpose has to be truly mutual . If our goal"

Before you begin, examine your motive s. \nAsk yourself the Start with Heart questions: \n• What do I want for me? \n• What do I want for others? \n• What do I want for the relationship? \nLook for the mutualit y. Let's see how Mutual Purpose applies \nto a tough example-one where, at first glance, it might appear \nas if your purpose is to make things better for yourself. How can \nyou find Mutual Pur pose in this? Let's say you've got a boss who \nfrequently fails to keep commitme nts. How could you tell the \nboss you don't trust him? Surely there's no way to say this with­\nout the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because he knows \nthat your goal is merely to make your life better. \nTo avoid disaster, find a Mutual Purpose that would be so \nmotivating to the boss that he'd want to hear your concerns. If \nyour only reason for approaching the boss is to get what you \nwant, the boss will hear you as critical and selfish-which is what \nyou are. On the other hand, if you try to see the other person's \npoint of view, you can often find a way to draw the other person \nwillingly into even very sensitive conversations. For example, if \nthe boss's behavior is causing you to miss deadlines he cares \nabout, or incur costs he frets over, or lose productivity that he \nworries about, then you're onto a possible Mutual Purpose. \nImagine raising the topic this way: \"I've got some ideas for \nhow I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few \nthousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It's going \nto be a bit of a sensitive conversation-but I think it will help a \ngreat deal if we can talk about it .\"\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 71 \nMut ual Respect \nWill We Be Able to Remain in Dialogue? \nWhile it's true that there's no reason to enter a crucial conversaM \ntion if you don't have Mutual Purpose, it's equally true that you \ncan't stay in the conversation if you don't maintain Mutual \nRespect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dia­\nlogue. As people perceive that others don't respect them, the \nconversation immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to \na screeching halt. \nWhy? Because respect is like air. If you take it away, it's all \npeople can think about. The instant people perceive disrespect \nin a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the origi· \nnal purpose-it is now about defending digni ty. \nFor example, you're talking with a group of supervisors \nabout a complicated quality problem. You really want to see \nthe problem res olved once and for all. Your job depends on it. \nUnfortunately, you also think the supervisors are overpaid and \nunderqualified. You firmly believe that not only are they in \nover their heads, but they do stu pid things all the time. Some \nof them even act unethically. \nAs the supervisors throw out ideas, you roll your eyes. The dis .. \nrespect you carry in your head creeps out in one unfortunate ges· \nture. And it's all over. What happens to the conversation despite \nthe fact that you still share a common objective? It tanks. They \ntake shots at your proposals. You add insulting adjectives in \ndescribing theirs. As attention turns to scoring points, everyone \nloses. Your Mutual Purpose suffers for a lack of Mutual Respect . \nTellta le signs. To spot when respect is violated and safety takes \na turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dig­\nnity. Emotions are the key. When people feel disrespected, they \nbecome highly charged. Their emotions tum from fear to anger."

Ask the following question to determine when Mutual \nRespect is at risk: \n• Do others believe I respect them? \nCa n You Respec t Peo ple You Don' t Respec t? \nSome people fear they'll never be able to maintain Mutual \nPurpose or Mutual Respect with certain individuals or in certain \ncircumstance s. How, they wonder, can they share the same pur­\npose with people who come from completely different back­\ngrounds or whose morals or values differ from theirs? What do \nyou do, for example, if you're upset because another person has \nlet you down? And if this has repeatedly happened, how can you \nrespect a person who is so poorly motivated and selfish? \nYvonne is struggling with this exact point. There are times \nwhen she doesn't even like Jotham. She sees him as whiny and self­\ncentered. How can you speak respectfully with someone like that? \nDialogue truly would be doomed if we had to share every \nobjective or respect every element of another person's character \nbefore we could talk. If this were the case, we'd all be mute. We \ncan, however, stay in dialogue by finding a way to honor and \nregard another person's basic humanity. In essence, feelings of \ndisrespect often come when we dwell on how others are differ­\nent from ourselves. We can counteract these feelings by looking \nfor ways we are similar. Without excusing their behavior, we try \nto sympathize, even empathize, with them. \nA rather clever person once hinted how to do this in the form \nof a prayer-\"Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently \nthan I.\" When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it's eas­\nier to find a way to respect others. When we do this, we feel a \nkinship, a sense of mutuality between ourselves and even the \nthorniest of people. It is this sense of kinship and connection to\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 73 \nothers that motivates us to enter tough conversations, and it \neventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone. \nConsider the following example. A manufacturing company has \nbeen out on strike for over six months. Finally, the union agrees to \nreturn to work, but the represented employees have to sign a con­\ntract that is actually worse than what they were originally demand­\ning. The first day back it's clear that although people will work, \nthey won't do so with a smile and a spring in their step. Everyone \nis furious. How are people ever going to move ahead? \nConcerned that although the strike is over, the battle isn't, a \nmanager asks one of the authors to lend a hand. So he meets with \nthe two groups of leaders (both managers and union heads) and \nasks them to do one thing. Each group is to go into a separate \nroom and write out its goals for the company on flip-chart-sized \npaper. For two hours each group feverishly lays out what it wants \nin the future and then tapes the lists to the wall. When they fin­\nish their assignment, the groups then swap places with the goal of \nfinding anything-maybe just a morsel-but anything they might \nhave in common. \nAfter a few minutes the two groups return to the training \nroom. They're positively stunned. It was as if they had written \nthe exact same lists. They didn't merely share the shadow of an \nidea or two. Their aspirations were nearly identical. All wanted \na profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality \nproducts, and a positive impact on the communi ty. Given a \nchance to speak freely and without fear of attack, each group \nlaid out not simply what it wanted, but what virtually every per­\nson wanted. \nThis experience caused each group to seriously question how \nit had seen the other side. The groups began to see others as \nmorc simi lar to themselves. They realized the petty and political \ntactics thc others had used were embarrassin gly similar to the\n\f\n74 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nones they themselves had employed. The \"sins\" of others were \ndifferent from their own more because of the role they played \nthan because of a fundamental blight on their character. They \nrestored Mutual Respect, and dialogue replaced silence and vio­\nlence for the first time in decades . \nWHAT TO DO ONC E YOU STEP OUT \nWhen you see that either Mutual Respect or Purpose is at risk, \nwe've suggested that you shouldn't ignore it. We've also argued \nthat you should be able to find a way to both find Mutual \nPurpose and enjoy Mutual Respect -even with people who are \nenormously different. \nBut how? What are you supposed to actually do? We've \nshared a few modest ideas (mostly things to avoid) , so let's get \ninto three hard-hitting skills that the best at dialogue use: \n• Apologize \n• Contrast \n• CRIB \nEach skill helps rebuild either Mutual Respect or Mutual \nPurpose. First, we'll study them in action. Then, we'll see if they \nmight help Yvonne get things back on track. \nWhere were you ? You're talking with a group of hourly em­\nployees who worked all night preparing for a factory tour. You \nwere supposed to bring the divisio n vice president by, and the \nteam members were then going to update him on a new process \nthey've put into place. They're proud of some improvements \nthey've recently made-enoug h so that they willingly worked \nstraight through the night to finish the last details. \nUnfortunately, when it came time to swing by their area, the \nvisiting VP dropped a bomb. He laid out a plan you're convinced\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 75 \nwould hurt quality and potentially drive away your biggest cus­\ntomers. Since you only had another hour with the VP, you chose \nto talk through the issue rather than conduct the tour. Your \nfuture depended on that particular conversation. Fortunately, \nyou were able to avert the plan. Unfortunately, you forgot to get \nword to the team that had worked so hard. \nAs you walked back to your office after escorting the execu­\ntive to his car, you bumped into the team. Bleary-eyed and disap­\npointed, all six of them were now fuming. No visit, no phone \ncall, and now it was clear from the way you were sprinting on by \nthat you weren't even going to stop and give them a simple expla­\nnation. \nOuch. \nThat's when things started turning ugly. \"We pulled an all­\nnighter, and you didn't even bother to come by! That's the last \ntime we're busting our hump for you!\" \nTime stands still. This con versation has just turned crucial. \nThe employees who had worked so hard are obviously upset. \nThey feel disrespected. \nBut you miss that point. Why? Because now you feel disre­\nspected. They've attacked you. So you stay stuck in the content \nof the conversation-thinking this has something to do with the \nfactory tour. \n\"I had to choose between the future of the company and the \nplant tour. 1 chose our future, and I'd do it again if 1 had to. \" \nNow both you and they are fighting for respect. This is getting \nyou nowhere fast. But what else could you do? \nInstead of getting hooked and fighting back, break the cycle. \nSec their aggressive behavior for what it is-a sign of violated \nsa rety-then step out of the conversation, build safety, and step \nback into the content. Here's how."

An apology is a statement \nthat sincerely expresses your sorrow for your role in causing-or \nat least not preventing-pain or difficulty to others. \n''I'm sorry I didn't give you a call when I learned that we \nwouldn't be coming by. You worked all night, it would have \nbeen a wonderful chance to showcase your improvements, \nand I didn't even explain what happened. I apologize.\" \nNow, an apology isn't really an apology unless you experience a \nchange in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to \nchange. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning \nin order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a \nbit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, \nwhen you give up something you value, you're rewarded with \nsomething even more valuable-healthy dialogue and better \nresults.

You can start by \ninnocently sharing your views, but the other person believes your \nintention is to beat him or her up or coerce him or her into accept­\ning your opinion.

Ho w, then, can you rebuild Mutual Purpose or \nMutual Respect in order to make it safe to get back to dialogue? \nWhen others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, \nstep out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called \nCont rasting. \nContrasting is a don'tldo statement that: \n• Addresses others' concerns that you don't respect them or that \nyou have a malicious purpose (the don 't part) . \n• Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do \npart). \nFor example: \n[The don't part] \"The last thing I wanted to do was com­\nmunicate that I don't value the work you put in or that I \ndidn't want to share it with the VP. \n[The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of \nspectacular. \" \nNow that you've addressed the threat to safety, you can return \nto the issue of the visit itself and move to remedi ation: \n\"U nfortunately, just when I was starting to make the trip out \nhere, an issue came up with the VP that I needed to address \nright then and there, or it could have cost us a huge piece of \nour business. I tell you what-I'll see if I can get him down \nhere sometime tomorrow to review your work. He'll be here \nfor the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Let's see if we can show off \nth e process impl'Ovcments you came up with.\"\n\f\n78 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nOf the two parts of Contrasting, the don 't is the more \nimportant because it deals with the misund erstanding that has \nput safety at risk. The employees who worked so hard are act­\ning on the belief that you don't appreciate thejr efforts and \ndidn't care enough to keep them inform ed-when the opposite \nwas true. So you address the misunderstanding by explaining \nwhat you don't intend. Once you've done this, and safety \nreturns to the conversation, then you can explain what you do \nintend. Safety first. \nLet's go back to Yvonne and Jotham. Yvonne is trying to get \nthe conversation going, and Jotham suspects her motives. Let's \nsee how Contrasting might help her. \nYVONNE: I think it makes things worse when you withdraw \nand won't talk to me for days at a time. \nJOTHAM: SO you expect me not only to put up with regular \nrejection, but also to be sociable and happy when I do? \nJotham appears to believe that Yvonne's motive is to reshape him. \nIt's unsafe. Mutual Purpose is at risk. Rather than responding to \nhis sarcasm, she should step out of the content and clarify her real \nmotives. \nYVONNE: I don't want to suggest that this problem is yours. \nThe truth is, I think it's ours. I'm not trying to put the \nburden on you. I don't even know what the solution is. \nWhat I do want is to be able to talk so that we can under­\nstand each other better. Perhaps that will help me change \nhow I'm responding to you, too. \nlaTHAM: I know where this is going. We talk, I continue to \nget rejected, but you get to feel good about yourself \nbecause \"we've communica ted.\" Have you been watching \nOprah again?\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 79 \nObviously Jotham still believes that Yvonne merely wants to con­\nfirm that their existing relationship is okay and if she does, she'll \nbe able to continue to reject Jotham-but feel good about it. \nlotham still feels unsafe. So Yvonne continues to step out and \nbuild safety, using Contrasting. \nYVONNE: Seriously, Honey. I'm not interested in discussing \nwhy our current relationship is really okay. I can see that \nit isn't. I merely want to talk about what each of us likes \nand doesn't like. That way we'll be able to see what we \nneed to improve and why. My only goal is to come up \nwith some ideas that will make both of us happy. \nJOTHAM: (Changing tone and demeanor) Really? I'm sorry \nto be so insecure about this. I know I'm being a bit selfish \nabout things, but I don't know how to make myself feel \ndifferently. \nCont rasting is not apologizing. It's important to understand \nthat Contrasting is not apologizing. It is not a way of taking back \nsomething we've said that hurt others' feelings. Rather, it is a \nway of ensuring what we said didn't hurt more than it should \nhave. Once Yvonne clarified her genuine goals (and not merely \nsome trumped-up goal that appeals to lotham), lotham felt safer \nacknowledging his own contribution, and the two were back in \ndialogue. \nCont rasting provides context and proportion. When we're in \nthe middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others hear what \nwe're saying as bigger or worse than we intend. For example, you \ntalk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality. When you \nshare your concern, he appears crushed. \nAt this point you could be tempted to water down your con­\nlent-\"You know it's really not that big a deal.\" Don't do it. \nDon't take back what you've said. Instead, put it in context. For\n\f\n80 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \ninstance, at this point your assista nt may believe you are com­\npletely dissatisf ied with his performance. He believes that your \nview of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect \nfor him. If this belief is incorrect, use Contrasting to clarify \nwhat you don't and do believe. Start with what you don't \nbelieve. \n\"Let me put this in perspective. I don't want you to think \nI'm not satisfied with the quality of your work. I want us to \ncontinue working together. I really do think you're doing a \ngood job. This punctuality issue is important to me, and I'd \njust like you to work on that. If you will be more attentive \nto that, there are no other issues .\" \nUse Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting is use­\nful both as a prevention and as first aid for safety problems. So \nfar our examples have been of the first-a id type. Someone has \ntaken something wrong, and we've intervened to clarify our true \npurpose or meaning. \nWhen we're aware that something we're about to drop into \nthe pool of meaning could create a splash of defensiveness, we \nuse Contrasting to bolster safety-even before we see others \ngoing to either silence or violence. \n\"I don't want you to think that I don't appreciate the time \nyou've taken to keep our checkbook balanced and up to \ndate. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldn't have \ndone nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns \nwith how we're using the new electronic banking system.\" \nWhen people misunderstand and you start arguing over the \nmisunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you \ndon't mean until you've restored safety. Then return to the \nconversation. Safety first.\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 81 \nYou Try \nLet's practice. Read the situations below and then come up with \nyour own Contrasting statements. Remember, contrast what you \ndon't want or intend with what you actually do want or intend. \nSay it in a way that helps make it safe for the other person. \nAngry roommate. You asked your roommate to move her \nthings in the refrigerator off your shelves and onto her shelves. \nYou thought it was no big deal, simply a request to share the \nspace evenly. You have no hidden agenda. You like this roommate \na great deal. She came back with: \"There you go again, telling me \nhow to run my life. I can't change the vacuum cleaner bag with­\nout you jumping in and giving me advice.\" \nFormulate a Contrasting statement. \nI don't want __________________ _ \nI do want ___________________ _ \nTouchy employee. You're about to talk to Jacob, an employee \nwho continually blows up when people try to give him feedback. \nYesterday a coworker told Jacob that she'd prefer it if he would \nclean up after himself in the lunchroom (something that every­\none else does), and Jacob blew up. You've decided to say some­\nthing. Of course, you'll be giving him feedback, and that's what \nusually sets him off, so you'll need to be careful up front. You'll \nwant to set the right tone and lay out the context carefully. After \nall, you like Jacob a lot. Everyone does. He has a great sense of \nhumor and is the most competent and hard-working employee \naround. If he could only be less touchy. \nFormulat e a Contrasting statement. \nI don't want __________________ _ \nI do want\n\f\n82 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nChatty teenager. Your teenage nephew moved in with you \nwhen his father (your brother) passed away and your sister-in­\nlaw could no longer handle him. He was starting to hang with \nthe wrong crowd. He has always gotten along with you, and \nthings have been going well except in one area: He spends hours \non the phone and Internet-most of his waking hours. In light of \nwhat he could be doing, you're not really dis turbed, but it has \nbeen hard for you to make calls and check your email. You said \nsomething to him about cutting back his time on the phone and \nonline, and he came back with: \"Please don't send me to a youth \nhome! I'll be good! I promi se. I'll stop talking to my friends; just \ndon't send me away.\" \nFormulate a contrasting statement. \nI don't want. ___________________ _ \nI do want ___________________ _ \nCRIB TO GET TO MUTUAL PURPOSE \nLet's add one more skill. Sometimes we find ourselves in the \nmiddle of a debate because we clearly have different purposes. \nThere is no misunderstanding here. Contrasting won't do the \ntrick. We need something sturdier for this job. \nFor instance, you've just been offered a promotion that will \nhelp propel your career along a faster track and bring you a great \ndeal more authority, and it pays enough to help soften the blow \nof displacement. That last part is important because you'll have \nto move the family across the country and your spouse and kids \nlove where you currently live. \nYou expected your spouse to have feelings of ambivalence \nover the move, but he or she doesn't seem to be bivaling even a \ntiny bit. To your spouse the promotion is a bad news/bad news \nevent. First, you have to move, and second, you'll work even\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 83 \nlonger hours . That whole thing about more money and power \ndoesn't seem to be compensating. Now what? \nThe worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push \nahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for \neither competition or submission. Both strategies end up making \nwinners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the \ninitial conversation. \nThe good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. \nFor example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two house­\nholds-one where one spouse will be working and one where \nthe family currently lives . Nobody really wants this arrangement, \nand frankly, it's a pretty ugly solution that's bound to lead to \nmore serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is \nsometimes necessary, the best know better than to start there. \nThe best at dialogue use four skills to look for a Mutual Purpose. \nThe four skills they use form the acronym CRIB . \n.commi t to Seek Mutual Purpose \nAs is true with most dialogue skill s, if you want to get back to dia­\nlogue, you have to Start with Heart. In this case, you have to agree \nto agree. To be successful, we have to stop using silence or vio­\nlence to compel others to our view. We must even surrender false \ndialogue, where we pretend to have Mutual Purpose (calmly argu­\ning our side until the other person gives in) . We Start with Heart \nby committing to stay in the conversation until we come up with \na solution that serves a purpose we both share. \nThis can be tough. To stop arguing, we have to suspend our \nbeli ef that our choice is the absolute best and only one, and that \nwe'll never be happy until we get exactly what we currently \nwant. We have to open our mind to the fact that maybe, just \nmaybe, there is a different choice out there-one that suits \neveryone.\n\f\n84 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nWe also have to be willing to verbalize this commitment even \nwhen our partner seems committed to winning. We act on faith \nthat our partner is stuck in silence or violence because he or she \nfeels unsafe. We assume that if we build more safety-by \ndemonstrating our commitment to finding a Mutual Purpose­\nthe other person will feel more confident that dialogue could be \na productive avenue. \nSo next time you find yourself stuck in a battle of wills, try this \namazingly powerful but simple skill. Step out of the content of \nthe struggle and make it safe. Simply say, \"It seems like we're \nboth trying to force our view. I commit to stay in this discussion \nuntil we have a solution both of us are happy with.\" Then watch \nwhether safety takes a turn for the better . \n.Recogni ze the Purpose be hind the Strategy \nWanting to come up with a shared goal is a wonderful first step, \nbut it's not enough. Once we've had a change of heart, we need \nto change our strategy. Here's the problem we have to fix: When \nwe find ourselves at an impas se, it's because we're asking for one \nthing and the other person is asking for something else. We think \nwe'll never find a way out because we equate what we're asking \nfor with what we want. In truth, what we're asking for is the \nstrategy we're suggesting to get what we want. We confuse wants \nor purpose with strategies. That's the problem. \nFor example, I come home from work and say that I want to \ngo to a movie. You say that you want to stay home and relax. \nAnd so we debate: movie, TV, movie, read, etc. We figure we'll \nnever be able to resolve our differences because going out and \nstaying home are incompatible. \nIn such circumstances we can break the impas se by asking \nothers, \"Why do you want that?\" In this case,\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 85 \n\"Why do you want to stay home?\" \n\"Because I'm tired of running around and dealing with the \nhassle of the city.\" \n\"So you want peace and qui et?\" \n\"Mostl y. And why do you want to go to a movie?\" \n\"So I can spend some time with you away from the kids .\" \nBefore you can agree on a Mutual Purpose, you must know \nwhat people's real purposes are. So step out of the content of the \nconversatio n-which is generally focused on strategies-a nd \nexplore the purposes behind them. \nWhen you do this, new options become possible. When you \nrelease your grip on your strategy and focus on your real pur­\npose, you open up the possibility of finding new alternatives that \ncan serve Mutual Purpose. \n\"You want peace and quiet, and I want time with you away \nfrom the kids . So if we can come up with something that is \nquiet and away, we'll both be happy. Is that right?\" \n\"Absolu tely. What if we were to take a drive up the \ncanyon and ... \" \nInvent a Mutual Purpose \nSometimes when we recognize the purposes behind our strategies, \nwe discover that we actually have compatible goals. From there \nyou simply come up with common strategies. But we're not always \nso lucky. For example, you find out that your genuine wants and \ngoals cannot be served except at the expense of the other person's. \nIn this case you cannot discover a Mutual Purpose, so you must \nactively invent one. \nTo invent a Mutual Purpose, move to more encompassing goals. \nFind an objective that is more meaningful or more rewarding than\n\f\n86 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthe ones that divide the various sides . For instance, you and your \nspouse may not agree on whether or not you should take the pro­\nmotion, but you can agree that the needs of your relationship \nand the children come before career aspiratio ns. By focusing on \nhigher and longer-term goals, you can find a way to transcend \nshort-term compromises, build Mutual Purpose, and get to dia­\nlogue. \nIlrains torm New Strateg ies \nOnce you've built safety by finding a shared purpose, you should \nnow have enough safety to return to the content of the conver­\nsation. It's time to step back into the dialogue and brainstorm \nstrategies that meet everyone's needs. If you've committed to \nfinding something everyone can agree on, and surfaced what you \nreally want, you'll no longer be spending your energy on unpro­\nductive conflict. Instead, you'll be actively coming up with \noptions that can serve everyone. \nSuspend judgment and think outside the box for new alterna­\ntives . Can you find a way to work in a job that is local and still \nmeets your career goals? Is this job with this company the only \nthing that will make you happy? Is a move really necessary in \nthis new job? Is there another community that could offer your \nfamily the same benefits? If you're not willing to give creativity \na try, it'll be impossible for you to jointly come up with a mutu­\nally acceptable option. If you are, the sky's the limit. \nCRIB to Get to Mutual Purpose \nSo when you sense that you and others are working at cross­\npurposes, here's what you can do. First, step out of the content \nof the conflict. Stop focusing on who thinks what. Then CRIB \nyour way to Mutual Purpose.\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 87 \n• Qommit to seek Mutual Purpose. Make a unilateral public \ncommitment to stay in the conversation until you come up \nwith something that serves everyone. \n\"This isn 't working. Your team is arguing to stay late and \nwork until we're done, and my team wants to go home and \ncome back on the weekend. Why don't we see if we can come \nup with something that satisfies everyone?\" \n• Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Ask people why \nthey want what they're pushing for. Separate what they're \ndemanding from the purpose it serves. \n\"Exactly why don 't you want to come in Saturday morning? \nWe're feeling fatigued and are worried about safety issues and \na loss of qual ity. Why do you want to stay late? \" \n• Invent a Mutual Purpose. If after clarifying everyone's pur­\nposes you are still at odds, see if you can invent a higher or \nlonger-term purpose that is more motivating than the ones \nthat keep you in conflict. \n\"I certainly don 't want to make winn ers and losers here. It's \nfar better if we can come up with something that doesn 't make \none team resent the other one. We've voted before or flipped a \ncoin, and the losers just ended up resenting the winne rs. I'm \nmore worried about how we feel about each other than any­\nthing else. Let's make sure that whatever we do, we don't \ndrive a wedge in our working relationship. \" \n• B.rainstorm new strategies. With a clear Mutual Purpose, you \ncan join forces in searching for a solution that serves everyone. \n\"So we need to come up with something that doesn't jeopard­\nize safety and quality and allows your team to attend their col­\nleague's wedding on Saturday. My team members don't care \nabuut the game a bit. What if we were to work the morning and\n\f\n88 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nearly afternoon, and then you come in after the game and take \nover from there? That way we'll be able ... \" \nBACK TO YVO NNE AND JOTHAM \nLet's end where we started. Yvonne is going to try to move to \ndialogue with Jotham. Let's see how she does at making it safe in \nher crucial conversation. First, she'll use Contrasting to prevent \nmisunderstanding of her purpose. \nYVONNE: Jotham, I'd like to talk about our physical relation­\nship. I'm not doing it to put you on the spot or to suggest \nthe problem is yours. I'm completely clear that it's as \nmuch my problem as yours. I'd really like to talk about \nit so we can make things better for both of us. \nJOTHAM: What's there to talk about? You don't want it. I \nwant it. I'll try to deal with it. \nYVONNE: I think it's more complicated than that. The way \nyou act sometimes makes me want to be with you even less. \nJOTHAM: If that's how you feel, why are we pretending we \nhave a relationship at all? \nOk ay, what just happened? Remember, we're exploring \nYvonne's side of the con versation. She's the one initiating the \ntalk. Clearly there's a lot Jotham could be doing to make things go \nbetter. But she's not Jotham. What should Yvonne do? She should \nfocus on what she really wants: to find a way to make things bet­\nter for both of them. Consequently, she shouldn't respond to the \ncontent of Jotham's discouraging statement. Rather, she should \nlook at the safety issue behind it. Why is Jotham starting to with­\ndraw from the conversation? Two reasons: \n• The way Yvonne made her point sounded to him like she was \nblaming him for everything.\n\f\nMAKE IT SAFE 89 \n• He believes her concern in one small area reflects her total \nfeelings toward him. \nSo she'll apologize and use Contrasting to rebuild safety. \nYVONNE: I'm sorry I said it that way. I'm not blaming you \nfor how I feel or act. That's my problem. I don't see this \nas your problem. I see it as our problem. Both of us may \nbe acting in ways that make things worse. I know I am at \nleast. \nlaTHAM: I probably am too. Sometimes I pout because I'm \nhurting. And I also do it hoping it'll make you feel bad. \nI'm sorry about that, too. \nNotice what just happened. Since Yvonne dealt well with the \nsafety issue and kept focused on what she really wanted out of \nthis conversation, Jotham returned to the conversation. This is \nfar more effective than if Yvonne had gone into blaming. \nLet's continue. \nJOTHAM: I ju st don't see how we can work this out. I'm \nwired for more passion than you are-it seems like the \nonly solution is for me to put up with it the way it is or \nfor you to feel like a sex slave. \nThe problem now is one of Mutual Purpose. Jotham thinks he \nand Yvonne are at cross-pur poses. In his mind, there is no pos­\nsib ility of a mutually sati sfactory solution. Rather than move to \ncompromise or fight for her way, Yvonne will step out of the \nissue and CRIB to get to Mutual Purpose. \nYVONNE: [Commit to seek Mutual Purpose] No, that isn't \nwhat I want at all. I don't want anything with you that \nisn't great for both of us. I ju st want to find a way to have \nus both feel close. appreciated. and loved.\n\f\n90 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nlaTHAM: That's what I want, too. It just seems like we get \nthose feelings in different ways . \n(Notice how lotham is leaving the game behind and joining \nthe dialogue. Safety-specifically Mutual Purpose-is making \nthis possible .) \nYVONNE: [Recognize the purpose behind the strategy] Maybe \nnot. What makes you feel loved and appreciated? \nlaTHAM: Making love with you when you really want to \nmakes me feel loved and appreci ated. And you? \nYVONNE: When you do thoughtful things for me. And, I \nguess, when you hold me-but not always sexually . \nlaTHAM: You mean, if we're just cuddling that makes you \nfeel loved? \nYVONNE: Yes. And sometimes-I guess when I think \nyou're doing it because you love me-sex does that for \nme, too. \nJOTHAM: [Invent a Mutual Purpose] So we need to find \nways to be together that make both of us feel loved and \nappreciated. Is that what we're looking for here? \nYVONNE: Yes. I really want that, too. \nlaTHAM: [Brainstorm new strategies] Well, what if we ... \nBUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT! \nReading a complicated interaction like this one might lead to two \nreactions. First, you might think, \"Wow, these ideas could actu­\nally work!\" And at the same time, you could be thinking, \"But \nthere's no way I could think that clearly in the middle of that \nkind of delicate conversation !\""

But the good \nnews is, that's not where these examples came from. They came \nfrom real experiences. People do act like this all the time. In fact, \nyou do on your best days. \nSo don't overwhelm yourself by asking whether you could \nthink this clearly during every heated and emotional conver­\nsation. Merely consider whether you could think a little more \nclearly during a few crucial conversations. Or prepare in advance. \nBe fore a crucial conversation begins, think about which skills will \nhelp you most. Remember, when it comes to these high-stakes \nconversations, a little progress can produce a lot of benefit. \nFinally , as is the case with most complicated problems, don't \naim for perfection. Aim for progress. Learn to slow the process \ndown when your adrenaline gets pumping. Carry a few of the \nquestions we're suggesting with you as you go. Pick the ones that \nyou think are most relevant to the topic at hand. And watch \nyourself get better a little at a time. \nSUM MARY- MAKE IT SAFE \nStep Out \nWhen others move to silence or violence, step out of the con­\nversation and Make It Safe. When safety is restored, go back to \nthe issue at hand and continue the dialogue. \nDecide Which Condition of Safety Is at Risk \n• Mutual Purpose. Do others believe you care about their goals \nin this conversation? Do they trust your motives? \n• Mutual Respect. Do others believe you respect them?\n\f\n92 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nApologize When Appropri ate \n• When you've clearly violated respect, apologize . \nContrast to Fix Misunder sta ndin g \n• When others misundersta nd either your purpose or your \nintent, use Contrasting.

Then explain what you do intend or mean. \nCRIB to Get to Mut ual Purpose \n• When you are at cross -purposes, use four skills to get back to \nMutual Purpose: \n• .commit to seek Mutual Purpos e. \n• Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. \n• Invent a Mutual Purpose. \n• B.rainstorm new strategies.\n\f\nIt's not how you play the game, \nit's how the game plays you. \nMaster My Stories \nHow to Stay in Dialogue When \nYou're Angr}'t Scared, or Hurt \nAt this point you may be saying to yourself, \"How am I supposed \nto remember to do all this stuff-esp ecially when my emotions \nare raging like hot magma?\" \nThis chapter explores how to gain control of crucial conver­\nsations by learning how to take charge of your emotions. By \nlearning to exert influence over your own feelings, you'll place \nyourself in a far better position to use all the tools we've \nexplored thus far. \nHE MADE ME MAD ! \nHow many times have you heard someone say: \"He made me \nmad!\" ,? How many times have you said it? For instance, you're\n\f\n94 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nsitting quietly at home watching TV and your mother-in-law (who \nlives with you) walks in. She glances around and then starts pick­\ning up the mess you made a few minutes earlier when you \nwhipped up a batch of nachos. This ticks you off. She's always \nsmugly skulking around the house, thinking you're a slob. \nA few minutes later when your spouse asks you why you're so \nupset, you explain, \"It's your mom again . I was lying here enjoy­\ning myself when she gave me that look, and it really got me \ngoing. To be honest, I wish she would quit doing that. It' s my \nonly day off, I'm relaxing quiet ly, and then she walks in and \npushes my buttons.\" \n\"Does she push your buttons?\" your spouse asks. \"Or do \nyou?\" \nThat's an interesting question. \nOne thing's for certain. No matter who is doing the button \npushing, some people tend to react more explosively than others­\nand to the same stimulus, no less. Why is that? For instance, what \nenables some people to listen to withering feedback without flin­\nching, whereas others pitch a fit when you tell them they've got a \nsmear of salsa on their chin? Why is it that sometimes you your­\nself can take a verbal blow to the gut without batting an eye, but \nother times you go ballistic if someone so much as looks at you \nsideways? \nEMOTIONS DON' T JUST HAPPEN \nTo answer these questions, we'll start with two rather bold (and \nsometimes unpopular) claims. Then, having tipped our hand, we'll \nexplain the logic behind each claim. \nClaim One. Emotions don't settle upon you like a fog. They \nare not foisted upon you by others . No matter how comfortable \nit might make you feel saying it-others don't make you mad. \nYou make you mad. You and only you create your emotions.\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 95 \nClaim Two. Once you've created your emotions, you have only \ntwo options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That \nis, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to \nmaster them or fall hostage to them. \nHere's how this all unfolds. \nMARIA'S STORY \nConsider Maria, a copywriter who is currently hostage to some \npretty strong emotions. She and her colleague Louis just \nreviewed the latest draft of a proposal with their boss. During \nthe meeting, they were supposed to be jointly presenting their \nlatest ideas. But when Maria paused to take a breath, Louis took \nover the presentation, making almost all the points they had \ncome up with together. When the boss turned to Maria for input, \nthere was nothing left for her to say. \nMaria has been feeling humiliated and angry throughout this \nproject. First, Louis took their suggestions to the boss and dis­\ncussed them behind her back. Second, he completely monopo­\nlized the presentation. Consequentl y, Maria believes that Louis is \ndownplaying her contribution because she's the only woman on \nthe team. \nShe's getting fed up with his \"boys' club\" mentality. So what \ndoes she do? She doesn't want to appear \"oversensitive ,\" so most \nof the time she says nothing and just does her job. However, she \ndoes manage to assert herself by occasionally getting in sarcastic \njabs about the way she's being treated. \n\"Sure I can get that printout for you. Should I just get your \ncoffee and whip up a bundt cake while I'm at it?\" she mutters, \nand rolls her eyes as she exits the room. \nLouis, in tum, finds Maria's cheap shots and sarcasm puz­\nzling. He's not sure what has Maria upset but is beginning to \ndespis e her smug attitude and hostile reaction to most everything\n\f\n96 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nhe does. As a result, when the two work together, you could cut \nthe tension with a knife. \nWhat's Making Maria Mad? \nThe worst at dialogue fall into the trap Maria has fallen into. \nMaria is completely unaware of a dangerous assumption she's \nmaking. She's upset at being overlooked and is keeping a pro­\nfessional silence. She's assuming that her emotions and behavior \nare the only right and reasonable reactions under the circum­\nstances. She's convinced that anyone in her place would feel the \nsame way. \nHere's the problem. Maria is treating her emotions as if they are \nthe only valid response. Since, in her mind, they are both justified \nand accurate, she makes no effort to change or even question \nthem. In fact, in her view, Louis caused them. Ultimately, her \nactions (saying nothing and taking cheap shots) are being driven \nby these very emotions. Since she's not acting on her emotions, her \nemotions are acting on her-controlling her behavior and driving \nher deteriorating relationship with Louis. The worst at dialogue \nare hostages to their emotions, and they don't even know it. \nThe good at dialogue realize that if they don't control their \nemotions, matters will get worse. So they try something else. \nThey fake it. They choke down reactions and then do their best \nto get back to dialogue. At least, they give it a shot. \nUnfortunately, once they hit a rough spot in a crucial conver­\nsation, their suppressed emotions come out of hiding. They show \nup as tightened jaws or sarcastic comments. Dialogue takes a hit. \nOr maybe their paralyzing fear causes them to avoid saying what \nthey really think. Meaning is cut off at the source. In any case, \ntheir emotions sneak out of the cubbyhole they've been crammed \ninto and find a way into the conversation. It's never pretty, and \nit always kills dialogue.\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 97 \nThe best at dialogue do something completely different. They \naren't held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or \nsuppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when \nthey have strong feelings, they influence (and often change) their \nemotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their \nemotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors \nthat create better results. \nThis, of course, is easier said than done. How do you rethink \nyourself from an emotional and dangerous state into one that \nputs you back in control? \nWhere should Maria start? To help rethink or gain control of \nour emotions, let's see where our feelings come from in the first \nplace. Let's look at a model that helps us first examine and then \ngain control of our own emotions. \nConsider Maria. She's feeling hurt but is worried that if she \nsays something to Louis, she'll look too emotional, so she alter­\nnates between holding her feelings inside (avoiding) and taking \ncheap shots (maskin g). \nAs Figure 6-1 demonstrates, Maria's actions stem from her feel­\nings. First she feels and then she acts. That's easy enough, but it \nFeel --...... Act \nhurt sil ence \nworried cheap \nshots \nFigure 6-1. How Feelings Drive Actions\n\f\n98 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nbegs the question: What's causing Maria's feelings in the first \nplace? \nIs it Louis's behavior? As was the case with the nacho-mother­\nin-l aw, did Louis make Maria feel insulted and hurt? Maria \nheard and saw Louis do something, she generated an emotion, \nand then she acted out her feelings-using forms of masking and \navoiding. \nSo here's the big question: What happens between Louis act­\ning and Maria feeling? Is there an intermediate step that turns \nsomeone else's actions into our feelings? If not, then it has to be \ntrue that others make us feel the way we do. \nSto ries Create Feelings \nAs it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what oth­\ners do and how we feel. That's why, when faced with the same \ncircumstances, ten people may have ten different emotional \nresponses. For instance, with a coworker like Louis, some might \nfeel insulted whereas others merely feel curiou s. Some become \nangry and others feel concern or even sympathy. \nWhat is this intermedia te step? Just after we observe what \nothers do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell \nourselves a story. That is, we add meaning to the action we \nobserved. To the simple behavior we add motive. Why were they \ndoing that? We also add judgment- is that good or bad? And \nthen, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with \nan emotion. \nPictorially it looks like the model in Figure 6-2. We call this \nmodel our Path to Action because it explains how emotions, \nthoughts, and experiences lead to our actions. \nYou'll note that we've added telling a story to our model. We \nobserve, we tell a story, and then we feel. Although this addition \ncomplicates things a bit, it also gives us hope. Since we and only\n\f\nSee! Tell a Feel Hear ---.... Story --.... \nFigure 6-2. The Path to Action \nMASTER MY STORIES 99 \nwe are telling the story, we can take back control of our own \nemotions by telling a different story. We now have a point of \nleverage or control. If we can find a way to control the stories we \ntell, by rethinking or retelling them, we can master our emotions \nand, therefore, master our crucial conversations. \nOUR STORIES \n\"Nothing in this world is good or bad, \nbut thinking makes it so. \" \n-WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE \nStories explain what's going on. Exactly what are our stories? \nThey are our interpretations of the facts. They help explain what \nwe see and hear. They're theories we use to explain why, how, \nand what. For instance, Maria asks: \"Why does Louis take over? \nli e doesn't trust my ability to communicate. He thinks that \nbecause I'm a woman, people won't listen to me.\" \nOur stories also help explain how. \"How am I supposed to \nju uge all of this? Is this a good or a bad thing? Louis thinks I'm \nincompetent. and this is bad.\"\n\f\n10 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nFinally , a story might also include what. \"What should I do \nabout all this? If I say something, he'll think I'm a whiner or \noversensitive or militant, so it's best to clam up.\" \nOf course, as we come up with our own meaning or stories, it \nisn't long until our body responds with strong feelings or emo­\ntions-they're directly linked to our judgments of right/wrong, \ngood/bad, kind/selfish, fair/unfair, etc. Maria's story yields anger \nand frustration. These feelings, in turn, drive Maria to her \nactions-tog gling back and forth between clamming up and tak­\ning an occasional cheap shot (see Figure 6-3). \nEven if you don't realize it, you are telling yourself stories. \nWhen we teach people that it's our stories that drive our emotions \nand not other people's actions, someone inevitably raises a hand \nand says, \"Wait a minute! I didn't notice myself telling a story. \nWhen that guy laughed at me during my presentation, I just felt \nangry. The feelings came first; the thoughts came second.\" \nStorytelling typically happens blindingly fast. When we \nbelieve we're at risk, we tell ourselves a story so quickly that we \ndon't even know we're doing it. If you don't believe this is true, \nask yourself whether you always become angry when someone \nSee! \nHear \nTell a \nStory Feel \nLouis He do esn't hurt $ilenoe \nmakes all-....... trust mel-.......wom ed -\"\"\"' Cheap the points, thinkS I'm shots \nmeets prt- weak. If I \nvately With speak up \nthe boss I'U Jook too \nemotional \nFigure 6-3. Maria's Path to Action\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 10 1 \nlaughs at you. If sometimes you do and sometimes you don't, \nthen your response isn 't hardwired . That means something goes \non between others laughing and you feeling. In truth, you tell a \nstory. You may not remember it, but you tell a story. \nAny set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of sto­\nries. Stories are just that, stories. These fabrications could be \ntold in any of thousands of different ways . For instance, Maria \ncould just as easily have decided that Louis didn't realize she \ncared so much about the project. She could have concluded that \nLouis was feeling unimportant and this was a way of showing he \nwas valuable. Or maybe he had been burned in the past because \nhe hadn't personally seen through every detail of a project. Any \nof these stories would have fit the facts and would have created \nvery different emotions. \nIf we take control of our stories, they won 't control us. People \nwho excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during \ncrucial conversations. They recognize that while it's true that at \nfirst we are in control of the stories we tell-a fter all, we do make \nthem up of our own accord-once they're told, the stories con­\ntrol us. They control how we feel and how we act. And as a result, \nthey control the results we get from our crucial conversations . \nBut it doesn't have to be this way. We can tell different stories \nand break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we \ncannot break the loop. \nIf you want improved results from your crucial conversations, \nchange the stories you tell yourself- even while you're in the \nmiddle of the fray. \nSKi llS FOR MASTERING OUR STORIES \nWhat's the most effective way to come up with different stories? \nThe best at dialogue find a way to first slow down and then take \ncharge of their Path to Action. Here's how.\n\f\n10 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nRetrace Your Path \nTo slow down the lightning-quick storytelling process and the \nsubseq uent flow of adrenaline, retrace your Path to Action-one \nelement at a time. This calls for a bit of mental gymnastics. First \nyou have to stop what you're currently doing. Then you have to \nget in touch with why you're doing it. Here's how to retrace your \npath: \n• [Act] Notice your behavior. Ask: \nAm I in some form of silence or violence? \n• [Feel] Get in touch with your feelings. \nWhat emotions are encouraging me to act this way? \n• [Tell story] Analyze your stories. \nWhat story is creating these emotions? \n• [See/hear] Get back to the facts. \nWhat evidence do I have to support this story? \nBy retracing your path one element at a time, you put yourself \nin a position to think about, question, and change any one or \nmore of the elements. \nNo tice Your Beha vior \nWhy would you stop and retrace your Path to Action in the first \nplace? Certainly if you're constantly stopping what you're doing \nand looking for your underlying motive and thoughts, you won't \neven be able to put on your shoes without thinking about it for \nwho knows how long. You'll die of analysis paralysi s. \nActually, you shouldn't constantly stop and question your \nactions. If you Learn to Look (as we suggested in Chapter 4) and \nnote that you yourself are slipping into silence or violence, you \nhave good reason to stop and take stock.\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 10 3 \nBut looking isn't enough. You must take an honest look at \nwhat you're doing. If you tell yourself a story that your violent \nbehavior is a \"necessary tactic,\" you won't see the need to recon­\nsider your actions. If you immediately jump in with \"they started \nit,\" or otherwise find yourself rationalizing your behavior, you \nalso won't feel compelled to change. Rather than stop and review \nwhat you're doing, you'll devote your time to justifying your \nactions to yourself and others . \nWhen an unhelpful story is driving you to silence or violence, \nstop and consider how others would see your actions. For exam­\nple, if the 60 Minu tes camera crew replayed this scene on \nnational television, how would you look? What would they tell \nabout your behavior? \nNot only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice \nwhen they're slipping into silence or violence, but they are also \nable to admit it. They don't wallow in self-doubt, of course, but \nthey do recognize the problem and begin to take corrective \naction. The moment they realize that they're killing dialogue, \nthey review their own Path to Action. \nGet In Touch wi th Your Feelings \nAs skilled individuals begin to retrace their own Path to Action, \nthey immediately move from examining their own unhealthy \nbehavior to exploring their feelings or emotions. At first glance \nthis task sounds easy. \"I'm angry!\" you think to yourself. What \ncould be easier? \nActual ly, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you \nmight imagine . In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. \nWhen asked to describe how they're feeling, they use words such \nas \"bad\" or \"angry\" or \"frightened\"-which would be okay if \nthese were accurate descriptors, but often they're not. \nIndivid uals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a mix \n01' embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they're unhappy\n\f\n10 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nwhen they're feeling viola ted. Perhaps they suggest they're upset \nwhen they're really feeling humiliated and cheated. \nSince life doesn't consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you \nmight wonder what difference words can make. But words do \nmatter. Knowing what you're really feeling helps you take a more \naccurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you're \nfar more likely to take an honest look at the story you're telling \nyourself if you admit you're feeling both embarra ssed and sur­\nprised rather than simply angry. \nHow about you? When experiencing strong emotions, do you \nstop and think about your feelin gs? If so, do you use a rich \nvocabular y, or do you mostly draw from terms such as \"bummed \nout\" and \"furious\"? Second, do you talk openly with others \nabout how you feel? Do you willingly talk with loved ones about \nwhat's going on inside of you? Third, in so doing, is your vocab­\nulary robust and accurate? \nIt's important to get in touch with your feelings, and to do so, \nyou may want to expand your emotional vocabu lary. \nAna lyze Your Storie s \nQuestion your feelings and stories. Once you've identified what \nyou're feeling, you have to stop and ask, given the circum­\nstances, is it the right feeling? Meaning, of course, are you telling \nthe right story? After all, feelings come from stories, and stories \nare our own invention. \nThe first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge \nthe illusion that what you're feeling is the only right emotion \nunder the circumstances. This may be the hardest step, but it's \nalso the most important one. By questioning our feelings, we \nopen ourselves up to question our stories. We challenge the com­\nfortable conclusion that our story is right and true. We willingly \nquestion whether our emotions (very real) , and the story behind \nthem (only one of many possible explanations) , are accu rate.\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 10 5 \nFor instance, what were the facts in Maria's story? She saw \nLouis give the whole presentation. She heard the boss talk about \nmeeting with Louis to discuss the project when she wasn't pres­\nent. That was the beginning of Maria's Path to Action. \nDon 't confuse stories with facts. Sometimes you fail to ques­\ntion your stories because you see them as immutable facts. When \nyou generate stories in the blink of an eye, you can get so caught \nup in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. \nThey feel like facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with \nsteel-hard data points. For example, in trying to ferret out facts \nfrom story, Maria might say, \"H e's a male chauvini st pig-t hat's \na fact ! Ask anyone who has seen how he treats me !\" \n\"He's a male chauvinist pig\" is not a fact. It's the story that \nMaria created to give meaning to the facts. The facts could mean \njust about anything. As we said earlier, others could watch Maria's \ninteractions with Louis and walk away with different stories. \nGet Back to the Facts \nSeparate fact from story by focusing on behavior. To separate \nfact from story, get back to the genuine source of your feelings . \nTest your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear \nthis thing you're calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior? \nFor example, it is a fact that Louis \"gave 95 percent of the pre­\nsentation and answered all but one question.\" This is specific, \nobjective, and verifiable. Any two people watching the meeting \nwould make the same observation. However, the statement \"He \ndoesn't trust me\" is a conclusion. It explains what you think, not \nwhat the other person did. Conclusions are subjective. \nSpot the story by watching for \"hot\" words. Here's another tip. \nTo avoid confusing story with fact, watch for \"hot\" terms. For \ncxample, when assessing the facts, you might say, \"She scowled at \nmc\" or \"He made a sarcastic comment.\" Words such as \"scowl\" \nanu \"sarcastic\" are hot terms. They express judgments and attribu-"

They are story, not fact. \nNotice how much different it is when you say: \"Her eyes pinched \nshut and her lips tightened,\" as opposed to \"She scowled at me.\" In \nMaria's case, she suggested that Louis was controlling and didn't \nrespect her. Had she focused on his behavior (he talked a lot and \nmet with the boss one-on-one) , this less volatile description would \nhave allowed for any number of interpretations. For example, per­\nhaps Louis was nervous, concerned, or unsure of himself. \nWatch for Three \"Clever\" Stories \nAs we begin to piece together why people are doing what they're \ndoing (or equally important, why we're doing what we're doing) , \nwith time and experience we become quite good at coming up \nwith explanations that serve us well. Either our stories are com­\npletely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they're \nquite inaccurate but ju stify our current behavior-making us feel \ngood about ourselves and calling for no need to change. \nIt's the second kind of story that routinely gets us into trouble. \nFor example, we move to silence or violence , and then we come \nup with a perfectly plausible reason for why it's okay. \"Of course \nI yelled at him. Did you see what he did? He deserved it.\" \"Hey, \ndon't be gi\"ing me the evil eye. I had no other choice.\" We call \nthese imaginative and self-serving concoctions \"clever stories.\" \nThey're clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving \nbadly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly \neven while achieving abysmal result s. \nAmong all of the clever stories we tell, here are the three most \ncommon. \nVictim Stories -lilt's Not My Fault\" \nThe first of the clever stories is a Victim Story. Vi ctim Stories, as \nyou might imagine, make us out to be innocent sufferers. The \ntheme is always the same. The other person is bad and wrong,\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 10 7 \nand we are good and rig ht. Other people do bad things, and we \nsuffer as a result. \nIn truth, there is such a thing as an innocent victim. You're \nstopped in the street and held up at gunpoint. When an event \nsuch as this occurs, it's a sad fact, not a story. You are a victim. \nBut all tales of victimization are not so one-sided. When you \ntell a Victim Story, you ignore the role you played in the prob­\nlem. You tell your story in a way that ju diciously avoids facts \nabout whatever you have done (or neglected to do) that might \nhave contributed to the problem. \nFor insta nce, last week your boss took you off a big project, \nand it hurt your feelings . You complained to everyone about \nhow bad you felt. Of course, you failed to let your boss know \nthat you were behind on an important project, leaving him \nhigh and dry-which is why he removed you in the first place. \nThis part of the story you leave out because, hey, he made you \nfeel bad. \nTo help support your Vi ctim Stories you speak of nothing but \nyour noble motives. \"I took longer because I was trying to beat \nthe standard specs.\" Then you tell yourself that you're being pun­\nished for your virtues, not your vice s. \"He just doesn't appreci­\nate a person with my superb attention to detail.\" (This added \ntwist turns you from victim into martyr. What a bonus !) \nVillain Stories -\"It's All Your Fault\" \nWe create these nasty little tales by turning normal, decent \nhuman beings into villains. We impute bad motive, and then we \ntell everyone about the evils of the other party as if somehow \nwe 're doing the world a huge favor. \nFor example, we describe a boss who is zealous about quality \nliS a control freak. When our spouse is upset that we didn't keep \na c om mi tment, we see him or her as inflexible and stubborn. \nIn Victim Stor ies we eX�lggcrate our own innocence. In Vi llain\n\f\n1 08 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nStories we overemphasize the other person's guilt. We automatical­\nly assume the worst possible motives while ignoring any possible \ngood or neutral intentions a person may have. Labeling is a common \ndevice in Villain Stories. For example, \"I can't believe that bonehead \ngave me bad materials again.\" By employing the handy label, we are \nnow dealing not with a complex human being, but with a bonehead. \nNot only do Vi llain Stories help us blame others for bad \nresults, but they also set us up to then do whatever we want to \nthe \"villai ns.\" After all, we can feel okay insulting or abusing a \nbonehead-whereas we might have to be more careful with a \nliving, breathing person. Then when we fail to get the results we \nreally want, we stay stuck in our ineffective behavior because, \nafter all, look who we're dealing with! \nWatch for the double standard. When you pay attention to \nVi ctim and Vi llain Stories and catch them for what they are­\nunfair characterizations-you begin to see the terrible double \nstandard we use when our emotions are out of control. When we \nmake mistak es, we tell a Vi ctim Story by claiming our intentions \nwere innocent and pure. \"Sure 1 was late getting home and didn't \ncall you, but I couldn't let the team down!\" On the other hand, \nwhen others do things that hurt us, we tell Vi llain Stories in \nwhich we invent terrible motives for others based on how their \nactions affected us. \"You are so thoughtless! You could have \ncalled me and told me you were going to be late.\" \nHelpless Stories- \"There's Nothing Else I Can Do\" \nFinally come Helpless Stories. In these fabrications we make our­\nselves out to be powerless to do anything. We convince ourselves \nthat there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predica­\nment, which justifies the action we're about to take. A Helpless \nStory might suggest, \"If 1 didn't yell at my son, he wouldn't listen.\" \nOr on the flip side, \"If I told my husband this, he would just be"

For example, when \nwe decide our boss is a \"control freak\" (Villain Story), we are \nless inclined to give him feedback because, after all, control \nfreaks like him don't accept feedback (Helpless Story). Nothing \nwe can do will change that fact. \nAs you can see, Helpl ess Stories often stem from Villain Stories \nand typically offer us nothing more than Sucker's Choices. \nWhy We Tell Clever Stories \nThey match reality. Sometimes the stories we tell are accurate. \nThe other person is trying to cause us harm, we are innocent vic­\ntims, or maybe we really can't do much about the problem. It can \nhappen. It' s not common, but it can happen. \nThey get us off the hook. More often than not, our conclusions \ntransform from reasonable explanations to clever stories when \nthey conveniently excuse us from any responsibility-when, in \nreali ty, we have been partially responsible. The other person isn't \nbad and wrong, and we aren't right and good. The truth lies \nsomewhere in the middle . However, if we can make others out \nas wrong and ourselves out as right, we're off the hook. Better \nyet, once we've demonized others, we can even insult and abuse \nthem if we want. \nClever stories keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts. \nBy now it should be clear that clever stories cause us problems. \nA reasonable question at this point is, \"If they're so terribly hurt­\nful, why do we ever tell clever stories?\" \nOur need to tell clever stories often starts with our own sellouts. \nl, ike it or not, we usually don't begin telling stories that jus tify our \nad ions until we have done something that we feel a need to\n\f\n11 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \njust ify. 1 \nWe sell out when we consciously act against our own sense of \nwhat's right. And after we've sold out, we have only two choices: \nown up to our sellout, or try to jus tify it. And if we don't admit \nto our errors, we inevitably look for ways to justify them. That's \nwhen we begin to tell clever stories. \nLet's look at an example of a sellout: You're driving in heavy \ntraffic. You begin to pass cars that are attempting to merge into \nyour lane. A car very near you has accelerated and is entering your \nlane. A thought strikes you that you should let him in. It's the nice \nthing to do, and you'd want someone to let you in. But you don't. \nYou accelerate forward and close the gap. What happens next? \nYou begin to have thoughts like these: \"He can't just crowd in on \nme. What a jerk! I've been fighting this traffic a long time. Besides, \nI've got an important appointment to get to.\" And so on. \nThis story makes you the innocent victim and the other per­\nson the nasty villain . Under the influence of this story you now \nfeel jus tified in not doing what you originally thought you should \nhave done. You also ignore what you would think of others who \ndid the same thing-\"That jerk didn't let me in !\" \nConsider an example more related to crucial conversations . \nYour spouse has an annoying habit. It's not a big deal, but you \nfeel you should mention it. But you don't. Instead, you just huff \nor roll your eyes, hoping that will send the message. Unfortun­\nately, your spouse doesn't pick up the hint and continues the habit. \nYour annoyance turns to resentment. You feel disgusted that your \nspouse is so thick that he or she can't pick up an obvious hint. And \nbesides, you shouldn't have to mention this anyway-any reason­\nable person should notice this on his or her own! Do you have to \npoint out everything? From this point forward you begin to make \ninsulting wisecracks about the issue until it escalates into an ugly \nconfrontation. \nNotice the order of the events in both of these examples. What\n\f\nMASTER MY STORI ES 111 \ncame first, the story or the sellout? Did you convince yourself of \nthe other driver's selfishness and then not let him in? Of course \nnot. You had no reason to think he was selfish until you needed \nan excuse for your own selfish behavior. You didn't start telling \nclever stories until after you failed to do something you knew you \nshould have done. Your spouse's annoying habit didn't become a \nsource of resentment until you became part of the problem. You \ngot upset because you sold out. And the clever story helped you \nfeel good about being rude. \nSellouts are often not big events. In fact, they can be so small \nthat they're easy for us to overlook when we're crafting our \nclever stories. Here are some common ones: \n• You believe you should help someone, but don't. \n• You believe you should apologize, but don't. \n• You believe you should stay late to finish up on a commitment, \nbut go home instead. \n• You say yes when you know you should say no, then hope no \none follows up to see if you keep your commitment. \n• You believe you should talk to someone about concerns you \nhave with him or her, but don't. \n• You do less than your share and think you should acknowl­\nedge it, but say nothing knowing no one else will bring it up \neither. \n• You believe you should listen respectfully to feedback, but \nbecome defensive instead. \n• You see problems with a plan someone presents and think you \nshould speak up, but don't. \n• You fail to complete an assignment on time and believe you \nshould let others know, but don't."

We tell a clever story when we want \nself-justification more than results. Of course, self-justification is \nnot what we really want, but we certainly act as if it is. \nWith that sad fact in mind, let's focus on what we really want. \nLet's look at the final Master My Stories skill. \nTell the Rest of the Story \nOnce we've learned to recognize the clever stories we tell our­\nselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill. The dia­\nlogue-smart recognize that they're telling clever stories, stop, \nand then do what it takes to tell a useful story. A useful story, by \ndefinition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action-such as \ndialogue. \nAnd what transforms a clever story into a useful one? The rest \nof the story. That's because clever stories have one characteristic \nin common: They're incomplete. Clever stories omit crucial \ninformation about us, about others, and about our options. Only \nby including all of these essential details can clever stories be \ntransformed into useful ones. \nWhat's the best way to fill in the missing details? Quite sim­\nply, it's done by turning victims into actors, villains into humans, \nand the helpless into the able. Here's how. \nTurn victims into actors. If you notice that you're talking \nabout yourself as an innocent victim (and you weren't held up at \ngunpoint) , ask: \n• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the probl em?\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 11 3 \nThis question jars you into facing up to the fact that maybe, \njust maybe, you did something to help cause the problem. Instead \nof being a victim, you were an actor. This doesn't necessarily \nmean you had malicious motives. Perhaps your contribution was \nmerely a thoughtless omission. Nonetheless, you contributed. \nFor example , a coworker constantly leaves the harder or nox­\nious tasks for you to complete. You've frequently complained to \nfriends and loved ones about being exploited. The parts you \nleave out of the story are that you smile broadly when your boss \ncompliments you for your willingn ess to take on challenging \njobs, and you've never said anything to your coworker. You've \nhinted, but that's about it. \nThe first step in telling the rest of this story would be to add \nthese important facts to your account. By asking what role \nyou've played, you begin to realize how selective your perception \nhas been. You become aware of how you've minimized your own \nmistakes while you've exaggerated the role of others. \nTurn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or \notherwise vilifying others, stop and ask: \n• Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what \nthis person is doing? \nThis particular question humanizes others. As we search for \nplausible answers to it, our emotions soften. Empathy often \nreplaces judgment, and depending upon how we've treated oth­\ners, personal accountabi lity replaces self-justification. \nFor instance, that coworker who seems to conveniently miss \nout on the tough jo bs told you recently that she could see you \nwere struggling with an important assi gnment, and yesterday \n(while you were tied up on a pressing task) she pitched in and \ncompleted the job for you. You were instantly suspicious. She \nW'lS tryi ng to make you look bad by completing a high-profile \njub. Huw dare she prctcnd to be helpful when her real goal was\n\f\n11 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nto discredit you while tooting her own hom! Well, that's the \nstory you've told yourself. \nBut what if she really were a reasonable, rational, and decent \nperson? What if she had no motive other than to give you a \nhand? Isn't it a bit early to be vilifying her? And if you do, don't \nyou run the risk of ruining a relationship? Might you go off half­\ncocked, accuse her, and then learn you were wrong? \nOur purpose for asking why a reasonable, rational, and decent \nperson might be acting a certain way is not to excuse others for \nany bad things they may be doing. If they are, indeed, guilty, \nwe'll have time to deal with that later. The purpose of the \nhumanizing question is to deal with our own stories and emo­\ntions. It provides us with still another tool for working on our­\nselves first by providing a variety of possible reasons for the \nother person's behavior. \nIn fact, with experience and maturity we learn to worry less \nabout others' intent and more about the effect others' actions are \nhaving on us. No longer are we in the game of rooting out \nunhealthy motives. And here's the good news. When we reflect \non alternative motives, not only do we soften our emotions, but \nequally important, we relax our absolute certainty long enough \nto allow for dialogue-the only reliable way of discovering oth­\ners' genuine motives. \nTurn the helpless into the abl e. Final ly, when you catch your­\nself bemoaning your own helples sness, you can tell the complete \nstory by returning to your original motive. To do so, stop and ask: \n• What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relation­\nship? \nThen, kill the Sucker's Choice that's made you feel helpless to \nchoose anything other than silence or violence. Do this by asking: \n• What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?\n\f\nMASTER MY STORI ES 11 5 \nFor example, you now find yourself insulting your coworker \nfor not pitching in with a tough job. Your coworker seems sur­\nprised at your strong and \"out of the blue\" reaction. In fact, she's \nstaring at you as if you've slipped a cog. You, of course, have told \nyourself that she is purposefully avoiding noxious tasks, and that \ndespite your helpful hints, she has made no changes. \n\"I have to get brutal,\" you tell yourself. \"I don't like it, but if \n1 don't offend her, I'll be stuck doing the grunt work forever.\" \nYou've strayed from what you really want-to share work \nequally and to have a good relationship. You've given up on half \nof your goals by making a Sucker's Choice. \"Oh well, better to \noffend her than to be made a fool.\" \nWhat should you be doing instead? Openly, honestly, and \neffectively discussing the problem-not taking potshots and \nthen justifying yourself. When you refuse to make yourself help­\nless, you're forced to hold yourself accountable for using your \ndialogue skills rather than bemoaning your weaknes s. \nMARIA'S NE W STORY \nTo see how this all fits together, let's circle back to Maria. Let's \nassume she's retraced her Path to Action and separated the facts \nfrom the stories. Doing this has helped her realize that the story \nshe told was incomplete, defensive, and hurtful. When she \nwatched for the Three Clever Stories, she saw them with painful \nclarity. Now she's ready to tell the rest of the story. So she asks \nherself: \n• Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem? \n\"When I found out that Louis was holding project meetings \nwithout me, I felt like I should ask him about why I wasn 't \ninclu ded. I believed that if I did, I could open a dialogue that \nwould help us work better together. But then I didn 't, and as"

Best of all, as we regain \ncontrol and move back to dialogue, we become masters of our \nown emotions rather than hostages. \nAnd what about Maria? What did she actually do? She sched­\nuled a meeting with Louis. As she prepared for the meeting, she \nrefused to feed her ugly and incomplete stories, admitted her \nown role in the problem, and entered the conversation with an \nopen mind. Perhaps Louis wasn't trying to make her appear bad \nor fill in for her incompetence. \nAs Maria sat down with Louis, she found a way to tentatively \nshare what she had observed. (We'll look at exactly how to do \nthis in the next chapter.) Fortunat ely, not only did Maria master \nher story, but she knew how to talk about it as well. While \nengaging in healthy dialogue, Louis apologized for not includ­\ning her in meetings with the boss. He explained that he was try­\ning to give the boss a heads-up on some controversial parts of\n\f\nMASTER MY STORIES 11 7 \nthe presentation-and realized in retrospect that he shouldn't \nhave done this without her. He also apologized for dominating \nduring the presentation. Maria learned from the conversation \nthat Louis tends to talk more when he gets nervous. He sug­\ngested that they each be responsible for either the first or sec­\nond half of the presentation and stick to their assi gnments so he \nwould be less likely to crowd her out.

    "raw_text": "12 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nand generally weave them into conversations that suit our needs. \nMost of the time. \nHowever, when stakes rise and our emotions kick in, well, \nthat's when we open our mouths and don't do so well. In fact, as \nwe suggested earlier, the more important the discussion, the less \nlikely we are to be on our best behavior. More specifically, we \nadvocate or express our views quite poorly. \nTo help us improve our advocacy skills, we'll examine two \nchallenging situations. First, we'll look at five skills for talking \nwhen what we have to say could easily make others defensive. \nSecond, we'll explore how these same skills help us state our \nopinions when we believe so strongly in something that we risk \nshutting others down rather than opening them up to our ideas. \nSHARING RISKY MEAN ING \nAdding information to the pool of meaning can be quite difficult \nwhen the ideas we're about to dump into the collective conscious­\nness contain delicate, unattractive, or controversial opinions. \n\"I'm sorry, Marta, but people simply don't like working with \nyou. You've been asked to leave the special-proj ects team.\" \nIt's one thing to argue that your company needs to shift from \ngreen to red packaging; it's quite another to tell a person that he \nor she is offensive or unlikable or has a controlling leadership \nstyle. When the topic turns from things to people, it's always \nmore difficult, and to nobody's surprise, some people are better \nat it than others . \nWhen it comes to sharing touchy information, the worst alter­\nnate between bluntly dumping their ideas into the pool and say­\ning nothing at all. Either they start with: \"Y ou're not going to like \nthis, but, hey, somebody has to be honest ... \" (a classic Sucker's \nChoice), or they simply stay mum.\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 121 \nFearful they could easily destroy a healthy relationship, those \nwho are good at dialogue say some of what's on their minds but \nunderstate their views out of fear of hurting others. They talk, \nbut they sugarcoat their message. \nThe best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in \na way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say \nand respond to it as well. They are both totally frank and com­\npletely respectful. \nMAINTAIN SAFETY \nIn order to speak honestly when honesty could easily offend oth­\ners, we have to find a way to maintain safety. That's a bit like \ntelling someone to smash another person in the nose, but, you \nknow, don't hurt him. How can we speak the unspeakable and still \nmaintain respect? Actually, it can be done if you know how to \ncarefully blend three ingredients- confidence, humility, and skill . \nConfidence. Most people simply won't hold delicate conversa­\ntions-well, at least not with the right person. For instance, your \ncolleague Brian goes home at night and tells his wife that his boss, \nFernando, is micromanaging him to within an inch of his life. He \nsays the same thing over lunch when talking with his pals. Every­\none knows what Brian thinks about Fernando-except, of course, \nFernando. \nPeople who are skilled at dialogue have the confidence to say \nwhat needs to be said to the person who needs to hear it. They \nare confident that their opinions deserve to be placed in the pool \nof meaning. They are also confident that they can speak openly \nwithout brutalizing others or causing undue offense. \nHumility. Confidence does not equate to arrogance or pig­\nheadedness. Skilled people are confident that they have some­\nthing to say, but also realize that others have valuable input. They \nal 'e humble enough to realize that they don't have a monopoly on\n\f\n12 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthe truth. Their opinions provide a starting point but not the final \nword. They may currently believe something but realize that with \nnew information they may change their minds. This means \nthey're willing to both express their opinions and encourage oth­\ners to do the same \nSkill. Fina lly, people who willingly share delicate information \nare good at doing it. That's why they're confident in the first \nplace. They don't make a Sucker's Choice because they've found \na path that allows for both candor and safety. They speak the \nunspeakable, and people are grateful for their honesty. \nGood Nigh t and Good -Bye! \nTo see how to discuss sensitive issues, let's look at an enormously \ndifficult problem. Bob has just walked in the door, and his wife, \nCarole, looks upset. He can tell from her swollen eyes that she's \nbeen crying. Only when he walks in the door, Carole doesn't turn \nto him for comfort. Instead, she looks at him with an expression \nthat says \"How could you?\" Bob doesn't know it yet, but Carole \nthinks he's having an affair. He's not. \nHow did Carole come to this dangerous and wrong con­\nclusion? Earlier that day she had been going over the credit card \nstatement when she noticed a charge from the Good Night \nMotel-a cheap place located not more than a mile from their \nhome. \"Why would he stay in a motel so close to home?\" she \nwonders. \"And why didn't I know about it?\" Then it hits her­\n\"That unfaithful jerk !\" \nNow what's the worst way Carole might handle this (one that \ndoesn't involve packing up and moving back to Wisconsin)? \nWhat's the worst way of talking about the problem? Most peo­\nple agree that jumping in with an ugly accusation followed by a \nthreat is a good candidate for that distinction. It's also what most \npeople do, and Carole is no exception."

    "raw_text": "12 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nstay in dialogue. That holds true for anybody with any crucial \nconversation (i.e., It feels like you micromanage me; I fear you're \nusing drugs). That means that despite your worst suspicions, you \nshouldn't violate respect. In a similar vein, you shouldn't kill \nsafety with threats and accusation s. \nSo what should you do? Start with Heart. Think about what you \nreally want and how dialogue can help you get it. And master your \nstory-realize that you may be jumping to a hasty Vi ctim, Villain, \nor Helpless Story. The best way to fmd out the true story is not to \nact out the worst story you can generate. That will lead to self­\ndestructive silence and violence games. Think about other possible \nexplanations long enough to temper your emotions so you can get \nto dialogue. Besides, if it turns out you're right about your initial \nimpression, there will be plenty of time for confrontations later on. \nOnce you've worked on yourself to create the right conditions \nfor dialogue, you can then draw upon five distinct skills that can \nhelp you talk about even the most sensitive topics. These five tools \ncan be easily remembered with the acronym STATE. It stands for: \n• Share your facts \n• Tell your story \n• Ask for others' paths \n• Talk tentatively \n• E.ncourage testing \nThe first three skills describe what to do. The last two tell how \nto do it. \nThe \"What\" Ski lls \n,Share Your Facts \nIn the last chapter we suggested that if you retrace your Path to \nAction to the source, you eventually arrive at the (\"acts. For\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 12 5 \nexample, Carole found the credit card invoice. That's a fact. She \nthen told a story -Bob's having an affair. Next, she felt betrayed \nand horrified. Final ly, she attacked Bob-\"I should never have \nmarried you !\" The whole interaction was fast, predictable, and \nvery ugly. \nWhat if Carole took a different route-one that started with \nfacts? What if she were able to suspend the ugly story she told her­\nself (perhaps think of an alternative story) and then start her con­\nversation with the facts? Wouldn't that be a safer way to go? \n\"Maybe,\" she muses, \"there is a good reason behind all of this. \nWhy don't I start with the suspicious bill and then go from there?\" \nIf she started there, she'd be right. The best way to share your \nview is to follow your Path to Action from beginning to end­\nthe same way you traveled it (Figure 7-1 ). Unfortunately, when \nwe're drunk on adrenaline, our tendency is to do precisely the \nopposite. Since we're obses sing on our emotions and stories, \nthat's what we start with. Of course, this is the most controver­\nsial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin. \nTo make matters worse, this strategy creates still another self­\nfulfilling prophecy. We're so anxious to blurt out our ugly stories \nSee! Tell a Feel Hear --... Story --... \nFigure 7-1. The Path to Action\n\f\n12 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthat we say things in extremely ineffective ways . Then, when \nwe get bad results (and we are going to get bad result s), we tell \nourselves that we just can't share risky views without creating \nproblems. So the next time we've got something sticky to say, \nwe're even more reluctant to say it. We hold it inside where the \nstory builds up steam, and when we do eventually share our \nhorrific story, we do so with a vengeance. The cycle starts all \nover again. \nFacts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. \nBy their very nature, facts aren't controversial. That's why we call \nthem facts. For example, consider the statement: \"Y esterday you \narrived at work twenty minutes late.\" No dispute there. \nConclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For \nexample: \"You can't be trusted.\" That's hardly a fact. Actually, it's \nmore like an insult, and it can certainly be disputed. Eventually we \nmay want to share our conclusions, but we certainly don't want to \nopen up with a controversy. \nFacts are the most persuasive. In addition to being less contro­\nversial, facts are also more persuasive than subjective conclusions. \nFacts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade \nothers, don't start with your stories. Start with your observations. \nFor example, which of the following do you fmd more persuasive? \nor \n\"I want you to stop sexually harassing me!\" \n\"When you talk to me, your eyes move up and down rather \nthan look at my face. And sometimes you put your hand on \nmy shoulder.\" \nWhile we're speaking here about being persuasive, let's add \nthat our goal is not to persuade others that we are right. We \naren't trying to \"win\" the dialogue. We just want our meaning to \nget a fair hearing. We're trying to help others sec how a rca SOIl-\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 12 7 \nable, rational, and decent person could end up with the story \nwe're carrying. That's all. \nWhen we start with shocking or offensive conclusions (\"Q uit \ngroping me with your eyes !\" or \"I think we should declare bank­\nruptcy\" ), we actually encourage others to tell Villain Stories \nabout us. Since we've given them no facts to support our con­\nclusion, they make up reasons we're saying these things. They're \nlikely to believe we're either stupid or evil. \nSo if your goal is to help others see how a reasonable, ration­\nal, and decent person could think what you're thinking, start \nwith your facts. \nAnd if you aren't sure what your facts are (your story is \nabs olutely filling your brain ), take the time to think them \nthrough before you enter the crucial conversation. Take the time \nto sort out facts from conclusi ons. Gathering the facts is the \nhomework required for crucial conversations . \nFacts are the least insul ting. If you do want to share your \nstory, don't start with it. Your story (particularly if it has led to a \nrather ugly conclusion) could easily surprise and insult others. It \ncould kill safety in one rash, ill-conceived sentence. \nBRIAN: I'd like to talk to you about your leadership style. \nYou micromanage me, and it's starting to drive me nuts. \nFERNA NDO: What? I ask you if you're going to be done on \ntime and you lay into me with ... \nIf you start with your story (and in so doing, kill safety), you \nmay never actually get to the facts. \nBegin your path with facts. In order to talk about your stories, \nyou need to lead the others involved down your Path to Action. \nLet them experience your path from the beginning to the end, \nand not from the end to-well, to wherever it takes you. Let oth­\ners see your experience from your point of view-sta rting with\n\f\n12 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nyour facts. This way, when you do talk about what you're start­\ning to conclude, they'll understand why. First the facts, then the \nstory-and then make sure that as you explain your story, you \ntell it as a possible story, not as concrete fact. \nBRIAN: Since I started work here, you've asked to meet with \nme twice a day. That's more than with anyone else. You \nhave also asked me to pass all of my ideas by you before I \ninclude them in a project. [The facts] \nFERNA NDO: What's your point? \nBRIAN: I'm not sure that you're intending to send this mes­\nsage, but I'm beginning to wonder if you don't trust me. \nMaybe you think I'm not up to the job or that I'll get \nyou into trouble. Is that what's going on? [The possible \nstory] \nFERNA NDO: Real ly, I was merely trying to give you a chance \nto get my input before you got too far down the path on a \nproject. The last guy I worked with was constantly taking \nhis project to near completion only to learn that he'd left \nout a key element. I'm trying to avoid surpr ises. \nEarn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. \nFacts lay the groundwork for all delicate conversations. \nleI! Your Story \nSharing your story can be tricky. Even if you've started with your \nfacts, the other person can still become defensive when you \nmove from facts to stories. After all, you're sharing potentially \nunflattering conclusions and ju dgments. \nWhy share your story in the first place? Because the facts \nalone are rarely worth mentioning. It's the facts plus the conclu­\nsion that call for a face-to-face discussion. In addition, if you\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 12 9 \nsimply mention the facts, the other person may not understand \nthe severity of the implicatio ns. For example: \n\"I noticed that you had company software in your brief­\ncase.\" \n\"Yep, that's the beauty of software. It's portab le.\" \n\"That particular software is proprietary. \" \n\"It ought to be ! Our future depends on it.\" \n\"My understanding is that it's not supposed to go home.\" \n\"Of course not. That's how people steal it.\" \n(Sounds like it's time for a conclus ion .) \"I was wondering what \nthe software is doing in your briefcase. It looks like you're tak­\ning it home. Is that what's going on here?\" \nIt takes confidence. To be honest, it can be difficult to share \nnegative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., \"I'm \nwondering if you're a thief\"). It takes confidence to share such a \npotentially inflammatory story. However, if you've done your \nhomework by thinking through the facts behind your story you'll \nrealize that you are drawing a reasonable, rational, and decent \nconclusion. One that deserves hearing. And by starting with the \nfacts, you've laid the groundwork. By thinking through the facts \nand then lea ding with them, you're much more likely to have the \nconfidence you need to add controversial and vitally important \nmeaning to the shared pool. \nDon 't pile it on. Sometimes we lack the confidence to speak \nup, so we let problems simmer for a long time. Given the \nchance, we generate a whole arsenal of unflat tering conclu­\nsions. For example, you're about to hold a crucial conversation \nwith your child's second-grade teacher. The teacher wants to \nhold your daughter back a year. You want your daughter to \nadvance right along with her age group. This is what's going on \nin your head:\n\f\n13 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n\"I can't believe this ! This teacher is straight out of college, \nand she wants to hold Debbie back. To be perfectly frank, \nI don't think she gives much weight to the stigma of being \nheld back. Worse still, she's quoting the recommendation of \nthe school psychologi st. The guy's a real idiot. I've met him, \nand I wouldn't trust him with a common cold. I'm not \ngoing to let these two morons push me around.\" \nWhich of these insulting conclusions or judgments should you \nshare? Certainly not the entire menagerie of unflattering tales. In \nfact, you're going to need to work on this Villain Story before \nyou have any hope of healthy dialogue. As you do, your story \nbegins to sound more like this (note the careful choice of \nterms-after all, it is your story, not the facts): \n\"When I first heard your recommendation, my initial reac­\ntion was to oppose your decision. But after thinking about \nit, I've realized I could be wrong. I realized I don't really \nhave any experience about what's best for Debbie in this \nsituation-only fears about the stigma of being held back. \nI know it's a complex issue. I'd like to talk about how both \nof us can more objectively weigh this decision.\" \nLook for safety problems. As you share your story, watch for \nsigns that safety is deteriorating. If people start becoming defen­\nsive or appear to be insulted, step out of the conversation and \nrebuild safety by Contrasting. \nUse Contrasting. Here's how it works : \n\"I know you care a great deal about my daughter, and I'm \nconfident you're well-trained. That's not my concern at all. \nI know you want to do what's best for Debbie, and I do too. \nMy only issue is that this is an ambiguous decision with \nhuge implications for the rest of her life.\"\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 131 \nBe careful not to apologize for your views. Remember, the \ngoal of Contrasting is not to water down your message, but to be \nsure that people don't hear more than you intend. Be confident \nenough to share what you really want to express. \nAsk for Other s' Paths \nWe mentioned that the key to sharing sensitive ideas is a blend \nof confidence and humility. We express our confidence by shar­\ning our facts and stories clearly. We demonstrate our humility by \nthen asking others to share their views . \nSo once you've shared your point of view-fac ts and stories \nalike-invite others to do the same. If your goal is to learn rather \nthan to be right, to make the best decision rather than to get your \nway, then you'll be willing to hear other views. By being open to \nlearning we are demonstrating humility at its best. \nFor example, ask yourself: \"What does the schoolteacher \nthink?\" \"Is your boss really intending to micromanage you?\" \"Is \nyour spouse really having an affair?\" \nTo find out others' views on the matter, encourage them to \nexpress their facts, stories, and feelings. Then carefully listen to \nwhat they have to say. Equally important, be willing to abandon \nor reshape your story as more information pours into the Pool of \nShared Meaning . \nThe \"Ho w\" Skills \nIa lk Tentatively \nIf you look back at the vignettes we've shared so far, you'll note \nthat we were careful to describe both facts and stories in a ten­\ntative way. For exa mple, \"I was wondering why ... \" \nTalking tentatively simply means that we tell our story as a \nstory rather than disguising it as a fact. \"Perhaps you were"

Not only should you invite \nothers to talk, but you have to do so in a way that makes it clear \nthat no matter how controversial their ideas are, you want to \nhear them. Others need to feel safe sharing their obs ervations \nand stories-e ven if they differ. Otherw ise, they don't speak up \nand you can't test the accuracy and relevance of your views . \nThis becomes particularly important when you're having a \ncrucial conversation with people who might move to silence. \nSome people make Sucker's Choices in these circumstances. \nThey worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam \nup. So they choose between speaking their minds and hearing \nothers out. But the best at dialogue don't choose. They do both. \nThey understand that the only limit to how strongly you can \nexpress your opinion is your willing ness to be equally vigorous \nin encouraging others to challenge it. \nInvite opposing views. So if you think others may be hesitant, \nmake it clear that you want to hear their views-no matter their \nopinion. If they disagree, so much the better. If what they have \nto say is controversial or even touchy, respect them for finding \nthe courage to express what they're thinking. If they have differ­\nent facts or stories, you need to hear them to help complete the \npicture. Make sure they have the opportunity to share by active­\nly inviting them to do so: \"Does anyone see it differently?\" \n\"What am I missing here?\" \"I'd really like to hear the other side \nof this story.\" \nMean it. Sometimes people offer an invi tation that sounds \nmore like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions. \"Well, \nthat's how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?\" Invite people \nwith both words and tone that say \"I really want to hear from \nyou.\" For instance: \"I know people have been reluctant to speak \nup about this, but I would really love to hear from everyone.\"\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 13 5 \nOr: \"I know there are at least two sides to this story. Could we \nhear differing views now? What problems could this decision \ncause us?\" \nPlay devil's advocate. Occasionally you can tell that others are \nnot buying into your facts or story, but they're not speaking up \neither. You've sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing \nviews , but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play \ndevil's advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your \nown view. \"Maybe I'm wrong here. What if the opposite is true? \nWhat if the reason sales have dropped is because ... \" \nBACK TO THE MOTEL \nTo see how all of the STATE skills fit together in a touchy con­\nversation, let's return to the motel bill.

[Encourages testing] \nBOB : Not at all. Let's give them a call and find out what's \ngoing on. \nWhen this conversation actually did take place, it sounded \nexactly like the one portrayed above. The suspicious spouse \navoided nasty accusations and ugly stories, shared facts, and \nthen tentatively shared a pos sible conclu sion. As it turns out, \nthe couple had gone out to a Chinese restau rant earlier that \nmonth. The owner of the resta urant also owned the motel and \nused the same credit card imprinting machine at both estab­\nlish ments.

It's the kind of thing you do all the time. You do it \nat home, you do it at work, and yes, you've even been known to \nfire off an opinion or two while standing in line at the DMV . \nUnfortunately, as stakes rise and others argue differing \nviews- and you just know in your heart of hearts that you 're \nright and they're wrong-you start pushing too hard. You simply \nhave to win. There's too much at risk and only you have the right \nideas. Left to their own devices, others will mess things up. So \nwhen you care a great deal and are sure of your views, you don't \nmerely speak-you try to force your opinions on others. Quite \nnatura lly, others resist. You in turn push even harder. \nAs consultants, we (the authors) watch this kind of thing hap­\npen all the time. For instance, seated around the table is a group \nof leaders who are starting to debate an important topic. First, \nsomeone hints that she's the only one with any real insight. Then \nsomeone else starts tossing out facts like so many poisonous \ndarts. Another-it just so happens someone with critical infor­\nmation-retreats into silence. As emotions rise, words that were \nonce carefully chosen and tentatively delivered are now spouted \nwith an absolute certainty that is typically reserved for claims \nthat are nailed to church doors or carved on stone tablet s. \nIn the end, nobody is listening, everyone is committed to \nsilence or violence, and the Pool of Shared Meaning is dry. \nNobody wins. \nHow Did We Get like This? \nIt starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas \non others, it's generally because we believe we're right and every­\none else is wrong. There's no need to expand the pool of mean­\ning. because we own the pool. We also firmly believe it's our duty \nto fight for the truth that we're holding. It's the honorable thing \ntu do.

Once we're convinced \nthat it's our duty to fight for the truth, we start pulling out the \nbig guns. We use debating tricks that we've picked up through­\nout the years. Chief among them is the ability to \"stack the \ndeck.\" We cite information that supports our ideas while hiding \nor discrediting anything that doesn't. Then we spice things up \nwith exaggeration: \"Everyone knows that this is the only way to \ngo.\" When this doesn't work, we lace our language with inflam­\nmatory terms: \"All right- thinking people would agree with me.\" \nFrom there we employ any number of dirty tricks. We appeal \nto authority: \"Well, that's what the boss thinks .\" We attack the \nperson: \"You're not so naive as to actually believe that?\" We \ndraw hasty generalizations: \"If it happened in our overseas oper­\nation, it'll happen here for sure .\" \nAnd again, the harder we try and the more forceful our tac­\ntics, the greater the resistance we create, the worse the results, \nand the more battered our relationship s. \nHow Do We Change? \nThe solution to excessive advocacy is actually rather simple-if \nyou can just bring yourself to do it. When you find yourself just \ndying to convince others that your way is best, back off your cur­\nrent attack and think about what you really want for yourself, \nothers, and the relationship. Then ask yourself, \"How would I \nbehave if these were the results I really wanted?\" When your \nadrenaline level gets below the 0.05 legal limit, you'll be able to \nuse your STATE skill s. \nFirst, watch for the moment when people start to resist you. \nTurn your attention from the topic (no matter how important) to\n\f\nSTATE MY PATH 13 9 \nyourself. Are you leaning forward? Are you speaking more \nloudly? Are you starting to try to win? Are you speaking in \nlengthy monologues and using dirty tricks? Remember: The \nmore you care about an issue, the less likely you are to be on \nyour best behavior. \nSecond, tone down your approach.

On the other hand, when \nwe ourselves are pushing hard, it's the correct thing to do. \nRig ht? \nLet's face it. When it comes to our strongest views, passion \ncan be our enemy. Of course, feeling strongly about something \nisn't bad in and of itself. It's okay to have strong opinions. The \nproblem comes when we try to express them. \nFor instance, when we believe strongly in a concept or a \ncause, our emotions kick in and we start trying to force our way \nonto others. As our emotions kick in, our ideas no longer flow \ninto the pool. Instead, our thoughts shoot out of our mouths like \nwater out of a raging fire hydrant. And guess what-others \nbecome defensive.

    "raw_text": "14 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe answer is a resounding \"It depends.\" If you want to let a \nsleeping dog lie (or, in this case, a potential train wreck go unat­\ntended), then say nothing. It's the other person who seems to \nhave something to say but refuses to open up. It's the other per­\nson who's blown a cork. Run for cover. You can't take responsi­\nbility for someone else's thoughts and feelings. Right ? \nThen again, you'll never work through your differences until \nall parties freely add to the pool of meaning. That means the peo­\nple who are blowing up or clamming up must participate as well. \nAnd while it's true that you can't force others to dialogue, you \ncan take steps to make it safer for them to do so. After all, that's \nwhy they've sought the security of silence or violence in the first \nplace. They're afraid that dialogue will make them vulnerable. \nSomehow they believe that if they engage in real conversation \nwith you, bad things will happen. Your daughter, for instance, \nbelieves that if she talks with you, she'll be lectured, grounded, \nand cut off from the only guy who seems to care about her. \nRestoring safety is your greatest hope to get your relationship \nback on track. \nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS \nIn Chapter 5 we recommended that whenever you notice safety \nis at risk, you should step out of the conversation and restore it. \nWhen you have offended others through a thoughtless act, apol­\nogize. Or if someone has misunderstood your intent, use \nContrasting. Explain what you do and don't intend. Final ly, if \nyou're simply at odds, find a Mutual Purpose. \nNow we add one more skill: Explore Others' Paths. Since \nwe've added a model of what's going on inside another person's \nhead (the Path to Action), we now have a whole new tool for \nhelping others feel safe. If we can find a way to let others know \nthat it's okay to share their Path to Action-their facts, and yes,\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 43 \neven their nasty stories and ugly feelings-then they'll be more \nlikely to open up. \nBut what does it take? \nStart with Hear t-Get Ready to listen \nBe sin cere. To get at others' facts and stories, we have to invite \nthem to share what's on their minds. We'll look at how to do this \nin a minute. For now, let's highlight the point that when you do \ninvite people to share their views, you must mean it. For exam­\nple, consider the following incident. A patient is exiting a health­\ncare facility. The desk attendant can tell that she is a bit uneasy, \nmaybe even dissatisfied. \n\"Did everything go all right with the procedure?\" the clerk asks. \n\"Mostl y,\" the patient replies . (If ever there was a hint that \nsomething was wrong, the term \"mostly\" has to be it. ) \n\"Good,\" the clerk abruptly responds and then follows with a \nresounding, \"Next !\" \nThis is a classic case of pretending to be interested. It falls under \nthe \"How are you today?\" category of inquiries. Meaning : \"Please \ndon't say anything of substance. I'm really just making small talk.\" \nWhen you ask people to open up, be prepared to listen. \nBe curious. When you do want to hear from others (and you \nshould because it adds to the pool of meaning), the best way to get \nat the truth is by making it safe for them to express the stories that \nare moving them to either silence or violence. This means that at \nthe very moment when most people become furious, we need to \nbecome curious. Rather than respond in kind, we need to wonder \nwhat's behind the ruckus. \nBut how? How can we possibly act curious when others are \neit her attacking us or heading for cover? People who routinely \nseek to fi nd out why others are feeling unsafe have learned that \ngett ing at th e SOUl-ce or fear and di scomfort is the best way to\n\f\n14 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nreturn to dialogue. Either they've seen others do it, or they've \nstumbled on the formula themselves. In either case, they realize \nthat the cure to silence or violence isn't to respond in kind, but \nto get at the source. This calls for genuine curiosity-at a time \nwhen you're likely to be feeling frustrated or angry. \nTo help turn your visceral tendency to respond in kind into \ngenuine curiosi ty, look for opportunities to be curious. Start with \na situation where you observe someone becoming emotional and \nyou're still under control-such as a meeting (when you're not \npersonally under attack and are less likely to get hooked) . Do \nyour best to get at the person's source of fear or anger. Look for \nchances to tum on your curiosity rather than kick-start your \nadrenaline. \nTo illustrate what can happen as we exercise our curiosit y, let's \nreturn to our nervous patient. \nCLERK : Did everything go all right with the procedure? \nPATIENT: Mostl y. \nCLERK: It sounds like you had a problem of some kind. Is \nthat right? \nPATIENT: I'll say. It hurt quite a bit. And besides, isn't the \ndoctor, like, uh, way too old? \nIn this case, the patient is reluctant to speak up. Perhaps if \nshe shares her honest opinion, she will insult the doctor, or \nmaybe the loyal staff members will become offended. To deal \nwith the problem, the desk attendant lets the patient know \nthat it's safe to talk (as much with his tone as with his words ), \nand she opens up. \nStay curious. When people begin to share their volatile stories \nand feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, \nVi llain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they're say-\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 5 \ning what they're saying. Unfortunat ely, since it's rarely fun to \nhear other people's unflattering stories, we begin to assign nega­\ntive motives to them for telling the stories. For example: \nCLERK: Well aren't you the ungrateful one! The kind doctor \ndevotes his whole life to helping people and now that he's \na little gray around the edges, you want to send him out \nto pasture! \nTo avoid overreacting to others' stories, stay curious. Give \nyour brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: \"Why would a rea­\nsonable, rational, and decent person say this?\" This question \nkeeps you retracing the other person's Path to Action until you \nsee how it all fits together. And in most cases, you end up seeing \nthat under the circumstances, the individual in question drew a \nfairly reasonable conclusion. \nBe pa tient. When others are acting out their feelings and \nopinions through silence or violence, it's a good bet they're \nstarting to feel the effects of adrenaline. Even if we do our best \nto safely and effectively respond to the other person's possible \nonslaught, we still have to face up to the fact that it's going to \ntake a little while for him or her to settle down. Say, for exam­\nple, that a friend dumps out an ugly story and you treat it with \nrespect and continue on with the conversation. Even if the two \nof you now share a similar view, it may seem like your friend is \nstill pushing too hard. While it's natural to move quickly from \none thought to the next, strong emotions take a while to sub­\nside. Once the chemicals that fuel emotions are released, they \nhang around in the bloodstream for a time-in some cases, long \nafter thoughts have changed. \nSo be patient when exploring how others think and feel. \nEncourage them to share their path and then wait for their emo­\ntions to catch up with the safety that you've created."

They've seen and \nheard things, told themselves a story or two, generated a feeling \n(possibly a mix of fear and anger or disappointme nt), and now \nthey're starting to act out their story. That's where we come in. \nNow, even though we may be hearing their first words, we're \ncoming in somewhere near the end of their path. On the Path to \nAction model, we're seeing the action at the end of the path-as \nshown in Figure 8-1. \nEvery sentence has a history. To get a feel for how complicat­\ned and unnerving this process is, remember how you felt the last \ntime your favorite mystery show started late because a football \ngame ran long. As the game wraps up, the screen cross-fades \nfrom a trio of announcers to a starlet standing over a murder vic­\ntim. Along the bottom of the screen are the discomforting words, \n\"We now join this program already in progress.\" \n&eel TeU a \nHear ---too-Story --...,... Fee l \nFigure 8-1. The Path to Action\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 7 \nYou shake the remote in exasperation. You've missed the \nentire setup! For the rest of the program you end up guessing \nabout key facts. What happened before you joined in? \nCrucial conversations can be equally mysterious and frustrat­\ning. When others are in either silence or violence, we're actually \njoining their Path to Action already in progress. Consequently, \nwe've already missed the foundation of the story and we're con­\nfused. If we're not careful, we can become defensive. After all, \nnot only are we joining late, but we're also joining at a time when \nthe other person is starting to act offensively. \nBreak the cycle. And then guess what happens? When we're on \nthe receiving end of someone's retributions, accusations, and cheap \nshots, rarely do we think: \"M y, what an interesting story he or she \nmust have told. What do you suppose led to that?\" Instead, we \nmatch this unhealthy behavior. Our defense mechanisms kick in, \nand we create our own hasty and ugly Path to Action. \nPeople who know better cut this dangerous cycle by stepping \nout of the interaction and making it safe for the other person to \ntalk about his or her Path to Action. They perform this feat by \nencouraging him or her to move away from harsh feelings and \nknee-jerk reactions and toward the root cause. In essence, they \nretrace the other person's Path to Action together. At their \nencouragement, the other person moves from his or her emo­\ntions, to what he or she concluded, to what he or she observed. \nWhen we help others retrace their path to its origins, not only \ndo we help curb our reaction, but we also return to the place \nwhere the feelings can be resolved-at the source, or the facts \nand the story behind the emotion. \nPOWER UP \nWhen? So far we've suggested that when other people appear to \nhave a story to tel l and facts to share, it's our job to invite them"

    "raw_text": "14 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nto do so. Our cues are simple: Others are going to silence or vio­\nlence. We can see that they're feeling upset, fearful, or angry. We \ncan see that if we don't get at the source of their feelings, we'll \nend up suffering the effects of the feelings. These external reac­\ntions are our cues to do whatever it takes to help others retrace \ntheir Paths to Action. \nHow? We've also suggested that whatever we do to invite the \nother person to open up and share his or her path, our invitation \nmust be sincere. As hard as it sounds, we must be sincere in the \nface of hostility, fear, or even abuse-which leads us to the next \nquestion. \nWhat? What are we supposed to actually do? What does it \ntake to get others to share their path-stories and facts alike? In \na word, it requires listening. In order for people to move from \nacting on their feelings to talking about their conclusions and \nobservations, we must listen in a way that makes it safe for oth­\ners to share their intimate thoughts. They must believe that when \nthey share their thoughts, they won't offend others or be pun­\nished for speaking frankly. \nAMPP \nTo encourage others to share their paths we'll use four power lis­\ntening tools that can help make it safe for other people to speak \nfrankly. We call the four skills power listening tools because they \nare best remembered with the acronym AMPP- Ask, Mirror, \nParaphrase, and Prime. Luckily, the tools work for both silence \nand violence games. \nAsk to Get Th in gs Ro lling \nThe easiest and most straightforward way to encourage others to \nshare their Path to Action is simply to invite them to express them­\nselves. For example, often all it takes to break an impasse is to seek\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 14 9 \nto understand others' views. When we show genuine interest, peo­\nple feel less compelled to use silence or violence. For example: \"Do \nyou like my new dress, or are you going to call the modesty \npolice?\" Wendy smirks. \n\"What do you mean?\" you ask. \"I'd like to hear your concerns.\" \nIf you're willing to step out of the fray and simply invite the \nother person to talk about what's really going on, it can go a long \nway toward breaking the downward spiral and getting to the \nsource of the problem. \nCommon invitations include: \n\"What's going on?\" \n\"I'd really like to hear your opinion on this.\" \n\"Please let me know if you see it differently.\" \n\"Don't worry about hurting my feelings. I really want to \nhear your thoughts.\" \nMi rror to Confirm Feelings \nIf asking others to share their path doesn't open things up, mirror­\ning can help build more safety. In mirroring, we take the portion of \nthe other person's Path to Action we have access to and make it \nsafe for him or her to discuss it. All we have so far are actions and \nsome hints about the other person's emotions, so we start there. \nWhen we mirror, as the name sugg ests, we hold a mirror up \nto the other person-describing how they look or act. Although \nwe may not understand others' stories or facts, we can see their \nactions and get clues about their feelings. \nThis particular tool is most useful when another person's tone \nor voice or gestures (hints about the emotions behind them) are \ninconsistent with his or her words. For example: \"Don't worry. \nI' m fine.\" (But the person in question is saying this with a look \nt hat suggests he is actually quite upset. He's frowning, looking \naround, and sort of kicking at the ground.)\n\f\n1 50 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n\"Really? From the way you're saying that, it doesn't sound like \nyou are.\" \nWe explain that while the person may be saying one thing, his \nor her tone of voice or body posture suggests something else. In \ndoing so, we show respect and concern for him or her. \nThe most important element of mirroring is our tone of voice. \nIt is not the fact that we are acknowledging others' emotions that \ncreates safety. We create safety when our tone of voice says we're \nokay with them feeling the way they're feeling. If we do this well, \nthey may conclude that rather than acting out their emotions, \nthey can confidently talk them out with us instead. \nSo as we describe what we see, we have to do so calmly. If we \nact upset or as if we're not going to like what others say, we don't \nbuild safety. We confirm their suspicions that they need to \nremain silent. \nExamples of mirroring include: \n\"You say you're okay, but by the tone of your voice, you \nseem upset.\" \n\"You seem angry at me. \" \n\"You look nervous about confronting him. Are you sure \nyou're willing to do it?\" \n�a raph rase to Acknow ledge the Story \nAsking and mirroring may help you get part of the other person's \nstory out into the open. When you get a clue about why the per­\nson is feeling as he or she does, you can build additional safety \nby paraphrasing what you've heard. Be careful not to simply par­\nrot back what was said. Instead, put the message in your own \nwords-us ually in an abbreviated form . \n\"Let's see if I've got this right. You're upset because I've \nvoiced my concern about some of the clothes you wear. And \nthis seems controlling or old-fashioned to you.\"\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 51 \nThe key to paraphrasing, as with mirroring, is to remain calm \nand collected. Our goal is to make it safe, not to act horrified and \nsuggest that the conversation is about to tum ugly. Stay focused \non figuring out how a reasonable, rational, and decent person \ncould have created this Path to Action . This will help you keep \nfrom becoming angry or defensive. Simply rephrase what the per­\nson has said, and do it in a way that suggests that it's okay, you're \ntrying to understand, and it's safe for him or her to talk candidly. \nDon 't push too hard. Let's see where we are. We can tell that \nanother person has more to share than he or she is currently \nsharing. He or she is going to silence or violence, and we want \nto know why. We want to get back to the source (the fact s) \nwhere we can solve the problem. To encourage the person to \nshare, we've tried three listening tools. We've asked, mirrored, \nand paraphrased. The person is still upset, but isn't explaining \nhis or her stories or facts. \nNow what? At this point, we may want to back off. After a \nwhile, our attempts to make it safe for others can start feeling as \nif we're pestering or prying. If we push too hard, we violate both \npurpose and respect. Others may think our purpose is merely to \nextract what we want from them and conclude that we don't care \nabout them personally. So instead, we back off. Rather than try­\ning to get to the source of the other person's emotions, we either \ngracefully exit or ask what he or she wants to see happen. Asking \npeople what they want helps them engage their brains in a way \nthat moves to problem solving and away from either attacking or \navoiding. It also helps reveal what they think the cause of the \nproblem is. \nfrime When You'r e Getti ng Nowher e \nOn the other hand, there are times when you may conclude that \nothers would like to open up but still don't feel safe. Or maybe \nthey're still in viole nce, haven 't come down from the adrenaline,\n\f\n15 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nand aren't explaining why they're angry. When this is the case, \nyou might want to try priming. Prime when you believe that the \nother person still has something to share and might do so with a \nlittle more effort on your part. \nThe power-listening term priming comes from the expression \n\"priming the pump.\" If you've ever worked an old-fashioned \nhand pump, you understand the metaphor. Wi th a pump, you \noften have to pour some water into it to get it running. Then it \nworks just fine. When it comes to power listening, sometimes \nyou have to offer your best guess at what the other person is \nthinking or feeling. You have to pour some meaning into the \npool before the other person will do the same. \nA few years back, one of the authors was working with an \nexecutive team that had decided to add an afternoon shift to one \nof the company's work areas. The machinery wasn't being fully \nutilized, and the company couldn't afford to keep the area open \nwithout adding a three-to-midnight crew. This, of course, meant \nthat the people currently working days would now have to rotate \nevery two weeks to afternoons. It was a tortured but necessary \nchoice. \nAs the execs held a meeting to announce the unpopular \nchange, the existing work crew went silent. They were obviously \nunhappy, but nobody would say anything. The operations man­\nager was afraid that people would misinterpret the company's \nactions as nothing more than a grab for more money. In truth, \nthe area was losing money, but the decision was made with the \ncurrent employees in mind. With no second shift, there would be \nno jobs . He also knew that asking people to rotate shifts and to \nbe away from loved ones during the afternoon and evening \nwould cause horrible burdens. \nAs people sat silently fuming, the executive did his best to get \nthem to talk so that they wouldn't walk away with unresolved \nfeelings. He mirrored, \"I can see you're upset-who wouldn't\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 53 \nbe? Is there anything we can do?\" Nothing. Finally, he primed. \nThat is, he took his best guess at what they might be thinking, \nsaid it in a way that showed it was okay to talk about it, and then \nwent on from there. \"Are you thinking that the only reason we're \ndoing this is to make money? Tha t maybe we don't care about \nyour personal lives?\" \nAfter a brief pause, someone answered: \"Well, it sure looks \nlike that. Do you have any idea how much trouble this is going \nto cause?\" Then someone else chimed in and the discussion was \noff and running. \nNow, this is not the kind of thing you would do unless noth­\ning else has worked. You really want to hear from others, and \nyou have a very strong idea of what they're probably thinking. \nPriming is an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming vulnera­\nble, and building safety in hopes that others will share their \nmeaning. \nBut What If They're Wrong? \nSometimes it feels dangerous to sincerely explore the views of \nsomeone whose path is wildly different from your own. He or \nshe could be completely wrong, and we're acting calm and col­\nlected. This makes us nervous. \nTo keep ourselves from feeling nervous while exploring others' \npaths-no matter how different or wrong they seem-remember \nwe're trying to understand their point of view, not necessarily \nagree with it or support it. Understanding doesn't equate with \nagreement. By coming to understand another person's Path to \nAction, we are not accepting it as absolute truth. There will be \nplenty of time later for us to share our path as well. For now , \nwc're merely trying to get at what others think in order to under­\nstand why they're feeling the way they're feeling and doing what \nth ey 'r c doing.\n\f\n1 54 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nEXPLORING WEN DY'S PATH \nNow let's put the several skills together in a single interaction. We'll \nreturn to Wendy. She has just come home from a date with the guy \nwho has you frightened. You yank the door open, pull Wendy into \nthe house, and double-bolt your entrance. Then you talk, sort of. \nWENDY: How could you embarrass me like that! 1 get one \nboy to like me, and now he'll never talk to me again! 1 \nhate you! \nYou: That wasn't a boy. That was a future inmate. You're \nworth more than that. Why are you wasting your time \nwith him? \nWENDY: You're ruining my life. Leave me alone! \nAfter Wendy's bedroom door slams shut, you drop down \ninto a chair in the living room. Your emotions are running \nwild. You're terrified about what could happen if Wendy con­\ntinues to see this guy. You're hurt that she said she hated you. \nYou feel that your relationship with her is spiraling out of \ncontrol. \nSo you ask yourself, \"What do 1 really want?\" As you mull this \nquestion over, your motives change. The goals of controlling \nWendy and defending your pride drop from the top to the bottom \nof your list. The goal that's now at the top looks a bit more inspir­\ning: \"I want to understand what she's feeling. 1 want a good rela­\ntionship with Wendy. And I want her to make choices that will \nmake her happy.\" \nYou're not sure if tonight is the best or worst time to talk, but you \nknow that talking is the only path forward. So you give it a shot. \nYou: (Tapping on door.) Wendy? May I talk with you \nplease? \nWENDY: Whatever.\n\f\nEXPLORE OTHERS' PATHS 1 55 \n(You enter her room and sit on her bed. ) \nYOU: I'm really sorry for embarrassing you like that. That \nwas a bad way to handle it. [Apologize to build safety] \nWENDY: It's just that you do that a lot. It's like you want to \ncontrol everything in my life . \nYOU: Can we talk about that? [Ask] \nWENDY: (Sounding angry) It's no big deal. You're the par­\nent, right? \nYOU: From the way you say that, it sounds like it is a big \ndeal. [Mirror] I really would like to hear what makes you \nthink I'm trying to control your life. [Ask] \nWENDY: What, so you can tell me more ways that I'm \nscrewed up? I've finally got one friend who accepts me, \nand you're trying to chase him away! \nYOU: So you feel like I don't approve of you, and your friend \nis one person who does? [Paraphrase] \nWENDY: It's not just you. All my friends have lots of boys \nwho like them. Doug's the first guy who's even called me. \nI don't know-never mind. \nYOU: I can see how you'd feel badly when others are getting \nattention from boys and you aren't. I'd probably feel the \nsame way. [Paraphrase] \nWENDY: Then how could you embarra ss me like that? ! \nYOU: Honey, I'd like to take a stab at something here. I won­\nder if part of the reason you've started dressing differently \nand hanging out with different friends is because you're \nnot feeling cared about and valued by boys, by your par­\nents, and by others right now. Is that part of it? [Prime] \nWEN DY: (Sits quietl y for a long time) Why am I so ugly? I \nreally work on how I look but ...\n\f\n15 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nFrom here, the conversation goes to the real issues, parent and \ndaughter discuss what's really going on, and both come to a better \nunderstanding of each other. \nREMEM BER YOUR ABCs \nLet's say you did your level best to make it safe for the other per­\nson to talk. After asking, mirroring, paraphrasing, and eventually \npriming, the other person opened up and shared his or her path. \nIt's now your turn to talk. But what if you disagree? Some of the \nother person's facts are wrong, and his or her stories are com­\npletely fouled up. Well, at least they're a lot different from the \nstory you've been telling. Now what? \nAgree \nAs you watch families and work groups take part in heated \ndebates, it's common to notice a rather intriguing phenomenon. \nAlthough the various parties you're observing are violently argu­\ning, in truth, they're in violent agreement. They actually agree on \nevery important point, but they're still fighting. They've found a \nway to turn subtle differences into a raging debate. \nFor example, last night your teenage son broke his curfew \nagain. You and your spouse have spent the morning arguing \nabout the infraction. Last time James came in late, you agreed to \nground him, but today you're upset because it seems like your \nspouse is backpedaling by suggesting that James still be able to \nattend a football camp this week. Tu rns out it was just a misun­\nderstanding. You and your spouse agree to the grounding-the \ncentral issue. You thought your spouse was reneging on the agree­\nment when, in truth, you just hadn't actually resolved the date the \ngrounding would start. You had to step back and listen to what"

And while it's true \nthat people eventually need to work through differences, you \nshouldn't start there. Start with an area of agreement. \nSo here's the take-away. If you completely agree with the \nother person's path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. \nDon't turn an agreement into an argument. \nRuild \nOf course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is \nbecause we disagree with a certain portion of what the other per­\nson has said. Never mind that it's a minor portion. If it's a point \nof disagreement, we'll jump all over it like a fleeing crimi nal. \nActually, we're trained to look for minor errors from an early \nage. For instance, we learn in kindergarten that if you have the \nright answer, you're the teacher's pet. Being right is good. Of \ncourse, if others have the right answer they get to be the pet. So \nbeing right first is even better. You learn to look for even the tini­\nest of errors in others' facts, thinking, or logic. Then you point \nout the errors. Being right at the expense of others is best. \nBy the time you finish your education, you have a virtual \nPh.D. in catching trivial differences and turning them into a \nmajor deal. So when another person offers up a suggestion \n(based on facts and stories), you're looking to disagree. And \nwhen you do find a minor difference, you turn this snack into a \nmeal. Instead of remaining in healthy dialogue, you end up in \nviolent agreement. \nOn the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in \ndialogue, it becomes clear that they're not playing this everyday"

It's the one thing that helps \npeople make savvy decisions that, in turn, lead to smart actions. \nIn order to encourage this free flow of meaning, we've shared the \nskills we've been able to learn by watching people who are gift­\ned at dialogue. By now, if you've followed some or all of this \nadvice, you're walking around with full pools. People who walk \nnear you should hear the sloshing. \nIt's time we add two final skills. Having more meaning in the \npool. even jointly owning it, doesn't guarantee that we all agree \non what we're going to do with the meaning. For example, when \nIl!ums or families meet and generate a host of ideas, they often \nfail to convert the ideas into action for two reasons:\n\f\n16 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n• They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be \nmade. \n• They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make. \nThis can be dangerous. In fact, when people move from adding \nmeaning to the pool to moving to action, it's a prime time for new \nchallenges to arise. Who is supposed to take the assignment? \nThat can be controversial. How are we supposed to decide in the \nfirst place? That can be emotional. Let's take a look at what it \ntakes to solve each of these problems. First, making decisions. \nDIALOG UE IS NOT DEC ISION MAKI NG \nThe two riskiest times in crucial conversations tend to be at the \nbeginning and at the end. The beginning is risky because you \nhave to find a way to create safety or else things go awry. The end \nis dicey because if you aren't careful about how you clarify the \nconclusion and decisions flowing from your Pool of Shared \nMeaning, you can run into violated expectations later on. This \ncan happen in two ways. \nHow are decisions going to be made? First, people may not \nunderstand how decisions are going to be made. For example, \nCara is miffed. Rene just plunked down a brochure for a three­\nday cruise and announced he had made reservations and even \npaid the five hundred dollar deposit for an outside suite. \nA week ago they had a crucial conversation about vacation \nplans. Both expressed their views and preferences respectfully \nand candidly. It wasn't easy, but at the end they concluded a \ncruise suited both quite well. And yet Cara is miffed, and Rene \nis stunned that Cara is anything less than ecstatic. \nCara agreed in principle about a cruise. She didn't agree with \nthis particular cruise. Rene thought that any cruise would be fine \nand made a decision on his own. Have fun on the cruise. Rene."

    "raw_text": "MOVE TO ACTION 16 3 \nAre we ever going to decide ? The second problem with deci­\nsion making occurs when no decision gets made. Either ideas \nslip away and dissipate, or people can't figure out what to do \nwith them. Or maybe everyone is waiting for everyone else to \nmake the decisio ns. \"H ey, we filled the pool. Now you do some­\nthing with it .\" In any case, decisions drag on forever. \nDECIDE HOW TO DECIDE \nBoth of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, \nthe people involved decide how to decide. Don't allow people to \nassume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process \nfor getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, \nof course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone \nis allowed to share their meaning-actually encouraged to share \ntheir meaning-doesn't mean they are then guaranteed to take \npart in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, \nseparate dialogue from decision making. Make it clear how deci­\nsions will be made-who will be involved and why. \nWhen the line of authority is clear. When you're in a position \nof authority, you decide which method of decision making you'll \nuse. Managers and parents, for example, decide how to decide. It's \npart of their responsibility as leaders. For instance, VPs don't ask \nhourly employees to decide on pricing changes or product lines. \nTha t's the leaders' job. Parents don't ask small children to pick \ntheir home security device or to set their own curfew. That's the \njob of the parent. Of course, both leaders and parents tum more \ndecisions over to their direct reports and children when they war­\nrant the responsibility, but it's still the authority figure who decides \nwhat method of decision making to employ. Deciding what deci­\nsions to tum over and when to do it is part of their stewardship. \nWhen the line of aut hority isn 't clear. When there is no clear \nli ne of aut hority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult.\n\f\n16 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nFor instance, consider a conversation we referred to earlier-the \none you had with your daughter's schoolteacher. Should you hold \nyour child back? Whose choice is this anyway? Who decides \nwhose choice it is? Does everyone have a say, then a vote? Is it \nthe school officials' responsibility, so they choose? Since parents \nhave ultimate responsibility, should they consult with the appro­\npriate experts and then decide? Is there even a clear answer to \nthis tough question? \nA case like this is hand-tooled for dialogue. All of the partici­\npants need to get their meaning into the pool-including their \nopinions about who should make the final choice. That's part of \nthe meaning you need to discuss. If you don't openly talk about \nwho decides and why, and your opinions vary widely, you're like­\nly to end up in a heated battle that can only be resolved in court. \nHandled poorly, that's exactly where these kind of issues are \nresolved-T he l ones Family vs. Happy Valley School District. \nSo what's a person to do? Talk openly about your child's abil­\nities and interests as well as about how the final choice will be \nmade. Don't mention lawyers or a lawsuit in your opening com­\nments; this only reduces safety and sets up an adversarial cli­\nmate. Your goal is to have an open, honest, and healthy discus­\nsion about a child, not to exert your influence, make threats, or \nsomehow beat the educators. Stick with the opinions of the \nexperts at hand, and discuss how and why they should be \ninvolved. When decision-making authority is unclear, use your \nbest dialogue skills to get meaning into the pool. Jointly decide \nhow to decide. \nThe Four Methods of Decision Making \nWhen you're deciding how to decide, it helps to have a way of \ntalking about the decision-making options available. There are \nfour common ways of making decisions : command, consult,"

Increased involvement, of course, brings \nthe benefit of increased commitment along with the curse of \ndecreased decision-making efficiency. Savvy people choose from \namong these four methods of decision making the one that best \nsuits their particular circumstances. \nComm and \nLet's start with decisions that are made with no involvement what­\nsoever. This happens in one of two ways. Either outside forces \nplace demands on us (demands that leave us no wiggle room), or \nwe tum decisions over to others and then follow their lead. We \ndon't care enough to be involved-let someone else do the work. \nIn the case of external forces, customers set prices, agencies \nmandate safety standards, and other governing bodies simply \nhand us demands. As much as employees like to think their boss­\nes are sitting around making choices, for the most part they're \nsimply passing on the demands of the circumstances. These are \ncommand decisions. With command decisions, it's not our job to \ndecide what to do. It's our job to decide how to make it work. \nIn the case of turning decisions over to others, we decide \neither that this is such a low-stakes issue that we don't care \nenough to take part or that we completely trust the ability of the \ndelegate to make the right decision. More involvement adds \nnothing. In strong teams and great relationships, many decisions \nare made by turning the final choice over to someone we trust to \nmake a good decision. We don't want to take the time ourselves \nand gladly tum the decision over to others. \nConsu lt \nConsulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to \ninfluenec them before they make their choice. You can consult\n\f\n16 6 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nwith experts, a representative population, or even everyone who \nwants to offer an opinion. Consulting can be an efficient way of \ngaining ideas and support without bogging down the decision­\nmaking process. At least not too much. Wise leaders, parents, \nand even couples frequently make decisions in this way. They \ngather ideas, evaluate options, make a choice, and then inform \nthe broader population. \nVote \nVo ting is best suited to situations where efficiency is the highest \nvalue-and you're selecting from a number of good options. \nMembers of the team realize they may not get their first choice, \nbut frankly they don't want to waste time talking the issue to \ndeath. They may discuss options for a while and then call for a \nvote. When facing several decent options, voting is a great time \nsaver but should never be used when team members don't agree \nto support whatever decision is made. In these cases, consensus \nis required. \nCo nsensus \nThis method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. \nConsensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one \ndecision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high­\nquality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of \ntime. It should only be used with (1) high-stakes and complex \nissues or (2) issues where everyone absolutely must support the \nfinal choice. \nHOW TO CHOOSE \nNow that we know the four methods, let's explore which method \nto use at which time- along with some hints about how to avoid \ncommon blunders.\n\f\nMOVE TO ACTION 16 7 \nFour Im portant Questions \nWhen choosing among the four methods of decision making, \nconsider the following questions. \n1. Who cares? Determine who genuinely wants to be involved \nin the decision along with those who will be affected. These \nare your candidates for involvement. Don't involve people \nwho don't care. \n2. Who knows ? Identify who has the expertise you need to \nmake the best decision. Encourage these people to take \npart. Try not to involve people who contribute no new \ninformation. \n3. Who must agree? Think of those whose cooperation you \nmight need in the form of authority or influence in any \ndecisions you might make. It's better to involve these \npeople than to surprise them and then suffer their open \nresistance. \n4. How many people is it worth involving? Your goal should \nbe to involve the fewest number of people while still con­\nsidering the quality of the decision along with the support \nthat people will give it. Ask: \"Do we have enough people to \nmake a good choice? Will others have to be involved to \ngain their commitm ent?\" \nHow about you? Here's a suggestion for a great exercise for \nteams or couples, particularly those that are frustrated about \ndecision making. Make a list of some of the important decisions \nmade in the team or relationship. Then discuss how each deci­\nsion is currently made, and how each should be made-usi ng the \nfour im portant questions. After discus sing each decision, decide \nhow you wi ll make decisions in the future. A crucial conversa­\ntion a bout your decision-makin g practices can resolve many frus­\nIruling issues."

    "raw_text": "16 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nDE CISI ON-M AKI NG BLUND ERS AND SOLUTI ONS \nNow, let's look at each of the four methods in turn. What are the \ncommon blunders associated with each, and more importantly, \nhow can we avoid them? \nAppropriate Use of Com mand \nThe mistake. For years, employees have complained that their \nbosses are far too bossy. They hand out orders like Halloween \ncandy. They not only tell people what to do, but also restrict \nthem to only one way of doing it. They give directions down to \nthe tiniest detail when it would be better to allow the employee \nto work out the details of how the job will be done. After all, the \nemployee is not only closest to the job, but is also the expert on \nhow to do it. \nTo day's generation of employees (and children, for that mat­\nter) expects to be involved in more decisions than their grand­\nparents ever faced. That's where the empowerment movement \ncame from . Younger people don't see themselves as a pair of \nhands seeking direction. They want to think. They want to \ndecide. The y're willing to take on more responsibility. \nSo as you face a potential \"command decision,\" consider the \nfollowing: \n• Don 't pass out orders like candy. We face enough command \ndecisions (constraints placed on us by outside forces) without \nmaking up new ones. As a general rule, if people can make choic­\nes, allow them to do so. Don't tie their hands without reason. \nWith kids, for example, you may establish rules about cleanliness \nin the common areas of the home, but you may let them choose \n(within the boundaries of hygiene) how to keep their rooms. \n• When you face a command decision, ask which elements are \nflexible. Once a standard has been set by an agency or an order\n\f\nMOVE TO ACTION 16 9 \nplaced by a customer, while you may not be able to decide what \nto work on or what standards to follow, you can decide how to \nwork. Find out where you do have degrees of freedom and then \nallow others to choose within these boundaries . \n• Explain why. When handing down an order, explain the reason \nbehind the demand. Knowing why helps make what a lot eas­\nier. For example, if you decide overtime is needed to meet a \ndeadline, it helps to explain why you came to this conclusion. \nThe Dos and Don' ts of Consultation \nThe most obvious problem with consultation is that people \nbelieve that if you involve them in sharing ideas, they get to make \nthe decision. It's easy to see how this happens since you ask for \npeople's input, you weigh all the options, and you make a deci­\nsion. Then two-thirds of those you asked feel violated because \nyou didn't do what they told you to do. \nDialogue is a great tool for consultation. It enables you to get \nall meaning into the shared pool. But before people start con­\ntributing, be sure they understand that the fact that you are con­\nsulting with them does not mean that eventually the decision will \nbe made by consensus. \nWhen should you use consultation? Consult when (1) many \npeople will be affected, (2) you can gather information relative­\nIy easily, (3) people care about the decision, and (4) there are \nmany options, some of them controversial. \nWhen these conditions apply, find a way to touch base with a \nlot of people in different positions, locations, and functions \nbefore moving on. Don't simply call on your friends and buddies. \nAlso, consider the following: \n• J)on ', pretend to consult. If you've already made up your \nmind, don 't go through the charade of involving people, only\n\f\n17 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nto do what you wanted to do all along. For example, the boss \ncalls on people and then strikes down ideas that aren't in line \nwith what he or she has in mind, while giving subtle clues and \ngentle rewards to those who stumble onto the \"right idea .\" \n• Anno unce what you 're doing. When you are only going to \ninvolve a sample of the people who will be affected, let others \nknow who these people are so they can talk to them if they \nlike. This is akin to holding neighborhood political meetings. \nNot everyone will show up, but people who want to take part \ncan take part. \n• Report your decision. When others are kind enough to share \ntheir opinions (whether you take their advice or not), they \ndeserve to know what you decide and why. Don't try to keep \nyour decision a secret because you're afraid you'll offend peo­\nple. The y'll soon learn of the decision anyway. Better to hear \nit from you and not through the grapevine. \nHolding a Good Vote \n• Weigh the consequenc es. Vo ting by its very nature creates \nwinners and losers. So you have to be careful. You should only \ntake a vote when you know that the losers don't really care all \nthat much. Otherwise you may be fighting the battle for a long \ntime after the decision has been made. With children, for \nexample, have them carefully consider if they're okay with los­\ning before they agree to have you take a poll. \n• Know when to vote. When matters aren't all that weighty, there \nare many good choices to select from, and people care about \nnot taking too much time, then take a vote. It's the kind of thing \nyou do to reduce lengthy lists. Vote to reduce the list of twenty \nitems to five. Then use consensus to select from the five."

If you find yourself say­\ning, \"All right, we'll never agree so let's vote,\" you're copping \nout. \nSurviving the Joys of Consensus \nImagine you're working with six people, all housed in a tight \nspace.

People apply it to situa­\ntions that don't deserve the time and attention needed to come \nto a consensus or that can't be solved unanimously. \nFor example, forty people are brought together to decide on \nthe color of the work area. That's too many people. Use con­\nsultation. A team meets to decide if each team member should \nuse a certain type of coffee mug (we're not making this up) . \nLet people choose their own. A couple asks their son to decide \nhis own punishment. Not always a good idea. Some decisions \nneed to be made by command. \n• Don 't pretend that everyone gets his or her first choice. Nobody \never said that with consensus everyone gets his or her way. \nConsensus isn't about getting your way; it's about doing what's \nbest for the family or team. It requires give and take. It demands \ncompromise followed by the resolve to support (in some cases) \nyour second or third choice-because it's best for the group. \n• No martyrs please. Healthy teams and families are good at \ncoming to consensus because they're good at dialogue. They \ndon't toggle from silence to violence or otherwise play games \nin order to get their way. Since everyone has a say and says it \nwell, healthy groups don't end up with the same people con­\nstantly giving in and then playing the role of mar tyr. \"Are you \nenjoying the theme park? Don't worry about me. I'll just sit \nhere on the curb and try to think of what it would have been \nlike to go to Paris.\" \n• Don 't take turns. Decisions should be based on merit, not on \nwho offers up the options. Don't take turns getting your way. \n\"Well, Leona, my recollection is that you gave in last time, so \nI guess it's our turn to roll over on this one.\" Make the deci­\nsion based on which proposal best meets the needs of the\n\f\nMOVE TO ACTION 17 3 \ngroup. This doesn't mean that people don't take into account \npersonalities or strength of desire (deferring to those who care \na great deal when you don't care all that much, for instance) . \nIt simply means that the future of your family or organization \nshouldn't come down to the flip of a coin. \n• Don 't engage in postdecision lobbying. Consensus decisions \nshould be made out in the open and as an entire group. \nWithholding your reservations and then approaching individu­\nals after the discussion is both inefficient and disloyal. If you \nhave an issue, bring it up in front of the group. Leave unhealthy \nalliances, dirty deals, and secret discussions to people who are \non reality game shows. They can afford to abuse one another, \ntake their winnings, and then go their separate ways. With fam­\nilies and work groups, you stay together long after the ugly \nbehavior and you suffer the long-term consequences . \n• Don 't say «[ told you so. \" Nothing is quite so annoying as \nhaving someone agree on a choice (his or her second choice, \nperhaps) and then cry, \"I told you so!\" when it doesn't work \nout. Once you've decided on something as a group, support \nthe idea-not even when it fails, but particularly when it fails. \nThere's no room for fair-weather family members or team­\nmates. Show character. When an idea doesn't work out, own \nthe failure together. \nAdvice for the Time-Bou nd \nThere are times when you know you should involve others in a \ndecision, but you absolutely have to make a decision by a certain \ntime. Tn these cases, consider selecting a fallback decision-making \nplan. \nFor example, you could announce: \"W e have a critical deci­\nsion 10 mak e that af fe ct s all of us, and it must be made by ten"

You've engaged in healthy \ndialogue, filled the pool of meaning, decided how you're going \nto draw from the pool, and eventually come to some decisions . \nIt's time to do something. Some of the items may have been \ncompletely resolved during the discussion, but many may \nrequire a person or team to do something. You'll have to make \nassignmen ts. \nAs you might suspect, when you're involved with two or more \npeople, there's a chance that there will be some confusion. To \navoid common traps, make sure you consider the following four \nelements: \n• Who? \n• Does what? \n• By when? \n• How will you follow up? \nWho ? \nTo quote an English proverb, \"Everybody's business is nobody's \nbusiness .\" If you don't make an actual assignment to an actual \nperson, there's a good chance that nothing will ever come of all \nthe work you've gone through to make a decision.\n\f\nMOVE TO ACTION 1 75 \nWhen it's time to pass out assignments, rememb er, there is no \n\"we.\" \"We,\" when it comes to assignments, actually means, \"not \nme .\" It's code. Even when individuals are not trying to duck an \nassignment, the term \"we\" can lead them to believe that others \nare taking on the responsibility. \nAssi gn a name to every responsibility. This especially applies \nat home. If you're divvying up household chores, be sure you've \ngot a specific person to go with each chore. That is, if you assign \ntwo or three people to take on a task, appoint one of them the \nresponsible party. Otherwise, any sense of responsibility will be \nlost in a flurry of finger-pointing later on. \nDoes What ? \nBe sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The \nfuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappoint­\nment. For example, the eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes \nonce assigned a team of engineers to design and build the world's \nfirst steam-powered car. When sharing his dream of a vehicle that \ncould run on heated water, he gave them virtually no direction. \nAfter several years of intense labor the engineers successfully \nproduced the first prototype by running dozens of pipes through \nthe car's body-thus solving the problem of where to put all the \nwater required to run a steam-powered car. The vehicle was \nessentially a giant radiator. \nWhen Hughes asked the engineers what would happen if the \ncar got into a wreck, they nervously explained that the passen­\ngers would be boiled alive, much like lobsters in a pot. Hughes \nwas so upset in what the crew came up with that he insisted they \ncut it up into pieces no larger than three inches. That was the \ncnd of the project. \nLcarn from Hughes. When you're first agreeing on an assign­\nmcnt, c la rify up front the exact details of what you want."

Have you ever remodeled a room \nwith a loved one? Then you know what we're talking about. \nBetter to spend the time up front clarifying exactly what you want \nrather than waste resources and hurt feelings on the back end. \nTo help clarify deliverables, use Contrasting. If you've seen \npeople misunderstand an assignment in the past, explain the \ncommon mistak e as an example of what you don't want. If pos­\nsible, point to physical examples. Rather than talk in the \nabstract, bring a prototype or sample. We learned this particular \ntrick when hiring a set designer. The renowned designer talked \nabout what he would deliver, and it sounded great to us. Tw enty­\nfive thousand dollars later he delivered something that would \nnever work. We had to start over from scratch. From that day on \nwe've learned to point to pictures and talk about what we want \nand don't want. The clearer the picture of the deliverable, the \nless likely you'll be unpleasantly surprised. \nBy When? \nIt's shocking how often people leave this element out of an \nassignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to \nthe setting sun of \"someday.\" With vague or unspoken deadlines, \nother urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the \nbottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments with­\nout deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating \naction. Goals without deadlines aren't goals; they're merely \ndirections. \nHo w Will You Fo llow Up ? \nAlways agree on how often and by what method you'll follow up \non the assignment. It could be a simple ema il confirming the\n\f\nMOVE TO ACTION 17 7 \ncompletion of a project. It might be a full report in a team or \nfamily meeting. More often than not, it comes down to progress \nchecks along the way. \nIt's actually fairly easy to build follow-up methods into the \nassignment. For example: \"Call me on my cell phone when you \nfinish your homework. Then you can go play with friends. \nOkay?\" \nOr perhaps you'll prefer to rely on milestones: \"Let me know \nwhen you've completed your library research. Then we'll sit down \nand look at the next steps.\" Milestones, of course, must be linked \nto a drop-dead date. \"Let me know as soon you've completed the \nresearch component of this project. You've got until the last week \nin Novemb er, but if you finish earlier, give me a call.\" \nRemember, if you want people to feel accountable, you must \ngive them an opportunity to account. Build an expectation for \nfollow-up into every assignment. \nDOCU MEN T YOUR WORK \nOnce again, a proverb comes to mind. \"One dull pencil is worth \nsix sharp minds.\" Don't leave your hard work to memory. If \nyou've gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, \ndon't fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your \nmemori es. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and \nassignments. Remember to record who does what by when. \nRevi sit your notes at key times (usually the next meeting) and \nreview assignments. \nAs you review what was supposed to be completed, hold peo­\nple accountable. When someone fails to deliver on a promi se, it's \ntime for dialogue. Discuss the issue by using the STAT E skills we \ncovered in Chapter 7. By holding people accountable, not only \ndo you increase their motivation and ability to deliver on prom­\nises. but you create a cult ure of integrity.\n\f\n17 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nSUM MARY- MOVE TO ACTION \nTurn your successful crucial conversations into great decisions \nand united action by avoiding the two traps of violated expecta­\ntions and inaction. \nDecide How to Decide \n• Command .

And then they try something to \nget back to dialogue. As it turns out, trying something is better \nthan doing nothing. \nSo remember to ask the following important question: \"Are \nwe playing games or are we in dialogue?\" It's a wonderful start. \nMany people get additional help in learning to look from their \nfriends. They go through training as families or teams. As they \nshare concepts and ideas, they learn a common vocabulary. This \nshared way of talking about crucial conversations helps people \nchange. \nPerhaps the most common way that the language of dialogue \nfinds itself into everyday conversation is with the expression, \"I\n\f\nPUITING IT ALL TOGETHER 181 \nthink we've moved away from dialogue.\" This simple reminder \nhelps people catch themselves early on, before the damage is severe. \nAs we've watched executive teams, work groups, and couples sim­\nply go public with the fact that they're starting to move toward \nsilence or violence, others often recognize the problem and take \ncorrective action. \"You're right. I'm not telling you what needs to \nbe said,\" or \"I'm sorry. I have been trying to force my ideas on you.\" \nMake It Safe. The second lever is Make It Safe. We've sug­\ngested that dialogue consists of the free flow of meaning and that \nthe number one flow stopper is a lack of safety. When you notice \nthat you and others have moved away from dialogue, do some­\nthing to make it safer. Anything. We've suggested a few skills, \nbut those are merely a handful of common practices. Th ey're not \nim mutable principles. To no one's surprise, there many things \nyou can do to increase safety. If you simply realize that your chal­\nlenge is to make it safer, nine out of ten times you'll intuitively \ndo something that helps. \nSometimes you'll build safety by asking a question and show­\ning interest in others' views. Sometimes an appropriate touch \n(with loved ones and family members-not at work where \ntouching can equate with harassment) can communicate safety. \nApologies, smiles, even a request for a brief \"time out\" can help \nrestore safety when things get dicey. The main idea is to make it \nsafe. Do something to make others comfortable. And remember, \nvirtually every skill we've covered in this book, from Contrasting \nto CRIB, offers a tool for building safety. \nThese two levers form the basis for recognizing, building, and \nmaintaining dialogue. When the concept of dialogue is intro­\nduced, these are the ideas most people can readily take in and \napply to crucial conversations. Now let's move on to a discussion \nuf the rest of the principles we've covered.\n\f\n1 82 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nA MODEL OF DIALOGUE \nTo help organize our thinking and to make it easier to recall the \nprinciples (and when to apply the m), let's look at the model \nshown in Figure 10-1. It begins with concentric circles-like a \ntarget. Notice that the center circle is the Pool of Shared \nMeaning -it's the center of the target, or the aim of dialogue. \nWhen meaning flows freely, it finds its way into this pool, which \nrepresents people's best collective thinking. \nSurrounding the Pool of Shared Meaning is safety. Safety \nallows us to share meaning and keeps us from moving into \nsilence or violence. When conversations become crucial, safety \nmust be strong. \nWatch for games. Next you'll notice that we've portrayed the \nbehaviors to watch when thinking about safety. These are the six \nsilence and violence behaviors we look for in others and in out-\nFigur e 10 -1. The Dialogue Model\n\f\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 18 3 \nFigur e 10 -2. The Dialogue Model \nbreaks of our own Style Under Stress. When we see these or sim­\nilar behaviors, we know that safety is weak. This is a cue to step \nout of the content of the conversation, strengthen safety, and \nthen step back in. Remember, don't back away or weaken the \nargument. Just rebuild safety. Do it quickly. The further you \nmove from dialogue into silence or violence, the harder it is to \nget back and the greater the costs. \nNow, let's add people to our model. \nMe and Others. (Figure 10-2). You are the \"ME\" arrow on the \nmodel. Others are included in the \"OTHER\" arrow. The arrows \n(both pointed to the center of the pool) show that both we and \nothers are in dialogue. All our meaning is flowing freely into the \nshared pool. Learn to Look means we watch for when either of \nthese two arrows begins to point upward or downward, toward \nsilence or violence. When this happens, either you or others are \nstarting to play games. \nWatching and building conditions. (Figure 10-3). When you \nsec yourself driftin g to si kncc or violence, Start with Heart. Keep\n\f\n18 4 CRUCIAL CONVERSA TIONS \nFigur e 10-3. The Dialogue Model \nyourself in dialogue by focusing on what you really want and then \nbehaving as if you really do want it. A void the Sucker's Choices \nthat make it appear as if silence and violence are the only options. \nWhen your emotions start running strong and taking control of \nthe conversation, use the Master My Stories principle to bring \nyour arrow back to the Pool of Shared Meaning. Retrace your Path \nto Action, watch for clever stories, and tell the rest of the story. \nWhen others move to silence or violence, Make It Safe. As we \nstrengthen safety, others are more likely to lay aside their silence \nand violence and move back toward dialogue in the center. \nWhat to do. The next three principles teach us what to do with \nour meaning. First, we learned to STATE My Path. We share our \nown sensitive or controversial views by following our Path to \nAction . We share the facts first and then tentatively share our \nstory. We then demonstrate we're serious about dialogue by \nencouraging others to share their story (Figure 10-4 )-especially \nif it's different from our own."

It outlines a tough discussion between you \nand your sister about dividing your mother's estate. The case is \nset up to illustrate where the principles apply, and to briefly \nreview each principle as it comes up in the conversation. \nThe conversation begins with you bringing up the family sum­\nmerhouse. Your mother's funeral was a month ago, and now it's \ntime to split up both money and keepsakes. You're not really \nlooking forward to it. \nThe issue is made touchier by the fact that you feel that since \nyou almost single-handedly cared for your mother during the \nlast several years, you should be compensated. You don't think \nyour sister will see things the same way. \nYour Cru cial Co nversati on \nYOU: We have to sell the summer cottage. We never use it, \nand we need the cash to pay for my expenses from taking \ncare of Mom the past four years.\n\f\npum N G IT ALL TOG ETH ER 1 89 \nSISTER: Please don't start with the guilt. I sent you money \nevery month to help take care of Mom. If I didn't have \nto travel for my jobs, you know I would have wanted her \nat my house. \nYou notice that emotions are already getting strong. You're \ngetting defensive, and your sister seems to be angry. You're in a \ncrucial conversation, and it's not going well. \nStart with Heart \nAsk yourself what you really want. You want to be compensated \nfairly for the extra time and money you put in that your sister \ndidn't. You also want to keep a good relationship with your sister. \nBut you want to avoid making a Sucker's Choice. So you ask \nyourself: \"Ho w can I tell her that I want to be compensated \nfairly for the extra effort and expense I put in and keep a good \nrelationship?\" \nLearn to Look \nYou recognize a lack of Mutual Purpose-you're both trying to \ndefend your actions rather than discuss the estate. \nMake It Safe \nContrast to help your sister understand your purpose. \nYOU: I don't want to start an argument or try to make you \nfeel guilty. But I do want to talk about being compensated \nfor shouldering most of the responsibility over the last few \nyears. I love Mom, but it put quite a strain on me finan­\ncially and emotionally. \nSISTER: What makes you think you did so much more than I \ndid?\n\f\n19 0 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nMaster My Stories \nYou're telling yourself that you deserve more because you did \nmore to care for your mother and covered unplanned expenses. \nRetrace your Path to Action to find out what facts are behind the \nstory you're telling that's making you angry. \nSTATE My Path \nYou need to share your facts and conclusions with your sister in \na way that will make her feel safe telling her story. \nYOU: It's just that I spent a lot of money taking care of Mom \nand did a lot of work caring for her instead of bringing in \na nurse. I know you cared about Mom too, but I honestly \nfeel like I did more in the day-to-day caregiving than you \ndid, and it only seems fair to use some of what she left us \nto repay a part of what I spent. Do you see it differently? \nI'd really like to hear. \nSISTER: Okay, fine. Why don't you just send me a bill. \nIt sounds as though your sister isn't really okay with this \narrangement. You can tell her voice is tense and her tone is one \nof giving in, not of true agreement. \nExplore Others' Paths \nSince part of your objective is to maintain a good relationship \nwith your sister, it's important that she add her meaning to the \npool. Use the AMPP skills to actively explore her views. \nYOU: The way you say that makes it sound like maybe that \nsuggestion isn't okay with you. [Mirror] Is there some­\nthing I'm missing? [Ask] \nSISTER: No-if you feel like you deserve more than I do, \nyou're probably right.\n\f\nPUTTI NG IT ALL TOGETH ER 1 91 \nYou: Do you think I'm being unfair? That I'm not acknowl­\nedging your contributions? [Prime] \nSISTER: It's just that I know I wasn't around much in the last \ncouple of years. I've had to travel a lot for work. But I still \nvisited whenever I could, and I sent money every month \nto help contribute to Mom's care. I offered to help pay to \nbring in a nurse if you thought it was necessary. I didn't \nknow you felt you had an unfair share of the responsibil­\nity, and it seems like your asking for more money is com­\ning out of nowhere. \nYou: So you feel like you were doing everything you could \nto help out and are surprised that I feel like I should be \ncompensated? [Paraphrase] \nSISTER: Well, yes. \nExplore Others' Paths \nYou understand your siste r's story now and still disagree to a \npoint. Use the ABC skills to explain how your view differs. You \nagree in part with how your sister sees things. Use building to \nemphasize what you agree with and to bring up what you dif­\nfer on. \nYou: You're right. You did a lot to help out, and I realize \nthat it was expensive to visit as often as you did. I opted \nnot to pay for professional home health care because \nMom was more comfortable with me taking care of her, \nand I didn't mind that. On top of that, there were some \nincidental expenses it doesn't sound like you were aware \nof. The new medication she was on during the last eight­\neen months was twice as expensive as the old, and the \ninsurance only covered a percentage of her hospital stays. \nIt adds up.\n\f\n19 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nSISTER: So it's these expenses you're worried about cover­\ning? Could we go over these expenses to decide how to \ncover them? \nMove to Action \nYou want to create a definite plan for being reimbursed for these \nexpenses, and you want it to be one you both agree on. Come to \na consensus about what will happen, and document who does \nwhat by when, and settle on a way to follow up. \nYou : I've kept a record of all the expenses that went over \nthe amount that both of us agreed to contribute. Can we \nsit down tomorrow to go over those and talk about what's \nfair to reimburse me for? \nSISTER: Okay. We'll talk about the estate and write up a plan \nfor how to divide things up. \nSUM MARY- PUTTING IT All TOGETHER \nIf we first learn to recognize when safety is at risk and a conver­\nsation becomes crucial (Learn to Look) and that we need to take \nsteps to Make It Safe for everyone to contribute his or her mean­\ning, we can begin to see where to apply the skills we've learned. \nA visual model can also help us see where the principles and \nskills are needed. \nUsing these tools and reminders will get us started in master­\ning the skills that help us improve our crucial conversations."

Besides, most of the problems I face come \nas a surprise. I'm caught off guard.\" In short, people can think \nof a dozen reasons why the skills we've been talking about don't \napply to the situations they care about. \n• \"Yeah, but what if someone does something that's really sub­\ntle?

The person does it seldom enough and he or she's subtle \nenough that you're not sure if HR or your boss can even help. \nWhat can you do? \nIn these situations it's easy to think that the offender has all \nthe power. It seems as if the rules of polite society make it so that \nothers can behave inappropriately and you end up looking like \nyou're overreacting if you bring it up. \nGenerally speaking, a vast maj ority of these problems go away \nif they're privately, respectfully, and firmly discussed.

We get together and \ntalk about all the ways we could improve, but then \npeople don't do what they agreed to. \" \nThe Danger Point \nThe worst teams walk away from problems like these. In good \nteams, the boss eventually deals with problem behavior. In the \nbest teams, every team member is part of the system of account­\nability. If team members see others violate a team agreement, \nthey speak up immediately and directly. It's dangerous to wait for \nor expect the boss to do what good teammates should do them­\nselves. \nThe So lution \nIf your teammate isn't doing what you think he or she should, it's \nup to you to speak up. \nWe realized this after watching a group of executives that \nagreed they'd hold off on all discretionary spending to help free \nup cash for a short-term crunch. This strategy sounded good in \nthe warm glow of an off-site meeting, but the very next day a \nteam member rushed back and prepaid a vendor for six months \nof consulting work-work that appeared to be \"disc retionary.\" \nA team member who saw the executive prepare for and then \nmake the prepayment didn't realize this was the crucial conver­\nsation that would determine whether the team would pull \ntogether or fall apart on this issue. Instead, he decided it was up \nto the boss to hold this person accountable. He said nothing. By \nthe time the boss found out about the transaction and addressed \nthe issue. the policy had already been violated and the money\n\f\n19 8 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nspent. Motivation to support the new plan dissipated, and the \nteam ran short of cash. \nWhen teams try to rally around aggressive change or bold new \ninitiatives, they need to be prepared to address the problem \nwhen a team member doesn't live up to the agreement. Success \ndoes not depend on perfect compliance with new expectations, \nbut on teammates who hold crucial conversations with one \nanother when others appear to be reverting to old patterns. \nDEFERENC E TO AUTH ORITY \nPEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME FILTER WHAT they say by \ngue ssing what they think I'm willing to hear. They take \n\"YEAH, \nBU T ... little initiative in solving import ant problems because \nthey' re afraid 1'1/ disagree with them. \" \nThe Danger Point \nWhen leaders face deference-or what feels like kissi ng up­\nthey typically make one of two mistak es. Either they misdiagnose \nthe cause (fear), or they try to banish deference with a brash \ncommand. \nMisdiagn ose. Often, leaders are causing the fear but denying \nit. \"Who me? I don't do a thing to make people feel uncomfort­\nable.\" They haven't Learned to Look. Th ey're unaware of their \nStyle Under Stress. Despite this disclaimer, the way they carry \nthemselves, their habit of speaking in absolutes, their subtle use \nof authority-something out there-is creating fear and eventual \ndeference. \nThen there's the other misdiagn osis: leaders who face \"head­\nbobbing kiss-ups\" often think they're doing something wrong \nwhen, in fact, they're living with ghosts of previous leaders. They \ndo their best to be open and supportive and to involve people,\n\f\nYEAH, BUT 19 9 \nbut despite their genuine efforts, people still keep their distance. \nOften, people treat their leaders like celebrities or dictators, \nregardless of the fact that they've done nothing to deserve it. \nBefore you do anything, you need to find out if you're the \ncause, if you're living with ghosts of bosses past, or both. \nCommand it away. Many leaders seek the simple path. They \ntell people to stop deferring. \n\"It seems to me that you're agreeing with me because I'm \nthe boss and not because what I'm saying makes sense.\" \n\"Absolutely!\" \n\"I'd prefer that you stop deferring to me and simply listen \nto the idea.\" \n\"Okay. whatever you say, Boss !\" \nWith ingrained deference you face a catch-22. If you don't say \nsomething, it'll probably continue. If you do say something, you \nmay be inadvertently encouraging it to continue. \nThe Solut ion \nWork on me first. Discover your part in the problem. Don't ask \nyour direct reports. If they're already deferring to you, they'll \nwhitewash the problem. Consult with a peer who watches you in \naction. Ask for honest feedback. Are you doing things that cause \npeople to defer to you? If so, what? Explore your peer's path by \nhaving him or her point out your specific behaviors. Jointly devel­\nop a plan of attack, work on it, and seek continued feedback. \nIf the problem stems from ghosts (the actions of previous \nleaders), go public. Describe the problem in a group or team \nmeeting and then ask for advice. Don't try to command it away. \nYou can't. Reward risk takers. Encourage testing. When people \ndo express an opinion contrary to yours, thank them for their \nhonesty. Play de vil' s advocate. If you can't get others to disagree,\n\f\n200 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthen disagree with yourself. Let people know that all ideas are \nopen to question. If you need to, leave the room. Give people \nsome breathing space. \nFAILED TRUST \nn YEA H, \nBUT. .. \nI DON'T KNOW WHAT to do. I'm not sure I can trust this \nperson. He missed an import ant deadline. Now I wonder \nif I sho uld trus t him again. \" \nThe Danger Point \nPeople often assume that trust is something you have or don't \nhave. Either you trust someone or you don't. That puts too much \npressure on trust. \"What do you mean I can't stay out past mid­\nnight? Don't you trust me?\" your teenage son inquires. \nTr ust doesn't have to be universally offered. In truth, it's usu­\nally offered in degrees and is very topic specific. It also comes in \ntwo flavors-motive and ability. For example, you can trust me \nto administer CPR if needed; I'm motivated. But you can't trust \nme to do a good job; I know nothing about it. \nThe Solution \nDeal with trust around the issue, not around the person. \nWhen it comes to regaining trust in others, don't set the bar \ntoo high. Just try to trust them in the moment, not across all \nissues. You don't have to trust them in everything. To make it \nsafe for yourself in the moment, bring up your concerns. \nTe ntatively STATE what you see happening. \"I get the sense that \nyou're only sharing the good side of your plan. I need to hear the \npossible risks before I'm comfortable. Is that okay?\" If they play \ngames, call them on it."

    "raw_text": "204 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe Dang er Point \nMost people are far more likely to talk about the presence of a \nbad behavior than the absence of a good one. When someone \nreally messes up, leaders and parents alike are compelled to take \naction. However, when people simply fail to be excellent, it's \nhard to know what to say. \nThe Solution \nEstablish new and higher expectations. Don't deal with a specific \ninstance; deal with the overall pattern. If you want someone to \nshow more initiative, tell him or her. Give specific examples of \nwhen the person ran into a barrier and then backed off after a \nsingle try. Raise the bar and then make it crystal clear what \nyou've done. Jointly brainstorm what the person could have done \nto be both more persistent and more creative in coming up with \na solution. \nFor instance, \"I asked you to finish up a task that absolutely \nhad to be completed before I returned from a trip. You ran into \na problem, tried to get in touch with me, and then simply left a \nmessage with my four-year-old. What could you have done to \ntrack me down on the road?\" or \"What would it have taken to \ncreate a backup strategy?\" \nPay attention to ways you are compensating for someone's \nlack of initiative. Have you made yourself responsible for fol­\nlowing up? If so, talk with that person about assuming this \nresponsibility. Have you asked more than one person to take the \nsame assignment so you can be sure it will get done? If so, talk \nto the person originally assigned about reporting progress to you \nearly so you only need to put someone else on the job when \nthere's a clear need for more resources. \nStop acting out your expectations that others won't take initia­\ntive. Instead, talk your expectations out and come to agreements"

It's that I keep having to \ntalk with people about the same problem. I feel like I \nu YEA H, \nBUT... have to choose between bei ng a nag and putt ing up \nwith the problem. Now what?\" \nThe Danger Point \nSome crucial conversations go poorly because you're having the \nwrong conversations. You talk to someone who is late for a \nmeeting for the second time, Then the third. Your blood begins \nto boil. Then you bite your lip and give another gentle reminder. \nFinally, after your resentment builds up (because you're telling \nyourself an ugly story), you become violent. You make a sarcas­\ntic or cutting comment and then end up looking stupid because \nthe reaction seems way out of line given the minor offense. \nIf you continue to return to the original problem (coming in \nlate) without talking about the new problem (failing to live up to \ncommitme nts), you're stuck in \"Groundhog Day.\" We talk about \nthis problem using the Groundhog Day movie metaphor. If you \nreturn to the same initial problem, you're like Bill Murray in the \nmovie-you're forced to relive the same situation over and over \nrather than deal with the bigger problem. Nothing ever gets \nresolved. \nThe Solution \nLearn to Loo k for patterns. Don't focus exclusively on a single \nevent. Watch fol' behavior over time. Then STATE Your Path by \ntalkin g about th (: pu1 t(:rn, Por example, if a person is late for\n\f\n206 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nmeetings and agrees to do better, the next conversation should \nnot be about tardiness. It should be about his or her failure to \nkeep a commitme nt. This is a bigger issue. It's now about trust \nand respect. \nPeople often become far more emotional than the issue they're \ndiscussing warrants because they're talking about the wrong \nissue. If you're really bothered because of a pattern, but you're \ntalking about this latest instance, your emotions will seem out of \nproportion. In contrast, an interesting thing happens when you \nhold the right conversation. Your emotions calm down. When \nyou talk about what's really eating you-the pattern-you'll be \nable to be more composed and effective. \nDon't get pulled into any one instance or your concern will \nseem trivial. Talk about the overall pattern. \nI NEED TIME TO CALM DOWN ! \n\"YEAH, \nBUT ... \nIVE BEEN TOLD THAT I sho uld never go to bed angry. Is \nthat always a good idea?\" \nThe Danger Point \nOnce you've become angry, it's not always easy to calm down. \nYou've told yourself an ugly story, your body has responded by \npreparing for a fight, and now you're trying your best not to \nduke it out-only your body hasn't caught up with your brain. \nSo what do you do? Do you try to stay in dialogue even though \nyour intuition tells you to back off and buy some time? After all, \nMom said, \"Never go to bed angry.\" \nThe Solution \nOkay, so your mom wasn't exactly right. She was right by sug­\ngesting that you shouldn't let serious problems go unresolved.\n\f\nYEAH, BUT 207 \nShe was wrong about always sticking with a discussion, no mat­\nter your emotional state. It's perfectly okay to suggest that you \nneed some time alone and that you'd like to pick up the discus­\nsion later on-say, tomo rrow. Then, after you've dissipated the \nadrenaline and have had time to think about the issues, hold the \nconversation. Coming to mutual agreement to take a time-out is \nnot the same thing as going to silence. In fact, it's a very healthy \nexample of dialogue. \nAs a sidenote on this topic, it's not such a good idea to tell oth­\ners that they need to calm down or that they need to take some \ntime out. They may need the time, but it's hard to suggest it with­\nout coming off as patronizing. \"Take ten minutes, calm down, \nand then get back to me.\" With others, get back to the source of \ntheir anger. Retrace their Path to Action. \nEND LESS EXCUSES \n\"YEAH, \nBUT ... \nMY TEENAGE SON is a master of exc uses. I talk to him \nabout a problem, and he' s always got a new re ason \nwhy it's not his fault. \" \nThe Danger Point \nIt's easy to be lulled into a series of never-ending excuses-par­\nticularly if the other person doesn't want to do what you've \nasked and learns that as long as he or she can give you a plausi­\nble reason, all bets are off. \n\"I go to work before my son leaves for school, and he's con­\nstantly late. First he told me that he was late because his \nalarm broke. The next day the old car we bought him had \na problem-or so he says. Then his friend forgot to pick \nhim up. Then he had a hl!ad cold and couldn't hear his new \na I\" 1'1ll . Thl!11 . . . \"\n\f\n208 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe Solution \nWith \"imaginative\" people, take a preemptive strike against all new \nexcuses. Gain a commitment to solve the overall problem, not sim­\nply the stated cause. For instance, the first time the person is late, \nseek a commitment to fix the alarm-and anything else that might \nstand in the way. Repairing the alarm only deals with one potential \ncause. Ask the person to deal with the problem-being late. \n\"So you think that if you get a new alarm, you'll be able to \nmake it to school on time? That's fine with me. Do what­\never it takes to get there on time. Can I count on you being \nthere tomorrow at eight o'clock sharp?\" \nThen remember, as the excuses accumulate, don't talk about the \nmost recent excuse; talk about the pattern. \nINSUBORDI NATION (OR OVER-TH E-LINE DlSRESPEcn \nIIYEAH, \nBUT ... \nWHAT IF THE PEOPLE you talk to not only are angry. but \nalso become insubor dinate? How do you handle that?\" \nThe Danger Point \nWhen you're discus sing a tough issue with employees (or even \nyour kids ), there's always the chance they'll step over the line. \nThey 'll move from a friendly dispute to a heated discussion and \nthen into the nasty territory of being insubordinate or acting dis­\nrespectful. \nThe trouble is, insubordination is so rare that it takes most \nleaders by surprise. So they buy time to figure out what to do. \nAnd in so doing, they let the person get away with something \nthat was way out of line. Worse still, their perceived indifference \nmakes them an accomplice to all future abuses. Parents, on the\n\f\nYEAH, BUT 209 \nother hand, caught by surprise, tend to respond in kind, becom­\ning angry and insulting. \nThe Solution \nShow zero tolerance for insubordination. Speak up immediat ely, \nbut respectfully. Change topics from the issue at hand to how the \nperson is currently acting. Catch the escalating disrespect before \nit turns into abuse and insubordination . Let the person know \nthat his or her passion for the issue at hand is leading down a \ndangerous trail. \"I'd like to step away from this scheduling issue \nfor a moment-then we'll come right back to it. The way you're \nleaning in toward me and raising your voice seems disrespec tful. \nI want to help address your concerns, but I'm going to have a \ntough time doing so if this continues.\" \nIf you can't catch it early, discuss the insubordination and seek \nhelp from HR specialists. \nREGRETTING SAYING SOM ETHING HORRIBL E \nnYEAH, \nBUT ... \nSOMETIMES I LET A PROBLEM go fo r a long time, and \nthen when I bring it up, I say some thing just awful. \nHow do I re cover from this?\" \nThe Danger Point \nWhen other people do things that bother us, and then we tell \nourselves a story about how they're bad and wrong, we're setting \nourselves up for an unhealthy conversation. Of course, when we \ntell ourselves an ugly story and then sit on it, it only gets worse. \nStories left unattended don't get better with time-they ferment. \nThen, when we eventually can't take it anymore, we say some­\nthing we regret."

    "raw_text": "210 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe Solution \nFirst, don't repress your story. Use your ST AT E skills early on, \nbefore the story turns too ugly. Second, if you have let the prob­\nlem build, don't hold the crucial conversation while angry. Set \naside a time when you can discuss it in a calm fashion. Then, \nusing your ST AT E skills, explain what you've seen and heard, \nand tentatively tell the most simple and least offensive story. \n\"The way you just told me that our neighbor thinks I'm a real \nidiot has me worried. You smiled and laughed when you said it. \nI'm beginning to wonder if you take pleasure in running to me \nwith negative feedback. Is that what's going on?\" \nIf you do say something horrible-\"You're cruel, you know \nthat? You love to hurt me and I'm sick of it\" -apologize. You \ncan't uming the bell, but you can apologize. Then STATE Your \nPath. \nTOUCHY AND PERSONAL \nIlYEAH, \nBUT... \nWHAT IF SOMEONE has a hygiene problem? Or maybe \nsomeo ne' s bor ing and people avoid him or her. How \ncould you ever talk about somet hing personal and \nsensitive like that?\" \nThe Danger Point \nMost people avoid sensitive issues like the plague. Who can blame \nthem? Unfortunately, when fear and misapplied compassion rule \nover honesty and courage, people can go for years without being \ngiven information that could be extremely helpful. \nWhen people do speak up, they often leap from silence to vio­\nlence. Jokes, nicknames, and other veiled attempts to sneak in \nvague feedback are both indirect and disrespectful. Also, the\n\f\nYEAH, BUT 211 \nlonger you go without saying anything, the greater the pain when \nyou finally deliver the message. \nThe So lution \nUse Contrasting. Explain that you don't want to hurt the person's \nfeelings, but you do want to share something that could be help­\nful. Establish Mutual Purpose. Let the other person know your \nintentions are honorable. Also explain that you're reluctant to \nbring up the issue because of its personal nature, but since the \nproblem is interfering with the person's effectiveness, you really \nmust. Te ntatively describe the problem. Don't play it up or pile \nit on. Describe the specific behaviors and then move to solu­\ntions. Although these discussions are never easy, they certainly \ndon't have to be offensive or insulting. \nWORD GAMES \n'IYEAH, \nBUT. .. \nMY CHILDREN are constantly playing word games . If I \ntry to tell them that they shouldn't have done some­\nthing, they say I never told them exa ctly that. They' re \nstarting to get on my ner ves. \" \nThe Danger Point \nSometimes parents (and leaders) are tricked into accepting poor \nperformance by silver-tongued individuals who are infinitely \ncreative in coming up with new ways to explain why they didn't \nknow any better. Not only do these inventive people have the \nability to conjure up creative excuses, but they also have the \nenergy and will to do so incessantly. Eventually they wear you \ndown. As a result, they get away with doing less or doing it\n\f\n21 2 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \npoorly, while hard-working, energetic family members (or employ­\nees) end up carrying an unfair share of the load. \nThe Solution \nThis is another case of pattern over instance. Te ntatively ST AT E \nthe pattern of splitting hairs and playing word games. Let them \nknow they aren't fooling anyone. In this case, don't focus exclu­\nsively on actions, because creative people can always find new \ninappropriate actions. \"You didn't say I couldn't call her 'stu­\npid.''' Talk about both behaviors and outcome s. \"You're hurting \nyour sister's feelings when you call her stupid. Please don't do \nthat, or anything else that might hurt her feelings.\" \nUse previous behavior as an example, and then hold them \naccountable to resu lts. Don't get pulled into discussing any one \ninstance. Stick with the pattern. \nNO WARNING \nu YEA H, \nBUT... \nI' VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD people working fo r me, but \nthey' re too full of sur prises. When they run into prob­\nlems, I only find out after it's too late. They always \nhave a good excuse, so what should I do?\" \nThe Danger Point \nLeaders who are constantly being surprised allow it to happen. \nThe first time an employee says, \"Sorry, but I ran into a prob­\nlem,\" the leaders miss the point. They listen to the problem, \nwork on it, and then move on to a new topic. In so doing, they \nare saying: \"It's okay to surprise me. If you have a legitimate \nexcuse, stop what you're doing, tum your efforts to something \nelse, and then wait until I show up to spring the news.\"\n\f\nYEAH. BUT 21 3 \nThe So lution \nMake it perfectly clear that once you've given an assignment, \nthere are only two acceptable paths. Employees need to complete \nthe assignment as planned, or if they run into a problem, they \nneed to immediately inform you. No surprises. Similarly, if they \ndecide that another job needs to be done instead, they call you. \nNo surprises. \nClarif y the \"no surprises\" rule. The first time someone comes \nback with a legitimate excuse-but he or she didn't tell you \nwhen the problem first came up-deal with this as the new prob­\nlem. \"We agreed that you'd let me know immediat ely. I didn't get \na call. What happened?\" \nDEALI NG WITH SOMEONE WHO BREAKS ALL THE RULES \n\"YEAH/ \nBUT. .. \nWHAT IF THE PERSON you 're dealing with viola tes all of \nthe dialogue principles most of the time-especially \nduring crucia l con versa tions. \" \nThe Danger Point \nWhen you look at a continuum of dialogue skills, most of us (by \ndefinition) fall in the middle. Sometime s we're on and some­\ntimes we're off. Some of us are good at avoiding Sucker's \nChoices; others are good at making it safe. Of course, you have \nthe extremes as well. You have people who are veritable conver­\nsational geniuses. And now you're saying that you work with \n(maybe live with) someone who is the complete opposite. He or \nshe rarely uses any skills. What's a person to do? \nThe danger, of course, is that the other person isn't as bad as \nyou think-you bring out the worst in him or her-or that he or \nshe really is that bad . and you try to address all the problems at \nonce.\n\f\n214 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nThe Solution \nLet's assume this person is pretty bad all of the time and with \nmost everyone. Where do you start? Let's apply a metaphor here. \nHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Choose your \ntargets very carefully. Consider two dimensions: (1) What both­\ners you the most? \"He or she is constantly assuming the worst \nand telling horrible stories.\" (2) What might be the easiest to \nwork on? \"He or she rarely shows any appreciation.\" \nLook for those areas that are most grievous to you and might \nnot be all that hard to talk about. Pick one element and work on \nit. Establish Mutual Purpose. Frame the conversation in a way \nthat the other person will care about. \n\"I love it when we're feeling friendly toward each other. I'd \nlike to have that feeling more frequently between us. There \nare a couple of things I'd like to talk about that I'm pretty \nconvinced would help us with that. Can we talk?\" \nSTATE the issue, and then work on that one issue. Don't nag; \ndon't take on everything at once. Deal with one element, one day \nat a time.\n\f\n12 \nTo improve is to changei \nto be petfoct is to change often. \n-WINSTON CHURCHILL \nChange Your Life \nHow to Turn Ideas into Habits \nOne day you \"overhear\" yourself enthusias tically talking about a \nprofessional wrestling match. You're speaking with such gusto \nthat you give yourself the willies. You think to yourself: \"You \nknow what? It's time to expand my cultural horizons.\" So you \nvow to read more widely and to watch three programs on the sci­\nence channel for every episode of reality TV. \nWhile you're at it, you commit to trimming down a bit as well. \nA reasonable diet and moderate exercise program couldn't hurt. \nTo top it all off, you note that you're nearly consumed with your \nwork, so you swear to spend more time with your family. \nMore culture, better health, a stronger family-certainly you'll \nquickly transform such worthy desires into daily habits. \nHardly. Changes of this sort are rarely easy. When it comes to \nturning out· wisp y hopl!s into concrete realities, our success rate"

Actually, it depends. There are a lot of vari­\nables that affect our chances. Consider the following factors. \nSURPRISE \nYou've been asked to conduct your first meeting. To avoid \nembarrassing yourself, you read a book where you learn all about \nagendas, pacing, and the like. When it's time to lead your first \nmeeting, you arrive early, adjust the chairs, set the markers just \nso, and lay out an agenda for each participant. As participants \narrive, you greet them cordially. Then you kick off the meeting \nwith a rousing icebreaker and you're off and running. \nImplementing meeting skills is as easy as falling off a log. \nThat's because meetings are evident. You know when you're in \none. You're seated at a table along with a bunch of other people. \nHow could you not know you're in a meeting? They're also pre­\ndictable. You can plan for them. You even have time to go over \nunderlined portions from the book. \nCrucial conversations, in contrast, are far less evident. You \ndon't sit in a crucial conversations room. You don't pass around \na picture of your Path to Action. Instead you get thrown into a \nheated discussion where you rarely think, \"Oh yes, I'm in the \nmiddle of a crucial conversation. That means I need to think \nabout all that stuff I read last week.\" \nDiscussi ons are also less predictable. Nobody sends you an \ninvitation stating: \"Would you please engage me in a crucial con­\nversation next week after the team meeting where you're going \nto make a policy that will miff me?\" High-risk discussions don't \ncome with notices and reminders. More often than not, they \ncome as unwelcome surprises."

Your \nability to pull yourself out of the content of a discussion and to \nfocus on the process is inversely proportional to your level of \nemotion. The more you care about what's happening, the less \nlikely you are to think about how you're conducting yourself. \nIt's almost unfair. The bigger the deal, the less likely you are \nto bring your newly acquired skill-set into the conversation. Like \nit or not, if your adrenaline is flowing, you're almost guaranteed \nto jump to your Style Under Stress. \nBetween surprise and emotion, it's hard to know which is the \nbigger enemy of change. Both make it hard to remember to act \nin new ways. \nSCRIPTS \nNow let's look at still another enemy of change-scripts. Scripts \nare pre bundled phrases we use in common conversations; they \nform the very foundation of social habits and often make change \nalmost impossible. Consider the following. \nWhen we learn to speak, first come words, then phrases, and \nthen scripts. The larger the bundles of words we carry around, the \nless we have to worry about combining them into sensible expres­\nsions. Also the less we have to fret over syntax or grammar -that \nwork has already been done for us. \nUnfortunately, predetermined expressions also put us into a \nsort of mental autopilot. Consider what happens when you walk \ninto a fast-food restaurant. Do you think about the words you'll \nchoose? Probably not. That's because when you enter familiar \ncircumstances, you're carrying not only words and phrases, but \nan en tire scrip t in your head.\n\f\n218 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nWith a script, you know both sides of the conversation. You \nknow that the person at the counter is going to ask for your \norder. You're certain that the perky young woman with the paper \nhat is going to ask you if you want fries. Even if you include fries \nin your original request, she's still going to ask, \"Do you want \nfries with that?\" And if you say yes, you can bet the farm that \nshe's going to ask, \"Do you want to super-size that?\" \nThe good news about packing around scripts is that you don't \nhave to give conversation much thought. The bad news is that \nthe more scripted an interaction, the more difficult it is to pull \nyourself out of the routine and try something new. For example, \nas you walk up to a fast-food counter, your spouse reminds you \nto ask for extra ketchup. \nYou step up to the counter and say: \"I'll have two house spe­\ncials, three kiddy delights ... \" and then you slip into autopilot. \nThe words that pour out of your mouth have no relation to your \nthoughts. Your brain is somewhere else entirely. You're musing \nover a menu that sports a sandwich made out of \"ribs\" that have \nno bones. \"What poor animal has boneless ribs ?\" you're think­\ning to yourself. \nAnd gue ss what? As you robotically state your order, one \nword spilling out after another, you forget to ask for extra \nketchup. What do you expect from a person who's devoting no \nreal brain time to the interaction? In fact, your spouse's request \nnever even makes it onto your radar screen-which is currently \nfilled with images of Jell-O-like, ribless creatures mooing and \nslithering across a backdrop painted by Salvador Dali. \nScripts place us on a smooth and familiar track. They take us \nacross known territory and at a comfortable pace-freeing our \nbrains for more novel work. But then again, when we're on rails, \nwe travel along the prescribed route with such finesse and ease \nthat it's almost impossible to make an unscheduled turn."

    "raw_text": "CHANGE YOUR LIFE 219 \nWHAT ARE OUR CHANCES? \nSo let's see what we're facing when we try to change our Style \nUnder Stress. To ugh conversations come at us out of nowhere, \nfill us with adrenaline, and evoke comfortable (but not neces­\nsarily good) routines. They are spontaneous, emotional, and \nbacked by years of practice. \nConsequently, when you examine people working through \ncrucial conversations, they look a lot more like racehorses charg­\ning out of the gate than human beings making choices. Conver­\nsationalists are shocked into motion by surprise, whipped up to \nspeed by high stakes and strong emotions, and propelled along a \ncompletely predictable course by scripts that offer few if any \noptions. \nTRANSFER TIPS \nGiven the challenges of altering routine scripts, can people \nactually change? Early in our research, we (the authors) once \nexamined forty-eight front-line supervisors who were learning \nhow to hold crucial conversations . As we watched the trainees \nback at work, it became clear to us that only a few of them \ntransferred what they had learned in the classroom back to \ntheir work site. The bad news is that most of them didn't \nchange an iota. The good news is that some of them did. In \nfact, they used the new skills precisely as instructed. \nThe supervisors who found a way to apply the new skills \ntaught us the following four principles for turning ideas into \naction: \n• First, mast er the content. That means not only do you have \nto be able to recognize what works and why, but you have to \ngenerate new scripts of your own.\n\f\n220 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n• Second, master the skills. You must be able to enact these new \nscripts in a way that is consistent with the supporting princi­\nples. As it turns out, simply understanding a concept isn't \nenough. While it's helpful, even necessary to talk the talk, you \nhave to be able to walk the talk. You have to be able to say the \nright words with the right tone and nonverbal actions. When \nit comes to social skills, knowing and doing are two different \nanimals. \n• Third, enhance your motive. You must want to change. This \nmeans that you have to care enough about improving your \ncrucial conversation skills to actually do something. You have \nto move from a passive sense that it would be a good idea to \nchange, to an active desire to seek opportunities . Ability with­\nout motive lies dormant and untapped. \n• Fourth, watch for cues. To overcome surprise, emotion, and \nscripts, you must recognize the call to action. This is usually \npeople's biggest obstacle to change. Old stimuli generate old \nresponses. If a problem doesn't cue your new skills, you'll return \nto your old habits without even realizing you missed a chance to \ntry something new. \nMaster the Content \nThere's too much material in this book to try to master in one sit­\nting. Despite the fact that you may have read this book rather \nquickly, a rapid once-over rarely generates much of a change in \nbehavior. You may have a feel for the content, but probably not \nenough to propel you to change. \nHere are some other steps you can take to help master the \ncontent."

    "raw_text": "CHANGE YOUR LIFE 221 \nDo something. Years ago, Dale Carnegie recommended that \nyou read his now classic How to Win Friends and Influence \nPeople one chapter at a time. Then, once you finished the chap­\nter, he suggested you go out and practice what you learned from \nit. We agree. Pick a chapter you found relevant (possibly one \nwith a low score in your Style Under Stress test) and read it \nagain. This time, implement what you learned over a three-to \nfive-day period. Look for opportunities. Pounce on every chance \nyou get. Step up to the plate and give the skills a try. Then pick \nanother chapter and repeat the process. \nDiscuss the mat erial. When you first learn something, your \nknowledge is \"preverbal.\" That is, you might recognize the con­\ncepts if you see them, but you're not able to discuss them with \nease. You haven't talked about them enough to make them part \nof your functional vocabulary. You haven't turned the words \ninto phrases and the phrases into scripts. To move your knowl­\nedge to the next level, read a chapter and then discuss it with a \nfriend or loved one. Ta lk about the material until the concepts \ncome naturally. \nTeach the mat erial. If you really want to master a concept, \nteach it to someone else. Stick with it until the other person \nunderstands the concept well enough to pass it on to someone \nelse. \nMaster the Skills \nThere 's a story going around the self-help talk circuit about a \nVi etnam War prisoner who played golf in his head in order to \nhelp maintain his sanity. He'd mentally step up to each hole at \nhis favorite golf course and \"play\" an entire round. After being \nreleased, he eventually found his way to the course, where he \npromptly shot his best score ever, one under par. When his \nfrien ds acted asto nishe d at his new-found talent, he explained,"

    "raw_text": "222 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \n\"Why shouldn't I have shot under par? I never once shot over \npar while I was in prison.\" \nThis tale is routinely used to teach the power of mental prepa­\nration. Gurus can't say enough about the power of the mental \ngame . While we agree that thinking is an essential part of the \nprocess, we'd like to emphasize the greater importance of doing. \nEvidence suggests that mental preparation can make some dif­\nference in execution, but thinking isn't enough. If you really want \nto improve your ability, practice. Step up to problems and give \nthe material a try. \nRehearse with a friend. Start by rehearsing with a friend. Ask \na colleague or coworker to partner with you. Explain that you'd \nlike to practice the skills you're learning. Briefly discuss the skill \nyou'll be attempting. Provide the details of a real problem you're \nfacing. (D on't include names or otherwise violate privacy \nissues.) Next, ask your friend to play the role of the other person \nand practice the crucial conversation. \nAsk your partner to give you honest feedback. Otherwise you \ncould be practicing the wrong delivery. Remember, practice \ndoesn't make perf ect; perfect practice makes perfect. Insist that \nyour practice partner hold you to a high standard. Make sure \nyou're constantly improving . \nPractice on the fly. You're going to be holding crucial conver­\nsations at home and at work, or you wouldn't have bought this \nbook in the first place. So practice the skills you've been read­\ning, teaching, and rehearsing. If you have children, hardly a day \nwill pass that you won't have a chance to practice. \nStart immediat ely. If you wait until you're perfect before you \ngive something a try, you could be waiting a long time. To make \nit safe, pick a conversation of only medium risk. Tr ying out \nsomething new is hard enough without applying it to a monu­\nmental problem.\n\f\nCHANGE YOUR LIFE 223 \nPractice in a training session. For those of you who would like \nmore material and practice opportunities than you can extract \nfrom a book and other static materials, attend one of our live \ntraining seminars. Give us a call and see if you can either sched­\nule a session at a location near you or bring the training into your \ncompany. \nOur training materials library is equipped with a variety of \ndelivery tools ranging from leader-guided workshops to off-site \nintensive courses. \nEnha nce Your Motive \nWe all have ideas about how to motivate others, but how do you \nmotivate yourself? While you may feel 100 percent comm itted to \nimproving your crucial conversations right now, what can you do \nwhen you're staring at an angry coworker and your commi tment \nto improVIDent drops to, say, 10 percent? \nThe truth is that we often need to take steps to ensure that our \nmost well-founded wishes (those made during peaceful moments \nwhere we're taking an honest look at the future) survive turbu­\nlent, less forward-looking circumstances. \nApply incen tives. Start with the obvious. Use incentives. For \nexample, people going through self-help courses are often \nencouraged to put their money where their mouth is. Every time \nthey fulfill an assignment, they're given back a portion of their \ntuition. On the other hand, if they don't step up, it costs them. \nWhen incentives are added, results improve fairly dramatically. \nSo every time you deftly hold a crucial conversation, celebrate \nyour victory. Tr eat yourself to something you wouldn't otherwise \nenjoy. And don't wait for perfection. Celebrate improvement. If \nyou used to get in a heated argument every time you brought up \na cel-tain problem. and now the interaction is merely tense, enjoy\n\f\n224 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nthe victory. Self-improvement is achieved by individuals who \nappreciate direction more than those who demand perfection. \nApply disincentives. You might consider disincentives as well. \nTa ke a look at what went on at Stanford a few years back. \nSubjects who were trying to lose weight were asked to write a \ndonation check to an organization they despised. These checks \nwere then set aside, never to be mailed unless the subjects failed \nto live up to their goals-at which point five hundred dollars \nwas sent to Americans for Nuclear Proliferation or something \nequally distas teful to the subject. As predicted, subjects did bet­\nter when they used disincentives.l \nGo pUbl ic. Let others know that you're trying to routinely \nhold crucial conversations. Explain what you're doing and why. \nOver half a century ago, Dr. Kurt Lewin, the father of social psy­\nchology, learned that when subjects made a public commitment \nto do something, they were more likely to stay the course than if \nthey kept their wishes to themselves.2 Te ll people what your \ngoals are. Get social pressure working in your favor. \nTalk with your boss. If you want to take it a step further, sit \ndown with your boss and explain your goals. Ask for his or her \nsupport. If you want to put some real teeth into your goal, build \nyour plan into your performance review. As a leader, you're almost \nalways asked to pick one \"soft area\" listed on your performance \nreview forms and work on it. Select dialogue. You might as well \ntie your plans for improvement into the formal reward system. \nAlign your personal, family, and organizational goals to a single \ngoal-improving your dialogue skills. \nRemember the costs; focus on the reward. Perhaps the most \npredictive piece of social science research ever conducted was \ncompleted with small children and marshmallows. A child was \nput in a room and then told that he or she could have either one \nmarshmallow now or two if he or she was willing to wait until \nthe adult returned in a few minutes. The adult would then place\n\f\nCHANGE YOUR LIFE 225 \none marshmallow in front of the child and exit. Some of the chil­\ndren delayed gratification. Others ate the marshmallow right \naway. Researchers continued studying these children. \nOver the next several decades, the children who had delayed \ngratification ended up doing far better in life than those who \nhadn't. They had stronger marriages, made more money, and \nwere healthier.3 This willingness to do without now in order to \nachieve more later turns out to be an all-purpose tool for success. \nHow did the children who were able to delay gratification \nfight off their short-term wishes? First, they looked away from \nthe scrumptious marshmallow that sat in front of them. No use \ntorturing themselves with the vision of what they couldn't have. \nSecond, they kept telling themselves that if they waited, they \nwould get two, not one. What could be simpler? \nAs you step up to a crucial conversation and wonder if it's \nreally worth trying out something new and untested, remind \nyourself why you're trying new skills in the first place. Focus on \nimproved results. Remember what happens when you fall back \non your old methods. \nThink \"thing s.\" How can things help motivate you? Actually, \nthis particular concept isn't easy to grasp. An example might \nhelp. You're unsuccessfully trying to lose weight. It turns out \nthat your early-morning iron will turns into midday rubber as \nyour stomach begins to growl and you sniff the air of the restau­\nrant you frequent for lunch. What can you do with things to help \nkeep you on track? \nPack a sensible lunch first thing in the morning when your will \nis strong. Ta ke no money with you. That way it won't be easy to \ncave in to your weaker, afternoon wishes. By structuring around \nyour self-control cycles, you heighten the power of your stronger \nmotives while lessening the blow of you weaker mome nts. \nSchedule crucial conversations when you're feeling confident. \nPractice befurehHnd. Ta ke nutes. Set up your office the way you\n\f\n226 CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS \nwould like. Anned with smart timing and material support, \nyou're far more likely to step up to tough problems effectively. \nBuild in Cues \nTo remind yourself to use your new skills, create helpful cues. \nMark hot spots. People who go through stress-reduction train­\ning learn to mark physical items that are closely linked to their \nsources of tension. People who freak out in traffic put a small red \ncircle on their steering wheel. Individuals who are constantly in \na rush put one on their watch. \nWhen it comes to the tough conversations you face, you might \nwant to make use of small visual cues as well. Place one on the \ncomputer that spits out results that drive you nuts. Build a cue \ninto your copy of the agenda of any meeting that typically serves \nup tough problems. \nSet aside a time. Perhaps the best way to remind yourself to \nuse your new skills is to set aside a time each day to walk around \nin search of both successes and problems. When you see a suc­\ncess, celebrate. When you encounter a problem, bring your best \ndialogue tools into play. \nRead reactions. If you're not doing a good job of holding cru­\ncial conversations, the results are going to be right in front of \nyou. If you see that you're getting off track, back up and start \nover. Use real-life cues (e.g., the other person's jaw tenses, he or \nshe clams up, etc.) to remind yourself that maybe it's time to try \na new tactic. If necessary, apologize. Move to an earlier place in \nthe discussion and follow the process. \nBuild in permanent reminders. Order a poster of the model, \nplace it on the wall, and look at it each morning as you start the day. \nCarry a reminder. Along with the poster, order a set of cue \ncards you can tuck into your purse or shirt pocket.\n\f\nCHANGE YOUR LIFE 227 \nA DIG ITAL ASSIST \nWe've tried to include in this book everything you'll need to con­\nduct crucial conversations. Our goal was to provide a complete, \nstand-alone tool for personal change. Nevertheless, when it \ncomes to improving social interactions, the digital domain has a \nlot to offer as well. Audio, video, and other digital tools can \nenhance your learning experience. \nAs an additional resource, we invite you to our website. There \nyou'll find a variety of tools for helping you transform the printed \nword into daily actions. Digital tools include conceptual, behav­\nioral, and cuing tools. \nConceptual Tools \nWatch. To give you live-action views of the skills we cover, we've \nadded video examples to our website. Vi sit us at www .crucial­\nconversations .com and check out video clips for specific skills. \nListen . Many people enjoy listening to audiotapes or CDs as \nthey commute to and from work each day. We've put together an \naudio mas tery course that not only reviews the material chapter \nby chapter, but also provides audio examples of what the skills \nsound like when put into action. Move your knowledge from the \nabstract to the concrete as you hear how the theories translate \ninto words and the words build into usable scripts. \nBehavioral Tools \nIf you'd like to practice specific skills with the aid of a role-play \ntool, go to our website and check out Free Resources to down­\nload role-play rehearsals. Print out the role plays and then work \nwith a partner until you've mastered the skill."
