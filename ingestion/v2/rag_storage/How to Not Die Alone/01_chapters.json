    "raw_text": "AUTHOR’S NOTE\nWhen it comes to academic research, here’s the bad news: Most studies to date\nfocused primarily on cis heterosexual couples. Fortunately, when researchers\nhave studied LGBTQ+ relationships, they’ve found they share many of the same\nproblems—and bene\u0000t from much of the same advice—covered in the existing\nresearch.\nIn writing this book, I interviewed people across the range of sexual\norientations and identities. I wanted to share LGBTQ+ love stories and dating\nexperiences. All of the stories in this book are true, although some of the\ncharacters are composites of several individuals. Names and identifying\ncharacteristics have been changed and dialogue has been re-created.\nAfter completing this manuscript I took a job as the Director of Relationship\nScience at the dating app Hinge. This role allows me to help millions of people\nlearn how to date more e\u0000ectively. All of the research and opinions in this book\nare completely my own.\n\f\nINTRODUCTION\nYou might think you shouldn’t have to buy a book on love. Love is something\ne\u0000ortless, natural, organic. You fall in love, you don’t think your way into it. It’s\na spontaneous chemical reaction, not a calculated decision.\nAnd yet here you are. Holding this book because you want to \u0000nd love, and\nso far it hasn’t worked out for you. Here’s the truth: While love may be a natural\ninstinct, dating isn’t. We’re not born knowing how to choose the right partner.\nAnd if we were, I wouldn’t have a job. I’m a dating coach and matchmaker. I\nstudied psychology at Harvard and have spent years researching human behavior\nand relationships. This work has led me to Intentional Love, my philosophy for\ncreating healthy relationships. Intentional Love asks you to view your love life as\na series of choices rather than accidents. This book is about being informed and\npurposeful—in acknowledging your bad habits, adjusting your dating\ntechniques, and approaching crucial relationship conversations.\nGreat relationships are built, not discovered. A lasting relationship doesn’t\njust happen. It is the culmination of a series of decisions, including when to get\nout there, whom to date, how to end it with the wrong person, when to settle\ndown with the right one, and everything in between. Make good decisions, and\nyou propel yourself toward a great love story. Make bad ones, and you veer o\u0000\ncourse, doomed to repeat the same harmful patterns over and over.\nSPOILER ALERT: WE’RE IRRATIONAL\nBut often we don’t understand why we make certain decisions, and that leads to\nmistakes. And those mistakes thwart our quest to \u0000nd love. Behavioral science\ncan help.\n\f\nBehavioral science is the study of how we make decisions. It o\u0000ers a way to\npeel back the layers of our mind, peek inside, and see why we tend to make\ncertain choices. Spoiler alert: We’re irrational. We often make decisions that are\nnot in our own best interest.\nThis happens in all realms of life. It’s why we say we want to save for\nretirement and then max out our credit cards on decorating our apartments. Or\ntell ourselves we’ll exercise more, then use our treadmill as a clothing rack. No\nmatter how often and or how earnestly we set goals, we get in our own way.\nFortunately, this irrationality isn’t random. Our brains lead us astray in\npredictable ways. Behavioral scientists use that knowledge to help people change\ntheir behavior, with the goal of making them happier, healthier, and wealthier.\nIn fact, for a while I took my knowledge of behavioral science and applied it\nat Google. I teamed up with behavioral science great Dan Ariely to run a group\nat Google called the Irrational Lab, a nod to his book Predictably Irrational.\nAnd while I loved working with Dan and the Irrational Lab team, studying\nhuman behavior and running experiments, I had other concerns on my mind. I\nwas single and in my early twenties. I was struggling with one of life’s most\nessential and common questions—how do we \u0000nd and sustain love?\nI’ve long been interested in studying dating, relationships, and sex. In college\nI studied the porn-watching habits of Harvard undergraduates for a paper I\nwrote called “Porn to Be Wild.” (Hint: Harvard students watch lots of porn.)\nFor my \u0000rst job at Google—years before I ran the Irrational Lab—I managed the\nGoogle Ads accounts for porn and sex toy clients, including Bangbros, Playboy,\nand Good Vibrations. People referred to our group by its uno\u0000cial name: “the\nPorn Pod.”\nI trace my curiosity about relationships to my own childhood. I had a happy,\nloving family growing up, but my parents suddenly divorced when I was\nseventeen. My “happily ever after” bubble burst, and I no longer took long-term\nmarital success for granted.\nAt the time, I was single. Dating apps had just come out, and I was spending\na lot of time swiping. I saw people all around me were struggling, too. We’d gone\nfrom the \u0000rst iPod (“a thousand songs in your pocket”) to ubiquitous\nsmartphones with a thousand possible Tinder dates in your pocket. Instead of\n\f\nmarrying Bobby or Belinda on our block, we could pick from thousands of\nsingles online.\nWith that in mind, I launched a side project called “Talks at Google: Modern\nRomance,” a speakers’ series that explored the challenges of modern dating and\nrelationships. I interviewed world-renowned experts about online dating,\ncommunication in the digital age, monogamy, empathy, and the secrets to a\nhappy marriage. Within hours, thousands of Googlers joined the Modern\nRomance email list to receive updates on these talks. Once the interviews went\nonline, millions of viewers watched on YouTube. Clearly, my friends and I were\nnot the only ones struggling.\nOne night a stranger came up to me and said, “I saw your talk on polyamory.\nI didn’t realize that relationships could work like that. It changed my whole\nworld.” At that moment I realized the impact of my work. I’d found my calling.\nBut I didn’t want to be just another love guru, o\u0000ering unscienti\u0000c advice. I\nthought, What if I take the behavioral science tools I honed at Google and apply\nthem to help people make better decisions in their romantic relationships?\nIRRATIONALLY EVER AFTER\nAfter almost a decade in tech, I quit my job and set out to help people \u0000nd and\nmaintain lasting relationships. I believe our natural errors in decision-making\ncause us to stumble. Behavioral science is the missing piece that can help people\nchange their behavior, break bad patterns, and \u0000nd lasting love.\nSelecting a partner is already an incredibly daunting task, one weighed down\nwith cultural baggage, bad advice, and societal and familial pressure. But until\nnow no one has applied behavioral science to help people \u0000nd love. Maybe that’s\nbecause we think love is a magical phenomenon that de\u0000es scienti\u0000c analysis. Or\nperhaps there’s fear of this critique: Who wants to be rational in love? But that’s\nnot it. I’m not trying to turn you into a hyper-rational supercomputer that\nanalyzes all possible matches and spits out a soul mate solution. I’m helping you\novercome your blind spots that are holding you back from \u0000nding love.\nBehavior change is a two-step process. First we’ll learn about the invisible\nforces driving your behavior, those errors in judgment that lead to costly"

    "raw_text": "HOW THIS BOOK CAN HELP\nIn this book you’ll discover you’re not alone. You’re not the only one struggling\nwith these doubts. You and your questions and concerns are totally normal.\nThere’s no certainty in relationships, but you can approach your decision-\nmaking in a more strategic way, pulling from research that understands the\nstrengths and weaknesses of our brains (and our hearts). Intentional Love is\ninformed by both relationship science (what works for long-term relationships)\nand behavioral science (how to get us to follow through on our intentions).\nI will give you a process. And process creates peace.\nIt’s worked for my clients, and I know it can help you.\nSection 1: Getting Ready\nWe’ll start with an exploration of why dating today is harder than ever before.\nThen you’ll take a quiz to \u0000gure out your dating blind spots—tendencies in\nyour life that are holding you back, likely without you even realizing it. Then I’ll\nexplain how your tendencies a\u0000ect your dating life and what you can do to\novercome them. Next we’ll talk about attachment theory and how it a\u0000ects\nwhom and how you love. I’ll set you straight about what to look for in a long-\nterm partner. It’s likely not what you think.\nSection 2: Getting Out There\nWe’ll take a deep dive into dating apps. I’ll help you identify and overcome the\ncommon pitfalls of modern dating. We’ll have you swiping better, meeting\npeople in real life (IRL), and going on dates that don’t feel like job interviews.\nYou’ll learn a better system to decide whom you should see again.\nSection 3: Getting Serious\nThen we’ll talk about how to handle major decision points in your relationship,\nincluding how to de\u0000ne the relationship (DTR) and determine if you should\nmove in together. I’ll walk you through how to decide if you should break up,\n\f\nhow to break up with someone, and how to get over heartbreak. If things\nprogress, you may \u0000nd yourself asking, “Should we get married?” The last\nchapter of this section will help you answer that question. Finally, we’ll end with\ntechniques to make your long-term relationship successful by investing daily\nattention and designing relationships that shift and change as the people in it\ngrow, too.\nCOMMIT TO TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT\nYou’re reading this book because you want to \u0000nd love. Perhaps you’ve dated a\nseries of people who haven’t brought out the best in you, who left you\ndisappointed and alone. Or maybe you haven’t been dating at all. School and\nwork and family and all the complexities of life have gotten in the way. But you\nknow deep down that you want to \u0000nd someone.\nI’m here to help you get to that next step. I want you to think of yourself as\nmy dating-coaching client. Here’s my ask of you: Commit to doing the exercises.\n(They really work!) And allow me the chance to change your mind. You’ve done\nthings your way for your entire life. Why not try something di\u0000erent? A lasting,\nloving relationship may very well be waiting for you on the other end.\n\f\nSECTION 1\nGETTING READY\n\f\nCHAPTER 1\nWHY DATING IS HARDER NOW\nTHAN EVER BEFORE\nHow to Understand the Challenges of Modern Dating\nEach generation faces its own set of challenges—wars, recessions, shoulder pads.\nThe same holds true for dating. While people of every era have bemoaned their\nlove lives, today’s singles might just be right: Dating is harder now than ever\nbefore. And the next time your mom pesters you about \u0000nding someone nice to\nsettle down with, you can tell her I said that.\nIn this book, I’ll o\u0000er solutions to some of life’s most di\u0000cult dating\ndecisions. But before I get to the tactical advice, I want to set the stage and\nexplain the factors conspiring against modern daters. If looking for love has left\nyou feeling incredibly stressed out, here’s why.\nWE SHAPE OUR OWN IDENTITIES\nReligion, community, and social class dictated the lives of our ancestors.\nExpectations were clear, and personal decisions were few. Based on where and\ninto what kind of family you were born, you knew, for example, that you’d work\nas a textile merchant, live in Bucharest, eat kosher food, and go to the synagogue.\nOr you’d work as a farmer, live on the outskirts of Shanghai, and eat livestock\nand crops from your land. When it came to \u0000nding a partner, the answer often\ncame down to the dowry—who could o\u0000er the best acres of land or the largest\ncaravan of camels.\nToday all these decisions are up to us. Modern life is a path that we must\nchart on our own. Whereas our predecessors didn’t have to weigh where to live\n\f\nor what to do for a living, we make those choices now. That gives us incredible\nfreedom to shape our identities—to pick Nashville over Atlanta, to choose\nwhether to work as a meteorologist or a mathematician—but that freedom\ncomes at the cost of certainty. Late at night, our faces lit by the blue glow of our\nsmartphones, we wonder, Who am I? and What am I doing with my life? The\ndark side of all this freedom and endless choice is the crippling fear that we’ll\nscrew up our lifelong pursuit of happiness. If we’re in charge, then we have only\nourselves to blame. We could fail, and then it would be our fault.\nAnd one of the biggest questions left up to us—a decision that used to be\nmade by our parents and our community—is Who should I pick as a romantic\npartner?\nWE HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS\nWe’re experiencing a seismic shift in dating culture. Dating itself only began in\nthe 1890s. Online dating started in 1994 with Kiss.com, followed shortly by\nMatch.com a year later. And we’ve been swiping for love for less than a decade. If\nit feels like we’re in the middle of a gigantic cultural experiment, it’s because we\nare.\nWe’re no longer limited to the single people we know from work or church or\nour neighborhood. Now we can swipe through hundreds of potential partners\nin a single sitting. But there’s a downside to these seemingly in\u0000nite options.\nPsychologists, including Barry Schwartz, professor emeritus at Swarthmore, have\nshown that while people crave choice, too many options can make us feel less\nhappy and more doubtful of our decisions. They call this the paradox of\nchoice.\nPeople are struggling. Like that obnoxious person in front of you in the fro-\nyo line who can’t pick a \u0000avor (“Can I try them all one more time?”), we’re\ncrippled by analysis paralysis. And this is especially true when it comes to\nchoosing a life partner.\nWE YEARN FOR CERTAINTY\n\f\nWhat’s the last purchase you researched online? Which electric toothbrush to\nbuy? Which wireless Bluetooth speakers to get your brother for his new\napartment? We live in an information-rich society that o\u0000ers the false comfort of\nresearch. It can feel like the perfect decision is only a few more Google searches\naway. Whether we’re selecting the most authentic taco place or the best-\nperforming vacuum cleaner, we can consult endless rankings and reviews. It feels\nlike if we can research all our choices, then we can select the right one.\nWe’ve gotten hooked on this feeling of certainty, and we crave it in our\nromantic lives. But when it comes to relationships, that kind of assurance\ndoesn’t exist. There is no “right answer” to questions like Who should I be with?\nand How much should I compromise? and Will they ever change? No amount of\nGoogling will reveal if James or Jillian will make a good spouse. We can’t achieve\ncomplete certainty before any big relationship decision—and luckily, we don’t\nhave to in order to be happy. Great relationships are built, not discovered. But\nour minds are often stuck in a trap, thinking that by combing through hundreds\nof options, we’ll be closer to knowing whether the one in front of us is “right.”\nSOCIAL MEDIA LEADS US TO COMPARE AND DESPAIR\nYears ago, people lived in communal villages. They witnessed other couples\nbeing a\u0000ectionate, \u0000ghting, and making up. There was no such thing as a private\nproblem. Today our primary view into other people’s relationships is staged,\ncurated, Instagram-\u0000ltered social media feeds—excited mid-hike engagement\nannouncements, vacation pictures with a snoozing baby strapped on someone’s\nchest. This leads us to feel like we’re the only ones experiencing heart-wrenching\nstruggles in our love lives (just in much less \u0000attering lighting). Feeling like\neveryone else’s relationship is perfect when yours is \u0000oundering (or nonexistent)\nexacerbates that pain. I \u0000nd this is especially true for men, who tend to have\nsmaller social networks and fewer people with whom they can share their fears.\nThey’re even less likely to talk to their friends about their problems and learn\nthat everyone, at one time or another, experiences relationship hardships.\nWE LACK RELATIONSHIP ROLE MODELS\n\f\nWe want to \u0000nd the best possible partner and build the best possible\nrelationship, yet many of us have witnessed few functional relationships\n\u0000rsthand, especially when we were young.\nDivorce rates peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. And while they’ve gone\ndown since then, many of us are what couples therapist Esther Perel calls “the\nchildren of the divorced and disillusioned.” Around 50 percent of marriages in\nthe United States end in divorce or separation, and about 4 percent of married\npeople report feeling miserable in their relationships. Put it all together, and a\nmajority of married people have either chosen to end their relationship or are\nenduring it unhappily.\nThis is a problem. Study after study demonstrates the power of role models.\nIt’s much easier to believe something is possible when you’ve seen someone else\ndo it, whether that’s running a four-minute mile or eating seventy-three hot\ndogs in under ten minutes (#lifegoals). For example, women are much more\nlikely to become inventors if they grew up in a zip code with many female patent\nholders. In fact, they’re more likely to patent in the same categories as older\nfemale inventors in their neighborhood.\nThe same is true with relationships. We all want to build lasting and ful\u0000lling\npartnerships, but it’s harder to do that when you lack relationship role models.\nMany of my clients confess fears around not knowing what the day-to-day looks\nlike in a strong relationship—How do healthy couples resolve conﬂict? How do\nhappy spouses make decisions together? How do you successfully spend the rest of\nyour life with one person?—because they didn’t observe those behaviors in their\nown parents.\nEven those of us with the best relationship intentions may struggle because\nmany of us haven’t seen a functional relationship in action.\nTHERE ARE FAR MORE WAYS TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP\nMany of the relationship questions we tackle today never would have crossed the\nminds of our camel-herding ancestors, such as Are we dating or just hooking up?\nor Should I break up now or wait until after wedding season is over? We agonize"

Many people suffer from dating blind spots—patterns of\nbehavior that hold them back from ﬁnding love, but which\nthey can’t identify on their own.\n2. I’ve categorized the most common blind spots into a\nframework called The Three Dating Tendencies. Each group\nstruggles with unrealistic expectations.\nThe Romanticizer has unrealistic expectations of\nrelationships. They want the soul mate, the happily ever\nafter—the whole fairy tale.\nThe Maximizer has unrealistic expectations of their\npartner. They love to explore their options and want to feel\nabsolutely conﬁdent they’re making the right decision.\nThe Hesitater has unrealistic expectations of themselves.\nThey feel like they’re not ready to date.\n3. Understanding your dating tendency helps you discover\nwhat’s holding you back and how you can overcome these\nblind spots."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 3\nDISNEY LIED TO US\nHow to Overcome the Romanticizer Tendency\nTwenty minutes into our \u0000rst session and the tears were already \u0000owing.\n“I know he’s out there,” Maya said. “He just hasn’t found me yet.”\nHe? Her soul mate. The peanut butter to her jelly. The one. Maya couldn’t\nstop talking about this man who would make all of her dreams come true. She\nbelieved the perfect guy was waiting for her just around the corner.\n“I want to meet him organically,” she explained when I asked about her\ncurrent approach to dating. “The apps feel too unromantic to me. Why mess\nwith fate?”\nMaya has long black hair that she spends an hour blow-drying every morning\nbefore work. When she tells a story, every detail seems slightly more dramatic\nbecause she lifts her dark eyebrows in surprise or grins to show her sparkling\nteeth. (Makes sense—she’s a dentist who runs her own practice.) She’s the child\nof Iranian immigrants, and her parents are in year thirty-\u0000ve of what she\ndescribes as a “very happy marriage.” She wants what they have.\nShe’s had a few boyfriends—one in college, two since—but nothing’s stuck.\nShe’s always broken up with these guys. “When it’s right, I’ll know,” she says,\narching an eyebrow. She grew up watching and rewatching Disney movies like\nThe Little Mermaid on VHS, and is waiting for her happily ever after.\nMaya is a quintessential Romanticizer. Romanticizers believe that love is\nsomething that happens to you, and that the reason they’re single is they just\nhaven’t met the right person yet. Romanticizers might not consciously identify\nwith fairy tales, yet they expect their lives to resemble one. They believe the\nperfect person will walk into their lives one day. All they have to do is wait for\n\f\nthat moment. And once that Prince Charming or Cinderella appears, love will\nbe e\u0000ortless. Of course! Cue the Céline Dion soundtrack!\nTHE PROBLEM WITH FAIRY TALES\nWho cares if you’re a hopeless romantic? I do, and you should, too.\nIn behavioral science, we know mindset matters. Our attitudes and\nexpectations create the context for our experience, which in turn a\u0000ects how we\ninterpret information and make decisions.\nWhen it comes to romantic relationships, psychologist Renae Franiuk found\nthat people have either a soul mate mindset, the belief that relationship\nsatisfaction comes from \u0000nding the right person; or a work-it-out mindset, the\nbelief that relationship success derives from putting in e\u0000ort.\nUnsurprisingly, Romanticizers fall into the soul mate mindset category. This\nimpacts how they act at every stage of the relationship. First, it a\u0000ects the way\nthey approach \u0000nding a partner. When I asked Maya why she thought she was\nsingle, she said, “It just hasn’t happened to me yet.” In Maya’s mind, love is\nsomething that happens to you, like lightning striking. So why try?\nRomanticizers wait for love and won’t put e\u0000ort in to create love. (I once\nworked with a woman who would dress up for every \u0000ight in case her “future\nhusband” was on the same plane, but then refused to approach anyone lest she\nbe perceived as trying too hard.)\nSecond, this mindset in\u0000uences whom you’re willing to go out with. People\nwith soul mate beliefs tend to have a very speci\u0000c vision of how their partner will\nlook. When we met, Maya rattled o\u0000 a list of her future husband’s physical traits:\n“Light-haired, light-eyed. Fit. Muscular but not too muscular. Tasteful tattoos.\nMedium-length hair. Pretty face but slightly rugged, bad-boy-looking. Tall—\n\u0000ve-ten and up. Good hands, no short nails.”\nSince Romanticizers are con\u0000dent they know what their future partner will\nlook like, when they meet someone who doesn’t match that image, they won’t\ngive that person a chance. They end up missing out on great potential matches.\nWhen they start dating someone they believe is “the one,” their sky-high\nexpectations can propel the relationship forward. But when the couple hits an\n\f\ninevitable obstacle—say, for instance, a particularly heated \u0000ght—they give up\non the relationship rather than trying to overcome it.\nMaya’s Romanticizer tendency helps explain why she struggled in her\nprevious partnerships. “In all my relationships, I end up thinking, Wait a\nminute. Why is this so hard?” she said. “Love is supposed to be e\u0000ortless, right?\nThis can’t possibly be ‘the one.’ ”\nIn comparison, those with the work-it-out mindset believe that relationships\ntake e\u0000ort, that love is an action you take, not something that happens to you.\nPeople with the work-it-out mindset tend to fare better in relationships because\nwhen they stumble, they put in the work needed to get the relationship back on\ntrack, rather than giving up.\nIf you’re a Romanticizer who wants to \u0000nd a lasting relationship, it’s time to\nmove on from fairy tales and start a new chapter with a work-it-out mindset.\nOUR FAIRY-TALE EXPECTATIONS\nRomanticizers aren’t the only ones who think marriage holds the promise of a\ngreat love story \u0000lled with explosive passion. Many of us feel that way.\nBut it wasn’t always like this.\nIn fact, for most of history, the idea of marrying for love would have seemed\nsilly. Marriage was about economics and convenience. You married someone\nbecause their father’s land was adjacent to your father’s land. Or because you\nwere poor and someone o\u0000ered your family a dozen cows in exchange for your\nhand in marriage.\nAs marriage historian Stephanie Coontz explained, “Until the late eighteenth\ncentury, most societies around the world saw marriage as far too vital an\neconomic and political institution to be left entirely to the free choice of the two\nindividuals involved, especially if they were going to base their decision on\nsomething as unreasoning and transitory as love.”\nWe know from ancient poetry that humans have always experienced love. In\nthe four-thousand-year-old Sumerian “Love Song for Shu-Sin,” considered the\nworld’s oldest love poem, the author declares: “Lion, let me caress you / My\nprecious caress is more savory than honey.” (And I know what you’re thinking,\n\f\nbut no, that isn’t a Beyoncé lyric!) But for most of human history, love was\nsimply not part of the marriage equation. Love was something you might\nexperience outside of the marriage. Perhaps you’d have a love a\u0000air with a\nneighbor or develop a major crush on the local blacksmith.\nAlain de Botton studies how our views on love have changed over time. He’s\na philosopher who runs the School of Life, a crash course in how to design a\nmeaningful existence. He’s also written two profound novels on relationships—\nOn Love and The Course of Love.\nWhen I spoke with him, he explained how our ancestors used to view love:\n“It was seen as a very exciting moment, akin to a kind of illness, a kind of ecstatic\nmoment. Love stood outside of ordinary experience… almost like a religious\nvisitation. And it might have occurred to someone only once in their life. It was\nnot generally seen to be something that you should act upon in any practical\nway. You let it wash over you, you let it guide an intense summer in your youth,\nbut you certainly didn’t marry according to it.”\nIt wasn’t until around 1750 that the idea of marrying for love took hold. It all\ndates back to the age of Romanticism, an ideological movement that began in\nEurope, with philosophers waxing poetic about love, and eventually took over\nthe world. Romanticism elevated love from “a kind of illness” to the new model\nfor what we have come to expect from long-term relationships. The Industrial\nRevolution propelled this model’s adoption by mainstream society. With greater\nmechanization and more widespread wealth, marriages could \u0000nally focus more\non personal ful\u0000llment than on meeting basic needs.\nSeveral centuries later, Romanticism still rules our ideas about love. Take a\nlook at this list of Romantic ideals. How many of these do you relate to?\nLove is a gut feeling. You know it when you feel it.\nWhen we meet our soul mate, we will feel an immediate attraction to\nthem. We will be attracted only to them, and vice versa.\nOur soul mate will intuitively understand us and know what we need\nbefore we do."

Bad or infrequent sex (or worse,\nin\u0000delity) means the relationship is doomed.\nIt’s not sexy to talk about money.

    "raw_text": "foster children. She’s a model with a PhD. This person has every positive quality\nthey want and none of the bad ones.\nIn animated Disney movies, people fall in love without even knowing each\nother. In The Little Mermaid, all Prince Eric knew about Ariel was that she was\nan attractive redhead with the upper-body strength to pull him safely to shore\nwhen his boat capsized. And he loved her for that? In Cinderella, the heroine\nfalls for the prince because he can dance and makes an e\u0000ort to return lost items\nto their rightful owner. Seems a little shallow, if you ask me.\nWork-it-out mindset shift\nEven Prince Charming has morning breath.\nNo one is perfect, including you. Don’t know what I’m talking\nabout? Think about the last time you really let someone down.\n(If you’re having trouble thinking of your ﬂaws, try giving your\nsiblings a call for inspiration. I’m sure they’d be more than\nhappy to remind you.)\nIt’s time to give up on this idea of perfection.\nLike Maya, you may have in your mind a vision of your future\nwife or husband. Perhaps this is informed by an early crush on\nthe boy across the street or your favorite movie star. It’s time\nto realize that the package this person comes in might be\ndifferent from what you were expecting. Maybe this person is\nshorter or taller or rounder or slimmer or darker or lighter or\nhairier or smoother than you expected. That very narrow view\nof this person’s looks holds you back from seeing the\npossibilities in front of you. If you’re not perfect, why should\nthis person be? Stop the double standard: You’re not a movie\nstar. (And if you are, cool! Thanks for reading my book!)\nRomanticizer Intensiﬁer #2: Disney’s Happily Ever After\nSoul mate belief Disney perpetuates\nThe hard work of love is ﬁnding someone. Everything after that\nis easy.\n\f\nDisney movies depict everything a couple goes through leading up to the\nmarriage—the courtship, the con\u0000ict, the evil witch standing in their way. But\nonce they vanquish their foes and can \u0000nally be together, the couple’s challenge\nends. After that, happily ever after, right?\nWrong. I call this the Happily-Ever-After Fallacy—the false notion that the\nhard part of love is \u0000nding someone.\nWork-it-out mindset shift\nNo relationship is easy all the time. Even the healthiest, most\nrewarding marriages require effort.\nFinding someone can be hard, but often the real challenge\ncomes later. The hard part is the daily work you put in to grow\nand sustain a great relationship. The hard part is feeling\nexcited to see your spouse at the end of the day, after thirty\nyears and two kids, long after the honeymoon period is over.\nThe hard part is remembering why you love someone during all\nthe logistical, ﬁnancial, emotional, and spiritual challenges life\nthrows at you.\nRomanticizer Intensiﬁer #3: The Rom-Coms’ “Meet-Cute”\nSoul mate belief rom-coms perpetuate\nDon’t worry, love will ﬁnd you, and it’ll probably happen in a\nreally great meet-cute way you’ll want to tell your friends\nabout.\nRom-coms are Disney fairy tales for people old enough to buy their own\nmovie tickets. And who \u0000nd bumbling English men attractive. (Colin Firth is\nlike Brussels sprouts; you don’t appreciate him until you’re older.) We all know\nrom-coms are not real life. Yet they’ve still surreptitiously bored their way into\nour collective subconscious. Especially when it comes to the meet-cute. In a\nrom-com, the meet-cute is the hero and heroine’s \u0000rst encounter, and it often\nhappens as the two characters are just going about their day—visiting the\nfarmers’ market, for example. And you think that it could happen to you, too.\nYou’ll reach for that perfect-looking tomato at exactly the same moment when\n\f\nthe handsome stranger next to you goes for it, and BAM! your eyes meet. He\nexplains he needs the tomato to make his grandmother’s bruschetta\n(pronounced with the proper Italian \u0000ourish). You o\u0000er to let him keep it. He\nasks if he can buy you a cappuccino to thank you. You say yes. Eleven months,\none major \u0000ght, and one grand gesture later, he’s chasing you down the terminal\nat JFK Airport, \u0000anked by TSA agents, begging you not to get on your \u0000ight to\nSeoul for your new job at an advertising agency.\nThe rom-com promotes the idea that love \u0000nds you and not the other way\naround. That love at \u0000rst sight is real. That all you have to do is live your life (and\nconsume vast amounts of tomatoes while hanging out at the farmers’ market)\nand one day your future husband or wife will magically appear. While I\nacknowledge that people do meet in real life all the time—at parties, events, even\nprotests—the problem with this idea is that it gives people permission to be\noverly passive in their love lives.\nWork-it-out mindset shift\nLove takes work—from ﬁnding it to keeping it alive. Waiting\naround at the farmers’ market just won’t cut it. You need to put\nin effort to ﬁnd someone. (Don’t worry, I’ll show you how in\nSection 2.) The magic of a relationship doesn’t depend on a\nserendipitous or cinematic meeting. The magic lies in the fact\nthat two strangers come together and create a life. It’s not\nimportant where or how they met.\nRomanticizer Intensiﬁer #4: Social Media\nSoul mate belief social media perpetuates\nRelationships are effortless, sex-ﬁlled love fests (in great\nlighting).\nAt least Disney movies and rom-coms are up front about the fact that they’re\n\u0000ctional. Social media is in many ways a more dangerous culprit because its lies\ndisguise themselves as real life. On social media, we see curated images of the\nperfect relationship—from the romantic beach walk captured at sunset to the\n\f\nkiss over a masterfully plated homemade dinner. By contrast, we \u0000nd our own\npartnership lacking. We compare and despair.\nWork-it-out mindset shift\nFirst off, don’t believe what you see on Instagram. Images are\ncropped, blurred, and distorted to send a message. And when\nit comes to relationships, the pictures you see on social media\nare only one heavily ﬁltered view of that partnership. Just like\npeople don’t post pictures of themselves crying or picking their\nnose, no one puts up photos of blowout ﬁghts with their\ngirlfriend or nights spent wondering whether they should stay\nwith her. Social media tells us that everyone else is\nexperiencing a blissful, effortless, passionate, picture-perfect\nrelationship, which contributes to our sky-high expectations for\nour own partnership.\nRelationships go through periods of highs and lows. If\nyou’re working hard at your relationship, that’s a good sign, not\na bad one! Many hours of a marriage are spent on the\neveryday, rarely posted minutiae of life: changing dirty diapers,\ndoing laundry, and washing dishes. Love happens in these\nmoments, not in spite of them. Love is so much more than a\nﬁltered photo captured at sunset.\nFROM FAIRY-TALE ROMANCE TO REAL-LIFE LOVE\nI explained to Maya how Disney, rom-coms, and social media had triggered her\nRomanticizer tendencies. If she wanted to \u0000nd love, she needed to change her\nexpectations.\nShe crossed her arms over her chest. “Do you get it?” she asked me, her\neyebrows furrowed. “I feel like you’re telling me to give up on my dream. I have\nthis vision of love, and now you’re saying it doesn’t exist. That I have to settle or\ngive up. Why do other people get to have this epic relationship and I don’t? Why\nam I not good enough?”\nI did get it. “Maya, no, that’s not it,” I said. “I want you to be open to a love\nthat is di\u0000erent from the one you thought you’d have. I’m not telling you to\n\f\nsettle. That would imply that Prince Charming is the prize and I’m asking you\nto date a runner-up. But that’s not true, because Prince Charming doesn’t exist.”\nSame goes for you: It’s time you gave up on Prince Charming and started\nlooking for someone real. Let’s call him Larry.\nBecause that’s the name of the guy Maya wound up with. She met him when\nshe was \u0000lling in for another dentist who went on vacation. Through our work\ntogether, she learned to let go of her soul mate beliefs, which were holding her\nback from \u0000nding real love. Her now live-in boyfriend is nothing like she\nexpected. He’s a divorced dad with two little kids.\n“He slouches, he wears sweaters with holes in them,” she said. “He doesn’t\nopen doors for me.” She smiled, surprised that she no longer cared about those\nsuper\u0000cial traits. “But he makes me laugh. He’s kind, and I feel like myself\naround him. He makes me feel smart and funny. I know it sounds cheesy, but\nI’m honestly much happier than I’ve ever been.”\nThey \u0000ght. About where to spend Thanksgiving, whether or not they really\nneed to go to her frenemy’s wedding, and the amount he spends on his dog’s\nsuper-premium food. But now Maya believes those \u0000ghts are a sign that things\nare right, not wrong.\n“We’re passionate! We care about stu\u0000. We talk openly. We’re not the same\nperson, so of course we’re going to \u0000ght. I know all relationships require work.\nAnd I’m choosing to invest in this one.”"

The ability to shift your mindset from\nsoul mate to work-it-out beliefs could mean the difference\nbetween ﬁnding a life partner or not.\nPeople with soul mate beliefs reject promising partners\nbecause they don’t match their vision for what love\nshould look and feel like. They think that love will just\nhappen to them. They expect love to be effortless. If it’s\nnot, they must be with the wrong person.\nPeople with a work-it-out mindset know that relationships\ntake effort and that building a successful relationship is a\nprocess.\n2.

But he\nnever felt any closer to knowing what he really wanted.\nHe couldn’t stop himself from asking, Could I be 5 percent happier with\nsomeone else?\nMAXIMIZERS VERSUS SATISFICERS\nSteven is a Maximizer. Maximizers obsess over making the best possible\ndecision. American economist, political scientist, and cognitive psychologist\nHerbert A. Simon \u0000rst described this personality pro\u0000le in a 1956 paper.\nAccording to Simon, Maximizers are a special type of perfectionist. They’re\ncompelled to explore every possible option before they feel like they can choose.\nYet this compulsion becomes daunting, and ultimately unfeasible, when they\nface a vast number of possibilities.\nOn the other end of the spectrum are Satis\u0000cers (a portmanteau of “satisfy”\nand “su\u0000ce”). They have standards, but they aren’t overly concerned that there\nmight be something better out there. They know their criteria, and they hunt\nuntil they \u0000nd the “good enough” option. It’s not that they settle; they’re simply\n\u0000ne making a decision once they’ve gathered some evidence and identi\u0000ed a\nsatisfactory option.\nImagine you’re on a two-hour \u0000ight. The plane takes o\u0000 and you begin\nscrolling through the movie options. Do you A) select the \u0000rst movie that\nappeals to you? Within \u0000ve minutes, you’re reclining in your seat, eyes glued to\nGood Will Hunting. Or do you B) spend twenty-\u0000ve minutes scrolling through\nevery single new release, comedy, drama, documentary, and foreign \u0000lm, as well\nas all the TV shows, before committing to the absolute best option?\nIf you chose A, you’re likely a Satis\u0000cer. If you selected B, you’re clearly a\nMaximizer. (You can fall on the spectrum between these extremes, or you may be\na Maximizer in some parts of your life and a Satis\u0000cer in others.)"

    "raw_text": "Maximizers obsess over their decision-making. They trust that careful analysis\nwill ultimately make their life better. But that’s not true. Not only are Satis\u0000cers\nable to make good decisions, they tend to wind up happier about them. That’s\nbecause—and it’s worth repeating—satis\u0000cing is not about settling. Satis\u0000cers\nmay have very high standards and stop only after those standards have been met.\nThe di\u0000erence is, once they stop, they don’t worry about what else is out there.\nMaximizers, on the other hand, may \u0000nd an option that meets their standards,\nbut they feel compelled to explore all possibilities.\nWhen it comes to relationships, Maximizers—like Steven—mistakenly\nbelieve that with the right amount of exploration, they can \u0000nd the perfect\nperson and have absolute con\u0000dence in their decision. But this perfect person\n(and complete certainty) doesn’t exist. That’s why maximizing leads to anguish,\ndelays in decision-making, and missed opportunities. In other words, it’s better\nto be a Satis\u0000cer.\nWHY ARE MAXIMIZERS LIKE THIS?\nAnxiety plagues Maximizers. It’s not just FOMO (fear of missing out). They\nalso su\u0000er from the less catchy FOMTWD (fear of making the wrong decision).\nThey think maximizing will help them make the perfect choice and alleviate\ntheir anxiety. But FOMTWD creates an immense amount of pressure. Anything\nless than perfection feels like failure.\nThis happens to me when I travel. Even if a trip unfolds almost perfectly,\nwhen I make a mistake—like booking a hotel far away from the center of town\n—I can’t help but feel like I failed. I think, If only I’d done just a little more\nresearch. I have to \u0000ght to prevent this feeling from ruining the trip.\nHardly anything exacerbates the Maximizer tendency more than choosing a\nlong-term partner. Maximizers fear making a mistake. What if I get divorced and\nhave to raise my children on my own? What if I dread coming home after work\nbecause I have nothing to say to my wife? What if I’m so bored that I have an\naﬀair?\nFor most of human history (and to this day, in many societies), our families,\ncommunities, or religious leaders told people what to do—what to wear, what to\n\f\neat, how to act, what to believe, and, yes, whom to marry. Now, in our\nincreasingly individualistic and secular culture, we each de\u0000ne our own identity.\nDo I eat meat? Do I work on Shabbat? Do I baptize my child? Do I get married in\na synagogue? Do I identify as a man or woman or neither?\nOur life, once scripted by culture, religion, and family, is now a blank page.\nThis grants us the freedom to express ourselves more fully. But we’re also\nburdened by the pressure to get it right. When we are the authors of our own\nstory and that story sucks, we have no one to blame but ourselves. No wonder\nwe can get trapped in analysis paralysis.\nWhen everything is up in the air—and up to us—we yearn to stand on solid\nground. “I want to feel a hundred percent certain before I walk down the aisle,”\nSteven told me.\nBut that’s exactly the problem. Steven believes it’s possible to “pro/con list”\nhis way to the correct answer, no di\u0000erent from purchasing the optimal vacuum\n(Dyson V11 Animal, 160 \u0000ve-star reviews) or planning the optimal day (\u0000ve\na.m. sur\u0000ng, co\u0000ee from the little stand that people love but no one knows\nabout, sprint triathlon, meeting up with two di\u0000erent friends, beach meditation,\nhome-cooked meal, and board games). But this assumes there is a right answer\nfor whom to marry. And there’s not.\nTHE PROBLEM WITH MAXIMIZING\nDo Maximizers obtain better outcomes?\nWe can think about this question in two ways—the objective result and the\nsubjective experience. In other words, the quality of your choice and how you feel\nabout it.\nImagine you’re a Maximizer who’s sick of spending money on your morning\nco\u0000ee. You spend hours conducting research into home espresso makers. You\nread Amazon reviews and study product comparison websites like Wirecutter.\nYou select Wirecutter’s number one pick: the elegant Breville Bambino Plus. As\nsoon as it arrives, you notice it doesn’t \u0000t as easily into your kitchen as you\nthought it would. You wonder if you should’ve gotten a smaller one. Just as the\n\f\nreview warns, it doesn’t capture the brightness of your co\u0000ee bean. As your cup\nbrews, you stew, and regret not going with a di\u0000erent option.\nMeanwhile, your Satis\u0000cer friend is also on the market for an espresso maker.\nShe goes to the mall, pops into a Nespresso store, tells an employee what she’s\nlooking for, and walks out with a reasonably priced machine. She tells you how\nmuch she adores the process of making her daily latte, from selecting the fun-\ncolored pods to steaming her milk.\nIn this scenario, you selected the best espresso machine available. Several\nwebsites compared your machine to hers, and yours won. But who feels better\nabout the decision?\nSatis\u0000cers report feeling happier with their choices, even when they select an\nobjectively worse option. (I mean, come on. Your friend’s Nespresso machine\ndidn’t even make Wirecutter’s top picks!) That’s because Maximizers constantly\nsecond-guess themselves. They su\u0000er doubly: \u0000rst in the agony leading up to the\ndecision, and again every time they worry they’ve made the wrong one.\nPsychologist and The Paradox of Choice author Barry Schwartz explains that\nwhat separates Maximizers and Satis\u0000cers is not the quality of their decisions, it’s\nhow these decisions make them feel: “Maximizers make good decisions and end\nup feeling bad about them. Satis\u0000cers make good decisions and end up feeling\ngood.”\nWhat’s your goal? To have the world’s best co\u0000ee machine or to be happy? If\nit’s happiness you’re after, it’s the subjective experience, not the objective result,\nthat really matters. While the quality of co\u0000ee is important, how we feel about\nthat co\u0000ee is paramount.\nTHE WISDOM OF SATISFICING\nMaximizers want to turn over every stone before they make a decision. That\npresents a particularly tough challenge when it comes to dating. You can’t go out\nwith every eligible single in your city, let alone the whole world. If you hope to\nget married or commit to a long-term relationship, eventually, you’ll need to\nmake a decision with the information you have.\n\f\nIf you’re a Maximizer, that idea might make you nervous. What if you aren’t\nhappy with what you pick? Here’s the good news: We have an incredible tool\nworking on our behalf to make us happy—our brain! Once we commit to\nsomething, our brain helps us rationalize why it was the right choice.\nRationalization is our ability to convince ourselves we did the right thing.\nImagine you buy an expensive winter coat that you can return within thirty\ndays. You take it home and weigh its pros and cons. Even if you keep the coat,\nyou can’t shake that list of cons in your head. But when you buy a coat on \u0000nal\nsale, you immediately commit to liking it. You can’t return it, so why worry\nabout its drawbacks? That’s the power of rationalization. Embrace it.\nThis works for dating, too. When you commit to someone, your brain will do\nits best to convince you it was a good decision. Satis\u0000cers inherently understand\nthis idea—and bene\u0000t from it.\nNow, perhaps you’re thinking: I’m not looking to make a merely “good”\ndecision. I refuse to settle. But this is a common misunderstanding about\nsatis\u0000cing. Remember, Satis\u0000cers can have very high standards. They may look\naround for a while until they \u0000nd an option that meets their expectations. The\ndi\u0000erence is, once they \u0000nd something that meets their standards, they are happy\nwith it. They don’t wonder what else is out there.\nAnd that’s why I want you to work toward becoming a Satis\u0000cer. The best\nchoice of all is choosing to be happy.\nTHE SECRETARY PROBLEM\nYou can learn to date like a Satis\u0000cer by studying the decision-making riddle\nknown as the Secretary Problem. Imagine you are hiring a secretary. And let’s\nbe sure to make him a male secretary, because I know you were envisioning a\nwoman and #fuckthepatriarchy. There are a hundred possible candidates whom\nyou must interview one by one. After each interview, you decide whether to hire\nthat person or keep looking. If you reject a person, he’s gone. You can’t change\nyour mind later and hire him.\nHow should you maximize your chances of picking the best candidate? You\ndon’t want to decide too early in the process, because you might miss out on a\n\f\nstrong candidate at the end of the line. But you don’t want to make it too far\nwithout choosing, because what if the \u0000nal options aren’t very good? It turns\nout there’s a mathematically correct answer to this problem. You should\ninterview 37 percent of the candidates and then pause. Identify the best person\nfrom this \u0000rst group. Now you have a meaningful benchmark. After evaluating\nthe \u0000rst 37 percent, you should be prepared to hire the \u0000rst candidate who is\nbetter than the standout from the \u0000rst group.\nThis logic applies to dating, too. In the Secretary Problem, you know there\nare a hundred possible candidates. In dating, you have no idea how many\npossible matches are out there. Even if you did, you couldn’t meet all of them.\nLife, logistics, and geography all get in the way.\nInstead of thinking about the total number of people you might date,\nconsider how long you’re likely to actively look for a partner. Apply the rule of\n37 percent to that time period. In the book Algorithms to Live By, authors Brian\nChristian and Tom Gri\u0000ths discuss a single man who wants to get married.\n“Assuming that his search would run from ages eighteen to forty, the 37% rule\ngave age 26.1 as the point at which to switch from looking to leaping.”\nThat means that by the age of 26.1, he should set a meaningful benchmark\nfrom his \u0000rst 8.1 years of dating—that is, the single best person he’s dated thus\nfar. He should then marry the next person he meets whom he likes more than\nthat benchmark.\nI explained the Secretary Problem to Doug, a software engineer who’d\nrecently sold his business to a major tech company. Doug had been in several\nthree- to six-month relationships. He always found something lacking with the\nwomen he dated. This one laughed at his jokes, but she wasn’t funny. That one\nworked too hard. The next one didn’t work hard enough.\nWhen I began to describe the idea of the benchmark, he nodded and\ninterrupted me. “I get it. I get it,” he said. “I’m thirty-one, and I’ve probably\nalready dated someone who would make a great wife.” It clicked.\nI followed up with a homework assignment. “Put together a spreadsheet of all\nthe women you’ve gone out with in the last year. Make a column for their name,\nhow you met them, how you felt when you were with them, and what values\n\f\nyou shared. You can include other details, too, but I don’t want a laundry list of\ntheir \u0000aws or a ranking of their hotness.”\n“I’ll do it.”\nDuring our next session, Doug pulled up his laptop and showed me his work.\n“Brielle,” he said as the page loaded. “She’s the one.”\n“The one? You mean like the one the one?” I asked. (I know: I temporarily\nsuspended my distaste for that term.)\n“Not the one I’m going to marry, but the benchmark. She was smart, funny,\nfun to be with, ambitious, and pretty. Ugh, why did I break up with her?\nAnyway, it’s too late for that. Brielle is my benchmark. I’m going to commit to\nthe next girl who I like as much or more than Brielle.”\nNow it’s your turn. To determine your dating window, count the number of\nyears from when you started dating to when you’d like to enter a long-term\nrelationship. Now, what’s 37 percent of that number? Add that to the age when\nyou started dating. That’s your 37 percent mark. If you’re in your thirties, you’ve\nprobably already passed it. Complete the assignment I gave Doug to determine\nyour benchmark partner.\nDon’t worry. I’m not telling you to marry the next person you go out with,\nnor am I implying that it’s too late if you’re past the 37 percent mark. I’m merely\nsuggesting that you likely already have enough data to generate a reasonable,\nwell-informed benchmark. You do not need more research. The next time you\nmeet someone whom you like as much or more than that benchmark, commit\nto them."

    "raw_text": "GENDER INEQUALITY AND RELATIONSHIP TIMELINES\nI am a feminist. I believe men and women are and should be equal.\nHowever, that does not mean we are the same. We’re separated by\nreal biological diﬀerences in our reproductive systems. (I\nrecognize these categories don’t contain everyone and that trans\nand genderqueer folks face unique challenges while dating.)\nWomen’s fertility declines in our thirties. Men can have kids\nuntil their late sixties and beyond. (Robert De Niro was sixty-eight\nyears old when his youngest child was born—though I’d\nencourage any man who thinks he has inﬁnite time to imagine\nplaying catch when he’s seventy, with arthritic hands.)\nTo my beloved female readers: If you want to have kids, and you\nhope to carry them yourself, it’s important to incorporate that\ngoal when you consider your dating window. While you don’t need\na partner to have a kid, this may aﬀect the age by which you’d like\nto ﬁnd someone.\nAlthough it’s expensive, you may want to consider egg\nfreezing. While it’s certainly not a guarantee that you can have\nkids later, it may buy you some time. I froze embryos, fertilized by\nmy partner’s sperm, the month I turned thirty-one because we\nweren’t ready to have kids and wanted to put the decision on ice.\nPun intended.\nAs unfair as it is, you will likely hit that 37 percent mark before\nmen your own age. I really wish it weren’t this way. But I’d rather\nyou recognize the situation and plan for it, rather than being\ncaught oﬀ guard later in life and wishing you’d made diﬀerent\nchoices.\nThis brings me back to Steven, who was still asking himself: Could I be 5\npercent happier with someone else? A few months after Gabby gave Steven her\nultimatum, she confronted him once more. He admitted he’d made no steps\ntoward buying a ring.\n\f\nShe told him it was over. Enter moving boxes, breakup sex, new pro\u0000le\npictures on social media.\nSteven sat alone in his half-empty apartment. No couch, no TV, no dresser.\nJust a bed, some chairs, and his painstakingly researched ultralight camping gear.\nAt that point, I didn’t expect to hear from Steven again. Based on my\nexperience with other Stevens, I \u0000gured he’d meet new women—people he’d get\nexcited about and then leave when he didn’t feel 100 percent certain about them.\nThen, about a year later, he called me.\n“I met someone,” he told me. “Someone I want to spend the rest of my life\nwith.”\nI was surprised but thrilled. “Tell me more.”\n“The other weekend we went away together. We rode bikes, we cooked, we\nhad sex. And I just felt like this was the person I was going to marry.”\nI was so happy to hear that he was happy. But I had to ask: “What about\nthose Steven voices in your head, wondering, Could I be ﬁve percent happier?”\nHe laughed. “Look, it hasn’t been easy. But I worked on that. I’m grateful for\nwhat I have with her. I’m not wondering what I could have with someone else.\nAll I know is that I could build a life with this person. An amazing life.”\nSteven had learned to satis\u0000ce. To feel uncomfortable with uncertainty. To\nmake a decision based on a less than exhaustive search. Through this work, he’d\nchanged the punctuation of his life: from the anxious question mark of a\nMaximizer to the con\u0000dent period of a Satis\u0000cer.\nAt \u0000rst I thought Steven’s story would serve as a warning: Don’t let perfect\nbe the enemy of great. But now I can share it as a tale of victory. Maximizers,\ngive yourself the gift of happiness. Give yourself the gift of satis\u0000cing.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Maximizers obsess over making the right decision. They\nwant to explore every possible option before they make a\nchoice. Even when they decide, they constantly wonder what\nthey’re missing out on. Satisﬁcers ﬁgure out what they want\nand stop looking once they’ve met their criteria. They don’t\nsettle, they merely stop worrying what else is out there once\nthey’ve made a decision.\n2. Research shows that Satisﬁcers tend to be happier, because\nin the end, satisfaction comes from how you feel about your\ndecision, not the decision itself.\n3. The current dating climate creates Maximizers out of many\nof us. No one ever seems good enough, and we wonder if we\ncould be happier with someone else. Maximizing tendencies\nin relationships can lead to mental anguish, costly delays in\ndecision-making, and missed opportunities.\n4. Maximizers assume there is a right answer for whom to be\nwith. And there’s not. We can apply lessons from the\nSecretary Problem to see that we likely already have enough\ndating experience to select a great partner. This knowledge\ncan help us commit without worrying about what else is out\nthere. The power of rationalization can also help us embrace\nour decisions."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 5\nDON’T WAIT, DATE\nHow to Overcome the Hesitater Tendency\nI met my new client Shea on a hidden patio in downtown San Francisco, several\nblocks from his o\u0000ce. He was thirty-\u0000ve and over six feet tall. (He later told me\nthis gives him a big advantage in the Jewish dating market in San Francisco.)\nI knew very little about Shea going into the meeting. He seemed con\u0000dent\nand charming. Sitting at our table while he stood in line to order us co\u0000ees, I\ntried to guess why he’d contacted me for help. Was he having trouble deciding\nwhom to date? Did he need help ending a bad relationship? Was he trying to get\nback out there after a tough breakup?\nHe walked back over and handed me my latte. “Well, I guess I’ll start at the\nbeginning,” he said. “I’ve never had a girlfriend. Okay, maybe one in high school,\nbut not since then.”\nI was surprised to hear how little dating experience he had. “Why do you\nthink that is?”\n“I’ve never felt ready,” he said. “First I wanted to make sure I had my job in\norder. Then I found a great job, but I wanted to make sure I had enough money\nsaved to support a wife. I got close, but then I started therapy and wanted to\nwork on myself \u0000rst. I recently switched jobs, and now I feel like I won’t be ready\nto date until work is more settled again.”\nHe explained that he ultimately wanted a wife and a family, but he didn’t\nthink he was ready for that yet. He’d reached out to me only because his parents\nhad pressured him to get some help.\nYou might be nodding along, thinking, That makes sense. Good for him. He’ll\ndate when he’s ready.\n\f\nExcept when I pushed him for more details, I discovered that Shea was ready.\nHe had worked as a lawyer at a big \u0000rm for ten years and was \u0000nancially stable.\nHe was self-aware and mature. He had hobbies (he played guitar—poorly, he\nsaid). He had friends. He enjoyed a close relationship with his family.\nI’ve encountered a lot of clients like Shea. They seem like they’d be a great\ncatch, but they aren’t actively dating. I call this bunch the Hesitaters. They\ncome to me because they feel like they should be dating, but they’re having\ntrouble taking action. When I ask why they haven’t been going on dates, their\n“I’ll be ready when” excuses start tumbling out:\n“I’ll be ready when I lose ten pounds.”\n“I’ll be ready when I get promoted.”\n“I’ll be ready once I \u0000nish grad school.”\n“I’ll be ready when I have new pictures for my dating pro\u0000le.”\n“I’ll be ready when things calm down at work.”\nWe all want to improve along some dimension. But these aspirations can turn\ninto excuses. And I get it—dating is scary. Fear paralyzes the Hesitaters: fear of\nrejection, fear of failure, fear of not being good enough. No wonder they avoid\ndating. You can’t fail at something you never attempt, right?\nBut people who wait until they are 100 percent ready underestimate what\nthey’re missing out on.\nWHY IT’S A MISTAKE TO WAIT\nYou’ll never be 100 percent ready for anything, including—and perhaps\nespecially—dating.\nThe urge to wait until you feel fully self-actualized is understandable. What if\nyou meet your ideal mate too early and they reject you?\nFor Hesitaters, there’s a story in your head that one day you’ll wake up and\nfeel ready. That story is \u0000ction. That’s not how life works. Everyone feels\n\f\nawkward sometimes. Most people feel nervous in high-pressure situations. Many\nof us have a part of ourselves we don’t want to reveal to others. And yet these\nvery same people still go out on dates and kiss people and fall in love and break\nup and fall in love again and get married. Eventually, you just have to get out\nthere and start dating, imperfect as you are. Everyone else is imperfect, too—\neven the person you’ll end up with.\nAnd, by the way, let’s say you do reach this so-called state of perfection you’ve\nenvisioned for yourself—by earning that promotion or shedding ten pounds—\nand then enter into a relationship. Will you worry that their love is conditional?\nThat they’ll leave you if you lose your job, tailspin, develop a ravenous cheddar\ncheese addiction, and gain twenty-\u0000ve pounds?\nWhen you wait to date, you’re missing out on more than you think.\nEconomists often refer to the opportunity cost of decisions—the price you pay\nwhen you choose one option over another. If you’re facing two mutually\nexclusive choices, Option A and Option B, your opportunity cost is what you\ngive up from Option A if you choose Option B, and vice versa. A quick example\nhelps illustrate the concept.\nImagine you’re deciding between Option A, attending grad school, or\nOption B, continuing to work in your current job. The tuition plus living\nexpenses for two years adds up to two hundred thousand dollars. If I asked you\nhow much grad school costs, what would you say? “Two hundred thousand\ndollars,” right?\nWrong. You’ve neglected to include the opportunity cost. If you go to grad\nschool, you can’t keep working full-time, so the total cost of grad school includes\nforgoing your current salary. Therefore, the real cost of grad school is two\nhundred thousand dollars in tuition and expenses plus the money you would’ve\nmade over two years if you’d worked instead of going to school. That’s two\nhundred thousand plus two times your current annual salary.\nOr let’s say you’re deciding between going to your friend Samantha’s\nbirthday party at a bar or your coworker David’s housewarming party. When\nyou consider the cost of going to Samantha’s party, it’s not just about the time it\nwould take to get there, the money you might spend at the bar, or how bad your\n\f\nhangover might feel the next day. It’s also the opportunity cost of not being able\nto get to know David and your coworkers better at his party.\nWhen it comes to dating, Hesitaters wait until they have more con\u0000dence,\nmore money, more whatever. But they’re neglecting the opportunity cost of not\nstarting.\nMISSING OUT ON THE CHANCE TO LEARN\nThe \u0000rst opportunity cost is losing the chance to learn. You can’t \u0000gure out\nwhat you like (and what you don’t) if you don’t date di\u0000erent people. So much\nof dating is iterative—making incremental changes as you learn over time—\nespecially because you’re probably wrong about what you like or value in a\npartner (more on that in Chapter 8). You think you want something, you try it,\nturns out you don’t want it, so you learn and move on. Maybe you fall for\nsomeone mysterious: the aloof bohemian Cirque du Soleil performer who once\nhitchhiked across Madagascar and sews their own pants. After a few months of\ndating, though, you realize that while the mystique is attractive at \u0000rst, you want\na partner who is warm and a\u0000ectionate (and owns nice pants). If you’re not\ngoing on dates, you’re not getting closer to knowing the kind of person you\nwant to be with long term.\nTake my client Jing, for example. At thirty-one, she’s dating for the \u0000rst time.\nHer family moved a lot when she was growing up, so she never established a\ngroup of lifelong friends, much less a girlfriend. In college, she was studious and\nshy. She made new friends, but the dating and mating rituals of college seemed\nimpossibly foreign to her. “I didn’t know how to \u0000irt,” she confessed. “I just\nnever learned.”\nAfter college, she joined an advertising agency as an intern. She worked her\nway up to lead copywriter. She transformed herself into someone she liked—\nsophisticated, funny, passionate—but she still didn’t date. She put o\u0000 trying\nbecause she already felt so behind.\nNow she realizes that her lack of experience complicates her search for a good\nmatch: “I missed out on experimentation. I don’t know my likes and dislikes.\nAnd now it feels a lot harder to \u0000nd a partner without that information.”"

    "raw_text": "GETTING IN YOUR DATING REPS\nHesitaters who delay getting out there also miss the opportunity to improve\ntheir dating skills. I’m constantly surprised by how many of my clients think\nthey should naturally know how to date. Dating is hard! And it takes time to\nmaster, just like anything else.\nI tell my clients they need to get in their reps. A “rep” is a single movement\n(or repetition) of an exercise. At the gym, you get stronger by doing multiple\nreps. In dating, you get stronger by going on more dates.\nWhen you wait to date, and sit at home thinking about how you’re not ready\nyet, someone like you is going on a \u0000rst date. They’re practicing their storytelling\nabilities, their listening skills, and their French-kissing technique. They’re getting\nin their reps.\nJing still feels like a beginner, she told me. “I’m making rookie mistakes when\nI’m supposed to be ready for the game of my life.” The fact is, everyone has to\nmake those rookie mistakes at \u0000rst. You’re going to make them no matter when\nyou start dating, so you might as well start making them now.\nDating is a bit like stand-up comedy (though hopefully with less heckling\nfrom strangers). They’re both an audience-based art. Comics often say that if\nthey’re at home coming up with jokes, that’s just writing. It’s not until they’re in\nfront of a crowd that they’re truly performing stand-up. Stand-up comics know\nthat no one brings the house down the \u0000rst time they step up to the mic; they\nneed to learn by doing. That’s one of the reasons up-and-coming comedians\nwork so hard to get stage time. Before her breakout Net\u0000ix comedy special, Baby\nCobra, Ali Wong went to multiple open mics every night, practicing her set over\nand over in small clubs.\nIt’s the same with dating. You need to practice asking interesting questions,\nexpressing yourself in a compelling way, and going in for a \u0000rst kiss. Those are\nyour reps. And you can’t work on any of these skills if you’re sitting around by\nyourself, “preparing.” The only way to get better at it is to actually date.\nOVERCOME YOUR HESITATION AND START DATING\n\f\nBehavioral science warns us of the dreaded intention-action gap, when we\nintend to do something but don’t take the steps to make it happen. Your\nintention is to start dating. But you may get stuck in the gap between wanting to\ndate and doing it. To help you get started, here are some techniques from the\nbehavioral science toolkit. They worked for Jing, who, after a number of\nbumbling \u0000rst dates and a handful of slightly less awkward second, third, and\nfourth ones, entered into a relationship with her \u0000rst boyfriend.\nStep 1: Make a deadline.\nDeadlines are one of the most e\u0000cient ways to motivate someone to take action.\nShort deadlines work especially well. Imagine you get an email from your bank\ntelling you to change your password. They don’t provide a deadline. How likely\nare you to do it? You might intend to change it, but since it seems like you can do\nit anytime, you’ll likely forget about it before taking action. You’ll fall into the\nintention-action gap.\nNow imagine your bank emails you and says, “Change your password by the\nend of the day.” In this case, you have a short, concrete deadline. To avoid\nmissing it, you’re likely to either change your password immediately or set aside\nspeci\u0000c time later in the day to do it. Either way, with the short deadline, you’re\nfar more likely to take action.\nResearchers have studied the e\u0000ects of the well-timed deadline—short while\nstill doable. Behavioral scientists Suzanne Shu and Ayelet Gneezy looked at how\noften people redeemed gift certi\u0000cates to a bakery. When the certi\u0000cate was good\nfor two months, fewer than 10 percent of people redeemed it for a pastry. (The\nrest were too \u0000aky!) But when the certi\u0000cate was good for only three weeks,\nsuddenly, more than 30 percent of people redeemed the coupon. In the \u0000rst\nscenario, people held o\u0000 on taking the action because they \u0000gured they could do\nit later. With the shorter deadline, people were more aware that they could miss\nthe window, so they took more immediate action.\nHesitaters, it’s time to set a deadline for when you’re going to start dating. I\nsuggest three weeks from now. That’s enough time to do what you need to do\n\f\n\u0000rst—the pre-dating work I’ve listed below—but not so long that you lose\nmomentum.\nStep 2: Prep.\nOnce you’ve set the deadline, start doing the pre-dating work. Download the\napps. Assemble a few solid date out\u0000ts. Consider going to an improv class to\nlearn how to listen carefully and play well with others. Pay attention the next\ntime you’re having dinner with a friend: How much are you focusing inward\n(How am I coming across?) versus really listening and being curious (What is this\nperson trying to communicate?)?\nAnd if you’ve been out of the dating game for a while: Take some \u0000attering\nphotos. I had a client who was terri\u0000ed of online dating. She’d always say, “I just\ndon’t have good photos for my pro\u0000le.” I convinced her to invest in beautiful\nnew headshots. Once she got the pictures back, she \u0000nally felt ready to start. She\ndownloaded the apps, received positive reinforcement about her pics, and went\non a date the next week. You certainly don’t need to splurge on professional\nphotography. Some \u0000attering lighting and a friend with a decent phone (oh, hey,\nportrait mode!) will do.\nAs part of your preparation, you may want to start seeing a therapist or\ncoach. What’s been holding you back? What are your unspoken fears? What in\nyour past is preventing you from moving forward? But going to therapy isn’t an\nexcuse to not start dating. It’s not a quick \u0000x. Don’t expect it to turn you into\nsome more perfect version of yourself in a few weeks, after which you’ll be\n“totally ready” to date. Commit to doing your therapy work in parallel with\ndating.\nStep 3: Tell others.\nIf you publicly announce your goals to others, you’re more likely to stay focused\non them. A team of researchers led by social psychologist Kevin McCaul\ndemonstrated this in a fascinating experiment. They took students who had a\nparticularly hard test coming up and divided them into di\u0000erent groups. They\nasked one set of students to share their target test score with their group. They\n\f\ninstructed a di\u0000erent group of students to keep their goal private. They found\nthose who had shared with others felt more committed to the goal, spent more\ntime studying for the test, and were 20 percent more likely to reach their goal\nand earn their target score.\nTell two to three of your closest friends or family members that you’re going\nto start dating. Share your deadline with them. You’ll feel more motivated to act\nonce you’ve made this public pronouncement because now your reputation is\non the line. (Bonus bene\u0000t: Sharing your dating goals with your community\nopens the door for people to set you up on dates. In Chapter 9, you’ll \u0000nd\npractical tips on asking to be set up.)\nStep 4: Commit to your new identity.\nWe all have di\u0000erent identities: daughter, friend, Beyoncé fan, runner, and so on.\nWe act di\u0000erently depending on which of those identities we lean into at any\ngiven moment. A group of Stanford and Harvard researchers found that we can\nactually shift people’s behavior simply by reinforcing one of those identities.\nThey surveyed registered voters the week of an election. They asked one group:\n“How important is it to you to vote?” For the other, demographically identical\ngroup, they phrased the question slightly di\u0000erently: “How important is it to\nyou to be a voter in the upcoming election?” They later analyzed voting records\nto see who had actually shown up at the polls. They found the people who had\nbeen asked about being a voter were 11 percent more likely to have voted than\nthose who were simply asked about the act of voting.\nWhile people in both groups may have intended to vote, the people who were\nnudged to think of themselves as voters were more likely to follow through on\ntheir plan. They considered themselves voters, not just people who vote. Once\nthat identity was reinforced, they were more likely to show up and vote.\nYou can use this lever to motivate yourself to start dating. Reinforce your\nown identity as a dater, not just someone who goes on dates. Stand in front of a\nmirror and say out loud: “I am looking for love. I am a dater.” Does this seem\nridiculous, especially before you’ve been on a date? Of course! But you should\ndo it anyway.\n\f\nI once worked with a client named Jacob who described himself on our \u0000rst\ncall as “very fat.” He told me, “My mom is fat, my dad is fat, we’re all fat.”\nHe worked at a nonpro\u0000t on their learning and development team. He\nwelcomed new employees to the company and trained them during their \u0000rst\nweek on the job. “I meet new people all the time. That’s not the problem. I just\nhate the idea of dating because I can’t imagine getting naked in front of anyone.\nSo what’s the point?”\nJacob said in the past he would try to lose weight, but then he’d fall o\u0000 the\nwagon and end up right back where he started—unhappy with his weight and\nstill single. Every week I tried to help Jacob see himself as a dater, not someone\nwho would start dating once he lost weight. He did the mirror exercise. He hated\nit, but he did it.\nOne day, instead of our normal session, and perhaps inspired by a recent\nQueer Eye marathon, I took Jacob shopping. It was time to show his body some\nlove.\nHe walked out of the dressing room and said, “Wow, I almost look good.”\nI laughed. With the help of a trendy teenage sales associate, we learned that\nhe’d been buying his clothes two sizes too big. He bought some \u0000attering new\njeans, jackets, and shirts.\nOver the months that followed, we found ways to improve his self-esteem by\nfocusing on his best qualities—like his beautiful eyes and wicked sense of humor\n—instead of waiting for a new body that might never come.\nWith time, his identity as a dater grew stronger. He continued to do the\nmirror exercise and started to hate it a little bit less. He downloaded a dating app\nand tried to go on at least one date a week. One weekend, he reconnected with\nan old friend from college who was visiting San Francisco from Denver. When\nthey went for a walk, he told her stories about his dating adventures. For the \u0000rst\ntime, she saw him as a potential romantic interest.\nDuring her next trip to San Francisco, they went on a date. And then\nanother. He visited her in Denver. And she came back to San Francisco. Fast-\nforward one year: He had just relocated to Denver to be with her. The last time\nwe spoke, he was elated. He \u0000nally had the one thing he never thought he’d \u0000nd:\na happy, healthy relationship.\n\f\nHe didn’t lose weight; he lost a limiting identity. He saw himself as an active\ndater, not a future one. The trick was changing how he saw himself.\nStart thinking of yourself as a dater, and the world will see you that way, too.\nStep 5: Start small.\nYou’re not the Beatles—you don’t have to go on eight dates a week. (Get it? Like\nthe song “Eight Days a Week”? Forgive me my dad jokes.) Psychologists Edwin\nLocke and Gary Latham found that setting speci\u0000c goals not only makes you\nmore likely to achieve your goals, it also leads to greater motivation, con\u0000dence,\nand self-e\u0000cacy.\nIn general, I recommend that clients go on at least one date a week. You\nshould proactively save time in your schedule for dates. One of my clients has a\ngoal of going on a date every Wednesday after work. It’s consistent, breaks up the\nweek, and gives her something to look forward to. Plus, if the date goes well, she\ncan meet up with them again that weekend.\nStep 6: Be compassionate with yourself.\nLook, I know this is hard. You’re putting yourself out there, perhaps for the \u0000rst\ntime. It’s scary. You might get hurt. Or hurt someone else.\nWhen a date doesn’t turn out how you hoped it would, talk to yourself the\nway you’d speak to your best friend. Imagine that friend called you and said,\n“What’s the point? This will never work. I’m just not good enough.”\nHow would you respond? You wouldn’t pile on the negativity, right? You’d\ntry to give a pep talk: “Come on. It’s just one date. Good for you for getting out\nthere. I bet you learned something, even if the date sucked.”\nLearn to be your own cheerleader. Learn to use that compassionate tone with\nyourself.\nThis was the key for Shea, our Hesitater from the beginning of the chapter.\nThrough our work together, and his weekly sessions with a therapist, he learned\nto accept himself for who he is now instead of focusing on the person he hopes\nto be in the future. He’s currently single and dating. (And if you know anyone\nspecial who might like a tall, thoughtful amateur guitar player, let me know!)\n\f\nNow it’s your turn. Start today. If not now, when?\nEXERCISE: Complete the Getting Ready Checklist\nI will start dating in earnest on the following date:_________ \n_\nI’ve downloaded at least one dating app\nI have at least ﬁve photos I could use for my proﬁle\nI have two outﬁts I could wear on a date\nI’ve told at least two friends that I am starting to date\nI’ve stood in front of the mirror and said, “I’m looking for love.\nI’m a dater” (or at the very least, “I think of myself as a dater!”)\nI’m committed to going on at least one date per week\nI’m practicing talking to myself compassionately—the way I’d\nspeak to a small child or best friend\nIf I hit a roadblock and lose momentum, I commit to trying\nagain instead of indulging my Hesitater ways.\nSTOP TALKING TO YOUR EX\nOne last thing—I’ve found that many of my Hesitater clients struggle to commit\nto dating in earnest because they’re hung up on an ex. But this advice holds true\nfor all daters: Stop talking to your ex.\nWe can think of keeping in touch with an ex (in a romantic or potentially\nromantic way) as keeping a door open.

    "raw_text": "mind about the relationship. That instinct, like so many others explored in this\nbook, is wrong. Keeping our ex around makes it harder, not easier, to move on.\nResearch bears this out. As part of an experiment, Harvard psychologists\nDaniel Gilbert and Jane Ebert created several two-day photography workshops\nfor students. Students shot photos around campus and developed their \u0000lm with\nthe help of an instructor. At the end of the workshop, the instructor told the\nstudents they could choose one of their developed photos for a special art\nexhibition in London. One group of students were told they had to choose a\nphoto to send that day and couldn’t change their minds later. Another group\nwas told to choose a picture now, but that someone would phone in the next few\ndays to see if they wanted to change their selection.\nWhen the instructors asked students in the second group if they wanted to\nchange their photos, very few of them did. But when the researchers surveyed\nthe students, the group that couldn’t change their minds about their pictures\nwas much more satis\u0000ed than the group that could. Why would those students\nbe any less satis\u0000ed, especially since most of them stuck to their original\nselections?\nWhile we instinctively prefer reversible decisions to irreversible ones, this\n\u0000exibility often make us less happy in the long run. We’d rather be able to change\nour minds—return our new phone, switch our \u0000ight to a di\u0000erent day, reply\n“maybe” to an event. But it turns out, just like the students who could switch\ntheir pictures, we’re less committed to choices we think we can reverse, and\ncommitment is crucial for happiness.\nAs we discussed earlier, once you commit to something, your brain starts the\nmagical process of rationalization, convincing you that you made a good choice.\nYou retroactively ascribe more positive traits to things you chose and more\nnegative traits to things you didn’t. The students who had to choose a \u0000nal\nphoto committed to their picture right away, immediately launching the\nrationalization process. Those who had the chance to change their selection\nspent the week going back and forth, weighing the di\u0000erent options. This led to\nfeelings of doubt, so that even when they stuck with their original photo, they\nfelt less sure about it. When your brain accepts something and you move on, you\naren’t left agonizing over the decision.\n\f\nIn other words, we want reversible decisions, but irrevocable ones make us\nhappier in the long term. Keeping your ex around as a potential love interest\nturns your breakup into a changeable decision. Allow yourself to move on by\nmaking it an unchangeable one.\nSo, did you slide into your ex’s DMs last night? If you’re still carrying a torch\nfor them and secretly wondering if you’ll get back together, try these Seven\nSimple Steps to Block ’Em Like It’s Hot:\n1. Take a deep breath.\n2. Grab your phone.\n3. Delete their number.\n4. Block them. Block them on everything. Social media, email, your bed, etc.\nIf their mom or sister follows you, block them, too. (It might seem harsh,\nbut you’re protecting your future self against mom postings of your ex\nwith a new boo under the mistletoe.)\n5. Actually delete their number this time. I know you have it saved elsewhere.\nI’ll wait.\n6. Burn your phone. (Just kidding, but you honestly might want to limit\nyour screen time during this initial separation phase.)\n7. Oh, and don’t forget the payment app Venmo. Seeing your ex send Venmo\nmoney to some new \u0000ing for—Oh, God, is that an eggplant emoji?!?!\nTHEY NEVER SENT ME AN EGGPLANT EMOJI!—is doing nothing\nfor your emotional wellness.\nMaybe this seems like too much. How harmful could it be to check their\nInstagram or Facebook once in a while? Here’s even more evidence from\npsychologists Tara Marshall and Ashley Mason. In one research paper, Marshall\nwrote that “exposure to an ex-partner through Facebook may obstruct the\nprocess of healing.” Mason found that talking to an ex worsens your\npsychological health. And for goodness’ sake, don’t sleep with your ex! Mason\nalso discovered that “having SWE (sex with ex)” makes it harder to move on. In\nother words, creeping on (or sleeping with) an ex only slows down the process of\ngetting over them.\n\f\nSo do yourself a favor and shut that door. Stop talking to your ex! Make your\nchangeable decision unchangeable.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Hesitaters delay dating because they don’t feel 100 percent\nready yet and want to put their best foot forward. But no one\never feels 100 percent ready for anything. At a certain point,\nyou just have to start.\n2. Perfection is a lie. Everyone else is imperfect, too—even the\nperson you’ll eventually end up with.\n3. By waiting to date, Hesitaters miss out on a chance to\ndevelop their dating skills and ﬁgure out what type of person\nthey want to be with.\n4. Here’s how you can learn to overcome your hesitation:\nSet deadlines for yourself.\nDo prep work for your new dating life.\nTell others about your plan.\nCommit to your new identity as a “dater.”\nStart with small goals.\nBe compassionate with yourself.\nSTOP TALKING TO YOUR EX!"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 6\nLEARN YOUR ATTACHMENT STYLE\nHow to Manage Your Attachment Style\nI met Vivian at a barre workout class. She was always the \u0000rst one there, doing\nenthusiastic butt clenches and micro squats before class even started. I also like\nto arrive early to workout classes, mainly to alleviate my anxiety about getting a\ngood spot. Week after week, we’d see each other, both of us clearly trying not to\nlook annoyed when our teacher arrived late.\nOne of those mornings, we started talking, and I learned how much we had\nin common. We shared several close friends from the East Coast. We’d moved to\nSan Francisco the same year. We also loved the same neighborhood café, which\nwe began visiting together after class.\nIt was in that café where she confessed: “All of the guys I like don’t like me\nback, but all of the guys who like me, I think are boring.” As we waited in line to\norder, she glanced around and whispered, “What am I supposed to do? Am I\ngoing to have to settle?”\nVivian didn’t like to think of herself as someone who settled. She worked in\ncorporate PR at a large company, handling what’s known as “crisis comms.”\nThat year and the years before it, the crises had been relentless. She was expected\nto be battle-ready at all times, prepared for any lawsuit or hit piece. She exercised\n\u0000ve times a week, ate a strictly vegan diet, and had just obtained her sailing\nlicense. The woman was in control of everything. Everything but her dating life.\nVivian knew I worked as a dating coach and matchmaker. She had shared a\nlittle bit about her dating life in our previous conversations, but this was the \u0000rst\ntime she had really opened up.\n“So, let’s take a step back. What’s your dating history like?” I asked her.\n\f\n“In a word: disappointing,” she said. “I had a thing with this guy for two\nyears. I don’t even know if I should really call it a thing. He sure wouldn’t. He\nlived in my apartment building in New York, and we’d hook up whenever he felt\nlike it. Then there was this guy at work when I \u0000rst moved here, but he sent a lot\nof mixed messages, and it sort of \u0000zzled. Lately, I’ve been on the dating apps, and\nI’ve been on what feels like a million dates, but as soon as someone says they like\nme, I immediately lose interest. Tell me the truth. Am I cursed? Am I going to\ndie alone?”\nI laughed. “No, you’re great. You’re beautiful and interesting, and you know\nhow to sail a friggin’ boat. I just think you might be looking for the wrong\nthings.” I was trying to stay on my side of the mat but felt myself slowly veering\ninto coaching mode. I wanted to help.\n“The wrong things? I didn’t say anything about going after tall guys or rich\nguys.”\n“That’s not what I mean,” I said, interrupting her. “Have you ever heard of\nattachment theory?”\nATTACHMENT 101\nOf all the relationship science insights I share with my clients, attachment theory\nis one of the most powerful. It’s a popular framework that helps explain why\nwe’re attracted to certain types of people, why past relationships haven’t worked\nout, and why we’re plagued by certain bad habits.\nYou can read entire books on the topic, including Attached, by Amir Levine\nand Rachel Heller, and Hold Me Tight, by Sue Johnson, but attachment theory\nhas made such a di\u0000erence to my friends, my clients, and my own life that I\nwanted to include it here, too. I’ve worked with people who struggled with\ndating for years, learned about this framework, and used it to completely shift\ntheir approach. It’s not easy, but the results can be powerful. I know more than a\nhandful of people who owe their marital success to what they learned from\nattachment theory. (Clearly, I’m very attached to this theory.)\nAfter ordering our drinks, Vivian and I sat in a cushion-\u0000lled nook at the\nback of the café. I began to explain what attachment theory is and why it\n\f\nmatters.\nIt all dates back to the work of developmental psychologist John Bowlby. He\nbelieved that children have an innate attachment to their mothers. Later,\npsychologist Mary Ainsworth investigated how attachment might vary between\nchildren in a now-famous experiment called “The Strange Situation.” She\ninvited mothers and babies (between twelve and eighteen months old) into her\nlab and observed them in a series of di\u0000erent scenarios.\nFirst the mother and baby entered a room \u0000lled with toys. The baby felt safe\nto play and explore because the mother functioned as the secure base—someone\nwho could provide help if they needed it. Then the lab assistant instructed the\nmother to leave the room, and observed how the baby responded to both the\nmother’s absence and her return a few minutes later. The experiment explored a\nbaby’s ability to trust that their needs would be met, even with the temporary\nabsence of their secure base.\nSome babies showed signs of distress as soon as their mother left. When she\nreturned, these babies would be temporarily soothed and stop crying but then\nangrily push the mother away and begin crying again. Ainsworth called these\nbabies “anxiously attached.”\nAnother group of babies cried when their mother left but stopped as soon as\nshe returned. They quickly resumed playing. These were the “securely\nattached” babies.\nA third group did not respond to their mother leaving the room; nor did they\nacknowledge her when she returned. They pretended they weren’t bothered by\nthe situation, but the researchers could tell from their elevated heart rate and\nstress levels that these babies were just as upset as the ones who cried. These were\nthe “avoidantly attached” babies.\nAinsworth and her team concluded that we all have the same need for\nattachment and attention, but we develop di\u0000erent coping strategies to deal\nwith our particular caregivers.\nYears later, researchers found the same theory applies to our adult attachment\nstyle—whom we’re attracted to, how we relate to them, and why many of our\nrelationships succeed or fail. But don’t blame your mom for your relationship\n\f\nissues just yet. Our relationship with our parents is one of only a number of\nfactors that determine our adult attachment style.\n“Which one am I?” Vivian said.\n“Well,” I said, “those anxiously attached babies who cried when their mothers\nleft the room and continued to cry when the mother returned? As babies, they\nworried their needs would go unmet, and lashed out with anger and frustration.\nAs adults, they’re afraid of abandonment and want to be in constant contact\nwith their partners.”\n“That is so me.”\nI smiled at Vivian because she had sent me seven rapid-\u0000re texts in a row\nwhen I hadn’t shown up to class the week before.\nWhen people are anxiously attached, their brains \u0000ood with “activating\nstrategies,” thoughts that compel them to regain closeness. For example, they\nmight think about their partner nonstop. Or they may dwell on their partner’s\ngood qualities while undervaluing their own. This distortion leads to panic. And\nwhen they don’t hear back from their partners immediately, they worry they’re\nbeing abandoned. They can shake their anxiety only when they’re actively\ncommunicating with their partner. This also leads them to jump into\nrelationships and stay in them past their expiration date because they fear being\nalone and worry that this is their only shot at love.\n“Anxiously attached folks,” I said, “and I’m not pointing any \u0000ngers here,\nalso engage in ‘protest behavior.’ ”\nPeople with anxious-attachment styles often act out in order to get their\npartner’s attention. They might call or text an excessive number of times,\nthreaten to leave to make the other person jealous, or withdraw and ignore\nphone calls to underscore a point.\nAnd what about the avoidantly attached babies who acted uninterested when\ntheir moms returned to the room, even though they were upset? They felt like\nthey couldn’t rely on their caregiver, who met only some of their needs. They\ndevelop into avoidantly attached adults: They try to minimize the pain of\nrejection by pretending they don’t actually want to connect. They don’t believe\nthey can rely on others to meet their emotional needs, so they avoid getting too\nclose to anyone. When intimacy increases, they try to pull away. Those attempts\n\f\nto disengage are called “deactivating strategies.” If you’ve heard someone say,\n“I’m not ready to commit” or “I just need space” or “My job is really demanding\nso I can’t see you right now,” then you’ve experienced avoidantly attached\nbehavior.\nPeople with this attachment style also tend to dwell on their partner’s\nimperfections and use those as an excuse to exit the relationship and regain\nindependence. They fantasize about how much happier they’d be if they were\nsingle or with someone else.\nWhen I outlined the avoidant-attachment style, Vivian nodded. “That\nsounds exactly like everyone I’ve ever dated,” she said.\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself,” I told her. This pattern is actually extremely\ncommon. It’s called the “anxious-avoidant loop.” Anxiously attached people\nexpect that the person they love will pull back and they in turn will need to chase\nthem. It’s what happened with Vivian’s ex who lived in her apartment building.\n“It was so exciting,” Vivian said. “I’d wonder: Will he call me back? Can I see\nhim this weekend?” That possibility of rejection created anxiety, a feeling Vivian\nconfused for butter\u0000ies. And when the guy started pulling away, she felt it even\nmore intensely.\nThe avoidantly attached guy, meanwhile, was probably experiencing\nsomething else entirely. People with this attachment style fear losing their\nindependence. So when Vivian started pulling closer, it likely reinforced his\nunhealthy view of relationships—and made him want to withdraw even further.\n“If you think about it this way,” I said, “the anxious-avoidant loop makes\nsense. Avoidantly attached people are so good at pushing other people away, the\nonly time they end up in a relationship is when the other person is especially\npersistent.”\n“I am nothing if not persistent,” Vivian said.\nThe server \u0000nally arrived with our drinks. Vivian looked out the window,\nwatching a couple on the bench outside the café. “What about that last group of\nbabies, who stopped crying when their mom returned?” she asked.\n“Those are the securely attached babies, who felt con\u0000dent their mothers\nwould meet their needs. People with a secure attachment style make ideal\npartners. They’re reliable and trustworthy. They tend to avoid drama and, if not,\n\f\nare able to defuse it when they see it coming. They’re \u0000exible, forgiving, and\ngood at communicating. They behave consistently. They create healthy\nboundaries. They’re comfortable with intimacy. People with secure-attachment\nstyles end up reporting higher levels of relationship satisfaction than avoidant or\nanxious folks.”\n“I have literally never dated anyone like that,” Vivian responded. “Are secure\npeople, like, one percent of the population?”\nIn reality, 50 percent of the population is secure, 20 percent is anxiously\nattached, 25 percent is avoidantly attached, and the remainder fall into a group\ncalled anxious-avoidant. That might seem like good news. The problem is that\nwhile securely attached people make up 50 percent of the general population,\nthere are far fewer in the single population. That’s because secure people tend to\nget snatched up quickly. They’re good at building healthy relationships, so they\ntend to stay in them. That’s why the dating pool is full of anxious and avoidant\ndaters.\nWhen I explained all of that to Vivian, she sighed. “I give up,” she said,\nsipping the last of her smoothie.\nShe said that, but she didn’t."

    "raw_text": "EXERCISE: Determine Your Style\nIf you’re curious about your own attachment style, answer\nthese questions:\n1. How comfortable are you with intimacy and closeness?\nHow much do you tend to avoid intimacy?\n2. How anxious do you feel about your partner’s love and\ninterest in you? Do you constantly worry about the\nrelationship?\nYou may be anxiously attached if you crave closeness but\nare insecure about your relationship’s future and your\npartner’s interest in you. You may be avoidantly attached if\nyou feel uncomfortable when things get too close, and you\nvalue freedom over connection. You may be secure if you\nare comfortable with intimacy, spending time alone, and\ndon’t often worry about the relationship.\nYou can take the online quiz linked from my website,\nloganury.com, to conﬁrm your attachment style.\nLOOK FOR A SECURE PARTNER\nDespite what Vivian had said about giving up, in the months following our\nconversation, she made an e\u0000ort to approaching dating di\u0000erently. She started\nlooking for secure partners. It took time. She’d go out with someone new and\ncomplain that they were “boring.” When I dug deeper, I discovered this usually\nmeant the person was being nice to her. For example, she told a guy with whom\nshe’d been on two dates that she was visiting Seattle the next weekend. He then\nsent her a list of restaurant recommendations. When she told me that story, she\nended by saying: “And that’s why I never want to see him again.”\n“Wait, what?” I said.\n\f\n“He clearly likes me way too much. It’s pathetic.”\nI did my best to help her see the situation di\u0000erently. This guy was trying to\nbe helpful because he liked her. It was a secure act and not a pathetic one. We\nworked on helping her break that anxious-avoidant loop.\nIf you relate to Vivian’s story, and believe that you’re anxiously attached,\nthat’s your homework, too. Now, I’m not suggesting that everyone you \u0000nd\nboring is secretly secure. They might actually be boring. But it’s time to stop\npursuing the chase. That was the challenge I gave Vivian: Try to date secure\npartners. The ones who text when they say they will. Who let you know what’s\non their mind. Who don’t play games and avoid or even de-escalate drama.\nThe same goes for you, my avoidantly attached readers. Find yourself a secure\npartner!\nLEARN TO SELF-REGULATE\nAt the same time, you can work to become more secure yourself. Attachment\nstyles are relatively stable over your lifetime, although about a quarter of people\nchange their attachment style over a four-year period. It takes e\u0000ort, but you can\nshift your attachment style.\nVivian was determined to make a change, which for her meant learning to\nself-regulate—managing disruptive impulses and emotions. She trained herself\nnot to panic when she didn’t immediately hear back from someone. In those\nmoments, she practiced quieting her anxieties by either taking a walk or calling a\nfriend. (Both healthier options than sending fourteen texts to the guy she’d met\nin the elevator at work the day before.)\nAnd for those of you who are avoidantly attached, pay attention to your\nfeelings when you sense yourself withdrawing. Learn to ask for space instead of\ndisappearing into space. Or when you sense yourself focusing on your partner’s\nshortcomings and wanting to leave because of them, try a di\u0000erent technique:\nPractice looking for the positive qualities instead. Remember that no one is\nperfect, and if you leave, the next person you meet won’t be perfect, either.\nChanging your attachment style on your own can be challenging. There are\nso many unconscious reasons we are the way we are, and mining the past may\n\f\nbring up unexpected and di\u0000cult questions. How does our relationship with\nour mom relate to our attachment style? If we \u0000nd a healthier attachment now,\ndoes that mean we’re betraying or abandoning her? You may have to face that\nyou didn’t get what you needed from the person you most needed it from. Many\npeople \u0000nd it helpful to talk through these issues with a therapist.\nVivian and I continued to discuss her love life after each class. Soon she\nstopped calling guys “boring” when they began to express interest in her. She\nproudly texted me when she told a clearly avoidant suitor to buzz o\u0000. And guess\nwhat? After about six months, she met a great-looking guy who had just\nrelocated to San Francisco from Houston. After their \u0000rst date, on a Friday\nnight, he called her and said, “I really like you, and I want to see you again\ntomorrow.” Instead of deeming that “pathetic,” she found herself at breakfast\nwith him the very next day, just as he’d asked. Breakfast turned into a walk. The\nwalk turned into meeting up with her friends at a brewery. The brewery turned\ninto a drunken cab ride back to his house, followed by a long nap. Two years\nlater, they’re still napping together.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Attachment theory is a popular framework for understanding\nrelationships. It can help explain why you’re attracted to\ncertain people, why past relationships haven’t worked out,\nand why you’re trapped in a pattern of bad habits.\n2. You may be anxiously attached if you crave a lot of\ncloseness but are insecure about your relationship’s future\nand your partner’s interest in you. You may be avoidantly\nattached if you feel uncomfortable with intimacy and value\nindependence over connection. You may be securely\nattached if you are comfortable with intimacy, spending time\nalone, and drawing clear boundaries.\n3. Securely attached folks make up 50 percent of the\npopulation but not the dating pool, since they tend to get into\nrelationships and stay in them. Anxiously attached and\navoidantly attached people often date each other, reinforcing\ntheir worst tendencies.\n4. If you’re anxiously attached or avoidantly attached, you can\nhelp yourself develop better relationship skills by looking for\na secure partner and learning to self-regulate—managing\ndisruptive impulses and emotions.\n\f\nCHAPTER 7\nLOOK FOR A LIFE PARTNER, NOT A\nPROM DATE\nHow to Focus on What Matters in a Long-Term Partner\nBrian looked like Keanu Reeves’s more attractive brother.\nWe met at Burning Man, the annual art and psychedelics festival in the\nNevada desert. That \u0000rst night, dressed head to toe in white linen, dust goggles\ndraped around his neck, he whispered, “Can I kiss you?” I nodded, adjusting the\ncream-colored fur hat I’d paired with a spotted onesie to complete my snow\nleopard look. We kissed as Paul Oakenfold DJed. Thousands of Burners danced\naround us. When the beat dropped, the crowd cheered, and we kissed harder.\nLater, a stranger in a wizard’s robe handed us a Polaroid capturing our\nembrace. “You just looked so in love.” And I was sure we were. I was swept up in\nthe romance of falling for him while exploring this otherworldly desert\nmoonscape.\nI was still interested in Brian when we returned to San Francisco. One\nafternoon we sat on a bench at Google headquarters, where we both worked,\nand traded stories about our “decompression”—the experience of adjusting back\nto real life after Burning Man. Brian had swapped his linen for jeans and a T-\nshirt.\nWe swiped some beers from a microkitchen and hopped on the Google\nshuttle back to San Francisco. I grinned as I slid onto the seat next to him. We\nshared headphones. Left earbud in his ear, right earbud in mine, he played “The\nTrapeze Swinger” by Iron and Wine. I closed my eyes and remembered our\n\f\ndeliriously happy moment dancing in the desert. This is what love feels like, I\nthought.\nBrian was hot, spontaneous, and fun. But also unreliable. I never knew if he’d\ntext me back or come over when he said he would. He knew how much I liked\nhim. He’d act interested one day and aloof the next. I never asked myself\nquestions like this: Is he kind and thoughtful? Do I trust his judgment? Would he\nremember to take our kids to the dentist? (If his own dentist-going habits were any\nindication, no, he would not.)\nLooking back, I wonder why I, someone who wanted to \u0000nd a serious partner\nand create a long-term relationship, desperately tried to convince him to date\nme. Why did I keep falling for guys like Brian? My choices weren’t helping me\ncreate the relationship I wanted. Instead of dating for long-term partnership, I\nwas optimizing for short-term fun.\nTHE PROM DATE VERSUS THE LIFE PARTNER\nMany of us struggle to make good choices for our future selves—and not just\nwhen it comes to dating. We’re guilty of this when we procrastinate on\nhousehold chores (although we know we have to do them eventually), when we\ndon’t exercise (although we know it’s important for long-term health), and\nwhen we spend money frivolously (although we know we should save it). These\nare all moments when we fall prey to the present bias, an error in judgment that\ncauses us to place a disproportionately high value on the here and now and an\ninappropriately low value on the future.\nMany of us don’t date for long-term viability. I certainly didn’t when chasing\nBrian. I call this pursuing the Prom Date. What’s an ideal prom date? Someone\nwho looks great in pictures, gives you a night full of fun, and makes you look\ncool in front of your friends. Many of us \u0000nished high school more than a\ndecade ago, and yet we’re still using the same rubric to evaluate potential\npartners. Do you really want to marry the Prom Date? To worry if your partner\nis going to help you take care of your aging parents? Or show up to your kid’s\nparent-teacher conference? Or nurse you back to health after contracting a case\nof Montezuma’s revenge?"

    "raw_text": "Those probably aren’t the questions you ask yourself when you \u0000rst meet\nsomeone. The answers have little bearing on whether you want to kiss the person\nor go out with them again. (And who wants to think about diarrhea on a \u0000rst\ndate!?) But when you’re looking for a long-term partner, you want someone\nwho will be there for you during the highs and the lows. Someone you can rely\non. Someone to make decisions with. The Life Partner.\nI’m lucky to count the brilliant couples therapist Esther Perel as a mentor.\nShe once explained to me the di\u0000erence between a love story and a life story.\nThere are many people with whom you can share a tryst but far fewer with\nwhom you can build a life. When you’re thinking about who to marry, she says,\ndon’t ask yourself: What would a love story with this person look like? Instead,\nask: Can I make a life with this person? That’s the fundamental distinction.\nMost of us start developing crushes on the Prom Date around the time we go\nthrough puberty. And it makes sense! When you’re a teen, you’re thinking about\nwhom you want to smooch, not who will make a good coparent.\nBut you’re not \u0000fteen anymore. If you really are seeking a long-term\nrelationship with a committed partner, you need to stop looking for a Prom\nDate and start seeking a Life Partner.\nWHEN TO DITCH THE PROM DATE\nWhen should you make this shift? There isn’t one answer for everyone, but in a\nconversation I had with behavioral economist Dan Ariely, we came up with a\nhelpful rule of thumb for those of you who want to have children: You should\ndeliberately change the way you evaluate potential partners around six to eight\nyears before you want to have kids. Now, that’s not a scienti\u0000c number but,\nrather, a framework for thinking through when to make this shift.\nI imagine many of you—like many of my clients—are already in that critical\nwindow. I don’t mean to make you feel behind. I just want to encourage you to\ntake yourself seriously and start dating someone who has the potential to be a\nserious partner.\nBe honest with yourself. Do you tend to date Prom Dates or Life Partners? A\nclient once told me she’d gone on several dates with a guy who lived alone. When\n\f\nshe visited his apartment and used the bathroom, she was met with a sink full of\nbeard hair trimmings, an over\u0000owing trash can, and no toilet paper. This\nwoman is a successful, talented professional. She’s thirty-four, and she told me\nshe wants to have “many kids.” I’m not saying that a guy with a \u0000lthy bathroom\ncouldn’t make a great husband and father. But if she’s thirty-four and wants to\ngive birth to a brood of children, she realistically needs to start soon. And who’s\nmore likely to be ready to start a family—a guy with a clean bathroom or a man\nwho still acts like he lives in a dorm? I advised her to say goodbye to this Prom\nDate and focus her energy on \u0000nding a Life Partner.\nTo shift toward pursuing the Life Partner, you must learn to recognize the\npresent bias and deliberately work against it.\nWHAT WE GET WRONG ABOUT WHAT MATTERS\nIn addition to coaching, I also work as a matchmaker and set my clients up on\ndates. I started this work when I learned how many of my friends and clients\nwere struggling on the apps. As a matchmaker, I’ve met with dozens of people to\nlearn what they’re looking for in a partner. Hundreds have \u0000lled out the\nmatchmaking form on my website to join “Logan’s List.” Through this process,\nI’ve collected enough data to understand what people think matters most in a\nserious partner. We can compare that to what the academic \u0000eld of relationship\nscience tells us actually matters for long-term relationship success.\nWe can thank John Gottman for many of these relationship science insights.\nHe spent more than four decades studying romantic relationships. For years, he\nand his colleague Robert Levenson brought couples into an observational\nresearch laboratory dubbed the “Love Lab” by the media. There, he recorded\nthem discussing their relationship. He asked couples to share the story of how\nthey met and then recount a recent \u0000ght. He even invited couples to spend a\nweekend in an apartment he’d decked out with cameras to observe how they\ninteracted during everyday moments.\nYears after they participated in the apartment study, Gottman followed up\nwith the couples to check on their relationships. They fell into two camps: the\n“masters,” couples who were still happily married; and the “disasters,” couples\n\f\nwho had either broken up or remained together unhappily. He studied the\noriginal tapes of these two types of couples to learn what patterns separated the\nmasters from the disasters.\nWhen we look at Gottman’s \u0000ndings, and the work of other relationship\nscientists, we can see clearly which qualities contribute to long-term relationship\nsuccess. In other words, the research tells us what makes a good Life Partner.\nHowever, these are not the traits my matchmaking clients tend to ask for.\nInstead, they focus on short-term desirability—or the characteristics of a good\nProm Date.\nWHAT MATTERS LESS THAN WE THINK\nNot only do we undervalue the qualities that matter for long-term relationships,\nwe overvalue irrelevant ones. In part, we can blame a cognitive error called the\nfocusing illusion—our tendency to overestimate the importance of certain\nfactors when anticipating outcomes, like our future happiness.\nBehavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and David Schkade explored this\nphenomenon. They asked people attending college in Michigan and Ohio who\nthey thought were happier—Midwestern students, like themselves, or students\nin California. They asked students in Southern California the same questions.\nBoth groups predicted that the California students were happier. Yet\nresearchers found the overall life satisfaction for Californian and Midwestern\nstudents was nearly identical.\nIt turned out that both sets of students overestimated the impact that living\nin a warmer climate has on daily satisfaction. That’s because the climate is an\n“easily observable and distinctive” di\u0000erence between these two places. They\nignored all the other factors that contribute to happiness, which both sets of\nstudents shared: concerns about grades, social status, family issues, money, career\nprospects, and more. Those things are the same no matter the weather.\nHowever, when asked to compare life in those two places, the students focused\non the weather and assumed it had a greater impact than it really does.\nKahneman summarized this research \u0000nding perfectly: “Nothing in life is as\nimportant as you think it is while you are thinking about it.” Merely thinking\n\f\nabout something accentuates the di\u0000erences.\nWe’re guilty of falling victim to the focusing illusion when selecting potential\nmates. The people I coach often list requirements such as “I need someone who\nloves to dance.” In that moment, they’re focusing on the fact that they\nthemselves love to dance. Then, because of the focusing illusion, just thinking\nabout it causes them to overestimate its importance. The truth is, even if they’re\nnotorious for sweating through their shirt on salsa night, they likely don’t spend\nmore than a few hours a month on the dance \u0000oor. But people tend to \u0000xate on\nthese insigni\u0000cant characteristics and ignore the far more important factors that\nare correlated with long-term relationship happiness (more on those in a\nmoment).\nThe same is true of looks, money, and more. These things make a di\u0000erence,\njust much less than we tend to think.\n1) Money\nDon’t get me wrong, money matters. When couples below the poverty line\nstruggle to meet their basic needs, their marriage su\u0000ers. Texas Tech University\npsychologists studied married couples in therapy and found that low-income\ncouples were far more dissatis\u0000ed with their relationship than middle-income\ncouples. In fact, low-income couples felt about as unhappy as divorced couples\ndid in the month before they broke up.\nIt’s no secret that \u0000nancial woes cause marital stress. It’s one of the main\nreasons why couples divorce. If you have enough resources, you won’t constantly\nface the strain of hard \u0000nancial decisions, like having to choose between getting\nyour oldest child braces and sending your youngest to a math tutor. What’s\nmore, research from Harvard Business School found that couples who can\na\u0000ord to outsource time-intensive tasks like cooking and cleaning enjoy greater\nrelationship satisfaction because they can spend more quality time together.\nBut that doesn’t mean that in order to be happy, you should pursue the\nrichest partner you can. While it’s di\u0000cult to determine an exact threshold\nbeyond which more money will no longer buy you more happiness, research by\nbehavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton famously found"

    "raw_text": "that there is no increase in “emotional well-being” (economist-speak for\nhappiness) once salaries exceed $75,000 a year.\nIn fact, additional research suggests that the extent to which you can derive\nhappiness from money in the \u0000rst place depends on the wealth of those around\nyou. In other words, it’s not really the size of your house that matters. It’s the\nsize of your house in comparison to the size of your neighbors’ houses.\nThat’s because we acclimate to our conditions. We often forget about\nadaptation—the process of getting used to a situation. No matter how\nwonderful something is, the novelty eventually wears o\u0000, and we stop paying\nmuch attention to it. And once we stop paying attention to it, it doesn’t bring us\nthe same level of joy, or misery, that it did when we were focused on it. This\nexplains the results of a 1978 study led by psychologist Philip Brickman, in\nwhich he and his team surveyed lottery winners a year after their windfall.\nLottery winners, it turns out, are less happy in the long term than you’d think.\nThey’re about as happy as non–lottery winners, and actually have an even\nharder time enjoying the small pleasures in life than people who haven’t won\nanything. Lottery winners adapted to their environment, and their wealth had a\nmuch smaller than anticipated e\u0000ect on their overall life satisfaction.\nKey tip for your dating search\nWhen we make a decision, we tend to focus on the immediate\njoy or misery it will bring. But remember: We are bad fortune-\ntellers! We often can’t account for how those feelings will\nchange over time. Money matters, but only up to a certain\nextent. You’re not wrong for considering that element of your\nfuture relationship, but don’t prioritize wealth above all else.\n2) Good Looks\nIt’s no secret that looks make a di\u0000erence in many realms of life. Attractive\npeople tend to earn higher salaries and beat their less attractive opponents in\npolitical races. In multiple studies investigating attractiveness, researchers noted\nthat good-looking people are perceived as more persuasive, trustworthy,\n\f\noutgoing, socially competent and powerful, sexually responsive, healthy,\nintelligent, and likable.\nAnd when it comes to dating, there’s a historical and evolutionary reason for\nprizing good looks. Early on, life was a constant struggle for survival. Physically\nattractive traits—like clear skin or thick hair—indicated health and vitality. That\nwas important for mate selection because it meant that not only would this\nperson pass on these desirable quality traits to your kids, they’d also be more\nlikely to stay alive long enough to help raise them. No wonder our brains trained\nus to go for the hotties.\nIn today’s world, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine and\nindustrialized food production, we’re not plagued by the same issues. Our\no\u0000spring have a very good chance at surviving, so it no longer makes sense to\nprioritize reproductive \u0000tness—the ability to pass on genes to future generations\n—when choosing a partner. Your kid will be \u0000ne even if his dad had acne in his\nteens.\nWhat’s more, focusing on attractiveness to the exclusion of other traits\nignores the fact that lust inevitably fades over time (and remember, we’re going\nfor long-term success here). In his book The Science of Happily Ever After,\npsychologist Ty Tashiro analyzed a fourteen-year longitudinal study of\nsatisfaction in marriages over time. He found that over the course of seven years,\n“lust” (sexual desire) for a partner declined twice as fast as “liking” (friendship\ncharacterized by loyalty and kindness).\nBiological anthropologist Helen Fisher helps explain why that happens. Lust\nis incredibly intense in the beginning and then fades. When we fall in love, it\nfeels like we’re addicted to the other person, as if they’re a drug. Fisher found\nthat cocaine and falling in love light up the same regions of the brain.\nThe fading of our lust is also a strategic evolutionary move. Our “addiction”\nto our partner keeps us around long enough to have a baby and raise him or her\ntogether until the child is around four years old, old enough to be somewhat\nindependent (at least on the ancient savanna) and survive. Once our work there\nis done, lust fades, and our brain frees us to create new children with new\npartners, increasing the chance that at least one of our children will live to\nadulthood and carry on our DNA.\n\f\nIf you’re judging your relationship during a stage when you have sex all the\ntime, how well can you predict what the relationship will be like when that slows\ndown?\nAnd if it’s good sex you’re after, there’s no guarantee someone who is\nattractive will even be good in bed. There may be skills that beautiful people\nnever develop because they don’t need to. An episode of the TV show 30 Rock\ncalled “The Bubble” takes this idea to the extreme. Jon Hamm plays a character\nwho is insulated by his own handsomeness. He’s a former tennis pro who can’t\nserve, a doctor who doesn’t know the Heimlich maneuver, and as Tina Fey’s\ncharacter complains, “He’s as bad at sex as I am.” Her suave boss knows this\nphenomenon \u0000rsthand: “That is the danger of being super-handsome,” he tells\nher. “When you’re in the bubble, nobody ever tells you the truth.” So yeah,\ndon’t assume that the best-looking people make the best lovers.\nFinally, remember what we just learned about adaptation. Even if you marry\nthe most attractive person, eventually, you’ll get used to how they look. That\ninitial pleasure will fade. A big part of our sex drive is associated with novelty. So\nno matter how hot your partner is, it’s likely that your sexual interest in them\nwill decrease over time, simply because they are no longer new to you. To\nparaphrase some Internet wisdom: “For every hot person, there is someone out\nthere tired of having sex with them.”\nInfatuation fades! Lust fades! All that matters is that you feel attracted to the\nperson, not that you scored the hottest possible person.\nKey tip for your dating search\nPhysical attraction can obscure long-term compatibility. Pay\nattention to whether or not you’re attracted to someone and\nfocus less on how society would evaluate that person’s looks.\nDon’t prioritize lust over more important long-term factors.\n3) A Personality Similar to Yours\nMy clients often complain that they need to \u0000nd a partner with a personality\nsimilar to theirs. I hear: “I’m so extroverted and he’s so introverted. It would\n\f\nnever work.” Or: “I’m really neurotic and nothing ever seems to bother him.\nWe’re just not a match.”\nI’ve found this sentiment especially common among my older clients. When\nwe’re younger and we enter a relationship, it’s like a start-up—two people\ncoming together to build something. We’re more \u0000exible and still \u0000guring out\nwhat we want. When we’re older and thinking about long-term relationships\nand, eventually, marriage, the process is more like a merger: two complete beings\ncoming together. The older we get, the more set in our ways we are, and the\nmore we crave someone who will easily \u0000t into our lives. We assume that the\nmore similar we are, the easier the merger will be.\nBut that assumption is wrong. Research tells us that similar personalities are\nnot a predictor of long-term relationship success. In my interview with\nNorthwestern professor and marriage expert Eli Finkel, he said, “There is no\ncorrelation between how satis\u0000ed or how happy you are with a relationship and\nhow similar your personalities are.” In other words, we make our potential pool\nof partners smaller by mistakenly eliminating people who are not similar enough\nto us.\nThe question is: Would you really want to date yourself? I know I wouldn’t!\nA client of mine is the life of the party. He’s an event promoter with a big\npersonality. He was dating someone calm and caring who liked to be in bed\nbefore ten p.m. on most nights. He wondered, Wouldn’t my life be better if I\ndated someone more like me?\nI sat him down and told him that two of him would be too much for one\nroom, let alone one relationship! They’d \u0000ght to be the center of attention. “Do\nyou know the show The Amazing Race?” I asked him. The show follows couples\nor pairs of friends or family members who travel to exotic locations to complete\nmissions. “The pairs that are too similar \u0000ght,” I said. “They get stuck on the\nsame things. The most successful duos complement each other. They don’t have\nidentical traits. When they miss a \u0000ight, one partner \u0000nds another route and\nsoothes the other’s panic. That’s what makes them win. You want the same\nthing with your life partner.”\nOver the course of a year, he worked on appreciating his partner’s di\u0000erences\nrather than wishing she were more like him. They recently decided to have a"

    "raw_text": "baby together.\nKey tip for your dating search\nFind someone who complements you, not your personality\ntwin.\nGENETICS!\nMany people say they want to ﬁnd someone with a similar\npersonality. Yet when Michigan State University researchers\nWilliam Chopik and Richard Lucas studied more than twenty-ﬁve\nhundred married couples who had been together for an average of\ntwenty years, they found that couples with similar personalities\naren’t any more satisﬁed with their relationships.\nAnd when it comes to our genes, we may have evolved to prefer\npeople who are genetically dissimilar to us. There’s a theory that\nwe feel attracted to the smell of people who are genetically\ndiﬀerent from us because if we reproduced with them, we’d pass\non two very diﬀerent sets of genes—making our oﬀspring more\nrobust and more likely to survive.\nSwiss biological researcher Claus Wedekind explored this in\nhis famous T-shirt study. He collected DNA samples from male\nand female students. To capture their smell, he instructed male\nstudents to wear the same cotton T-shirt for two nights and to\navoid smell-producing activities like sex. Then he asked female\nstudents to smell six T-shirts—three from genetically similar\nmen and three from genetically dissimilar ones—and rate each\none based on intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness. He found\nwomen preferred the smell of the men whose genes were more\ndissimilar from theirs. (Coincidentally, the eﬀect reverses for\nwomen on oral birth control. Things can get awkward when a\ncouple marries, the woman goes oﬀ birth control, and suddenly,\nshe’s attracted to diﬀerent people.)\n\f\n4) Shared Hobbies\nOnce, when I was on a road trip with an old friend, we started talking about\nhow she and her husband love tennis. That conversation carried us all the way to\nthe gas station. She got out of the car and browsed her phone while \u0000lling up the\ntank. When she climbed back in, she thrust her phone in my face and said,\n“Look. Aren’t my in-laws cute?” Her screen showed a blurry, poorly executed\nsel\u0000e of a couple in their sixties.\nAs she started the car, she said, “Honestly, it’s surprising my husband’s\nparents have been married for so long. They have nothing in common.”\n“People often think shared hobbies matter more than they do,” I responded.\n“It’s possible you’re underestimating all the things they do share.” By then she\nhad already heard me talk about the Gottmans. (Along with obscure Weird Al\ntrivia, I usually mention the Gottmans before the \u0000rst pit stop on a road trip.)\nJohn Gottman, whom I mentioned earlier, is married to Julie Gottman, a\nnoted clinical psychologist. John chose to spend many years of his life in a lab,\ncoding the micro-expressions of couples. Unsurprisingly, he considers himself\n“an avid indoorsman.” He jokes that he’s the kind of person who can think of a\nthousand ways to die at a picnic. Julie shares his passion for helping couples. But\nJulie’s idea of fun is spending time in the wilderness. She was a competitive skier\nin college. For her \u0000ftieth birthday, she dreamed of hiking to Everest Base Camp.\nImagine John, the guy afraid of picnics, ice-picking his way up Mount Everest\nwith Julie.\nOf course, John and Julie knew about these di\u0000erences before they got\nmarried. Yet, because of their work, they also understood that couples do not\nneed to share hobbies to create a successful long-term relationship. And they’ve\nbeen happily married for more than thirty years.\nHere’s the key: It’s \u0000ne to have di\u0000erent interests, so long as the time you\nspend pursuing your favorite activities doesn’t preclude you from investing in\nthe relationship. If you love wine and your partner couldn’t care less about it,\nthat’s okay; you don’t need to marry a sommelier. What matters is that when\nyou drink wine, or go on a trip to Napa to try a new prized cabernet sauvignon,\nyour partner doesn’t try to make you feel guilty or say something like “Why do\n\f\nyou always have to drink?” A good relationship has space for di\u0000erent people\nwith di\u0000erent hobbies.\nKey tip for your dating search\nDon’t worry about ﬁnding someone with the same hobbies. It’s\nﬁne to enjoy different activities as long as you give each other\nthe space and freedom to explore those hobbies on your own."

    "raw_text": "THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT OTHER (OSO)\nOne technique for managing diﬀerent hobbies is the “other\nsigniﬁcant other” (OSO), a phrase coined by relationship scientist\nEli Finkel. Modern couples often assume they can get all of their\nneeds met by their romantic partner. They expect this one person\nto wear many hats—in fact, almost all of the hats; hats that had\nbeen dispersed among our social network before we were\nmarried.\nExpecting our partners to fulﬁll all our needs puts a lot of\npressure on relationships. OSOs help alleviate that pressure.\nThink of it this way: If you try to pile dozens of hats on one\nperson’s head, the pile (and maybe the person) will topple over.\nInstead, you can give the baseball cap to your sports-loving cousin\nand call her when you want to talk RBIs. You can give the cowboy\nhat to your friend who loves country music and make plans with\nhim the next time you want a two-stepping partner.\nResearch from social psychologists Elaine Cheung, Wendi\nGardner, and Jason Anderson supports this idea. They found that\nhaving multiple people you can turn to for emotional needs—\nrather than just one or two—leads to an increase in your overall\nwell-being. For example, you might talk to your roommate when\nyou’re angry and depend on your sister when you’re sad.\nWhen you’re in a relationship, here’s how you can incorporate\nOSOs into your life. Consider what roles you’ve asked your\npartner to play that they are uninterested in fulﬁlling: for\nexample, insisting they go to a party with you when they much\nprefer smaller gatherings. Or wishing your partner would\nsuggest visits to museums and art galleries when it’s just not\ntheir thing. Remember, just because they don’t share all your\ninterests doesn’t make them a bad partner! And for those roles\nyour partner isn’t suited for, ﬁnd a friend or family member who\ncan ﬁll in. In the long run, this will make you happier because your\nneeds are being met. And it will make your partner happier"

    "raw_text": "because they can focus on roles that match their skills and\ninterests.\nWHAT MATTERS MORE THAN WE THINK\nWhen I work with clients, I rarely hear them say their number one goal is to \u0000nd\nsomeone who’s emotionally stable. Or good at making hard decisions.\nSometimes they’ll mention kindness, but usually after telling me their height\nminimum and maximum. And yet these are all examples of qualities that\nrelationship scientists have found contribute much more to long-term\nrelationship success than super\u0000cial traits or shared interests.\nIt’s not that people don’t know that this stu\u0000 matters; rather, they just tend\nto underestimate the value of these attributes when deciding whom to date.\n(One reason is that these qualities can be hard to measure. They may be\ndiscernible only after spending time with someone. This also explains why\ndating apps focus on the easier-to-measure, matter-less-than-you-think traits,\nbut more on that in the next chapter.) If you want to \u0000nd a Life Partner, look for\nsomeone with the following traits:\n1) Emotional Stability and Kindness\nIn his book The Science of Happily Ever After, psychologist Ty Tashiro digs into\nthe existing research on what matters when choosing a partner. He found that\nemotional stability and kindness are two of the most important and yet\nunderrated characteristics. He de\u0000nes emotional stability as being able to self-\nregulate and not give in to anger or impulsivity. The combined emotional\nstability of a couple predicts the satisfaction and stability of their relationship.\nIn his 2017 TED Talk, Tashiro notes that “Kind partners are awesome.\nThey’re generous, they’re empathic, and they want to be supportive of you.”\nKindness and emotional stability also allow us to treat our partner with care and\ncompassion, which research from John and Julie Gottman suggests is the key to\nlong-term relationship success.\n\f\nKey tip for your dating search\nYou can get a sense of how kind someone is by paying\nattention to how they treat people from whom they don’t need\nanything. Are they nice to the waiter? Do they give up their seat\non the subway? Are they patient with new team members who\nare learning the ropes at work? Do they treat their friends and\nparents with compassion?\nOne way to get a sense of someone’s emotional stability is\nto pay attention to how they respond to stressful situations. Do\nthey freak out or keep their cool? Emotionally stable partners\nare measured in their responses. They take time to\nthoughtfully respond rather than impulsively react. When I\nexplain this concept to my clients, I quote Viktor Frankl, a\nHolocaust survivor and celebrated psychiatrist. He wrote:\n“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that\nspace is our power to choose our response. In our response\nlies our growth and our freedom.” Someone who is emotionally\nstable takes advantage of that space.\n2) Loyalty\nYou know those fair-weather friends who are with you when life is going great\nbut forget your number when you need help? A fair-weather friend may be \u0000ne\nin certain situations, but you don’t want a fair-weather partner. Find someone\nwho will be there for the good and the bad. Loyalty matters.\nI often think about a passage my sister read in a speech at her wedding. (I also\noften think about how she rejected my multiple bids to o\u0000ciate—who wouldn’t\nwant a modern-day yenta with them under the chuppah?) It’s from an article by\nRobin Schoenthaler, a doctor who treats cancer patients, called “Will He Hold\nYour Purse?”\nSchoenthaler explains that she’s observed thousands of couples going\nthrough a crisis, which has taught her what really matters in a relationship: “It’s\na privilege to witness these couples, but the downside is I \u0000nd myself muttering\nunder my breath when my single female friends show me their ads for online\ndating. ‘Must like long walks on beach at sunset, cats,’ they write, or ‘French\n\f\nfood, kayaking, travel.’ Or a perennial favorite: ‘Looking for \u0000shing buddy; must\nbe good with bait.’ These ads make me want to climb onto my cancer doctor\nsoapbox and proclaim, ‘Finding friends with \u0000ne \u0000shing poles may be great in\nthe short term. But what you really want to look for is somebody who will hold\nyour purse in the cancer clinic.’ ”\nMy sister found a wonderful man who will hold her purse whenever she\nneeds him to. In other words, she married someone who shows up for her, who\ntakes care of her when she’s down. Look for loyalty. Look for someone who’s\nthere for you whether you’ve won an industry award or are stuck in the cancer\nward.\nKey tip for your dating search\nOne easy way to estimate someone’s loyalty is to see if they\nhave friends from different stages of their lives. How many old\nfriendships have they carried with them over the years? Did\nthey ditch their college bestie when they got depressed, or do\nthey still meet up for monthly movie matinees? Do people from\ntheir past seem to rely on them for companionship and\nsupport? Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, since\nsome people have moved around a lot or lived in places where\nthey didn’t ﬁt in. But in general, old friendships indicate loyalty.\n3) A Growth Mindset\nStanford psychologist Carol Dweck has spent decades studying what she calls\n“\u0000xed” and “growth” mindsets. People with a growth mindset believe that they\ncan improve their intelligence and skills. They love to learn. They’re motivated\nby challenges and see failure as a sign that they need to stretch their abilities.\nThey’re resilient and comfortable taking risks. Someone with a \u0000xed mindset\nbelieves the opposite: that talent and intelligence are assigned at birth and taking\na risk only presents an opportunity to embarrass yourself.\nYou want to align yourself with someone who has a growth mindset because\nwhen problems arise, which they inevitably will, you’ll want a partner who will\nrise to the occasion, not throw up their hands in defeat. A person with a growth\n\f\nmindset is much more likely to buckle down and work on improving things\nrather than give up on the relationship and assume things can’t be \u0000xed.\nKey tip for your dating search\nYou can spot people with a growth mindset by paying attention\nto how they handle themselves in different situations.\nHOW TO SPOT A GROWTH MINDSET\nSituation Fixed Growth\nHow they approach\nchallenges\nAvoid them Embrace them\nHow they respond to\nsetbacks\nGive up Persist\nHow they view learning new\nskills\nAs a chance to embarrass\nthemselves\nAs a chance to grow\nHow they respond to\nsomeone else’s\naccomplishments\nFeel threatened Feel inspired\nHow they speak to\nthemselves\nWith condemnation from a\nloud inner critic\nWith self-compassion\n4) Personality That Brings Out the Best in You\nIn the end, a relationship is not about who each of you is separately, it’s about\nwhat happens when the two of you come together. What does this person bring\nout in you? Does their kindness make you feel relaxed and cared for? Or does\ntheir anxiety provoke your anxiety? You must understand what qualities they\nbring out in you, because this is who you’ll be whenever you’re with them.\nA client met a guy who seemed perfect on paper. He had everything she\nthought she was looking for, especially in terms of intelligence and career\nsuccess. Unfortunately, whenever they were together, he made her feel small.\nHe’d ask her why she chose a certain recipe that was clearly above her cooking\nskill level. Or he’d make fun of the framed Picasso posters that hung on her wall.\nShe’d leave dates with him questioning her decisions—and herself. At \u0000rst, she"

    "raw_text": "thought his criticisms made her stronger. She tried to convince me he was merely\ntrying to “up her game.” But through our work together, she realized that he was\nactually very insecure and that his insecurity triggered her own insecurity. It\ndidn’t matter what he looked like on paper. In person, he made her feel bad\nabout herself. She refused to choose a lifetime of self-doubt and ended things\nwith him.\nOne of my friends says his girlfriend makes him feel competent. She asks for\nhis advice—and takes it. She relies on him in a way that makes him feel\nimportant and capable. He loves the side of him that she brings out.\nKey tip for your dating search\nPay attention to how you feel when you’re around this person\nor right after you ﬁnish spending time together. Energized?\nDeﬂated? Bored? Challenged? Happy? Desired? Smart?\nStupid? Select someone who brings out the best side of you.\nIt could also be helpful to get a third-party view by going out\nwith a group of friends. Instead of asking, “What did you think\nof him?” ask, “What did you think of me around him?”\n5) Skills to Fight Well\nFights aren’t fun, but they don’t necessarily spell disaster. If you lacked\nrelationship role models who demonstrated how to \u0000ght and how to make up,\ndon’t fret. You can learn to \u0000ght well.\nFights—anything from a small disagreement to a screaming match—are a\nchance to deal with things as they come up instead of letting resentment build.\nA friend of mine prided himself on not \u0000ghting with his girlfriend. She had\ndecorated their house, and he felt like there was no room for him. His interests\nand his stu\u0000 were not represented. He wanted to bring it up, but because he\nbelieved that avoiding con\u0000ict was a sign of a healthy relationship, he didn’t. He\ngrew more and more resentful of her over time. The lack of physical\nrepresentation in their shared space started to seem like a metaphor for their\nwhole relationship—he didn’t see himself in it. He stopped investing in their\npartnership and began to spend most of his time at work, where he had his own\n\f\no\u0000ce. By the time he \u0000nally broached the issue, it was too late. Too much space\nand resentment had grown between them, and they decided to end their \u0000ve-\nyear relationship.\nThe \u0000rst step in \u0000ghting well is understanding that there are two types of\nproblems in relationships: solvable problems and perpetual ones—unsolvable,\npermanent features of your partnership. John Gottman discovered that 69\npercent of all relationship con\u0000icts are perpetual.\nCommon examples of perpetual problems include situations where one\nperson likes to go out while the other prefers to stay in, or where one person is\nneat and the other is messy. These might include di\u0000ering opinions on work,\nfamily, ambition, money, and sexual frequency.\nImagine that you’re someone who arrives \u0000ve (okay, ten) minutes late to\neverything, and your signi\u0000cant other grew up in a family with the slogan “Early\nis on time, on time is late, and late means don’t bother showing up.” You’ll\ninevitably \u0000ght over punctuality. You may \u0000nd solutions to manage this\ndi\u0000erence, like going to the airport separately, but it’s unlikely that you’ll solve\nthe problem. The goal is not to convince each other to change or even to come to\nan agreement—it’s to \u0000nd a productive way to live with this di\u0000erence.\nAs the late couples therapist Dan Wile explained in his book After the\nHoneymoon: “When choosing a long-term partner, you will inevitably be\nchoosing a particular set of unresolvable problems.” The goal isn’t to \u0000nd\nsomeone with whom you don’t \u0000ght. It’s to choose a partner with whom you\n\u0000ght well, and who doesn’t make you worry that the \u0000ght will end the\nrelationship. The second element to \u0000ghting well is being able to recover from a\ndisagreement. John Gottman writes about “repair attempts,” statements or\nactions that prevent a \u0000ght from escalating. Successful couples are able to break\nthe intensity of a \u0000ght by making a joke, conceding a point, or telling their\npartner what they appreciate about them.\nKey tip for your dating search\nRemember that you’ll inevitably have disagreements with\nwhomever you choose. Pay attention to how you ﬁght. Are you\nable to get your point across? Do you feel heard? Does your\n\f\npartner make repair attempts to de-escalate the\ndisagreement? The goal is to ﬁght well, not to avoid ﬁghts\naltogether.\n6) Ability to Make Hard Decisions with You\nYou and your partner will, at some point, face tough choices. What do you do if\none of you gets an unbelievable job o\u0000er in another city? Or if you need to raise\na child with a disability? How will you handle aging parents who need around-\nthe-clock care? You want to be with someone who can make hard decisions with\nyou.\nOne of my clients dated someone who lost her job the \u0000rst month they were\ndating: She had to simultaneously mourn the loss of her dream job and look for\nnew work. If she couldn’t \u0000nd something good quickly, she had to decide if she\nwanted to stay in San Francisco or move back east. While this was challenging,\nmy client said that helping her through these tough choices revealed how well\nthey functioned together in a challenging situation. It certainly wasn’t fun, but\nit demonstrated their compatibility and strengthened their relationship.\nKey tip for your dating search\nThe best way to know what it will be like to make decisions\nwith someone is to actually make decisions together. Real\ndecisions (read: not whether to order Chinese or Thai food).\nIt’s critical to stress-test your relationship. I am not\nrecommending that you artiﬁcially create a crisis (such as\ntexting: “HELP! Grandma’s been kidnapped!”), but I am\nrecommending you pay attention during shared experiences\nthat challenge both of you. For example, what happens when\nyou try to cook a complicated meal or travel internationally? Or\nwhen you’re driving together and your car breaks down in the\nmiddle of the road? What do you do when you’re each invited\nto a different wedding on the same weekend? How do you\nreact when you’re stuck deciding between two equally good (or\nequally bad) options?"

    "raw_text": "Dan Ariely offers something called “the canoe test.” Share a\ncanoe. Yes, an actual canoe. Can you ﬁnd a rhythm together?\nIs one of you comfortable leading and the other following, or\ndo you both want to be in charge at all times? Most important,\nhow much do you blame your partner when things go awry?\nPay attention to how you literally navigate choppy water\ntogether as a team.\nLEAVING THE PROM DATE AT THE PROM\nAs you’ve seen, the things that matter less than we think for long-term\nrelationship success tend to be super\u0000cial traits that are easy to discern when you\n\u0000rst meet someone. And the things that matter more usually reveal themselves\nonly when you’re in a relationship or have gone on at least a few dates. That’s\nwhy you have to intentionally shift your approach in order to focus on what\nreally matters.\nMaking that shift is hard. I know because I did it.\nA long time ago, on a Saturday night about four months after Burning Man,\nI texted Brian to see what he was doing that night.\n“I’m going to Bootie,” he texted back, referring to a local dance party where\nDJs dress up as robots or pirates and drag queens vogue onstage. I wanted to join\nhim but he didn’t invite me.\nMy countero\u0000er: dinner, on me, beforehand. I \u0000gured that if I could remind\nhim how much fun we had dancing in the desert, he’d ask me to join him.\nAfter dinner I talked my way into joining his friends’ pregame. Several drinks\ndeep, I insisted on accompanying them to Bootie.\nWe stood outside as his friends entered the club. I was freezing, in a short\nleather skirt with a silk tank top tucked in (I’d chosen this out\u0000t hoping to score\nan invite, and without considering San Francisco’s notoriously cold summer\nnights). I shifted my weight back and forth on my wobbling heels.\nHe put his hands on my bare shoulders and looked me in the eyes. “Please\ndon’t follow me in. I want to go out with my friends and meet girls. You need to\ngo home.”\n\f\nI cried and pleaded, but thirty minutes later, he walked away to join his\nfriends inside the club.\nWhere had I gone wrong? No dating advice I’d encountered had covered that\nmoment in your life when you’re on the street, alone, outside of a lame club,\neyeliner and snot dripping down your face, pining after someone who sends\nmixed messages and makes you feel foolish.\nThis wasn’t my \u0000rst time pursuing someone like Brian. I knew I was going\nafter the wrong people, but I didn’t know how to \u0000x it. A week later, desperate\nto feel like I was still moving forward, I hired Nadia, a new age dating coach. (I\ndidn’t yet work in the business of love.)\nNadia and I sat cross-legged on the rug in her o\u0000ce/living room/Zen\ngarden/energy nexus. She helped me understand that I liked Brian because he\nwas fun and exciting to be around but that he wasn’t really what I was looking\nfor in a husband, and I didn’t like the anxious side of me he brought out. In her\nstern Russian accent, she said, “Your homework is to focus on how you want to\nfeel in your relationship.”\nDuring our next meeting, I shared my response: “I want him to make me feel\nsmart, funny, appreciated, and secure in our relationship.”\nNadia nodded approvingly.\nOn the long walk home from that session, homework in hand, I felt\nfrustrated. As much as I appreciated Nadia’s help, I was still obsessing over\nBrian. Even in that moment, I wondered where he was and what (or whom) he\nwas thinking about.\nI checked my phone and considered sending him a text. In that moment, a\ncalendar invitation popped up. It was from a guy at work named Scott.\nWe’d met eight years earlier, when we’d had lunch together in college with\nsome mutual friends. The summer before this one, he’d reintroduced himself at\nthe Google shuttle stop. Shortly after that, I’d invited him to another lunch—\nthis time a Harvard alumni gathering at work. During that meal, I’d announced\nthat I wanted to learn the statistics coding language R. He said he’d just dropped\nout of a math PhD program and o\u0000ered to tutor me.\nWe started meeting weekly at work. He was a natural teacher—kind, patient,\nfunny. “Based on the visualization you produced in R, what can you say about\n\f\nthe distribution of eruption times for Old Faithful?” he asked me in one\ntutoring session.\n“It’s bimodal?”\n“Yes!” he cheered, high-\u0000ving me.\nUnfortunately, he undermined our budding \u0000irtation by mentioning his\ndislike of exotic travel and the Burning Man crowd. I wrote him o\u0000.\nBut that was before. On that walk home, I realized Scott had many of the\nqualities that I’d told Nadia I was looking for. And he made me feel smart,\nfunny, appreciated, and secure in our relationship.\nWhen I reevaluated Scott through the new lens of what mattered, I realized\nthose initial surface-level preferences were distractions. I loved how I felt around\nhim, even if he shuddered at the idea of staying up all night and partying in the\ndesert. In the years since, I’ve discovered that Nadia’s advice was not just smart—\nit was backed by mounds of research.\nThat fateful Saturday, walking through Dolores Park, looking down at the\nSan Francisco skyline, I replied “yes” to his invitation for lunch.\nThat lunch turned into a weekly—and then daily—activity. We started\ncalling each other to commiserate after our terrible online dates with strangers.\nHe and his friend recorded a YouTube show—a parody of tech called “Silly\nValley”—near my house, and we’d meet up for a few minutes before or after\ntheir tapings.\nOne day, as we said goodbye to each other after yet another lunch, he\nretrieved a white \u0000ower that had escaped a tree and put it into my hair.\n“It feels like we’re in a haiku,” he said.\nI told him I was free that Friday, and he asked me out. (So, technically, I asked\nhim out.)\nScott was nothing like Brian. He made his interest in me clear. I felt excited to\nsee him and spend time with him. There wasn’t that voice in the back of my\nhead wondering, Does he like me? because I knew he did. He’d send me texts like\n“I’m excited to spend time with you today”; “I like your brain”; and “I just want\nto rush into things with you.”\nTwo weeks after our \u0000rst o\u0000cial date, I sent him an aggressive text, annoyed\nabout something he’d said. I knew from past relationships that this would\n\f\nlaunch us into a \u0000ght. I would sit on my couch, angrily poking at my phone,\nheart racing, eyes unblinking, as I rage-typed my disappointment in a volley of\nshort, combative texts. I knew what would happen next: We’d go back and forth\nuntil I got so upset that I’d revert to some trusted old protest behaviors, likely\nignoring his calls and texts. (Let’s hear it for anxious-attachment styles!)\nBut we never went down that road. Instead, Scott wrote back, “Let’s chat in\nperson about this one.” It was my \u0000rst time dating someone so secure. It was a\ncompletely new experience. We discussed issues instead of careering head\u0000rst\ninto arguments. (It doesn’t hurt that his mom is a therapist.)\nIt’s been six years since I invited Scott to that lunch at Google.\nWe’ve now shared two Burning Mans (he eventually came around to it), a\n\u0000ve-day scuba diving trip in Thailand, and an apartment. We’ve killed one basil\nplant and three succulents.\nWe’re happy. We say R is our love language.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Relationship science can teach us what really matters for\ncommitted long-term relationships. Seek Life Partners:\npeople who are trustworthy and reliable and who will stay\nwith you for the long haul. Avoid Prom Dates: individuals\nwho are fun in the short term but ultimately let you down.\n2. Superﬁcial qualities like looks and money matter less for\nlong-term relationship success than people think they do\nbecause lust fades and people adapt to their circumstances.\nThe same goes for shared hobbies and similar personalities.\n3. A great long-term partner is loyal, kind, and emotionally\nstable, a person with whom you can grow, make hard\ndecisions, and ﬁght constructively.\n4. In the end, a relationship is about what happens when the\ntwo of you come together. Focus on the side of you this\nperson brings out, because that’s who you’ll be whenever\nyou’re with them."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 8\nYOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU\nWANT, BUT YOU’RE WRONG\nHow to Avoid the Pitfalls of Online Dating\nI once swiped left on Scott on Tinder.\nI told you how I met him—in college and then years later at the Google\nshuttle stop. What I neglected to mention is that before he started tutoring me, I\nsaw him on Tinder. I \u0000ipped through his photos and then rejected him.\nIt was 2014, and I was heading home from work on the shuttle bus, stuck in\nSan Francisco’s dreary tra\u0000c, when Tinder served up a photo of a guy who\nlooked vaguely familiar. We had enough friends in common that I knew we must\nhave gone to the same college. Backward baseball hat. Tank top. Unsmiling eyes\nsquinting harshly into the sun. He looked like a bro. Not my type. I swiped left.\nWhy did I reject this person—someone who has made me very happy—when\nI saw him online? How did I come to such an inaccurate conclusion about him?\nI thought I knew what I wanted and what would make me happy in a long-\nterm relationship. And I believed I could accurately evaluate someone based on a\nfew photos.\nI was wrong on both counts.\nI’m not the only one prone to these kinds of errors. Many of my clients have\neverything going for them—great personalities, friends, hobbies, and so on—\nbut remain perpetually single. Why? They’re dating wrong. It’s not their fault,\nand it’s not yours. We can often blame it on the apps.\nAccording to research by Stanford sociology professor Michael J. Rosenfeld,\n“met online” is the most common way romantic partners connect today,\n\f\nfollowed by “met in a bar or restaurant” and then “met through friends.” (Less\ncommon responses included: “at the rodeo,” “while complaining to random\nstrangers about how much I hate these f**king dating apps,” and “Red\nLobster.”)\nIn the last twenty years, digital dating has exploded: Rosenfeld found that\nwhile only 2 percent of couples met online in 1995, 39 percent now meet that\nway. And as more couples connect digitally, fewer meet through social\nconnections—like friends, family, and work—or through communities like\nschool and church.\nMuch like we’ve seen with all social media giants, while apps create many\nthriving relationships, they can also perpetuate harmful cognitive biases among\ntheir users. Since so many people are meeting this way—and even people who\ndon’t use the apps often go out with people who do—app makers have a subtle\nbut astonishing amount of power over our love lives. They are designing the\nenvironment in which we make decisions about dating. And, by extension, they\ndeeply in\u0000uence the decisions we make.\nTraditional economics assumes people have consistent, static preferences. But\nbehavioral scientists know that’s a lie. The truth is, our environment matters.\nWe’re impacted by the setting in which we make our decision, whether that’s a\nphysical location or a digital landscape. What we choose is highly a\u0000ected by\nhow the options are displayed. We may think preferences are permanent, but\nthey’re actually rather pliable.\nHere’s an example of how that plays out with our food choices. A few years\nago, Google diagnosed its employees with “an M&M problem.” To nudge them\ninto making healthier food decisions, an internal team of behavioral scientists\nchanged the environment in which the snacks were presented. They stopped\no\u0000ering M&M’s in giant clear bins that enticed snackers with the multicolored\nchocolate treats. They moved the candies to clearly labeled but opaque\ncontainers, where they would be less tempting. Healthier snacks, like dried \u0000gs\nand pistachios, sat nearby in clear glass jars.\nThese were bright tech workers who had known the healthy snacks were\navailable the whole time. But merely changing the environment in which food\nchoices were presented resulted in employees eating 3.1 million fewer M&M"

According to the\nWashington Post, which covered the experiment, “that’s a decrease of nine\nvending machine-size packages of M&M’s for each of the o\u0000ce’s 2,000\nemployees.” In the Google o\u0000ce, nothing changed about the employees’\npreferences.

That\nenvironment had a huge impact on employees’ choices.\nWhen it comes to modern dating, our decision-making environment is the\ndating app. We’re a\u0000ected by the way the app presents certain matches and the\norder in which those matches appear on our screens. That’s why my clients tell\nme about swiping no on someone on one app and then swiping yes on that same\nperson on a di\u0000erent app a few weeks later. These small contextual di\u0000erences\nhave a big impact on our decisions.\nTo be clear, I am not anti-app. Apps have introduced millions of happy\ncouples who may not have met otherwise. Dating apps have been especially\nmeaningful for singles in so-called thin markets, including the LGBTQ+\ncommunity; people in sparsely populated areas; and daters over the age of \u0000fty.\nAnd not all dating apps are the same. I’m a fan of those that focus on helping\npeople get o\u0000 the app and on real dates.\n(In fact, after writing this book I took a job as the Director of Relationship\nScience at Hinge. Not only is Hinge singularly focused on getting their users o\u0000\nthe apps and on real dates—as evidenced by their slogan “Designed to be\ndeleted”—they also hired me to do exactly what I hope to accomplish with this\nbook: help millions of people around the world learn how to date more\ne\u0000ectively.)\nBut unfortunately, the way that certain dating apps present information can\ncause us to focus on the wrong things.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. I’ll teach you how to make the apps work for\nyou so that you can take advantage of digital dating while avoiding possible\npitfalls.\nWE’RE DATING WRONG"

    "raw_text": "I was in the middle of writing an email when Jonathan knocked at my door,\n\u0000fteen minutes late for his \u0000rst session. I had \u0000gured he wasn’t going to show.\n“Sorry, sorry!” he said, extending his giant hand to me. “I got stuck at work.”\nJonathan was tall, \u0000t, and charming. His dimples appeared when he smiled or\npronounced the letter “c,” as in “CEO,” his current title. He was from the\nMidwest and had lived in San Francisco for about \u0000ve years. He’d been single for\nmost of them, save for a few connections that had seemed promising but then\n\u0000zzled. After years of struggling on dating apps, he’d come to me for help.\nDuring our \u0000rst few sessions, I learned what a high standard Jonathan held\nhimself to and how successful he’d been in other areas of his life: student body\npresident in college, winner of major international awards, Rhodes Scholar, and\nmore. He was ambitious but also thoughtful and funny. (You know, the kind of\nperson your parents would longingly compare you to.)\nHe said, “I’ve been using the apps, and I’ve been on a ton of dates. I know\nwhat I want, but I just haven’t found him yet. I’m looking for an in-shape\nbusiness executive who’s at least six-four. Can you help?”\n“Yes, I can help,” I responded. “But not in the way you think.”\nJonathan didn’t need an introduction to the right tall businessman. He\nneeded to completely reset his mindset for dating. That began with\nunderstanding all the ways in which the apps were a\u0000ecting him.\nIssue #1: Our brains focus on what’s measurable and easily\ncomparable. Apps display superﬁcial traits, making us value these\nqualities even more.\nAs we discussed in the previous chapter, decades of relationship science have\nrevealed what matters for long-term relationship success: things like if the person\nis emotionally stable, kind, and loyal, and how that person makes us feel.\nYet current dating apps don’t let you search for any of those qualities. How\ncould they? It’s hard enough to accurately measure personality traits, let alone\nwhat those traits would elicit in you. Instead, dating apps are limited by the\ninformation they can reliably capture and catalog: height, age, college, job, and\n\f\nhow good someone is at selecting \u0000attering pictures that make them look cool\nyet approachable, sexy but playful.\nThis is a problem. As management consultants love to say, “You are what you\nmeasure.” In a column on this topic for the Harvard Business Review, behavioral\neconomist Dan Ariely wrote: “Human beings adjust behavior based on the\nmetrics they’re held against. Anything you measure will impel a person to\noptimize his score on that metric. What you measure is what you’ll get. Period.”\nIf you create a frequent-\u0000yer reward system where you measure miles \u0000own and\ntell customers that this number matters, Ariely explained, customers respond.\nThey start booking absurd \u0000ights from faraway airports to maximize their miles.\nIn other words, we’re suggestible—show us a metric and we’ll assume it’s\nimportant. While people have always prized certain super\u0000cial traits, the apps\nmake us think they’re even more important simply by measuring, presenting,\nand emphasizing them.\nUniversity of Chicago professor Chris Hsee writes about a related concept\ncalled evaluability: The easier it is to compare certain traits, the more important\nthose traits seem.\nImagine this scenario (and for the sake of this thought experiment, imagine\nyou’re interested in men). I walk up to you on the street and say: “You can go on\na date with one of these two single men. One guy is \u0000ve-nine and one is \u0000ve-ten,\nbut the shorter one makes more money. Who do you want to go out with?”\nMost likely, you’d walk away slowly, confused why a stranger was asking you\nsuch a weird question. If you decided to stick around, I’d follow up with another\nquestion: “How much more money per year would a shorter guy have to make\nfor you to \u0000nd him as attractive as a taller man?”\nAt that point, you might laugh awkwardly and tell me it was impossible to\ncome up with such a number. But thanks to research from Dan Ariely, we know\nit’s not. He discovered that there is, in fact, a quanti\u0000able correlation between\nheight, income, and \u0000nding success on the dating apps. And it’s not small. Using\ndata from a popular dating website, Ariely found that a man has to earn $40,000\nmore each year to be as desirable as a man one inch taller.\nYes: $40,000.\n\f\nEvaluability helps us understand why. In real life, you may meet guys who are\n\u0000ve-nine and \u0000ve-ten and barely notice their height di\u0000erence. (And you\ncertainly won’t know their income—unless they tell you, unprompted, which is\ngross.) But as we just learned, the more a quality can be compared, the more\nimportant that trait seems. Apps make it easy to compare height. While women\nhave long favored tall men, the digital world exacerbates this preference. Because\nof the explicit height comparison across online dating pro\u0000les, shorter men are at\na much greater disadvantage than they would be in the real world. No wonder\nJonathan was so focused on the height of his potential husband!\nYou may be asking yourselves, how much does a woman’s income a\u0000ect her\ndesirability? Turns out it doesn’t. High earners don’t inspire single men on that\ndating website the way they inspire single women. Instead, the quality that men\ncared about most when evaluating attractiveness was body mass index (BMI).\nThey preferred a woman whose BMI was 18.5—slightly underweight—and\ndidn’t care about her salary or her level of education. Again, it’s not that men\nactually value thinness in potential life partners above all else—they’re just stuck\nworking with a limited set of comparable qualities. (Also, ughhhhh.)\nWhich brings me back to why I swiped left on Scott on Tinder. I was\nselecting potential partners based on the super\u0000cial traits featured on the dating\napps, and I’d created an image of an ideal partner that he just didn’t \u0000t. If you’d\nasked me when I was swiping what I’d wanted in a partner, do you think I\nwould’ve said “\u0000ve-eight redheaded vegan engineer”? No, probably not. I easily\ncould have set a height minimum of \u0000ve-nine and never even seen Scott. Yet—\nafter dating more than my fair share of people—I found that he is the man who\nmakes me the happiest. (And it turns out he’s nothing like the bro his pictures\nmade him out to be.)\nThis is all to say that the apps may lead us astray by emphasizing measurable\nand comparable qualities. They can trick us into valuing these traits while\nignoring the qualities that relationship science tells us matter most.\nIssue #2: We think we know what we want, but we’re wrong. The\napps allow us to ﬁlter out great potential matches.\n\f\nMy clients often come to me with long checklists of all the qualities they want in\na partner. But the strange thing is that most of us have not dated that many\npeople. We have relatively little experience, especially where it counts for \u0000guring\nout compatibility in long-term relationships. Yet we think we are experts in what\nwill make us happy.\nThis is a major point! Underline this next sentence, please: Most of us have\nno idea what kind of partner will ful\u0000ll us long term.\nYes, we think we know what we want. Yes, we have that long checklist. But\nthose are likely not the qualities possessed by the person we fall in love with. Our\neventual partner may be completely di\u0000erent from what we expected.\nRemember, I wasn’t looking for a vegan engineer.\nBeing wrong about who would make you happy long term is not a new\nproblem created by technology. But in real life, you’re exposed to all kinds of\npotential partners: tall and short, fat and thin, intellectual, funny, introverted,\nreligious, atheist, whatever. If you’re looking for a partner in the physical world\n—at a book club, a pottery class, your friend’s birthday party—you meet people\nwho aren’t your so-called type. You could develop a \u0000irtation, and then a\nrelationship, with one of them. You might be pleasantly surprised by how wrong\nyou were about needing to date someone who, say, is taller than you or grew up\nreligious.\nBut dating apps never give you the chance to be proved wrong, because you\ncan weed out people who aren’t your “type.” I once conducted in-person\ninterviews with folks who met their husband or wife o\u0000ine. I asked, “If you had\nseen your current spouse online, would you have swiped right or left?” Many\npeople told me they wouldn’t have seen their future partner at all because their\napp settings would’ve shut them out. “My age limit was up to one year older\nthan me, and she’s \u0000ve years older than me,” one guy told me. “My app setting\nwas for Jewish men only, and he identi\u0000es as Buddhist,” another said.\nMany digital services require you to go through an onboarding process when\nyou sign up. Net\u0000ix, for example, asks what kinds of movies you like. For dating\napps, it’s what kind of people: What’s the youngest person you’d date? What’s\nthe oldest? What’s the tallest or shortest person you’d date? Do you care if this\nperson smokes? Does drugs? Drinks?"

    "raw_text": "From a practical perspective, it makes sense that apps use the onboarding\nprocess to limit the number of potential matches. Dating apps can’t show us an\nin\u0000nite number of people. They have to narrow things down somehow. But\nmost people aren’t making these decisions carefully. You see, during the\nonboarding phase, users are in a rush to see potential matches as quickly as\npossible. They answer the questions with about as much forethought as they’d\nuse when \u0000lling out a make-your-own sandwich form at the grocery store. But\nunlike smoked turkey, Dijon mustard, and extra-sharp cheddar, the ingredients\nwe hastily select for our dating pro\u0000les may or may not make us happy.\nThese decisions have a huge impact on our dating experience. The constraints\nwe set \u0000lter out potentially great matches. This would be like rushing through\nyour sandwich order because you’re hungry for lunch, marking o\u0000 a box that\nsays “Turkey only,” and then \u0000nding that every time you went to get a sandwich\nin the future, you could look at only turkey sandwiches.\nOf course, we could change our preferences on the dating apps after we sign\nup, but most people don’t. This is because of something called the status quo\nbias—our tendency to leave things as they are, to not rock the boat. That’s why\nbusinesses with subscription-service models tend to be lucrative. If you sign up\nfor a gym membership and it’s automatically renewed each month, you’re much\nless likely to make the call to cancel than if you had to decide every month\nwhether you want to keep the service.\nThe same thing happens when people sign up for a dating app. Once people\nset app preferences during onboarding, they’re very unlikely to change them.\nThe apps show us people who meet our initial criteria—the type of people we\nthink we want. If you believe that you’d hate dating a woman who’s taller than\nyou are, and the apps o\u0000er you only short women to choose from, you never get\nthe chance to be proved wrong.\nIssue #3: Apps promote “relationshopping”—searching for potential\npartners like potential purchases.\nMany of us conduct extensive research before making a purchase. If you wanted\nto buy a camera, for example, you might compare and contrast along every\n\f\npotential axis—megapixel count, image quality, weight, battery life, cost, and so\non. Dating apps create the illusion that we can do the same comparison\nshopping with potential partners.\nIn fact, while researchers once called the process of transitioning from\nstrangers or friends to romantic partners as “relationshipping,” they now speak\nof a new phenomenon—“relationshopping”—searching for our mate like we’d\nsearch for a new pair of shoes. But treating potential partners like potential\npurchases gets us into trouble.\nA team of behavioral economists, including Michael Norton and Dan Ariely,\nexplained in a research paper that many consumer items are “searchable goods”:\nthings like cameras, laundry detergent, and big-screen TVs that can be measured\nbased on their objective attributes. These di\u0000er from “experience goods,” which\nthey de\u0000ne as being “judged by the feelings they evoke, rather than the functions\nthey perform. Examples include movies, perfume, puppies, and restaurant meals\n—goods de\u0000ned by attributes that are subjective, aesthetic, holistic, emotive, and\ntied to the production of sensation. Most importantly, people must be present\nto evaluate them; they cannot be judged secondhand.” We’ve all seen a movie\nthat got bad reviews but made us laugh. Or tasted wine that earned amazing\nreviews but didn’t taste good to us. We’ve been pleasantly surprised or\nsurprisingly disappointed by experiencing these goods ourselves. The process of\nevaluation was more personal than just knowing that we wanted a wide-angle\nlens.\nPeople, the authors of this paper tell us, are experience goods. We are not like\ncameras. We are much more like wine. (If you’re like me, you’re also full-bodied,\na little dry, and getting better with age.) We cannot be understood by comparing\nand contrasting our parts. Yet dating apps have turned living, breathing, three-\ndimensional people into two-dimensional, searchable goods. They’ve given us\nthe false belief that we can break people down into their parts and compare them\nto \u0000nd the best one.\nApps primarily give us a list of résumé traits and nothing more. Only by\nspending time with someone can you appreciate that person for the “experiential\ngood” they are.\n\f\nIssue #4: Apps make us more indecisive about whom to date.\nThe \u0000rst night I downloaded Tinder, I spent six hours swiping. Yes, that’s longer\nthan it would take to binge-watch the entire \u0000rst season of Fleabag. I went\nthrough hundreds, possibly thousands, of pro\u0000les. As if it weren’t enough that\ndating apps can confuse us about what’s important, they can also make it harder\nto choose whom to go out with. Our brains aren’t set up to select a partner from\nso many options.\nRemember what psychologist Barry Schwartz discovered about the paradox\nof choice: We assume that more choice will make us happier, but that’s often not\nthe case. In fact, too many options make us less happy, in part because of choice\noverload. It can feel so overwhelming to compare our options that we may give\nup and make no decision at all.\nColumbia professor Sheena Iyengar and Stanford professor Mark Lepper\ndemonstrated this in a now-famous study. They entered a gourmet grocery store\nand set up a table of free gourmet jam samples. When they o\u0000ered twenty-four\ntypes of jam, people were more likely to approach the table than when they\no\u0000ered six jams. However, customers who sampled from among the twenty-four\njams were far less likely to buy any jams than those who encountered only six\noptions. The researchers hypothesized that when you have six options, it’s\npossible to make a con\u0000dent decision about which jam you’ll like the most. But\ntwenty-four options are so overwhelming that people often make no decision at\nall.\nIn a grocery store, that might mean leaving with no jam. In the world of\ndating apps, that means not \u0000nding a relationship (also, sadly, no jam). And\nselecting a potential partner is way harder than selecting a jam out of twenty-\nfour options: choosing from not just twenty-four but thousands of people and\nperhaps committing to one for the rest of your life. In dating, we may feel so\noverwhelmed by the options that we decide not to go on any dates at all. Even if\nwe do, it can feel impossible to know whom to date seriously.\nIt’s not just that too many choices make it hard to decide. Schwartz tells us\nthat even when we’re able to overcome choice overload and make a selection,\nhaving so many options to choose from makes us less satis\u0000ed with what we\n\f\nchoose. (This e\u0000ect can be ampli\u0000ed when you’re a Maximizer, as discussed in\nChapter 4.)\nWe start to think: What if I’d chosen something else? Would that have been\nbetter? Would I be happier? That train of thought leads down a dark path toward\nregret. And the e\u0000ect multiplies. The more options you have to choose from, the\nmore chances you have to feel regret about your selection. This can even lead to\nfeelings of depression.\nIn this case, more is less—or at least less ful\u0000lling.\nI’ve worked with all kinds of daters. I know that not everyone experiences the\nparadox of choice in dating. It depends on factors like race, age, gender,\norientation, and location, which all a\u0000ect the size of your dating pool. (Plenty of\nmy clients wish they had too many options to choose from.) But if you’re\nsomeone who’s getting a lot of matches, or you’re caught up in the game of\nseeing how many people you can swipe on, you might already understand the\nimpact of the paradox of choice. Remember, the point of a dating app is to go\nout on an actual date, not to spend all of your evenings swiping.\nIssue #5: When we see only a rough sketch of someone, we ﬁll in\nthe gaps with ﬂattering details. We create an unrealistic fantasy of\nthis person, which ultimately leaves us disappointed.\nIn Clueless, one of my all-time favorite movies, Tai, the new girl, asks Cher, the\nmost popular girl in school, what she thinks about their classmate Amber. Cher\nsays, “She’s a full-on Monet. It’s like a painting, see. From far away, it’s okay, but\nup close it’s a big ol’ mess.”\nI call this error in judgment the Monet E\u0000ect. When we have only a rough\nperception of someone, our brain, hoping for a great outcome, \u0000lls in all the\ngaps optimistically. People seem way more desirable than they actually are. It’s\nonly later, when they transform into real people standing in front of us, that we\nsee the \u0000aws.\nWe can see this play out in the corporate world. When companies search for a\nnew CEO, they can choose between promoting an internal candidate or hiring\nan external one. Research into these decisions found that companies who decide\n\f\nto hire externally have sky-high expectations of the candidates. When you\nevaluate external candidates, you know only the broad details about them. They\ntell you about their wins. Internal candidates, you know more intimately; you\nare familiar with their successes and their failures. The Monet E\u0000ect helps\nexplain why, when compared to internal candidates, external CEOs are often\npaid more but perform worse.\nThe same thing happens with dating. Looking at a dating app pro\u0000le is the\nequivalent of seeing someone from very far away. All you get are a few carefully\nselected photos and some basic information. You go out on the date, and maybe\nthe pitch of their voice bothers you or they have bad table manners or you are\nnot aligned on the time and place for dad jokes (them: always; you: on Full\nHouse reruns only). Instead of those \u0000aws seeming normal—because they are,\nand everyone has some—they leave you greatly disappointed. There goes the\nperfect person you built up in your mind. In the bathroom, you can’t help but\nopen Tinder. Time for the ol’ swipe-and-wipe. You give up on the date you’re on\nand start fantasizing about the next person on your screen, who seems perfect\nbecause of the Monet E\u0000ect. But as soon as you meet that match in person, you\nrealize they have \u0000aws, too, and the cycle continues. This creates a grass-is-\nalways-greener reaction: You always think the next thing will be better than what\nyou have. You’re dooming yourself to an endless cycle of unrealized connections.\nDATE SMARTER\nAll of these issues are working against you, making it harder to meaningfully\nchoose whom to date. You’re focusing on factors that are less important than\nyou think and comparing people in ways that don’t re\u0000ect their true potential.\nBut there are ways to use the apps to date smarter.\nChange Your Filters\nThe people you see on the apps are a re\u0000ection of the restrictions you set up\nwhen you joined. Think back to that time. There you were. You’d just\ndownloaded the app. You were full of hope. Birds were chirping. When asked to\nchoose your settings, such as height and age preferences, you likely rushed"

    "raw_text": "through this step, because you knew hundreds of potential love interests were\nwaiting for you on the other side.\nAnd, for all the reasons above, you might have made a mistake. While you\nmay think you know what you want in a partner, you’re probably wrong.\nTherefore, I want you to be more open-minded about whom you allow the apps\nto show you. Take out your phone and update your settings. Yes, on all the apps.\nYes, right now. For the people you’re \u0000ltering out, whom you once thought were\ntoo young or too old, could you be more \u0000exible? And would you really not date\na great person outside your stated height range?\nAlso think about your non-numerical requirements, like “must have graduate\ndegree” or “must be Catholic.” Those yes/no switches probably represent\npreferences for deeper values—intellectual curiosity or a connection to tradition\n—that the apps have di\u0000culty capturing.\nDo this now. Seriously, I’ll wait. (I’ve been craving a smoked turkey, Dijon\nmustard, and extra-sharp cheddar sandwich for the last \u0000fteen minutes anyway.)\nI completed this exercise with Jonathan. He broadened his height\nrequirements and immediately saw way more men than before. Intelligence and\nsense of humor were still must-haves, but Jonathan recognized that he’d have to\nlook for those qualities by reading people’s pro\u0000les, messaging with them, and\ngetting to know them on actual dates. The apps couldn’t \u0000lter those for him.\nChange How You Swipe\nYou’ve updated your selection settings. Now it’s time to update your selection\nprocess.\nChallenge your assumptions. One time I observed my client making her way\nthrough an app. We came across a guy who looked cute and had a funny bio. She\nswiped left. I asked her why, and she said, “He was a consultant, and consultants\nare boring.” What?! All consultants? Every single one? She was assuming she\nknew everything she needed to know based on one fact about this person’s life.\nWhat you do isn’t who you are. And people with the same job can be completely\ndi\u0000erent.\n\f\nHere’s another example: I worked with a client who loved traveling and\nwanted someone who had also traveled extensively. I helped her understand that\nadventure and curiosity were the underlying traits that mattered to her, not how\nmany countries he’d been to.\nFast-forward a few months. She met a lovely guy who had never left the\ncountry before because he’d lacked the \u0000nancial means to travel. However, he\nshared those values we’d identi\u0000ed. For him, that had manifested in starting his\nown business. She helped him get his \u0000rst passport. Now they travel together\nconstantly. If she had \u0000ltered only for people with a passport full of stamps—as\nshe’d originally intended—she never would’ve given him a chance.\nJust because you know where people have been or where they are now\ndoesn’t mean you know where they’re going.\nLook for reasons to say yes. It’s tempting to approach dating apps as an\nexercise in discovering what’s wrong with people or \u0000nding a reason to say no.\nInstead, try to be less judgmental. I’ve seen people swipe no when they read\nsomething like “teacher” (“Oh, he won’t make enough money for me”) or “yoga\ninstructor” (“I don’t want to date someone who worships crystals and wants to\nactivate my chakras”). You don’t know these people. You’re seeing a tiny sliver of\nwho they are—a few photos and some basic information. If someone is a maybe,\nswipe right now and see what happens. As you evaluate potential matches, look\nfor what’s attractive about someone rather than what turns you o\u0000.\nDeciphering traits by looking at the apps is more of an art than a science.\nDon’t assume you know what people mean by their answers. Does checking\n“yes” to “occasionally does drugs” mean “I’ll take an edible on a camping trip” or\n“I go on the occasional black-tar heroin binge”? Does checking “Catholic” mean\n“I was raised Catholic but am not actively practicing” or “I’m in the front pew\nevery Sunday”? Don’t presume you know exactly what people meant when they\nanswered the same vague questions you struggled with. Why not meet them and\nexplore these topics in person?\nGo on dates with people whom you don’t necessarily think are a \u0000t. That’s\nthe only way you can ﬁgure out what you actually like rather than assuming you\nalready know."

    "raw_text": "A woman I know posted a rant on Facebook about how “sad and misguided”\nonline daters are these days. As evidence, she posted a picture of a recent pro\u0000le\nshe’d seen. In response to the prompt “My most irrational fear,” he’d written,\n“Marrying someone with a name that isn’t conducive to a wedding hashtag.” She\nfound the answer \u0000ippant and—I’m quoting her Facebook post here—thought\nit represented “the downfall of millennial dating.” (If you’re not familiar with\nwedding hashtags, it’s when the couples combine their names into a punny\nphrase that people use when posting pictures from their wedding. For example,\nwhen my friend Dani married her husband, Eric Helitzer, her hashtag was\n#highwaytohelitzer, a reference to the AC/DC song.)\nI, and many of the people who commented on the post, disagreed. At \u0000rst, I\nresisted the urge to engage, but then I couldn’t not say something. I responded\n“My $.02: I think it’s a mistake to judge someone too harshly for their response\nto a single question on a dating app. I’ve watched many people create their\npro\u0000les and they complete the process as quickly as possible so they can start\nseeing matches right away. Perhaps this answer is a little \u0000ippant for you, but I\nthink it’s funny and tongue-in-cheek. This response suggests to me that he’s\nbeen to enough weddings to roll his eyes at wedding hashtags, so perhaps he’s a\nloyal guy with a big friend group. And if a lot of his pals are married, maybe he’s\nfeeling ready to settle down, too. His answer also suggests he loves puns and\nhopes to marry someone whose name is conducive to a punny hashtag.”\nShe wrote back that she loved puns and was willing to rethink her original\nperspective on the guy. She said she wished she could go back and say yes to him.\nLook, I’m not saying you should swipe yes on almost everyone. Rather, be\nopen to the fact that someone may be far more interesting in person than a\npro\u0000le suggests.\nDon’t Go Out With Too Many People at the Same Time\nAt this point, you might be wondering, Wait, isn’t this the opposite of the advice\nyou just gave me? No. I want you to broaden your \u0000lters to see di\u0000erent kinds of\npeople and go out with some of them. But—and this is a big “but”—I don’t\n\f\nwant you going on tons of dates at the same time. That will only make the\nMonet E\u0000ect worse.\nIt’s easy to keep swiping, swiping, swiping, and setting up dates. If you’re\nfeeling addicted to the apps, it’s not your fault. Really. Many believe Tinder was\nintentionally designed that way. While conducting research for her\ndocumentary, Swiped: Hooking Up in the Digital Age, journalist Nancy Jo Sales\ndiscovered that Tinder was inspired partly by psychology experiments—in\nparticular, those in which famed behaviorist B. F. Skinner conditioned pigeons\ninto thinking that their random pecks would lead to food. “That’s the whole\nswiping mechanism,” Sales said on Kara Swisher’s Recode Decode podcast. “You\nswipe, you might get a match, you might not. And then you’re just, like, excited\nto play the game.” No wonder I spent six hours on Tinder that \u0000rst night. (And\nonce went on 8.5 \u0000rst dates in a week. I’m still trying to \u0000gure out what that half\na date was.)\nChoose not to play the apps like a game. You’ll make better decisions if you\npace yourself and go out with a limited number of people at once. Try to really\nget to know them. If expanding your settings means a bigger menu, then dating\nfewer people at a time means savoring each dish.\nOne of my clients doesn’t go out with more than three people at a time. She\n\u0000nds that’s her perfect number, at which she can give each person a chance to let\nthe relationship grow but also can compare how she’s feeling with each one. If\nyou go overboard and chat with too many people at once, or constantly \u0000ll in\nyour calendar with \u0000rst dates, you are likely to end up like the person who\nsampled from the table with twenty-four jams. You’ll try more jams but won’t\nknow which one to buy. The result? A lonely walk home, a bellyache from all\nthat sugar, and dry toast.\nHOW TO WORK THE APPS SO THEY WORK FOR YOU\nThus far, we’ve talked about how you should assess other people’s pro\u0000les.\nMeanwhile, they’re also evaluating yours. If you’re struggling to get the results\nyou want, here are some evidence-based tips for getting more matches and going\non better dates.\n\f\nSelect Great Photos\nDuh, photos matter. They take up the most real estate on most apps. People will\noften swipe on someone based on a photo alone and scroll down to see more\ninformation only if they like the \u0000rst photo.\nHinge researchers studied which types of photos elicited the most positive\nresponses from its users, which it shared in a 2017 blog post. For this analysis,\nthey randomly selected pro\u0000le photos of a thousand members, tagged them\nbased on their qualities (such as candid versus posed, smiling with or without\nteeth), and evaluated their performance. Here are practical tips based on their\n\u0000ndings:\nDon’t create any guessing games about what you look like or if you’re\nsingle. Pictures that feature \u0000lters or possible signi\u0000cant others received 90\npercent fewer likes than those without. That means no sunglasses and no\npics in which you’re posing with someone people may think you’re dating.\nPotentially worse? A group photo with no clear indication of which\nperson you are. I call these Where’s Waldo? shots. Select at most one group\npic and clearly mark which face is yours.\nWomen see around a 70 percent boost in their chances of getting a like\nsimply by including photos where they’re standing alone, looking away, or\nsmiling with teeth.\nSimilarly, men see a boost in their chances of getting a like by standing\nalone, smiling without teeth, and looking straight toward the camera.\nCandids seriously outperform posed photos. While about 80 percent of\nposted pics are posed, candid shots are 15 percent more likely to receive a\nlike.\nSel\u0000es perform poorly, especially bathroom sel\u0000es, which decrease your\nchance of getting a like by 90 percent. (Pro tip: When meeting new love\n\f\nprospects, try not to associate yourself with the toilet.) Show us that you\nhave a friend who can take a photo of you.\nBlack-and-white photos kill. Despite making up only 3 percent of posted\nphotos, they see a 106 percent boost in likes. Consider going monochrome\nfor your next pic.\nFrom helping my clients set up their pro\u0000les, I’ve found that most people are\npretty bad at selecting their most attractive photos. I’ve developed a system to\nhelp. I ask my clients to send me ten to twenty potential photos. With their\napproval, I put them together in an online album and send them to contacts of\nmine around the country who are unlikely to ever meet my client. Those people\nrank the photos, indicating which pictures they like, which they’d delete, and\nwhich they’d use as the important \u0000rst photo. There’s often a consensus around\nwhich photos work best; it’s almost never the photos my client chose for\nthemselves. Once I see a pattern, I rearrange my client’s photos to re\u0000ect the\nfeedback.\nEXERCISE: Select Better Photos\nCollect ten to twenty photos of yourself (ideally a\ncombination of photos of your face, your full body, and you\ndoing an activity you love, like cooking or hiking) and send\nthem to several friends. Ask which pictures they’d include,\nwhich they’d delete, and which they’d use as the ﬁrst photo.\nOr run your own experiment on the apps: Swap out\ndiﬀerent photos to see which ones lead to the most\nmatches.\nWrite a Thoughtful Proﬁle\n\f\nPresent yourself accurately. I once coached a woman named Abby who\nclaimed she was looking for an outdoorsy guy: She was attracted to\n“lumbersexuals”—hipster guys with beards and plaid shirts. Her photos\nincluded one of her hiking, and her pro\u0000le mentioned an interest in nature. Yet\nthe truth was, she hated spending time in nature. “Abby,” I said to her, “your\nluggage tag literally says, ‘I love not camping.’ This isn’t you. This is who you\nwant to be for the type of guy you think you should be with.” Through our work\ntogether, we crafted a pro\u0000le that was much truer to her personality. We\nincluded artsy photographs of her from a recent trip to Berlin. We wrote about\nher passion for live jazz and overpriced whiskey. While it seems obvious, a good\npro\u0000le should represent you, not an aspirational version of yourself. Being up\nfront about who you are will help save you heartache down the road, like Abby\nhaving to tell her hypothetical lumbersexual boyfriend that she doesn’t want to\njoin him for a \u0000ve-day avalanche training course.\nTo spark conversations be speci\u0000c. The point of a pro\u0000le is to spark\nconversation, not come across as overly clever. Make sure your pro\u0000le creates\nopportunities for people to follow up and connect. Let’s take the Hinge prompt:\n“Qualities I’m looking for in a plus-one wedding date.” If you write, “Someone\nwho’s not married,” that’s funny, but it doesn’t really open the door to\nconversation. Instead, if you put “Knowing all the words to ‘Wannabe’ by the\nSpice Girls,” that could spark a chat around nineties music or who will sing the\nScary Spice part when you do karaoke. If you write, “Someone who will\nchallenge me to a dance-o\u0000,” that’s a great opener for a chat about signature go-\nto moves. The best way to spark conversation is to be speci\u0000c. Include quirky\nthings that make you stand out. If you say, “I like music,” that doesn’t really tell\nme anything about you. Cool, who doesn’t? Same with writing that you like\ntravel, food, and laughter. That’s like saying you like Tom Hanks. Yeah, dude,\nhe’s an American hero. Don’t tell me you like to cook; describe to me your\nsignature dish and what makes your Vietnamese soup pho-nomenal. The more\nspeci\u0000c you are, the more opportunities you give potential matches to connect\nby commenting on that quirk."

I understand the urge, but this sends a negative message. Your vibe\nattracts your tribe. Use the space to attract people who share your actual\nhobbies, not your hobby of complaining.

That’s boring! Good opening lines are (again) speci\u0000c.\nThe goal of an opening line is to get a conversation going so that you can\nmeet up with someone in person. Look at the pro\u0000le and comment on\nsomething subtle, a detail that not everyone would notice. Use a touch of\nhumor. For example, if a man is always looking away from the camera in his\nphotos, you could say, “I see you like pictures where you’re peering o\u0000\nmysteriously into the distance. I’m dying to know what’s out of frame!” Or if\nsomeone’s pro\u0000le mentions a love for the show The Oﬃce, message with your\nfavorite Michael Scott quote. (You can steal my personal favorite: “Make friends\n\u0000rst, make sales second, make love third. In no particular order.”) Show that\nyou’ve put e\u0000ort into your opener.\nAnd for goodness’ sake, send a message when you match with someone! Why\nare you swiping if you’re not going to follow up?\nStay in Touch\nYou have a life to live. Don’t stare at your screen all hours of the day and night.\nEven if you have a super-busy day, try to set aside \u0000fteen minutes to respond to\nmessages, maybe during your commute or when you’re procrastinating at work.\nYou want to keep the momentum going.\nCut to the Chase"

I’ve seen over and over the negative\nconsequences of messaging too much before a date.

When they meet up, the person is inevitably unlike the\nfantasy, which leads to disappointment, even if they would’ve been a good\nmatch otherwise. Great text chemistry doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll vibe in\nperson.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 9\nMEET PEOPLE IRL (IN REAL LIFE)\nHow to Find Love oﬀ the Dating Apps\n“That’s it!” Alicia said, throwing down her backpack and kicking o\u0000 her shoes\nbefore she’d even closed the door to my o\u0000ce. “I’m done with the apps.”\nAfter years of swiping, my client Alicia, a twenty-eight-year-old nursing-\nschool student, was still struggling to \u0000nd her partner. Thousands of swipes had\nturned into very few \u0000rst dates and almost no second ones.\nAlicia is Black. I haven’t referenced the race of my other clients thus far, but I\nneed to mention it here because racism pervades online dating. It makes an\nalready challenging experience that much more painful for Black women.\nChristian Rudder analyzed the behavior of users on OkCupid, the dating site he\ncofounded, on both the company’s blog and in his book, Dataclysm. He\nreported that Black women receive 25 percent fewer \u0000rst messages than women\nof other races. And when Black women reach out to men \u0000rst, they receive\nresponses 25 percent less often than women of other races. Asian men contend\nwith similar behavior. Rudder found that white, Black, and Latina women rate\nAsian men as 30 percent less attractive than they rate men of other races.\nAlicia sank down into my couch. “The apps just aren’t working for me. I\nwant to meet someone in person. Am I the only one who feels like that never\nhappens anymore?” she asked.\nThis was a complaint I heard often from clients, colleagues, and friends.\nPeople my parents’ age shared stories about meeting at a church dance, in line at\na movie theater, or at a park on a lunch break. But now those stories sound\nquaint.\n\f\n“No, you’re not,” I said. “I once asked a client if he would approach a\nstranger in public. He said, ‘And risk being rejected or accused of being creepy?\nNo way.’ Then he pointed to his phone and told me, ‘This is where I meet\npeople now.’ ”\n“At least it’s not just me.”\n“De\u0000nitely not,” I said. “The apps are tough. We’re going to \u0000gure out a way\nfor you to meet someone awesome in person.”\nWhether you’re feeling stuck with the apps or you just want to expand your\nsearch and \u0000sh in an additional pond, here are my four favorite strategies for\nmeeting people IRL (in real life).\n1) Go to events.\nAlicia told me that she often saw events advertised online or heard about them\nthrough friends, but she didn’t know which ones to choose. (Oh, hello there,\nparadox of choice!) Work ate up a lot of her free time, so it felt exhausting—and\nrisky—to get dressed up and go out to an event that could easily end up being a\ndud. Analysis paralysis usually won out. “Why go to a potentially boring event\nwhen I could be bra o\u0000, yoga pants on, by \u0000ve-thirty?” she said.\nI knew events would o\u0000er Alicia the chance to \u0000nd someone. My job was to\nhelp her pick the right ones. I pulled out my notebook and showed her a chart\nI’d designed called the Event Decision Matrix. It helps busy people strategically\nchoose the best events. Every time you hear about a new event, you plot it on the\nmatrix using these two dimensions:\n1. How likely is it that I’ll interact with other people at this event?\n2. How likely is it that I’ll enjoy myself at this event?\nTHE EVENT DECISION MATRIX\nA strategy for meeting people IRL\n\f\nThe vertical axis marks how likely the event is to have person-to-person\ninteraction. In other words, will people attending this event have ample\nopportunities to meet and chat? If you hear about a silent activity with no\ninteraction, like seeing a play, you plot this at the bottom. If you learn of one\nwhere you’re likely to have a conversation—maybe even an extended one—with\nthe majority of people there, you plot it near the top.\nThe horizontal axis represents the likelihood that you’ll enjoy the event.\nEvents that you’re con\u0000dent you’ll love wind up all the way on the right. Events\nthat you know you’ll hate go all the way on the left. Here’s why that matters: An\nevent you’ll enjoy—something that energizes you—is likely to bring out the best\nside of you. You’ll be happier, more relaxed, and more yourself. That’s the\nperfect time to meet someone. In addition, if you go to an event you think you’ll\nenjoy, and you end up not meeting any potential love interests, you’re less likely\nto consider the event a waste of time. You still got to do something you liked,\nright?\nAlicia and I sat down and pulled up a popular event website. (We used\nSF.Funcheap.com, but you can just Google “upcoming events near me.”) As we\nscrolled through upcoming events, we plotted them on the Event Decision\nMatrix.\nA weight-lifting class? Alicia was more of a runner, so she didn’t think she’d\nenjoy it. Plus, grunting side by side isn’t a great way to spark a conversation. We\n\f\nplaced that one in the bottom-left quadrant of the matrix—low likelihood she’d\nenjoy it, low likelihood of interaction.\nFree bike-repair clinic? Probably a pretty chummy activity, but Alicia didn’t\nown a bike, so that one went in the upper-left corner—low likelihood she’d\nenjoy it, high likelihood of interaction.\nA movie screening of Before Midnight? A Richard Linklater classic for sure,\nbut watching a movie with a group doesn’t mean you connect with anyone; the\nonly people talking are on-screen. That one goes in the bottom-right corner—\nhigh likelihood she’d enjoy it, low likelihood of interaction.\nEventually, we discovered a book club discussing Ta-Nehisi Coates, the\naward-winning journalist who writes about culture, politics, and social issues.\nDing-ding-ding. Alicia was a huge fan of his work. And book clubs are all about\ninteraction. She could easily extend the group conversation into a one-on-one\nchat if she met someone she liked. Put that in the upper-right quadrant. Finally!\nAn event with potential.\nBut the Event Decision Matrix wasn’t enough on its own. Alicia needed to\nactually attend the events that fell in the upper-right quadrant. Here’s where I\nput my behavioral science tools to good use.\nResearch from psychology professor Gail Matthews shows that publicly\ncommitting to a goal makes people more likely to accomplish what they set\nout to do. So I asked Alicia, “Do you think you can attend two upper-right-\nquadrant events per month?” She promised to follow through, despite her busy\nwork schedule.\nTHE EVENT DECISION MATRIX\nA strategy for meeting people IRL\n\f\nI gave Alicia a deadline, since deadlines help people take action and avoid the\nnatural tendency to procrastinate: “By this weekend, can you text me the two\nevents you’ve chosen?”\nAlicia started using her matrix right away. Within a month, she went from\ngoing on a few dates a year to meeting six potential partners in one night. The\nevent where she met them? The Ta-Nehisi Coates book club.\nCreate your own: If you’re a busy person who wants to meet people IRL but\nstruggles to decide which events to attend, start plotting your activities on the\nEvent Decision Matrix. If an event falls in that upper-right corner, go to it! As\nyou attend more and more of these, you’ll learn how to quickly recognize events\nthat hit the sweet spot: fun for you and likely to result in quality interactions.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Create Your Own Event Decision Matrix\nEXERCISE: Attend Events\nCommit to attending just one event in the next thirty days.\nI will attend the following event this month:\n_________ _________ _________ _________\nHow to Find Interesting Events\nKeep an eye on Facebook events in your area. Follow the Facebook pages of\norganizations you’re interested in, or sign up for their mailing lists. Look\nthrough Meetup.com for upcoming gatherings that correspond with your\ninterests. Many of these are free. You know those friends who always seem to be\nattending cool events? Ask them to invite you next time, or \u0000nd out where they\ndiscover activities. Look up talks at local universities. Google words like “art"

    "raw_text": "opening” or “\u0000lm festival” along with the name of your city. Churches and\nsynagogues have websites, too! Add the events you \u0000nd to your matrix, and\nfocus on that upper-right quadrant, especially if you have a busy schedule.\nOne client of mine met his girlfriend at a human rights protest. Another\nsigned up for a season as a “free agent” on a volleyball team made up of strangers,\njust to meet new people. She ended up dating the middle blocker, and now they\nplay volleyball together twice a week. My friend met her husband at a meet up\nfor listeners of a podcast they both loved.\nMy friends Jane and Joey met playing Skee-Ball. Joey is a three-time national\nSkee-Ball champion, and Jane attended a Skee-Ball night at a local bar. Now\nthey’re married with an adorable baby, and Jane is the Skee-E-O of their league.\nI love hearing stories about people who meet while volunteering. It’s a great\nway to \u0000nd people who are kind, which you now know is an underrated but\nsupremely important quality in a partner.\nHow to Make the Most of Events\nIt’s not enough to just show up to an event. To meet people, you actually have to\nmeet people.\nIdeally, go alone. You’ll look more approachable, because it’s easier to go up\nto someone who’s alone than to wedge yourself into a group conversation. You\nmay feel that familiar itch to reach for your phone. But seriously—keep it in\nyour pants.\nIf you feel like you really can’t go alone, select the right kind of wingperson:\nsomeone who’s independent, caring, positive, and invested in your success.\nInvite someone who makes you feel comfortable and who knows you’re trying\nto meet new people. Don’t go with anyone who’d feel upset if you spent time\ntalking to someone else.\nAnd your mother really said it best: “You only get one chance to make a \u0000rst\nimpression.” Wear something that makes you feel con\u0000dent. Don’t forget to\n\u0000irt. Make eye contact with the people around you, smile, and then take your\ngaze elsewhere.\n\f\nStart small and commit to meeting at least one new person per event.\nIntroduce yourself. Say something to the people nearby about what’s happening\naround you. You could comment on a painting, the band, their earrings or shoes,\nanything! The point is to practice meeting new people, even if you’re not\nattracted to them. That way, when you meet someone you like, you’ll feel\ncon\u0000dent. (Get those reps in!) In the meantime, making a new friend expands\nyour social circle and increases your chances of meeting a new love interest.\n“But how do I know if the person I talk to is even single?” my clients always\nask me. Well, you don’t! My friend Lucas has an in-your-face way of asking\nwomen if they’re seeing anyone: “Are you in love?” If the woman pauses and\nthen says no, he realizes that she may be casually dating someone but also might\nbe open to going out with him.\nOr you can keep it casual and say something like “Hey, I’d love to keep talking\nabout [insert thing you were discussing]; what’s the best way to connect?” Then\nthe person can give you whatever contact info they’re comfortable sharing, be\nthat their phone number, Instagram handle, or email address. People will usually\nhave a hunch why you’re asking to follow up, and if they have a signi\u0000cant other,\nthey’ll \u0000nd a way to mention that. (If they’re taken or not interested, they may\ndecline to give you their info at all.)\nLadies, don’t worry about making the \u0000rst move. Most men are thrilled to be\napproached by a woman, and if they’re turned o\u0000 by displays of boldness and\ncon\u0000dence, they’re not right for you anyway.\nAnd gentlemen, I know you’re worried about coming o\u0000 as “creepy.” But\ntalking to a stranger at an event is not inherently creepy. Creeps are the ones who\ngo from being charming to, well, creepy—making casual sexual insinuations or\nsexist comments, or continuing to push a conversation when the other person\ngives signs they’re not interested, such as repeatedly looking over their shoulder\nor giving really brief answers. If you’re worried about navigating the line\nbetween “\u0000irty” and “creepy,” stick with “friendly” and let the other person steer\nthe conversation toward something more.\nIf the \u0000rst-move thing is freaking you out, this trick works every time.\nDoesn’t matter whether you need a drink, or whether you have to go to the\nbathroom: Get in a line, any line. People in lines are inherently bored. Even a\n\f\nmomentary distraction—like a conversation with you—is welcome. I tried this\nrecently while boarding a \u0000ight from Atlanta to San Francisco. And let me tell\nyou, my jokes about boarding group E killed.\n2) Get set up by friends and family.\nAccording to research from Stanford, the third most common way for people to\nmeet each other, behind meeting online and at bars/restaurants, is through\nfriends.\nMany of my clients would love to be set up, but they’ve told me this rarely\nhappens to them.\nTo \u0000nd out why, I asked a group of both single and partnered people why\nthey don’t set up their friends more. They had a range of answers. Some said it\njust doesn’t cross their mind; or they assume if their friends wanted help, they’d\nask for it. Others said they respected their friends’ privacy and didn’t want to\ninterfere. Some worried their friends would be insulted if they were set up with a\nperson they felt wasn’t good enough for them.\nBut there’s hope! Despite their hesitations, everyone I spoke to said they\nwanted to help. Take advantage of this instinct. Your friends are great resources\nbecause they both know you well and know people you don’t.\nHere are some ways you can get more people to set you up on dates:\nAsk people to set you up. I know it seems simple, but many people fail to\nask their friends for help. Reach out to friends and say, “I am ready to \u0000nd\nsomeone. Will you introduce me to some single people you know?”\nTell them what you’re looking for, and think of the Life Partner,\nnot the Prom Date. For example, “I’m into people who are intellectual,\nartsy, and care about social justice” or “I’m looking for someone who’s\nkind, thoughtful, and loves food. They’re in good shape but aren’t overly\nobsessed with working out.” They may think of someone right away or\nstay on the lookout when they meet new people.\n\f\nSend your friend some photos. Choose \u0000attering (but realistic!) pictures\nthey can send along to potential matches.\nSay yes to dates. Seriously. If someone goes to the e\u0000ort of trying to set\nyou up on a date, say yes! Presumably, this is a friend and not someone\ntrying to waste your time. What do you have to lose? A night? Some cash?\nJust do it. My friend Steph tells her friends, “If you think I’d like someone,\nI am willing to go out with them at least once.” Because of that promise,\nI’m more likely to set her up, unlike some friends of mine who haven’t\nfollowed up on introductions I’ve given them. I once had a friend who\nbegged me to set her up on a date. I sent her a photo of the guy and told\nher about him and vice versa. They both agreed to the setup, but when he\ntexted her, she never responded. She subjected this guy to unnecessary\nrejection. I vowed never to set her up again.\nGive your friends feedback. If the date goes well, send them a thank-you\ntext. Or better yet, \u0000owers! If it wasn’t a good match, thank them for the\nintroduction and let them know what worked and what didn’t. (Choose\nyour words carefully in case this is a close friend of theirs.) This feedback\ngets them closer to understanding what you want; motivates them, since\nfeedback is encouraging; and provides a chance for them to let you know if\nyou’re being too picky. They might hear your reasons and encourage you\nto give the person another chance. Listen to them.\nO\u0000er incentives! This might sound ridiculous, but it works. A former\ncoworker told me she was o\u0000ering a big chunk of change to anyone who\nintroduced her to the man she’d marry. When I heard how much she was\nwilling to pay—several thousand dollars—I was impressed. First, it showed\nme she realized how much \u0000nding your life partner was really worth.\nSecond, while I liked this coworker (she’s fun, enthusiastic, warm, and\ncaring), I probably wouldn’t have taken the time to think about setting her\nup with someone if not for the incentive. Suddenly, when I met eligible\nmen, I immediately asked myself whether they might hit it o\u0000 with her.\n\f\nAnother friend’s dad sends a generous order from Nuts.com to anyone\nwho sets his daughter up on \u0000ve dates (either \u0000ve di\u0000erent guys or\nmultiple dates with the same person). In the last year, I’ve received three\npackages. A few months ago, Scott set her up with one of his friends,\nwhom we think she’ll marry. We can’t wait for our lifetime supply of\npremium nuts.\n\f\nPAY IT FORWARD. HOW TO SET UP OTHER PEOPLE:\n1. Scan your phone contacts or Facebook friends to remind\nyourself who’s single. What about that great girl you used to\nwork with? She had such a positive attitude and loved trying\nnew things. Didn’t she and her girlfriend break up recently?\n2. Once you’ve thought of a match, contact the person you\nthink is pickier or the person you know better. “Hey! I think I\nmight have a friend who would be a good romantic match for\nyou. Here’s a picture of him. He’s really thoughtful, brilliant,\nand fun-loving. Would you be open to me setting you two up?”\nA couple things to watch out for: You don’t want to give too\nmuch information and overwhelm the person; nor should you\nprovide too little information and risk triggering the Monet\nEﬀect. Just give enough so that your friend is intrigued.\n3. If the presumed-to-be-pickier person says yes, ask the other\nperson if they’re interested, using a similar text.\n4. If the second person says no, let the ﬁrst person know, gently.\nYou can say something like: “Turns out he’s not looking to date\nright now. I think he just met someone.” Be compassionate. It’s\na tough world out there.\n5. If both people say yes, connect them via group text or email.\nKeep it short. I try to say something fun or quirky. Sometimes\nI even suggest a date idea. Here are real messages I’ve sent:\n“Adam > Molly. Get back to me when you’ve come up with ten\nnew ways to go down a slide.” “Craig, Tara. Tara, Craig. Hope\nyou two can meet up soon. May I suggest a walk through\nGolden Gate Park where you try to pet at least ﬁve dogs?”\nThey don’t need to follow this exact plan. My goal is to give\nthem a silly way to connect.\n6. Give them space. Allow the couple to go out without\nmicromanaging them. Encourage them to start talking oﬀ the\ngroup thread. Once they’ve gone out, you can ask for feedback\n\f\nin order to get a better sense of what they’re looking for, but\nagain, be sensitive. It’s up to them how much to share.\n7. Host parties! My friend Georgina, who’s responsible for\nseveral long-term relationships and dozens more friend\ngroups, hosts a monthly brunch called the Big Gay Brunch.\nShe reduces the pressure of trying to be a perfect matchmaker\nby making it a friendly event. People come hoping to meet new\npeople, whether it’s romantic or platonic. She doesn’t have to\nﬁgure out who will like whom; she just puts her wonderful\nfriends in the same place at the same time and lets them take\nit from there.\n3) Connect with people you already know.\nSometimes your person is hiding in plain sight. This might be a friend, a friend\nof a friend, someone on your church committee or in your running club. All you\nhave to do is see this person in a di\u0000erent light. That’s what happened to me! By\nthe time Scott and I started dating, we’d been Facebook friends for eight years\nand real friends for one. I was able to see him with fresh eyes, thanks to the\nperspective I gained from working with a dating coach. (Yes, I’m proof that this\nstu\u0000 really works.)\nAll the time, people tell me how they fell for a colleague they’d known for\nmany months or a friend they’d been hanging out with for years. One of my\nclients, whom I’d been working with for months, \u0000nally ended up settling down\nwith a woman he’d known for years. He reached out to her for help preparing\nfor a job interview, and the twenty-minute meeting stretched into a four-hour\nconversation, sprawling from their favorite sports teams to the recent death of\nhis father. He realized that this woman he’d counted as a friend for so long could\nbe much more to him.\nTake a look at your friend group and see if there’s someone who’s single and\nwith whom you share a lot of “friendistry”—a word I just made up that means\n“friend chemistry.” Is there someone whom you love spending time with, whom\n\f\nyou trust, whom you might feel an inkling of attraction to? Come on, tell me.\nWho just popped in your mind?\nBefore you start blowing up their phone, understand that the stakes are high.\nYou don’t want to make someone uncomfortable or negatively a\u0000ect the\ndynamics of a friend group. The thought of making a move on a friend probably\n\u0000lls you with anxiety. That anxiety is telling you to proceed with caution.\nIf you go down this path, respect this person’s boundaries. I’m not\nencouraging you to get drunk with your friend and make a move. How about\ngrabbing beers and saying something coy, like “Have you ever considered if we\ncould be more than friends?” or “Crazy thought: I wonder what we’d be like as a\nmarried couple.” If they’re interested, they’ll follow you down this\nconversational path and tell you what you need to know. Or they may not see\nyou that way. Regardless, it’s worth bringing up. If they’re not interested, what’s\nthe worst that could happen? Make a joke and move on.\n4) Introduce yourself to people when you’re out and about.\nImagine you’re commuting to work by yourself. As you get on the train, you\nhave two options: Sit in a quiet car or one where people are encouraged to talk to\neach other. Quiet car all the way, right? Who wants to be trapped in a\nconversation with a stranger about their eleven foster cats or their missing toe?\nBehavioral scientists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder observed the same\npreference in their paper “Mistakenly Seeking Solitude.” When they asked a\ngroup of commuters whether they’d like to interact with a stranger on the train\nor sit alone without speaking to anyone, most people chose the silent option.\nThen they ran an experiment to see which experience commuters actually\nenjoyed more. They randomly assigned commuters on a public transit train in\nChicago to either talk to the person sitting next to them, “remain disconnected,\nor to commute as normal.” They found that those who engaged with the\nstranger had the most positive experience on the train, and those who sat alone\nwith their thoughts had the least positive experience. They replicated the results\nin an experiment on Chicago buses.\n\f\nOur instinct to avoid conversations with strangers is wrong. We only think we\nwant solitude. We underestimate how much joy social connection can bring.\nOpen your eyes and look around. Say hi to a stranger! But don’t take this as\nblanket advice to harass strangers in public. Test the waters. When you approach\nsomeone, see if they are open to chatting by commenting on something around\nyou or asking a question. If they’re not picking up what you’re putting down,\nleave them alone. (Please don’t get maced! That’s bad publicity for me.) But\nyou’ll probably be surprised—in a good way—by what happens when you smile\nat a fellow traveler or start a conversation with someone who elbowed to the\nfront of the same concert as you. The world is full of great potential matches, or\npeople who know great potential matches.\nScott’s parents met on the subway in New York. His future mom was holding\na book from her psychology PhD program. His future dad recognized the title\nand said, “Oh, you’re reading developmental psychology?” That comment kick-\nstarted a ful\u0000lling marriage of thirty-\u0000ve years and counting.\nWhen I heard their “how we met” story, my initial thought was: This\nwouldn’t happen today, because they would’ve been wearing headphones. Let this\nbe a reminder to leave your electronics in your pocket when you’re traveling\nthrough the world. Nothing screams, “Don’t talk to me!” more than a giant pair\nof over-the-ear headphones.\nOne of my clients met his girlfriend in an airport lounge. They were both\ntraveling a ton for work. He pointed out they had the same unusual heavy-duty\ncarry-on luggage. Soon they started meeting up at di\u0000erent airports across the\nUnited States for dates.\nDating apps are still good for meeting a lot of people. You might even really\nlike a few of those people! But don’t underestimate the fun of meeting people\nIRL.\nAlicia dated a guy from the Ta-Nehisi Coates book club for a few months.\nAfter she recovered from the breakup, she continued using the Event Decision\nMatrix to meet more potential matches. She’s currently dating someone she met\nat her ten-year college reunion, an event she says she would’ve skipped if it\nhadn’t landed in the upper-right quadrant of the matrix.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. While apps are the most common way people meet one\nanother these days, you can still strategize ways to meet\npeople IRL (in real life).\n2. Go to events. Use the Event Decision Matrix to ﬁgure out the\nmost promising ones to attend, based on how likely you are\nto enjoy the activity and how likely you are to interact with\nother people.\n3. Get your friends and family to set you up on dates by letting\nthem know this is something you’re interested in, making the\nprocess easy for them, saying yes to dates, and giving\nfeedback (and gratitude). You can even offer incentives.\n4. Connect with people you already know. Your person may be\nhidden in plain sight. All you have to do is change your frame\nof mind.\n5. Introduce yourself to people when you’re out and above.\nImprove your chances by taking off your headphones and\ninteracting with the world around you. If you’re at an event\nand you don’t know what to say, get in a line and start\ncommenting on it! People in lines love to discuss lines."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 10\nTHIS IS A DATE, NOT A JOB\nINTERVIEW\nHow to Create Better Dates\nJonathan made a lot of progress in our \u0000rst two months working together. He\nstarted saying yes to dates with di\u0000erent types of people, people he would’ve\nrejected in the past.\nOne afternoon, he called me to report on his latest date: “He’s great.\nPassionate, brilliant, we share the same values. He has great taste in books. He\nloves his work.” Jonathan paused. “But it’s not a \u0000t.”\n“What?” I said, confused.\n“I just didn’t feel the spark.”\n“Oh, that’s too bad,” I said, deciding not to launch into a tirade against the\ndangerous myth of “the spark.” (I do that in the next chapter.) “What did you\ndo together?”\n“I’m really busy with work travel and a million meetings, so he met me at the\nco\u0000ee shop under my o\u0000ce before work.”\n“What time?”\n“Seven a.m.”\n“How long?”\n“About twenty minutes.”\n“I see. And how were you feeling at that time?”\n“To be honest, I was stressed. I was scheduled to meet with a big investor at\neight a.m., so I was pretty worried about that.”\n“And do you usually feel good in the mornings?”\n\f\n“No, I hate the mornings. I’m a night owl. I’m a wreck until I grab my co\u0000ee\nbefore work.”\n“Hmm.” I took a deep breath. I wanted Jonathan to see the situation from\nmy perspective. “So, you’re not a morning person, you’re not awake until you\nhave ca\u0000eine, you were distracted by an important work meeting, and yet you\ndecided to meet with him for twenty minutes at seven a.m. for a co\u0000ee date?”\n“Yep, and no spark.”\nJonathan was trying. He really was! He was busy, and yet he made the e\u0000ort\nto date when and where he could. But there’s more to dating than simply\nmaking time for it.\nENVIRONMENT MATTERS\nRemember the story of those Google employees who cut back on their M&M’s\nconsumption? They ate less candy once it moved from glass jars to opaque\ncontainers.\nThat example demonstrates one of the most important lessons of behavioral\nscience: The environment in which we make our choices matters.\nJonathan left that seven a.m. date thinking there just wasn’t a spark between\nthem. That there was no romantic potential. That his date wasn’t the right guy.\nBut perhaps they’d merely met in the wrong context?\nWhen we go on dates, we’re impacted by more than just the physical location\nof where we meet. The environment of a date is also when we meet, what we do,\nand the mindset we bring to it. When we \u0000rst started working together,\nJonathan treated dating as if it were an item on his to-do list, an activity to\nsqueeze in between going to the gym and picking up his dry cleaning. He was\nbringing a harried, sexless mindset into dating and was then surprised when he\nfelt no attraction to the other person. He’s not the only one. Many of my clients,\ndesperate to \u0000nd love but also busy with other commitments, have managed to\ndrain all the \u0000irtation and fun out of the experience of dating. Instead, they tend\nto engage in what I call evaluative dating (or “evaludating,” if you want to be\ncute about it)."

    "raw_text": "And evaluative dating isn’t merely unpleasant; it’s also a terribly ine\u0000cient\nway to \u0000nd a long-term partner. In this chapter, I’ll teach you how to shift your\ndating mindset from evaluative to experiential. From reviewing résumé\nqualities and asking, Is this person good enough for me? Do we have enough in\ncommon? to getting out of your own head and into the moment; to asking\nyourself, How do I feel with this person? To paying attention to what unfolds\nwhen you’re together. To dating with an attitude of curiosity. To allowing\nyourself to be surprised.\nI’ll also explain how to create the right physical and mental dating\nenvironment to give yourself the best shot at \u0000nding love.\nIS IT A DATE OR A JOB INTERVIEW?\nImagine yourself in the following situation: You enter the room apprehensively,\nworried what your evaluator will think of you. You’re dressed nicely but a bit\nuncomfortably. You hope you’re not sweating. (Damn it. You’re deﬁnitely\nsweating. Back of the knees and underarms.)\nYou walk over to the table, put your bag down on the \u0000oor, shake hands, and\nslide into the seat across from them.\nWould you like something to drink?\nYou mumble something about iced tea, no sugar. (Was that a test? What does\niced tea say about me?)\nThe iced tea arrives.\nThe interview begins.\nWhere did you go to school?\nWhat did you study? Why?\nWhat’s the biggest risk you’ve ever taken?\nWhat’s your ﬁve-year plan?\nThe evaluator invites you to ask her some questions.\nWithin forty-\u0000ve minutes, the evaluation is over.\nYou stand up. You shake hands. You put on a friendly smile. I look forward to\nspeaking again soon! You leave.\n\f\nSo tell me: Was this a date or a job interview? Instead of imagining it in a\nconference room, what if it’s at a wine bar? The setting might change, but the\nvibe is basically the same. I’m sure you’ve been on sterile dates like this one. I\nhear this from my friends and clients all the time: “Dating isn’t fun anymore. It\nfeels like work.” Look, I get it, and in a way, dating is work. Dating well requires\ntime and e\u0000ort, and it’s not always enjoyable. It sucks to get rejected or \u0000nd\nyourself let down yet again. If dating weren’t the only way to \u0000nd a long-term\npartner, how many of us would have given up on it years ago? But just because\ndating requires work doesn’t mean it has to mimic what you do at work. This is\nnot a networking meeting or a job interview. You should not conduct yourself\nthe same way you do at work.\nThis type of date quells any sexuality that might enter the equation. Even\nworse, dates that are structured like job interviews put us into “press play”\nmode. That’s how behavioral scientist Kristen Berman describes what happens\nwhen we’re prompted to repeat canned responses like a robot. We launch into a\nstory we’ve already told half a dozen times—likely on other dates—and start\nrattling o\u0000 our résumé. In these moments, we’re just spewing out information,\nnot connecting with the other person.\nEsther Perel characterizes the anemic state of modern dating this way:\n“People sit there, check their pulse, and they try to see if they’re having some\nkind of physiological reaction—a sense of the spark. In this frozen situation,\nwhere they’re interviewing each other, they want that moment to have a blip.\nAre you out of your freaking mind?” If you sit through a date trying to evaluate\nthe other person and your own reaction, you’re not present. Your date can’t get\na good sense of who you are, and you aren’t present enough to experience the\nmoment, let alone enjoy it.\nThe point of the \u0000rst date isn’t to decide if you want to marry someone or\nnot. It’s to see if you’re curious about the person, if there’s something about\nthem that makes you feel like you would enjoy spending more time together.\nTEN STEPS TO DESIGNING BETTER DATES\n\f\nYou can design better dates—dates that don’t feel like job interviews—by\nshifting your mindset and selecting more intentional activities. Here’s how to\nmake dating fun again:\n1) Shift your mindset with a pre-date ritual.\nYour mindset doesn’t just set the mood for your date—it can also determine the\noutcome. Richard Wiseman, a researcher from the University of Hertfordshire\nin the UK, wanted to \u0000nd out how strongly our mindset a\u0000ects our experiences.\nHe recruited groups of people who thought of themselves as particularly lucky\nor unlucky. Wiseman gathered these people together and invited them to\nparticipate in an experiment. He handed out newspapers and asked everyone to\ncount the number of photographs inside.\nThe self-described “luckies” took just a few seconds to correctly count the\nnumber of photographs. The “unluckies” took around two minutes. How did\nthe luckies do it so quickly? On the second page of the newspaper, in large type\nthat took up half the page, there was a “secret” message: “Stop counting. There\nare 43 photographs in this newspaper.” The luckies saw this clue, wrote down\nthe correct answer, and completed the task. The unlucky folks were so busy\nmeticulously counting the photographs that they failed to see the hint.\nWiseman didn’t stop there. He included another message, halfway through\nthe paper, that said: “Stop counting. Tell the experimenter you have seen this\nand win £250.” Sadly, most of the unlucky folks missed this one, too.\nWhy did the lucky folks spot the \u0000rst sign when the unlucky participants\nmissed both clues? It all has to do with the way these two groups of people\ninteract with the world. Lucky people expect good things to happen. They are\nopen to opportunities and recognize them when they appear. When they looked\nthrough the newspaper, they weren’t just looking at the photographs with\nblinders on; they saw the hint on the second page.\nPeople who saw themselves as unlucky tensed up—because they expected the\nworst—and their anxiety prevented them from noticing unexpected\nopportunities. A lucky break was staring them in the face in a big bold font, but\n\f\nthey couldn’t see it because of their negative outlook. Their mindset became a\nself-ful\u0000lling prophecy.\nI’ve found “unlucky daters” behave similarly. They feel burned out after years\nof dating and bring that negative energy into every date. This causes them to\nmiss great opportunities. There’s an old Henry Ford quote that goes, “Whether\nyou believe you can do a thing or not, you are right.” Here’s my version:\nWhether you believe the date will go well or poorly, you are right. You’re self-\nsabotaging if your pre-date mantra sounds something like: “Obviously, this isn’t\ngoing to work. It hasn’t worked the last hundred dates.” You have negative-\nmindset blinders on! You’re adopting the mindset of an “unlucky” who misses\nlife’s clues—in this case, the signs of a potential match.\nFortunately, we can change our mindset. Wiseman created a program called\nthe “luck school,” where he taught unlucky and lucky volunteers to think like a\nlucky person. He focused on four things: listening to their intuition; expecting\nto be lucky; spotting chance opportunities; and rebounding more quickly when\nbad things happen. Assignments ranged from keeping a diary of lucky\noccurrences, to “visualizing good fortune,” to verbally declaring their intentions:\n“I am willing to put time and e\u0000ort into changing my luck.” After a month, 80\npercent of the luck school’s “graduating class” felt happier, more satis\u0000ed with\ntheir lives, and most important, luckier.\nI want you to put yourself through your own version of luck school, shifting\nyour mindset to expect great dates. To help you do this, design a pre-date\nritual. This is something you’ll do before every date to get you in the right\nheadspace.\nHere are some pre-date rituals from my clients:\n“I always plan ahead. I turn o\u0000 my work noti\u0000cations. I try to block o\u0000 at\nleast thirty minutes before starting my date. I usually call one of my closest\nfriends, someone who makes me feel con\u0000dent and loved.”\n“I like to listen to comedy before a date. My favorite podcast is called Good\nOne. On every episode, comedians share one of their all-time favorite jokes\n\f\nand then analyze it with the host. It makes me laugh and puts me in a good\nmood.”\n“I do jumping jacks to get my heart pumping. It releases endorphins and\nputs me in a good mood.”\n“I feel so unsexy when I leave work. Baths before a date work wonders. I\nuse a bubble bath with a great smell. I’ve found scent is a powerful\naphrodisiac. Then I apply lotion to my body. It helps me turn my work\nbrain oﬀ and turn myself on!”\nEXERCISE: Shift Your Mindset with a Pre-Date Ritual\nList two pre-date rituals you want to try before future\ndates:\n1. \n2. \nCommit to trying diﬀerent pre-date activities until you ﬁnd\none that works for you.\n2) Choose the time and place of the date thoughtfully.\nTime and place matter. When do you tend to feel most relaxed and like yourself?\nPlan your dates in those time slots. No seven a.m. dates, please.\nStop going on dates in well-lit co\u0000ee bars. If you’re thinking: If this date sucks,\nat least I got some caﬀeine out of it. Don’t. You don’t want your dates to feel like a\nnetworking meeting. Choose something sexier, like a candlelit wine bar.\nAnd try sitting next to—rather than across from—your date. Have you ever\nopened up to someone on a long drive? Or noticed that it feels easier to talk to a\n\f\nfriend while walking side by side, when you’re not making direct eye contact?\nThat’s because it’s easier to talk when we’re not looking someone in the eyes.\nPsychologists Shogo Kajimura and Michio Nomura at Kyoto University in\nJapan explored this phenomenon in a 2016 study. When participants stared into\nthe eyes of a face on a screen looking at them (as opposed to one looking o\u0000 to\nthe side), they struggled to complete a simple word-matching game. Kajimura\nand Nomura attributed that di\u0000culty to biology: Eye contact and processing\nlanguage rely on the same neural circuitry. You can use this insight to your\nadvantage on dates. Why not suggest going for a walk? This will help the date\nfeel less like a job interview, protect your brain from overloading, and promote\nconnection.\n3) Opt for a creative activity.\nLook for a fun activity you can do with your date. Dan Ariely and a team of\nHarvard Business School researchers ran an experiment where they sent couples\non virtual dates in an online setting designed to look like an art gallery. They\nhoped this setting would spark conversation, and it did. Participants chatted\nabout the artwork and discovered common interests. The art functioned as a\n“third object,” something both people could comment on. A third object takes\nthe pressure o\u0000. It makes awkward silence a bit less awkward.\nIf Renaissance paintings of the Virgin Mary or modern art sculptures of\nspiders aren’t your thing, don’t worry. It’s not about the art. Third objects can\ninclude books, games, and even other people. I recommend going on dates\nwhere you can watch your companion interact with others. This is a great way to\nget a sense of those hard-to-measure qualities that are so important, like\nkindness. Perhaps that means taking a cocktail-making class in a small group. Is\nyour date rude to the instructor? Patient while gathering the ingredients?\nHelpful to the woman who showed up late? Or you could suggest a date that\nforces you to collaborate, like working on a puzzle or visiting a Korean BBQ\nplace where you have to cook your own meal. How well do you work as a team?\nYou might even consider eating something messy, like dumplings dipped in\nsauce. Who can put up a front when they have soy sauce dripping down their\n\f\nchin? In any of these scenarios, you’re gathering a lot more data than by talking\none-on-one at seven a.m. in a co\u0000ee shop.\nYou can \u0000nd a whole list of creative date ideas on my website (loganury.com).\nHere are some outside-the-box dates that my clients and I have come up\nwith:\nVisit a farmers’ market and then cook brunch.\nGo roller-skating.\nCreate a two-person hot-sauce-tasting contest.\nWatch YouTube to learn a dance from a favorite childhood music video.\nDo karaoke.\nSee an old movie and then discuss it over a walk.\nTake a cooking class.\nGo for a bike ride and bring a picnic.\nTry swing dancing.\nCheck out the stars at the local observatory.\nRent scooters and explore the city. (Bring helmets!)\nPlay games at a local arcade. (Bring quarters!)\nBring watercolors to the park and paint pictures of the same tree (or each\nother!).\nYou might even enjoy stealing this idea for a “day of yes” from a friend of\nmine. She explained: “We went on a date in which we took turns suggesting our\n\f\nnext move and the other person had to say yes (unless illegal or against their\nvalues). We met at the Brooklyn Heights ferry stop, where we said yes to getting\non the ferry and the next person had to suggest where to get o\u0000, to which the\nother needed to say yes. We kept exchanging ideas of things to do, and it was an\namazing date. We ended up exploring a new neighborhood together, eating a\nsingle plate at multiple Polish restaurants, and getting in some pretty deep\nconversation.”\nAll right, admit it. Did you read that list and say, “Yeah, sure, cool ideas, but\nthat’s way too out there for me. Who has time for that?” I understand these\ndates feel far more intense than a regular ol’ drinks or co\u0000ee date. But your goal\nhere isn’t to make things as comfortable as possible. It’s to \u0000nd a great person to\nbuild a relationship with. Going on dates like these is going to help you get\nthere. Take a chance and suggest one of these activities. You don’t have to\ncommit to a whole day of hide-and-seek, just choose something di\u0000erent! The\nworst thing that will happen is the person will decline your o\u0000er and insist on\nsomething more traditional. That’s \u0000ne, too. But a far more likely result is that\nyour date is sick of those “job interview” dates, too, and will welcome the chance\nto try something new.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Try Some Out-of-the-Box Activities\nTake time now to think of some fun date activities. Don’t be\nafraid to get a little zany.\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n4) Show your work.\nResearch from Harvard Business School professors Ryan Buell and Michael\nNorton found that people value something more when they see all the e\u0000ort that\nwent into it.\nImagine if you were searching online for a \u0000ight. The quicker the results\nappear, the better, right? Maybe not. Norton ran an experiment where he had\nparticipants search for \u0000ights on a fake travel search engine. Participants were\nassigned to di\u0000erent experiment groups. For some, the program showed them\nimmediate results. For others, the software took its time returning the results,\nwith a progress bar that increased over time and a message about how it was\nsearching for \u0000ights on this airline, and then this airline, and then that airline.\nSurprisingly, those in the second condition valued the system more. Even though\nit produced results more slowly, they felt the program was working harder on\ntheir behalf. They valued the eﬀort of the program over the speed.\nThis is why Domino’s Pizza lets you follow along as your pizza is “\u0000red up,”\n“in the oven,” and “double-checked for perfection.” We all know how pizza"

    "raw_text": "delivery works. But when you see e\u0000ort, you appreciate value.\nWe can apply the same lessons to planning dates. Act more like that second\ntravel search engine by letting your date know about the things you’ve done to\nmake the experience special. It’s not about bragging or exaggerating; it’s about\nmaking your e\u0000orts apparent so your date can appreciate them more.\nOne great way to show your e\u0000ort is to o\u0000er to plan the date, or to choose a\nplace near the other person’s home or work. I’ve found that my clients who live\nin big cities like New York or Los Angeles often get trapped in a back-and-forth\nover whose neighborhood they’ll meet in. You can show e\u0000ort by making the\ndate convenient for the other person. Message them something like: “Hey, what\narea do you live in? I can plan something near there.” During the date, mention\nthe thought that you put into particular decisions. Say: “I chose this Peruvian\nplace because you wrote on your pro\u0000le that it was your dream to visit Machu\nPicchu.” People will appreciate the e\u0000ort, and your thoughtfulness will help you\nstand out.\n5) Play.\nThink back to the best date you’ve ever had. Perhaps you met up at a tequila bar,\nate perfectly cooked carnitas tacos, and sipped spicy margarita after spicy\nmargarita, whispering increasingly \u0000irty things in each other’s ears, until it felt\nlike you were the only people there, which, eventually, you were? Or did you go\nfor a late-night walk, confess your fears about your fraught relationship with\nyour brother, and then have him kiss away your tears, which transitioned to a\nfull-on make-out, pressed up against your door?\nWhat made your best date so great? Probably not the fact that your\ncompanion satis\u0000ed eight of your top ten criteria for a partner. You probably\nhad fun! And yet fun is rarely something we build into our dates.\nEnough with these robotic “press play” dates. Let’s make your dates about\nplay.\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the word “play”? Little kids running\naround a playground? Maybe you think dating is serious—you want to \u0000nd a\npartner yesterday—and you simply don’t have time to play around.\n\f\nBut play isn’t just for kids at recess. And playing isn’t the same as playing\ngames. In fact, it’s the opposite. Playing games involves deceit and misdirection.\nIt’s a waste of time, because your love interest will discover at some point who\nyou really are, and then what? Play, on the other hand, involves being a present,\nhonest version of yourself—just a little lighter.\nIn an article in the New York Times called “Taking Playtime Seriously,”\nCatherine Tamis-LeMonda, a professor of psychology at New York University,\nexplained it this way: “Play is not a speci\u0000c activity, it’s an approach to learning,\nan engaged, fun, curious way of discovering your world.” Play is intrinsically\nmotivated—that means it’s for its own sake, rather than achieving a goal.\nLet’s say you’re on a date in the park. You might play by looking around and\ncoming up with backstories for the people nearby. You could use these\nimprovisational backstories to start analyzing which couples you think will last\nand which will break up—and why. Or you could run around and see how many\ndogs you can pet in \u0000fteen minutes.\nI understand this approach can feel a bit forced at \u0000rst. Instead of pretending\nthis is how you usually behave, try being self-deprecating about it: “Hey, this\nmight sound a little strange, but what if we tried…” You’ll get points for\ncreativity even if the person declines to participate.\nHave fun. Be silly. Make a joke. Humor is a great tool to create a sense of play.\nWhen we laugh, our brains release a happy cocktail of hormones, changing our\npsychology. Laughing releases oxytocin—the same bonding hormone released\nduring breast-feeding—and makes us trust the other person more. (And if it’s\noxytocin we’re after, laughing is a more socially appropriate activity on a \u0000rst\ndate than breast-feeding.) Laughter lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol,\nallowing us to relax. Laughter also creates a dopamine hit, activating our brain’s\npleasure centers. It reinforces our behavior and makes us want to go back for\nmore. All good things for a \u0000rst date: more bonding, less stress, and an improved\nchance of a second date.\n6) Skip the small talk.\n\f\nWe form stronger connections with each other when we ask questions.\nQuestions allow people to reveal personal details about themselves, which is\nessential for forming close bonds. What’s more, research from psychologist\nKaren Huang shows that being inquisitive tends to increase how much others\nlike you.\nThe kind of questions you ask matter. Who cares what this person studied in\ncollege? Remember, this is a date, not an interview. Despite all the reasons to go\ndeep, many of us spend our dates in the shallow end of the pool.\nIn the viral New York Times Modern Love column titled “To Fall in Love\nwith Anyone, Do This,” Mandy Len Catron highlights the power of thought-\nprovoking questions. On a date, Catron and her companion answered thirty-six\nquestions, which escalated in intensity and intimacy from “Given the choice of\nanyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?” to “If you were\nto die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what\nwould you most regret not having told someone?”\nThese weren’t just random questions Catron had scribbled down on an index\ncard on the way over. (Note: Never bring index cards on dates.) They were\ndesigned by psychologist Arthur Aron and his colleagues for an experiment in\nwhich they paired random strangers to ask each other a series of thirty-six\nquestions. They tested the power of “sustained, escalating, reciprocal,\npersonalistic self-disclosure.” Aron and his team—and later Catron, who is still\nwith the guy from that fateful date—found that these particular questions help\npotential partners bond by building connection and promoting vulnerability.\nIf you don’t feel like asking these kinds of questions, try my favorite approach\nto avoiding small talk. Enter the date in media res. That’s Latin for “in the\nmiddle of things.” It’s a literary term that describes a story opening somewhere\nin the middle of the action, rather than at the beginning. (You can think of it as\n“coming in hot.”) When you walk into a date, instead of starting with the\nawkward “So, how’s your day going?” or “Where do you live?” jump right into\nthe middle of things: “You’ll never guess what happened on my way over here!”\nor “I just got o\u0000 the phone with my sister, and she told me about this battle she’s\nin with her landlord over the recycling bins.” By skipping the getting-to-know-\nyou small talk and diving straight into the type of conversation that friends (or"

    "raw_text": "lovers!) might have, you take a shortcut to intimacy. Of course the conversation\nmay reverse—you’ll eventually cover how your day is going, where you live, and\nso on, but at least you will have dipped your toes into the waters of real\nconversation.\nAnother great approach is soliciting advice. You can ask about a real thing\nthat’s going on in your life. “My sister’s getting married in a few weeks, and I\ndon’t know if I should give a roast or a toast. Have you ever given a speech at a\nwedding?” Or: “My boss sends me emails all weekend, and I don’t know how to\nset boundaries with him. What would you do?”\nRemember, asking questions is only half the equation. You need to actually\nlisten to the answers, too. This allows you to see how the person thinks. Does\ntheir advice resonate with you? Are they comfortable sharing? And when you\nrespond, do you feel heard?\n7) Be interested, not interesting.\nI once worked with a client named Andrea. She was charismatic, with long red\nhair and a big toothy smile. She performed improv on the weekends and would\noften make me howl with her tales of \u0000rst dates gone wrong.\n“Logan, I’m trying,” she said, crossing her arms over her chest. “I just don’t\nfeel a connection with these people.”\n“Are you practicing your pre-date ritual?”\n“Yes,” she said, rolling her eyes.\n“Are you planning creative dates?”\n“You know I just went to that art class with that guy last week.”\n“Are you doing small talk?”\n“I hate small talk.”\nI was struggling to see what was going wrong, so I asked Andrea to go out\nwith a guy friend of mine to gather more information. He called me\nimmediately afterward.\n“How was it?” I asked. “Well, she talked over me the whole time, and she\nspent most of the date monologuing about some work drama. Oh, and she\ninsisted on ordering for me.”\n\f\nA few days later, Andrea came over again. I told her what he’d said.\n“I’m so embarrassed,” she said. She was silent for a minute and then surprised\nme by grinning—as if the negative feedback had made her happy.\nTurns out it had. “Wait, so it’s me!” she said. “It’s not something wrong with\nall the men in this city. It’s something I can change.”\nLike Andrea, a lot of people think they need to perform on a \u0000rst date. They\nwant to make a good impression and come across as interesting. But good dates\nare about connecting with another person, not showing o\u0000. It’s like this quote\nfrom Maya Angelou: “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people\nwill forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”\nInstead of trying to be interesting, make the person feel interesting.\nThat means learning how to be a good listener. There’s a lot more to it than\njust hearing what another person is saying. Most of us listen in order to\nformulate our own responses, which puts the focus back on us. The goal is to\nunderstand rather than merely waiting for your turn to talk.\nYou can become a better conversationalist by learning to give support\nresponses rather than shift responses. Sociologist Charles Derber identi\u0000ed a\nshift response as a moment in which you shift the focus of the conversation back\nto yourself. A support response, on the other hand, encourages the speaker to\ncontinue the story. For example, if your date says, “I’m going to Lake Michigan\nwith my family in a few weeks,” a shift response would be: “Oh, I went there a\nfew summers ago.” Even though, on the surface, you’re engaging with what your\ndate has said, you’ve drawn the attention back to yourself. A support response\nmight sound like “Have you been there before?” or “How did your family\nchoose that location?” Support responses indicate that you’re invested in their\nstory and want to hear more. They make your date feel appreciated and amplify\nthe connection between the two of you.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Practice Support Responses\nImagine you’re out, and your date makes one of the\nfollowing statements. Write down a shift response and a\nsupport response to practice recognizing the diﬀerence:\nYour date: “My coworker just got a goldendoodle puppy.”\nShift response:_________ _________ _________ ________\nSupport response:_________ _________ _________ \n________\nYour date: “I’m really into Ken Burns documentaries,\nespecially the one on the Vietnam War.”\nShift response:_________ _________ _________ ________\nSupport response:_________ _________ _________ \n________\nYour date: “I’m thinking about going back to school.”\nShift response:_________ _________ _________ ________\nSupport response:_________ _________ _________ \n________\n8) Limit phone use.\nPlease, please: Keep your phone out of sight. Research from MIT professor\nSherry Turkle found two negative impacts of having a phone on the table when\nyou’re talking to someone: One, it decreases the quality of the conversation.\nPeople naturally tend to discuss more shallow topics, because there’s a fear that\n\f\nat any moment the phone will interrupt them. Two, it weakens the empathetic\nconnection that forms between the two people.\nDespite all the evidence that phones create a barrier to connection, 89 percent\nof people admitted to taking out a phone during their last social interaction.\nDon’t do it!\nTry this approach. At the beginning of the date, ask the other person how\nthey’d feel about both of you committing to putting your phones out of sight.\nYou’ll show you care and increase your chances of the date going well. (You\nmight even bring up Sherry Turkle’s research, because nothing screams “I’m\ngood at sex” like a research citation.)\n9) End on a high note.\nAn artist I know prides himself on always incorporating a happy ending to his\ndates. (No, not that kind! Get your mind out of the gutter and back into this\nbook!) For example, toward the end of the night, he’ll ask the cryptic question,\n“Have you ever been to San Francisco’s secret slide?” and, if his date is curious,\ntake them to this romantic, under-the-radar spot. He understands that the end\nof an experience matters.\nIn a famous experiment, behavioral economists including Daniel Kahneman\ncompared the experiences of patients undergoing a colonoscopy. (Don’t worry,\nthese were all people who needed this exam, not just psych experiment\nvolunteers.) Some patients endured thirty minutes of unpleasantness, while\nothers experienced thirty minutes of unpleasantness with an additional \u0000ve\nminutes of slightly less discomfort tacked onto the end. Perhaps\ncounterintuitively, people preferred the latter experience, even though the whole\nthing lasted longer. That’s because of a phenomenon called the peak-end rule:\nWhen assessing an experience, people judge it based largely on how they felt at\nthe most intense moment and at the end. Their memory isn’t an average of their\nminute-by-minute experiences.\nSo order dessert at the end of the meal. Give the other person a meaningful\ncompliment before you head your separate ways. Take advantage of the peak-end\nrule."

    "raw_text": "10) Use the Post-Date Eight to shift to the experiential mindset.\nJonathan, like many of us, had a long checklist of criteria for his potential\npartner. After his dates, all he could see were the ways people fell short when\nstacked up against his imaginary perfect man. That “Does he check all the\nboxes?” mentality is yet another example of evaluative dating. Checklists aren’t\ninherently bad, but most people’s lists focus on the wrong things—like\nsomeone’s résumé qualities. I designed a di\u0000erent kind of checklist for Jonathan:\none that would help him shift from an evaluative to an experiential mindset.\nInstead of determining if a potential match met a particular requirement, he was\nable, with this list, to tune in to how he felt about his dates. It encouraged him to\nbe present and to focus on what really matters.\nI urged Jonathan to answer these questions on his way home from each date:\nThe Post-Date Eight\n1. What side of me did they bring out?\n2. How did my body feel during the date? Sti\u0000, relaxed, or something in\nbetween?\n3. Do I feel more energized or de-energized than I did before the date?\n4. Is there something about them I’m curious about?\n5. Did they make me laugh?\n6. Did I feel heard?\n7. Did I feel attractive in their presence?\n8. Did I feel captivated, bored, or something in between?\nKnowing he had to answer these questions afterward, Jonathan started\npaying more attention to how he felt during the date. He started agreeing to\nsecond dates with guys who weren’t as impressive on paper but made him feel\noptimistic, attractive, and relaxed. He was able to more quickly reject guys who\nhad impressive backgrounds but left him feeling cold. He allowed himself to\nexperience the date rather than “interviewing” the guy for the role of husband.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Answer the Post-Date Eight\nSnap a photo of those eight prompts and commit to looking\nat them at the end of every date to help you get in touch\nwith how the person made you feel.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. We’re suffering from the rise of evaluative dating—cross-\nexaminations that feel like job interviews. Throw out your\nchecklist and shift to the experiential mindset. Stay present\nand pay attention to how you feel around the other person.\n2. Mindset matters: Whether you believe the date will go well or\npoorly, you’re right. You can use a pre-date ritual to get into\nthe right mental state before a date.\n3. With a little planning, you can design better dates. Be\nthoughtful about where and when you go out. Incorporate\nplay. Choose more creative activities, resist small talk, stay\noff your phone, and end on a high note. Be a good listener by\noffering support responses that encourage your date to\nelaborate on a story, instead of shift responses that direct the\nconversation back to you.\n4. Instead of evaluating your date against certain criteria,\nanswer the Post-Date Eight questions to tune in to how your\ndate makes you feel."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 11\nF**K THE SPARK\nHow to Reject Myths About Instant Chemistry\nWhen you’re going on dates, you may be looking for that instant connection.\nSudden, sexy, intoxicating. It’s physical, a pang of excitement in your gut, a\nfeeling of nervousness when you look into their eyes. You can’t look away. If they\ntouch you, it’s electric. Everyone else in the room fades into the background.\nYou feel tuned in and turned on. You feel alive.\nYou know what I’m talking about: “the spark.”\nI get it, the spark is wonderful. But you know what? F**k the spark. The\nconcept is my nemesis: I’ve come to see our obsession with the spark as one of\nthe most pervasive and dangerous ideas in dating. It causes us to miss out on\namazing partners because we fail to see their true potential. In this chapter, I’ll\nbust a number of myths about the spark. By the end, I hope you’ll be chanting\n“F**k the spark!” too.\nMyth #1: When you meet the right person, you’ll feel instant\nﬁreworks.\nThe Truth: Fireworks and instant chemistry are often absent at the beginning\nof a relationship. Good sex and chemistry can build over time.\nLove at \u0000rst sight is pretty rare. When psychologist Ayala Malach Pines\nsurveyed more than four hundred people to ask how they fell in love with their\nromantic partners, only 11 percent claimed that they felt “love at \u0000rst sight.”\nHave you ever noticed how people tend to date their neighbors? How\ncouples form during freshman year among students who live across the hall from\n\f\neach other or take the same premed classes? That’s because the more we see\nsomething, the more we like it. Psychologists call this the mere exposure e\u0000ect.\nExposure breeds familiarity. We’re attracted to (and feel safe around) familiar\nthings and people.\nA friend of mine used to work as a hostess at an Italian restaurant. When she\n\u0000rst started there, one of the cooks asked her out. She wasn’t attracted to him, so\nshe said no. He respected her answer, and they became friends at work. He’d\ndrive her home from her shifts, and some nights they’d stay up late, drinking\nwith their coworkers, after the restaurant closed. Six months after he’d asked her\nout, she kissed him in the car at the end of the night. He was surprised but\nthrilled. They went out later that week. Today they’re married with two young\nkids.\n“I wasn’t feeling it at \u0000rst,” she told me. “But he grew on me. It took time for\nthose feelings to develop, but now I can’t imagine my life without him.”\nI hear stories like this all the time. Married couples love to tell me about their\ndisastrous \u0000rst (or \u0000rst and second!) dates. The message is clear: The spark can\ngrow. Sometimes it’s a tiny \u0000ame, gasping for breath. If you squelch the \u0000ame\nbefore it has time to breathe, you’ll never get to warm yourself by the \u0000re of\nlong-lasting love. (They should really hire me to write Hallmark cards.)\nA few years ago, psychologists Paul Eastwick and Lucy Hunt explored this\nphenomenon. At the beginning of the semester, they asked straight male\nstudents to rank their straight female classmates’ desirability and vice versa.\nWhen Eastwick and Hunt analyzed the responses, they found that students were\nmore or less in agreement about their classmates’ attractiveness. This initial\nrating, based on \u0000rst impressions, is known as mate value.\nThree months later, at the end of the semester, the researchers asked students\nto evaluate their peers again. Now that the students knew one another, the\nscores had much more variability. These new scores re\u0000ected what’s called\nunique value, what you think of someone after spending time with them.\nHere’s how Eastwick and Hunt explained why the scores changed: When we\n\u0000rst meet people, we evaluate them on their mate value—their overall\nattractiveness and how they carry themselves. As we get to know and share\nexperiences with them, we discover their unique value—who they are on the"

    "raw_text": "inside. In the classroom study, the \u0000rst time the students evaluated one another,\ntheir answers re\u0000ected mate value—basically how hot they found their peers—\nand most people found the same people hot. But by the end of the semester,\nthey judged them on their unique value, which depended on whom they’d\ngotten to know. In many cases, likely because of the mere exposure e\u0000ect, the\nstudents liked their peers more than they had on the \u0000rst day of class. The\nimportance of mate value disappears over time. What matters is how you feel\nabout someone as you get to know them.\nThis phenomenon occurs outside of the classroom, too. When we \u0000rst meet\nsomeone, we form an initial impression, based mostly on appearance. But as we\nget to know the person more, they often grow on us, and we start to see them\ndi\u0000erently.\nThat same lesson applies to sex, too. Good sex often doesn’t magically\nhappen right away. As anyone who’s had a lousy one-night stand can tell you, it\ntakes time to develop a rhythm and learn about someone else’s body and\npreferences (and your own!).\nMyth #2: The spark is always a good thing.\nThe Truth: It’s not. Some people are just really good at making a lot of people\nfeel a spark. Maybe they’re extremely attractive. Perhaps they’re best-in-class\n\u0000irts. Sometimes the presence of a spark is more an indication of how charming\nsomeone is—or how narcissistic—and less a sign of a shared connection. I\nlearned the hard way with Burning Man Brian. He made me (and plenty of\nothers) feel the spark, and I tried desperately to convert that initial excitement\ninto a relationship.\nYou may also think you feel the spark when your date is playing games or\nsending mixed signals. People often confuse anxiety for chemistry (I’m talking to\nyou, anxiously attached friends out there!). It’s time you learned to correctly\nidentify that feeling, like my workout-class friend Vivian did. Then start looking\nfor a di\u0000erent type of partner—someone secure who doesn’t make you doubt\ntheir feelings. Stop believing that if a dependable person doesn’t give you\nbutter\u0000ies, it must not be love. It’s still love, just not the anxious kind.\n\f\nMyth #3: If you have a spark, the relationship is viable.\nThe Truth: Even if the spark leads to a long-term relationship, it’s not nearly\nenough to keep the relationship going. I’ve spoken to couples who stayed\ntogether years longer than they should have, all because of the spark. Many\ndivorced couples once had the spark.\nA friend of mine went to South Korea to teach English after graduating from\ncollege. After three weeks, he was feeling homesick. He missed his family. He’d\nmade no friends. His students barely seemed to register his lessons.\nThen one day, he walked into a local bar as it was closing. He noticed a tall\nblond woman sitting in the corner. She was alone. He watched as she downed\nthe last few sips of her red wine, closed her book, and stood up. She looked\nvaguely like a friend of his from college, a person he missed dearly.\nWhile normally shy, he felt emboldened by the sight of an almost familiar\nface. He walked up to her and said, “Hi! I’m Nathan. Do you live here?”\nNot expecting to hear English, she took a step back. After a moment, she\nsaid, “Uhhh, yes, I do.” She stuck out her hand to introduce herself. “I’m Ava.”\nNathan smiled. She was beautiful and she spoke English. He felt the spark\ninstantly. “Want to \u0000nd another bar and tell me about the book you’re reading?”\nhe asked.\nThey dated for a year in South Korea and then moved to St. Louis together.\nThey got married the following year.\nBut the relationship faltered. “In retrospect, all of the warning signs were\nthere,” Nathan told me. “We were so di\u0000erent. Even on that \u0000rst date, she was\nreading a book, and I was just trying to get drunk.”\nThey’d changed the subject when certain topics came up—like the fact that\nhe wanted children and she didn’t, or that she wanted to return to South Korea\nand he felt ready to put down roots in St. Louis. “I guess we just ignored our\ndi\u0000erences because of that initial spark.”\nAfter less than a year of marriage, they could no longer ignore their\ndiscontent.\n“I really feel like our whole relationship was propelled by our how-we-met\nstory,” he said. “If we hadn’t had this picturesque story of meeting abroad, of"

    "raw_text": "love at \u0000rst sight, I don’t know that we ever would’ve gotten married. Our whole\nlives were trying to live up to that fantasy meeting.”\nDon’t pursue the wrong relationship because you met the “right” way.\nDITCHING THE SPARK FOR THE SLOW BURN\nThe spark isn’t a bad thing in and of itself. It can be a useful signal that you’re\nattracted to someone. Plenty of good relationships start with the spark, but\nplenty of bad ones do, too. The important thing to remember is that its absence\ndoesn’t predict failure, and its presence doesn’t guarantee success. As my\nmathematician client said to me once, “The spark is neither necessary nor\nsu\u0000cient for long-term relationship happiness.”\nStop using the spark as your \u0000rst-date indicator. Stop optimizing for that\nexciting feeling and focus on what matters, like loyalty, kindness, and how the\nother person makes you feel (and return to Chapter 7 if you need a reminder).\nDitch the spark and go for the slow burn—someone who may not be\nparticularly charming upon your \u0000rst meeting but would make a great long-term\npartner. Slow burns take time to warm up, but they’re worth the wait. In the\nnext chapter, I’ll help you decide how to identify a promising slow burn, why\nyou should give that person a chance, and when to call it.\nA medical student friend of mine named Katrina had minimal success on\ndating apps. She is shy, which comes across as aloof on early dates. While she was\ngoing on \u0000rst date after \u0000rst date, she started spending time with her neighbor\nSuzanna. She would tell Suzanna all about her dating disasters. Months into the\nfriendship, Suzanna confessed her love to Katrina. They started dating shortly\nafter that. Suzanna told me that she continues to fall deeper and deeper in love\nwith Katrina. That’s the power of the slow burn."

You may not feel the spark with someone,\nsimply because of the environment in which you meet.\n3. The spark is not always a good thing. That feeling of\nchemistry may actually be anxiety because the person\ndoesn’t make it clear how they feel about you. Sometimes the\npresence of a spark is more an indication of how charming\nsomeone is—or how narcissistic—and less a sign of a shared\nconnection.\n4. If you feel the spark, that doesn’t necessarily mean the\nrelationship is viable. Even if it leads you into a long-term\nrelationship, it’s not nearly enough to keep the relationship\ngoing; nor is it a sign that you’re meant to be together.\n5.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 12\nGO ON THE SECOND DATE\nHow to Decide if You Should See Someone Again\nOver time, Jonathan, my client who had been going on dates that felt like job\ninterviews, changed his approach. He ditched the co\u0000ee shop for a tiki bar near\nhis house with great bartenders and \u0000attering lighting. A place just noisy enough\nto give him an excuse to whisper in his date’s ear. And he stopped worrying\nabout the spark.\nSoon we were able to laugh at that seven a.m. co\u0000ee date. Jonathan had\nmastered the \u0000rst date. But he struggled to decide whom to see again.\n“Honestly,” he told me during one session, “I’m meeting a lot of nice guys.\nBut after the date, I \u0000nd myself dwelling on their \u0000aws: boring job, cheesy sense\nof humor, wearing a vest.”\nIt wasn’t Jonathan’s fault that he tended to focus on the negative. Our brain\nevolved to do just that. (And in my opinion, wearing a vest should not disqualify\nanyone from a second date. As comedian Demetri Martin explains, vests have a\npurpose: You never know when you might encounter a “narrow cold front.”)\nFortunately, we can take action to override these impulses so that we don’t\nmiss out on great matches for silly reasons. We can train our mind to look for the\npositive and follow the dating version of the Golden Rule: Do not judge\nothers the way you would not want to be judged.\nTHE NEGATIVITY BIAS\nIn my interview with Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist and the author of\nseveral popular books on relationships, she explained that our brains have\n\f\ndeveloped a negativity bias, an instinct to ruminate on what’s gone wrong.\nIf you’ve ever received feedback from a manager or coworker, what do you\nremember more clearly: the compliments or the criticism? This is the negativity\nbias in action. Fisher said that our brain evolved to vividly remember negative\nexperiences so that we can avoid them in the future. This wiring helped us to\nperceive and avoid threats. If you almost get eaten by a saber-toothed tiger, it’s\nhelpful to remember what that animal looks like and where it lives. We have\nfewer \u0000esh-eating predators around these days, but our brains still hold on to the\nmodern equivalent: “If you have \u0000ve ex-girlfriends and one of them hates you,”\nFisher said, “it’s helpful to remember which one that is.”\nBut this mindset that served our ancestors well, and retains some value,\ncreates challenges today—especially for dating. It means we’re likely to\nremember a person’s bad qualities most clearly after a date. (Which is why you\nremember your last date as the girl whose breath smelled like scallion pancakes,\nnot the one who raved about your out\u0000t.)\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL-ATTRIBUTION ERROR\nIn addition to the negativity bias, we unconsciously fall prey to cognitive biases\nthat make us bad judges of character. One such bias is the fundamental-\nattribution error, our tendency to believe someone’s actions re\u0000ect who they\nare rather than the circumstances. When someone makes a mistake, we interpret\nthe misstep as revealing something essential, and essentially bad, about that\nperson’s character. We don’t look for external reasons to explain the behavior.\nFor example, if someone arrives late to a date, we see them as sel\u0000sh instead of\nassuming they hit tra\u0000c. Or if they don’t text back when they said they would,\nthey must be inconsiderate rather than experiencing a busy week at work. You\nknow as well as I do that these generalizations aren’t fair. But in the moment,\nour brains naturally make those leaps.\nLOOK FOR THE POSITIVES\nIt’s no surprise that, thanks to the negativity bias and the fundamental-\nattribution error, Jonathan’s \u0000rst instinct was to turn down second dates. But if\n\f\nhe wanted to \u0000nd a long-term partner, he had to learn how to override these\nnatural impulses and seek the positive. If not, he’d misjudge a lot of wonderful\npotential partners. If he couldn’t get to the second date, how would he ever\nachieve his goal of walking down the aisle?\nSeeing the positives in life is a muscle, a skill you can develop. It requires\npractice. Psychologist Shawn Achor’s research on gratitude journals found that\nsimply writing down three new things you are grateful for, every night for three\nweeks, will start to change the way your brain perceives the world. The exercise\ntrains you to notice things you might have otherwise missed, like how wonderful\nit is to catch the bus right before it leaves or how good it feels to laugh with your\ncoworker.\nYou can do the same thing in your dating life. Train yourself to see the\npositives. Look for what others might miss when they talk to the same person.\nAs philosopher and writer Alain de Botton told me: Rather than focusing on\nsomeone’s negative traits, use your “imagination” to “search for what is desirable\nand good.”\nI once coached a guy named Grant who was incredibly negative. Almost\nevery sentence started with “Yes, but…” He lived life with his arms crossed over\nhis chest, ready to challenge even good news. Unsurprisingly, his post-date texts\nto me were like mini–Mean Girls burn books: “Too short, didn’t laugh, boring\njob, might want to move back to Canada, mispronounced the word\n‘concomitant.’ ”\nAt our next meeting, I sat him down. “Grant, you are not simply a\ncompilation of your worst qualities or habits, right? You are not your \u0000aws. You\nare a whole person with good traits and bad ones, and you want to be seen and\nevaluated based on that whole package, not just your areas for improvement. Do\nnot judge others the way you would not want to be judged.”\nAfter each date, he wasn’t allowed to list his date’s \u0000aws to anyone, including\nhimself. Instead, he had to send me \u0000ve nice things he noticed about her. Just\nlike Alain de Botton said, he had to use his imagination and see beyond the\nsurface.\nIn the beginning, Grant found this exercise tough. He wrote things like “was\nnot late” and “did not misuse any words.” Over time, he got better at it. Here’s\n\f\none list he sent me:\n1. She’s kind. I love the way she treats the restaurant sta\u0000.\n2. She’s thoughtful. She asked me about my big meeting at work.\n3. She’s family-oriented. She actually seemed interested in hearing about my\ngrandma.\n4. She’s super-smart.\n5. GOOD KISSER!!!\nEven though he hasn’t found his person yet, Grant is going out on far more\nsecond dates these days. He’s learned to use his imagination and, by extension,\ngiven himself the time to explore, understand, and appreciate potential partners.\nEXERCISE: Look for the Positives\nLook for the positives in people, whether you’re evaluating\nthem on a dating app or they’re across the table from you at\na restaurant. It will be easy to see their ﬂaws—the way our\nbrain has evolved practically guarantees it. But force\nyourself to look for the good. After your next date, text a\nfriend ﬁve things you liked about your date. Heck, if it helps,\nyou can even email them to me\n(5goodthings@loganury.com).\nNow, that will help you spot the positives. But what happens when your date\nmakes a mistake and the fundamental-attribution error kicks in? You can choose\nto override this impulse by coming up with an alternate—more compassionate\n—explanation for their behavior.\nSituation: He’s late to your \u0000rst date.\nFundamental-attribution mode: He’s sel\u0000sh.\n\f\nCompassion mode: Even though he left his house an hour before your date, his\ntrain was delayed.\nSituation: He’s slow to respond to initial dating messages.\nFundamental-attribution mode: He’s rude.\nCompassion mode: He has a lot going on at work this week but is still trying to\n\u0000nd time to date.\nSituation: She made a bad joke during dinner.\nFundamental-attribution mode: She has a cheesy sense of humor and we’re\nnot compatible.\nCompassion mode: She was nervous and tried to make me laugh.\nTry switching into compassion mode the next time you \u0000nd yourself in one of\nthese situations, so you don’t mistakenly reject a wonderful potential match.\nHARNESS THE POWER OF DEFAULTS\nAll of the mindset changes I’m describing are hard. It’s natural to focus on\nsomeone’s negative qualities and decide you don’t want to go out with that\nperson again. But there’s a way to make this whole thing a lot easier: Harness the\npower of defaults.\nCountless behavioral science experiments demonstrate how defaults, or\npreset options that require no action, impact our behavior. Imagine you’re\nsetting up a menu at a burger joint and you need to choose the go-to side, what\nyour customer will automatically get with a burger. Will it come with fries,\nwhich people can swap out for a salad? Or will it arrive with salad, but people\ncan request fries instead? Whatever you select will become the default option,\nwhich the majority of people will stick with.\nYou can see the power of defaults by looking at this graph:"

    "raw_text": "As the graph shows, in some European countries, almost everyone is signed\nup to donate their organs. In other countries, barely anyone has registered as a\ndonor. While we might attribute this to di\u0000erences such as religious views or a\nmore or less communitarian approach, that’s not the case. Similar countries (like\nDenmark and Sweden) have very di\u0000erent organ donation rates.\nWhy did this happen? It isn’t because of religion or culture but, rather,\ndefaults. People tend to stick with the default, especially around hard emotional\ndecisions like what to do with your body when you die. In some countries, like\nthe \u0000rst four shown in the graph on the previous page in the lighter color, the\nform at the DMV says, “Check the box if you want to participate.” Very few\npeople check the box, and thus very few people sign up. In countries where the\nform says, “Check the box if you don’t want to participate,” again, very few\npeople checked the box, and thus most people are automatically enrolled. This\naccounts for the high participation rates in the other countries in the graph. In\nboth cases, the majority of people stuck with the default option and didn’t check\nthe box. This tiny di\u0000erence—created by a person at the DMV who designed the\nform—had a huge impact on something as vital as organ donation.\nYou can use defaults to your advantage in all kinds of ways. For example, a\nfriend of mine wanted to lose weight. He established a default for himself: no\nbread. When someone o\u0000ers him bread, he refuses it. He doesn’t waste\nbrainpower on the decision. He follows his default rule.\n\f\nNow imagine the implications for your dating life. You can design defaults to\nhelp you make better decisions. Why not set a default that you’ll go on the\nsecond date? Not only will this help you avoid the brain’s natural tendency to\nfocus on the negative, it will also help you look for that slow-burn person instead\nof seeking the spark.\nOf course, there are exceptions. But assume you’ll go out with someone a\nsecond time unless something dramatic happens to dissuade you. (Like that\nhypothetical person who shows up two hours late, smelling of lobster, and on\ncrystal meth.)\nMy client Emma was going on very few dates when we met. We worked on\nher pro\u0000le, her opening lines, her listening skills, and more. We set a goal of at\nleast one date a week. Being the overachieving, metrics-driven operations\nmanager she is, she went from having very few dates to multiple dates a week.\nAfter a month, I realized I was rarely hearing the same name twice. “Emma,\nare you going on any second dates?” I asked in our next session.\nShe thought about it for a moment. “No, I guess not. Just \u0000rst dates. But\nlook at how many I’ve had!”\n“That’s great,” I said. “But don’t lose sight of our overall goal—helping you\n\u0000nd a long-term partner. I want you to try to go on more second and third dates\nwith people.”\nShe agreed to make second dates her default rather than the exception. A\nweek later, she sent me a text: “I already have second dates lined up with both of\nthe guys I went out with yesterday!”\nIt might seem obvious, but this simple change—from focusing on second\ndates instead of \u0000rst ones—made a meaningful di\u0000erence to her approach.\nWithin another month, she found herself on a second, and then a third, and\nthen a tenth date with a great guy who was getting over a di\u0000cult breakup. “He\nwas afraid of getting hurt, but we just kept going out. We got deeper and deeper\nuntil we’d built an intense bond.” They’re still dating—and considering moving\nto Austin together.\nIn the end, it was the default-second-date rule that led Jonathan to meet his\nnow-partner. Jonathan said that before we worked together, he likely wouldn’t\nhave gone out with this guy in the \u0000rst place because he is below Jonathan’s"

Luckily, he gave the\nguy another shot.\n“My boyfriend is driven and successful, but not in the ways I originally\nexpected. We have so much fun together. He’s a phenomenal listener and\ncommunicator. We have incredible chemistry. He’s also super-attentive to my\nneeds. In the past, I thought I wanted this big CEO type, but it turns out that’s\nnot what makes me ful\u0000lled. Letting go of that faulty list of requirements was a\ngame changer—it enabled me to focus on our experiences together.”\nThe stakes here are pretty low. When you’re on a \u0000rst date, you’re not\nlooking to \u0000ll the position of life partner, you’re looking to decide whether or\nnot you want a second date. That’s it. It’s better to go on a second or third date\nwith somebody and then \u0000nd out that they’re not a good \u0000t than to rule out\npotential matches because of an initial impression that’s vulnerable to all types\nof cognitive biases.\nEXERCISE: Make the Second Date the Default\n“I, _________ _________ ______, commit to going on more\nsecond dates.”\nSignature:_________ _________ ______\nDate:_________ _________ _________ _________\nPPPS (PERMISSIBLE PET PEEVES)\nThe second-date default will help you give more people a chance. So will my next\ntip: Stop confusing pet peeves with dealbreakers. Actual dealbreakers are\nfundamental incompatibilities that doom a potential relationship. For example,\nif you and your date practice di\u0000erent religions, and you both want your kids to\n\f\nbe raised solely in your faith. Anything less important is a nice-to-have but not a\nrequirement.\nA few years ago, I attended a happy-hour event. A woman in her mid-thirties\napproached me and said she wanted to talk about her dating life. Her name was\nMariah.\n“I’m really open to meeting someone,” she said, “as long as he’s not a mouth\nbreather.”\nIn our conversation, I discovered that one of the reasons Mariah had been\nsingle for many years was because she did things like divide all men into two\ncategories: mouth breathers and non–mouth breathers.\nYeah, sure, mouth breathing is annoying. So is talking with your mouth full\nor interrupting people or leaving your clothes all over the house until you can’t\nsee the \u0000oor. (All things I do.) But there’s absolutely no research that correlates\nnon–mouth breathing with successful long-term relationships.\nPrioritize what actually matters long term. Do not let yourself get o\u0000 track\nbecause of small distractions. You may be using these distractions as a defense\nmechanism—a way of staying single while still giving the appearance of dating,\nto avoid, for whatever reason, taking the leap into a relationship.\nThat’s what was going on with Mariah. She was guilty of mistaking a PPP\n(Permissible Pet Peeve) for a dealbreaker. Let’s make sure we have our\nde\u0000nitions straight:\nPet Peeve: a minor thing that an individual \u0000nds particularly annoying, perhaps\nmore than other people do.\nPPP (Permissible Pet Peeve): a preference that feels like a dealbreaker but is\nreally just a pet peeve.\nDealbreaker: a genuine reason not to date someone.\nThink about your big dealbreaker. Is there any way you could imagine being\nin a long-term relationship with someone who has this characteristic? If yes, it is\nnot a dealbreaker. For example, suppose you are a straight woman and one of the\ndealbreakers for your potential partner is “he’s shorter than \u0000ve-ten.” Now\n\f\nimagine you met someone gorgeous, charming, kind, a good listener with\namazing friends who made you laugh—but then he stood up and you saw he\nwas \u0000ve-nine. Would you still want to date him? Almost certainly yes. Height is\nnot a dealbreaker.\nBut let’s say you’re certain you don’t want kids. And you go on a great \u0000rst\ndate that ends with your date gushing about her nieces and nephews and how\nshe can’t wait to be a parent. I don’t care how gorgeous she is and how much\nyou loved spending time with her—you two have fundamentally di\u0000erent plans\nfor the future. That’s a dealbreaker.\nOther examples of dealbreakers include: One of you wants monogamy, the\nother doesn’t believe in it. One of you has very old-fashioned views about gender\nroles in relationships, the other believes in a di\u0000erent balance. You smoke and\naren’t willing to quit, and the other person has serious asthma.\nPush yourself to make two di\u0000erent lists: What are critical dealbreakers for\nyou? And what are just preferences or nice-to-haves? This exercise really helped\nJonathan. It was how he determined that height was way less important than he\nthought. So was being a business executive. But he knew he could never date\nsomeone who didn’t have a sense of humor.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Identify Genuine Dealbreakers\nUsing our new deﬁnitions, write out what truly matters to\nyou.\nActual dealbreakers:\n1. \n2. \n3. \nPermissible Pet Peeves that I won’t confuse with\ndealbreakers:\n1. \n2. \n3. \nNice-to-haves that I won’t confuse with dealbreakers:\n1. \n2. \n3. \nHOW MANY DATES DO I NEED TO GO ON BEFORE I CALL IT?\nIf you’re on board with going on second dates as a default, the next question is:\nHow long should I see this person? Should third dates be defaults?"

    "raw_text": "I can’t tell you that two or three dates are all it takes to know if someone\ncould be a great long-term partner. There’s no data to determine that number.\nTake a look at what unfolds when you two hang out: Do you enjoy spending\ntime with this person? Do they make you happy? Do you like who you are with\nthem? Do you want to kiss them? Is your interest in them growing, waning, or\njust kind of trudging along? If your date is rude or disrespectful—to you or\nanyone else—don’t see that person again. Ditto if your date made you feel\nuncomfortable, anxious, or sad.\nTake an honest look at yourself. How old are you? How long have you been\ngoing on dates and complaining that there’s no spark? Maybe it’s time to switch\nthings up and give someone a try. Look back at the Secretary Problem that I\ndescribed in Chapter 4. Realize that you’ve likely already met someone who\nwould make a great long-term partner.\nLook, I’m not telling you to go out and put a ring on it right away. You’ll\nhave plenty of time between the second date and that milestone to re\u0000ect on the\nrelationship. I don’t want you to get married because of a default! Instead, focus\non the question at hand: Do you want to see this person again? If so, let them\nknow!\n\f\nGHOSTBUSTERS PLEDGE: DON’T YOU DARE GHOST!\nYou’ll inevitably reach a moment when you decide you don’t want\nto move forward with someone. What should you do? Ghost? NO!\nOF COURSE NOT. This whole book is about making intentional\ndating decisions. And that includes how you choose to end things.\nHere’s how I deﬁne ghosting: communication in which one\nparty has the expectation of a response from the other person and\ndoesn’t get it. For example, if two people went on a date and\nneither texted the other person afterward, I call that a mutual\nopt-out, not ghosting. But if they went out and one person wrote\nback and said, “Hey, that was fun. Can I see you again?” and the\nother person never responded? That’s ghosting.\nWhy do people ghost? I’ve interviewed dozens of people about\ntheir ghosting habits. Here’s what I heard:\n“I ghost because I don’t know how to explain why I don’t want\nto see them again.”\n“I ghost because it’s uncomfortable to reject people.”\n“I ghost because it’s less hurtful to just disappear than to\nstraight-out reject someone.”\nPeople often ghost because they think they’re avoiding an\nawkward situation and protecting that person’s feelings.\nBut that’s just not true. Ghosting is awkward. Plus, it’s hurtful\nand leaves the other person in limbo. Besides those obvious\nreasons not to ghost, here’s another one: Ghosting makes\n“ghosters” feel worse than if they’d been up front with their\nfeelings.\nTwo cognitive biases help explain why this happens: ﬁrst, our\npoor ability to make aﬀective forecasts. In other words, we’re\nlousy at predicting how situations will make us feel in the future,\nlike how we’ll feel after we’ve ghosted someone. Second, our views\nabout ourselves change over time, depending on how we behave.\nAccording to psychologist Daryl Bem’s self-perception theory,\nthis happens because we don’t have access to our inner thoughts"

Volunteers\nconsistently see higher levels of happiness and self-esteem than\nnon-volunteers, because when they’re done, they look at their\nactions and think, I’m spending my time helping people. I must be\npretty generous after all!\nPeople ghost to avoid feeling awkward. Yet, in accordance with\nself-perception theory, after people ghost they look at their\nactions and think, I did kind of a mean thing. I might be a dick. And\nthen they feel worse about themselves.\nI ran a small experiment to prove that ghosting makes people\nfeel worse, not better. I recruited participants through Facebook\nand Reddit. These were self-described ghosters who claimed to\nghost people at least once a month. In a survey, I asked them how\nhappy they predicted they’d feel on a scale from one to ﬁve (not at\nall happy to very happy) after either A) ghosting someone or B)\nsending someone a more straightforward text saying they weren’t\ninterested.\nUnsurprisingly, most of these ghostly respondents anticipated\nthey’d feel “neutral” to “happy” after ghosting someone and would\nfeel “somewhat unhappy” to “not at all happy” after sending the\nrejection text.\nI told half the group to rank their happiness on that same one-\nto-ﬁve scale the next time they ghosted. I asked the other half not\nto ghost. If they met someone they didn’t want to see again, I\ninstructed them to send this message afterward: “Hey [insert\nname]. I really enjoyed talking about [insert conversation topic]. I\ndon’t think we’re a romantic match, but I enjoyed meeting you.” I\nasked these people to send me screenshots of what they sent and\nthe responses (if any) they received.\nWhat do you think happened? Most of the ghosters who did not\nsend a message reported feeling neutral to not very happy about\ntheir behavior. In follow-up interviews, they said they felt guilty\nand that when the person checked in multiple times after the ﬁrst\n\f\ndate to see if they wanted to go out again, it made them want to\navoid their phones altogether.\nThose who sent the straightforward message indicating that\nthey weren’t interested received positive reinforcement from the\nother person almost two-thirds of the time. In the other cases, the\nperson didn’t write back at all. There was only one incident in\nwhich the person wrote back and requested more information\nabout what was wrong, and that escalated into a ﬁght.\nWhen people ghost, they think they’re taking the easy path for\nthemselves. But they’re wrong. If we instead choose the kind, up-\nfront, polite path, we get positive reinforcement. The person is\nlikely to respond and say something like: “Thanks for letting me\nknow. Good luck out there.” Hear that sound? It’s a sigh of relief.\nWe feel better because the person has just aﬃrmed that we are a\ngood person.\nHopefully, I’ve convinced you why you shouldn’t ghost. But\nsometimes it’s diﬃcult to compose that “Thank you, next” text.\nMake it easy on yourself. Go to the Notes folder on your phone or\nsave a copy of the Mad Libs–style goodbye text I gave you above.\nCommit to sending it as soon as you realize you’re not interested\nin someone.\nREJECTION DOS AND DON’TS\nDo:\n1.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 13\nDECIDE, DON’T SLIDE\nHow to Consciously Navigate Relationship Milestones\nHave you ever polished o\u0000 an entire tub of movie theater popcorn by yourself,\nnot realizing how much you were eating until your hand grazed the cardboard\nbottom? If you’re anything like me, probably. What about eating a whole\npackage of snack-size bags in one sitting? Probably not. That’s because reaching\nthe end of a container—however big or small—creates a decision point: a\nmoment that interrupts our automatic behavior and gives us an opportunity to\nmake a conscious choice. In this case: “Do I want to keep eating popcorn?”\nResearch by behavioral scientists Amar Cheema and Dilip Soman\ndemonstrated the power of decision points in a clever (and, I assume, delicious)\nstudy. They gave each participant a package of twenty cookies to snack on while\ncompleting a series of tasks. They packaged the cookies in three di\u0000erent ways:\nall twenty stacked in one column; divided up into smaller sections with white\nwaxed paper; or divided up with pieces of colored waxed paper.\nThe tasks themselves didn’t matter. What the researchers really cared about\nwas whether the packaging a\u0000ected how many cookies the participants ate and\nhow quickly they ate them. They found that the participants whose cookies were\nseparated by colored paper ate fewer cookies and took longer to consume them.\nThat’s because the colored waxed paper created more obvious decision points,\nchances to shift their brains from unconscious thinking (or, in this case,\nsnacking) to deliberate decision-making. The stack of cookies o\u0000ered no\ndecision point, and the white waxed paper was easy to ignore. But the colored\npaper jolted the cookie eaters out of their mindless snacking and forced them to\nconsider: “Should I keep eating these cookies?”\n\f\nAll areas of life present decision points, not just eating cookies or popcorn.\nRelationships, in particular, are full of decision points. Many of them stress us\nout and keep us up at night. But I see decision points as gifts—opportunities to\npause, take a breath, and re\u0000ect on what we’re doing. We can take inventory of\nour lives and strategize about our next move. This allows us to make better,\nmore thoughtful decisions.\nBut relationship decision points are never as obvious as the colored pieces of\npaper that divided the cookies. They can be easy to miss, especially when we’re\nbeing carried along by the momentum of life.\nPsychologists describe two ways couples transition into the next stage of a\nrelationship: deciding or sliding. Deciding means making intentional choices\nabout relationship transitions, like becoming exclusive or having children.\nSliding entails slipping into the next stage without giving it much thought. This\ndistinction matters. The National Marriage Project, an annual report on\nAmerican marriages conducted by researchers at the University of Virginia,\nfound that couples who made a conscious choice to advance to the next stage of\ntheir relationship enjoyed higher-quality marriages than those who slid into the\nnext stage. Furthermore, researchers from the University of Louisville and the\nUniversity of Denver found that individuals who tend to “slide” through\nrelationship milestones feel less dedicated to their partners and engage in more\nextramarital a\u0000airs. These \u0000ndings suggest sliding through decision points can\nput a relationship at risk. While relationships present many crucial decision\npoints, in this chapter, I’ll help you address two of them: de\u0000ning the\nrelationship and moving in together.\nDEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP (DTR)\nRemember my client Jing? She was the Hesitater who started dating for the \u0000rst\ntime at thirty-one. After a few short romances, she began seeing a guy named\nJames. She loved his friends. They were kind, welcoming, and hilarious. But\nmost of all she loved how quickly James had introduced her to them. She met his\nfamily shortly afterward, at a rowdy Sunday dinner with his mom, dad, sisters,"

Finally, she thought, she’d found the\nrelationship she’d been looking for.\n“Exactly four months to the day after we met, we went away for the\nweekend,” Jing told me during our meeting. He drove, she navigated. “When my\nphone died, I asked if I could pull up the directions on his phone.” James\nhesitated. “He said something about needing to keep his phone near him in case\nhis manager texted.”\nJing could tell something wasn’t right. She grabbed his phone. Even without\nunlocking it, she could see the noti\u0000cations coming in from dating apps: You’ve\ngot a match! Her heart sped up as she scrolled down, reading the name of each\ngirl he’d matched and messaged with.\n“What is this?” she said.\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “But we never said we were exclusive.”\nThat was the last time they hung out.\nJing told me this experience left her humiliated. In her mind, meeting James’s\nfamily and friends and going away together meant they were in an exclusive\nrelationship. She’d deleted her apps and told her mom she had a boyfriend. But\nJames had a di\u0000erent perspective: They were not exclusive until they’d explicitly\nhad the talk. You know, the chat when you check in on what you’re doing\ntogether, aka the DTR (de\u0000ne the relationship) or the WUWU (what’s up with\nus?). “I just feel so pathetic,” she said.\nJing wasn’t alone. And she wasn’t struggling with misaligned expectations\njust because she was relatively new to dating. All the time, I see people making\ndi\u0000erent assumptions about what’s going on in their love lives. They avoid\nbringing up the DTR because it feels awkward, or they’re scared they’ll ruin\nthings.\nBut the DTR is an essential decision point. It’s a chance to discuss where you\nare and where you’re headed. If someone doesn’t take you seriously as a potential\npartner, wouldn’t you rather know that sooner than later? In order to gain the\ninsight you need to make the right choice for yourself, you must DTR. It’s also\nimportant from a sexual health perspective. If either of you is sleeping with\nsomeone else, the other one deserves to know."

    "raw_text": "There’s no perfect time to DTR. Bring up the conversation when you feel\nlike you’re ready to stop seeing other people and would feel comfortable calling\nthe person your boyfriend or girlfriend. This is di\u0000erent for everyone. If you\nknow you’re someone who rushes into things, check in with a few friends for a\ngut check on your timing. (Rushing to DTR is common among anxiously\nattached folks. Revisit Chapter 6 for a refresher.)\nMake sure to talk in person. Think through how you’ll open the\nconversation. One trick for tough talks is to start by announcing how awkward\nyou feel. This alerts the person to the fact that you feel vulnerable, which helps\nelicit a more empathetic response. Try an opener like “I feel awkward bringing\nthis up, but…” or “It’s always hard to ask this, but…”\nObviously, you could just straight up ask, “Are we dating?” If that feels too\ndirect, one technique is to say you’re confused about how to refer to this person\nin the presence of others. For example, “My friends are asking me what we are.\nWhat should I tell them?” or “How should I introduce you tonight when we\nmeet my coworkers?”\nBe clear with the other person about what you want to know. Are you\nlooking for clarity on your labels? Do you want to know if you’re sexually\nexclusive? Are you hoping to complete the ultimate modern-day romantic ritual:\ndeleting your dating apps?\nYou may not get the response you want. Remember, this is a conversation,\nnot a negotiation. Respect what the other person says. Listen. This is about\nlearning how they feel, not persuading them to give you what you want.\nEven if you don’t receive the answer you hoped for, at least you have\nadditional information. More data is always better in these situations. Now you\ncan decide for yourself whether you want to stay or go.\nThat’s what happened with Jing. Several months after the James debacle, she\nmet someone new, a friend of a friend named Cal. She didn’t want to repeat\nwhat had happened with James, so a few weeks after she started seeing Cal, she\nbrought up the DTR.\nCal said he was struggling to get over his ex and didn’t feel like he could\ncommit right away. He wanted to continue seeing Jing but wasn’t ready for\n\f\nlabels or exclusivity. Jing decided that worked for her: She felt comfortable\ncontinuing to date Cal, even though they hadn’t made the relationship o\u0000cial.\n“I actually feel \u0000ne about it,” she explained to me. “I realized I don’t need\nhim to commit just yet. What matters is that he’s being clear with me.”\nKeep in mind: The way you handle the DTR will have an impact on your\nfuture relationship, whether or not you decide to make it o\u0000cial at that\nmoment. If you want a relationship, and you discover the other person does, too,\nyou’ll feel happy and relieved. But what if you don’t get the answer you’re\nlooking for? Make sure you thank them for sharing, even if you’re disappointed\nwith the news.\nWelcome their words with compassion and curiosity to show your partner\nthey’re free to tell you what’s on their mind, even if it’s not what you want to\nhear.\nEXERCISE: Prepare for the DTR\nSit down with a journal and answer the following questions\nto help you prepare for this conversation:\n1. How do you want to open the conversation?\n2. What’s your goal for the conversation?\n3. How will you respond if the other person shies away\nfrom the topic or isn’t ready to DTR?\nCheck out the Critical Conversation Planning Doc in the\nAppendix for more information on prepping for this\ndiscussion.\nMOVING IN TOGETHER\nOne of the most important decision points in a relationship is choosing to get\nmarried.

    "raw_text": "Instagram post.) But for many modern couples, the decision to move in together\ncomes \u0000rst.\nWhile the U.S. population has grown by 80 percent since 1960, the number\nof unmarried couples living together before marriage has exploded by 1,500\npercent (from around 450,000 in 1960 to 7.5 million today); 50 to 60 percent of\ncouples now live together before they get married.\nBut many people don’t take this decision point as seriously as they should.\nThey think of moving in together as the ideal way to test their relationship. The\nPew Research Center surveyed a nationally representative panel of randomly\nselected U.S. adults. Two thirds of respondents between the ages of eighteen to\ntwenty-nine agreed that couples who live together before marriage are more\nlikely to have a successful marriage. However, the research into living together\nbefore marriage tells a di\u0000erent story: Married couples who move in together\nbefore they get married tend to be less satis\u0000ed and more likely to divorce than\nthose who don’t. This association is known as the cohabitation e\u0000ect.\nWhen researchers \u0000rst investigated the cohabitation e\u0000ect, they \u0000gured only a\ncertain kind of couple moved in together before marriage. These couples, the\nresearchers assumed, were laxer about marriage and thus more open to the idea\nof getting divorced. However, as more and more people choose to cohabitate\nbefore marriage, it’s much harder to say that only a particular type of couple is\nchoosing this path.\nResearchers have a new theory. They now blame living together itself.\nConsider two hypothetical couples: Ethan and Jamie and Adam and Emily.\nEthan and Jamie move in together because Jamie’s lease is up. Adam and Emily\ndiscuss moving in together but decide they’re not ready yet.\nBoth relationships deteriorate over time. Adam and Emily end their\nrelationship, but Ethan and Jamie do not. That’s because they now share a dog, a\nrubber tree plant, and a secondhand West Elm rug. The process of separating\ntheir stu\u0000, \u0000nding new places to live, and coming up with a calendar to share the\ndog is expensive and annoying. Instead, they end up getting married and then\ndivorcing a few years later. What does the tale of Ethan and Jamie teach us?

    "raw_text": "occurred if the couple hadn’t moved in together. Second, never buy a\nsecondhand rug.\nMoving in together makes it harder to be honest with yourself about the\nquality of the relationship because the cost of separating goes up signi\u0000cantly.\nYet again, we encounter the status quo bias, our tendency to leave things as they\nare. When you break up with someone you live with, you’re not just changing\nyour relationship status, you’re also upending your housing situation and your\ndaily routines. This makes the status quo bias even harder to overcome. If you\nmove in together and things aren’t great, you’re more likely to stay in the\nrelationship than if you each had your own space.\nSince moving in together makes you more likely to get married, honor this\nmoment as the milestone—and decision point—that it is. Forty-two percent of\ncouples who decided their way into living together enjoyed a happy marriage,\ncompared to 28 percent of those who slid. (If these numbers seem low, that’s the\nsad reality of long-term marital satisfaction for most couples. But there are ways\nto buck this trend. I’ll tell you more in the last chapter.)\nThe practicalities of life—like wanting to save money—are fair reasons to\nstart the conversation about moving in together. But make sure your discussion\ncovers more than just logistical questions, like how to split rent and who’s in\ncharge of decorating. Arguing over whose couch to keep or what neighborhood\nto live in does not count as planning your future together. Take this moment to\nbe intentional. Con\u0000rm that you and your partner are aligned on where the\nrelationship is now and where it’s headed in the future. Decide, don’t slide.\nSometimes moving in means one thing to one person and something\ncompletely di\u0000erent to the other one. But without this type of conversation, a\ncouple may not discover the misalignment until it’s too late and they’ve already\nsigned the lease.\nWhen Priya and Kathryn approached the conversation, it didn’t turn out the\nway they expected. “We \u0000rst discussed it after a year,” Priya told me. “Kathryn\nfound this great place near my o\u0000ce and wanted us to take it. She felt ready.”\n“We loved each other, this place was perfect, and we weren’t getting any\nyounger,” Kathryn added.\n\f\nDuring that talk, they discovered they weren’t aligned. For Kathryn, moving\nin together was the logical next step in their relationship but wasn’t a clear sign\nabout whether they’d get married. For Priya, moving in carried the expectation\nthat they were going to get married.\n“In my mind, if I move in with you, I’m planning to marry you,” she said.\n“Maybe I won’t, but that’s the intention.” Priya worried that once she and\nKathryn moved in together, they might stay together out of inertia. Priya saw\nthe moving-in-together decision point as closely tied to the marriage one. “I said\nto Kathryn, ‘I respect where you’re coming from, and I just need a little bit more\ntime before it feels like the right moment.’ ”\nFor some couples, deciding not to move in together might signal the end of\nthe relationship. But not for Priya and Kathryn. They continued to date. A few\nmonths later, they checked in again. “This time it was completely di\u0000erent. We\nboth felt like we could say, ‘Yes, this is a step toward getting married,’ ” Priya said.\nThey moved in together and got engaged the next year. Their wedding was a\ngiant family a\u0000air full of old friends, baby cousins, and rowdy aunts and uncles.\n“Now we handle every decision like that,” Priya told me. “What’s the point\nof rushing if you’re not headed in the same direction?”\nIn addition to discussing what moving in together means to you, I\nrecommend you talk about any fears or hesitations you have about this big\nchange. Your conversation can lead to clarity about more than just the question\nat hand. I worked with a client named Laura who was planning to move in with\nher boyfriend. He was warm and loving. He made her—a naturally anxious\nperson—feel content and calm. It was her \u0000rst long-term relationship in six\nyears, and she feared they might ruin things by moving in together too quickly.\nShe told me she tended to be the “CEO of the relationship.” She liked being in\ncontrol. But she worried that sharing a house would exacerbate this tendency\nand turn her into a nag. She’d seen that happen in her parents’ relationship and\nbelieved it was what had pushed her dad away from her mom.\n“My boyfriend works remotely, and I’m a corporate lawyer,” Laura said.\n“He’s a super-capable guy, but he doesn’t always do what he says he will, or at\nleast not in the time frame I want. I know it sounds terrible, but I’m just worried\n\f\nI’ll end up texting him nonstop with reminders to walk the dogs and pick up\ngroceries.”\nI coached her through a conversation with her boyfriend. I gave her advice on\nhow to bring up the conversation (tactfully), split their household duties\n(equally), and check in on the adjustment of moving in together (frequently).\nAnd Laura did, even though it was awkward and she risked hearing an answer\nshe didn’t want. Over burgers one night, Laura told him how it made her feel\nwhen she had to remind him about shared responsibilities. She expressed her fear\nthat she’d turn into a constant criticizer. He listened carefully and then confessed\nhis fear that she would feel resentful of him because he was paying only a small\nshare of the rent. They stayed up late talking about what was really going on for\nthem.\nThat weekend, they sat together and developed a system for managing\nhousehold tasks. They would keep a shared Google Calendar to add reminders\nand appointments. That way she could put a reminder on the calendar without\nhaving to feel like she was nagging him. And she promised never to hold the rent\nsituation over him. They’re now living together peacefully. Laura tells me their\ndogs get plenty of walks.\nEXERCISE: Get Aligned Before You Sign a Lease\nBefore you move in together, set aside a weekend to answer\nthese questions:\n1. Why are we moving in together?\n2. What does moving in together mean to you?\n3. Where do you see this relationship going in the future?\n4. Is marriage something we’re considering? If so, when do\nyou see us getting married?\n5. What are your fears about living together?"

I\nwas brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed. “Hello?” I said hesitantly,\nmouth full of spearmint foam.\nThe person on the other end burst into tears.\nI spit into the sink. “Who is this? What’s wrong?”\nAfter some sni\u0000ing and nose blowing, the voice said, “This is Sydney. I got\nyour number from our mutual friend, Hannah. It’s about my boyfriend.”\nI relaxed the death grip on my toothbrush. This I could handle. “What’s\nwrong?” I repeated. I could guess where the conversation was headed. He’d just\nbroken up with her and she needed support.\nShe took a deep breath, composed herself, and said, “He wants to propose to\nme!”\nA proposal. Not at all what I’d expected. “And why is this a bad thing?”\n“I think I need to break up with him.”\nI get calls like this all the time—okay, usually not at eleven p.m., and usually\nnot spoken through tears—from people of all ages, genders, and sexual\norientations. My work as a dating coach isn’t just about getting people into\nrelationships. It’s also about helping them leave bad ones.\nEvery step of a relationship requires conscious decision-making, from whom\nto go out with, to when to move in together, to whether or not to get married.\nAt some point, you may \u0000nd yourself right where Sydney was in that moment,\n\f\nconsidering one of the most pivotal decisions of all—whether to stay together or\nbreak up.\nI wish I could give you a quiz or a \u0000owchart that would magically reveal what\nto do. But I can’t. There’s no easy answer, and every situation is unique. I don’t\nknow all of the factors at play—how you think you feel, how you really feel,\nwhat else might be causing your discontent—and you probably don’t, either.\nHowever, I do know the cognitive forces at play that make this decision harder.\nUnderstanding them will help you decide what to do next.\nPeople who ask me for breakup consultations usually fall into one of two\ncategories. Some tend to stick around in relationships that aren’t working. I call\nthese people Hitchers. The other group consists of people who tend to leave\nrelationships too soon, without giving them a chance to grow—Ditchers. Of\ncourse, you may fall somewhere in the middle on the Bad Breakup Behavior\nSpectrum (not an o\u0000cial scienti\u0000c scale, but it should be). These tendencies wax\nand wane depending on whom we’re with, what’s going on in our lives, and\nmany other factors.\nDITCHING\nBefore I tell you what happened with Sydney, I want to introduce you to Mike.\nMike is thirty-six and lives in Albuquerque. When he \u0000rst contacted me, he\nexplained that he’d been seeing his girlfriend for around three months. She made\nhim happy. She called him on his bullshit. She helped him \u0000gure out what he\nwanted to do next after he’d been laid o\u0000. “She’s so incredibly kind,” he said,\n“maybe the kindest person I’ve ever met.”\nUnfortunately, for the last few weeks, he’d felt a familiar pull: He wanted to\nbreak up with her.\n“This is what I always do,” he explained. “I meet someone awesome, but after\nthree months, I start to \u0000xate on their \u0000aws, and then boom! I end it.”\n“What is it about your current girlfriend that’s bothering you now?” I asked.\n“I know this sounds snobby, but it’s the way she speaks. She misuses and\nmispronounces words. She says ‘pitcher’ instead of ‘picture.’ I think it’s a Boston\nthing.”"

He admitted that he usually had one foot out the door from the very\nbeginning. He tended to leave before giving his partner a fair chance (which\nundoubtedly a\u0000ected how he behaved in the relationship). He abandoned\nrelationships early because he always wondered if there was someone better out\nthere. And yes, if this sounds familiar, it’s because Mike was de\u0000nitely a\nMaximizer.\nFALLING VERSUS BEING IN LOVE\nSome Ditchers are motivated by their Maximizer tendencies. They leave\nrelationships too quickly because they believe they can \u0000nd something better.\nOthers ditch because of a Romanticizer tendency. They expect relationships\nwill always o\u0000er the exciting infatuation that abounds in the early stages—the\nfeeling of hearts \u0000uttering, palms sweating, minds racing. They end relationships\ntoo early because of a cognitive error called the transition rule.\nAs behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky explained,\nwhen we estimate how something will feel in the future, we tend to focus on the\ninitial impact. For example, you might imagine that lottery winners end up\nextremely happy, but it turns out that’s incorrect: As I mentioned earlier in the\nbook, a year after they win, lottery winners are about as happy (or unhappy) as\nnon–lottery winners.\nWhen imagining the lottery winner, we focus on that transition—going from\nbeing an average Joe to being a big winner. Now, that’s a huge change. But in\nreality, once you’re rich, you eventually adapt to your new circumstances, and\nsooner or later, the money doesn’t seem to hold as much intrigue. You go back\nto how you felt before the major event. (This dynamic unfolds in challenging\n\f\nsituations as well: Research shows that becoming a paraplegic has a smaller\nimpact on people’s long-term happiness than you might expect.)\nDitchers make the same mistake with love. Thanks to the transition rule, they\nconfuse falling in love with the state of being in love, and they expect the whole\nrelationship to o\u0000er that initial excitement. But people adapt. Being in love is less\nintense than falling into it. Which, by the way, seems like a good thing! How\ncould we get any work done with everyone walking around acting like the classic\ncartoon character Pepé Le Pew—smitten and speaking broken French?\nDitchers believe the feeling of falling in love will last forever. When they\nexperience that shift from falling to being, they interpret it as a mark of disaster\nfor their relationship. Over and over, they panic and leave, chasing the high of\nnew romance.\nWHAT’S WRONG WITH DITCHING?\nThis behavior causes problems, and not just for the person who gets dumped.\nDitchers underestimate the opportunity cost of leaving, never learning how to\nbe a good long-term partner.\nLet’s say you go on a hundred \u0000rst dates. You might develop excellent \u0000rst-\ndate skills. You discover the perfect cozy wine bar. Or you perfect the story of\nthat time you got lost backpacking in Nepal. But what happens on dates \u0000ve\nthrough seven? Or date twenty-\u0000ve? Or \u0000fty-\u0000ve? You don’t know, because you\nhaven’t gotten there. And if you keep dating people for three months and\nbreaking up with them, you’ll never get your reps in. You’ll lack the experience\nof truly getting to know someone, of seeing the face of the person you love lit up\nby birthday candles or streaked with tears because of a parent’s illness. And\nyou’ll continue to hold false expectations of how relationships feel over time.\nYou won’t learn that how you feel on day one di\u0000ers from how you feel on day\none thousand.\nWHAT CAN DITCHERS DO INSTEAD?\nOn the phone that day, I asked Mike to close his eyes.\n\f\n“Imagine you’re at a fork in the road,” I said. “There are two paths in front of\nyou. Now imagine you’re stepping out onto the \u0000rst path. You’ll break up with\nyour current girlfriend, \u0000nd another one, break up with her, and so on. This\npath is full of \u0000rst dates and \u0000rst kisses. It keeps going and going as you get older\nand older. There are nights out in Vegas and fancy restaurants, but no wife, no\nkids.\n“The other path holds something di\u0000erent for you. You commit to your\ngirlfriend. You do your best to make it work. As you walk along, you can see\nholiday dinners with both of your families. Look further ahead. You’ll see \u0000ghts,\nand makeup sex, and then a wedding, romantic trips, and then a baby, and then\nwiping poop from her forehead, and then passing out from exhaustion, and\nthen another baby, and more forehead-poop-wiping, and then college\ngraduation, and so on.”\nWhen I \u0000nished the exercise, Mike was quiet.\n“What’s on your mind?” I asked.\n“I need to think about it.”\nTwo weeks went by. During our next session, Mike spoke \u0000rst: “Last time I\nfeel like you showed me that I’m at a crossroads between Dad Mike and Sad\nMike. Sad Mike keeps dating women, breaking up with them, and repeating the\ncycle all over again. He never learns how to be in a relationship, and he never gets\nthe chance to have kids. When I closed my eyes, I saw him alone, living in a\nbachelor pad, with a pullout futon for a bed.”\n“So, what do you want to do about it?”\n“I’m ready to take a di\u0000erent path.”\nMike decided to give his relationship a chance. As we worked together over\nthe next year, he shifted his behavior and committed to his girlfriend. We\ndeveloped techniques to help him remind himself of her strengths. Every Sunday\nmorning, he’d send me \u0000ve things he’d appreciated about his girlfriend during\nthe previous week. (Don’t forget! I’m waiting for your email with the list of \u0000ve\nthings you liked about your date: 5goodthings@loganury.com.)\nIf you want to be in a long-term relationship, eventually you have to commit\nto someone and give it a try. When Mike gets the occasional itch for something\n\f\nnew, I reassure him that’s normal. He’s chosen the path toward Dad Mike, and\nthere’s nothing sad about it.\nHITCHERS\nWhile Ditchers can’t \u0000gure out how to stay in relationships, Hitchers struggle to\nleave them. Sydney, crying into the phone at eleven p.m., was a classic Hitcher.\n“I’m twenty-six,” Sydney said. She had been with her boyfriend, Mateo, for\nten years. “We’re from very small towns in Ohio, and we started dating at\nsixteen.”\nSydney felt she’d outgrown the relationship: “We both care for each other\ndeeply, but he’s no longer the person I want to share the details of my day with.\nWe don’t have anything to talk about. He brings out my most impatient, bratty\nside.”\n“How long have you been feeling this way?” I asked.\n“About three years, and it’s only gotten worse,” she said. “I know that in a\nlong relationship, you go through periods of ups and downs. But now that it’s\nbeen a few years, this feels like a major shift that needs to be addressed.”\nShe wondered aloud: “Should I listen to this voice telling me to break up\nwith him? Am I about to lose something good? I almost wish something\ndramatic would happen, like my work would transfer me to a di\u0000erent country\nwhere he couldn’t join me, so we’d be forced to reevaluate.”\nI knew it was time for the Wardrobe Test.\nIt’s a technique I developed while conducting research on breakups. Of all\nthe probing questions I ask, it’s the one that seems to help most.\nI’m going to tell you the question, but \u0000rst I want you to promise that, if\nyou’re considering a breakup, you’ll take a moment and answer this question for\nyourself as honestly (and quickly) as possible. We’re going for a gut reaction\nhere.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Take the Wardrobe Test\nIf your partner were a piece of clothing that you own—\nsomething in your closet—what piece of clothing would\nthey be?\n_________ _________ _________ _________\nThe question is abstract and absurd enough that it allows people to reveal\ntheir true feelings. Some people say their partner is a warm coat or a snuggly\nsweater. To me, this suggests that they \u0000nd their partner very supportive. One\nwoman said her boyfriend was her little black dress—something she felt sexy and\ncon\u0000dent in. One man said his girlfriend was like his favorite pair of loud pants\nhe wears to music festivals, which she’d given him as a gift. They’re an item he\nloves but never would have chosen for himself.\nOther people reveal how much frustration they feel about their relationship.\nOne guy said his boyfriend was a wool sweater, something that keeps you warm\nbut then gets itchy when you wear it too long.\nI asked Sydney the question.\n“Mateo is like that kind of scrubby old sweatshirt that you have that you love\nbut maybe wouldn’t wear to an important meeting,” she said. “When you put it\non, you’re like, ‘Ahhhh, yes. I’m in my element.’ But at the same time, ‘I’m not\ngoing to go anywhere looking like this.’ ”\nYikes. A scrubby old sweatshirt? A revealing answer if I’d ever heard one. It\nsuggested to me that she’d outgrown the relationship. That it was no longer\nsomething she was proud of or invested in. It was no longer the right\nrelationship for her—or Mateo.\nIt was time to take o\u0000 that sweatshirt and exit the relationship.\nWHY HITCHERS STICK AROUND"

    "raw_text": "There are several cognitive biases that help explain why Hitchers stay in\nrelationships too long.\nImagine this situation: You buy a ticket to an amateur improv show for\ntwenty-two dollars. You sit down, and within ten minutes, you can tell it’s not\nfor you. The improv is really amateur: I’m talking “Yes, and… no, thank you”\nbad.\nYou might say to yourself, I should stay. I paid twenty-two dollars. In that\nscenario, you’d sit through the show and spend ninety minutes doing something\nyou don’t enjoy. Or you could leave. You might choose to go for a walk or meet\nup with a friend who lives near the theater.\nIn both situations, you’ve spent twenty-two dollars on the tickets. The\nmoney is gone. But if you leave, at least you get your time back. Behavioral\neconomist Amos Tversky used to go to the movies, and if he didn’t enjoy the\n\u0000rst \u0000ve minutes of the \u0000lm, he’d leave. “They’ve already taken my money,” he\nexplained. “Should I give them my time, too?”\nTversky understood—and therefore tried to avoid—the sunk-cost fallacy.\nIt’s the feeling that once you invest in something, you should see it through. It\nexplains why most people force themselves to sit through a bad improv show.\nOr a bad relationship. The sunk-cost fallacy keeps Hitchers in relationships.\nOnce, a man called me and said, “I’ve spent three years with my girlfriend. The\n\u0000rst six months were great, the last two and a half years have been terrible.”\nWhen I asked why he was still with her when he was clearly unhappy, he\nresponded, “I’ve invested all this time with her. It would be dumb to quit now.”\nI explained the sunk-cost fallacy in terms I thought he’d appreciate: “The \u0000rst\nsix months of your relationship were like season one of True Detective—\nwonderful. Seasons two and three of the show were lackluster. Will you stick\naround and wait to see how season four turns out? Or is it time to start a new\nshow?” No matter what, he’d already dated her for three years. He needed to\ndecide: Did he want to date her for another three, or was he ready to \u0000nd a new\nshow?\nHitchers are also impacted by loss aversion. Behavioral economists Amos\nTversky and Daniel Kahneman identi\u0000ed this phenomenon in a seminal paper.\nThey explained that “losses loom larger than gains.”\n\f\nLet’s say you walk into a store to buy a new phone that costs $500. The\nsalesperson hands you a coupon for $100 o\u0000 your purchase. You’d be pretty\npumped, right? Now imagine a di\u0000erent scenario, where you walk into the store\nand the salesperson says they were running a $100 o\u0000 promotion, but it just\nended the day before. You’d feel some pain at that loss.\nIn one situation, you’re gaining $100, because the phone now costs $400\ninstead of $500. In the other situation, you’re losing $100, because you know\nyou just missed out on that coupon. Both involved $100, so you might expect to\nexperience equal amounts of pleasure and pain. But that’s not the case.\nRemember, losses loom larger than gains. Because of loss aversion, we experience\ntwice as much psychological pain from losing that $100 as we experience\npleasure from gaining $100. In other words, to feel the intensity of losing $100,\nyou’d have to gain $200.\nWe’ve learned to adapt our behavior to this cognitive bias: We do what we can\nto avoid losses. For our clothes, that means holding on to old T-shirts that we’d\nnever buy if we encountered them in a store today. In dating, that means holding\non to a bad relationship. We’re more terri\u0000ed of the potential loss of our partner\nthan intrigued by the potential gain of the person we could date instead.\nTHE PROBLEM WITH HITCHING\nBreaking up is a major decision, with major consequences, a decision you might\nbe tempted to delay. But what you don’t realize is that by staying in the\nrelationship, you are already making a decision.\nA breakup isn’t an exit ramp—it’s a T-shaped junction. To the left, Breakup\nPoint. To the right, Stay Together Mountain. No matter which direction, you’re\nmaking a choice.\nLike Ditchers, Hitchers underestimate opportunity cost. But Hitchers miss\nout on \u0000nding a new relationship. To extend my highway metaphor, the longer\nyou sit idling at the intersection, the longer it takes to get to your destination.\n(You’re also wasting gas, which is just so inappropriate. Climate change is real,\npeople!)\n\f\nBut here’s the worst thing: You’re not alone in the car. Your partner is with\nyou. If you’re planning on ending the relationship, every day you wait, you’re\nwasting their time, too. You should be especially sensitive if you’re dating a\nwoman who is hoping to give birth to her own kids. You’re underestimating her\nopportunity cost of being with you. The longer you put o\u0000 breaking up with\nher, the less time she has to \u0000nd a new partner and build a family. The kindest\nthing is to give her a clear answer so she can move on and \u0000nd someone else.\nSHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO?\nHopefully, you now have a good sense of whether you’re more of a Ditcher or a\nHitcher. But you might still be struggling to decide what to do next when it\ncomes to your relationship. Below is a series of questions that will help you\ndecide whether to end it or mend it. Carve out some time, make yourself some\ntea, and sit down with a journal to answer these questions.\n1. Take the Wardrobe Test: If your partner were a piece of clothing that you\nown—something in your closet—what piece of clothing would they be?\nHow to interpret your answer: Use this answer to understand how you view your\npartner and the relationship. As I mentioned, the abstract nature of this\nquestion helps reveal some underlying truths about our partnerships.\nInterpreting your answer will require you to analyze your own psyche. In\ngeneral, it bodes well for your relationship if the answer is a piece of outerwear,\nlike a sweater or jacket that keeps you warm, or a favorite shirt, pair of pants, or\nshoes. It’s worrisome if your item involves something that’s worn out, itchy, or\nuncomfortable, or something you don’t want to be seen wearing in public, like a\ntattered banana hammock.\n2. Are there extenuating circumstances going on in your partner’s life right now\n—like a new job or a sick parent—that make it hard for them to show up for\nyou the way you want them to? Is it possible that things will go back to normal\nwhen this situation is resolved?"

    "raw_text": "How to interpret your answer: Let’s say there’s an external situation—like a\ndemanding assignment at work—that’s causing your partner to be distracted,\nless present, less patient, or less giving. Yes, it’s useful to know how they respond\nto stress, but that doesn’t mean you should interpret their behavior as a sign of\nwho they are or how they’ll act throughout the relationship. Their behavior\nmight be temporary. Remember who they were before this happened. Can you\nride it out a little longer to see if they return to their normal behavior once the\nsituation is resolved?\n3. Have you tried to ﬁx things and given feedback?\nHow to interpret your answer: Imagine if you were \u0000red before you were told\nyour job was on the line. That would suck, wouldn’t it? That’s why a lot of\ncompanies have routine performance reviews. Regular check-ins give people an\nopportunity to improve. While your ex can’t sue you for breaking up without a\nheads-up, I don’t recommend this behavior. Give the person a chance to address\nwhatever is going on. Instead of bailing, face the challenge of talking to your\npartner and explain the changes you’d like to see in the relationship. (More in the\nnext chapter on how to navigate tough conversations like this one.)\n4. What are your expectations of a long-term relationship? Are they realistic?\nHow to interpret your answer: First, understand that no one is perfect, including\nyou, so stop being so freakin’ picky about tiny character \u0000aws! Those are pet\npeeves and not dealbreakers. Don’t be like the character Jerry on Seinfeld, the\nperpetual bachelor who breaks up with women because they have “man hands,”\n“shush” him, eat their peas one at a time, or enjoy a khakis commercial he\ndislikes.\nIf you’re a Romanticizer (look back to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher),\ncheck in on those expectations. Romanticizers tend to expect a happily ever after\nand then struggle when issues inevitably arise. They think, If this person were\nreally my soul mate, it wouldn’t be so hard. But all relationships go through\nperiods of highs and lows, and you’re better prepared to handle the low points if\nyou know they’re coming."

    "raw_text": "You may encounter a low when that initial infatuation fades. Our brain is on\nthis drug of love for the \u0000rst few years of a relationship. The next phase is more\nfamiliar, less intense. More “What can I pick you up from the grocery store?”\nand less “Let’s do it on the kitchen \u0000oor.” That change can feel disappointing;\nsome people try to recapture the rapture by starting over with someone else.\nHowever, if your goal is to be in a long-term relationship with a committed\npartner, understand that the shift is more or less inevitable. You can keep chasing\nthe new-relationship high, but the dynamic always changes eventually.\n5. Finally, it’s time to look at who you’ve been in the relationship. You are half\nof the dynamic. Are you bringing your best self to the partnership? Are you\ndoing everything you can on your end to make it work? Can you work on\nbeing a more generous, present partner?\nHow to interpret your answer: Don’t just focus on your partner’s \u0000aws. Look at\nyourself, too. If there’s more you can do to make the relationship work, perhaps\nby being kinder, try that before you pull the plug. If it turns out that you’ve been\nbringing your best self to others (work and friends and family) and leaving your\npartner with the scraps, see what your relationship feels like when you invest in it\n\u0000rst. Check out Chapter 18 for tips on how to make a long-term relationship\nwork.\nASK A TRUSTED FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER\nIf you’re still struggling to decide whether you should stay in a relationship, it\nmay be time to phone a friend. You’ll likely need to ask for feedback outright.\nEtiquette dictates that we keep our mouths shut about other people’s\nrelationships, even when we notice red \u0000ags, so most people won’t o\u0000er this kind\nof feedback without being called on \u0000rst. As my dad says, “I’m part of the\nwelcoming committee, not the hiring committee.” But our friends and family\ncan see things that we’re blind to. That’s because we’re infatuated with our\npartners during the \u0000rst two to three years we’re together, which turns us into\npoor judges of our own relationships.\n\f\nA friend of mine called o\u0000 her wedding a few weeks before the big day. At\nthat point, several people confessed they’d had doubts about her ex-\u0000ancé but\ndidn’t want to o\u0000er unsolicited advice.\nDon’t let that happen to you. Ask a trusted friend or family member what\nthey really think about your relationship. Choose your adviser wisely. This\nshould be someone who knows you and your partner well, has your best\ninterests at heart, and is good at helping you think through decisions. Avoid\npeople who might project their own issues onto your situation (read: have trust\nissues after being cheated on), who might want you to be single or in a\nrelationship because of how it a\u0000ects their lives (read: want you to go on double\ndates with them or serve as their wingperson), or who are in love with you and\ntherefore can’t give impartial feedback!\nTell them that you feel bad putting them in an awkward situation, but you\nreally need an honest opinion. A woman I know named Meredith has a contract\nwith her best friend that if either of them is dating someone the other thinks is\nnot a good match, they will call it out, no matter how hard it is to have that\nconversation.\nHonor your commitment not to hold the advice against your friend or family\nmember, even if you decide not to follow it. Please don’t punish someone for\ngiving honest, solicited feedback! And if they resist having the conversation,\ndon’t force it.\nIn the end, the decision is still yours. But what did you learn from discussing\nit with a trusted con\u0000dant? Did they con\u0000rm your fears? Did they advise you to\nstick it out? Often it’s as useful to pay attention to your reaction to the advice as\nit is to receive the advice itself. How did you feel when they shared their\nthoughts? Relieved? Panicked? Use this experience to tune in to your own\nfeelings about what to do next.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT\nIf you’re a Ditcher who has given this relationship a chance and it just\nisn’t working: Leave the relationship. Maybe this just isn’t the person for you,\nand that’s okay."

    "raw_text": "But you’re not o\u0000 the hook yet. It’s important that you keep your Ditcher\ntendency in mind. The next time you’re in a relationship and you feel that\nfamiliar urge to leave, I want you to revisit the questions above and make sure\nyou’re bidding adieu for the right reasons.\nIf you’re a Ditcher or a Hitcher who hasn’t given the relationship a real\nchance (for example, you haven’t brought your best self to it): Stay in the\nrelationship and see what happens when you’re patient and invested.\nRelationships go through natural ups and downs over time. The longer the\nrelationship, the more likely it is that there will be periods—perhaps even several\nyears—when relationship satisfaction dips. It’s important to recognize that often\na low point isn’t a breaking (or breakup) point.\nIn his book, The All-or-Nothing Marriage, Northwestern professor Eli Finkel\nsuggests that couples learn to recalibrate their expectations during a\nrelationship’s downturn. Downturns can happen for a number of reasons—\nperhaps because of demands from young children, aging parents, or a stressful\njob. While some marriage experts might tell you that when things are rough in\nyour relationship, you need to invest more time and energy to make it work,\nthat’s often unrealistic. When you’re depleted, there’s not much left to give.\nInstead, ask less from your relationship—temporarily—while you sort out other\nparts of your life.\nFocus on yourself \u0000rst. We’re most able to love when we feel complete. The\nmore con\u0000dent and comfortable we feel about ourselves, the easier it is to give\nand share with others. If you can work on making yourself happy \u0000rst, instead of\nexpecting it to come from someone else, your relationships will be easier.\nWhile the idea of couples therapy might seem scary, you may want to\nconsider it, even if you’re not married. There’s a misconception that if a\nrelationship needs therapy, it’s too late to save it. No! Give it a chance. According\nto relationship scientist John Gottman, despite there being almost a million\ndivorces in the United States every year, fewer than 10 percent of these couples\never talk to a professional. Couples therapy has been studied and validated over\nthe past few decades. Who knows how many of those couples may have been\nable to save their relationship if they’d received professional support?\n\f\nI feel comfortable giving you this advice because of my own experience\nchoosing to stay.\nA few years ago, I sat with Scott at a fancy restaurant in New York. A waiter\nappeared at our table, o\u0000ering a basket full of bread rolls just pulled from the\noven. I picked one out and carved out a heap of cultured butter, \u0000ecked with sea\nsalt.\n“What have you been up to at work?” I asked Scott.\nAt the time, we’d been dating for three years and living together in San\nFrancisco for one. I’d moved to New York temporarily to participate in the four-\nmonth TED Residency. He’d surprised me with this dinner to celebrate the end\nof the program. It was a grand gesture, and one I appreciated, because we were\nnot doing well.\nOur relationship had been shaky since January, turned upside down by\nseveral big changes in my life. After almost a decade in the corporate world, I’d\nquit my job to pursue my passion. I’d gone from earning a tech salary to earning\nno salary, and from working in an o\u0000ce with thousands of people to working\nalone from a di\u0000erent city.\nWe’d had several long, di\u0000cult conversations. I stated my values that I felt\nweren’t being met (community, friends, travel) and asked him to put more e\u0000ort\ninto those areas of our lives. We even went to a terrible couples therapist who\nquoted his own lame Facebook posts and suggested that we, neurotic Jews,\nshould start doing extreme sports together to reconnect. Ironically, we bonded\nover our mutual dislike of him.\nDuring one of those challenging conversations, Scott mentioned that I never\nseemed to listen to him when he talked about work. “You think what I do is\nboring,” he said. “It’s not. We’re trying to help save women’s lives by improving\nbreast cancer screening.”\nHe was right. I’d never really understood what he did. Though I worked in\ntech, I’m not a particularly technical person; I can barely work my DSLR\ncamera. When people asked me about Scott’s job in arti\u0000cial intelligence at\nGoogle, I usually replied with a word salad of “machine learning,” “computer\nvision,” and “medical imaging” until they nodded sympathetically and the\nconversation moved on.\n\f\nFinally, the four months of long distance were over. Scott had \u0000own across\nthe country to see my TED Talk, which focused on romantic relationships. The\nirony wasn’t lost on me that I was trying to help others create lasting love while\nmy own relationship faltered.\nHe’d taken me to that fancy restaurant to celebrate. In that moment, I \u0000nally\ndecided to learn what he did for a living.\nHe provided the basics of his job—what he did and how it had the potential\nto advance the practice of radiology. I sat there, listening to him explain the\nintricacies of his role on the mammography team, and I felt proud of him. I\nwondered why I’d never cared to ask him about his work before.\nPrior to that dinner, I’d spent many hours alone and with friends, wondering\nif we should break up. I’d gone through all of the exercises and anguish I\ndescribed above.\nBut that night, when I really re\u0000ected on my behavior, I realized how much\nI’d asked him to change for our relationship without being willing to put in the\nwork myself.\nThe work: paying attention, asking questions, listening. Prior to that dinner,\nI was guilty of the critique in that old saying: “The shoemaker’s children go\nbarefoot.” In my quest to help others with their relationships, I’d forsaken my\nown.\nDuring dinner, I made an impassioned e\u0000ort to connect with Scott about his\njob. I opened the door, and he walked through it. What followed was one of the\nbest conversations of our relationship.\nI see that dinner as the turning point in our partnership, the moment when I\nrealized I’d been taking him for granted and prioritizing my work, emails, and\ndating coaching clients over him.\nWhile things weren’t easy, they got better. I put in more e\u0000ort and paid more\nattention to Scott. And Scott committed to getting to know more of my friends,\ninvesting more in our community, and being more proactive about travel. We\nmade our relationship a bigger priority in our lives. We tended to it. We \u0000xed it\ninstead of giving up on it.\n\f\nIf you’re a Hitcher who has given this relationship a chance and it just\nisn’t working: Leave the relationship. It’s going to be painful for both of you,\nbut it’s time to move on.\nWhy spend more weeks or months or even years of your life in a relationship\nthat isn’t working? I believe there’s a ful\u0000lling partnership waiting for you out\nthere, but you have to say goodbye to this relationship so you can say hello to\nthat one.\nUltimately, that’s what Sydney decided she needed to do. A few months after\nour call, I asked her if we could meet up in San Francisco.\nWe decided to meet up for vegan Mexican food. I arrived at the restaurant\nearly, excited to \u0000nally meet her in person. Soon a blond woman in a bright\nyellow raincoat approached me. As I stuck out my hand, she pulled me into a big\nhug. “Thank you,” she whispered.\nLater, as we dug into our chips and salsa, she caught me up on her love life.\n“The day after you and I spoke, I just couldn’t stop thinking about how I’d\ncalled Mateo a scrubby old sweatshirt,” she said. “I knew I had to break up with\nhim.” A few weeks later, she did. “Getting out of the relationship felt like taking\no\u0000 a heavy coat—or I guess a scrubby old sweatshirt—that had been weighing\nme down.”\nI nodded. I was proud to hear that she’d made a decision and stuck to it.\nSeveral months later, Sydney met another guy while in New York. He was the\nopposite of Mateo. Ambitious, worldly—and constantly challenging her. He\nsoon moved to San Francisco to be with her. Later that year, she emailed me\nwith an update: “I am in a beautiful and healthy relationship with someone I\nadore. And you helped me \u0000nd the courage to make that happen.”\nThe decision to stay or leave, end it or mend it, is challenging. But if you’re\ncon\u0000dent you want to break up, it’s vital you take the other person’s feelings\ninto consideration when you do it. Read the next chapter for tips on how to\nclose the relationship with compassion."

Ditchers leave relationships too quickly, without giving them\na chance to develop.

They underestimate the opportunity cost of\nlearning how to make relationships work.\n3. Hitchers stay in relationships too long. Hitchers are affected\nby cognitive biases like the sunk-cost fallacy (continuing to\ninvest in something because you’ve already dedicated a lot of\nresources to it) and loss aversion (our tendency to try and\navoid losses because we experience them as particularly\npainful). Hitchers forgo the opportunity to ﬁnd a more\nsatisfying partnership.\n4. To ﬁgure out whether to stay or go, consider your historical\ntendencies and determine if you’ve given the relationship a\nfair chance.

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 15\nMAKE A BREAKUP PLAN\nHow to Break Up with Someone\nWhen I set out to help people \u0000nd love and build lasting relationships, I never\nimagined that work would include “breakup consulting.” I know the idea of\nworking with someone to plan a breakup sounds odd, but I’ve come to see it as\none of the most important parts of my job. In order to create the partnership of\ntheir dreams, people may \u0000rst need to exit a middling or bad relationship. And I\nhelp them do that.\nOften, even though people have decided they want to end things, they\nstruggle to do it. They’re afraid of the di\u0000cult conversation, of hurting their\npartner, and of being alone. Their goal is to break up, but they spend months or\neven years hesitating. Researchers have dedicated a lot of time exploring the best\ntechniques to help people accomplish their goals. That’s why—as awkward as it\nmay seem—it’s useful to apply goal-setting research here.\nWhen people don’t execute on their goals, it’s usually because they’re missing\na plan. For example, economist Annamaria Lusardi and her team researched how\na company could get more employees to set up and maintain an employer-\nsponsored savings plan. They provided a planning aid for new hires. This\nwritten aid suggested the new employees set aside a speci\u0000c time to enroll in the\nsavings plan, laid out the exact steps to enroll, provided estimates of how long\neach step would take, and o\u0000ered advice on what to do if you got stuck. This aid\nraised enrollment rates in the plan by 12 percentage points to 21.\nConsider this your breakup-planning aid. I’ll explain the steps to take as well\nas the research backing them up. Note: This plan is for people who are in a\nrelationship but aren’t married and don’t have kids together. For people in that\n\f\nsituation, your breakup entails far more logistics, such as how to manage divorce\nor custody agreements. This plan doesn’t address all of those complexities. And\nif you’ve been out on only a few dates, the steps outlined below will be overkill.\nInstead, send a short text to thank the other person but let them know you’re\nnot interested, or call the other person to break the news. (Check out the anti-\nghosting sidebar in Chapter 12 for tips on what to say.)\nStep 1: Record your reasons for wanting the breakup.\nMotivation isn’t constant. We experience what behavioral scientist and Stanford\nprofessor BJ Fogg calls “motivation waves”—our motivation ebbs and \u0000ows.\nDuring moments of peak motivation, we’re able to do really hard things we\ncouldn’t have accomplished otherwise. The trick is to take action at this time.\nFor example, if there’s a hurricane scare in your town, it may give you the\nmotivation you need to get storm shutters for your home.\nIf you’re feeling ready to break up with someone, you’re likely experiencing\npeak motivation. It’s going to get you through the \u0000rst bit—actually breaking\nup—but your motivation will likely decline later, when you might wonder if\nyou’ve made a huge mistake. With that in mind, I want you to capture your\nfeelings during this peak so you can steel yourself later on, when motivation\ndrops.\nWrite yourself a letter about why you’ve chosen to end things. In a few weeks,\nwhen you’re horny or lonely (or, in extreme cases, “hornly”) or want someone to\nfeed your rabbit during a trip, you’ll remember exactly why you made this\ndi\u0000cult decision.\nHere’s a letter written by one of my clients:\nWhen I lie in bed at night next to him I feel like I’m lying to myself. He’s\nnot nice to me. I treat him like a priority and he treats me like an option.\nHe lets me down, and he doesn’t care about my friends. I’m attracted to\nhim and we have fun together but that’s not enough. I can’t keep\npretending that I am okay being #5 on his priority list after his job, going\nto the gym, swimming, and riding his bike. I want a relationship that feels\nlike we’re both giving. I’ll miss him and I’ll miss the great sex but I am"

    "raw_text": "doing this because I really believe I deserve something more than what he\ncan give me right now.\nNow it’s your turn.\nEXERCISE: Record Your Reasons for the Breakup\nIn a notebook, write yourself a letter explaining why you’re\nmaking the decision.\nStep 2: Make a plan.\nResearch from psychology professor Gail Matthews showed that participants\nwho wrote down their goals, de\u0000ned their action plan, and provided weekly\nprogress updates to a friend were 33 percent more likely to achieve their goals\nthan those who did not take those actions.\nYou’ve already written out the reasons you want to go through with the\nbreakup, painful and scary as it might be. It’s time to pull o\u0000 the Band-Aid.\nOnce you’ve decided to do it, stop delaying it. Throughout this book, I’ve\ndiscussed the power of deadlines, especially short ones. This advice holds true for\nbreakups. Set a deadline for yourself so you actually get it done. I recommend\nclients set a deadline that’s within the next two weeks. It’s enough time to\nprepare, and to ride that motivation wave, but not enough time to chicken out.\nEXERCISE: Set a Clear Deadline\nI commit to having this conversation by:________\n\f\nOnce you’ve set your deadline, it’s time to make a more speci\u0000c plan for\nwhen and where you’ll have the breakup conversation. Research from David W.\nNickerson of the University of Notre Dame and Todd Rogers of Ideas42, a\nnonpro\u0000t dedicated to social science research, demonstrates the power of\nmaking a plan for when and where we’ll act. They asked people in single-voter\nhouseholds speci\u0000c questions about their plan for voting. For example: “Around\nwhat time do you expect to head to the polls on Tuesday?” “Where do you\nexpect you will be coming from when you head to the polls on Tuesday?” and\n“What do you think you will be doing before you head out to the polls?” It\nturned out that the people in single-voter households who were asked those\nquestions were 9 percent more likely to show up to vote than those who hadn’t\nbeen asked those questions. Merely being prompted to make a plan made a\ndi\u0000erence!\nNot only does having a speci\u0000c plan make you more likely to follow through\non the breakup conversation, it’s also a way to make sure you’re being as\ncompassionate as possible to your partner during this di\u0000cult moment.\nChoose a quiet location, preferably your home or your partner’s. Don’t break\nup with someone in public. I see that as a weaselly attempt to ensure the other\nperson doesn’t make a scene. You know what? Maybe they will! It’s your right to\nbreak up with them, and it’s their right to have a strong emotional response to\nthat action.\nConsider your timing. You’re about to detonate a bomb in someone else’s\nlife. You know this is coming; they don’t. Don’t break up with someone the day\nbefore they have to take a big exam, or give a presentation, or interview for a new\njob. One of my clients planned to break up with his girlfriend on a Saturday\nnight at six p.m. They had committed to attending her niece’s recital at seven\np.m. that night. That’s not fair. Understand that the breakup will likely derail\nthe night, their weekend, and beyond, so choose your timing carefully.\nAnother client realized her girlfriend had a big presentation the following\nMonday, so she decided not to break up with her that weekend. They had the\nconversation the following Friday night, after she’d given the presentation. This\ngave her the full weekend to start the recovery process. (Flip ahead to the next\n\f\nchapter for tips on getting over a breakup—this can help you keep your soon-to-\nbe ex’s needs reasonably in mind.)\nDelay within reason. Don’t push back the conversation for months if your\npartner has a super-stressful job with nonstop important meetings, but don’t be\na dick.\nEXERCISE: Commit to a Speciﬁc and Thoughtful Time for\nthe Conversation\nI’m going to do it on_________ _________ _________ _\nbecause\n_________ _________ _________ _________\n(For example: I’m going to do it Friday night after his big\npresentation next week, because that gives him the weekend to\nrecover.)\nOnce you’ve decided when and where you’ll initiate the breakup, you’ll want\nto make a plan for what you’re going to say. How do you want to start? I suggest\nyou emphasize that you’ve given this decision deep consideration and you want\nto end the relationship. Be compassionate but direct.\nYou could say something like: “I really care about you, and I don’t want to\nhurt you, but I think we need to break up. We both know this relationship\nhasn’t been working for a while. We tried to make it better, but at this point, I\ndon’t think we can make the changes we need to. I want us to both \u0000nd love and\nbe happy, but I don’t think this relationship is going to give us that.”\nAnother example of an opener: “I need to talk to you. I love you, and I love so\nmany aspects of our relationship, but I’m not happy, and I don’t know that you\nare, either. This is insanely hard to say, because I don’t want to hurt you. I’m so\n\f\ngrateful for the time we’ve had together, but after giving it a lot of thought, I\ndon’t think we should be together.”\nObviously your partner will be hurt. That’s unavoidable. Do your best to\nmake them feel better. But if they say, “What’s wrong with me?” don’t answer.\nHere’s why: They’re the wrong person for you, but there’s nothing inherently\n“wrong” with them, and even if there is, you’re not in a position to say that.\nYou’re a very biased source at this point. You’ve just convinced yourself to dump\nthis person. You can share reasons why you don’t want to stay together—for\nexample, you bring out an anxious side of each other, \u0000ght all the time, or\nrepeatedly asked the other person to work on certain issues in the relationship\nand they refused—but you’re not the ultimate authority on what’s “good” and\n“bad” about them. The same advice holds if they ask what they did wrong. This\nis a breakup, not a feedback session. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, it’s\nyour responsibility to bring up any issues and try to address them before you\ndecide to end things.\nThis helps protect the person from unnecessary pain during the recovery\nperiod. Know that whatever you say is likely what they’ll \u0000xate on after the\nbreakup because of something called the narrative fallacy. Our brain tries to\ncreate a cause-and-e\u0000ect story to explain the events we witness and experience,\neven when that story is false. Any breakup is likely a response to a whole number\nof situations and dynamics, but when you end things with someone and give a\nspeci\u0000c reason for doing it, they’ll obsess over that reason. Don’t plant that\nunhelpful seed in their mind.\nI had a client whose boyfriend broke up with her because he “didn’t like her\nsmell.” Yes, pheromones are real, and yes, scientists have shown that people often\nprefer the pheromones of someone who’s the most genetically di\u0000erent from\nthem, which is evolutionarily bene\u0000cial since it gives future o\u0000spring the most\ngenetically diverse immune system and a greater chance at survival. But when the\nwoman heard this critique of how she smelled, she was not thinking about her\no\u0000spring—heck, they’d been dating only six months. Instead, she freaked out\nthat she smelled bad! She changed her deodorant. And her body lotion. And got\na pap smear. She even had her gut bacteria tested! I tried to tell her that she\n\f\ndidn’t smell bad. But once she’d gotten it in her head that her smell was why he’d\nbroken up with her, she couldn’t stop focusing on it as the reason.\nIf you \u0000nd yourself put on the spot, say something about the fact that you\nrespect them, and you don’t think this will work long term, so you don’t want to\nwaste their time.\nIt’s tempting to want to stay and o\u0000er the other person support. Or you may\nfeel like it’s your responsibility to answer every single question. However,\nmarathon discussions detailing everything you both felt went wrong in the\nrelationship are not useful. You don’t want this meeting to cause you to say\nsomething hurtful. Therefore, I want you to set a time limit on the \u0000rst\nconversation. Talk for an hour, maybe ninety minutes, and then end the\nconversation. Now, I don’t recommend telling your soon-to-be ex, “We have an\nhour to talk, and that’s it.” And you certainly don’t want to use a stopwatch to\ntime yourself. But don’t let the conversation drag on forever. Tell them you can\ntalk again the next day if needed. If you’ve been dating for a long time or there\nare complicated logistics to work out, these conversations may unfold over a\nseries of days.\nTo help you express yourself as clearly and compassionately as possible, plan\nout the conversation with my Critical Conversation Planning Doc. Below, you’ll\nsee how my clients have used it before a breakup. I’ve included a blank one in the\nAppendix. It’s useful for preparing for all types of tough conversations, not just\nbreakups.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Critical Conversation Planning Doc\n1. What’s your goal for this conversation? (In other\nwords, what does success look like?)\nWe both get to express how we’re feeling, she feels heard,\nand it’s clear we’re broken up.\n2. What’s the core message you want to communicate?\nI’ve given this a lot of thought, and I really care about\nyou as a person, but I don’t think this is the right\nrelationship for me.\n3. What tone do you want to use? What tone do you want\nto avoid?\nCalm, compassionate, caring. I want to avoid sounding\ndefensive or callous.\n4. How do you want to open the conversation?\n“I trust this won’t come as a surprise to you, because in\nthe past few months, we’ve both shared that we aren’t\nfeeling happy. I’ve given it a lot of thought, and even\nthough I care deeply about you, I don’t think this is the\nright relationship for me, and I think we should break up.”\n5. What needs to be said?\n“Thank you for supporting me during my job\ntransition, for being so kind to my family, and for\nteaching me so much about the world.”\n“I’ve been feeling unsure about this for a while. I did a\nlot of soul-searching, and I don’t think this is the right\n\f\nrelationship for me.”\n“We’ve been ﬁghting a lot lately, and I don’t like the\nside of myself that the relationship brings out.”\n“We’ve done the work to see if we can save this\nrelationship, and I believe it’s best for both of us if we\nend it.”\n6. What are your concerns about how the other person\nwill react?\nShe will ask me exactly what she did wrong or she will\nsay mean things to me.\n7. What will you do if that happens?\nIf she asks what she did wrong: “This isn’t about\nanything you did or about who you are. It’s about\nwhat we create when we’re together. I don’t feel like\nthis relationship brings out the best side of me. You\ndidn’t do anything wrong, and I don’t want you to\nblame yourself.”\nIf she says mean things to me: “I understand that\nyou’re mad and I’ve hurt you, so now you want to hurt\nme. You have every right to be upset, but I don’t want\nthis to be more painful for us than it has to be. Please\ndon’t attack me.”\n8. How do you want to close the conversation?\nI’ll repeat some of my points, thank her for the time we\nhad together, and oﬀer to text her brother to ask him to\ncome check on her when I leave. No sex!\nYou can also ask a friend to help you practice what you’re going to say. (I\nalways role-play breakups with my clients, even though they \u0000nd it awkward to"

Practice might not make\nperfect, but this pre-work will help you select the right words in the moment.\nStep 3: Create a social accountability system with a friend.\nYou’ve got a speci\u0000c deadline in mind, and now you know what you’re going to\nsay, and when and where you’re going to say it. How do you make sure you go\nthrough with it? Increase your chances of following through by setting up a\nsocial accountability system. With this technique, you ask others to hold you\nresponsible to the goal you’ve set for yourself.\nAccountability works so well because many of us are what best-selling author\nGretchen Rubin calls “obligers.” We easily meet expectations set by others but\nstruggle to uphold our own. That’s why you may often miss goals you set for\nyourself (like exercising more) but don’t miss appointments for someone else\n(like picking up a friend’s child from school). If you involve a friend, you make\nthis goal about committing to them, not just to yourself.\nFind a trusted friend (someone who doesn’t like your current partner may be\nespecially enthusiastic about helping you). Make a commitment to contact them\nafter your breakup conversation. If you want to take your accountability system\nto the next level, incorporate incentives. Behavioral scientists love to use positive\nincentives or negative incentives to change how people act. For example, one of\nmy clients wrote a check for $10,000 to the presidential campaign of a candidate\nhe strongly opposed. He gave his friend permission to mail it in if he missed the\ndeadline to break up with his girlfriend.\nHe broke up with her later that day.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Design Your Accountability System\nMy accountability partner is:_________ _________ _____\nI promise to_________ _________ _________ __\n_________ _________ ____ if I don’t meet my deadline.\n(For example: My accountability partner is Seth. I promise to\npublicly post my last three porn searches if I don’t meet my\ndeadline.)\nStep 4: Have the conversation, but don’t have sex!\nWe’ve arrived at the hardest part: breaking up. Remember all the things you did\nto prepare and plan, and don’t forget to limit the conversation on day one and\ncontinue it later if needed.\nThroughout the conversation, check in with both yourself and the other\nperson to avoid \u0000ooding. This is a physical and mental state when your cortisol\n—stress hormone—rises and your body enters \u0000ght-or-\u0000ight mode. It helped\nour ancestors when they were at risk of being killed by a tiger, but it’s de\u0000nitely\nnot the right mental setting for a crucial conversation. When we \u0000ood, we’re not\nable to really listen or take in new information. If either of you feels like you’re\nstarting to \u0000ood, take a twenty-minute time-out to calm down. Return to the\nconversation with your original objective in mind. Be kind but \u0000rm. Your goal is\nthat by the end of the conversation, it’s clear you’ve broken up.\nAfter the breakup, please, please, please don’t have sex!!! Maybe you don’t\nthink I need to say this. But trust me, I’ve heard about enough breakups to\nknow otherwise. Breakup sex is fun, but it’s not worth it. It introduces a lot of\nconfusing feelings. That’s especially true if you haven’t had sex in a while, and\nthe intense emotions of the breakup propel you into bed. Plus, sleeping with"

    "raw_text": "someone makes it harder to stick to your resolution to break up, so you may end\nup taking back what you said. That only complicates the process.\nTo avoid making this mistake, set up a Ulysses Contract or a pre-\ncommitment device. In Homer’s epic tale The Odyssey, Captain Ulysses knows\nhis crew will be sailing past the enchanting Sirens. He’s heard about their\ncaptivating song, which causes sailors to redirect their ships and crash into their\nshores. Rather than depend on his own willpower, he makes a plan. He directs\nhis crew to tie him to the mast of his ship so he can’t change course. He tells his\nsailors to put wax in their ears so they won’t be able to hear the song. He\nprotects himself from temptation by making a plan in advance.\nBehavioral scientists design Ulysses Contracts, too, as a way to help people\navoid temptation. Economist Nava Ashraf and her team tested this approach in\na study at a local bank in the Philippines. Some clients voluntarily opted into a\nprogram that restricted their ability to withdraw from their savings account until\na certain date or until they’d reached a certain savings goal. They set the dates\nand goals on their own. Other clients were not o\u0000ered this program and could\nwithdraw their money at any time. After twelve months, those who had pre-\ncommitted had bank balances that were 81 percent higher.\nAfter the breakup, you’re vulnerable to temptation. The metaphorical Sirens\nmay be calling you to bed with your ex-partner. Set up a Ulysses Contract by\nmaking plans for immediately after the breakup conversation, and create an\naccountability system to hold you to it. One of my clients worried he would\nsleep with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend. He made sure he didn’t by promising to\npick up a friend from the airport shortly after the conversation. This was\nsomething he absolutely could not miss, and he didn’t.\nStep 5: Make an immediate post-breakup plan for yourself.\nEven if you’re not tempted to sleep with your ex, you’ll likely experience some\npretty intense feelings after your breakup. You might feel relieved. And sad. In\nany case, it’s helpful to make a post-breakup plan to keep you from making\ndecisions that you’ll end up regretting.\n\f\nFigure out in advance what you’re going to do after the breakup, including\nwhere you’re going. Don’t commit to any demanding plans. Perhaps you can go\nto a friend’s house, order in your favorite food, and rewatch The Sopranos from\nthe beginning. Ideally, this is a friend who will either distract you or help you\nprocess your feelings. I don’t recommend being alone those \u0000rst few nights.\nFeeling lonely and uncertain makes you more likely to slide back into the\nrelationship.\nNote: If you and your now ex lived together, this post-breakup plan is\nespecially important. Ask a friend if you can stay with them for at least a few\ndays.\nEXERCISE: Make a Plan for the First Few Days\nDirectly after the breakup, I’m going to head to:\n_________ _________ _________ _________\nDuring the ﬁrst few days, I’m going to do these activities:\n_________ _________ _________ _________\n(For example: Directly after the breakup, I’m going to head to: my\nsister’s house. During the ﬁrst few days, I’m going to do these\nactivities: watch the British version of The Oﬃce, go to restorative\nyoga, make a lot of smoothies.)\nStep 6: Create a Breakup Contract with your ex.\nAfter your initial breakup conversation, your ex may want to talk again. Agree to\nspeak, but remember Steps 1 through 3.\nIt’s important to have a plan for yourself. But you also need to make a plan\nwith your ex. Research shows if someone actively chooses to do something, they\n\f\nfeel more involved in the process and more invested in the outcome. Social\nscientists Delia Cio\u0000 and Randy Garner demonstrated this e\u0000ect by asking\ncollege student volunteers to help out with an AIDS education project at nearby\nschools. Half the students were told that if they wanted to volunteer, they\nshould \u0000ll out a form stating their interest. The other half were given a form and\ntold to leave it blank if they wanted to volunteer. They were instructed to \u0000ll it\nout only if they were not interested in volunteering. Both groups signed up to\nvolunteer at roughly the same rate. But the researchers saw a meaningful\ndi\u0000erence in who actually showed up. Those in the passive condition, who\nsigned up by not \u0000lling out the form? Only 17 percent showed up. Of those in\nthe active condition, who had to \u0000ll out the form, 49 percent upheld their\ncommitment: almost three times as many as the other group. When you actively\nagree to do something, you feel like the decision is yours, and you see it as a\nre\u0000ection of your own preferences and ideals. This doesn’t happen when you\npassively commit. That’s why making a plan with your ex will help you both feel\na little better about an otherwise painful process. I’ve created a Breakup\nContract to help.\nWhoa—did she just say “contract”?\nYes, I did. I know it seems a little out there, but a few years ago I was struck by\nCio\u0000 and Garner’s research, and the power of active commitment. I wrote the\ncontract to help friends navigate a tricky breakup. Since then, several thousand\ncouples around the world have accessed the online version of my contract, and\nI’ve received dozens of emails from people about how it helped them manage the\nend of their relationship. (As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter,\nbreakups are much more complicated if you’re married and/or have kids\ntogether. This Breakup Contract is designed for pre-marriage, no-kids\nrelationships.)\nIntroduce the idea by saying something like: “I know this sounds ridiculous,\nbut I think it might be helpful if we get on the same page about what we both\nwant moving forward. Are you willing to take a look at this with me?”\nYou don’t have to agree on every point, and you likely won’t. But the contract\nis a great way to get a tough conversation going while \u0000guring out what would"

    "raw_text": "Want to watch “our show” (the TV program\nI used to share with my ex)\n \n   \n   \n   \nStep 8: Don’t be the “Nice Breakup Person.”\nThe aftermath of a breakup, even if it’s one you wanted, isn’t easy. You might\nhave some moments of doubt, fear, or uncertainty. Just because you initiated the\nbreakup doesn’t mean you’re not in pain. I’ll cover more about how to get over\nheartbreak in the next chapter, but here’s some advice that’s written speci\u0000cally\nfor the person who asked for the breakup.\nFor a while, you may experience a roller coaster of emotions, from extreme\nrelief to extreme regret. “Why did I do this?” or “Am I going to die alone?” If\nthat happens, return to the external accountability system you created at the\nbeginning of the process. Revisit the letter you wrote about why you did it. Ask\nthe friend who helped you role-play the conversation to remind you why you did\nit.\nYou might also be feeling guilty for hurting someone you care about. Even if\nthat happens, resist the urge to check in on your ex too much, especially in the\n\u0000rst few weeks after a breakup. When I spoke to author and philosopher Alain\nde Botton, he gave the same advice: “There’s a terrible phenomenon of the Nice\nBreakup Person. We hear a lot about the horrible breakup person, but we don’t\nhear so much about the nice person who stays around, who keeps calling you on\nyour birthday, etc.”\nDon’t be the Nice Breakup Person. You’re not actually being nice. In many\ncases, your behavior is more about helping yourself than helping the other\nperson. “Have the courage to assume responsibility for the damage you’ve done\nin their life, without trying to make it all better immediately,” de Botton said.\n“They may see you as the devil for a while. Just live with that. I see a lot of people\nwanting always to be the nice person, even while doing something that’s going\nto be really di\u0000cult for the person.”\n\f\nDon’t be “nice” just to make yourself feel better. Give them space to move\non.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. When you’ve decided you want to break up with someone, it’s\ntime to make a plan. Think through what you’re going to say\nand when and where you’re going to say it. Be kind but ﬁrm.\n2. Use an accountability system and incentives to ensure that\nyou follow through with your plan.\n3. Make a post-breakup plan with your partner to take their\nneeds into consideration. And don’t have breakup sex!\n4. Make a post-breakup plan for yourself, including whom you’ll\nreach out to when you’re tempted to text your ex.\n5. After the breakup, give the other person space. Don’t try to be\nthe Nice Breakup Person. It makes you feel better but makes\nit harder for them to move on."

You have a patient with lung cancer, and you\nhave to decide how to treat them. Surgery or radiation? Surgery gives your\npatient a better chance at living long term, but is also riskier in the short term—\nthey could die while under the knife.\nYou consult your research and see short-term survival rates: 90 percent for\nsurgery and 100 percent for radiation. What would you pick? What about if,\ninstead, you read about short-term mortality rates—10 percent for surgery and 0\npercent for radiation?\nIn a now-famous study, health care researcher Barbara McNeil asked\nphysicians to make that exact hypothetical choice. And she asked one group of\ndoctors to choose based on survival rates and the other group on death rates.\nPerhaps alarmingly, the exact same information, presented in two di\u0000erent\nways, resulted in vastly di\u0000erent decisions. When she described the surgical\noption in terms of the chance of survival, 84 percent of physicians chose this\noption. When she discussed surgery in terms of the chance of dying, only half of\nthem opted for this treatment.\nWhy did this happen? The doctors responded to how the outlooks were\nframed. The framing e\u0000ect is our tendency to evaluate things di\u0000erently based\non how they’re presented—whether that’s a surgeon assessing risk, or a\nheartbroken person deciding how to move on after the end of a relationship."

For example, you can focus on\nall of the activities that you used to love but paused because your partner wasn’t\na fan. More on that later in the chapter. The point is that, rather than viewing\nthe experience as a devastating loss, you can see it as a gain, something\nempowering that will improve your life in the long run.\nSo turn o\u0000 that Bridget Jones TV marathon, put on some rose-colored glasses,\nand let’s turn this pity party into a joy fest. In this chapter, I’ll give you four\ndi\u0000erent reframes for your breakup and help you see that overcoming heartbreak\nis all about perspective.\nWHAT’S HAPPENING IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY\nBefore we jump into those reframes, I want to share what’s happening in your\nbrain and your body when you experience a breakup. Relationship scientists like\nClaudia Brumbaugh and R. Chris Fraley identify a breakup (or what they call a\n“relationship dissolution”) as “often one of the most distressing events that an\nindividual can experience in life.”\nAs I’ve mentioned, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher studies the brain\nin love. One of her favorite research techniques is using fMRI (functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging) brain scans to peek into our heads. She pops\npeople into the brain scanner at di\u0000erent stages in relationships: couples newly\nin love, people who claim to still be deeply in love after decades, and those who\nare going through a breakup.\nFisher and her team found that a region of the brain called the nucleus\naccumbens lights up when we see a picture of a person we’re in love with. It’s the\nsame part of the brain that’s activated when a drug addict thinks about getting a\nhit. It’s also the region of the brain a\u0000ected during a breakup. Our brain\nundergoes the same experience during a breakup and a drug withdrawal. It’s no\nwonder we want to keep getting high on our ex’s supply. Might as well face it:\nYou’re addicted to love.\nBreakups wreak havoc on our body, our feelings, and our behavior. Add to\nthat a dash of loneliness and a teaspoon of distress, and you’ve got the deadly"

    "raw_text": "breakup cocktail. According to Fisher, breakups have been found to increase our\ncortisol (stress hormone) levels, which then suppress our immune system and\nweaken our coping mechanisms. People may experience insomnia, intrusive\nthoughts, depression, anger, and debilitating anxiety. What’s surprising is that\nthey also score lower on IQ tests and perform worse on complex tasks that\nrequire reasoning or logic skills. Heck, people going through breakups have been\nfound to use drugs and commit crimes at higher rates. This holds true even if the\nperson in question was the one who asked for the breakup (whom researchers\nrefer to as “the initiator”).\nI’ve guided many clients through breakups. One of the reasons breakups are\nso painful is because our brain is hypersensitive to loss. And breakups are a\ndramatic loss. They are the death of your imagined future with your partner.\nYou’re grieving the loss of what was, what no longer is, and what will never be.\nNo wonder, thanks to loss aversion, we do so much to steer clear of them.\nHere’s the good news: Psychologists Eli Finkel and Paul Eastwick found that\n“a breakup is not nearly as bad as people imagine,” and that no matter how\nhappy a couple was in their relationship, when they break up, the pain is rarely as\nintense as they expected it would be.\nAccording to Gary Lewandowski, a professor and former chair in the\ndepartment of psychology at Monmouth University, we’re more resilient than\nwe think. He studied a group that you might anticipate would be the saddest in\nthe wake of a breakup: people who had been in a long-term relationship for at\nleast a few years, had been broken up within the last few months, and hadn’t\nfound a new partner. Instinctually, we’d expect the majority of them to view the\nbreakup as a terrible experience. Yet, when Lewandowski and his colleagues\ntalked to this group, they learned that only a third of them saw the breakup as\nnegative. Around 25 percent saw it as neutral, and 41 percent saw it as positive.\nSo allow me this cliché: This too shall pass. What you’re feeling now is\ntemporary. Your weird bodily reactions (goodbye, immune system and sleep!)\nwill end, the pain will fade, and you will overcome this terrible stage.\nReframe #1: Focus on the positives of the breakup.\n\f\nWhile you can’t wish away your pain, you can write your way to a less painful\nstory. Remember, your brain is your friend, and it’s really quite good at helping\nyou rationalize and get over things. It’s time to feed the beast! You can speed up\nthe healing process by giving your brain what it’s craving: reasons why the\nbreakup was actually for the best.\nLewandowski conducted an experiment in which he asked participants to\nwrite about either the positive aspects of the breakup (why it’s good you broke\nup), the negative aspects of the breakup (why it’s bad you broke up), or\nsomething super\u0000cial and unrelated to breakups. They completed this writing\nassignment for \u0000fteen to thirty minutes a day for three consecutive days. The\npeople who wrote about the positive aspects of the breakup reported feeling\nhappier, wiser, more grateful, con\u0000dent, comfortable, empowered, energized,\noptimistic, relieved, and satis\u0000ed than when the study began.\nWhen my clients go through breakups, I ask them to complete this same\nassignment. Here’s one list that Jing, my client who started dating for the \u0000rst\ntime at age thirty-one, emailed me after her breakup:\nThe pros of my breakup:\n1. Don’t have to worry about relocating to be near my ex’s family in Montana\n2. No more \u0000ghting about stealing the covers\n3. More time with my friends who my ex never prioritized\n4. Shorter commute since I won’t be staying at my ex’s apartment anymore\n5. No more going to work with dog hair on my clothes\n6. Don’t have to go to that expensive wedding over Labor Day weekend\n7. More time to spend working on music\n8. Don’t have to justify spending time with my brother, who my ex hated\n9. Don’t have to pretend to care about The Bachelor\n10. Chance to \u0000nd a happy/healthy relationship\n\f\nEXERCISE: Write About the Positives of the Breakup\nChannel your angst into a manifesto. It will be just like those\nemo songs you wrote as a teenager, except you won’t force\neighty people to listen to them at the local Battle of the Bands.\nGo to a café or sit on a park bench. Take a blank notebook (but\ndon’t watch The Notebook). Set a timer on your phone for\nthirty minutes. Without stopping, and without looking at your\nphone, write about all the positive aspects of the breakup. If\nyou’re feeling a bit of writer’s block and are having trouble\ngetting started, try making a list.\nTen Positive Aspects of My Breakup:\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10.\n\f\nReframe #2: Focus on the negatives of the relationship.\nOkay, okay. So maybe you’re not ready to “think positively” just yet. There’s\nanother way forward. In a study similar to the one I described above, clinical\npsychologists Sandra Langeslag and Michelle Sanchez asked participants\nexperiencing a breakup to do one of three things: Think negatively about the\nrelationship that ended; read statements about how it’s normal to experience\nstrong feelings after a breakup; or do something entirely di\u0000erent—like eating.\nThey found that those who were asked to think about the negative elements of\nthe relationship ultimately felt less infatuated with their ex than people in the\nother two groups.\nEXERCISE: Write About the Negatives of the Relationship\nFocus on the dark to ﬁnd the light. Journal about the negative\naspects of the relationship. That time she embarrassed you in\nfront of your friends because you thought “soup du jour” was a\nspeciﬁc type of soup. Or the moment he let you down and left\nyou stranded without a ride to the airport. From that sinking\nfeeling you had at the dinner table when you’d tried repeatedly\nto get him to ask about your call with your sister but he never\ntook the bait, to the time she got way too drunk, vomited, and\nsaid her ex was more fun than you. Wow, I’m getting\nexhausted just remembering all of these, and they’re your\nexperiences.\nSpend three consecutive nights writing for thirty minutes\nabout the negative elements of this relationship. What your\npartner did that annoyed you, the ways in which you were\ndysfunctional as a couple, or what side of yourself you had to\ngive up for the relationship.\nReframe #3: Rediscover Yourself."

    "raw_text": "Additional breakup research from Finkel and his colleagues found that breakups\ncan cause a bit of an identity crisis, because so much of who we are is tied up in\nthat relationship. Perhaps you’re dwelling on who you were—one half of a\ndynamic duo, the perfect wedding date. That perspective, while completely\nunderstandable, is loss-oriented. Instead, let’s focus on what you can gain from\nthe breakup—who you can be again now that you’re single.\nRelationship researchers have found this reframe particularly e\u0000ective. In one\nexperiment, Lewandowski divided people going through breakups into two\ngroups. He instructed one group to go out into the world and spend two weeks\ndoing routine activities—things the participants already liked doing, such as\ngoing to the movies or the gym or seeing friends. The other group was told to do\n“rediscover yourself” activities—things they had given up on because their ex\nwasn’t into them—like going to spin classes or jazz bars.\nLewandowski found that both interventions worked. Routine activities\nhelped prevent people from staying home and binge-swiping through pictures\nof their ex or drowning themselves in barrels of macaroni and cheese (my\nmedication of choice). But those who participated in rediscovery activities saw\neven better results. Those participants regained a part of their identity that had\nbeen lost in the relationship. Lewandoskwi explained that “for those people, it\nwas like the dawn of a new day.” They felt happier, less lonely, and more self-\naccepting.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Rediscover Yourself\nThink back: What are the activities you gave up because your\nex wasn’t interested in them? Did she hate the beach and\nfrown whenever you mentioned live music? (Who is this\nmonster?) Well, now you can go do those things on your own\nas rediscovery activities.\nGet out there! Dig out those boxing gloves, buy some new\nwatercolors, call up that old college friend your ex thought\nwas annoying. Go explore who you were and who you might\nbecome again. If you’re okay with a little spirituality talk, I\nrecommend the book The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron, even\nif you don’t think of yourself as an artist. It’s full of inspiration\nand ideas for you to reconnect with yourself (and your inner\ncreative spirit).\nList three rediscover yourself activities you’ll explore this\nmonth:\n1. \n2. \n3.\n\f\nKEEP FISHING\nSometimes people wink at me and say, “So, is it true? The best\nway to get over someone is by getting under someone else?” First,\ndon’t wink at me. Second, it depends.\nNot everyone who leaves a relationship needs months to heal.\nEspecially if you were the one who initiated the breakup.\nSociologist and Columbia University professor Diane Vaughan\nconducted extensive research on breakups in her book Uncoupling\nand found that we grieve a relationship over a certain timeline.\nPeople who initiate a breakup may have experienced negative\nfeelings about the relationship while still in it, perhaps for a year\nor more. So, when the breakup actually happens, they don’t need\nas much time. If you don’t feel as upset as you expected after a\nrelationship ends, don’t be alarmed. You’re not a heartless demon.\nYou did the grieving while still dating, and now you’re ready to\nmove on.\nIf you were broken up with, your timeline likely started after\nthe relationship ended, so it makes sense that you’ll take longer to\nheal.\nWhat about rebounds? Psychologists Claudia Brumbaugh and\nR. Chris Fraley found that “people who rapidly begin a new\nrebound relationship are not necessarily any worse oﬀ than those\nwho wait longer to get reinvolved. In fact, in some areas, they\nappear to be better functioning.” The authors explain that people\nwho wait longer to get into a relationship often suﬀer from\ndecreased self-esteem, while people who enter a new relationship\nquickly tend to be spared that self-conﬁdence hit. Moving from\none relationship to the next means they spend less time alone,\nquestioning their value.\nHow do you know when you’re ready to start dating? The only\nway to know whether you’re ready to start dating is to go on an\nactual date. If you come home from that date and cry, you\nprobably need a bit longer. But if you ﬁnd yourself having fun,\n\f\neven just a little, take that as a sign that you can keep going, one\nstep at a time.\nReframe #4: See this as a chance to learn from the past and make\nbetter decisions in the future.\nAs challenging as it sounds, try to see the breakup as a learning opportunity.\nPsychologists Ty Tashiro and Patricia Frazier found that people often don’t take\nadvantage of the potential for personal growth following a breakup. Many\nindividuals “Tarzan” (swing from one relationship to the next) without\nconsidering what they’ve learned from their last partner and how that should\ninform whom they choose to date next. Don’t make that mistake.\nThis is particularly important if you’re trapped in a pattern of choosing\npartners who don’t work out for the same reason. I’ve had several clients who\ndate the same type of person over and over.\nFor example, I worked with one client who always pursued younger guys.\nNice, fun, attractive men who ultimately refused to commit. She was searching\nfor a Prom Date, not a Life Partner. Her last breakup happened to occur during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This gave her the time she needed to pause and re\u0000ect\non her habits. Through our weekly remote sessions, she learned to recognize her\npattern. She came to the conclusion that her actions were preventing her from\n\u0000nding love. Though she’d met plenty of potentially great partners over the\nyears, she’d self-sabotaged, going after the emotionally unavailable younger guys\nto prevent herself from getting into a real relationship and possibly getting hurt.\nShe committed to making changes to break that habit. She started dating with\ndi\u0000erent priorities and opened her eyes to Prom Date red \u0000ags. She gave guys her\nown age and older a chance. She video-chatted with a number of eligible suitors.\nThen she went for a walking date with the guy she liked most. After some more\nsocially distanced hangs, they decided to give quarantining together a chance.\nMoving in with someone she barely knew was completely outside her comfort\nzone. But the world felt so upside down that she decided to try something new.\nThey’re still happily cohabitating and are planning a road trip to visit each\nother’s families."

    "raw_text": "EXERCISE: Consider What You Want to Do Diﬀerently in\nFuture Relationships\nA key part of moving on is getting clear about the choices you\nmade in your last relationship and changes you’ll make in your\nnext one. In a journal or with a friend, take some time to\nanswer the following questions:\n1. Who were you in your last relationship? (For example, the\npace-setter, pulling your partner along with you? Or the\ncaboose, being pulled? The mentor or the mentee? The one\nwho committed easily or the person who struggled to put\ndown roots?)\n2. Whom do you want to be in your next one?\n3. What have you learned about what truly matters in a long-\nterm relationship?\n4. Moving forward, what will you look for in a partner that\nyou didn’t prioritize this time?\nThe key to this reframe is recognizing that there’s gain even in loss.\nPsychologists refer to “meaning-making,” the process through which people\ncome to understand a life event, a relationship, or themselves. In his landmark\nbook Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist and\npsychiatrist who survived the Holocaust, explained that meaning-making allows\nus to move from su\u0000ering to growth: “In some way, su\u0000ering ceases to be\nsu\u0000ering at the moment it \u0000nds a meaning.”\nTry to not see the breakup as a failure but, rather, as a chance to make better\ndecisions in the future. Update your thinking from “Time heals all wounds” to\n“Meaning heals all wounds.”\n\f\nEXERCISE: Explore the Deeper Meaning\nTake some time to answer the following questions:\n1. What did you learn from this relationship?\n2. What did you learn from the breakup?\n3. How are you diﬀerent from the person you were before this\nrelationship?\n4. What changes will you make in your life as a result of this\nexperience?\nInstead of breaking down, break open. Perhaps you’ll even wind up a\nstronger, more beautiful person. In his TEDx Talk, Gary Lewandowski\nexplained the concept of Kintsugi. It refers to a Japanese art form in which\nbroken pottery is put back together using precious metals like gold and silver;\nthe repaired pottery is often more beautiful than it was before it was damaged.\nLewandowski encourages us to see heartbreak as art break: “It’s also a\nphilosophy which treats damage and its repair as an opportunity—something to\ntake advantage of, not to conceal, right? This is exactly what can happen in your\nrelationship. Sure, your relationship might leave you with a few cracks, but those\ncracks, those imperfections, those are sources of strength and beauty, because\nbreakups don’t have to leave you broken, because you’re stronger than you\nknow.”\nYou may not have gotten to choose what happened to your relationship, but\nyou do get to choose (in part) how it makes you feel—and what you do next.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. We’re affected by framing—our tendency to evaluate things\ndifferently based on how they’re presented. You can speed\nup your recovery process after a breakup by reframing this\nexperience from a loss to an opportunity for growth and\nlearning.\n2. Breakups wreak havoc on your physical and emotional\nhealth. But we’re more resilient than we think. What you feel\nduring a breakup is only temporary.\n3. Journaling helps. Write about the positive aspects of the\nbreakup, and the negative aspects of the relationship, to help\nyourself move forward.\n4. You can regain your sense of identity, which is often\ndisrupted by a breakup, by participating in “rediscover\nyourself” activities—things that you enjoyed doing previously\nbut gave up during your relationship.\n5. You can grow from the experience by focusing on what you\nlearned and what you’ll do differently in the future. Go from\n“Time heals all wounds” to “Meaning heals all wounds.”"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 17\nBEFORE YOU TIE THE KNOT, DO\nTHIS\nHow to Decide if You Should Get Married\n“Please complete these three worksheets before Wednesday,” I said.\nAnd no, I wasn’t talking to a client.\nI handed Scott several pieces of paper full of probing questions about his life,\nhis family, and our relationship. He groaned. I didn’t blame him.\nWelcome to life as my boyfriend. We’d been dating for four years, so he was\nused to serving as my guinea pig, piloting my relationship activities before I\nmade recommendations to my clients.\nThis particular homework assignment was designed to help us discuss getting\nmarried, something we’d been considering for a while. We’d gone through major\nrelationship decision points: Are we dating? Should we move in together? Should\nwe break up? But now we faced a new set of intimidating questions: Do we want\nto spend our lives together? What would that life look like? I was in love with him,\nbut I also knew enough about relationship science to understand the challenges\nwe faced. So many marriages don’t last.\nThis felt like the biggest decision of our lives so far. And it turned out we\nwere right to make the choice carefully. Marriage matters, in more ways than you\nmay realize. In their book The Case for Marriage, journalist Maggie Gallagher\nand sociologist Linda J. Waite found that the happiness and satisfaction of\nmarriage has a tremendous impact on happiness, physical and mental health, life\nexpectancy, wealth, and the well-being of children.\n\f\nI thought Scott and I needed a pre-marriage boot camp, so I created one. It’s\ncalled “It’s About Time: Past, Present, and Future.” (Note: The runner-up\ntitle was “It’s About Time: F**king Put a Ring on It.”) It’s designed to help you\nthink about where you’ve been, where you are, and where you’re going. Luckily,\nScott was game to participate. This process helped us, so I’ve since shared it with\nmy clients and friends. And now I’m sharing it with you.\nYou may be thinking, I don’t care about marriage. It’s a dumb institution. I\ndon’t need the government and the church telling me how to live. That’s \u0000ne. But I\nassume that if you’re reading this book, you’re hoping to \u0000nd a long-term\npartner. In this chapter, I refer to “marriage,” but if you don’t plan to get\nmarried and would rather substitute the phrase “long-term committed\nrelationship” (or replace the tradition of rings with mutual tattoos of the other\nperson’s face on your face), that’s also a great way to read this chapter.\nWE’RE IN LOVE: ISN’T THAT ENOUGH?\nRemember, love is a drug. Here’s how writer George Bernard Shaw put it in his\nplay Getting Married: “When two people are under the in\u0000uence of the most\nviolent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are\nrequired to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting\ncondition continuously until death do them part.” During the \u0000rst few years of a\nrelationship, when our brain experiences the e\u0000ects of this drug, it’s almost\nimpossible to rationally evaluate that partnership.\nCouples who date longer before getting married have better odds of staying\ntogether, in part because that honeymoon-period high is already wearing o\u0000\nwhen they tie the knot. Their eyes are more open when they say “I do.” Couples\nwho wait one to two years before getting engaged are 20 percent less likely to get\ndivorced than those who wait under a year before putting a ring on it. Couples\nwho wait at least three years before engagement are 39 percent less likely to get\ndivorced than those who get engaged before a year.\nIt’s not just about waiting until you’ve been with the person for a longer\nperiod of time. It also might pay to get married when you’re a bit older.\nResearchers like sociologist Philip Cohen attribute the declining divorce rate\n\f\nsince the 1980s partially to couples getting married later. Perhaps you should\nfollow my quirky aunt Nancy’s rule with her kids: “No marriage until thirty!”\nEven if you wait a few years, love can still obscure your priorities. When I\ninterviewed a series of divorce lawyers (a bit of an awkward hobby to explain to\nScott), several said that couples often make the same big mistake when\nconsidering marriage. They’re so fond of each other that they assume the other\nperson wants the same things in life; therefore, they don’t set aside the time to\ntalk explicitly about major decisions like where to live or if they want children.\nIn fact, journalist Naomi Schaefer Riley, author of ’Til Faith Do Us Part:\nHow Interfaith Marriage Is Transforming America, found: “Remarkably, less\nthan half of the interfaith couples in my survey said they’d discussed, before\nmarrying, what faith they planned to raise their kids in.” By the time couples\ndiscover their incompatibility on fundamental values, they’re already married.\nEnter the divorce lawyer.\nThis optimistic assumption that you and your partner want the same thing\nmakes sense, by the way. We’re led astray by the false-consensus e\u0000ect—a\ntendency to assume that the majority of others agree with our own values,\nbeliefs, and behaviors. For example, imagine someone who cares about the\nenvironment and tries to limit her own meat eating, fossil-fuel usage, and plastic\nconsumption. If a local referendum asked voters to rule on a plastic-bag ban,\nthat person might expect the rule to pass easily, because she would assume that\nothers see the world through the same green-tinted glasses. In a relationship, we\ntake it for granted that our partner sees the world the same way we do—and\ntherefore wants the same things, whether it’s how many kids to have or where to\nlive or how to spend or save money. The drug of infatuation, combined with the\nfalse-consensus e\u0000ect, leads a lot of couples to skip crucial pre-marital\nconversations. So, no, being in love is not enough. It’s time to think critically\nabout whether you should get married.\nPART 1: ALL ABOUT ME\n\f\nEXERCISE: Answer the All About Me Questions\nBefore you think about yourself as part of a couple, consider\nyour individual wants and needs. Schedule some time alone. I\nrecommend blocking oﬀ a weekend morning, going solo to a\ncoﬀee shop with a notebook, and answering these questions.\n1. Is my partner more of a Prom Date or a Life Partner? In\nother words, is this someone who will be by my side for the\nlong term, or someone who’s just fun now?\n2. The Wardrobe Test: If my partner were a piece of clothing\nin my closet, what would they be?\n3. Is this someone I can grow with?\n4. Do I admire this person?\n5. What side of me does this person bring out?\n6. Is this the person I want to share my good news with?\n7. When I have a hard day at work, do I want to talk about it\nwith my partner?\n8. Do I value my partner’s advice?\n9. Am I looking forward to building a future with this person?\nCan I envision reaching key life milestones together, such\nas buying a house or having a family?\n10. Is this someone I can make tough decisions with? If I\nimagine worst-case scenarios, like losing a job or losing a\nchild, is this the person I’d want by my side to think\nthrough questions like “Should we relocate?” or “How can\nwe manage our grief while taking care of our other\nchildren?”\n11. Do we communicate well and ﬁght productively?\nRead through your responses. But instead of reviewing them as yourself,\npretend you’re reading what your best friend wrote about her relationship. The"

Giving yourself some\ndistance—by imagining you’re helping a friend—should provide some\nperspective.\nIf this were your close friend, for whom you care deeply and want only the\nbest, how would you advise this person? Are you in favor of the marriage? Do\nyou harbor some concerns? What unanswered questions should they address\nbefore moving forward?\nSit with the feelings that come up as you review your answers. This is your\nmoment to decide whether you hit the gas or the brakes. Move to Part 2 only if\nyou decide this is the right relationship for you right now. If you’re unsure, you\nmay want to revisit Chapter 14, to see if it’s time to end it or mend it. And if you\ndon’t feel ready to get married, that does not spell disaster. You may simply need\nto spend more time investing in the relationship before you’re ready for the next\nstage. There’s no point in rushing such a momentous decision. Remember,\ncouples who wait at least three years are 39 percent less likely to get divorced\nthan those who get engaged after less than a year.\nPart 2: All About Us\nIf Part 1 goes well, and you decide to continue, it’s time to talk to your partner.\nThese are heavy conversations. Set aside three nights over a month. Don’t cram\nthem all into one evening!\nYour goal, throughout these conversations, is to stay curious.

I recommend doing\nan activity together ﬁrst to help you feel connected.\nPsychotherapist Esther Perel notes that one of the\nmoments when we feel most attracted to our partners is\nwhen we admire their individual talents. Invest in that\nattraction by teaching each other a new skill. If one of you is\na great cook, why not teach the other a new recipe?\nYou also want to make the experience feel romantic. I\nmean, you’re talking about possibly getting married—what\ncould be more romantic than that? Set the scene. Dress up.\n(Read: Don’t wear those hideous red sweatpants you got at\nsomeone’s bat mitzvah ten years ago and refuse to throw\naway even though your ﬁancé hates them.) Pull out the\nbottle of wine you’ve been saving, cue the Sam Cooke\nplaylist, and snuggle up to answer these questions.\nConversation #1: The Past\nWhat are three moments about your past that you feel\ndeﬁne you?\nHow do you think your childhood aﬀects who you are\ntoday?\nDid your parents ﬁght? What are your fears around\nrelationship conﬂict?\nWhat traditions from your family do you want to carry\non in our family?\nHow did your family talk (or not talk) about sex when\nyou were growing up?\n\f\nWhat did money represent in your family?\nWhat baggage from your family do you want to leave\nin the past?\nConversation #2: The Present\nDo you feel comfortable talking to me as things come\nup?\nIs there anything about our communication style that\nyou want to work on?\nDo you feel like you can be yourself in the relationship?\nWhy or why not?\nWhat changes would you like to make to our\nrelationship?\nHow well do you think we handle conﬂict?\nWhat’s your favorite ritual that we do together?\nWhat’s something you wish we did more of together?\nHow well do you feel like I know your friends and\nfamily? Is there anyone in your life (family, friend,\ncoworker) whom you’d like me to get to know better?\nHow often would you like to be having sex? How could\nour sex life be better? What can I do to improve it?\nWhat’s something you’ve always wanted to try but have\nbeen afraid to ask for?\nHow often do you think about money?\nLet’s talk openly about our ﬁnances.

Surrogacy?\nWhat are your expectations around splitting child care\nand housework duties?\nHow often do you want to see your family?\nWhat role do you want religion or spirituality play in\nour lives?\nDo you want to discuss a prenup?

How can I help\nyou achieve it?\n\f\nYou may worry that these conversations will be awkward or forced. Scott and\nI expected that, too. But as we made our way through them, we shared long-\nforgotten stories from our childhoods. Like the time I had a middle-school\nmeltdown because I was jealous that my neighbor received ten shimmery MAC\neye shadows—the sixth-grade equivalent of a Rolex—from her parents for\nValentine’s Day. (What kind of parents even give their kids presents on\nValentine’s Day?) Scott told me a hilarious story about how his mom refused to\nbuy him a pricey pair of JNCO jeans—the pinnacle of fashion for middle-\nschoolers in the late ’90s. (After looking at pictures of these hideous jeans on the\nInternet, I think his mother made the right call.)\nDuring one of these conversations, we discovered that Scott wants only one\nchild, and I would like two. He’s an only child and I have a sister, and\napparently, we both want to re-create the dynamic we had growing up. Our date\nsuddenly turned combative as we argued the merits of our respective childhoods.\nScott expressed his belief that it’s morally questionable to add more than one\nchild to an overpopulated planet, while I argued that having a sibling\nautomatically enrolls you in ten thousand hours of training in emotional\nintelligence. Even though we didn’t see eye to eye on this point, I was happy we\nidenti\u0000ed our di\u0000ering views. We decided it wasn’t a dealbreaker, because while\nour preferences weren’t aligned, we were both willing to compromise. We plan\nto have one kid and see how we feel after that.\nThese conversations convinced me that not only was this the right\nrelationship for right now, it was also the right partnership moving forward. I\nadmire Scott’s discipline—the way he works out every day, cooks healthy vegan\nmeals, stays up late \u0000nding bugs in his software. I love our silly voices and inside\njokes. And I believe in us as a team. We know how to compromise and take turns\ngetting our way. When I asked myself the Wardrobe Test question, I imagined\nhim as my favorite pair of red-checkered onesie pajamas, which make me feel\nsafe, warm, and supported. Like I’m wearing a hug.\nAbout six months after we completed this process, Scott invited me to our\nfriend David’s magic show. David is a talented mentalist magician who can\n\f\ndivine the names of childhood pets and obscure vacation destinations of total\nstrangers. He has a regular Wednesday-night show at a theater nestled in the back\nof a bar called PianoFight.\nThat night, as David \u0000nished, the crowd rose in a standing ovation. After the\napplause, David said, “I have one more trick.” At the beginning of the show,\naudience members had written their name and a single word on blank playing\ncards. David asked a volunteer to select a card. I heard him call my name, and I\nmade my way to the stage.\nThen David told me to pull another card at random. Magically, the one I\nchose had Scott’s name on it. Scott walked down the stairs to sit next to me\nonstage.\nWe sat there, the lights blinding us to the \u0000fty-person audience. David took a\nvolunteer’s phone, opened the calculator app, and started multiplying numbers\nsupplied by members of the crowd. The \u0000nal tally emerged: 452015. David\nasked if this number meant anything to us. I didn’t recognize it.\nThen he drew two slashes between the digits, transforming the number into\n4/5/2015. He asked, “Is this your birthday? Scott’s?” No—it was our\nanniversary.\nThen David took the deck of cards with names and words on it and asked me\nto split it into \u0000ve piles. He asked Scott to turn over the top cards one at a time,\nand instructed me to transcribe the message on a large easel.\n“Will…,” I wrote on the board as Scott read the \u0000rst card.\n“You… be… my…”\nI covered my face with my hands as I waited for the \u0000nal card.\n“Wife.”\nScott stood up from his chair and pulled a ring from his pocket. He got down\non one knee. I nodded, grabbed the ring, and pulled him into a hug. After the\ncrowd erupted, David whisked us out of the theater. We emerged into the bar,\nwhere a group of thirty friends greeted us. They had formed a “love tunnel,”\nstanding two by two with their arms extended overhead. We ran triumphantly\nthrough the tunnel.\nAlthough the proposal was a huge surprise, the fact that we wanted to marry\neach other wasn’t. We’d done the work. We’d had the hard conversations. We’d\n\f\nchosen to decide, not slide.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Love is a drug that intoxicates us.\n2. The false-consensus effect is our tendency to think other\npeople see things the same way we do. When love and the\nfalse-consensus effect combine early in relationships,\ncouples often fail to discuss important aspects of their\nfuture before they decide to get married. They assume they\nboth want the same things without ever conﬁrming that,\nwhich can lead to unhappy endings.\n3. Before you decide to tie the knot, you can override the false-\nconsensus effect by completing a series of self-reﬂection\nand partner activities called “It’s About Time: Past, Present,\nand Future.” You should have conversations about the past\n(where you’ve been), the present (where you are now), and\nthe future (where you’re going). And it’s crucial to make time\nto discuss topics like money, sex, religion, and children."

    "raw_text": "CREATING A RELATIONSHIP THAT CHANGES WITH THE PEOPLE IN\nIT\nWhen people ask me what makes a relationship work long term, I often refer to\nthis quote about Charles Darwin’s \u0000ndings on natural selection: “It is not the\nstrongest of the species which survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one\nmost responsive to change.” Even if you have a strong relationship today, your\nrelationship may fail if you don’t adapt. Your life or your partner’s life might\ntake an unpredictable course. Creating a relationship that can evolve is the key to\nmaking it last.\nPerhaps you don’t think you’ll change much in the future. You’ve already\nbecome the person you’re going to be long term.\n\f\nEXERCISE: Answer These Two Questions\n1. How much do you think you’ve changed over the last ten\nyears?\n_________ _________ _________ _________\n1. How much do you think you’ll change in the next ten?\n_________ _________ _________ _________\nHarvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert and his team posed these same\nquestions to a large group of participants. They asked some people to predict\nhow much they’d change in the coming decade. Others answered questions on\nhow much they’d changed over the previous decade. Most people believed they’d\nchanged signi\u0000cantly in the previous decade, but they didn’t expect to change\nmuch in the next ten years. They’re wrong. Gilbert calls this the end-of-history\nillusion.\nGilbert pointed out that we fully expect to physically age—our hair will go\ngray and our body will change—but we each think that “by and large the core of\nme, my identity, my values, my personality, my deepest preferences, are not going\nto change from here on out.” The truth is, we never stop growing and changing.\nAnd just as we, as individuals, will continue to change over the course of our\nlives, so will our relationships. Sometimes one partner will struggle and the other\nwill keep the family a\u0000oat. Sometimes you’ll feel deeply in love and sometimes\nyou won’t be able to stand each other. Sometimes you’ll \u0000nd it easy to talk and\nsometimes it will feel like a wall has cropped up between you.\nBecause of the ever-changing nature of relationships, we should act as if they\nare living, breathing things. But too often we treat our relationship like a toaster.\nWe take it out of the box, plug it in, and hope it stays the same. A toaster works\nbest on the day you buy it, and it slowly gets worse over time. No one assumes\ntheir toaster will adapt or improve. In marriage, we commit to the institution on\nour wedding day and expect it to stay the same—till death do us part."

    "raw_text": "Well, how’s that toaster working out for us? If you look at divorce and\nseparation rates, 50 percent of people are returning their toasters. Our\nrelationships are failing in part because they’re not designed to be, in Darwinian\nterms, “responsive to change.”\nLet’s ditch the toaster and bring romance into the twenty-\u0000rst century by\nadopting the philosophy of Intentional Love. This book is about being\nintentional in how you enter a relationship. That way of thinking guides the\nnext part of your story, too.\nTo get there, I’ve designed a set of tools, informed by behavioral science, that\nwill help create the kind of lasting relationship we all say we want but very few of\nus know how to maintain. For the past few years, thousands of couples around\nthe world have accessed these tools in hopes of creating a relationship that is\nadaptable, durable, and most important, built to last.\nTHE RELATIONSHIP CONTRACT\nFor many of us, the only time we articulate the speci\u0000cs of the marital\ncommitment is during the wedding ceremony itself. But as we live longer, there\nmight be over half a century between when we say our vows and when that\nwhole “till death do us part” clause kicks in. We need a modernized system that\nhelps us adapt our partnerships as the people in them grow and change. Enter\nthe Relationship Contract.\nIn Chapter 15, I explained the power of creating a written plan for a breakup,\nand how actively signing up to participate in something makes you far more\nlikely to do it than if you passively agree to it. That’s the same logic behind this\nliving, breathing Relationship Contract, a document that’s designed to change\nand grow over time.\nThis works for couples who are either married or in a long-term committed\nrelationship. Let’s start with a disclaimer: The word “contract” might sound\nscary, but this is by no means a prenup. We’re talking about a non–legally\nbinding, mutually agreed-upon document that helps couples create a shared\nvision for their relationship. Scribble it down on a napkin, draft it in a Google\ndoc, or spell it out in fridge magnets."

    "raw_text": "These agreements catalyze conversations that couples should have\nperiodically to \u0000gure out what they want out of their relationship. They should\naddress questions like: How often do we want to see our extended families? How do\nwe split our bills? Is sex important to us? Are we monogamous? And how do we\ndeﬁne monogamy?\nPsychologists Jesse Owen, Galena Rhoades, and Scott Stanley observed that\ncouples who take the time to talk through big decisions are happier than those\nwho don’t. I’ve led workshops around the country to help hundreds of couples\ndo just that by creating a Relationship Contract.\nWhen you \u0000ll out this Relationship Contract, you should be honest,\nvulnerable, and willing to compromise. This is absolutely not a time to dwell on\nyour partner’s shortcomings; nor is it the moment to make demands. The focus\nshould not be transactional—“I’ll do the laundry if you’ll do the dishes”—but,\nrather, value-based—“We commit to supporting each other’s dreams and\nmaking the sacri\u0000ces necessary to enable those dreams.”\nWithout fail, I’m surprised by the diversity of clauses in these contracts. Some\nare serious, like those from the couple who outlined how they’d pay o\u0000 their\nstudent debts. And some are silly, like the ones composed by the pair who\npledged to stop buying IKEA furniture.\nOn the \u0000rst page of the contract, the couple sets a speci\u0000c date in the future\nwhen they’ll revisit the agreement. On that date, they give each other feedback\non how they’re doing. Some couples reevaluate their contract annually. Others\ndo it after \u0000ve or seven years. This conversation forces a decision point when the\ncouple can ask: What does our relationship need now? Then they’re able to\namend the contract to re\u0000ect how they’ve changed as individuals. It also allows\nfor consistent relationship tune-ups, well before there’s a breakdown. As John F.\nKennedy said, “The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.” He\nwasn’t talking about his marriage, but you get the idea.\nChoose to decide, not slide. In the Appendix, I’ve included a two-part\nexercise for writing your own Relationship Contract. These materials have been\ncreated in partnership with my friend and collaborator Hannah Hughes. First\nyou’ll see the Self-Re\u0000ection Worksheet, which you should \u0000ll out on your own.\nIt asks questions about how much alone time you need, what your love\n\f\nlanguages are, what rituals you value in the relationship, and more. Then you’ll\nsee a blank copy of the Relationship Contract, which you should collaborate on\nwith your partner afterward.\nEXERCISE: The Relationship Contract\nFind a weekend when you and your partner are both free. If\nyou can go on a weekend getaway, great! If not, plan a\nromantic staycation. First and foremost, turn oﬀ your phones.\nThroughout the weekend, in between delicious meals and\nconstant canoodling, ﬁnd time to work on your Relationship\nContract. Make this discussion about love and connection.\nThink: Love Actually, not love contractually.\nTHE CHECK-IN RITUAL\nI love this quotation from psychotherapist Esther Perel: “The quality of your\nrelationships determines the quality of your life. Relationships are your story,\nwrite well, and edit often.”\nHow often does she mean? I’m a fan of the weekly Check-In Ritual, a short\nconversation in which you and your partner discuss what’s on your mind. The\nRelationship Contract helps you set the direction for your partnership—and the\nCheck-In Ritual ensures that you keep it on track. Many couples are afraid to\nspeak honestly about what they want, whether it’s about having kids, opening\ntheir relationship, or even ending it. All relationships have issues, and almost all\nof us feel awkward about bringing them up. The Relationship Contract and the\nCheck-In Ritual are tools expressly designed to make it less awkward.\nEvery Sunday night, Scott and I sit down on our big white couch to talk. He\nalways sits near the door (which I choose not to read too much into), and I\nsprawl out on the ottoman. He’s usually eating popcorn, and I’m still feeling\nstu\u0000ed from dinner.\n\f\nWe ask each other these three questions: How was your last week? Did you feel\nsupported by me? How can I support you in the coming week? Sometimes this\nCheck-In \u0000ies by in under \u0000ve minutes. But when we’re having an o\u0000 week, the\nCheck-In turns into a long, intimate conversation. Sure, these discussions can be\ndi\u0000cult, but they’re frequently important and illuminating. We try to deal with\nproblems as they arise. It’s how we stay connected and discover new things\nabout ourselves and our relationship. Creating this ritual lets us address what’s\ngoing on before too much time passes and too much resentment has built up.\nJust as important as the Check-In conversation is the ritual itself. Making this\na consistent, recurring event takes advantage of a super-simple principle\nbehavioral scientists often employ: If we put something on our calendar, and\nmake it the default, we’re way more likely to actually do it. And because these\nCheck-Ins are recurring events on our calendar, neither of us has to nag the\nother into \u0000nding the time to talk about what matters. The calendar does the\nnudging for us. Many couples I’ve worked with who’ve adopted the Check-In\nRitual report feeling happier, more passionate, and more resilient.\nAsk yourself this question: What would my life look like if I sat down with\nmy partner on a regular basis and expressed what’s really going on for me? I\npromise you, it’s worth it. Choose Intentional Love."

You designed your life, you held yourself\naccountable, you were honest with yourself about who you were and what you\nwanted, and most important, you course-corrected when you had to. You didn’t\nlive someone else’s idea of life, you lived yours.\nIn researching this book, I had the honor of meeting many people who\ninspire me: people who embody the ideals of Intentional Love.\nFor instance, there’s the man who goes on dates and tells the truth about\nwhat he wants—nothing serious—and more often than not, his words are met\nwith appreciation and relief.\n\f\nThen there’s the trans woman who \u0000nally found a partner who can make her\norgasm in her new body. They just bought a house together, using their veteran\nbene\u0000ts.\nThere’s the man who learned to ask his wife for what he wanted from their\nhouse—a space he could decorate that feels like his own.\nThere’s the couple who embraces non-monogamy and bought a home for\ntheir secondary and tertiary partners to all raise a family together.\nSome of these couples shouldn’t work at all on paper, yet because they are\nintentional, their lives are \u0000lled with pleasure and joy. Some of these couples have\nlived through tragedies like rare cancers and multiple miscarriages. But they\nwork through it by putting tremendous energy into their relationship every day.\nThey are determined to beat the odds, to be part of that too-small percentage of\ncouples who are happy and thriving.\nYou have a chance. It’s not a secret how to do it. I hope this book has shown\nyou how. Now go out there and live intentionally ever after.\n\f\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n1. Over the last forty years, fewer and fewer of us are ﬁnding\nlong-term relationship happiness. The good news is that\ngreat relationships are created, not discovered. You can build\nthe relationship of your dreams.\n2. Creating a relationship that can evolve is the key to making it\nlast. We underestimate how much we’ll grow and change in\nthe future, and should seek out relationships where we can\nlearn and grow together with our partner.\n3. Writing a Relationship Contract allows you to set the\ndirection for your partnership and revise that vision over time.\nA weekly Check-In Ritual helps you deal with problems as\nthey arise.\n4. In a world of Intentional Love, you design your life, you hold\nyourself accountable, you are honest with yourself about who\nyou are and what you want, and most important, you course-\ncorrect when you need to. You don’t live someone else’s idea\nof life, you live yours. Now go out there and live intentionally\never after.\n\f\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWriting a book is something you do alone. Unless, like me, you’re lucky enough\nto have a community of trusted friends and advisers who take on your project as\ntheir own.\nScott Mayer Mckinney, you spent countless hours editing the manuscript,\nstewarding my mental health, and reminding me that I have much to learn in the\n\u0000eld of relationship science. You are my forever coauthor.\nMolly Glauberman, my beloved product manager, you created the structure\nand support I needed to give birth to this book. It’s only fair you’d get Ben in\nreturn. Ellen Huet, my grammarian and trusted advisor, your generous feedback\nat all hours strengthened my ideas, writing, and jokes. Making friends in\nadulthood is challenging. It took me eight years to \u0000nd you two, but I am\ngrateful every day that I never stopped looking.\nConnor Diemand-Yauman, I feel so lucky that you chose to pour yourself\ninto this project. Each chapter is funnier and deeper because of your input.\nLiz Fosslien, I admire your creativity, wit, and brilliance. Thank you for your\ncandid feedback throughout the book process. I am always myself with you and\nthat is a rare gift.\nKimberly Baudhuin, we make a great team. Thanks for saving the day, often.\nBritt Nelson and Hannah Hughes, thank you for lending me your excellent\ntaste. Your design skills o\u0000ered strength during a challenging time.\nRose Bern, thanks for your invaluable contributions to the proposal and the\nbook’s foundational research.\nToby Stein, my partner in mischief. You are the paragon of friendship, and\nyour hands-on support throughout the book process proved invaluable."

We\nunderstand that it’s easier to deepen and strengthen a relationship\nduring periods of love and happiness rather than trying to improve it\nduring a rough patch.\nThis commitment is drafted for the mutual beneﬁt of all parties in this\nrelationship.\nThis agreement is entered into by and between:\nPartner 1:_________ _________ _________ _________\nPartner 2:_________ _________ _________ _________\n(hereafter referred to as Partner 1 and Partner 2) The term of this\nagreement shall begin on_________ _________ .\nWe agree to revisit this agreement on_________ _________ _.\nBIDS FOR CONNECTION\nRelationship researchers John and Julie Gottman tell us that a “bid” is\nthe “fundamental unit of emotional communication.” Bids can be small\nor big, verbal or nonverbal. At their core, they’re simply requests to\nconnect. And they might take the form of an expression, question, or\nphysical outreach. Or they can be funny, serious, or even sexual in\nnature. Every time your partner makes a bid, you have a choice. You\ncan “turn toward” the bid, acknowledging your partner’s needs; or\n“turn away,” ignoring the request for connection. People in successful\nrelationships turn toward each other 86 percent of the time. Those in\nstruggling relationships turn toward each other only 33 percent of the\n\f\ntime. Couples that turn toward each other’s bids enjoy a relationship\nthat’s full of trust, passion, and satisfying sex.\nWe commit to bidding often and turning toward our partner’s bids as\noften as we can:\nPartner 1 Partner 2\nInitial here:_________ __ Initial here:_________ __\nTIME\nRITUALS\nEach week, we want to spend the following one-on-one time together:\n(Mark the number of times per week you’ll see each other during this\ntime slot)\nWeekday mornings_________ ________\nWeekday afternoons_________ ________\nWeekday evenings_________ ________\nWeekend mornings_________ ________\nWeekend afternoons_________ ________\nWeekend evenings_________ ________\nWe’ll spend one-on-one time together_______ occasion(s) per week.\nWe’ll spend_______ days/nights together without using our phones\neach week.\nSome of our favorite shared rituals are:\n(For example, grocery shopping, movie dates, breakfast in bed, etc.) \nWe commit to doing these as often as we can.\n\f\nIf we miss_________  number of opportunities for quality time per\nmonth, we will make it up by: (For example, going away for a weekend,\ncooking dinner at home together, etc.) \nWe also want to try new rituals.\nBetween now and our next check-in, we will adopt the new ritual of:\n(For example, cooking Sunday brunch, saying what we’re grateful for\nbefore bed, etc.) \nSPECIAL ACTIVITIES\nThree special activities that really matter to us are: (For example,\ntraveling, fancy restaurants, taking a class together, etc.)\n1. \n2. \n3. \nWe commit to making time for these activities with the following\nfrequency: (For example, cooking together—once a week, etc.)\n1. \n2. \n3.\n\f\nSOLO TIME\nWe recognize people need diﬀerent amounts of alone time to recharge.\nPartner 1\nI require the following amount of alone time:\nA lot (multiple hours per day)\nSome (at least one night a week)\nNot much (I get it when I can)\nA treasured solo activity for me is:\nPartner 2\nI require the following amount of alone time:\nA lot (multiple hours per day)\nSome (at least one night a week)\nNot much (I get it when I can)\nA treasured solo activity for me is:\nWe both acknowledge the other’s needs in terms of time apart.\nFRIENDS\nWe prefer our friend group to be:\nCompletely shared\nSomewhat overlapping\nCompletely separate\nPartner 1\nI commit to getting to know the following three people in Partner 2’s\nsocial circle:\n\f\n1. \n2. \n3. \nPartner 2\nI commit to getting to know the following three people in Partner 1’s\nsocial circle:\n1. \n2. \n3. \nOne goal for our social lives between now and our next check-in is: (for\nexample, attend more parties together, join a sports team, host\nmonthly dinners) \nFAMILY\nWe’ll see Partner 1’s family with the following frequency:\nWeekly\nMonthly\nYearly\nOther:_________ ________\nWe’ll see Partner 2’s family with the following frequency:\nWeekly\nMonthly\nYearly\n\f\nOther:_________ ________\nHOLIDAYS AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS\nThe following holidays/special occasions are prioritized as follows: (for\nexample, at a certain family’s house, through a certain faith, etc).\nOccasion 1:_________ ________\nHow we’d like to spend it:_________ ________\nOccasion 2:_________ ________\nHow we’d like to spend it:_________ ________\nOccasion 3:_________ ________\nHow we’d like to spend it:_________ ________\nEMOTIONAL NEEDS\nLOVE LANGUAGES\nWe understand that people prefer to receive love in diﬀerent ways.

For this reason, these behaviors are\ncollectively known as “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.”\nAvoiding the Four Horsemen\nCriticism: Instead of verbally attacking my partner’s character or\npersonality, I will talk about how I’m feeling and make a speciﬁc\nrequest for diﬀerent behavior in the future (for example, “I feel lonely\nwhen you don’t spend time with me. I want us to spend one night a\nweek together” rather than “You don’t care about me!”).\nContempt: Instead of attacking my partner, I’ll build a culture of\nappreciation and remind myself of my partner’s strengths."
