Why a full-scale discussion of \nThe Magic of Thinking Big\n? Thousands of books\nwill be published this year. Why one more?\nPermit me to give you just a little background.\nSeveral years ago I witnessed an exceptionally impressive sales meeting. The vice president in\ncharge of marketing for this company was tremendously excited. He wanted to drive home a point. He\nhad with him on the platform the leading representative in the organization, a very ordinary-looking\nfellow, who earned in the year just ended just a little under $60,000. The earnings of other\nrepresentatives averaged $12,000.\nThe executive challenged the group. Here is what he said: “I want you to take a good look at\nHarry. Look at him! Now, what’s Harry got that the rest of you haven’t? Harry earned five times the\naverage, but is Harry five times smarter? No, not according to our personnel tests. I checked. They\nshow he’s about average in that department.\n“And did Harry work five times harder than you fellows? No—not according to the reports. In\nfact, he took more time off than most of you.\n“Did Harry have a better territory? Again I’ve got to say no. The accounts averaged about the\nsame. Did Harry have more education? Better health? Again, no. Harry is about as average as an\naverage guy could be except for one thing.\n“The difference between Harry and the rest of you,” said the vice president, “the difference is that\nHarry thought five times bigger.”\nThen the executive proceeded to show that success is determined not so much by the size of one’s\nbrain as it is \nby the size of one’s thinking.\nThis was an intriguing thought. And it stayed with me. The more I observed, the more people I\ntalked with, the deeper I dug into what’s really behind success, the clearer was the answer. Case\nhistory after case history proved that the size of bank accounts, the size of happiness accounts, and the\nsize of one’s general satisfaction account is dependent on \nthe size of one’s thinking.\n There \nis\n magic in\nthinking big.\n“If Thinking Big accomplishes so much, why doesn’t everyone think that way?” I’ve been asked\nthat question many times. Here, I believe, is the answer. All of us, more than we recognize, are\nproducts of the thinking around us. And much of this thinking is little, not big. All around you is an\nenvironment that is trying to tug you, trying to pull you down Second Class Street. You are told almost\ndaily that there are “too many chiefs and not enough Indians.” In other words, that opportunities to\nlead no longer exist, that there is a surplus of chiefs, so be content to be a little guy.\nBut this “too many chiefs” idea simply doesn’t square with the truth. Leading people in all\noccupations will tell you, as they’ve told me, that “the trouble is, there are too many Indians and not\nnearly enough chiefs.”\nThis pettily petty environment says other things too. It tells you, “Whatever will be will be,” that\n\f\nyour destiny is outside your control, that “fate” is in complete control. So forget those dreams, forget\nthat finer home, forget that special college for the children, forget the better life. Be resigned. Lie\ndown and wait to die.\nAnd who hasn’t heard the statement that “Success isn’t worth the price,” as if you have to sell\nyour soul, your family life, your conscience, your set of values to reach the top. But, in truth, success\ndoesn’t demand a price. Every step forward pays a dividend.\nThis environment also tells us there’s too much competition for the top spots in life. But is there?\nA personnel selection executive told me that he receives 50 to 250 times as many applicants for jobs\nthat pay $10,000 per year as for jobs that pay $50,000 a year. This is to say that there is at least 50\ntimes as much competition for jobs on Second Class Street as for jobs on First Class Avenue. First\nClass Avenue, U.S.A., is a short, uncrowded street. There are countless vacancies waiting there for\npeople like you who dare to think big.\nThe basic principles and concepts supporting \nThe Magic of Thinking Big\n come from the highest-\npedigree sources, the very finest and biggest-thinking minds yet to live on planet Earth. Minds like the\nprophet David, who wrote, “As one thinketh in his heart, so is he”; minds such as Emerson, who said,\n“Great men are those who see that thoughts rule the world”; minds like Milton, who in \nParadise Lost\nwrote, “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven.”\nAmazingly perceptive minds like Shakespeare, who observed, “There is nothing either good or bad\nexcept that thinking makes it so.”\nBut where does the proof come from? How do we know the master thinkers were right? Fair\nquestions. The proof comes from the lives of the select people around us who, through winning\nsuccess, achievement, and happiness, prove that thinking big \ndoes\n work magic.\nThe simple steps we have set down here are not untested theories. They are not one man’s guesses\nand opinions. They are proven approaches to life’s situations, and they are universally applicable\nsteps that work and work like magic.\nThat you’re reading this page proves you are interested in larger success. You want to fulfill your\ndesires. You want to enjoy a fine standard of living. You want this life to deliver to you all the good\nthings you deserve. Being interested in success is a wonderful quality.\nYou have another admirable quality. The fact that you’re holding this book in your hands shows\nyou have the intelligence to look for tools that will help take you where you want to go. In building\nanything—automobiles, bridges, missiles—we need tools. Many people, in their attempt to build a\nsuccessful life, forget there are tools to help them. You have not forgotten. You have, then, the two\nbasic qualities needed to realize real profit from this book: a desire for greater success and the\nintelligence to select a tool to help you realize that desire.\nThink Big and you’ll live big. You’ll live big in happiness. You’ll live big in accomplishment.\nBig in income. Big in friends. Big in respect.\nEnough for the promise.\nStart now, right now, to discover how to make your thinking make magic for you. Start out with\nthis thought of the great philosopher Disraeli: “Life is too short to be little.”\n\f\nWHAT THIS BOOK WILL DO FOR YOU\nIn every chapter of this book you will find dozens of hardheaded, practical ideas, techniques, and\nprinciples that will enable you to harness the tremendous power of thinking big, so as to gain for\nyourself the success, happiness, and satisfaction you want so much.

    "raw_text": "BELIEVE YOU CAN SUCCEED AND YOU\nWILL\nSuccess means many wonderful, positive things. Success means personal prosperity: a fine home,\nvacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success\nmeans winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life.\nSuccess means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-\nrespect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for\nthose who depend on you.\nSuccess means winning.\nSuccess—achievement—is the goal of life!\nEvery human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys\ncrawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way.\nSome of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that biblical quotation stating that\nfaith can move mountains.\nBelieve, really believe, you can move a mountain, and you can. Not many people believe that they\ncan move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do.\nOn some occasion you’ve probably heard someone say something like “It’s nonsense to think you\ncan make a mountain move away just by saying ‘Mountain, move away.’ It’s simply impossible.”\nPeople who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can’t\nwish\n away a mountain. You can’t \nwish\n yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into\na five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can’t wish yourself into a position\nof leadership.\nBut you \ncan\n move a mountain with belief. You \ncan\n win success by believing you can succeed.\nThere is nothing magical or mystical about the power of belief.\nBelief works this way. Belief, the “I’m-positive-I-can” attitude, generates the power, skill, and\nenergy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the \nhow\n-to-do-it develops.\nEvery day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them “wishes” that\nsomeday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young\npeople simply don’t have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don’t reach the top.\nBelieving it’s impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their\nbehavior remains that of the “average” person.\nBut a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their\nwork with the “I’m-going-to-the-top” attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top.\nBelieving they will succeed—and that it’s not impossible—these folks study and observe the\nbehavior of senior executives. They \nlearn how successful people approach problems and make\ndecisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people.\nThe how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it.\n\f\nA young woman I’m acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a\nsales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn’t—and couldn’t—do it.\nShe had less than $3,000 in savings and was advised that the minimum capital investment\nrequired was many times that.\n“Look how competitive it is,” she was advised. “And besides, what practical experience have\nyou had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?” her advisors asked.\nBut this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted that she\nlacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience.\n“But,” she said, “all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to\nexpand. On top of that, I’ve studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising\ntrailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I’m going to be on top in a\nhurry.”\nAnd she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she\ncould succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete\nbelief, she did the “impossible”—she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory\nwith no money down.\nLast year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers.\n“Next year,” she says, “I expect to gross over $2,000,000.”\nBelief, \nstrong belief\n, triggers the mind to figure ways and \nmeans and how-to. And believing you\ncan succeed makes others place confidence in you.\nMost people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, U.S.A.,\ndo! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a mid-\nwestern state related a “mountain-moving” experience to me.\n“Last month,” my friend began, “our department sent notices to a number of engineering\ncompanies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway-\nbuilding program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected\nwould get a 4 percent commission, or $200,000, for its design work.\n“I talked with twenty-one engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to\nsubmit proposals. The other seventeen companies were small, having only three to seven engineers\neach. The size of the project scared off sixteen of these seventeen. They went over the project, shook\ntheir heads, and said, in effect, ‘It’s too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it’s no use\neven trying.’\n“But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said,\n‘We can do it. We’ll submit a proposal.’ They did, and they got the job.”\nThose who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can’t, cannot. Belief\ntriggers the power to do.\nActually, in these modern times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The\nmost essential element—in fact, \nthe\n essential element—in our space explorations today is belief that\nspace can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man \ncan\n travel in space, our scientists\nwould not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief \nthat cancer can be cured will\nultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently, there is some talk of building a tunnel under the\nEnglish Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on\nwhether responsible people believe it can be built.\nBelief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific\ndiscoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization.\n\f\nBelief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient of successful people.\nBelieve, really believe, you can succeed, and you will.\nOver the years I’ve talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various\ncareers. I’ve heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds\nas conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like “To tell\nthe truth, I didn’t think it would work” or “I had my misgivings before I even started out” or\n“Actually, I wasn’t too surprised that it didn’t work out.”\nThe “Okay-I’ll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don’t-think-it-will-work” attitude produces failures.\nDisbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts “reasons” to\nsupport the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the \nsubconscious will to fail\n, the \nnot really wanting\n to\nsucceed, is responsible for most failures.\nThink doubt and fail.\nThink victory and succeed.\nA young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of\nthe top writers in her field came up.\n“Oh,” she said, “Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can’t be nearly as successful as he\nis.”\nHer attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not\nsuperintelligent nor superperceptive, nor super–anything else except superconfident. He believes he\nis among the best, and so he acts and performs the best.\nIt is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don’t worship him.\nBelieve you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are\ninvariably second-best doers.\nLook at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the\nfellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little.\nHe believes he can’t do big things, and he doesn’t. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he\ndoes has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way\nthe fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller\nand smaller, in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows\nsmaller in the estimation of the people around him.\nNow look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much,\nand he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments—and he does. Everything\nhe does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say,\n“Here is a professional. He is an important person.”\nA person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch\nyour success offensive \nwith honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big.\nSeveral years ago after addressing a group of businessmen in Detroit, I talked with one of the\ngentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, “I really enjoyed your talk. Can you\nspare a few minutes? I’d like very much to discuss a personal experience with you.”\nIn a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments.\n“I have a personal experience,” he began, “that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening\nabout making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I’ve never explained to\nanyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity, but I’d like to tell you about it.”\n“And I’d like to hear it,” I said.\n“Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die\n\f\ntrade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too\nsmall, and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn’t complain\nmuch, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside\nI grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two\nchildren, I really hurt inside.\n“But today things are really different,” my friend continued. “Today we have a beautiful new\nhome on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There’s no more\nworry about whether we can send the kids to a good college, and my wife no longer has to feel guilty\nevery time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole \nfamily is flying to Europe\nto spend a month’s holiday. We’re really living.”\n“How did this all happen?” I asked.\n“It all happened,” he continued, “when, to use the phrase you used tonight, ‘I harnessed the power\nof belief.’ Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were\nliving in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got\nhere early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday.\n“After dinner I sat down in my hotel room, and for some reason, I got really disgusted with\nmyself. ‘Why,’ I asked myself, ‘am I just a middle-class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that\nrepresents such a small step forward?’\n“I don’t know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and\nwrote down the names of five people I’ve known well for several years who had far surpassed me in\nearning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine\nsubdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law.\n“Next—again I don’t know what made me do this—I asked myself, what do my five friends have\nthat I don’t have, besides better jobs? I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly\ncouldn’t see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on\neducation, integrity, or personal habits.\n“Finally, I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about: initiative. Here I hated to\nadmit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends.\n“It was now about 3 \nA.M.\n, but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for\nthe first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself\ndeeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn’t believe inside that I\nwas worth very much.\n“I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever\nsince I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching\nto myself why I couldn’t get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this\nstreak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else\nwas going to believe in me until I believed in myself.\n“Right then I decided, ‘I’m through feeling second-class. From here on in I’m not going to sell\nmyself short.’\n“Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my newfound\nconfidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I’d hoped I would have courage to ask for\n$750 or maybe even $1,000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I \nwas\n a\nvaluable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-\nanalysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more salable.\n“Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get\n\f\nbusiness. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the\nbest business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial\namount of stock plus a lot more pay.”\nBelieve in yourself, and good things \ndo\n start happening.\n*\nYour mind is a “thought factory.” It’s a busy factory, producing countless thoughts in one day.\nProduction in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call\nMr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts.\nHe specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you’re qualified, why you will.\nThe other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, deprecating thoughts. He is your expert in\ndeveloping reasons why you can’t, why you’re weak, why you’re inadequate. His specialty is the\n“why-you-will-fail” chain of thoughts.\nBoth Mr. Triumph and Mr. Defeat are intensely obedient. They snap to attention immediately. All\nyou need do to signal either foreman is to give the slightest mental beck and call. If the signal is\npositive, Mr. Triumph will step forward and go to work. Likewise, a negative signal brings Mr.\nDefeat forward.\nTo see how these two foremen work for you, try this example. Tell yourself, “Today is a lousy\nday.” This signals Mr. Defeat into action, and he manufactures some facts to prove you are right. He\nsuggests to you that it’s too hot or it’s too cold, business will be bad today, sales will drop, other\npeople will be on edge, you may get sick, your wife will be in a fussy mood. Mr. Defeat is\ntremendously efficient. In just a few moments he’s got you sold. It \nis\n a bad day. Before you know it, it\nis a \nheck\n of a bad day.\nBut tell yourself, “Today is a fine day,” and Mr. Triumph is signaled forward to act. He tells you,\n“This \nis\n a \nwonderful\n day. The weather is refreshing. It’s good to be alive. Today you can catch up on\nsome of your work.” And then it is a good day.\nIn like fashion Mr. Defeat can show you why you can’t sell \nMr. Smith; Mr. Triumph will show you\nthat you can. Mr. Defeat will convince you that you will fail, while Mr. Triumph will demonstrate\nwhy you will succeed. Mr. Defeat will prepare a brilliant case against Tom, while Mr. Triumph will\nshow you more reasons why you like Tom.\nNow, the more work you give either of these two foremen, the stronger he becomes. If Mr. Defeat\nis given more work to do, he adds personnel and takes up more space in your mind. Eventually, he\nwill take over the entire thought-manufacturing division, and virtually all thought will be of a negative\nnature.\nThe only wise thing to do is fire Mr. Defeat. You don’t need him. You don’t want him around\ntelling you that you can’t, you’re not up to it, you’ll fail, and so on. Mr. Defeat won’t help you get\nwhere you want to go, so boot him out.\nUse Mr. Triumph 100 percent of the time. When any thought enters your mind, ask Mr. Triumph to\ngo to work for you. He’ll show you how you can succeed.\nBetween now and tomorrow at this time another 11,500 new consumers will have made their\ngrand entry into the U.S.A.\nPopulation is growing at a record rate. In the next ten years the increase is conservatively\nestimated at 35 million. That’s equal to the present combined metropolitan population of our five\nbiggest cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Philadelphia. Imagine!\n\f\nNew industries, new scientific breakthroughs, expanding markets—all spell opportunity. This is\ngood news. This is a most wonderful time to be alive!\nAll signs point to a record demand for top-level people in every field—people who have\nsuperior ability to influence others, to direct their work, to serve them in a leadership capacity. \nAnd\nthe people who will fill these leadership positions are all adults or near adults \nright now.\n One of\nthem is you.\nThe guarantee of a boom is not, of course, a guarantee of personal success. Over the long pull, the\nUnited States has always been booming. But just a fast glance shows that millions and millions of\npeople—in fact, a majority of them—struggle but don’t really succeed. The majority of folks still plug\nalong in mediocrity despite the record opportunity of the last two decades. And in the boom period\nahead, most people will continue to worry, to be afraid, to crawl through life feeling unimportant,\nunappreciated, not able to do what they want to do. As a result, their performance will earn them\npetty rewards, petty happiness.\nThose who convert opportunity into reward (and let me say, I sincerely believe you are one of\nthose, else you’d rely on luck and not bother with this book) will be those wise people who learn\nhow to think themselves to success.\nWalk in. The door to success is open wider than ever before. Put yourself on record now that you\nare going to join that select group that is getting what it wants from life.\nHere is the first step toward success. It’s a basic step. It can’t be avoided. Step One: Believe in\nyourself, believe you can succeed."

    "raw_text": "HOW TO DEVELOP THE POWER OF BELIEF\nHere are the three guides to acquiring and strengthening the power of belief:\n1. Think success, don’t think failure. At work, in your home, substitute success thinking for failure\nthinking. When you face a difficult situation, think, “I’ll win,” not “I’ll probably \nlose.” When you\ncompete with someone else, think, “I’m equal to the best,” not “I’m outclassed.” When opportunity\nappears, think “I can do it,” never “I can’t.” Let the master thought “I will succeed” dominate your\nthinking process. Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success.\nThinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other\nthoughts that produce failure.\n2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not\nsupermen. Success does not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success.\nAnd success isn’t based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed\nbelief in themselves and what they do. Never—yes, \nnever\n—sell yourself short.\n3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals\nand expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas\nand big plans are often easier—certainly no more difficult—than small ideas and small plans.\nMr. Ralph J. Cordiner, chairman of the board of the General Electric Company, said this to a\nleadership conference: “We need from every man who aspires to leadership—for himself and his\ncompany—a determination to undertake a personal program of self-development. Nobody is going to\norder\n a man to develop. . . . Whether a man lags behind or moves ahead in his specialty is a matter of\nhis own personal application. This is \nsomething which takes time, work, and sacrifice. Nobody can\ndo it for you.”\nMr. Cordiner’s advice is sound and practical. Live it. Persons who reach the top rungs in business\nmanagement, selling, engineering, religious work, writing, acting, and in every other pursuit get there\nby following conscientiously and continuously a \nplan for self-development and growth.\nAny training program—and that’s exactly what this book is—must do three things. It must provide\ncontent, the what-to-do. Second, it must supply a method, the how-to-do-it. And third, it must meet the\nacid test; that is, get results.\nThe \nwhat\n of your personal training program for success is built on the attitudes and techniques of\nsuccessful people. How do they manage themselves? How do they overcome obstacles? How do they\nearn the respect of others? What sets them apart from the ordinary? How do they think?\nThe \nhow\n of your plan for development and growth is a series of concrete guides for action. These\nare found in each chapter. These guides work. Apply them and see for yourself.\nWhat about the most important part of training: results? Wrapped up briefly, conscientious\napplication of the program presented here will bring you success and on a scale that may now look\nimpossible. Broken down into its components, your personal training program for success will bring\nyou a series of rewards: the reward of deeper respect from your family, the reward of admiration\nfrom your friends and associates, the reward of feeling useful, of being someone, of having status, the\nreward of increased income and a higher standard of living.\nYour training is self-administered. There will be no one standing over your shoulder telling you\n\f\nwhat to do and how to \ndo it. This book will be your guide, but only you can understand yourself. Only\nyou\n can command yourself to apply this training. Only \nyou\n can evaluate your progress. Only \nyou\n can\nbring about corrective action should you slip a little. In short, you are going to train yourself to\nachieve bigger and bigger success.\nYou already have a fully equipped laboratory in which you can work and study. Your laboratory is\nall around you. Your laboratory consists of human beings. This laboratory supplies you with every\npossible example of human action. And there is no limit to what you can learn once you see yourself\nas a scientist in your own lab. What’s more, there is nothing to buy. There is no rent to pay. There are\nno fees of any kind. You can use this laboratory as much as you like for free.\nAs director of your own laboratory, you will want to do what every scientist does: observe and\nexperiment.\nIsn’t it surprising to you that most people understand so little about why people act as they do\neven though they are surrounded by people all their lives? Most people are not trained observers.\nOne important purpose of this book is to help you train yourself to observe, to develop deep insight\ninto human action. You’ll want to ask yourself questions like “Why is John so successful and Tom just\ngetting by?” “Why do some people have many friends and other people have only few friends?” “Why\nwill people gladly accept what one person tells them but ignore another person who tells them the\nsame thing?”\nOnce trained, you will learn valuable lessons just through the very simple process of observing.\nHere are two special suggestions to help you make yourself a trained observer. Select for special\nstudy the most successful and the most unsuccessful person you know. Then, as the book \nunfolds,\nobserve how closely your successful friend adheres to the success principles. Notice also how\nstudying the two extremes will help you see the unmistakable wisdom of following the truths outlined\nin this book.\nEach contact you make with another person gives you a chance to see success development\nprinciples at work. Your objective is to make successful action habitual. The more we practice, the\nsooner it becomes second nature to act in the desired way.\nMost of us have friends who grow things for a hobby. And we’ve all heard them say something\nlike “It’s exciting to watch those plants grow. Just look how they respond to plant food and water. See\nhow much bigger they are today than they were last week.”\nTo be sure, it is thrilling to watch what can happen when men cooperate carefully with nature. But\nit is not one-tenth as fascinating as watching yourself respond to your own carefully administered\nthought management program. It’s fun to feel yourself growing more confident, more effective, more\nsuccessful day by day, month by month. Nothing—absolutely nothing—in this life gives you more\nsatisfaction than knowing you’re on the road to success and achievement. And nothing stands as a\nbigger challenge than making the most of yourself.\n\f\n2\n\f\nCURE YOURSELF OF EXCUSITIS, THE\nFAILURE DISEASE\nPeople—as you think yourself to success, that’s what you will study, people. You will study people\nvery carefully to discover, then apply, success-rewarding principles to your life. And you want to\nbegin right away.\nGo deep into your study of people, and you’ll discover unsuccessful people suffer a mind-\ndeadening thought disease. We call this disease \nexcusitis.\n Every failure has this disease in its\nadvanced form. And most “average” persons have at least a mild case of it.\nYou will discover that excusitis explains the difference between the person who is going places\nand the fellow who is barely holding his own. You will find that the more successful the individual,\nthe less inclined he is to make excuses.\nBut the fellow who has gone nowhere and has no plans for getting anywhere always has a bookful\nof reasons to explain why. Persons with mediocre accomplishments are quick to explain why they\nhaven’t, why they don’t, why they can’t, and why they aren’t.\nStudy the lives of successful people and you’ll discover this: all the excuses made by the\nmediocre fellow could be \nbut aren’t\n made by the successful person.\nI have never met nor heard of a highly successful business executive, military officer, salesman,\nprofessional person, or leader in any field who could not have found one or more major excuses to\nhide behind. Roosevelt could have hidden behind his lifeless legs; Truman could have used “no\ncollege education”; Kennedy could have said, “I’m too young to be president”; Johnson and\nEisenhower could have ducked behind heart attacks.\nLike any disease, excusitis gets worse if it isn’t treated properly. A victim of this thought disease\ngoes through this mental process: “I’m not doing as well as I should. What can I use as an alibi that\nwill help me save face? Let’s see: poor health? lack of education? too old? too young? bad luck?\npersonal misfortune? wife? the way my family brought me up?”\nOnce the victim of this failure disease has selected a “good” excuse, he sticks with it. Then he\nrelies on the excuse to explain to himself and others why he is not going forward.\nAnd each time the victim makes the excuse, the excuse becomes imbedded deeper within his\nsubconsciousness. Thoughts, positive or negative, grow stronger when fertilized with constant\nrepetition. At first the victim of excusitis knows his alibi is more or less a lie. But the more frequently\nhe repeats it, the more convinced he becomes that it is completely true, that the alibi is the real reason\nfor his not being the success he should be.\nProcedure One, then, in your individual program of thinking yourself to success, must be to\nvaccinate yourself against excusitis, the disease of the failures."

    "raw_text": "THE FOUR MOST COMMON FORMS OF EXCUSITIS\nExcusitis appears in a wide variety of forms, but the worst types of this disease are health excusitis,\nintelligence excusitis, age \nexcusitis, and luck excusitis. Now let’s see just how we can protect\nourselves from these four common ailments.\n1. “But My Health Isn’t Good.”\nHealth excusitis ranges all the way from the chronic “I don’t feel good” to the more specific “I’ve got\nsuch-and-such wrong with me.”\n“Bad” health, in a thousand different forms, is used as an excuse for failing to do what a person\nwants to do, failing to accept greater responsibilities, failing to make more money, failing to achieve\nsuccess.\nMillions and millions of people suffer from health excusitis. But is it, in most cases, a legitimate\nexcuse? Think for a moment of all the highly successful people you know who could—but who don’t\n—use health as an excuse.\nMy physician and surgeon friends tell me the perfect specimen of adult life is nonexistent. There\nis something physically wrong with everybody. Many surrender in whole or in part to health excusitis,\nbut success-thinking people do not.\nTwo experiences happened to me in one afternoon that illustrate the correct and incorrect attitudes\ntoward health. I had just finished a talk in Cleveland. Afterwards, one fellow, about thirty, asked to\nspeak to me privately for a few minutes. He complimented me on the meeting but then said, “I’m\nafraid your ideas can’t do me much good.”\n“You see,” he continued, “I’ve got a bad heart, and I’ve got to hold myself in check.” He went on\nto explain that he’d seen four doctors but they couldn’t find his trouble. He asked me what I would\nsuggest he do.\n“Well,” I said, “I know nothing about the heart, but as one \nlayman to another, here are three things\nI’d do. First, I’d visit the finest heart specialist I could find and accept his diagnosis as final. You’ve\nalready checked with four doctors, and none of them has found anything peculiar with your heart. Let\nthe fifth doctor be your final check. It may very well be you’ve got a perfectly sound heart. But if you\nkeep on worrying about it, eventually you may have a very serious heart ailment. Looking and looking\nand looking for an illness often actually produces illness.\n“The second thing I’d recommend is that you read Dr. Schindler’s great book, \nHow to Live 365\nDays a Year.\n Dr. Schindler shows in this book that three out of every four hospital beds are occupied\nby people who have EII—Emotionally Induced Illness. Imagine, three out of four people who are sick\nright now would be well if they had learned how to handle their emotions. Read Dr. Schindler’s book\nand develop your program for ‘emotions management.’\n“Third, I’d resolve to live until I die.” I went on to explain to this troubled fellow some sound\nadvice I received many years ago from a lawyer friend who had an arrested case of tuberculosis. This\nfriend knew he would have to live a regulated life but this hasn’t stopped him from practicing law,\nrearing a fine family, and really enjoying life. My friend, who now is seventy-eight years old,\nexpresses his philosophy in these words: “I’m going to live until I die and I’m not going to get life\nand death confused. While I’m on this earth I’m going to \nlive.\n Why be only half alive? Every minute a\nperson spends worrying about dying is just one minute that fellow might as well have been dead.”\nI had to leave at that point, because I had to be on a certain plane for Detroit. On the plane the\nsecond but much more pleasant \nexperience occurred. After the noise of the takeoff, I heard a ticking\n\f\nsound. Rather startled, I glanced at the fellow sitting beside me, for the sound seemed to be coming\nfrom him.\nHe smiled a big smile and said, “Oh, it’s not a bomb. It’s just my heart.”\nI was obviously surprised, so he proceeded to tell me what had happened.\nJust twenty-one days before, he had undergone an operation that involved putting a plastic valve\ninto his heart. The ticking sound, he explained, would continue for several months, until new tissue\nhad grown over the artificial valve. I asked him what he was going to do.\n“Oh,” he said, “I’ve got big plans. I’m going to study law when I get back to Minnesota. Someday\nI hope to be in government work. The doctors tell me I must take it easy for a few months, but after\nthat I’ll be like new.”\nThere you have two ways of meeting health problems. The first fellow, not even sure he had\nanything organically wrong with him, was worried, depressed, on the road to defeat, wanting\nsomebody to second his motion that he couldn’t go forward. The second individual, after undergoing\none of the most difficult of operations, was optimistic, eager to do something. The difference lay in\nhow they thought toward health!\nI’ve had some very direct experience with health excusitis. I’m a diabetic. Right after I\ndiscovered I had this ailment (about 5,000 hypodermics ago), I was warned, “Diabetes \nis\n a physical\ncondition; but the biggest damage results from having a negative attitude toward it. Worry about it,\nand you may have real trouble.”\nNaturally, since the discovery of my own diabetes, I’ve gotten to know a great many other\ndiabetics. Let me tell you about two extremes. One fellow who has a very mild case belongs to that\nfraternity of the living dead. Obsessed with a fear of the weather, he is usually ridiculously bundled\nup. He’s afraid of infection, so he shuns anybody who has the slightest sniffle. He’s afraid of\noverexertion, so he does almost nothing. He spends most of his mental energy worrying about what\nmight\n happen. He bores other people telling them “how awful” his problem really is. His real ailment\nis not diabetes. Rather, he’s a victim of health excusitis. He has pitied himself into being an invalid.\nThe other extreme is a division manager for a large publishing company. He has a severe case; he\ntakes about thirty times as much insulin as the fellow mentioned above. But he is not living to be sick.\nHe is living to enjoy his work and have fun. One day he said to me, “Sure it is an inconvenience, but\nso is shaving. But I’m \nnot\n going to think myself to bed. When I take those shots, I just praise the guys\nwho discovered insulin.”\nA good friend of mine, a widely known college educator, came home from Europe in 1945 minus\none arm. Despite his handicap, John is always smiling, always helping others. He’s about as\noptimistic as anyone I know. One day he and I had a long talk about his handicap.\n“It’s just an arm,” he said, “Sure, two \nare\n better than one. But they just cut off my arm. My spirit is\none hundred percent intact. I’m really grateful for that.”\nAnother amputee friend is an excellent golfer. One day I asked him how he had been able to\ndevelop such a near-perfect style with just one arm. I mentioned that most golfers with two arms can’t\ndo nearly as well. His reply says a lot. “Well, it’s my \nexperience,” he said, “that the right attitude and\none arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.” \nThe right attitude and one arm will\nbeat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.\n Think about that for a while. It holds true not only\non the golf course but in every facet of life.\nFour Things You Can Do to Lick Health Excusitis\nThe best vaccine against health excusitis consists of these four doses:\n\f\n1. Refuse to talk about your health. The more you talk about an ailment, even the common cold, the\nworse it seems to get. Talking about bad health is like putting fertilizer on weeds. Besides, talking\nabout your health is a bad habit. It bores people. It makes one appear self-centered and old-\nmaidish. Success-minded people defeat the natural tendency to talk about their “bad” health. One\nmay (and let me emphasize the word \nmay\n) get a little sympathy, but one doesn’t get respect and\nloyalty by being a chronic complainer.\n2. Refuse to worry about your health. Dr. Walter Alvarez, emeritus consultant to the world-famous\nMayo Clinic, wrote recently, “I always beg worriers to exercise some self-control. For instance,\nwhen I saw this man (a fellow who was convinced he had a diseased gallbladder although eight\nseparate X-ray examinations showed that the organ was perfectly normal), I begged him to quit\ngetting his gallbladder X-rayed. I have begged hundreds of heart-conscious men to quit getting\nelectrocardiograms made.”\n3. Be genuinely grateful that your health is as good as it is. There’s an old saying worth repeating\noften: “I felt sorry for myself because I had ragged shoes until I met a man who had no feet.”\nInstead of complaining about “not feeling good,” it’s far better to be glad you are as healthy as you\nare. Just being grateful for the health you have is powerful vaccination against developing new\naches and pains and real illness.\n4. Remind yourself often, “It’s better to wear out than rust out.” Life is yours to enjoy. Don’t waste it.\nDon’t pass up living by thinking yourself into a hospital bed.\n2. “But You’ve Got to Have Brains to Succeed.”\nIntelligence excusitis, or “I lack brains,” is common. In fact, it’s so common that perhaps as many as\n95 percent of the people around us have it in varying degrees. Unlike most other types of excusitis,\npeople suffering from this particular type of the malady suffer in silence. Not many people will admit\nopenly that they think they lack adequate intelligence. Rather, they feel it deep down inside.\nMost of us make two basic errors with respect to intelligence:\n1. We underestimate our own brainpower.\n2. We overestimate the other fellow’s brainpower.\nBecause of these errors many people sell themselves short. They fail to tackle challenging\nsituations because it “takes a brain.” But along comes the fellow who isn’t concerned about\nintelligence, and he gets the job.\nWhat really matters is not how much intelligence you have but how you use what you do have.\nThe thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than the quantity of your\nbrainpower. Let me repeat, for this is vitally important: \nthe thinking that guides your intelligence is\nmuch more important than how much intelligence you may have.\nIn answering the question, “Should your child be a scientist?” Dr. Edward Teller, one of the\nnation’s foremost physicists, said, “A child does not need a lightning-fast mind to be a scientist, nor\ndoes he need a miraculous memory, nor is it necessary that he get very high grades in school. The only\n\f\npoint that counts is that the child have a high degree of interest in science.”\nInterest, enthusiasm, is the critical factor even in science!\nWith a positive, optimistic, and cooperative attitude a person with an IQ of 100 will earn more\nmoney, win more respect, and achieve more success than a negative, pessimistic, uncooperative\nindividual with an IQ of 120.\nJust enough sense to stick with something—a chore, task, project—until it’s completed pays off\nmuch better than \nidle\n intelligence, even if idle intelligence be of genius caliber.\nFor \nstickability\n is 95 percent of \nability.\nAt a homecoming celebration last year I met a college friend whom I had not seen for ten years.\nChuck was a very bright student and was graduated with honors. His goal when I last saw him was to\nown his own business in western Nebraska.\nI asked Chuck what kind of business he finally established.\n“Well,” he confessed, “I didn’t go into business for myself. I wouldn’t have said this to anyone\nfive years ago or even one year ago, but now I’m ready to talk about it.\n“As I look back at my college education now, I see that I became an expert in why a business idea\nwon’t work out. I learned every conceivable pitfall, every reason why a small business \nwill\n fail:\n‘You’ve got to have ample capital;’ ‘Be sure the business cycle is right;’ ‘Is there a big demand for\nwhat you will offer?’ ‘Is local industry stabilized?’—a thousand and one things to check out.\n“The thing that hurts most is that several of my old high school friends who never seemed to have\nmuch on the ball and didn’t even go to college now are very well established in their own businesses.\nBut me, I’m just plodding along, auditing freight shipments. Had I been drilled a little more in why a\nsmall business \ncan\n succeed, I’d be better off in every way today.”\nThe \nthinking\n that guided Chuck’s intelligence was a lot more important than the \namount\n of\nChuck’s intelligence.\nWhy some brilliant people are failures.\n I’ve been close for many years to a person who qualifies\nas a genius, has high abstract intelligence, and is Phi Beta Kappa. Despite this very high native\nintelligence, he is one of the most unsuccessful people I know. He has a very mediocre job (he’s\nafraid of responsibility). He has never married (lots of marriages end in divorce). He has few friends\n(people bore him). He’s never invested in property of any kind (he might lose his money). This man\nuses his great brainpower to prove why things won’t work rather than directing his mental power to\nsearching for ways to succeed.\nBecause of the negative thinking that guides his great reservoir of brains, this fellow contributes\nlittle and creates nothing. With a changed attitude, he could do great things indeed. He has the brains\nto be a tremendous success, but not the thought power.\nAnother person I know well was inducted into the Army shortly after earning the Ph.D. degree\nfrom a leading New York university. How did he spend his three years in the Army? Not as an officer.\nNot as a staff specialist. Instead, for three years he drove a truck. Why? Because he was filled with\nnegative attitudes toward fellow soldiers (“I’m superior to them”), toward army methods and\nprocedures (“They are stupid”), toward discipline (“It’s for others, not me”), toward everything,\nincluding himself (“I’m a fool for not figuring out a way to escape this rap”).\nThis fellow earned no respect from anyone. All his vast store of knowledge lay buried. His\nnegative attitudes turned him into a flunky.\nRemember, the thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much\nintelligence you have. Not even a Ph.D. degree can override this basic success principle!\nSeveral years ago I became a close friend of Phil F., one of the senior officers of a major\n\f\nadvertising agency. Phil was director of marketing research for the agency, and he was doing a bang-\nup job.\nWas Phil a “brain”? Far from it. Phil knew next to nothing about research technique. He knew next\nto nothing about statistics. He was not a college graduate (though all the people working for him\nwere). And Phil did not \npretend\n to know the technical side of research. What, then, enabled Phil to\ncommand $30,000 a year while not one of his subordinates earned $10,000?\nThis: Phil was a “human” engineer. Phil was 100 percent positive. Phil could inspire others when\nthey felt low. Phil was enthusiastic. He generated enthusiasm; Phil understood people, and, because\nhe could really see what made them tick, he liked them.\nNot Phil’s brains, but how he managed those brains, made him three times more valuable to his\ncompany than men who rated higher on the IQ scale.\nOut of every 100 persons who enroll in college, fewer than 50 will graduate. I was curious about\nthis so I asked a director of admissions at a large university for his explanation.\n“It’s not insufficient intelligence,” he said. “We don’t admit them if they don’t have sufficient\nability. And it’s not money. Anyone who wants to support himself in college today can do so. The real\nreason is attitudes. You would be surprised,” he said, “how many young people leave because they\ndon’t like their professors, the subjects they must take, and their fellow students.”\nThe same reason, negative thinking, explains why the door to top-flight executive positions is\nclosed to many young junior executives. Sour, negative, pessimistic, depreciating attitudes rather than\ninsufficient intelligence hold back thousands of young executives. As one executive told me, “It’s a\nrare case when we pass up a young fellow because he lacks brains. Nearly always it’s attitude.”\nOnce I was retained by an insurance company to learn why the top 25 percent of the agents were\nselling over 75 percent of the insurance while the bottom 25 percent of the agents sold only 5 percent\nof total volume.\nThousands of personnel files were carefully checked. The search proved beyond any question that\nno significant difference existed in native intelligence. What’s more, differences in education did not\nexplain the difference in selling success. The difference in the very successful and the very\nunsuccessful finally reduced to differences in \nattitudes\n, or difference in thought management. \nThe top\ngroup worried less, was more enthusiastic, had a sincere liking for people.\nWe can’t do much to change the amount of native ability, but we can certainly change the way we\nuse what we have.\nKnowledge is power—when you use it constructively.\n Closely allied to intelligence excusitis is\nsome incorrect thinking about knowledge. We often hear that knowledge is power. But this statement\nis only a half-truth. Knowledge is only potential power. Knowledge is power only when put to use—\nand then only when the use made of it is constructive.\nThe story is told that the great scientist Einstein was once asked how many feet are in a mile.\nEinstein’s reply was “I don’t know. Why should I fill my brain with facts I can find in two minutes in\nany standard reference book?”\nEinstein taught us a big lesson. He felt it was more important to use your mind \nto think\n than to use\nit as a warehouse for facts.\nOne time Henry Ford was involved in a libel suit with the \nChicago Tribune.\n The \nTribune\n had\ncalled Ford an ignoramus, and Ford said, in effect, “Prove it.”\nThe \nTribune\n asked him scores of simple questions such as “Who was Benedict Arnold?” “When\nwas the Revolutionary War fought?” and others, most of which Ford, who had little formal education,\n\f\ncould not answer.\nFinally he became quite exasperated and said, “I don’t know the answers to those questions, but I\ncould find a man in five minutes who does.”\nHenry Ford was never interested in miscellaneous information. He knew what every major\nexecutive knows: that the ability \nto know how to get information is more important than using the\nmind as a garage for facts.\nHow much is a fact man worth?\n I spent a very interesting evening recently with a friend who is the\npresident of a young but rapidly growing manufacturing concern. The TV set happened to be turned to\none of the most popular quiz programs. The fellow being quizzed had been on the show for several\nweeks. He could answer questions on all sorts of subjects, many of which seemed nonsensical.\nAfter the fellow answered a particularly odd question, something about a mountain in Argentina,\nmy host looked at me and said, “How much do you think I’d pay that guy to work for me?”\n“How much?” I asked.\n“Not a cent over $300—not per week, not per month, but for life. I’ve sized him up. That ‘expert’\ncan’t think. He can only memorize. He’s just a human encyclopedia, and I figure for $300 I can buy a\npretty good set of encyclopedias. In fact, maybe that’s too much. Ninety percent of what that guy\nknows I can find in a $2 almanac.\n“What I want around me,” he continued, “are people who can solve problems, who can think up\nideas. People who can dream and then develop the dream into a practical application; an idea man\ncan make money with me; a fact man can’t.”\nThree Ways to Cure Intelligence Excusitis\nThree easy ways to cure intelligence excusitis are:\n1. Never underestimate your own intelligence, and never overestimate the intelligence of others.\nDon’t sell yourself \nshort. Concentrate on your assets. Discover your superior talents. Remember,\nit’s not how many brains you’ve got that matters. Rather, it’s how you use your brains that counts.\nManage your brains instead of worrying about how much IQ you’ve got.\n2. Remind yourself several times daily, “My attitudes are more important than my intelligence.” At\nwork and at home practice positive attitudes. See the reasons why you can do it, not the reasons\nwhy you can’t. Develop an “I’m winning” attitude. Put your intelligence to creative positive use.\nUse it to find ways to win, not to prove you will lose.\n3. Remember that the ability to \nthink\n is of much greater value than the ability to memorize facts. Use\nyour mind to create and develop ideas, to find new and better ways to do things. Ask yourself, “Am\nI using my mental ability to make history, or am I using it merely to record history made by others?”\n3. “It’s No Use. I’m Too Old (or Too Young).”\nAge excusitis, the failure disease of never being the right age, comes in two easily identifiable forms:\nthe “I’m too old” variety and the “I’m too young” brand.\nYou’ve heard hundreds of people of all ages explain their mediocre performance in life something\nlike this: “I’m too old (or too young) to break in now. I can’t do what I want to do or am capable of"

    "raw_text": "doing because of my age handicap.”\nReally, it’s surprising how few people feel they are “just right” age-wise. And it’s unfortunate.\nThis excuse has closed the \ndoor of real opportunity to thousands of individuals. They think their age\nis wrong, so they don’t even bother to try.\nThe “I’m too old” variety is the most common form of age excusitis. This disease is spread in\nsubtle ways. TV fiction is produced about the big executive who lost his job because of a merger and\ncan’t find another because he’s too old. Mr. Executive looks for months to find another job, but he\ncan’t, and in the end, after contemplating suicide for a while, he decides to rationalize that it’s nice to\nbe on the shelf.\nPlays and magazine articles on the topic “Why You Are Washed Up at 40” are popular, not\nbecause they represent true facts, but because they appeal to many worried minds looking for an\nexcuse.\nHow to Handle Age Excusitis\nAge excusitis can be cured. A few years ago, while I was conducting a sales training program, I\ndiscovered a good serum that both cures this disease and vaccinates you so you won’t get it in the\nfirst place.\nIn that training program there was a trainee named Cecil. Cecil, who was forty, wanted to shift\nover to set himself up as a manufacturer’s representative, but he thought he was too old. “After all,”\nhe explained, “I’d have to start from scratch. And I’m too old for that now. I’m forty.”\nI talked with Cecil several times about his “old age” problem. I used the old medicine, “You’re\nonly as old as you feel,” but I found I was getting nowhere. (Too often people retort with “But I \ndo\nfeel old!”)\nFinally, I discovered a method that worked. One day after \na training session, I tried it on Cecil. I\nsaid, “Cecil, when does a man’s productive life begin?”\nHe thought a couple of seconds and answered, “Oh, when he’s about twenty, I guess.”\n“Okay,” I said, “now, when does a man’s productive life end?”\nCecil answered, “Well, if he stays in good shape and likes his work, I guess a man is still pretty\nuseful when he’s seventy or so.”\n“All right,” I said, “a lot of folks are highly productive after they reach seventy, but let’s agree\nwith what you’ve just said, a man’s productive years stretch from twenty to seventy. That’s fifty years\nin between, or half a century. Cecil,” I said, “you’re forty. How many years of productive life have\nyou spent?”\n“Twenty,” he answered.\n“And how many have you left?”\n“Thirty,” he replied.\n“In other words, Cecil, you haven’t even reached the halfway point; you’ve used up only forty\npercent of your productive years.”\nI looked at Cecil and realized he’d gotten the point. He was cured of age excusitis. Cecil saw he\nstill had many opportunity-filled years left. He switched from thinking “I’m already old” to “I’m still\nyoung.” Cecil now realized that how old we are is not important. It’s one’s attitude toward age that\nmakes it a blessing or a barricade.\nCuring yourself of age excusitis often opens doors to opportunities that you thought were locked\ntight. A relative of mine spent years doing many different things—selling, operating his own business,\nworking in a bank—but he never quite found \nwhat he really wanted to do most. Finally, he concluded\n\f\nthat the one thing he wanted more than anything else was to be a minister. But when he thought about\nit, he found he was too old. After all, he was forty-five, had three young children and little money.\nBut fortunately he mustered all of his strength and told himself, “Forty-five or not, I’m going to be\na minister.”\nWith tons of faith but little else, he enrolled in a five-year ministerial training program in\nWisconsin. Five years later he was ordained as a minister and settled down with a fine congregation\nin Illinois.\nOld? Of course not. He still has twenty years of productive life ahead of him. I talked with this\nman not long ago, and he said to me, “You know, if I had not made that great decision when I was\nforty-five, I would have spent the rest of my life growing old and bitter. Now I feel every bit as young\nas I did twenty-five years ago.”\nAnd he almost looked it, too. When you lick age excusitis, the natural result is to gain the\noptimism of youth and feel of youth. When you beat down your fears of age limitations, you add years\nto your life as well as success.\nA former university colleague of mine provides an interesting angle on how age excusitis was\ndefeated. Bill was graduated from Harvard in the 1920s. After twenty-four years in the\nstockbrokerage business, during which time he made a modest fortune, Bill decided he wanted to\nbecome a college professor. Bill’s friends warned him that he would overtax himself in the rugged\nlearning program ahead. But Bill was determined to reach his goal and enrolled in the University of\nIllinois—at the age of fifty-one. At fifty-five he had earned his degree. Today Bill \nis chairman of the\nDepartment of Economics at a fine liberal arts college. He’s happy, too. He smiles when he says,\n“I’ve got almost a third of my good years left.”\nOld age is a failure disease. Defeat it by refusing to let it hold you back.\nWhen is a person too young?\n The “I’m too young” variety of age excusitis does much damage, too.\nAbout a year ago, a twenty-three-year-old fellow named Jerry came to me with a problem. Jerry was\na fine young man. He had been a paratrooper in the service and then had gone to college. While going\nto college, Jerry supported his wife and son by selling for a large transfer-and-storage company. He\nhad done a terrific job, both in college and for his company.\nBut today Jerry was worried. “Dr. Schwartz,” he said, “I’ve got a problem. My company has\noffered me the job of sales manager. This would make me supervisor over eight salesmen.”\n“Congratulations, that’s wonderful news!” I said. “But you seem worried.”\n“Well,” he continued, “all eight men I’m to supervise are from seven to twenty-one years older\nthan I. What do you think I should do? Can I handle it?”\n“Jerry,” I said, “the general manager of your company obviously thinks you’re old enough or he\nwouldn’t have offered you this job. Just remember these three points and everything will work out\njust fine: first, don’t be age conscious. Back on the farm a boy became a man when he proved he\ncould do the work of a man. His number of birthdays had nothing to do with it. And this applies to\nyou. When you prove you are able \nto handle the job of sales manager, you’re automatically old\nenough.\n“Second, don’t take advantage of your new ‘gold bars.’ Show respect for the salesmen. Ask them\nfor their suggestions. Make them feel they are working for a team captain, not a dictator. Do this and\nthe men will work with you, not against you.\n“Third, get used to having older persons working for you. Leaders in all fields soon find they are\nyounger than many of the people they supervise. So get used to having older men work for you. It will\n\f\nhelp you a lot in the coming years, when even bigger opportunities develop.\n“And remember, Jerry, your age won’t be a handicap unless you make it one.”\nToday Jerry’s doing fine. He loves the transportation business, and now he’s planning to organize\nhis own company in a few years.\nYouth is a liability only when the youth thinks it is. You often hear that certain jobs require\n“considerable” physical maturity, jobs like selling securities and insurance. That you’ve got to have\neither gray hair or no hair at all in order to gain an investor’s confidence is plain nonsense. What\nreally matters is how well you know your job. If you know your job and understand people, you’re\nsufficiently mature to handle it. Age has no real relation to ability, unless you convince yourself that\nyears alone will give you the stuff you need to make your mark.\nMany young people feel that they are being held back because of their youth. Now, it is true that\nanother person in an organization who is insecure and job-scared may try to block your way forward,\nusing age or some other reason.\nBut the people who really count in the company will not. \nThey will give you as much\nresponsibility as they feel you can handle well. Demonstrate that you have ability and positive\nattitudes and your youthfulness will be considered an advantage.\nIn quick recap, the cure for age excusitis is:\n1. Look at your present age positively. Think, “I’m still young,” not “I’m already old.” Practice\nlooking forward to new horizons and gain the enthusiasm and the feel of youth.\n2. Compute how much productive time you have left. Remember, a person age thirty still has 80\npercent of his productive life ahead of him. And the fifty-year-old still has a big 40 percent—the best\n40 percent—of his opportunity years left. Life is actually longer than most people think!\n3. Invest future time in doing what you really want to do. It’s too late only when you let your mind\ngo negative and think it’s too late. Stop thinking “I should have started years ago.” That’s failure\nthinking. Instead think, “I’m going to start now, my best years are ahead of me.” That’s the way\nsuccessful people think.\n4. “But My Case Is Different; I Attract Bad Luck.”\nRecently, I heard a traffic engineer discuss highway safety. He pointed out that upward of 40,000\npersons are killed each year in so-called traffic accidents. The main point of his talk was that there is\nno such thing as a true accident. What we call an accident is the result of human or mechanical failure,\nor a combination of both.\nWhat this traffic expert was saying substantiates what wise men throughout the ages have said:\nthere is a cause for everything.\n Nothing happens without a cause. There is nothing accidental about\nthe weather outside today. It is the result of specific causes. \nAnd there is no reason to believe that\nhuman affairs are an exception.\nYet hardly a day passes that you do not hear someone blame his problems on “bad” luck. And it’s\na rare day that you do not hear someone attribute \nanother\n person’s success to “good” luck.\nLet me illustrate how people succumb to luck excusitis. I lunched recently with three young junior\nexecutives. The topic of conversation that day was George C., who just yesterday had been picked\nfrom among their group for a major promotion.\nWhy did George get the position? These three fellows dug up all sorts of reasons: luck, pull,\nbootlicking, George’s wife and how she flattered the boss, everything but the truth. The facts were\nthat George was simply better qualified. He had been doing a better job. He was working harder. He\n\f\nhad a more effective personality.\nI also knew that the senior officers in the company had spent much time considering which one of\nthe four would be promoted. My three disillusioned friends should have realized that top executives\ndon’t select major executives by drawing names from a hat.\nI was talking about the seriousness of luck excusitis not long ago with a sales executive of a\nmachine tool–manufacturing company. He became excited about the problem and began to talk about\nhis own experience with it.\n“I’ve never heard it called that before,” he said, “but it is one of the most difficult problems every\nsales executive has to wrestle with. Just yesterday a perfect example of what you’re talking about\nhappened in my company.\n“One of the salesmen walked in about four o’clock with a $112,000 order for machine tools.\nAnother salesman, whose \nvolume is so low he’s a problem, was in the office at the time. Hearing\nJohn tell the good news, he rather enviously congratulated him and then said, ‘Well, John, you’re\nlucky again!’\n“Now, what the weak salesman won’t accept is that luck had nothing to do with John’s big order.\nJohn had been working on that customer for months. He had talked repeatedly to a half-dozen people\nout there. John had stayed up nights figuring out exactly what was best for them. Then he got our\nengineers to make preliminary designs of the equipment. John wasn’t lucky, unless you can call\ncarefully planned work and patiently executed plans \nluck.\n”\nSuppose luck were used to reorganize General Motors.\n If luck determined who does what and who\ngoes where, every business in the nation would fall apart. Assume for a moment that General Motors\nwere to be completely reorganized on the basis of luck. To carry out the reorganization, the names of\nall employees would be placed in a barrel. The first name drawn would be president; the second\nname, the executive vice president, and so on down the line.\nSounds stupid, doesn’t it? Well, that’s how luck would work.\nPeople who rise to the top in any occupation—business management, selling, law, engineering,\nacting, or what have you—get there because they have superior attitudes and use their good sense in\napplied hard work.\nConquer Luck Excusitis in Two Ways\n1. Accept the law of cause and effect. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “good\nluck.” You’ll find that \nnot luck but preparation, planning, and success-producing thinking preceded\nhis good fortune. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “bad luck.” Look, and you’ll\ndiscover certain specific reasons. Mr. Success receives a setback; he learns and profits. But when\nMr. Mediocre loses, he fails to learn.\n2. Don’t be a wishful thinker. Don’t waste your mental muscles dreaming of an effortless way to win\nsuccess. We don’t become successful simply through luck. Success comes from doing those things\nand mastering those principles that produce success. Don’t count on luck for promotions, victories,\nthe good things in life. Luck simply isn’t designed to deliver these good things. Instead, just\nconcentrate on developing those qualities in yourself that will make you a winner.\n\f\n3"

    "raw_text": "BUILD CONFIDENCE AND DESTROY\nFEAR\nFriends mean well when they say, “It’s only your imagination. Don’t worry. There’s nothing to be\nafraid of.”\nBut you and I know this kind of fear medicine never really works. Such soothing remarks may\ngive us fear relief for a few minutes or maybe even a few hours. But the “it’s-only-in-your-\nimagination” treatment doesn’t really build confidence and cure fear.\nYes, fear is real. And we must recognize it exists before we can conquer it.\nMost fear today is psychological. Worry, tension, embarrassment, panic all stem from\nmismanaged, negative imagination. But simply knowing the breeding ground of fear doesn’t cure fear.\nIf a physician discovers you have an infection in some part of your body, he doesn’t stop there. He\nproceeds with treatment to cure the infection.\nThe old “it’s-only-in-your-mind” treatment presumes fear doesn’t really exist. But it \ndoes.\n Fear is\nreal.\n Fear is success enemy number one. Fear stops people from capitalizing on opportunity; fear\nwears down physical vitality; fear actually makes people sick, \ncauses organic difficulties, shortens\nlife; fear closes your mouth when you want to speak.\nFear—uncertainty, lack of confidence—explains why we still have economic recessions. Fear\nexplains why millions of people accomplish little and enjoy little.\nTruly, fear is a powerful force. In one way or another fear prevents people from getting what they\nwant from life.\nFear of all kinds and sizes is a form of psychological infection. We can cure a mental infection the\nsame way we cure a body infection—with specific, proved treatments.\nFirst, though, as part of your pretreatment preparation, condition yourself with this fact: all\nconfidence is acquired, developed. No one is born with confidence. Those people you know who\nradiate confidence, who have conquered worry, who are at ease everywhere and all the time,\nacquired their confidence, every bit of it.\nYou can, too. This chapter shows how.\n*\nDuring World War II the Navy made sure that all of its new recruits either knew how to swim or\nlearned how—the idea being, of course, that the ability to swim might someday save the sailor’s life\nat sea.\nNonswimming recruits were put into swimming classes. I watched a number of these training\nexperiences. In a superficial sort of way, it was amusing to see young, healthy men terrified by a few\nfeet of water. One of the exercises I recall required the new sailor to jump—not dive—from a board\nsix feet in the air into eight or more feet of water while a half-dozen expert swimmers stood by."

    "raw_text": "In a deeper sense, it was a sad sight. The fear those young \nmen displayed was \nreal.\n Yet all that\nstood between them and the defeat of that fear was one drop into the water below. On more than one\noccasion I saw young men “accidentally” pushed off the board. The result: fear defeated.\nThis incident, familiar to thousands of former Navy men, illustrates just one point: action cures\nfear. Indecision, postponement, on the other hand, fertilize fear.\nJot that down in your success rule book right now. \nAction cures fear.\nAction \ndoes\n cure fear. Several months ago a very troubled executive in his early forties came to\nsee me. He had a responsible job as a buyer for a large retailing organization.\nWorriedly, he explained, “I’m afraid of losing my job. I’ve got that feeling that my days are\nnumbered.”\n“Why?” I asked.\n“Well, the pattern is against me. Sales figures in my department are off seven percent from a year\nago. This is pretty bad, especially since the store’s total sales are up six percent. I’ve made a couple\nof unwise decisions recently, and I’ve been singled out several times by the merchandise manager for\nnot keeping pace with the company’s progress.\n“I’ve never felt quite like this before,” he continued. “I’ve lost my grip, and it shows. My\nassistant buyer senses it. The salespeople see it, too. Other executives, of course, are aware that I’m\nslipping. One buyer even suggested at a meeting of all head buyers the other day that part of my line\nshould be put in his department, where, he said, ‘It could make money for the store.’ It’s like\ndrowning and having a crowd of spectators just standing there waiting for me to sink away.”\nThe executive talked on, elaborating further on his predicament. \nFinally I cut in and asked, “What\nare you doing about it? What are you trying to do to correct the situation?”\n“Well,” he answered, “there isn’t much I can do, I guess, but hope for the best.”\nTo this comment I asked, “Honestly, now, is hope enough?” Pausing, but not giving him a chance\nto answer, I put another question to him: “Why not take action to support your hope?”\n“Go on,” he said.\n“Well, there are two kinds of action that seem to fit your case. First, start this afternoon to move\nthose sales figures upward. We’ve got to face it. There’s a reason your sales are slipping. Find it.\nMaybe you need a special sale to clear out your slow-moving merchandise, so you’ll be in a position\nto buy some fresh stock. Perhaps you can rearrange your display counters. Maybe your salespeople\nneed more enthusiasm. I can’t pinpoint what will turn your sales volume upward, but something will.\nAnd it would probably be wise to talk privately with your merchandise manager. He may be on the\nverge of putting you out, but when you talk it over with him and ask his advice, he’ll certainly give\nyou more time to work things out. It’s too expensive for the store to replace you as long as top\nmanagement feels there’s a chance you’ll find a solution.”\nI went on, “Then get your assistant buyers on the ball. Quit acting like a drowning man. Let people\naround you know that you’re still alive.”\nCourage was again in his eyes. Then he asked, “You said there are two kinds of action I should\ntake. What’s the second?”\n“The second type of action, which you might say is an insurance policy, is to let two or three of\nyour closest business friends in the trade know you might consider an offer from \nanother store,\nassuming, of course, it is substantially better than your present job.\n“I don’t believe your job will be insecure after you take some affirmative action to get those sales\nfigures on the rise. But just in case, it’s good to have an offer or two. Remember, it’s ten times easier\nfor a man with a job to get another job than it is for someone unemployed to connect.”\n\f\nTwo days ago this once-troubled executive called me.\n“After our talk I buckled down. I made a number of changes, but the most basic one was with my\nsalespeople. I used to hold sales meetings once a week, but now I’m holding one every morning. I’ve\ngot those people really enthusiastic. I guess once they saw some life in me they were ready to push\nharder too. They were just waiting for me to start things moving again.\n“Things sure are working out okay. Last week my sales were well ahead of a year ago and much\nbetter than the store’s average.\n“Oh, by the way,” he continued, “I want to tell you some other good news. I got two job offers\nsince we talked. Naturally I’m glad, but I’ve turned them both down since everything is looking good\nhere again.”\nWhen we face tough problems, we stay mired in the mud until we take action. Hope is a start. But\nhope needs action to win victories.\nPut the action principle to work. Next time you experience big fear or little fear, steady yourself.\nThen search for an answer to this question: What kind of action can I take to conquer my fear?\nIsolate your fear. Then take appropriate action.\nBelow are some examples of fear and some possible action cures.\nTYPE OF FEAR\nACTION\n1. Embarrassment because of personal\nappearance.\nImprove it. Go to a barbershop or beauty salon.\nShine your shoes. Get your clothes cleaned and\npressed. In general, practice better grooming. It\ndoesn’t always take \nnew\n clothes.\n2. Fear of losing an important customer.\nWork doubly hard to give better service. Correct\nanything that may have caused customers to lose\nconfidence in you.\n3. Fear of failing an examination.\nConvert worry time into study time.\n4. Fear of things totally beyond your control.\nTurn your attention to helping to relieve the fear\nof others. Pray.\n5. Fear of being physically hurt by something you\ncan’t control, such as a tornado or an airplane out\nof control.\nSwitch your attention to something totally\ndifferent. Go out into your yard and pull up\nweeds. Play with your children. Go to a movie.\n6. Fear of what other people may think and say.\nMake sure that what you plan to do is right. Then\ndo it. No one ever does anything worthwhile for\nwhich he is not criticized.\n7. Fear of making an investment or purchasing a\nhome.\nAnalyze all factors. Then be decisive. Make a\ndecision and stick with it. Trust your own\njudgment.\n8. Fear of people.\nPut them in proper perspective. Remember, the\nother person is just another human being pretty\nmuch like yourself.\n\f\nUse this two-step procedure to cure fear and win confidence:\n1. Isolate your fear. Pin it down. Determine exactly what you are afraid of.\n2. Then take action. There is some kind of action for any kind of fear.\nAnd remember, hesitation only enlarges, magnifies the fear. Take action promptly. Be decisive.\n*\nMuch lack of self-confidence can be traced directly to a mismanaged memory.\nYour brain is very much like a bank. Every day you make thought deposits in your “mind bank.”\nThese thought deposits grow and become your memory. When you settle down to think or when you\nface a problem, in effect you say to your memory bank, “What do I already know about this?”\nYour memory bank automatically answers and supplies you with bits of information relating to\nthis situation that you deposited on previous occasions. Your memory, then, is the basic supplier of\nraw material for your new thought.\nThe teller in your memory bank is tremendously reliable. He never crosses you up. If you\napproach him and say, “Mr. Teller, let me withdraw some thoughts I deposited in the past proving I’m\ninferior to just about everybody else,” he’ll say, “Certainly, sir. Recall how you failed two times\npreviously when you tried this? Recall what your sixth-grade teacher told you about your inability to\naccomplish things . . . Recall what you overheard some fellow workers saying about\nyou . . . Recall . . .”\nAnd on and on Mr. Teller goes, digging out of your brain thought after thought that proves you are\ninadequate.\nBut suppose you visit your memory teller with this request: “Mr. Teller, I face a difficult decision.\nCan you supply me with any thoughts which will give me reassurance?”\nAnd again Mr. Teller says, “Certainly, sir,” but this time he delivers thoughts you deposited\nearlier that say you can succeed. “Recall the excellent job you did in a similar situation before. . . .\nRecall how much confidence Mr. Smith placed in you. . . . Recall what your good friends said about\nyou. . . . Recall . . .”\nMr. Teller, perfectly responsive, lets you withdraw the thought deposits you want to withdraw.\nAfter all, it is your bank.\nHere are two specific things to do to build confidence through efficient management of your\nmemory bank.\n1. Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank.\n Let’s face it squarely: everyone encounters\nplenty of unpleasant, embarrassing, and discouraging situations. But unsuccessful and successful\npeople deal with these situations in directly opposite ways. Unsuccessful people take them to heart,\nso to speak. They dwell on the unpleasant situations, thereby giving them a good start in their memory.\nThey don’t take their minds away from them. At night the unpleasant situation is the last thing they\nthink about.\nConfident, successful people, on the other hand, “don’t give it another thought.” Successful people\nspecialize in putting positive thoughts into their memory bank.\nWhat kind of performance would your car deliver if every morning before you left for work you\n\f\nscooped up a double handful \nof dirt and put it into your crankcase? That fine engine would soon be a\nmess, unable to do what you want it to do. Negative, unpleasant thoughts deposited in your mind\naffect your mind the same way. Negative thoughts produce needless wear and tear on your mental\nmotor. They create worry, frustration, and feelings of inferiority. They put you beside the road while\nothers drive ahead.\nDo this: in these moments when you’re alone with your thoughts—when you’re driving your car\nor eating alone—recall pleasant, positive experiences. Put good thoughts in your memory bank. This\nboosts confidence. It gives you that “I-sure-feel-good” feeling. It helps keep your body functioning\nright, too.\nHere is an excellent plan. Just before you go to sleep, deposit good thoughts in your memory bank.\nCount your blessings. Recall the many good things you have to be thankful for: your wife or husband,\nyour children, your friends, your health. Recall the good things you saw people do today. Recall your\nlittle victories and accomplishments. Go over the reasons why you are glad to be alive.\n2. Withdraw only positive thoughts from your memory bank.\n I was closely associated several years\nago in Chicago with a firm of psychological consultants. They handled many types of cases, but\nmostly marriage problems and psychological adjustment situations, all dealing with mind matters.\nOne afternoon as I was talking with the head of the firm about his profession and his techniques\nfor helping the seriously maladjusted person, he made this remark: “You know, there would be no\nneed for my services if people would do just one thing.”\n“What’s that?” I asked eagerly.\n“Simply this: destroy their negative thoughts before those thoughts become mental monsters.”\n“Most individuals I try to help,” he continued, “are operating their own private museum of mental\nhorror. Many marriage difficulties, for example, involve the ‘honeymoon monster.’ The honeymoon\nwasn’t as satisfactory as one or both of the marriage partners had hoped, but instead of burying the\nmemory, they reflected on it hundreds of times until it was a giant obstacle to successful marital\nrelationships. They come to me as much as five or ten years later.\n“Usually, of course, my clients don’t see where their trouble lies. It’s my job to uncover and\nexplain the source of their difficulty to them and help them to see what a triviality it really is.\n“A person can make a mental monster out of almost any unpleasant happening,” my psychologist\nfriend went on. “A job failure, a jilted romance, a bad investment, disappointment in the behavior of a\nteenage child—these are common monsters I have to help troubled people destroy.”\nIt is clear that any negative thought, if fertilized with repeated recall, can develop into a real mind\nmonster, breaking down confidence and paving the way to serious psychological difficulties.\nIn an article in \nCosmopolitan\n magazine, “The Drive Toward Self-Destruction,” Alice Mulcahey\npointed out that upward of 30,000 Americans commit suicide each year and another 100,000 attempt\nto take their own lives. She went on to say, “There is shocking evidence that millions of other people\nare killing themselves by slower, less obvious methods. Still others are committing spiritual rather\nthan physical suicide, constantly \nseeking out ways to humiliate, punish, and generally diminish\nthemselves.”\nThe psychologist friend mentioned before told me how he helped one of his patients to stop\ncommitting “mental and spiritual suicide.” “This patient,” he explained, “was in her late thirties and\nhad two children. In lay terminology she suffered from severe depression. She looked back on every\nincident of her life as being an unhappy experience. Her school days, her marriage, the bearing of her\nchildren, the places she had lived all were thought of negatively. She volunteered that she couldn’t"

    "raw_text": "remember ever having been truly happy. And since what one remembers from the past colors what\none sees in the present, she saw nothing but pessimism and darkness.\n“When I asked her what she saw in a picture which I showed her, she said, ‘It looks like there\nwill be a terrible thunderstorm tonight.’ That was the gloomiest interpretation of the picture I’ve yet\nheard.” (The picture was a large oil painting of the sun low in the sky and a jagged, rocky coastline.\nThe painting was very cleverly done and could be construed to be either a sunrise or a sunset. The\npsychologist commented to me that what a person sees in the picture is a clue to his personality. Most\npeople say it is a sunrise. But the depressed, mentally disturbed person nearly always says it’s a\nsunset.)\n“As a psychologist, I can’t change what already is in a person’s memory. But I can, with the\npatient’s cooperation, help the individual to see his past in a different light. That’s the general\ntreatment I used on this woman. I worked with her to help her to see joy and pleasure in her past\ninstead of total disappointment. After six months she began to show improvement. At that point, I gave\nher a special assignment. Each day I asked her to think of \nand write down three specific reasons she\nhas to be happy. Then at her next appointment with me on Thursdays I’d go over her list with her. I\ncontinued this sort of treatment for three months. Her improvement was very satisfactory. Today that\nwoman is very well adjusted to her situation. She’s positive and certainly as happy as most people.”\nWhen this woman quit drawing negatives from her memory bank, she was headed toward\nrecovery.\nWhether the psychological problem is big or little, the cure comes when one learns to quit\ndrawing negatives from one’s memory bank and withdraws positives instead.\nDon’t build mental monsters. Refuse to withdraw the unpleasant thoughts from your memory bank.\nWhen you remember situations of any kind, concentrate on the good part of the experience; forget the\nbad. Bury it. If you find yourself thinking about the negative side, turn your mind off completely.\nAnd here is something very significant and very encouraging. Your mind wants you to forget the\nunpleasant. If you will just cooperate, unpleasant memories will gradually shrivel and the teller in\nyour memory bank will cancel them out.\nDr. Melvin S. Hattwick, noted advertising psychologist, in commenting on our ability to\nremember, says, “When the feeling aroused is pleasant, the advertisement has a better chance to be\nremembered. When the feeling aroused is unpleasant, the reader or listener tends to forget the\nadvertisement message. The unpleasant runs counter to what we want, we don’t want to remember it.”\nIn brief, it really is easy to forget the unpleasant if we simply refuse to recall it. Withdraw only\npositive thoughts from your \nmemory bank. Let the others fade away. And your confidence, that feeling\nof being on top of the world, will zoom upward. You take a big step forward toward conquering fear\nwhen you refuse to remember negative, self-deprecating thoughts.\nWhy do people fear other people? Why do many folks feel self-conscious around others? What’s\nbehind shyness? What can we do about it?\nFear of other people is a big fear. But there is a way to conquer it. You can conquer fear of people\nif you will learn to put them into proper perspective.\nA business friend, who is doing exceptionally well operating his own wood-novelty plant,\nexplained to me how he got the proper perspective of people. His example is interesting.\n“Before I went into the army in World War II, I was scared of just about everybody. You just\nwouldn’t believe how shy and timid I was. I felt everyone else was a lot smarter. I worried about my\nphysical and mental inadequacies. I thought I was born to fail.\n“Then by some fortunate quirk of fate I lost my fear of people in the Army. During part of 1942\n\f\nand 1943, when the Army was inducting men at a terrific clip, I was stationed as a medic at one of the\nbig induction centers. Day after day I assisted in examining those men. The more I looked at these\nrecruits, the less afraid of people I became.\n“All those men lined up by the hundreds, naked as jaybirds, looked so much alike. Oh sure, there\nwere fat ones and skinny ones, tall ones and short ones, but they all were confused, all were\nlonesome. Just a few days before some of these were rising young executives. Some were farmers,\nsome were salesmen, drifters, blue-collar workers. A few days before they had been many things. But\nat the induction center they were all alike.\n“I figured out something pretty basic back then. I discovered people are alike in many, many more\nways than they are different. I discovered the other fellow is pretty much like me. He likes good food,\nhe misses his family and friends, he wants to get ahead, he has problems, he likes to relax. So if the\nother fellow is basically like me, there’s no point in being afraid of him.”\nNow, doesn’t that make sense? If the other fellow is basically like me, there’s no reason to be\nafraid of him.\nHere are two ways to put people in proper perspective:\n1. Get a balanced view of the other fellow.\n Keep these two points in mind when dealing with people:\nfirst, the other fellow is important. Emphatically, he is important. Every human being is. But\nremember this, also: \nYou are important, too.\n So when you meet another person, make it a policy to\nthink, “We’re just two important people sitting down to discuss something of mutual interest and\nbenefit.”\nA couple of months ago, a business executive phoned to tell me he had just employed a young man\nwhom I had recommended to him shortly before. “Do you know what really sold me on that fellow?”\nasked my friend. “What?” I asked. “Well, it was the way he handled himself. Most job applicants\nwhen they walk in here are half scared. They give me all the answers they think I want to hear. In a\nway, most job applicants are a little like beggars—they’ll accept anything, and they aren’t particular.\n“But G. handled himself differently. He respected me, but what’s just as important, he respects\nhimself. What’s more, he asked me as many questions as I asked him. He’s no mouse. He’s a real man,\nand he’s going to do all right.”\nThis mutually important attitude helps you keep the situation balanced. The other fellow does not\nbecome too important relative to you in your thinking.\nThe other fellow might look frightfully big, frightfully important. But remember, he is still a human\nbeing with essentially the same interests, desires, and problems as you.\n2. Develop an understanding attitude.\n People who want figuratively to bite you, growl at you, pick\non you, and otherwise chop you down are not rare. If you’re not prepared for people like that, they\ncan punch big holes in your confidence and make you feel completely defeated. You need a defense\nagainst the adult bully, the fellow who likes to throw his meager weight around.\nA few months ago, at the reservations desk of a Memphis hotel, I saw an excellent demonstration\nof the right way to handle folks like this.\nIt was shortly after 5 \nP.M.\n, and the hotel was busy registering new guests. The fellow ahead of me\ngave his name to the clerk in a commanding way. The clerk said, “Yes sir, Mr. R., we have a fine\nsingle for you.”\n“Single?” shouted the fellow. “I ordered a double.”\nThe clerk said, very politely, “Let me check, sir.” He pulled the guest’s reservation from the file\n\f\nand said, “I’m sorry, sir. Your telegram specified a single. I’d be happy to put you in a double room,\nsir, if we had any available. But we simply do not.”\nThen the irate customer said, “I don’t care what the h— that piece of paper says, I want a\ndouble.”\nThen he started in with that “do-you-know-who-I-am?” bit, followed with “I’ll have you fired.\nYou’ll see, I’ll have you fired.”\nAs best he could, under the verbal tornado, the young clerk injected, “Sir, we’re terribly sorry, but\nwe acted on your instructions.”\nFinally the customer, really furious now, said, “I wouldn’t stay in the best suite in this — — hotel\nnow that I know how badly managed it is,” and stormed out.\nI stepped up to the desk, thinking the clerk, who had taken one of the worst public tongue-lashings\nI’d seen in some time, would be upset. Instead he greeted me with one of the finest “Good evening,\nsir”s I’d ever heard. As he went through the routine of processing my room, I said to him, “I certainly\nadmire the way you handled yourself just a moment ago. You have tremendous temper control.”\n“Well, sir,” he said, “I really can’t get mad at a fellow like that. You see, he really isn’t mad at\nme. I was just the scapegoat. The poor fellow may be in bad trouble with his wife, or his business\nmay be off, or maybe he feels inferior and this was his golden chance to feel like a wheel. I’m just the\nguy who gave him a chance to get something out of his system.”\nThe clerk added, “Underneath he’s probably a very nice guy. Most folks are.”\nWalking toward the elevators, I caught myself repeating aloud, “Underneath he’s probably a very\nnice guy. Most folks are.”\nRemember those two short sentences next time someone declares war on you. Hold your fire. The\nway to win in situations like this is to let the other fellow blow his stack and then forget it.\n*\nSeveral years ago, while checking student examination papers, I came across one that especially\ndisturbed me. The student who \nwrote the examination had demonstrated in class discussions and\nprevious tests that he was far better qualified than his paper indicated. He was, in fact, the fellow\nwho I thought would finish at the top of the class. Instead his paper put him at the bottom. As was my\ncustom in such cases, I had my secretary call the student and ask him to come by my office on an\nurgent matter.\nPaul W. appeared shortly. He looked as though he had been through a terrible experience. After he\nwas comfortably seated, I said to him, “What happened, Paul? This just isn’t the quality paper I\nexpected you to write.”\nPaul struggled with himself, looked in the direction of his feet and replied, “Sir, after I saw that\nyou had spotted me cheating, I just went to pieces. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. Honest, this is\nthe first time I’ve ever cheated at the university. I desperately wanted an A, so I worked up a little\npony to use.”\nHe was terribly upset. But now that he was talking, he wouldn’t stop. “I suppose you’ll have to\nrecommend me for dismissal. The university rule says any student found cheating in any manner is\nsubject to permanent dismissal.”\nHere Paul started bringing up the shame this incident would bring to his family, how it would\nwreck his life, and all sorts of repercussions. Finally I said, “Hold it, now. Slow down. Let me\nexplain something. I didn’t see you cheat. Until you walked in and told me, I hadn’t the faintest idea\n\f\nthat was the trouble. I am sorry, Paul, that you did.”\nThen I continued, “Paul, tell me, just what do you want to gain from your university experience?”\nHe was a little calmer now, and after a short pause he said, “Well, Doctor, I think my overall aim\nis to learn how to live, but I guess I’m failing pretty badly.”\n“We learn in different ways,” I said. “I think you can learn a real success lesson from this\nexperience.\n“When you used your pony in there, your conscience bothered you terribly. This gave you a guilt\ncomplex that in turn broke your confidence. As you expressed it, you went to pieces.\n“Most of the time, Paul, this matter of right and wrong is approached from a moral or religious\nstandpoint. Now, understand, I’m not here to preach to you, give you a sermon about right and wrong.\nBut let’s look at the practical side. When you do anything that goes contrary to your conscience, you\nfeel guilty, and this guilty feeling jams your thought processes. You can’t think straight because your\nmind is asking ‘Will I get caught? Will I get caught?’\n“Paul,” I continued, “you wanted an A so badly you did something you knew was wrong. There\nare many times in life when you’ll want to make an A so badly you’ll be tempted to do something that\nis contrary to your conscience. For example, someday you may want to make a sale so badly you’ll\nthink of deliberately misleading the customer to buy. And you may succeed. But here’s what will\nhappen. Your guilty feeling will grab hold of you and the next time you see your customer, you’ll be\nself-conscious, ill at ease. You’ll be wondering ‘Has he discovered that I put something over?’ Your\npresentation will be ineffective because you can’t concentrate. Chances are you’ll never make the\nsecond, third, fourth, and the many repeat sales. In the long run, making that sale using tactics that hurt\nyour conscience will cost you a lot of income.”\nI went on and pointed out to Paul how an occasional business or professional man loses his grip\nbecause of an intense fear that his wife will learn about a secret love affair he is having with another\nwoman. “Will she find out? Will she find out?” eats away the man’s confidence until he can’t do a\ngood job at work or in the home.\nI reminded Paul that many criminals are captured not because any clues point to them but because\nthey act guilty and self-conscious. Their guilt feeling puts them on the suspect list.\nThere is within each of us a desire to be right, think right, and act right. When we go against that\ndesire, we put a cancer in our conscience. This cancer grows and grows by eating away at our\nconfidence. Avoid doing anything that will cause you to ask yourself, “Will I get caught? Will they\nfind out? Will I get away with it?”\nDon’t try to make an A if it means violating your confidence.\nPaul, I’m pleased to say, got the point. He learned the practical value of doing what’s right. I then\nproposed he sit down and retake the examination. In answer to his question “But what about my\ndismissal?” I said, “I know what the regulations say about cheating. But, you know, if we dismissed\nall students who have cheated in any way, half the professors would have to leave. And if we\ndismissed all students who thought about cheating, the university would have to shut down.\n“So I’m forgetting this whole incident if you’ll do me a favor.”\n“Gladly,” he said.\nI walked over to my bookshelf, took down my personal copy of \nFifty Years with the Golden Rule\n,\nand said, “Paul, read this book and return it. See how, in J. C. Penney’s own words, just doing what’s\nright made him one of America’s richest men.”\nDoing what’s right keeps your conscience satisfied. And this builds self-confidence. When we do\nwhat is known to be wrong, \ntwo negative things happen. First, we feel guilt and this guilt eats away\n\f\nconfidence. Second, other people sooner or later find out and lose confidence in us.\nDo what’s right and keep your confidence. That’s \nthinking yourself to success.\nHere is a psychological principle that is worth reading over twenty-five times. Read it until it\nabsolutely saturates you: \nTo think confidently, act confidently.\nThe great psychologist Dr. George W. Crane said in his famous book \nApplied Psychology\n,\n“Remember, motions are the precursors of emotions. You can’t control the latter directly but only\nthrough your choice of motions or actions. . . . To avoid this all too common tragedy (marital\ndifficulties and misunderstandings) become aware of the true psychological facts. Go through the\nproper motions each day and you’ll soon begin to feel the corresponding emotions! Just be sure you\nand your mate go through those motions of dates and kisses, the phrasing of sincere daily\ncompliments, plus the many other little courtesies, and you need not worry about the emotion of love.\nYou can’t act devoted for very long without feeling devoted.”\nPsychologists tell us we can change our attitudes by changing our physical actions. For example,\nyou actually feel more like smiling if you make yourself smile. You feel more superior when you\nmake yourself stand tall than when you slouch. On the negative side, frown a really bitter frown and\nsee if you don’t feel more like frowning.\nIt is easy to prove that managed motions can change emotions. People who are shy in introducing\nthemselves can replace this timidity with confidence just by taking three simple actions\nsimultaneously: First, reach for the other person’s hand and clasp it warmly. Second, look directly at\nthe other person. And third, say, “I’m very glad to know you.”\nThese three simple actions automatically and instantaneously banish shyness. Confident action\nproduces confident thinking.\nSo, to think confidently, act confidently. Act the way you want to feel. Below are five confidence-\nbuilding exercises. Read these guides carefully. Then make a conscious effort to practice them and\nbuild your confidence.\n1. Be a front seater.\n Ever notice in meetings—in church, classrooms, and other kinds of assemblies—\nhow the back seats fill up first? Most folks scramble to sit in the back rows so they won’t be “too\nconspicuous.” And the reason they are afraid to be conspicuous is that they lack confidence.\nSitting up front builds confidence. Practice it. From now on make it a rule to sit as close to the\nfront as you can. Sure, you may be a little more conspicuous in the front, but remember, there is\nnothing inconspicuous about success.\n2. Practice making eye contact.\n How a person uses his eyes tells us a lot about him. Instinctively,\nyou ask yourself questions about the fellow who doesn’t look you in the eye. “What’s he trying to\nhide? What’s he afraid of? Is he trying to put something over on me? Is he holding something back?”\nUsually, failure to make eye contact says one of two things. It may say, “I feel weak beside you. I\nfeel inferior to you. I’m afraid of you.” Or avoiding another person’s eyes may say, “I feel \nguilty. I’ve\ndone something or I’ve thought something that I don’t want you to know. I’m afraid if I let my eyes\nconnect with yours, you’ll see through me.”\nYou say nothing good about yourself when you avoid making eye contact. You say, “I’m afraid. I\nlack confidence.” Conquer this fear by \nmaking\n yourself look the other person in the eyes.\nLooking the other person in the eye tells him, “I’m honest and aboveboard. I believe in what I’m\ntelling you. I’m not afraid. I’m confident.”\nMake your eyes work for you. Aim them right at the other person’s eyes. It not only \ngives\n you\n\f\nconfidence, it \nwins\n you confidence, too.\n3. Walk 25 percent faster.\n When I was a youngster, just going to the county seat was a big treat. After\nall the errands were accomplished and we were back in the car, my mother would often say, “Davey,\nlet’s just sit here a while and watch the people walk by.”\nMother was an excellent game player. She’d say, “See that fellow. What do you suppose is\ntroubling him?” Or “What do you think that lady there is going to do?” or “Look at that person. He just\nseems to be in a fog.”\nWatching people walk and move about became real fun. It was a lot cheaper than the movies\n(which was one of the reasons, I learned later, that Mother developed the game), and it was a lot\nmore instructive.\nI still am a walk watcher. In corridors, lobbies, on sidewalks I still occasionally find myself\nstudying human behavior simply by watching people move about.\nPsychologists link slovenly posture and sluggish walking to unpleasant attitudes towards oneself,\nwork, and the \npeople around us. But psychologists also tell us you can actually change your attitudes\nby changing your posture and speed of movement. Watch, and you discover that body action is the\nresult of mind action. The extremely beaten people, the real down-and-outers, just shuffle and stumble\nalong. They have zero self-confidence.\nAverage people have the “average” walk. Their pace is “average.” They have the look of “I really\ndon’t have very much pride in myself.”\nThen there’s a third group. Persons in this group show superconfidence. They walk faster than the\naverage. There seems to be a slight sprint in the way they walk. Their walk tells the world, “I’ve got\nsomeplace important to go, something important to do. What’s more, I will succeed at what I will do\nfifteen minutes from now.”\nUse the walk-25-percent-faster technique to help build self-confidence. Throw your shoulders\nback, lift up your head, move ahead just a little faster, and feel self-confidence grow.\nJust try and see.\n4. Practice speaking up.\n In working with many kinds of groups of all sizes, I’ve watched many\npersons with keen perception and much native ability freeze and fail to participate in discussions. It\nisn’t that these folks don’t want to get in and wade with the rest. Rather, it’s a simple lack of\nconfidence.\nThe conference clam thinks to himself, “My opinion is probably worthless. If I say something, I’ll\nprobably look foolish. I’ll just say nothing. Besides, the others in the group probably know more than\nI. I don’t want the others to know how ignorant I am.”\nEach time the conference clam fails to speak, he feels even more \ninadequate, more inferior. Often\nhe makes a faint promise to himself (that down deep he knows he won’t keep) to speak “next time.”\nThis is very important: each time our clam fails to speak, he takes one more dose of confidence\npoison. He becomes less and less confident of himself.\nBut on the positive side, the more you speak up, the more you add to your confidence, and the\neasier it is to speak up the next time. Speak up. It’s a confidence-building vitamin.\nPut this confidence builder to use. Make it a rule to speak up at every open meeting you attend.\nSpeak up, say something \nvoluntarily\n at \nevery\n business conference, committee meeting, community\nforum you attend. Make no exception. Comment, make a suggestion, ask a question. And don’t be the\nlast to speak. Try to be the icebreaker, the first one in with a comment.\n\f\nAnd never worry about looking foolish. You won’t. For each person who doesn’t agree with you,\nodds are another person will. Quit asking yourself, “I wonder if I dare speak?”\nInstead, concentrate on getting the discussion leader’s attention so you \ncan\n speak.\nFor special training and experience in speaking, consider joining your local toastmaster’s club.\nThousands of conscientious people have developed confidence through a planned program to feel at\nease talking \nwith\n people and \nto\n people.\n5. Smile big.\n Most folks have heard at one time or another that a smile will give them a real boost.\nThey’ve been told that a smile is excellent medicine for confidence deficiency. But lots of people still\ndon’t really believe this because they’ve never tried smiling when they feel fear.\nMake this little test. Try to feel defeated and smile big at the same time. You can’t. A big smile\ngives you confidence. A big smile beats fear, rolls away worry, defeats despondency.\nAnd a real smile does more than cure just your ill feeling. A real smile melts away the opposition\nof others—and instantly, too. Another person simply can’t be angry with you if you give him a big,\nsincere smile. Just the other day, a little incident happened to me that illustrates this. I was parked at\nan intersection waiting for the light to change when BAM! The driver behind me had let his foot slip\nthe brake and put my rear bumper to a test. I looked back through my mirror and saw him getting out. I\ngot out, too, and, forgetting the rule book, started preparing myself for verbal combat. I confess I was\nready verbally to bite him to pieces.\nBut fortunately, before I got the chance, he walked up to me, smiled, and said in the most earnest\nvoice, “Friend, I really didn’t mean to do that.” That smile, matched with his sincere comment, melted\nme. I mumbled something about “That’s O.K. Happens all the time.” Almost in less time than it takes\nto wink an eye, my opposition turned into friendship.\nSmile big and you feel like “happy days are here again.” But smile \nbig.\n A half-developed smile is\nnot fully guaranteed. Smile until your teeth show. That large-size smile is fully guaranteed.\nI’ve heard many times, “Yes, but when I fear something, or when I’m angry, I don’t feel like\nsmiling.”\nOf course you don’t. No one does. The trick is to tell yourself forcefully, “I’m going to smile.”\nThen smile.\nHarness the power of smiling.\n\f\nPUT THESE FIVE PROCEDURES TO WORK FOR YOU\n1. Action cures fear. Isolate your fear and then take constructive action. Inaction—doing nothing about\na situation—strengthens fear and destroys confidence.\n2. Make a supreme effort to put only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Don’t let negative, self-\ndeprecatory thoughts grow into mental monsters. Simply refuse to recall unpleasant events or\nsituations.\n3. Put people in proper perspective. Remember, people are more alike, much more alike, than they\nare different. Get a balanced view of the other fellow. He is just another human being. And develop\nan understanding attitude. Many people will bark, but it’s a rare one who bites.\n4. Practice doing what your conscience tells you is right. This prevents a poisonous guilt complex\nfrom developing. Doing what’s right is a very practical rule for success.\n5. Make everything about you say, “I’m confident, really confident.” Practice these little techniques in\nyour day-to-day activities:\nBe a front seater.\nMake eye contact.\nWalk 25 percent faster.\nSpeak up.\nSmile big.\n\f\n4"

    "raw_text": "HOW TO THINK BIG\nRecently I chatted with a recruitment specialist for one of the nation’s largest industrial organizations.\nFour months each year she visits college campuses to recruit graduating seniors for her company’s\njunior executive training program. The tenor of her remarks indicated that she was discouraged about\nthe attitudes of many people she talked with.\n“Most days I interview between eight and twelve college seniors, all in the upper third of their\nclass, all at least mildly interested in coming with us. One of the main things we want to determine in\nthe screening interview is the individual’s motivation. We want to find out if he or she is the kind of\nperson who can, in a few years, direct major projects, manage a branch office or plant, or in some\nother way make a really substantial contribution to the company.\n“I must say I’m not too pleased with the personal objectives of most of those I talk with. You’d be\nsurprised,” she went on, “how many twenty-two-year-olds are more interested in our retirement plan\nthan in anything else we have to offer. A second favorite question is ‘Will I move around a lot?’ Most\nof them \nseem to define the word \nsuccess\n as synonymous with \nsecurity.\n Can we risk turning our\ncompany over to people like that?\n“The thing I can’t understand is why should young people these days be so ultraconservative, so\nnarrow in their view of the future? Every day there are more signs of expanding opportunity. This\ncountry is making record progress in scientific and industrial development. Our population is gaining\nrapidly. If there ever was a time to be bullish about America, it’s now.”\nThe tendency for so many people to think small means there is much less competition than you\nthink for a very rewarding career.\nWhere success is concerned, people are not measured in inches or pounds or college degrees, or\nfamily background; they are measured by the size of their thinking. How big we think determines the\nsize of our accomplishments. Now let’s see how we can enlarge our thinking.\nEver ask yourself, “What is my greatest weakness?” Probably the greatest human weakness is\nself-deprecation—that is, selling oneself short. Self-deprecation shows through in countless ways.\nJohn sees a job advertisement in the paper; it’s exactly what he would like. But he does nothing about\nit because he thinks, “I’m not good enough for that job, so why bother?” Or Jim wants a date with\nJoan, but he doesn’t call her because he thinks he wouldn’t rate with her.\nTom feels Mr. Richards would be a very good prospect for his product, but Tom doesn’t call. He\nfeels Mr. Richards is too big to see him. Pete is filling out a job application form. One question asks,\n“What beginning salary do you expect?” Pete puts down a modest figure because he feels he really\nisn’t worth the bigger sum that he would like to earn.\nPhilosophers for thousands of years have issued good \nadvice: \nKnow thyself.\n But most people, it\nseems, interpret this suggestion to mean \nKnow only thy negative self.\n Most self-evaluation consists of\nmaking long mental lists of one’s faults, shortcomings, inadequacies.\nIt’s well to know our inabilities, for this shows us areas in which we can improve. But if we\nknow only our negative characteristics, we’re in a mess. Our value is small."

    "raw_text": "Here is an exercise to help you measure your true size. I’ve used it in training programs for\nexecutives and sales personnel. It works.\n1. Determine your five chief assets. Invite some objective friend to help—possibly your wife, your\nsuperior, a professor—some intelligent person who will give you an honest opinion. (Examples of\nassets frequently listed are education, experience, technical skills, appearance, well-adjusted home\nlife, attitudes, personality, initiative.)\n2. Next, under each asset, write the names of three persons you know who have achieved large\nsuccess but who do \nnot\n have this asset to as great a degree as you.\nWhen you’ve completed this exercise, you will find you outrank many successful people on at\nleast one asset.\nThere is only one conclusion you can honestly reach: You’re bigger than you think. So fit your\nthinking to your true size. Think as big as you really are! Never, never, never sell yourself short!\n*\nThe person who says “adamantine” when in plain talk he means “immovable” or says “coquette”\nwhen we would understand \nhim better if he said “flirt” may have a big vocabulary. But does he have\na big thinker’s vocabulary? Probably not. People who use difficult, high-sounding words and phrases\nthat most folks have to strain themselves to understand are inclined to be overbearing and stuffed\nshirts. And stuffed shirts are usually small thinkers.\nThe important measure of a person’s vocabulary is not the size or the number of words he uses.\nRather, the thing that counts, the \nonly\n thing that counts about one’s vocabulary, is the effect his words\nand phrases have on his own and others’ thinking.\nHere is something very basic: \nWe do not think in words and phrases. We think only in pictures\nand/or images.\n Words are the raw materials of thought. When spoken or read, that amazing\ninstrument, the mind, automatically converts words and phrases into mind pictures. Each word, each\nphrase, creates a slightly different mind picture. If someone tells you, “Jim bought a new split-level,”\nyou see one picture. But if you’re told, “Jim bought a new ranch house,” you see another picture. The\nmind pictures we see are modified by the kinds of words we use to name things and describe things.\nLook at it this way. When you speak or write, you are, in a sense, a projector showing movies in\nthe minds of others. And the pictures you create determine how you and others react.\nSuppose you tell a group of people, “I’m sorry to report we’ve failed.” What do these people\nsee? They see defeat and all the disappointment and grief the word “failed” conveys. Now suppose\nyou said instead, “Here’s a new approach that I think will work.” They would feel encouraged, ready\nto try again.\nSuppose you say, “We face a problem.” You have created a picture in the minds of others of\nsomething difficult, unpleasant \nto solve. Instead say, “We face a challenge,” and you create a mind\npicture of fun, sport, something pleasant to do.\nOr tell a group, “We incurred a big expense,” and people see money spent that will never return.\nIndeed, this is unpleasant. Instead say, “We made a big investment,” and people see a picture of\nsomething that will return profits later on, a very pleasant sight.\nThe point is this: Big thinkers are specialists in creating positive, forward-looking, optimistic\n\f\npictures in their own minds and in the minds of others. \nTo think big, we must use words and phrases\nthat produce big, positive mental images.\nIn the left-hand column below are examples of phrases that create small, negative, depressing\nthoughts. In the right-hand column the same situation is discussed but in a big, positive way.\nAs you read these, ask yourself: “What mind pictures do I see?”\nPHRASES THAT CREATE SMALL,\nNEGATIVE MIND IMAGES\nPHRASES THAT CREATE BIG, POSITIVE\nMIND IMAGES\n1. It’s no use, we’re whipped.\nWe’re not whipped yet. Let’s keep trying. Here’s\na new angle.\n2. I was in that business once and failed. Never\nagain.\nI went broke but it was my own fault. I’m going\nto try again.\n3. I’ve tried but the product won’t sell. People\ndon’t want it.\nSo far I’ve not been able to sell this product. But\nI know it is good and I’m going to find the\nformula that will put it over.\n4. The market is saturated. Imagine, 75 percent of\nthe potential has already been sold. Better get\nout.\nImagine, 25 percent of the market is still not sold.\nCount me in. This looks big!\n5. Their orders have been small. Cut them off.\nTheir orders have been small. Let’s map out a\nplan for selling them more of their needs.\n6. Five years is too long a time to spend before\nI’ll get into the top ranks in your company. Count\nme out.\nFive years is not really a long time. Just think,\nthat leaves me thirty years to serve at a high\nlevel.\n7. The competition has all the advantage. How do\nyou expect me to sell against them?\nCompetition is strong. There’s no denying that,\nbut no one ever has \nall\n the advantages. Let’s put\nour heads together and figure out a way to beat\nthem at their own game.\n8. Nobody will ever want that product.\nIn its present form, it may not be salable, but let’s\nconsider some modifications.\n9. Let’s wait until a recession comes along, then\nbuy stocks.\nLet’s invest now. Bet on prosperity, not\ndepression.\n10. I’m too young (old) for the job.\nBeing young (old) is a distinct advantage.\n11. It won’t work, let me prove it. The image:\ndark, gloom, disappointment, grief, failure.\nIt will work, let me prove it. The image: bright,\nhope, success, fun, victory."

    "raw_text": "FOUR WAYS TO DEVELOP THE BIG THINKER’S VOCABULARY\nHere are four ways to help you develop a big thinker’s vocabulary.\n1. Use big, positive, cheerful words and phrases to describe how you feel. When someone asks,\n“How do you feel today?” and you respond with an “I’m tired (I have a headache, I wish it were\nSaturday, I don’t feel so good),” you actually make yourself feel worse. Practice this: it’s a very\nsimple point, but it has tremendous power. Every time someone asks you, “How are you?” or\n“How are you feeling today?” respond with a “Just \nwonderful\n! thanks, and \nyou\n?” or say “Great” or\n“Fine.” Say you feel wonderful at every possible opportunity, and you will begin to feel wonderful\n—and bigger, too. Become known as a person who always feels great. It wins friends.\n2. Use bright, cheerful, favorable words and phrases to describe other people. Make it a rule to have\na big, positive word for all your friends and associates. When you and someone else are discussing\nan absent third party, be sure you compliment him with big words and phrases like “He’s really a\nfine\n fellow.” “They tell me he’s working out \nwonderfully\n well.” Be extremely careful to avoid the\npetty cut-him-down language. Sooner or later third parties hear what’s been said, and then such talk\nonly cuts \nyou\n down.\n3. Use positive language to encourage others. Compliment people personally at every opportunity.\nEveryone you know \ncraves praise. Have a special good word for your wife or husband every day.\nNotice and compliment the people who work with you. Praise, sincerely administered, is a success\ntool. Use it! Use it again and again and again. Compliment people on their appearance, their work,\ntheir achievements, their families.\n4. Use positive words to outline plans to others. When people hear something like this: “Here is some\ngood\n news. We face a genuine opportunity . . .” their minds start to sparkle. But when they hear\nsomething like “Whether we like it or not, we’ve got a job to do,” the mind movie is dull and\nboring, and they react accordingly. Promise victory and watch eyes light up. Promise victory and\nwin support. Build castles, don’t dig graves!\n\f\nSEE WHAT CAN BE, NOT JUST WHAT IS\nBig thinkers train themselves to see not just what is but what can be. Here are four examples to\nillustrate this point.\n1. What gives real estate value?\n A highly successful Realtor who specializes in rural property shows\nwhat can be done if we train ourselves to see something where little or nothing presently exists.\n“Most of the rural property around here,” my friend began, “is run-down and not very attractive.\nI’m successful because I don’t try to sell my prospects a farm as it \nis.\n“I develop my entire sales plan around what the farm \ncan\n be. Simply telling the prospect, ‘The\nfarm has XX acres of bottom land and XX acres of woods and is XX miles from town,’ \ndoesn’t stir\nhim up and make him want to buy it. But when you show him a concrete plan for doing something with\nthe farm, he’s just about sold. Here, let me show you what I mean.”\nHe opened his briefcase and pulled out a file. “This farm,” he said, “is a new listing with us. It’s\nlike a lot of them. It’s forty-three miles from the center of the metropolitan area, the house is run-\ndown, and the place hasn’t been farmed in five years. Now, here’s what I’ve done. I spent two full\ndays on the place last week, just studying it. I walked over the place several times. I looked at\nneighboring farms. I studied the location of the farm with respect to existing and planned highways. I\nasked myself, ‘What’s this farm good for?’\n“I came up with three possibilities. Here they are.” He showed them to me. Each plan was neatly\ntyped and looked quite comprehensive. One plan suggested converting the farm into a riding stable.\nThe plan showed why the idea was sound: a growing city, more love for the outdoors, more money\nfor recreation, good roads. The plan also showed how the farm could support a sizable number of\nhorses so that the revenue from the rides would be largely clear. The whole riding stable idea was\nvery thorough, very convincing. The plan was so clear and convincing, I could “see” a dozen couples\nriding horseback through the trees.\nIn similar fashion this enterprising salesman developed a second thorough plan for a tree farm and\na third plan for a combination tree and poultry farm.\n“Now when I talk with my prospects, I won’t have to convince them that the farm is a good buy as\nit is. I help them to see a picture of the farm changed into a moneymaking proposition.\n“Besides selling more farms and selling them faster, my \nmethod of selling the property for what it\ncan be pays off in another way: I can sell a farm at a higher price than my competitors. People\nnaturally pay more for acreage \nand\n an idea than they do for just acreage. Because of this, more people\nwant to list their farms with me and my commission on each sale is larger.”\nThe moral is this: \nLook at things not as they are, but as they can be. Visualization adds value to\neverything. A big thinker always visualizes what can be done in the future. He isn’t stuck with the\npresent.\n2. How much is a customer worth?\n A department store executive was addressing a conference of\nmerchandise managers. She was saying, “I may be a little old-fashioned, but I belong to the school\nthat believes the best way to get customers to come back is to give them friendly, courteous service.\nOne day I was walking through our store when I overheard a salesperson arguing with a customer.\nThe customer left in quite a huff.\n“Afterwards, the salesperson said to another, ‘I’m not going to let a $1.98 customer take up all my\ntime and make me take the store apart trying to find him what he wants. He’s simply not worth it.’\n“I walked away,” the executive continued, “but I couldn’t get that remark out of my mind. It is\n\f\npretty serious, I thought, when our salespeople think of customers as being in the $1.98 category. I\ndecided right then that this concept must be changed. When I got back to my office, I called our\nresearch director and asked him to find out how much the average customer spent in our store last\nyear. The figure he came up with surprised even me. According to our research director’s careful\ncalculation, the typical customer spent $362 in our establishment.\n“The next thing I did was call a meeting of all supervisory personnel and explain the incident to\nthem. Then I showed them what a customer is really worth. Once I got these people to see that a\ncustomer is not to be valued on a single sale but rather on an annual basis, customer service definitely\nimproved.”\nThe point made by the retailing executive applies to any kind of business. It’s repeat business that\nmakes the profit. Often, there’s no profit at all on the first several sales. Look at the potential\nexpenditures of the customers, not just what they buy today.\nPutting a big value on customers is what converts them into big, regular patrons. Attaching little\nvalue to customers sends them elsewhere. A student related this pertinent incident to me, explaining\nwhy he’ll never again eat in a certain cafeteria.\n“For lunch one day,” the student began, “I decided to try a new cafeteria that had just opened a\ncouple of weeks before. Nickels and dimes are pretty important to me right now, so I watch what I\nbuy pretty closely. Walking past the meat section I saw some turkey and dressing that looked pretty\ngood, and it was plainly marked 39 cents.\n“When I got to the cash register, the checker looked at my tray and said, ‘1.09.’ I politely asked\nher to check it again because my tally was 99 cents. After giving me a mean glare, she recounted. The\ndifference turned out to be the turkey. She had charged me 49 cents instead of 39 cents. Then I called\nher attention to the sign, which read 39 cents.\n“This really set her off! ‘I don’t care what that sign says. It’s supposed to be 49 cents. See. Here’s\nmy price list for today. Somebody back there made a mistake. You’ll have to pay the 49 cents.’\n“Then I tried to explain to her the only reason I selected the turkey was because it \nwas\n 39 cents. If\nit had been marked 49 cents I’d have taken something else.\n“To this, her answer was ‘You’ll just have to pay the 49 cents.’ I did, because I didn’t want to\nstand there and create a scene. But I decided on the spot that I’d never eat there again. I spend about\n$250 a year for lunches, and you can be sure they’ll not get one penny of it.”\nThere’s an example of the little view. The checker saw one thin dime, not the potential $250.\n3. The case of the blind milkman.\n It’s surprising how people sometimes are blind to potential. A few\nyears ago a young milkman came to our door to solicit our dairy business. I explained to him that we\nalready had milk delivery service and we were quite satisfied. Then I suggested that he stop next door\nand talk to the lady there.\nTo this he replied, “I’ve already talked to the lady next door, but they use only one quart of milk\nevery two days, and that’s not enough to make it worthwhile for me to stop.”\n“That may be,” I said, “but when you talked to our neighbor, did you not observe that the demand\nfor milk in that household will increase considerably in a month or so? There will be a new addition\nover there that will consume lots of milk.”\nThe young man looked for a moment like he had been struck, and then he said, “How blind can a\nguy be?”\nToday that same one-quart-every-two-days family buys seven quarts every two days from a\nmilkman who had some foresight. That first youngster, a boy, now has two brothers and one sister.\n\f\nAnd I’m told there’ll be another young one soon.\nHow blind can we be? See what can be, not just what is.\nThe schoolteacher who thinks of Jimmy only as he is—an ill-mannered, backward, uncouth brat—\ncertainly will not aid Jimmy’s development. But the teacher who sees Jimmy not as he is now but as\nhe can be, she’ll get results.\nMost folks driving through skid row see only broken-down stumblebums hopelessly lost to the\nbottle. A few devoted people see something else in the skid row–ite; they see a reconstructed citizen.\nAnd because they see this, they succeed in many cases in doing an excellent rehabilitation job.\n4. What determines how much you’re worth?\n After a training session a few weeks ago, a young man\ncame to see me and asked if he could talk with me for a few minutes. I knew that this young fellow,\nnow about twenty-six, had been a very underprivileged child. On top of this, he had experienced a\nmountain of misfortune in his early adult years. I also knew that he was making a real effort to prepare\nhimself for a solid future.\nOver coffee, we quickly worked out his technical problem, and our discussion turned to how\npeople who have few physical possessions should look toward the future. His comments provide a\nstraightforward, sound answer.\n“I’ve got less than $200 in the bank. My job as a rate clerk doesn’t pay much, and it doesn’t carry\nmuch responsibility. My car is four years old, and my wife and I live in a cramped second-floor\napartment.\n“But, Professor,” he continued, “I’m determined not to let what I haven’t got stop me.”\nThat was an intriguing statement, so I urged him to explain.\n“It’s this way,” he went on, “I’ve been analyzing people a lot lately, and I’ve noticed this. People\nwho don’t have much look at themselves as they are now. That’s all they see. They don’t see a future,\nthey just see a miserable present.\n“My neighbor is a good example. He’s continually complaining about having a low-pay job, the\nplumbing that’s always getting fouled up, the lucky breaks somebody else just got, the doctor bills that\nare piling up. He reminds himself so often that he’s poor that now he just assumes that he’s always\ngoing to be poor. He acts as if he were sentenced to living in that broken-down apartment all the rest\nof his life.”\nMy friend was really speaking from the heart, and after a moment’s pause he added, “If I looked at\nmyself strictly as I am—old car, low income, cheap apartment, and hamburger diet—I couldn’t help\nbut be discouraged. I’d see a nobody and I’d \nbe\n a nobody for the rest of my life.\n“I’ve made up my mind to look at myself as the person I’m going to be in a few short years. I see\nmyself not as a rate clerk but as an executive. I don’t see a crummy apartment, I see a fine new\nsuburban home. And when I look at myself that way, I feel bigger and think bigger. And I’ve got plenty\nof personal experiences to prove it’s paying off.”\nIsn’t that a splendid plan for adding value to oneself? This young fellow is on the expressway to\nreally fine living. He’s mastered this basic success principle: It isn’t what one has that’s important.\nRather, it’s how much one is planning to get that counts.\nThe price tag the world puts on us is just about identical to the one we put on ourselves.\nHere is how you can develop your power to see what can be, not just what is. I call these the\n“practice adding value” exercises.\n1. Practice adding value to things. Remember the real estate example. Ask yourself, “What can I do to\n\f\n‘add value’ to this room or this house or this business?” Look for ideas to make things worth more.\nA thing—whether it be a vacant lot, a house, or a business—has value in proportion to the ideas for\nusing it.\n2. Practice adding value to people. As you move higher and higher in the world of success, more and\nmore of your job becomes “people development.” Ask, “What can I do to ‘add value’ to my\nsubordinates? What can I do to help them to become more effective?” Remember, to bring out the\nbest in a person, you must first visualize his best.\n3. Practice adding value to yourself. Conduct a daily interview with yourself. Ask, “What can I do to\nmake myself more valuable today?” Visualize yourself not as you are but as you can be. Then\nspecific ways for attaining your potential value will suggest themselves. Just try and see.\nA retired owner-manager of a medium-size printing company (sixty employees) explained to me how\nhis successor was picked.\n“Five years ago,” my friend began, “I needed an accountant to head up our accounting and office\nroutine. The fellow I hired was named Harry and was only twenty-six. He knew nothing \nabout the\nprinting business, but his record showed he was a good accountant. Yet a year and a half ago, when I\nretired, we made him president and general manager of the company.\n“Looking back on it, Harry had one trait that put him out in front of everyone else. Harry was\nsincerely and actively interested in the whole company, not just writing checks and keeping records.\nWhenever he saw how he could help other employees, he jumped right in.\n“The first year Harry was with me, we lost a few men. Harry came to me with a fringe benefit\nprogram which he promised would cut down turnover at low cost. And it worked.\n“Harry did many other things, too, which helped the whole company, not just this department. He\nmade a detailed cost study of our production department and showed me how a $30,000 investment in\nnew machinery would pay off. Once we experienced a pretty bad sales slump. Harry went to our\nsales manager and said, in effect, ‘I don’t know much about the sales end of the business, but let me\ntry to help.’ And he did. Harry came up with several good ideas which helped us sell more jobs.\n“When a new employee joined us, Harry was right there to help the fellow get comfortable. Harry\ntook a real interest in the entire operation.\n“When I retired, Harry was the only logical person to take over.\n“But don’t misunderstand,” my friend continued, “Harry didn’t try to put himself over on me. He\nwasn’t a mere meddler. He wasn’t aggressive in a negative way. He didn’t stab people in the back,\nand he didn’t go around giving orders. He just went around helping. Harry simply acted as if\neverything in the company affected him. He made company business his business.”\nWe can all learn a lesson from Harry. The “I’m doing my job and that’s enough” attitude is small,\nnegative thinking. Big thinkers see themselves as members of a team effort, as winning or losing with\nthe team, not by themselves. They help in every way they can, even when there is no direct and\nimmediate compensation or other reward. The fellow who shrugs off a problem outside his own\ndepartment with the comment “Well, that’s no concern of mine, let them worry with it” hasn’t got the\nattitude it takes for top leadership.\nPractice this. Practice being a big thinker. See the company’s interest as identical with your own.\nProbably only a very few persons working in large companies have a sincere, unselfish interest in\ntheir company. But after all, only a relatively few persons qualify as big thinkers. And these few are"

    "raw_text": "the ones eventually rewarded with the most responsible, best-paying jobs.\nMany, many potentially powerful people let petty, small, insignificant things block their way to\nachievement. Let’s look at four examples.\n\f\n1. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A GOOD SPEECH?\nJust about everyone wishes he had the “ability” to do a first-class job of speaking in public. But most\npeople don’t get their wish. Most folks are lousy public speakers.\nWhy? The reason is simple: most people concentrate on the small, trivial things of speaking at the\nexpense of the big, important things. In preparing to give a talk, most people give themselves a host of\nmental instructions, like “I’ve got to remember to stand straight,” “Don’t move around and don’t use\nyour hands,” “Don’t let the audience see you use your notes,” “Remember, \ndon’t make mistakes in\ngrammar, especially don’t say ‘for he and I,’ say ‘for him and me,’” “Be sure your tie is straight,”\n“Speak loud, but not too loud,” and so on and on.\nNow, what happens when the speaker gets up to speak? He’s scared because he’s given himself a\nterrific list of things not to do. He gets confused in his talk and finds himself silently asking, “Have I\nmade a mistake?” He is, in brief, a flop. He’s a flop because he concentrated on the petty, trivial,\nrelatively unimportant qualities of a good speaker and failed to concentrate on the big things that make\na good speaker: \nknowledge of what he’s going to talk about and an intense desire to tell it to other\npeople.\nThe real test of a speaker is not did he stand straight or did he make any mistakes in grammar, but\nrather did the audience get the points he wanted to put across. Most of our top speakers have petty\ndefects; some of them even have unpleasant voices. Some of the most sought-after speakers in\nAmerica would flunk a speech course taught by the old negative, “don’t do this and don’t do that,”\nmethod.\nYet all these successful public speakers have one thing in common: \nThey have something to say\nand they feel a burning desire for other people to hear it.\nDon’t let concern with trivia keep you from speaking successfully in public."

    "raw_text": "2. WHAT CAUSES QUARRELS?\nEver stop to ask yourself just what causes quarrels? At least 99 percent of the time, quarrels start\nover petty, unimportant matters like this: John comes home a little tired, a little on edge. Dinner\ndoesn’t exactly please him, so he turns up his nose and complains. Joan’s day wasn’t perfect either, so\nshe rallies to her own defense \nwith “Well, what do you expect on my food budget?” or “Maybe I\ncould cook better if I had a new stove like everybody else.” This insults John’s pride, so he attacks\nwith “Now, Joan, it’s not lack of money; it’s simply that you don’t know how to manage.”\nAnd away they go! Before a truce is finally declared, all sorts of accusations are made by each\nparty. In-laws, sex, money, premarital and postmarital promises, and other issues will be introduced.\nBoth parties leave the battle nervous, tense. Nothing has been settled, and both parties have new\nammunition to make the next quarrel more vicious. Little things, petty thinking, causes arguments. So,\nto eliminate quarrels, eliminate petty thinking.\nHere’s a technique that works: before complaining or accusing or reprimanding someone or\nlaunching a counterattack in self-defense, ask yourself, “Is it really important?” In most cases, it isn’t\nand you avoid conflict.\nAsk yourself, “Is it really important if he (or she) is messy with cigarettes or forgets to put the cap\non the toothpaste or is late coming home?”\n“Is it really important if he (or she) squandered a little money or invited some people in I don’t\nlike?”\nWhen you feel like taking negative action, ask yourself, “Is it really important?” That question\nworks magic in building a finer home situation. It works at the office, too. It works in home-going\ntraffic when another driver cuts in ahead of you. It works in any situation in life that is apt to produce\nquarrels."

    "raw_text": "3. JOHN GOT THE SMALLEST OFFICE AND FIZZLED OUT\nSeveral years ago, I observed small thinking about an office assignment destroy a young fellow’s\nchances for a profitable career in advertising.\nFour young executives, all on the same status level, were moved into new offices. Three of the\noffices were identical in size and decoration. The fourth was smaller and less elaborate.\nJ. M. was assigned the fourth office. This turned out to be a real blow to his pride. Immediately he\nfelt discriminated against. Negative thinking, resentment, bitterness, jealousy built up. J. M. began to\nfeel inadequate. The result was that J. M. grew hostile toward his fellow executives. Rather than\ncooperate, he did his best to undermine their efforts. Things got worse. Three months later J. M.\nslipped so badly that management had no choice but to issue him a pink slip.\nSmall thinking over a very small matter stopped J. M. In his haste to feel he was discriminated\nagainst, J. M. failed to observe that the company was expanding rapidly and office space was at a\npremium. He didn’t stop to consider the possibility that the executive who made the office\nassignments didn’t even know which one was the smallest! No one in the organization, except J. M.,\nregarded his office as an index of his value.\nSmall thinking about unimportant things like seeing your name last on the department route sheet\nor getting the fourth carbon of an office memo can hurt you. Think big, and none of these little things\ncan hold you back.\n\f\n4. EVEN STUTTERING IS A DETAIL\nA sales executive told me how even stuttering is a mere detail in salesmanship if the fellow has the\nreally important qualities.\n“I have a friend, also a sales executive, who loves to play practical jokes, though sometimes these\njokes aren’t jokes at all. A few months ago a young fellow called on my practical-joking friend \nand\nasked for a sales job. The fellow had a terrible stutter, though, and my friend decided right here was a\nchance to play a joke on me. So the friend told the stammering applicant that he wasn’t in the market\nfor a salesman right now but one of his friends (me) had a spot to fill. Then he phoned me, and, boy,\ndid he give this fellow a buildup. Not suspecting anything, I said, ‘Send him right over!’\n“Thirty minutes later, in he walked. The young fellow hadn’t said three words before I knew why\nmy friend was so eager to send him over. ‘I-I-I’m J-J-Jack R.,’ he said, ‘Mr. X sent me over t-t-to talk\nt-t-to you about a j-j-job.’ Almost every word was a struggle. I thought to myself, ‘This guy couldn’t\nsell a dollar bill for 90 cents on Wall Street.’ I was sore at my friend, but I really felt sorry for this\nfellow, so I thought the least I could do was to ask him some polite questions while I thought up a\ngood excuse as to why I couldn’t use him.\n“As we talked on, however, I discovered this fellow was no stupe. He was intelligent. He\nhandled himself very nicely, but I just couldn’t overlook the fact that he stuttered. Finally, I decided\nI’d wind up the interview by asking one last question. ‘What makes you think you can sell?’\n“‘Well,’ he said, ‘I learn f-f-fast, I-I-I like people, I-I-I think you’ve got a good company, and I-I-I\nwant t-t-to make m-m-money. Now, I-I-I do have a speech im-im-pairment, b-b-but that doesn’t b-b-\nbother me, so why should it b-b-bother anybody else?’\n“His answer showed me he had all the really important qualifications for a salesman. I decided\nright then to give him a chance. And you know, he’s working out very well.”\nEven a speech impairment in a talker’s profession is a triviality if the person has the big qualities.\nPractice these three procedures to help yourself think about trivialities:\n1. Keep your eyes focused on the big objective. Many times we’re like the salesman who, failing to\nmake the sale, reports to his manager, “Yes, but I sure convinced the customer he was wrong.” In\nselling, the big objective is winning sales, not arguments.\nIn marriage the big objective is peace, happiness, tranquillity—not winning quarrels or saying\n“I could have told you so.”\nIn working with employees, the big objective is developing their full potential, not making\nissues out of their minor errors.\nIn living with neighbors, the big objective is mutual respect and friendship—not seeing if you\ncan have their dog impounded because once in a while it barks at night.\nParaphrasing some military lingo, it is much better to lose a battle and win the war than to win\na battle and lose the war.\nResolve to keep your eyes on the big ball.\n2. Ask “Is it really important?” Before becoming negatively excited, just ask yourself, “Is it important\nenough for me to get all worked up about?” There is no better way to avoid frustration over petty\nmatters than to use this medicine. At least 90 percent of quarrels and feuds would never take place\nif we just faced troublesome situations with “Is this really important?”\n3. Don’t fall into the triviality trap. In making speeches, solving problems, counseling employees,\n\f\nthink of those things that really matter, things that make the difference. Don’t become submerged\nunder surface issues. Concentrate on important things.\n\f\nTAKE THIS TEST TO MEASURE THE SIZE OF YOUR THINKING\nIn the left-hand column below are listed several common situations. In the middle and right-hand\ncolumns are comparisons of how petty thinkers and big thinkers see the same situation. Check\nyourself. Then decide, which will get me where I want to go? Petty thinking or big thinking?\nThe same situation handled in two entirely different ways.

Practice adding value to things, to people,\nand to yourself.\n4. Get the big view of your job. Think, really think your present job is important. That next promotion\ndepends mostly on how you think toward your \npresent\n job.\n5. Think above trivial things. Focus your attention on big objectives.

    "raw_text": "HOW TO THINK AND DREAM\nCREATIVELY\nFirst, let’s clear up a common fallacy about the meaning of \ncreative thinking.\n For some illogical\nreason, science, engineering, art, and writing got tabbed as about the only truly creative pursuits.\nMost people associate creative thinking with things like the discovery of electricity or polio vaccine,\nor the writing of a novel or the development of color television.\nCertainly, accomplishments like these are evidence of creative thinking. Each forward step made\nin the conquest of space is the result of creative thinking, lots of it. But creative thinking is not\nreserved for certain occupations, nor is it restricted to superintelligent people.\nWell, then, what is creative thinking?\nA low-income family devises a plan to send their son to a leading university. That’s creative\nthinking.\nA family turns the street’s most undesirable lot into the neighborhood beauty spot. That’s creative\nthinking.\nA minister develops a plan that doubles his Sunday evening attendance. That’s creative thinking.\nFiguring out ways to simplify record keeping, selling the “impossible” customer, keeping the\nchildren occupied constructively, \nmaking employees really like their work, or preventing a “certain”\nquarrel—all of these are examples of practical, everyday creative thinking.\nCreative thinking is simply finding new, improved ways to do anything. The rewards of all types\nof success—success in the home, at work, in the community—hinge on finding ways to do things\nbetter. Now let’s see what we can do to develop and strengthen our creative thinking ability.\nStep one: Believe it can be done.\n Here is a basic truth: To do \nanything\n, we must first believe it can\nbe done. Believing something can be done sets the mind in motion to find a way to do it.\nTo illustrate this point of creative thinking in training sessions, I often use this example: I ask the\ngroup, “How many of you feel it is possible to eliminate jails within the next thirty years?”\nInvariably the group looks bewildered, not quite sure they heard right and thinking they are\nlistening to a real fuzzy-wuzzy. So after a pause I repeat, “How many of you feel it is possible to\neliminate jails within the next thirty years?”\nOnce they’re sure I’m not joking, someone always blasts me with something like “You mean to\nsay you want to turn all those murderers, thieves, and rapists loose? Don’t you realize what this\nwould mean? Why, none of us would be safe. We \nhave\n to have jails.”\nThen the others cut loose:\n“All order would break down if we didn’t have jails.”\n“Some people are born criminals.”\n“If anything, we need more jails.”\n“Did you read in this morning’s paper about that murder?”\n\f\nAnd the group goes on, telling me all sorts of \ngood\n reasons why we must have jails. One fellow\neven suggested we’ve got to have jails so the police and prison guards can have jobs.\nAfter about ten minutes of letting the group “prove” why we can’t eliminate the need for jails, I\nsay to them, “Now let me mention here that this question of eliminating jails is used to make a point.\n“Each of you has come up with reasons why we can’t eliminate the need for jails. Will you do me\na favor? Will you try extra hard for a few minutes to believe we \ncan\n eliminate jails?”\nJoining in the spirit of the experiment, the group says, in effect, “Oh, well, but just for kicks.”\nThen I ask, “Now, assuming we can eliminate jails, how could we begin?”\nSuggestions come slowly at first. Someone hesitantly says something like, “Well, you might cut\ndown crime if you established more youth centers.”\nBefore long, the group, which ten minutes ago was solidly against the idea, now begins to work\nup real enthusiasm.\n“Work to eliminate poverty. Most crime stems from the low income levels.”\n“Conduct research to spot potential criminals before they commit a crime.”\n“Develop surgical procedures to cure some kinds of criminals.”\n“Educate law enforcement personnel in positive methods of reform.”\nThese are just samples of the seventy-eight specific ideas I’ve tabulated that could help\naccomplish the goal of eliminating jails. WHEN YOU \nBELIEVE\n, YOUR MIND FINDS WAYS TO\nDO.\nThis experiment has just one point: \nWhen you believe something\n \nis impossible, your mind goes\nto work for you to prove why. But when you believe, really believe, something can be done, your\nmind goes to work for you and helps you find the ways to do it.\nBelieving something can be done paves the way for creative solutions. Believing something can’t\nbe done is destructive thinking. This point applies to all situations, little and big. The political\nleaders who do not genuinely believe permanent world peace can be established will fail because\ntheir minds are closed to creative ways to bring about peace. The economists who believe business\ndepressions are inevitable will not develop creative ways to beat the business cycle.\nIn a similar fashion, you \ncan\n find ways to like a person if you believe you can.\nYou \ncan\n discover solutions to personal problems if you believe you can.\nYou \ncan\n find a way to purchase that new, larger home if you believe you can.\nBelief releases creative powers. Disbelief puts the brakes on.\nBelieve\n, and you’ll start thinking—constructively.\nYour mind will create a way if you let it.\n A little over two years ago a young man asked me to help\nhim find a job with more future. He was employed as a clerk in the credit department of a mail-order\ncompany and felt that he was getting nowhere. We talked about his past record and what he wanted to\ndo. After knowing something about him, I said, “I admire you very much for wanting to move up the\nladder to a better job and more responsibility. But getting a start in the kind of job you want requires a\ncollege degree these days. I notice you’ve finished three semesters. \nMay I suggest you finish college.\nGoing summers, you can do it in two years. Then I’m sure you can land the job you want, with the\ncompany you want to work for.”\n“I realize,” he answered, “that a college education would help. But it’s impossible for me to go\nback to school.”\n“Impossible? Why?” I asked.\n“Well, for one thing,” he began, “I’m twenty-four. On top of that, my wife and I are expecting our\n\f\nsecond child in a couple of months. We barely get by now on what I make. I wouldn’t have time to\nstudy since I’d have to keep my job. It’s just impossible, that’s all.”\nThis young man really had himself convinced that finishing college was impossible.\nThen I said to him, “If you believe it is impossible to finish school, then it is. But by the same\ntoken, if you’ll just believe it is possible to return to the university, a solution will come.\n“Now, here’s what I would like you to do. Make up your mind you are going to go back to school.\nLet that one thought dominate your thinking. Then think, really think, about how you can do it and still\nsupport your family. Come back in a couple of weeks and let me know what ideas you’ve come up\nwith.”\nMy young friend returned two weeks later.\n“I thought a lot about what you said,” he began. “I’ve decided I must go back to school. I haven’t\nfigured out all the angles yet, but I’ll find a solution.”\nAnd he did.\nHe managed to get a scholarship provided by a trade association, which paid his tuition, books,\nand incidentals. He rearranged his work schedule so he could attend classes. His enthusiasm and the\npromise of a better life won him his wife’s full \nsupport. Together they creatively found ways to\nbudget money and time more effectively.\nLast month he received his degree one day and went to work the next as a management trainee for\na large corporation.\nWhere there’s a will, there \nis\n a way.\nBelieve it can be done.\n That’s basic to creative thinking. Here are suggestions to help you develop\ncreative power through belief:\n1. Eliminate the word \nimpossible\n from your thinking and speaking vocabularies. \nImpossible\n is a\nfailure word. The thought “It’s impossible” sets off a chain reaction of other thoughts to prove\nyou’re right.\n2. Think of something special you’ve been wanting to do but felt you couldn’t. Now make a list of\nreasons why you can do it. Many of us whip and defeat our desires simply because we concentrate\non why we can’t when the only thing worthy of our mental concentration is why we can.\nRecently I read a newspaper item that said there are too many counties in most states. The article\npointed out that most county boundaries were established decades before the first automobile was\nbuilt and while the horse and buggy was the chief mode of travel. But today, with fast automobiles\nand good roads, there is no reason why three or four counties could not be combined. This would cut\ndown greatly on duplicated services so that taxpayers would actually get better service for less\nmoney.\nThe writer of this article said he thought he had stumbled across a really live idea, so he\ninterviewed thirty people at random \nto get their reactions. The result: not one person thought the idea\nhad merit, even though it would provide them with better local government at less cost.\nThat’s an example of traditional thinking. The traditional thinker’s mind is paralyzed. He reasons,\n“It’s been this way for a hundred years. Therefore, it must be good and must stay this way. Why risk a\nchange?”\n“Average” people have always resented progress. Many voiced a protest toward the automobile\n\f\non the grounds that nature meant for us to walk or use horses. The airplane seemed drastic to many.\nMan had no “right” to enter the province “reserved” for birds. A lot of “status-quo-ers” still insist\nthat man has no business in space.\nOne top missile expert recently gave an answer to this kind of thinking. “Man belongs,” says Dr.\nvon Braun, “where man wants to go.”\nAround 1900 a sales executive discovered a “scientific” principle of sales management. It\nreceived a lot of publicity and even found its way into textbooks. The principle was this: There is one\nbest way to sell a product. Find the best way. Then never deviate from it.\nFortunately for this man’s company, new leadership came in in time to save the organization from\nfinancial ruin.\nContrast that experience with the philosophy of Crawford H. Greenewalt, president of one of the\nnation’s largest business organizations, E. I. du Pont de Nemours. In a talk at Columbia University,\nMr. Greenewalt said, “. . . there are many ways in which a good job can be done—as many ways, in\nfact, as there are men to whom the task is given.”\nIn truth, there is no one best way to do anything. There \nis no one best way to decorate an\napartment, landscape a lawn, make a sale, rear a child, or cook a steak. There are as many best ways\nas there are creative minds.\nNothing grows in ice. If we let tradition freeze our minds, new ideas can’t sprout. Make this test\nsometime soon. Propose one of the ideas below to someone and then watch his behavior.\n1. The postal system, long a government monopoly, should be turned over to private enterprise.\n2. Presidential elections should be held every two or six years instead of four.\n3. Regular hours for retail stores should be 1 \nP.M.\n to 8 \nP.M.\n, instead of 9 \nA.M.\n to 5:30 \nP.M.\n4. The retirement age should be raised to seventy.\nWhether these ideas are sound or practical is not the point. What is significant is how a person\nhandles propositions like these. If he laughs at the idea and doesn’t give it a second thought (and\nprobably 95 percent will laugh at it) chances are he suffers from tradition paralysis. But the one in\ntwenty who says, “That’s an interesting idea; tell me more about it,” has a mind that’s turned to\ncreativity.\nTraditional thinking is personal enemy number one for the person who is interested in a creative\npersonal success program. Traditional thinking freezes your mind, blocks your progress, and prevents\nyou from developing creative power. Here are three ways to fight it:\n1. Become receptive to ideas. Welcome new ideas. Destroy these thought repellents: “Won’t work,”\n“Can’t be done,” “It’s useless,” and “It’s stupid.”\nA very successful friend of mine who holds a major position with an insurance company said\nto me, “I don’t pretend to be the smartest guy in the business. But I think I am the best sponge in the\ninsurance industry. I make it a point to soak up all the good ideas I can.”\n2. Be an experimental person. Break up fixed routines. Expose yourself to new restaurants, new\nbooks, new theaters, new friends; take a different route to work someday, take a different vacation"

    "raw_text": "this year, do something new and different this weekend.\nIf your work is in distribution, develop an interest in production, accounting, finance, and the\nother elements of business. This gives you breadth and prepares you for larger responsibilities.\n3. Be progressive, not regressive. Not “That’s the way we did it where I used to work, so we ought to\ndo it that way here” but “How can we do it better than we did it where I used to work?” Not\nbackward, regressive thinking but forward, progressive thinking. Because you got up at 5:30 \nA.M.\nto deliver papers or milk the cows when you were a youngster doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good\nidea for you to require your children to do the same.\nImagine what would happen to the Ford Motor Company if its management allowed itself to think,\n“This year we’ve built the ultimate in automobiles. Further improvement is impossible. Therefore, all\nexperimental engineering and designing activities are hereby permanently terminated.” Even the\nmammoth Ford Motor Company would shrivel fast with this attitude.\nSuccessful people, like successful businesses, live with these questions: “How can I improve the\nquality of my performance? How can I do better?”\nAbsolute perfection in all human undertakings from building missiles to rearing children is\nunattainable. This means there is endless room for improvement. Successful people know this, and\nthey are always searching for a better way. (Note: The successful person doesn’t ask, “Can I do it\nbetter?” He \nknows\n he can. So he phrases the question: “\nHow\n can I do it better?”)\nA few months ago, a former student of mine, in business for just four years, opened her fourth\nhardware store. This was quite a feat, considering the young lady’s small initial capital investment of\nonly $3,500, strong competition from other stores, and the relatively short time she had been in\nbusiness.\nI visited her new store shortly after it opened to congratulate her on the fine progress she had\nmade.\nIn an indirect way I asked her how she was able to make a success of three stores and open a\nfourth one when most merchants had to struggle to make a success of just one store.\n“Naturally,” she answered, “I worked hard, but just getting up early and working late isn’t\nresponsible for the four stores. Most people in my business work hard. The main thing I attribute my\nsuccess to is my self-styled ‘weekly improvement program.’”\n“A weekly improvement program? Sounds impressive. How does it work?” I asked.\n“Well, it really isn’t anything elaborate,” she continued, “it’s just a plan to help me do a better job\nas each week rolls around.\n“To keep my forward thinking on the track, I’ve divided my job into four elements: customers,\nemployees, merchandise, and promotion. All during the week I make notes and jot down ideas as to\nhow I can improve my business.\n“Then, every Monday evening, I set aside four hours to review the ideas I’ve jotted down and\nfigure out how to put the solid ones to use in the business.\n“In this four-hour period I force myself to take a hard look at my operation. I don’t simply wish\nmore customers would shop in my store. Instead I ask myself, ‘What can I do to attract more\ncustomers?’ ‘How can I develop regular, loyal customers?’”\nShe went on describing numerous little innovations that made her first three stores so successful:\nthings like the way she arranged the merchandise within her stores, her suggestion-selling technique\nthat sold two out of three customers merchandise they had not planned to buy when they entered her\n\f\nstores, the credit plan she devised when many of her customers were out of work because of a strike,\nthe contest she developed that boosted sales during a slack season.\n“I ask myself, ‘What can I do to improve my merchandise offerings?’ and I get ideas. Let me cite\njust one case. Four weeks ago, it occurred to me that I should do something to get more youngsters\ninto the store. I reasoned, if I had something here to draw the kids to the store, I’d also draw more of\nthe parents. I kept thinking about it, and then this idea came: Put in a line of small carded toys for\nchildren in the four-to-eight age bracket. It’s \nworking! The toys take little space and I make a nice\nprofit on them. But, most important, the toys have increased store traffic.\n“Believe me,” she went on, “my weekly improvement plan works. Just by conscientiously asking\nmyself, ‘How can I do a better job?’ I find the answers. It’s a rare Monday night that I don’t come up\nwith some plan or technique that makes that profit and loss statement look better.\n“And I’ve learned something else too about successful merchandising, something that I think every\nperson going into business for himself should know.”\n“What’s that?” I asked.\n“Just this: It isn’t so much what you know when you start that matters. It’s what you learn and put\nto use after you open your doors that counts most.”\nBig success calls for persons who continually set higher standards for themselves and others,\npersons who are searching for ways to increase efficiency, to get more output at lower cost, do more\nwith less effort. Top success is reserved for the I-can-do-it-better kind of person.\nGeneral Electric uses the slogan “Progress is our most important product.”\nWhy not make progress your most important product?\nThe I-can-do-better philosophy works magic. When you ask yourself, “How can I do better?”\nyour creative power is switched on and ways for doing things better suggest themselves.\nHere is a daily exercise that will help you discover and develop the power of the I-can-do-better\nattitude.\nEach day before you begin work, devote ten minutes to thinking “How can I do a better job\ntoday?” Ask, “What can I do today to encourage my employees?” “What special favor \ncan I do for my\ncustomers?” “How can I increase my personal efficiency?”\nThis exercise is simple. But it works. Try it, and you’ll find unlimited creative ways to win\ngreater success.\n*\nJust about every time my wife and I would get together with a certain couple, the conversation would\nturn to “working wives.” Mrs. S. had worked several years before her marriage, and she had\ngenuinely liked it.\n“But now,” she’d say, “I’ve got two youngsters in school, a home to manage, and meals to\nprepare. I simply haven’t got time.”\nThen, one Sunday evening, Mr. and Mrs. S. and their children were in an automobile accident.\nMrs. S. and the youngsters escaped serious injury, but Mr. S. received a back injury that left him\npermanently disabled. Now Mrs. S. had no choice but to go to work.\nWhen we saw her several months after the accident, we were amazed to find how well she had\nadjusted to her new responsibilities.\n“You know,” she said, “six months ago I never dreamed I could possibly manage the house and\nwork full-time. But after the accident, I just made up my mind that I had to find the time. Believe me,\n\f\nmy efficiency has gone up 100 percent. I discovered a lot of things I was doing didn’t need to be done\nat all. Then I discovered that the children could and wanted to help. I found dozens of ways to\nconserve time—fewer trips to the store, less TV, less telephoning, less of those time killers.”\nThis experience teaches us a lesson: \nCapacity is a state of mind.\n How much we can do depends\non how much we think we \ncan do. When you really believe you can do more, your mind thinks\ncreatively and shows you the way.\nA young bank executive related this personal experience about “work capacity.”\n“One of the other executives in our bank left us with very short notice. This put our department on\nthe spot. The fellow leaving had filled an important job, and his work couldn’t be postponed or left\nundone.\n“The day after he left, the vice president in charge of my department called me in. He explained to\nme that he had already talked individually to the two others in my group, asking them if they could\ndivide the work of the man who had just left until a replacement could be found. ‘Neither of them\nflatly refused,’ said the vice president, ‘but each stated that he is up to his neck now with his own\npressing work. I’m wondering if you could handle some of the overload temporarily?’\n“Throughout my working career, I’ve learned that it never pays to turn down what looks like an\nopportunity. So I agreed and promised to do my very best to handle all the vacated job as well as\nkeep up with my own work. The vice president was pleased at this.\n“I walked out of his office knowing I had taken on a big job. I was just as busy as the two others\nin my department who had wiggled out of this extra duty. But I was determined to find a way to handle\nboth jobs. I finished up my work that afternoon, and when the offices were closed, I sat down to\nfigure out how I could increase my personal efficiency. I got a pencil and started writing down every\nidea I could think of.\n“And you know, I came up with some good ones: like working out an arrangement with my\nsecretary to channel all routine \ntelephone calls to me during a certain hour each day, placing all\noutgoing calls during a certain hour, cutting my usual conference periods from fifteen minutes to ten,\ngiving all my dictation at one time each day. I also discovered my secretary could—and was eager to\n—take over a number of little time-consuming details for me.\n“I had been handling my present job for over two years, and frankly, I was amazed to discover\nhow much inefficiency I had let creep in.\n“Within a week’s time, I was dictating twice as many letters, handling 50 percent more phone\ncalls, attending half again as many meetings—all with no strain.\n“A couple more weeks passed. The vice president called me in. He complimented me on doing a\nfine job. He went on to say that he had looked over a number of people from both inside and outside\nthe bank but he had not yet found the right man. Then he confessed that he had already cleared with the\nbank’s executive committee, and they had authorized him to combine the two jobs, put them both in my\ncharge, and give me a substantial increase in salary.\n“I proved to myself that how much I can do depends on how much I think I can do.”\nCapacity \nis\n indeed a state of mind.\nEvery day, it seems, this takes place in the fast-moving world of business. The boss calls in an\nemployee and explains that a special task must be accomplished. Then he says, “I know you’ve got a\nlot of work to do, but can you handle this?” Too often the employee replies, “I’m awfully sorry, but\nI’m all loaded down now. I wish I could take it on, but I’m just too busy.”\nUnder the circumstances, the boss doesn’t hold it against the employee, because it is “extra duty,”\nso to speak. But the boss realizes the task must be done, and he’ll keep looking until he finds an\n\f\nemployee who is just as busy as the rest but who feels he can take on more. And this employee is the\nfellow who will forge ahead.\nIn business, in the home, in the community, the success combination is \ndo what you do better\n(improve the quality of your output) and \ndo more of what you do\n (increase the quantity of your\noutput).\nConvinced it pays to do more and better? Then try this two-step procedure\n:\n1. Eagerly accept the opportunity to do more. It’s a compliment to be asked to take on a new\nresponsibility. Accepting greater responsibility on the job makes you stand out and shows that\nyou’re more valuable. When your neighbors ask you to represent them on a civic matter, accept. It\nhelps you to become a community leader.\n2. Next, concentrate on “How can I do more?” Creative answers will come. Some of these answers\nmay be better planning and organization of your present work or taking intelligent shortcuts in your\nroutine activities, or possibly dropping nonessential activities altogether. But, let me repeat, the\nsolution for doing more will appear.\nAs a personal policy I have accepted fully the concept: If you want it done, give it to a busy man. I\nrefuse to work on important projects with persons who have lots of free time. I \nhave learned from\npainful, expensive experience that the fellow who has plenty of time makes an ineffective work\npartner.\nAll the successful, competent people I know are busy. When I start something, some project, with\nthem, I know it will be satisfactorily completed.\nI have learned in dozens of instances that I can count on a busy man to deliver. But I have often\nbeen disappointed in working with people who have “all the time in the world.”\nProgressive business management constantly asks, “What can we do to expand output?” Why not\nask yourself, “What can I do to expand my output?” Your mind will creatively show you how.\nIn hundreds of interviews with people at all levels I’ve made this discovery: The bigger the\nperson, the more apt he is to encourage \nyou\n to talk; the smaller the person, the more apt he is to\npreach to you.\nBig people monopolize the \nlistening.\nSmall people monopolize the \ntalking.\nNote this also: Top-level leaders in all walks of life spend much more time requesting advice than\nthey do in giving it. Before a top man makes a decision, he asks, “How do you feel about it?” “What\ndo you recommend?” “What would you do under these circumstances?” “How does this sound to\nyou?”\nLook at it this way: A leader is a decision-making human machine. Now, to manufacture anything,\nyou’ve got to have raw material. In reaching creative decisions, the raw materials are the ideas and\nsuggestions of others. Don’t, of course, expect other people to give you ready-made solutions. That’s\nnot the primary reason for asking and listening. Ideas of others help to spark your own ideas so your\nmind is more creative.\nRecently I participated as a staff instructor in an executive \nmanagement seminar. The seminar\nconsisted of twelve sessions. One of the highlights of each meeting was a fifteen-minute discussion by\none of the executives on the topic “How I solved my most pressing management problem.”\n\f\nAt the ninth session, the executive whose turn it was, a vice president of a large milk-processing\ncompany, did something different. Instead of telling how he had solved his problem, he announced his\ntopic as “Needed: Help on solving my most pressing management problem.” He quickly outlined his\nproblem and then asked the group for ideas on solving it. To be sure he got a record of each idea\nsuggested, he had a stenographer in the room taking down everything that was said.\nLater I talked with this man and complimented him on his unique approach. His comment was\n“There are some very sharp men in this group. I just figured I’d harvest some ideas. There’s a good\npossibility something someone said during that session may give me the clue I need to solve the\nproblem.”\nNote: this executive presented his problem, then \nlistened.\n In so doing, he got some decision-\nmaking raw material, and, as a side benefit, the other executives in the audience enjoyed the\ndiscussion because it gave them the opportunity to take part.\nSuccessful businesses invest large sums in consumer research. They ask people about the taste,\nquality, size, and appearance of a product. Listening to people provides definite ideas for making the\nproduct more salable. It also suggests to the manufacturer what he should tell consumers about the\nproduct in his advertising. The procedure for developing successful products is to get as much\nopinion as you can, listen to the people who will buy the product, and then design the product and its\npromotion to please these people.\nIn an office recently I noticed a sign that said, “To sell John Brown what John Brown buys,\nyou’ve got to see things through John Brown’s eyes.” And the way to get John Brown’s vision is to\nlisten to what John Brown has to say.\nYour ears are your intake valves. They feed your mind raw materials that can be converted into\ncreative power. We learn nothing from telling. But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking\nand listening.\nTry this three-stage program to strengthen your creativity through asking and listening:\n1. Encourage others to talk. In personal conversation or in group meetings, draw out people with little\nurges, such as “Tell me about your experience . . .” or “What do you think should be done\nabout . . .?” or “What do you think is the key point?” Encourage others to talk, and you win a\ndouble-barreled victory: your mind soaks up raw material that you can use to produce creative\nthought, and you win friends. There is no surer way to get people to like you than to encourage them\nto talk to you.\n2. Test your own views in the form of questions. Let other people help you smooth and polish your\nideas. Use the what-do-you-think-of-this-suggestion? approach. Don’t be dogmatic. Don’t announce\na fresh idea as if it were handed down on a gold tablet. Do a little informal research first. See how\nyour associates react to it. If you do, chances are you’ll end up with a better idea.\n3. Concentrate on what the other person says. Listening is more than just keeping your own mouth\nshut. Listening means letting what’s said penetrate your mind. So often people pretend to listen\nwhen they aren’t listening at all. They’re just waiting for the other person to pause so they can take\nover with the talking. Concentrate on what the other person says. Evaluate it. That’s how you\ncollect mind food.\nMore and more leading universities are offering advanced management training programs for\n\f\nsenior business executives. According to the sponsors, the big benefit of these programs is not that the\nexecutives get ready-made formulae that they can use to operate their business more efficiently.\nRather, they benefit most from the opportunity to exchange and discuss new ideas. Many of these\nprograms require the executives to live together in college dormitories, thus encouraging bull\nsessions. Boiled down to one word, the executives benefit most from the \nstimulation\n received.\nA year ago I directed two sessions in a one-week sales management school in Atlanta sponsored\nby the National Sales Executives, Inc. A few weeks later I met a salesman friend who worked for one\nof the sales executives who’d attended the school.\n“You people at the school sure gave my sales manager a lot of things to do to run our company\nbetter,” my young friend said. Curious, I asked him specifically what changes he’d noticed. He reeled\noff a number of things—a revision in the compensation plan, sales meetings twice a month instead of\nonce a month, new business cards and stationery, a revision in sales territories—not one of which\nwas specifically recommended in the training program. The sales manager didn’t get a bunch of\ncanned techniques. Instead, he got something much more valuable, the stimulation to think of ideas\ndirectly beneficial to his own particular organization.\nA young accountant for a paint manufacturer told me about a very successful venture of his that\nwas sparked by ideas of others.\n“I never had had more than a casual interest in real estate,” he told me. “I’ve been a professional\naccountant for several years now, and I’ve stuck pretty close to my profession. One day a Realtor\nfriend invited me to be his guest at a luncheon of one of the city’s real estate groups.\n“The speaker that day was an older man who had seen the city grow. His talk was about ‘The\nNext Twenty Years.’ He predicted that the metropolitan area would continue to grow far out into the\nsurrounding farmland. He also predicted that there would be a record demand for what he called\ngentlemen-size farms, two to five acres, big enough so the businessman or professional person could\nhave a pool, horses, a garden, and other hobbies that require space.\n“This man’s talk really stimulated me. What he described was exactly what I wanted. The next\nfew days I asked several friends what they thought about the idea of someday owning a five-acre\nestate. Everyone I talked to said, in effect, ‘I’d love that.’\n“I continued to think about it and to figure how I could turn the idea into profit. Then one day as I\nwas driving to work the answer came out of nowhere. Why not buy a farm and divide it into estates? I\nfigured the land might be worth more in relatively small pieces than in one big piece.\n“Twenty-two miles from the center of the city, I found a worn-out fifty-acre farm priced at $8,500.\nI bought it, paying only one-third down and working out a mortgage with the owner for the balance.\n“Next, I planted pine seedlings where there were no trees. I did this because a real estate man\nwhom I feel knows his business told me, ‘People want trees these days, lots of trees!’\n“I wanted my prospective buyers to see that in a few years their estate would be covered with\nbeautiful pine trees.\n“Then I got a surveyor to divide the fifty acres into ten five-acre plots.\n“Now I was ready to start selling. I got several mailing lists of young executives in the city and\nput on a small-scale direct-mail campaign. I pointed out how, for only $3,000, the price of a small\ncity lot, they could buy an estate. I also described the potentials for recreation and wholesome living.\n“In six weeks’ time, working only evenings and on weekends, I sold all ten plots. Total income:\n$30,000. Total costs, including the land, advertising, surveying and legal expenses: $10,400. Profit:\n$19,600.\n“I made a nice profit because I let myself be exposed to ideas of other intelligent people. Had I\n\f\nnot accepted that invitation to attend a luncheon with a group completely foreign to my occupational\ninterests, my brain would have never worked out this successful plan for making a profit.”\nThere are many ways to get mental stimulation, but here are two that you can incorporate into your\npattern of life.\nFirst, join and meet regularly with at least one professional group that provides stimulation in\nyour own occupational area. Rub shoulders—and minds—with other success-oriented people. \nSo\noften I hear someone say, “I picked up a great idea this noon at the —— meeting” or “During the\nmeeting yesterday I got to thinking . . .” Remember, a mind that feeds only on itself soon is\nundernourished, becoming weak and incapable of creative progressive thought. Stimulation from\nothers is excellent mind food.\nSecond, join and participate in at least one group outside your occupational interests. Association\nwith people who have different job interests broadens your thinking and helps you to see the big\npicture. You’ll be surprised how mixing regularly with people outside your occupational area will\nstimulate your on-the-job thinking.\nIdeas are fruits of your thinking. But they’ve got to be harnessed and put to work to have value.\nEach year an oak tree produces enough acorns to populate a good-sized forest. Yet from these\nbushels of seeds perhaps only one or two acorns will become a tree. The squirrels destroy most of\nthem, and the hard ground beneath the tree doesn’t give the few remaining seeds much chance for a\nstart.\nSo it is with ideas. Very few bear fruit. Ideas are highly perishable. If we’re not on guard, the\nsquirrels (negative-thinking people) will destroy most of them. Ideas require special handling from\nthe time they are born until they’re transformed into practical ways for doing things better. Use these\nthree ways to harness and develop your ideas:\n1. Don’t let ideas escape. Write them down. Every day lots of good ideas are born only to die quickly\nbecause they aren’t nailed to paper. Memory is a weak slave when it comes to preserving and\nnurturing brand-new ideas. Carry a notebook \nor some small cards with you. When you get an idea,\nwrite it down. A friend who travels a lot keeps a clipboard beside him so that he can write down\nan idea the instant it occurs to him. People with fertile, creative minds know a good idea may\nsprout any time, any place. Don’t let ideas escape; else you destroy the fruits of your thinking.\nFence them in.\n2. Next, review your ideas. File these ideas in an active file. The file can be an elaborate cabinet, or\nit can be a desk drawer. A shoe box will do. But build a file and then examine your storehouse of\nideas regularly. As you go over your ideas, some may, for very good reasons, have no value at all.\nGet rid of them. But so long as the idea has any promise, keep it.\n3. Cultivate and fertilize your idea. Now make your idea grow. Think about it. Tie the idea to related\nideas. Read anything you can find that is in any way akin to your idea. Investigate all angles. Then,\nwhen the time is ripe, put it to work for yourself, your job, your future.\nWhen an architect gets an idea for a new building, he makes a preliminary drawing. When a creative\nadvertising person gets an idea for a new TV commercial, he puts it into storyboard form, a series of\ndrawings that suggest what the idea will look like in finished form. Writers with ideas prepare a first\ndraft.\n\f\nNote: Shape up the idea on paper. There are two excellent reasons for this. When the idea takes\ntangible form, you can literally look at it, see the loopholes, see what it needs in the way of \npolish.\nThen, too, ideas have to be “sold” to someone: customers, employees, the boss, friends, fellow club\nmembers, investors. Somebody must “buy” the idea; else it has no value.\nOne summer I was contacted by two life insurance salesmen. Both wanted to work on my\ninsurance program. Both promised to return with a plan for making the needed changes. The first\nsalesman gave me strictly an oral presentation. He told me in words what I needed. But I soon was\nconfused. He brought in taxes, options, Social Security, all the technical details of insurance\nprogramming. Frankly, he lost me and I had to say no.\nThe second salesman used a different approach. He had charted his recommendations. All the\ndetails were shown in diagram form. I could grasp his proposal easily and quickly because I could\nliterally see it. He sold me.\nResolve to put your ideas in salable form. An idea written or in some sort of picture or diagram\nform has many times more selling power than the idea presented only in oral form.\n\f\nUSE THESE TOOLS AND THINK CREATIVELY\n1. Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, your mind will find the ways to\ndo it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.\nEliminate “impossible,” “won’t work,” “can’t do,” “no use trying” from your thinking and\nspeaking vocabularies.\n2. Don’t let tradition paralyze your mind. Be receptive to new ideas. Be experimental. Try new\napproaches. Be progressive in everything you do.\n3. Ask yourself daily, “How can I do better?” There is no limit to self-improvement. When you ask\nyourself, “How can I do better?” sound answers will appear. Try it and see.\n4. Ask yourself, “How can I do more?” Capacity \nis\n a state of mind. Asking yourself this question puts\nyour mind to work to find intelligent shortcuts. The success combination in business is: Do what\nyou do better (improve the quality of your output), and: Do more of what you do (increase the\nquantity of your output).\n5. Practice asking and listening. Ask and listen, and you’ll obtain raw material for reaching sound\ndecisions. Remember: Big people monopolize the \nlistening\n; small people monopolize the \ntalking.\n6. Stretch your mind. Get stimulated. Associate with people who can help you think of new ideas,\nnew ways of doing things. Mix with people of different occupational and social interests.\n\f\n6\n\f\nYOU ARE WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE\nIt’s obvious much human behavior is puzzling. Have you ever wondered why a salesperson will greet\none customer with an alert “Yes sir, may I serve you?” but virtually ignore another? Or why a man\nwill open a door for one woman but not for another? Or why an employee will consistently carry out\nthe instructions of one superior but only grudgingly do what another superior requests? Or why we\nwill pay close attention to what one person says but not to another?\nLook around you. You’ll observe some people receiving the “Hey, Mac” or “Hey, buddy”\ntreatment while others receive the sincere and important “Yes, sir” treatment. Watch. You’ll observe\nthat some people command confidence, loyalty, and admiration while others do not.\nLook closer still, and you’ll also observe that those persons who command the most respect are\nalso the most successful.\nWhat is the explanation? It can be distilled into one word: \nthinking.\n Thinking \ndoes\n make it so.\nOthers see in us what we see in ourselves. We receive the kind of treatment we \nthink\n we deserve.\nThinking \ndoes\n make it so. The fellow who thinks he is inferior, regardless of what his real\nqualifications may be, is inferior. \nFor thinking regulates actions. If a man feels inferior, he acts that\nway, and no veneer of cover-up or bluff will hide this basic feeling for long. The person who feels he\nisn’t important, \nisn’t.\nOn the other side, a fellow who really thinks he is equal to the task, \nis.\nTo be important, we must \nthink\n we are important, \nreally\n think so; then others will think so too.\nHere again is the logic:\nHow you think determines how you act.\nHow you act in turn determines:\n    \nHow others react to you.\nLike other phases of your personal program for success, winning respect is fundamentally simple.\nTo gain the respect of others, you must first think you deserve respect. And the more respect you have\nfor yourself, the more respect others will have for you. Test this principle. Do you have much respect\nfor the fellow on skid row? Of course not. Why? Because the poor fellow doesn’t respect himself.\nHe’s letting himself rot away from lack of self-respect.\nSelf-respect shows through in everything we do. Let’s focus our attention now on some of the\nspecific ways we can increase self-respect and thereby earn more respect from others.\n\f\nLOOK IMPORTANT—IT HELPS YOU THINK IMPORTANT\nRule: Remember, your appearance “talks.” Be sure it says positive things about you. Never leave\nhome without feeling certain you look like the kind of person you want to be.\nThe most honest advertisement ever appearing in print is the “Dress Right. You Can’t Afford Not\nTo!” slogan sponsored by the \nAmerican Institute of Men’s and Boys’ Wear. This slogan deserves to be\nframed in every office, restroom, bedroom, office, and schoolroom in America. In one ad a policeman\nspeaks. He says:\nYou can usually spot a wrong kid just by the way he looks. Sure it’s unfair, but\nit’s a fact: people today judge a youngster by appearance. And once they’ve\ntabbed a boy, it’s tough to change their minds about him, their attitude toward\nhim. Look at your boy. Look at him through his teacher’s eyes, your neighbors’\neyes. Could the way he looks, the clothes he wears, give them the wrong\nimpression? Are you making sure he looks right, dresses right, everywhere he\ngoes?\nThis advertisement, of course, refers primarily to children. But it can be applied to adults as well.\nIn the sentence beginning with \nlook\n, substitute the word \nyourself\n for \nhim, your\n for \nhis, superior’s\n for\nteacher’s\n, and \nassociates’\n for \nneighbors’\n, and reread the sentence. \nLook at yourself through your\nsuperior’s eyes, your associates’ eyes.\nIt costs so little to be neat. Take the slogan literally. Interpret it to say: Dress right; it \nalways\n pays.\nRemember: look important because it helps you to think important.\nUse clothing as a tool to lift your spirits, build confidence. An old psychology professor of mine\nused to give this advice to students on last-minute preparations for final examinations: “Dress up for\nthis important exam. Get a new tie. Have your suit pressed. Shine your shoes. Look sharp because it\nwill help you think sharp.”\nThe professor knew his psychology. Make no mistake about it. Your physical exterior affects your\nmental interior. How you look on the outside affects how you think and feel on the inside.\nAll boys, I’m told, go through the “hat stage.” That is, they use hats to identify themselves with the\nperson or character they want to be. I will always remember a hat incident with my own son, Davey.\nOne day he was dead set on being the Lone Ranger, but he had no Lone Ranger hat.\nI tried to persuade him to substitute another. His protest was “But, Dad, I can’t \nthink\n like the Lone\nRanger without a Lone Ranger hat.”\nI gave in finally and bought him the hat he needed. Sure enough, donning the hat, he \nwas\n the Lone\nRanger.\nI often recall that incident because it says so much about the effect of appearance on thinking.\nAnyone who has ever served in the Army knows a soldier feels and thinks like a soldier when he is in\nuniform. A woman feels more like going to a party when she is dressed for a party.\nBy the same token, an executive feels more like an executive when he is dressed like one. A\nsalesman expressed it to me this way: “I can’t feel prosperous—and I have to if I’m going to make big\nsales—unless I know I look that way.”\nYour appearance talks to you; but it also talks to others. It helps determine what others think of\nyou. In theory, it’s pleasant to hear that people should look at a man’s intellect, not his clothes. But\ndon’t be misled. People do evaluate you on the basis of your appearance. Your appearance is the \nfirst\nbasis for evaluation other people have. And \nfirst\n impressions last, out of all proportion to the time it\n\f\ntakes to form them.\nIn a supermarket one day I noticed one table of seedless grapes marked 15 cents a pound. On\nanother table were what appeared to be identical grapes, this time packaged in polyethylene bags and\nmarked 2 pounds for 35 cents.\nI asked the young fellow at the weighing station, “What’s the difference between the grapes priced\nat 15 cents a pound and those priced at two pounds for 35 cents?”\n“The difference,” he answered, “is polyethylene. We sell about twice as many of the grapes in the\npolyethylene bags. They look better that way.”\nThink about the grape example the next time you’re selling yourself. Properly “packaged,” you\nhave a better chance to make the sale—and at a higher price.\nThe point is: the better you are packaged, the more public acceptance you will receive.\nTomorrow watch who is shown the most respect and courtesy in restaurants, on buses, in crowded\nlobbies, in stores, and at work. People look at another person, make a quick and often subconscious\nappraisal, and then treat him accordingly.\nWe look at some people and respond with the “Hey, Mac” attitude. We look at others and respond\nwith the “Yes, sir” feeling.\nYes, a person’s appearance definitely talks. The well-dressed person’s appearance says positive\nthings. It tells people, “Here is an important person: intelligent, prosperous, and dependable. This\nman can be looked up to, admired, trusted. He respects himself, and I respect him.”\nThe shabby-looking fellow’s appearance says negative things. It says, “Here is a person who isn’t\ndoing well. He’s careless, inefficient, unimportant. He’s just an average person. He deserves no\nspecial consideration. He’s used to being pushed around.”\nWhen I stress “Respect your appearance” in training programs, almost always I am asked the\nquestion “I’m sold. Appearance \nis\n important. But how do you expect me to afford \nthe kind of clothing\nthat really makes me feel right and that causes others to look up to me?”\nThat question puzzles many people. It plagued me for a long time. But the answer is really a\nsimple one: \nPay twice as much and buy half as many.\n Commit this answer to memory. Then practice\nit. Apply it to hats, suits, shoes, socks, coats—everything you wear. Insofar as appearance is\nconcerned, quality is far more important than quantity. When you practice this principle, you’ll find\nthat both your respect for yourself and the respect of others for you will zoom upward. And you’ll\nfind you’re actually ahead money-wise when you pay twice as much and buy half as many because:\n1. Your garments will last more than twice as long because they are more than twice as good, and as a\nrule they will show “quality” as long as they last.\n2. What you buy will stay in style longer. Better clothing always does.\n3. You’ll get better advice. Merchants selling $200 suits are usually much more interested in helping\nyou find the garment that is “just right” for you than are merchants selling $100 suits.\nRemember: Your appearance talks to you and it talks to others. Make certain it says, “Here is a\nperson who has self-respect. He’s important. Treat him that way.”\nYou owe it to others—\nbut, more important, you owe it to yourself\n—to look your best.\nYou are what you think you are. If your appearance makes you think you’re inferior, you \nare\ninferior. If it makes you think small, you are small. Look your best and you will think and act your\n\f\nbest."

    "raw_text": "THINK YOUR WORK IS IMPORTANT\nThere’s a story often told about the job attitudes of three bricklayers. It’s a classic, so let’s go over it\nagain.\nWhen asked, “What are you doing?” the first bricklayer replied, “Laying brick.” The second\nanswered, “Making $9.30 an hour.” And the third said, “Me? Why, I’m building the world’s greatest\ncathedral.”\nNow, the story doesn’t tell us what happened to these bricklayers in later years, but what do you\nthink happened? Chances are that the first two bricklayers remained just that: bricklayers. They\nlacked vision. They lacked job respect. There was nothing behind them to propel them forward to\ngreater success.\nBut you can wager every cent you have the bricklayer who visualized himself as building a great\ncathedral did not remain a bricklayer. Perhaps he became a foreman, or perhaps a contractor, or\npossibly an architect. He moved forward and upward. Why? Because thinking \ndoes\n make it so.\nBricklayer number three was tuned to thought channels that pointed the way to self-development in his\nwork.\nJob thinking tells a lot about a person and his potential for larger responsibility.\nA friend who operates a personnel selection firm said this to me recently: “One thing we always\nlook for in appraising a job applicant for a client is how the applicant thinks about his present job.\nWe are always favorably impressed when we find that an \napplicant thinks his present job is\nimportant, even though there may be something about it he doesn’t like.\n“Why? Simply this: If the applicant feels his present job is important, odds are that he will take\npride in his next job, too. We’ve found an amazingly close correlation between a person’s job respect\nand his job performance.”\nLike your appearance, the way you think toward your work says things about you to your\nsuperiors, associates, and subordinates—in fact, to everyone with whom you come in contact.\nA few months ago I spent several hours with a friend who is personnel director for an appliance\nmanufacturer. We talked about “building men.” He explained his “personnel audit system” and what\nhe had learned from it.\n“We have about eight hundred nonproduction people,” he began. “Under our personnel audit\nsystem, an assistant and I interview each employee every six months. Our purpose is simple. We want\nto learn how we can help him in his job. We think this is a good practice because each person\nworking with us is important, else he wouldn’t be on the payroll.\n“We are careful not to ask the employees any point-blank questions. Instead we encourage him to\ntalk about whatever he wants to. We aim to get his honest impressions. After each interview we fill\nout a rating form on the employee’s attitudes toward specific aspects of his job.\n“Now, here’s something I’ve learned,” he went on. “Our employees fit into one of two categories,\ngroup A and group B, on the basis of how they think toward their jobs.\n“The persons in group B talk mainly about security, company retirement plans, sick leave policy,\nextra time off, what we’re doing to improve the insurance program, and if they will \nbe asked to work\novertime next March as they were last March. They also talk a lot about disagreeable features of their\njob, things they don’t like in fellow workers, and so on. People in group B—and they include close to\n80 percent of all nonproduction personnel—view their jobs as a sort of necessary evil.\n“The group A fellow sees his job through different glasses. He is concerned about his future and\nwants concrete suggestions on what he can do to make faster progress. He doesn’t expect us to give\nhim anything except a chance. The group A people think on a broader scale. They make suggestions\n\f\nfor improving the business. They regard these interviews in my office as constructive. But the group B\npeople often feel our personnel audit system is just a brainwashing affair, and they’re glad to get it\nover with.\n“Now, there’s a way I check attitudes and what they mean to job success. All recommendations\nfor promotions, pay increases, and special privileges are channeled to me by the employee’s\nimmediate supervisor. Almost invariably, it’s a group A person who was recommended. And again\nalmost without exception, problems come from the group B category.\n“The biggest challenge in my job,” he said, “is to try and help people move from group B to group\nA. It’s not easy, though, because until a person thinks his job is important and thinks positively about\nit, he can’t be helped.”\nThis is concrete evidence that you are what you think you are, what your thought power directs\nyou to become. Think you’re weak, think you lack what it takes, think you will lose, think you are\nsecond-class—think this way, and you are doomed to mediocrity.\nBut think instead, \nI am important. I do have what it takes. I am a first-class performer. My work\nis important.\n Think this way, and you’re headed straight to success.\nThe key to winning what you want lies in thinking positively toward yourself. The only real basis\nother people have for judging your abilities is your actions. And your actions are controlled by your\nthoughts.\nYou \nare\n what you \nthink\n you are.\nWear the shoes of a supervisor for a few moments and ask yourself which person you would\nrecommend for a raise or a promotion:\n1. The secretary who, when the executive is out of the office, spends her time reading magazines or\nthe secretary who uses such time to do the many little things that help the executive to accomplish\nmore when he returns?\n2. The employee who says, “Oh well, I can always get another job. If they don’t like the way I do my\nwork, I’ll just quit” or the employee who views criticism constructively and sincerely tries to do\nhigher-quality work?\n3. The salesman who tells a customer, “Oh, I just do what they tell me to do. They said come out and\nsee if you need anything” or the salesman who says, “Mr. Brown, I’m here to help you”?\n4. The foreman who says to an employee, “To tell you the truth, I don’t like my job much. Those guys\nup top give me \na pain in the neck. I don’t know what they’re talking about half the time” or the\nsupervisor who says, “You’ve got to expect some unpleasantness on any job. But let me assure you,\nthe men in the front office are on the ball. They’ll do right by us”?\nIsn’t it obvious why many people stay at one level all their lives? Their thinking alone keeps them\nthere.\nAn advertising executive once told me about his agency’s informal training to “break in” new,\ninexperienced men.\n“As company policy,” he said, “we feel the best initial training is to start the young fellow, who,\nincidentally, is usually a college graduate, as a mail boy. We don’t do this, of course, because we feel\na fellow needs four years of college to take mail from one office to another. Our purpose is to give the\n\f\nnew fellow maximum exposure to the many varied things which must be done in agency work. After\nhe knows his way around, we give him an assignment.\n“Now, occasionally, even after we’ve carefully explained why we’re starting him out in the mail\nroom, a young fellow feels that carrying the mail is belittling and unimportant. When this is the case,\nwe know we’ve picked the wrong man. If he doesn’t have the vision to see that being a mail boy is a\nnecessary, practical step to important assignments, then he has no future in the agency business.”\nRemember, executives answer the question \nWhat would he do on that specific level?\n by first\nanswering the question \nWhat kind of job is he doing where he is now?\nHere is some logic, sound, straight, and easy. Read it at least five times before you go on:\nA person who\n thinks \nhis job is important\nReceives mental signals on how to do his job better\n;\nAnd a better job means\nMore promotions, more money, more prestige, more happiness.\nWe’ve all noticed how children quickly pick up the attitudes, habits, fears, and preferences of\ntheir parents. Whether it be food preferences, mannerisms, religious and political views, or any other\ntype of behavior, the child is a living reflection of how his parents or guardians think; for he learns\nthrough imitation.\nAnd so do adults! People continue to imitate others throughout life. And they imitate their leaders\nand supervisors; their thoughts and actions are influenced by these people.\nYou can check this easily. Study one of your friends and the person he works for, and note the\nsimilarities in thinking and action.\nHere are some of the ways your friend may imitate his boss or other associate: slang and word\nchoice, the way he smokes cigarettes, some facial expressions and mannerisms, choice of clothing,\nand automobile preferences. There are many, many more, of course.\nAnother way to note the power of imitation is to observe the attitudes of employees and compare\nthem with those of the “chief.” When the chief is nervous, tense, worried, his close associates reflect\nsimilar attitudes. But when Mr. Chief is on top, feeling good, so are his employees.\nThe point is this: \nThe way we think toward our jobs determines how our subordinates think\ntoward their jobs.\nThe job attitudes of our subordinates are direct reflections of our own job attitudes. It’s well to\nremember that our points of superiority—and weakness—show up in the behavior of those who\nreport to us, just as a child reflects the attitudes of his parents.\n*\nConsider just one characteristic of successful people: enthusiasm. Ever notice how an enthusiastic\nsalesperson in a department store gets you, the customer, more excited about the merchandise? Or\nhave you observed how an enthusiastic minister or other speaker has a wide-awake, alert,\nenthusiastic audience? If you have enthusiasm, those around you will have it, too.\nBut how does one develop enthusiasm? The basic step is simple: Think enthusiastically. Build in\nyourself an optimistic, progressive glow, a feeling that “this is great and I’m 100 percent for it.”\nYou are what you think. Think enthusiasm and you’ll be enthusiastic. To get high-quality work, be\nenthusiastic about the job you want done. Others will catch the enthusiasm you generate and you’ll get\n\f\nfirst-class performance.\nBut if, in negative fashion, you “cheat” that company on expense money, supplies, and time, and in\nother little ways, then what can you expect your subordinates to do? Habitually arrive late and leave\nearly, and what do you think the “troops” will do?\nAnd there is a major incentive for us to think right about our jobs so that our subordinates will\nthink right about their jobs. Our superiors evaluate us by measuring the quality and quantity of output\nwe get from those reporting to us.\nLook at it this way: whom would you elevate to division \nsales manager—the branch sales\nmanager whose salesmen are doing superior work or the branch sales manager whose salesmen\ndeliver only average performance? Or whom would you recommend for promotion to production\nmanager—the supervisor whose department meets its quota or the supervisor whose department lags\nbehind?\nHere are two suggestions for getting others to do more for you:\n1. Always show positive attitudes toward your job so that your subordinates will “pick up” right\nthinking.\n2. As you approach your job each day, ask yourself, “Am I worthy in every respect of being imitated?\nAre all my habits such that I would be glad to see them in my subordinates?”\n\f\nGIVE YOURSELF A PEP TALK SEVERAL TIMES DAILY\nSeveral months ago an automobile salesman told me about the success-producing technique he’s\ndeveloped. It makes sense. Read it.\n“A big part of my job, for two hours a day,” the salesman explained, “is telephoning prospects to\narrange demonstration appointments. When I first started selling cars three years ago, this was my big\nproblem. I was shy and afraid, and I know my voice sounded that way on the phone. It was easy for\npeople I called to say, ‘I’m not interested,’ and hang up.\n“Every Monday morning back then our sales manager held a sales meeting. It was a pretty\ninspirational affair, and it made \nme feel good. And what’s more, I always seemed to arrange more\ndemonstrations on Monday than on any other day. But the trouble was that little of Monday’s\ninspiration carried over to Tuesday and the rest of the week.\n“Then I got an idea. If the sales manager can pep me up, why can’t I pep myself up? Why not give\nmyself a pep talk just before I start making those phone calls? That day I decided to try it. Without\ntelling anyone I walked out on the lot and found a vacant car. Then for several minutes I talked to\nmyself. I told myself, ‘I’m a good car salesman and I’m going to be the best. I sell good cars and I\ngive good deals. The people I’m phoning need those cars and I’m going to sell them.’\n“Well, from the very beginning this self-supercharging paid off. I felt so good I didn’t dread\nmaking those calls. I \nwanted\n to make them. I no longer go out on the lot and sit in a car to give myself\na pep talk. But I still use the technique. Before I dial a number I silently remind myself that I’m a top-\nnotch salesman and I’m going to get results, and I do.”\nThat’s a pretty good idea, isn’t it? To be on top, you’ve got to feel like you’re on top. Give\nyourself a pep talk and discover how much bigger and stronger you feel.\nRecently, in a training program I conducted, each person was asked to give a ten-minute talk on\n“being a leader.” One of the trainees gave a miserable presentation. His knees literally shook and his\nhands trembled. He forgot what he was going to say. After fumbling for five or six minutes, he sat\ndown, thoroughly defeated.\nAfter the session, I spoke to him just long enough to ask him to be there fifteen minutes early at the\nnext session.\nAs promised, he was there fifteen minutes ahead of time for the next session. The two of us sat\ndown to discuss his talk of \nthe night before. I asked him to remember as clearly as he could exactly\nwhat he had thought about the five minutes just before he gave his talk.\n“Well, I guess all I thought about was how scared I was. I knew I was going to make a fool of\nmyself. I knew I was going to be a flop. I kept thinking, ‘Who am I to be talking about being a leader?’\nI tried to remember what I was going to say, but all I could think about was failing.”\n“Right there,” I injected, “is the answer to your problem. Before you got up to talk you gave\nyourself a terrible mental beating. You convinced yourself that you would fail. Is it any wonder your\ntalk didn’t come off well? Instead of developing courage, you developed fear.\n“Now, this evening’s session,” I continued, “starts in just four minutes. Here’s what I’d like you to\ndo. Give yourself a pep talk for the next few minutes. Go in that vacant room across the hall and tell\nyourself, ‘I’m going to give a great talk. I’ve got something those people need to hear and I want to\nsay.’ Keep repeating those sentences forcefully, with complete conviction. Then come into the\nconference room and give your talk again.”\nI wish you could have been there to hear the difference. That brief, self-administered, hard-hitting\npep talk helped him to make a splendid speech.\nThe moral: Practice uplifting self-praise. Don’t practice belittling self-punishment."

    "raw_text": "You are what you think you are. Think more of yourself and there is more of you.\n*\nBuild your own “sell-yourself-to-yourself” commercial. Think for a moment about one of America’s\nmost popular products, \nCoca-Cola. Every day your eyes or ears come in contact many times with the\ngood news about Coke. The people who make Coca-Cola are continually reselling you on Coke, and\nfor a good reason. If they stopped reselling you, chances are you’d grow lukewarm and eventually\ncold to Coke. Then sales would drop.\nBut the Coca-Cola Company isn’t going to let this happen. They resell you and resell you and\nresell you on Coke.\nEvery day you and I see half-alive people who are no longer sold on themselves. They lack self-\nrespect for their most important product—themselves. These folks are indifferent. They feel small.\nThey feel like nobodies, and because they feel that way, that’s what they are.\nThe half-alive person needs to be resold on himself. He needs to realize that he’s a first-class\nperson. He needs honest, sincere belief in himself.\nTom Staley is a young fellow who is going places—and fast. Tom regularly resells himself on\nhimself three times every day with what he calls “Tom Staley’s 60-Second Commercial.” He carries\nhis personalized commercial in his billfold at all times. Here is exactly what it says:\nTom Staley, meet Tom Staley—an important, a\n really \nimportant person. Tom, you’re a big\nthinker, so think big. Think\n Big \nabout\n Everything. \nYou’ve got plenty of ability to do a\nfirst-class job, so\n do \na first-class job.\nTom, you believe in Happiness, Progress, and Prosperity.\nSo: talk only Happiness\n,\ntalk only Progress\n,\ntalk only Prosperity.\nYou have lots of drive, Tom, lots of drive.\nSo put that drive to work. Nothing can stop you, Tom, nothing.\nTom, you’re enthusiastic. Let your enthusiasm show through.\nYou look good, Tom, and you feel good. Stay that way.\nTom Staley, you were a great fellow yesterday and you’re going to be an even greater\nfellow today. Now go to it, Tom. Go forward.\nTom credits his commercial with helping him become a more successful, dynamic person.\n“Before I started selling myself to myself,” says Tom, “I thought I was inferior to just about anybody\nand everybody. Now I realize that I’ve got what it takes to win and I’m winning. And I’m always\ngoing to win.”\nHere’s how to build your “sell-yourself-to-yourself” commercial.\n First, select your assets, your\npoints of superiority. Ask yourself, “What are my best qualities?” Don’t be shy in describing yourself.\nNext, put these points down on paper in your own words. Write your commercial to you. Reread\nTom Staley’s commercial. Notice how he talks to Tom. Talk to yourself. Be very direct. Don’t think of\nanyone but \nyou\n as you say your commercial.\nThird, practice your commercial \nout loud\n in private at least once a day. It helps a lot to do this\nbefore a mirror. Put your body into it. Repeat your commercial forcefully with determination. Make\n\f\nyour blood travel faster through your body. Get yourself warmed up.\nFourth, read your commercial silently several times every day. Read it before you tackle anything\nthat demands courage. Read it every time you feel let down. Keep your commercial handy at all times\n—then use it.\nJust one thing more. A lot of people, maybe even a majority, may “ho ho” at this success-\nrewarding technique. That’s because they refuse to believe that success comes from managed thinking.\nBut please! Don’t accept the judgment of average people. You are \nnot\n average. If you have any doubts\nas to the basic soundness of the “sell-yourself-to-yourself” principle, ask the most successful person\nyou know what he thinks about it. Ask him, and then start selling yourself to yourself.\n\f\nUPGRADE YOUR THINKING. THINK LIKE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THINK\nUpgrading your thinking upgrades your actions, and this produces success. Here is an easy way to\nhelp you make more of yourself by thinking like important people think. Use the form below as a\nguide.\n\f\nHOW AM I THINKING? CHECKLIST\nSITUATION\nASK YOURSELF\n1. When I worry\nWould an important person worry about this?\n \nWould the most successful person I know be\ndisturbed about this?\n2. An idea\nWhat would an important person do if he had this\nidea?\n3. My appearance\nDo I look like someone who has maximum self-\nrespect?\n4. My language\nAm I using the language of successful people?\n5. What I read\nWould an important person read this?\n6. Conversation\nIs this something successful people would\ndiscuss?\n7. When I lose my temper\nWould an important person get mad at what I’m\nmad at?\n8. My jokes\nIs this the kind of joke an important person would\ntell?\n9. My job\nHow does an important person describe his job\nto others?\nCement in your mind the question “Is this the way an important person does it?” Use this question\nto make you a bigger, more successful person.\nIn a nutshell, remember\n:\n1. Look important; it helps you think important. Your appearance talks to you. Be sure it lifts your\nspirits and builds your confidence. Your appearance talks to others. Make certain it says, “Here is\nan important person: intelligent, prosperous, and dependable.”\n2. Think your work is important. Think this way, and you will receive mental signals on how to do\nyour job better. Think your work is important, and your subordinates will think their work is\nimportant too.\n3. Give yourself a pep talk several times daily. Build a “sell-yourself-to-yourself” commercial.\nRemind yourself at every opportunity that you’re a first-class person.\n4. In all of life’s situations, ask yourself, “Is this the way an important person thinks?” Then obey the\nanswer.\n\f\n7\n\f\nMANAGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT: GO\nFIRST CLASS\nYour mind is an amazing mechanism. When your mind works one way, it can carry you forward to\noutstanding success. But the same mind operating in a different manner can produce a total failure.\nThe mind is the most delicate, most sensitive instrument in all creation. Let’s look now and see\nwhat makes the mind think the way it does. Millions of people are diet conscious. We’re a calorie-\ncounting nation. We spend millions of dollars on vitamins, minerals, and other dietary supplements.\nAnd we all know why. Through nutritional research, we’ve learned that the body reflects the diet fed\nthe body. Physical stamina, resistance to disease, body size, even how long we live are all closely\nrelated to what we eat.\nThe body is what the body is fed. By the same token, the mind is what the mind is fed. Mind food,\nof course, doesn’t come in packages, and you can’t buy it at the store. Mind food is your environment\n—all the countless things that influence your conscious and subconscious thought. The kind of mind\nfood we consume determines our habits, attitudes, personality. Each of us inherited a certain capacity\nto develop. But how much of that \ncapacity we have developed and the way we have developed that\ncapacity depends on the kind of mind food we feed it.\nThe mind reflects what its environment feeds it just as surely as the body reflects the food you\nfeed it.\nHave you ever thought what kind of person you would be had you been reared in some foreign\ncountry instead of the United States? What kinds of foods would you prefer? Would your preferences\nfor clothing be the same? What sort of entertainment would you like the most? What kind of work\nwould you be doing? What would your religion be?\nYou can’t, of course, be sure of the answers to these questions. But chances are you would be a\nmaterially different person had you grown up in a different country. Why? Because you would have\nbeen influenced by a different environment. As the saying goes, you are a product of your\nenvironment.\nMark it well. Environment shapes us, makes us think the way we do. Try to name just one habit or\none mannerism you have that you did not pick up from other people. Relatively minor things, like the\nway we walk, cough, hold a cup; our preferences for music, literature, entertainment, clothing—all\nstem in very large part from environment.\nMore important, the size of your thinking, your goals, your attitudes, your very personality is\nformed by your environment.\nProlonged association with negative people makes us think negatively; close contact with petty\nindividuals develops petty habits in us. On the bright side, companionship with people with big ideas\nraises the level of our thinking; close contact with ambitious people gives us ambition.\nExperts agree that the person you are \ntoday\n, your personality, ambitions, present status in life, are\nlargely the result of \nyour psychological environment. And experts agree also that the person you \nwill\n\f\nbe\n one, five, ten, twenty years from now depends almost entirely on your future environment.\nYou will change over the months and years. This we know. But \nhow\n you will change depends on\nyour future environment, the mind food you feed yourself. Let’s look now at what we can do to make\nour future environment pay off in satisfaction and prosperity.\n\f\nRECONDITION YOURSELF FOR SUCCESS\nThe number one obstacle on the road to high-level success is the feeling that major accomplishment is\nbeyond reach. This attitude stems from many, many suppressive forces that direct our thinking toward\nmediocre levels.\nTo understand these suppressive forces, let’s go back to the time we were children. As children,\nall of us set high goals. At a surprisingly young age we made plans to conquer the unknown, to be\nleaders, to attain positions of high importance, to do exciting and stimulating things, to become\nwealthy and famous—in short, to be first, biggest, and best. And in our blessed ignorance we saw our\nway clear to accomplish these goals.\nBut what happened? Long before we reached the age when we could begin to work toward our\ngreat objectives, a multitude of suppressive influences went to work.\nFrom all sides we heard “It’s foolish to be a dreamer” and that our ideas were “impractical,\nstupid, naive, or foolish,” that you have “got to have money to go places,” that “luck determines who\ngets ahead or you’ve got to have important friends,” or you’re “too old or too young.”\nAs a result of being bombarded with the “you-can’t-get-ahead-so-don’t-bother-to-try”\npropaganda, most people you know can be classified into three groups:\nFirst group: Those who surrendered completely.\n The majority of people are convinced deep down\ninside that they haven’t got what it takes, that real success, real accomplishment, is for others who are\nlucky or fortunate in some special respect. You can easily spot these people because they go to great\nlengths to rationalize their status and explain how “happy” they really are.\nA very intelligent man, age thirty-two, who has dead-ended himself in a safe but mediocre\nposition, recently spent hours telling me why he was so satisfied with his job. He did a good job of\nrationalizing, but he was only kidding himself and he knew it. What he really wanted was to work in a\nchallenging situation where he could grow and develop. But that “multitude of suppressive\ninfluences” had convinced him that he was inadequate for big things.\nThis group is, in reality, just the other extreme of the discontented job switcher searching for\nopportunity. Rationalizing yourself into a rut, which incidentally has been described as a grave with\nboth ends open, can be as bad as wandering aimlessly, hoping opportunity will somehow, someday hit\nyou in the face.\nSecond group: Those who surrendered partially.\n A second but much smaller group enters adult life\nwith considerable hope for success. These people prepare themselves. They work. They plan. But,\nafter a decade or so, resistance begins to build up, competition for top-level jobs looks rugged. This\ngroup then decides that greater success is not worth the effort.\nThey rationalize, “We’re earning more than the average and we live better than the average. Why\nshould we knock ourselves out?”\nActually, this group has developed a set of fears: fear of failure, fear of social disapproval, fear\nof insecurity, fear of losing what they already have. These people aren’t satisfied because deep down\nthey know they have surrendered. This group includes many talented, intelligent people who elect to\ncrawl through life because they are afraid to stand up and run.\nThird group: Those who never surrender.\n This group, maybe 2 or 3 percent of the total, doesn’t let\npessimism dictate, doesn’t believe in surrendering to suppressive forces, doesn’t believe in crawling.\nInstead, these people live and breathe success. This group is the happiest because it accomplishes the\n\f\nmost. These people become top salesmen, top executives, top leaders in their respective fields. These\npeople find life stimulating, rewarding, worthwhile. These people look forward to each new day,\neach new encounter with other people, as adventures to be lived fully.\nLet’s be honest. All of us would like to be in the third group, the one that finds greater success\neach year, the one that does things and gets results.\nTo get—and stay—in this group, however, we must fight off the suppressive influences of our\nenvironment. To understand how persons in the first and second groups will unwittingly try to hold\nyou back, study this example.\nSuppose you tell several of your “average” friends, with the greatest sincerity: “Someday I’m\ngoing to be vice president of this company.”\nWhat will happen? Your friends will probably think you are joking. And if they should believe\nyou mean it, chances are they will say, “You poor guy, you sure have a lot to learn.”\nBehind your back they may even question whether you have all your marbles.\nNow, assume you repeat the same statement with equal sincerity to the president of your company.\nHow will he react? One thing is certain: he will \nnot\n laugh. He will look at you intently and ask\nhimself: “Does this fellow really mean this?”\nBut he will not, we repeat, laugh.\nBecause big men do not laugh at big ideas.\nOr suppose you tell some average people you plan to own an expensive home, and they may laugh\nat you because they think it’s impossible. But tell your plan to a person already living in an expensive\nhome, and he won’t be surprised. He knows it isn’t impossible, because he’s already done it.\nRemember: \nPeople who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people, are\nstrictly average or mediocre at best in terms of accomplishment.\n The opinions of these people can\nbe poison.\nDevelop a defense against people who want to convince you that you can’t do it. Accept negative\nadvice only as a challenge to prove that you \ncan\n do it.\n*\nBe extra, extra cautious about this: don’t let negative-thinking people—“negators”—destroy your plan\nto think yourself to success. Negators are everywhere, and they seem to delight in sabotaging the\npositive progress of others.\nDuring college I buddied for a couple of semesters with W. W. He was a fine friend, the kind of\nfellow who would loan you a little money when you were short or help you in many \nlittle ways.\nDespite this fine loyalty, W. W. was just about 100 percent sour and bitter toward life, the future,\nopportunity. He was a real negator.\nDuring that period I was an enthusiastic reader of a certain newspaper columnist who stressed\nhope, the positive approach, opportunity. When W. W. would find me reading this columnist, or when\nher column was mentioned, he’d swing verbally and say, “Oh, for Pete’s sake, Dave. Read the front\npage. That’s where you learn about life. You ought to know that columnist is just making a quick buck\ndishing out sweet sauce for the weak.”\nWhen our discussions turned to getting ahead in life, W. W. was right there with his moneymaking\nformula. In his own words, it went like this: “Dave, there are just three ways to make money these\ndays. One, marry a rich woman; two, steal in a nice, clean, legal way; or three, get to know the right\npeople, somebody with plenty of pull.”\n\f\nW. W. was always prepared to defend his formula with examples. Sticking to the front page, he\nwas quick to cite that one labor leader in a thousand who had siphoned off a pile of money from the\nunion till and got away with it. He kept his eyes open for that rare, rare marriage of the fruit picker to\nMiss Millionaire. And he knew a fellow who knew a fellow who knew a big man and got cut in on a\nbig deal that made him rich.\nW. W. was several years older than I, and he made excellent grades in his engineering classes. I\nlooked up to him in a younger-brother sort of way. I came dangerously close to ditching my basic\nconvictions about what it takes to be a success and accepting the negators’ philosophy.\nFortunately, one evening after a long discussion with W. W. I grabbed hold of myself. It dawned\non me that I was listening \nto the voice of failure. It seemed to me W. W. was talking more to convince\nhimself than he was to convert me to his way of thinking. From then on I regarded W. W. as an object\nlesson, a sort of experimental guinea pig. Rather than buy what he said, I studied him, trying to figure\nout why he thought the way he did and where such thinking would take him. I turned my negator friend\ninto a personal experiment.\nI haven’t seen W. W. in eleven years. But a mutual friend saw him just a few months ago. W. W. is\nworking as a low-paid draftsman in Washington. I asked my friend whether W. W. has changed.\n“No, except if anything he’s more negative than when we knew him. He’s having a tough go of it.\nHe has four children, and on his income it’s rough. Old W. W. has the brains to be making five times\nwhat he is if he just knew how to use those brains.”\nNegators are everywhere. Some negators, like the one who almost tripped me, are well-meaning\nfolks. But others are jealous people who, not moving ahead themselves, want you to stumble too.\nThey feel inadequate themselves, so they want to make a mediocre person out of you.\nBe extra careful. Study negators. Don’t let them destroy your plans for success.\nA young office worker recently explained to me why he had changed car pools. “One fellow,” he\nsaid, “talked about nothing trip in and trip out except what an awful company we worked for.\nRegardless of what management did, he found fault. He was negative about everyone from his\nsupervisor on up. The products we sold were no good. Every policy had something wrong with it. As\nhe saw it, absolutely everything had something wrong with it.\n“Each morning I arrived at work tense and wound up tight. And each night, after hearing him\npreach and rant for forty-five \nminutes about all the things that went wrong that day, I got home\ndiscouraged and depressed. Finally, I got sense enough to get in another car pool. It’s made a world\nof difference, for now I’m with a group of fellows who can see two sides to a question.”\nThat young fellow changed his environment. Smart, wasn’t he?\nMake no mistake about it. You \nare\n judged by the company you keep. Birds of a feather \ndo\n flock\ntogether. Fellow workers are not all alike. Some are negative, others positive. Some work because\nthey “have to”; others are ambitious and work for advancement. Some associates belittle everything\nthe boss says or does; others are much more objective and realize they must be good followers before\nthey can be good leaders.\nHow we think is directly affected by the group we’re in. \nBe sure you’re in the flock that thinks\nright.\nThere are pitfalls to watch in your work environment. In every group there are persons who,\nsecretly aware of their own inadequacies, want to stand in your way and prevent you from making\nprogress. Many ambitious fellows have been laughed at, even threatened, because they tried to be\nmore efficient and produce more. Let’s face it. Some folks, being jealous, want to make you feel\nembarrassed because you want to move upward.\n\f\nThis often happens in factories, where fellow workers sometimes resent the fellow who wants to\nspeed up production. It happens in the military service when a clique of negative-minded individuals\npoke fun at and try to humiliate the young soldier who wants to go to officers’ school.\nIt happens in business, too, when a few individuals not qualified to advance try to block the way\nfor someone else.\nYou’ve seen it happen time and again in high schools when a group of lunkheads deride a\nclassmate who has the good sense to make the most of his educational opportunities and come out\nwith high grades. Sometimes—and all too sadly often—the bright student is jeered at until he reaches\nthe conclusion that it isn’t smart to be intelligent.\nIgnore such negative thinkers in your midst.\nFor often the remarks made in your direction aren’t so personal as you might at first think. They\nare merely a projection of the speaker’s own feeling of failure and discouragement.\nDon’t let negative thinkers pull you down to their level. Let them slide by, like the water from the\nproverbial duck’s back. Cling to people who think progressively. Move upward with \nthem.\nYou can do it, simply by thinking right!\nA special word of caution: be careful about your source of advice. In most organizations you will\nencounter freelance advisors who “know the ropes” and are tremendously eager to clue you in. One\ntime I overheard a freelance advisor explaining the facts of office life to a bright young man just\nstarting in. Said the advisor: “The best way to get along here is just stay out of everybody’s way. If\nthey ever get to know you, all they’ll do is pile more work on you. Be especially careful to stay away\nfrom Mr. Z. [the department manager]. If he thinks you haven’t got enough to do, he’ll really load you\ndown . . .”\nThis freelance advisor had been with the company for almost thirty years and was still bottom\nman on the totem pole. What a consultant for a young fellow who wants to move upward in the\nbusiness!\n\f\nMAKE IT A RULE TO SEEK ADVICE FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW\nThere’s a lot of incorrect thinking that successful people are inaccessible. The plain truth is that they\nare \nnot.\n As a rule, it’s the more successful people who are the most humble and ready to help. Since\nthey are sincerely interested in their work and success, they are eager to see that the work lives on\nand that somebody capable succeeds them when they retire. It’s the “would-be-big” people who are\nmost often the most abrupt and hard to get to know.\nAn executive made this clear: “I’m a busy woman, but there’s no Do Not Disturb sign on my\noffice door. Counseling people is one of my key functions. We give standardized training of one kind\nor another to everybody in the company. But personal counseling, or ‘tutoring,’ as I like to call it, is\navailable for the asking.\n“I stand ready to help the fellow who comes in here with either a company or a personal problem.\nThe fellow who displays curiosity and exhibits a real desire to know more about his job and how it\nrelates to other jobs is the individual I like most to help.\n“But,” she said, “for obvious reasons, I can’t spend time offering advice to anybody who isn’t\nsincere in seeking it.”\nGo first class\n when you have questions. Seeking advice from a failure is like consulting a quack\non how to cure cancer.\n*\nMany executives today never employ persons for key jobs without first interviewing the fellow’s\nwife. One sales executive explained to me, “I want to be sure the prospective salesman has his family\nbehind him, a cooperative family that won’t object to \ntravel, irregular hours, and other\ninconveniences which are part of selling, a family that will help the salesman over those inevitable\nrough spots.”\nExecutives today realize that what happens on weekends and between 6 \nP.M.\n and 9 \nA.M.\n directly\naffects a person’s performance from 9 \nA.M.\n to 6 \nP.M.\n The person with a constructive off-the-job life\nnearly always is more successful than the person who lives in a dull, dreary home situation.\nLet’s look in on the traditional way two co-workers, John and Milton, spend their weekends. Let’s\nlook, too, at the ultimate results.\nJohn’s psychological diet on weekends is something like this: Usually, one evening is spent with\nsome carefully selected, interesting friends. Another evening is generally spent out: perhaps at a\nmovie, a civic or community project, or some friends’ house. John devotes Saturday morning to Boy\nScout work. Saturday afternoon he does errands and chores around the house. Often he works on\nsome special project. Currently it’s building a patio in the backyard. On Sundays John and his family\ndo something special. One Sunday recently they climbed a mountain; another Sunday they visited a\nmuseum. Occasionally they drive into the nearby countryside, for John wants to buy some country\nproperty in the not-too-distant future.\nSunday evening is spent quietly. John usually reads a book and catches up on the news.\nWrapped up, John’s weekends are planned. His many refreshing activities keep boredom locked\nout. John gets plenty of psychological sunshine.\nMilton’s psychological diet is much less well balanced than John’s. His weekends are unplanned.\nMilton is usually pretty \n“tired” on Friday night, but he goes through the motions of asking his wife,\n“Want to do anything tonight?” but the plan dies there. Rarely do Milton and his wife entertain, and\nrarely are they invited out. Milton sleeps late on Saturday morning, and the rest of the day is taken up\n\f\nwith chores of one kind or another. Saturday night Milton and his family usually go to a movie or\nwatch TV (“What else is there to do?”). Milton spends most of Sunday morning in bed. Sunday\nafternoon they drive over to Bill and Mary’s or Bill and Mary drive over to see them. (Bill and Mary\nare the only couple Milton and his wife visit regularly.)\nMilton’s entire weekend is marked by boredom. By the time Sunday evening rolls around, the\nwhole family is on each other’s nerves as a result of “cabin fever.” There are no knock-down, drag-\nout fights, but there are hours of psychological warfare.\nMilton’s weekend is dull, dreary, boring. Milton gets no psychological sunshine.\nNow, what’s the effect of these two home environments on John and Milton? Over a period of a\nweek or two there probably is no perceptible effect. But over a period of months and years the effect\nis tremendous.\nJohn’s environmental pattern leaves him refreshed, gives him ideas, tunes up his thinking. He’s\nlike an athlete being fed steak.\nMilton’s environmental pattern leaves him psychologically starved. His thinking mechanism is\nimpaired. He’s like an athlete being fed candy and beer.\nJohn and Milton may be on the same level today, but there will gradually be a wide gap between\nthem in the months ahead, with John in the lead position.\nCasual observers will say, “Well, I guess John has more on the ball than Milton.”\nBut those of us who know will explain that much of the difference in job performance is the result\nof the difference in the mind food consumed by the two fellows.\nEvery farmer in the corn belt knows that if he puts plenty of fertilizer with his corn, he’s going to\nget a bigger yield. Thinking too must be given additional nourishment if we want to get better results.\nMy wife and I, along with five other couples, spent a wonderful evening last month as guests of a\ndepartment store executive and his wife. My wife and I lingered just a little longer than the others, so\nI had a chance to ask our host, whom I know well, a question that had been in my mind all evening.\n“This was really a wonderful evening,” I said, “but I’m puzzled about one thing. I’d expected to meet\nmainly other retailing executives here tonight. But your guests all represented different fields. There\nwas a writer, a doctor, an engineer, an accountant, and a teacher.”\nHe smiled and said, “Well, we often do entertain retailing people. But Helen and I find it’s very\nrefreshing to mix with people who do something else for a living. I’m afraid if we confined our\nentertaining to people who have only interests similar to our own, we’d find ourselves in the old,\nwell-known rut.\n“Besides,” he went on, “people are my business. Every day thousands of people of every\noccupational group imaginable visit our store. The more I can learn about other people—their ideas,\ninterests, viewpoints—the better job I can do in giving them the merchandise and service they want\nand will buy.”\nHere are a few simple “do’s” to help make your social environment first class:\n1. Do circulate in new groups. Restricting your social environment to the same small group produces\nboredom, dullness, dissatisfaction; equally important, remember that your success-building\nprogram requires that you become an expert in understanding people. Trying to learn all there is to\nknow about people by studying one small group is like trying to master mathematics by reading one\nshort book.\nMake new friends, join new organizations, enlarge your social orbit. Then too, variety in\npeople, like variety in anything else, adds spice to life and gives it a broader dimension. It’s good\n\f\nmind food.\n2. Do select friends who have views different from your own. In this modern age, the narrow\nindividual hasn’t much future. Responsibility and positions of importance gravitate to the person\nwho is able to see both sides. If you’re a Republican, make sure you have some friends who are\nDemocrats, and vice versa. Get to know people of different religious faiths. Associate with\nopposites. But just be sure they are persons with real potential.\n3. Do select friends who stand above petty, unimportant things. Folks who are more concerned with\nthe square footage of your home or the appliances you have or don’t have than with your ideas and\nyour conversation are inclined to be petty. Guard your psychological environment. Select friends\nwho are interested in positive things, friends who really \ndo\n want to see you succeed. Find friends\nwho breathe encouragement into your plans and ideals. If you don’t, if \nyou select petty thinkers as\nyour close friends, you’ll gradually develop into a petty thinker yourself.\nWe’re a poison-conscious nation—body poison, that is.\nEvery restaurateur is on guard against food poisoning. Just a couple of cases of it, and his patrons\nwon’t come near his place. We’ve got tons of laws to protect the public against hundreds of body\npoisons. We put—or should put—poisons on the top shelves so the kids can’t reach them. We go to\nany extreme to avoid body poison. And it’s good that we do.\nBut there’s another type of poison perhaps a little more insidious—thought poison—commonly\ncalled “gossip.” Thought poison differs from body poison in two ways. It affects the mind, not the\nbody, and is more subtle. The person being poisoned usually doesn’t know it.\nThought poison is subtle, but it accomplishes “big” things. It reduces the size of our thinking by\nforcing us to concentrate on petty, unimportant things. It warps and twists our thinking about people\nbecause it is based on a distortion of facts, and it creates a guilt feeling in us that shows through when\nwe meet the person we’ve gossiped about. Thought poison is 0 percent \nright\n thinking: it is 100\npercent \nwrong\n thinking.\nAnd contrary to lots of opinion, women have no exclusive franchise on gossip. Every day many\nmen, too, live in a partially poisoned environment. Every day thousands of gossip fests staged by men\ntake place on such topics as “the boss’s marital or financial problems”; “Bill’s politicking to get\nahead in business”; “the probability of John being transferred”; “the reasons for special favors being\nawarded Tom”; and “why they brought in that new man.” Gossiping goes something like this: “Say, I\njust \nheard . . . no, why . . . well, it doesn’t surprise me . . . he had it coming to him . . . of course, this\nis confidential . . .”\nConversation is a big part of our psychological environment. Some conversation is healthy. It\nencourages you. It makes you feel like you’re taking a walk in the warm sunshine of a spring day.\nSome conversation makes you feel like a winner.\nBut other conversation is more like walking through a poisonous, radioactive cloud. It chokes\nyou. It makes you feel ill. It turns you into a loser.\nGossip is just negative conversation about people, and the victim of thought poison begins to think\nhe enjoys it. He seems to get a form of poisoned joy from talking negatively about others, not knowing\nthat to successful people he is becoming increasingly unlikable, and unreliable.\nOne of these thought-poison addicts walked into a conversation some friends and I were having\n\f\nabout Benjamin Franklin. As soon as Mr. Killjoy learned the topic of our chat, he came through with\nchoice bits about Franklin’s personal life, in a negative way. Perhaps it’s true that Franklin was a\ncharacter in some ways and he might have made the scandal magazines had they been around in the\neighteenth century. But the point is, Benjamin Franklin’s personal life had no bearing on the\ndiscussion at hand, and I couldn’t help being glad that we weren’t discussing somebody whom we\nknew intimately.\nTalk about people? \nYes\n, but stay on the positive side.\nLet’s make one point clear: Not all conversation is gossip. Bull sessions, shop talk, and just\n“batting the breeze” are necessary at times. They serve a good purpose when they are constructive.\nYou can test your proneness to be a gossiper by taking this test:\n1. Do I spread rumors about other people?\n2. Do I always have good things to say about others?\n3. Do I like to hear reports of a scandal?\n4. Do I judge others only on the basis of facts?\n5. Do I encourage others to bring their rumors to me?\n6. Do I precede my conversations with “Don’t tell anybody”?\n7. Do I keep confidential information confidential?\n8. Do I feel guilty about what I say concerning other people?\nThe right answers are obvious.\nMeditate on this thought for just a moment: Taking an ax and chopping your neighbor’s furniture to\npieces won’t make your furniture look one bit better; and using verbal axes and grenades on another\nperson doesn’t do one thing to make you a better you or me a better me.\n*\nGo first class: that is an excellent rule to follow in everything you do, including the goods and\nservices you buy. Once, to prove the unconditional truth of the go-first-class thinking, I asked a group\nof trainees to give one example of how they had been penny-wise and pound-foolish. Here are some\nsample replies:\n“I bought a low-priced suit from an offbeat retailer. Thought I got a bargain, but the suit was\nsimply no good.”\n“My car needed a new automatic transmission. Took it to an alley garage that agreed to do the job\nfor $25 less than an authorized dealer. The ‘new’ transmission lasted 1,800 miles. And the garage\nwouldn’t make it right.”\n“For months I ate at a real greasy spoon trying to save money. The place wasn’t clean, the food\nwasn’t good, the service—well, you couldn’t call it that—and the clientele was a bunch of down-at-\n\f\nheel-ers. One day a friend persuaded me to join him for lunch at one of the best restaurants in town.\nHe ordered the businessman’s lunch, so I did too. I was amazed at what I got: good food, good\nservice, good atmosphere, and for just a little more than I had been paying at the greasy spoon. I\nlearned a big lesson.”\nThere were many other replies. One fellow reported that he got in trouble with the Bureau of\nInternal Revenue because he used a “bargain” accountant; another went to a cut-rate doctor and later\nlearned he had received a completely wrong diagnosis. Others related the costs of going second class\nin home repairs, hotels, and other goods and services.\nOf course, I’ve heard the argument many times “but I can’t afford to go first class.” The simplest\nanswer is: you cannot afford to go any other way. Certainly in the long run, going first class actually\ncosts you less than going second class. Then, too, it’s better to have fewer things and have quality than\nto have many things and have junk. It’s better, for example, to have one really good pair of shoes than\nto have three pairs of second-class shoes.\nPeople rate you for quality, often subconsciously perhaps. Develop an instinct for quality. It pays.\nAnd it costs no more, often costs less, than second class.\n\f\nMAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENT MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL\n1. Be environment-conscious. Just as body diet makes the body, mind diet makes the mind.\n2. Make your environment work for you, not against you. Don’t let suppressive forces—the negative,\nyou-can’t-do-it people—make you think defeat.\n3. Don’t let small-thinking people hold you back. Jealous people want to see you stumble. Don’t give\nthem that satisfaction.\n4. Get your advice from successful people. Your future is important. Never risk it with freelance\nadvisors who are living failures.\n5. Get plenty of psychological sunshine. Circulate in new groups. Discover new and stimulating\nthings to do.\n6. Throw thought poison out of your environment. Avoid gossip. Talk about people, but stay on the\npositive side.\n7. Go first class in everything you do. You can’t afford to go any other way.\n\f\n8"

    "raw_text": "MAKE YOUR ATTITUDES YOUR ALLIES\nCan you read minds? Reading minds is easier than you think. Perhaps you’ve never thought of it, but\nyou read the minds of other people, and they read your mind, every day.\nHow do we do it? We do it automatically, through attitude appraisals.\nRemember the song “You Don’t Need to Know the Language to Say You’re in Love”? Bing\nCrosby made it famous some years ago. There’s a whole bookful of applied psychology packed into\nthose simple lyrics. You \ndon’t\n need to know the language to say you’re in love. Anyone who’s ever\nbeen in love knows that.\nAnd you don’t need to know any language to say “I like you” or “I despise you” or “I think you’re\nimportant” or “unimportant” or “I envy you.” You don’t need to know words or to use words to say “I\nlike my job” or “I’m bored” or “I’m hungry.” People speak without a sound.\nHow we think shows through in how we act. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. They reflect\nthinking.\nYou can read the mind of the fellow sitting at a desk. You sense, by observing his expressions and\nmannerisms, how he \nfeels toward his job. You can read the minds of salesmen, students, husbands,\nand wives; you not only can—you \ndo.\nThe expert actors—those in demand in movies and television year after year—in a sense are not\nactors at all. They don’t play their roles. Instead they lose their own identity and actually think and\nfeel like the character they are playing. They’ve \ngot\n to. Else they’d look like phonies and their ratings\nwould plunge.\nAttitudes do more than show through. They “sound” through too. A secretary does more than\nidentify an office when she says, “Good morning, Mr. Shoemaker’s office.” In just five words one\nsecretary says, “I like you. I’m glad you’re calling. I think you are important. I like my job.”\nBut another secretary saying exactly the same words tells you, “You bothered me. I wish you\nhadn’t called. I’m bored with my job, and I don’t like people who bother me.”\nWe read attitudes through expressions and voice tones and inflections. Here’s why. In the long,\nlong history of humankind, a speaking language even remotely resembling what we use today is a very\nrecent invention. So recent, you might say, in terms of the great clock of time, that we developed a\nlanguage only this morning. For millions and millions of years, people got by with little more than\nmoans and groans and grunts and growls.\nSo for millions of years people communicated with other people by body and facial expressions\nand sounds, not words. And we still communicate our attitudes, our feelings toward people and\nthings, the same way. Aside from direct body contact, body movements, facial expressions, and sound\nare the only ways we have to communicate with infants. And those young ones show an uncanny\nability to spot the phony.\nProfessor Erwin H. Schell, one of America’s most respected authorities on leadership, says,\n“Obviously, there is something more than facilities and competence that makes for accomplishment. I\nhave come to believe that this linkage factor, this catalyst, if you will, can be defined in a single word\n\f\n—\nattitude.\n When our attitude is right, our abilities reach a maximum of effectiveness and good results\ninevitably follow.”\nAttitudes \ndo\n make the difference. Salesmen with the right attitude beat their quotas; students with\nthe right attitude make As; right attitudes pave the way to really happy married life. Right attitudes\nmake you effective in dealing with people, enable you to develop as a leader. Right attitudes win for\nyou in every situation.\nGrow these three attitudes. Make them your allies in everything you do.\n1. Grow the attitude of \nI’m activated.\n2. Grow the attitude of \nYou are important.\n3. Grow the attitude of \nService first.\nNow let’s see how.\nYears ago, when I was a college sophomore, I enrolled in an American history class. I remember\nthe class vividly, not because I learned much about American history but because in an unusual way I\nlearned this basic principle of successful living: \nTo activate others, you must first activate yourself.\nThe history class was very large, and it was held in a fan-shaped auditorium. The professor, who\nwas a middle-aged fellow \nand apparently well educated, was, nevertheless, pathetically dull. Rather\nthan interpret history as an alive, fascinating subject, the professor merely cited one dead fact after\nanother. It was a frightful wonder how he could possibly make such an interesting subject so terribly\ndull. But he did.\nYou can imagine the effect the professor’s boredom had on the students. Talking and sleeping got\nso out of hand that the professor had two assistants patrol the aisles to break up student conversations\nand wake up those who had dozed off.\nOccasionally, the professor would stop and, shaking his finger at the class, would say, “I’m\nwarning you. You’ve got to pay attention to what I say. You’ve got to stop this talking, and that’s all\nthere is to it.” This, of course, made little impression on his students, many of whom, as veterans, had\ngambled their lives only months before, had made history on islands and in bombers.\nAs I sat there watching this potentially great, wonderful experience turn into a disgusting farce, I\nfound myself wrestling with the question “Why are the students ignoring what the professor has to\nsay?”\nThe answer came.\nThe students had no interest in what the professor was saying because the professor himself had\nno interest. He was bored with history, and it showed through. \nTo activate others, to get them to be\nenthusiastic, you must first be enthusiastic yourself.\nOver the years I’ve tested this principle in hundreds of different situations. It always holds true. A\nman who lacks enthusiasm never develops it in another. But a person who is enthusiastic soon has\nenthusiastic followers.\nThe enthusiastic salesman need never worry about unenthusiastic buyers. The enthusiastic teacher\nneed never worry \nabout disinterested students. The activated minister need never be distressed by a\nsleepy congregation.\nEnthusiasm can make things 1,100 percent better.\n Two years ago, employees in a business I’m\n\f\nacquainted with donated $94.35 to the Red Cross. This year the same employees, with just about the\nsame payroll, donated almost $1,100, an increase of 1,100 percent.\nThe drive captain who collected only $94.35 was totally lacking in enthusiasm. He made remarks\nlike “I suppose it’s a worthwhile organization”; “I’ve never had any direct contact with it”; “It’s a big\norganization and they collect a lot from the wealthy, so I suppose it’s not too important if you\ncontribute”; “If you can make a donation, see me.” This fellow did nothing to inspire anyone to want\nto join the Red Cross and do it in a big way.\nThis year’s drive captain was a different sort. He had enthusiasm. He gave examples of case\nhistories that showed how the Red Cross pitches in when disaster strikes. He showed how the Red\nCross depends on donations from everyone. He asked the employees to be guided in giving by how\nmuch they would be willing to give their neighbor if disaster should strike him. He said, “Look what\nthe Red Cross has done!” Notice, he did not beg. He did not say, “Each of you is expected to donate\nXX dollars.” All he did was to show enthusiasm about the importance of the Red Cross. Success just\nnaturally followed.\nThink for a moment about a club or civic organization you know that is fading away. Chances are,\nall it needs is enthusiasm to bring it back to life.\nResults come in proportion to enthusiasm applied.\nEnthusiasm is simply “This is great!” Here’s why.\nHere is a three-step procedure that will help you to develop the power of enthusiasm.\n1. Dig into it deeper.\n Make this little test. Think of two things in which you have little or no interest\n—maybe cards, certain kinds of music, a sport. Now ask yourself, “How much do I really know about\nthese things?” Odds are 100 to 1 that your answer is “Not much.”\nI confess that for years I had absolutely no interest in modern art. It was just so many botched-up\nlines—until I let a friend who knows and loves modern art explain it to me. Really, now that I’ve dug\ninto it, I find it fascinating.\nThat exercise supplies one important key for building enthusiasm: To get enthusiastic, learn more\nabout the thing you are not enthusiastic about.\nChances are you are quite unenthusiastic about bumblebees. But if you study bumblebees, find out\nwhat good they do, how they relate to other bees, how they reproduce, where they live in winter—if\nyou find out all you can about bumblebees, you will soon find yourself really interested in\nbumblebees.\nTo show trainees how enthusiasm can be developed through the dig-into-it-deeper technique, I\nsometimes use a greenhouse example. In a deliberately casual way I ask the group, “Are any of you\ninterested in manufacturing and selling greenhouses?” Not once have I gotten an affirmative answer.\nThen I make a few points about greenhouses: I remind the group how, as our standard of living rises,\npeople become more and more interested in nonnecessities. I suggest how much Mrs. America would\nenjoy growing her own orchids and orange blossoms. I point out that if tens of thousands of families\ncan afford private swimming \npools, millions could afford greenhouses because greenhouses are\nrelatively inexpensive. I show them that if you could sell a $600 greenhouse to only one family in\nfifty, you’d develop a $600 million business in producing greenhouses, and perhaps a $250 million\nindustry supplying plants and seeds.\nThe only difficulty with this exercise is that the group, ten minutes before completely cold about\ngreenhouses, now is so enthusiastic they don’t want to move on to the next subject!\nUse the dig-into-it-deeper technique to develop enthusiasm toward other people. Find out all you\n\f\ncan about another person—what he does, his family, his background, his ideas and ambitions—and\nyou’ll find your interest in and enthusiasm about him mounting. Keep digging, and you’re certain to\nfind some common interests. Keep digging, and you’ll eventually discover a fascinating person.\nThe dig-into-it-deeper technique works also in developing enthusiasm toward new places.\nSeveral years ago some young friends of mine decided to move from Detroit to a small town in mid-\nFlorida. They sold their home, closed out their business connections, said good-bye to their friends,\nand were gone.\nSix weeks later they were back in Detroit. The reason had nothing to do with employment. Rather,\nas they put it, “We just couldn’t stand living in a small town. Besides, all our friends are in Detroit.\nWe just had to come back.”\nIn later conversations with these people, I learned the real reason why they didn’t like the small\nFlorida city. During their short stay there, they had taken only a surface view of the community—its\nhistory, its plans for the future, its people. They moved their bodies to Florida but left their minds in\nDetroit.\nI’ve talked with dozens of executives, engineers, and salesmen \nwho have developed career\ntrouble because their companies want to move them to another location but they don’t want to go. “I\njust can’t see moving to Chicago (or San Francisco or Atlanta or New York or Miami)” is a remark\nspoken many times a day.\nThere’s one way to build enthusiasm toward a new location. Simply resolve to dig into the new\ncommunity. Learn all you can about it. Mix with the people. Make yourself feel and think like a\ncommunity citizen from the very first day. Do this, and you’ll be enthusiastic about your new\nenvironment.\nToday millions of Americans invest in corporate securities. But there are many millions more\nwho have no interest at all in the stock market. That’s because they are people who have not\nfamiliarized themselves with what the securities market is, how it operates, the day-to-day romance\nof American business.\nTo get enthusiasm about anything—people, places, things—dig into it deeper.\nDig into it deeper, and you’ll develop enthusiasm. Put this principle to work next time you must\ndo something you don’t want to do. Put this principle to work next time you find yourself becoming\nbored. Just dig in deeper and you dig up interest.\n2. In everything you do, life it up.\n Enthusiasm, or lack of it, shows through in everything you do and\nsay. Life up your handshaking. When you shake hands, \nshake.\n Make your handclasp say, “I’m \nglad\n to\nknow you.” “I \nam\n glad to see you again.” A conservative, mouse-like handshake is worse than no\nhandshake at all. It makes people think, “This guy is more dead than alive.” Try to find a highly\nsuccessful person with a conservative handshake. You’ll have to look a long, long time.\nLife up your smiles. Smile with your eyes. Nobody likes an artificial, pasted-on, rubbery smile.\nWhen you smile, \nsmile.\n Show a few teeth. Maybe your teeth aren’t attractive, but that’s really\nunimportant. For when you smile, people don’t see your teeth. They see a warm, enthusiastic\npersonality, someone they like.\nLife up your “thank yous.” A routine, automatic “thank you” is almost like saying “gleep, gleep.”\nIt’s just an expression. It says nothing. It doesn’t accomplish results. Make your “thank you” mean\n“thank you \nvery\n much.”\nLife up your talk. Dr. James F. Bender, the noted speech authority, in his excellent book \nHow to\nTalk Well\n, says, “Is your ‘Good morning!’ really good? Are your ‘Congratulations!’ enthusiastic?\n\f\nDoes your ‘How are you?’ sound interested? When you make a habit of coloring your words with\nsincere feelings you’ll notice a great uptake in your ability to hold attention.”\nPeople go along with the fellow who \nbelieves\n what he says. Say it with \nlife.\n Put vitality into your\nspeaking. Whether you are talking to a garden club, a prospect, or your children, put enthusiasm\nbehind what you say. A sermon delivered enthusiastically may be remembered for months, even years.\nBut a sermon delivered without enthusiasm will be mostly forgotten 167 hours before next Sunday\nrolls around.\nAnd when you put life in your talk, you automatically put more life in you. Just try this right now.\nSay out loud with force and vigor: “I feel great today!” Now, don’t you actually feel better than you\ndid before you said it? Make yourself alive all over.\nLife it up. Be sure everything you do and say tells people, “That fellow is alive.” “He means it.”\n“He’s going places.”\n3. Broadcast good news.\n You and I have been in many situations when someone burst in and said:\n“I’ve got good news.” Immediately this person gets 100 percent attention from everyone present.\nGood news does more than get attention; good news pleases people. Good news develops\nenthusiasm. Good news even promotes good digestion.\nJust because there are more broadcasters of bad news than there are broadcasters of good news,\ndon’t be misled. No one ever won a friend, no one ever made money, no one ever accomplished\nanything by broadcasting bad news.\nTransmit good news to your family. Tell them the good that happened today. Recall the amusing,\npleasant things you experienced and let the unpleasant things stay buried. Spread good news. It’s\npointless to pass on the bad. It only makes your family worry, makes them nervous. Bring home some\nsunlight every day.\nEver notice how seldom children complain about the weather? They take hot weather in stride\nuntil the negative news corps educate them to be conscious of unpleasant temperatures. Make it a\nhabit always to speak favorably about the weather regardless of what the weather actually is.\nComplaining about the weather makes you more miserable and it spreads misery to others.\nBroadcast good news about how you feel. Be an “I-feel-great” person. Just say “I feel great” at\nevery possible opportunity, and you \nwill\n feel better. By the same token, tell people, “I feel awful, just\nawful,” and you will feel worse. How we feel is, in large part, determined by how we think we feel.\nRemember, too, that other people want to be around alive, enthusiastic people. Being around\ncomplainers and half-dead people is uncomfortable.\nTransmit good news to the people you work with. Give them encouragement, compliment them at\nevery opportunity. Tell them about the positive things the company is doing. Listen to their problems.\nBe helpful. Encourage people and win their support. Pat them on the back for the job they’re doing.\nGive them hope. Let them know you believe they can succeed, that you have faith in them. Practice\nrelieving worriers.\nMake this little test regularly to keep you on the right track. Whenever you leave a person, ask\nyourself, “Does that person honestly feel better because he has talked with me?” This self-training\ndevice works. Apply it when talking with employees, associates, your family, customers, even with\ncasual acquaintances.\nA salesman friend is a real good-news broadcaster. He calls on his customers every month and\nalways makes it a rule to have some good news to pass along.\nExamples: “I met one of your good friends last week. He said to tell you hello.” “Since I was here\n\f\nlast big things have happened. Over 350,000 new babies were born last month, and more babies mean\nmore business for both of us.”\nUsually we think of bank presidents as overly reserved, unemotional people who never really\nwarm up. Not so with one bank president. His favorite way to answer the phone is to say, “Good\nmorning\n, it’s a wonderful world. May I sell you some money?” Improper for a banker? Some might\nsay so, but let me point out that the banker who uses this greeting is Mills Lane, Jr., president of the\nCitizens and Southern Bank, the largest in the entire Southeast.\nGood news gets good results. Broadcast it.\nThe president of a brush-manufacturing company I visited \nrecently had this maxim neatly framed\non his desk facing the visitor’s chair: “Give me a Good Word or none at all.” I complimented him,\nsaying that I thought the maxim was a clever way to encourage people to be optimistic.\nHe smiled and said, “It is an effective reminder. But from where I sit this is even more\nimportant.” He turned the frame around so I could see it from his side of the desk. It said, “Give them\na Good Word or none at all.”\nBroadcasting good news activates you, makes you feel better. Broadcasting good news makes\nother people feel better too."

    "raw_text": "GROW THE “YOU-ARE-IMPORTANT” ATTITUDE\nThis is a fact of paramount significance: Each human being, whether he lives in India or Indianapolis,\nwhether he’s ignorant or brilliant, civilized or uncivilized, young or old, has this desire: \nHe wants to\nfeel important.\nPonder on that. Everyone, yes, everyone—your neighbor, you, your wife, your boss—has a natural\ndesire to feel he is “somebody.” The desire to be important is man’s strongest, most compelling\nnonbiological hunger.\nSuccessful advertisers know that people crave prestige, distinction, recognition. Headlines that\nproduce sales read like this: “For Smart Young Homemakers”; “Persons with Distinctive Tastes Use\n—”; “You Want Only the Best”; “Be the Envy of Everyone”; “For Women Who Want to Be Envied by\nWomen and Admired by Men.” These headlines in effect tell people, “Buy this product, and you put\nyourself in the important class.”\nSatisfying the craving, the hunger, to be important carries you forward to success. It is basic\nequipment in your success tool chest. Yet (and read this sentence again before you go on) even \nthough\ndisplaying the attitude “You are important” gets results, and even though it costs nothing, few persons\nuse it. A little fill-in is needed here to show why.\nOn the philosophical side, our religions, our laws, our entire culture are based on the belief of the\nimportance of the individual.\nSuppose, for example, you were flying your own plane and were forced down in an isolated\nmountain region. As soon as your accident was known, a large-scale search for you would begin. No\none would ask, “Is that fellow important?” Without knowing anything about you except that you are a\nhuman being, helicopters, other aircraft, and searching parties on foot would begin looking for you.\nAnd they would keep on looking for you, spending thousands of dollars in the process, until they\nfound you or until not one trace of hope remained.\nWhen a little child wanders off into a woods, falls into a well, or gets into some other dangerous\npredicament, no one is concerned with whether or not the child comes from an “important” family.\nEvery effort is made to rescue the child because \nevery\n child is important.\nIt’s not too wild a guess that, of all living creatures, probably not more than one in ten million is a\nhuman being. A person is a biological rarity. He is important in God’s scheme of things.\n*\nNow let’s look at the practical side. When most people shift their thinking from philosophical\ndiscussions to everyday situations, they tend to forget, unfortunately, their ivory-tower concepts of the\nimportance of individuals. Tomorrow, take a good look at how most people exhibit an attitude that\nseems to say, “You are \na nobody; you count for nothing; you mean nothing, absolutely nothing to me.”\nThere is a reason why the “you are unimportant” attitude prevails. Most folks look at another\nperson and think, “He can’t do anything for me. Therefore, he’s not important.”\nBut right there is where people make a basic blunder. The other person, \nregardless\n of his status or\nhis income, is important to you and for two giant, dollars-and-cents reasons.\nFirst, \npeople do more for you when you make them feel important.\n Years ago, in Detroit, I rode a\ncertain bus to work each morning. The driver was an old grump. Dozens—maybe hundreds—of\ntimes, I saw this driver pull away from the curb when a wildly waving, shouting, and running\npassenger was just a second or two from the door. Over a period of several months I saw this driver\nshow special courtesy to only one passenger, and this passenger was shown special courtesy many\n\f\ntimes. The driver would wait for \nthis\n passenger.\nAnd why? Because this passenger went out of his way to make the driver feel important. Every\nmorning he greeted the driver with a personalized, sincere “Good morning, sir.” Sometimes this\npassenger would sit near the driver and make little comments like “You sure have a lot of\nresponsibility”; “It must take nerves of steel to drive through traffic like this every day”; “You sure\nkeep this thing on schedule.” That passenger made the driver feel as important as if he were piloting a\n180-passenger jet airliner. And the driver in return showed special courtesy to the passenger.\nIt pays to make “little” people feel like big people.\nToday, in thousands of offices all over America, secretaries are helping salesmen make sales or\nlose sales depending on how \nthe salesman has treated them. Make someone feel important, and he\ncares about you. And when he cares about you, he does more for you.\nCustomers will buy more from you, employees will work harder for you, associates will go out of\ntheir way to cooperate with you, your boss will do more to help you if you will only make these\npeople feel important.\nIt pays to make “big” people feel even bigger. The big thinker always adds value to people by\nvisualizing them at their best. Because he thinks big about people, he gets their best out of them.\n*\nHere’s the second giant reason for making others feel important: \nWhen you help others feel\nimportant, you help yourself feel important too.\nOne of the elevator operators who carried me “up and down” for several months had the look of\ncomplete unimportance written all over. She was fiftyish, unattractive, and certainly uninspired in her\nwork. It was obvious that her longing to be important was completely unfulfilled. She was one of the\nmillions of people who live for months at a time without ever being given a reason to believe that\nsomeone notices them or cares about them.\nOne morning shortly after I became one of her regular “uppers and downers,” I noticed that she\nhad had her hair redone. It was nothing fancy. It was obviously a home-made job. But it had been cut\nand it did look better.\nSo I said, “Miss S. (Note: I had learned her name), I do like what you’ve done to your hair. It\nreally looks fine.” She blushed, said, “Thank you, sir,” and nearly missed her next stop. She\nappreciated the compliment.\nNext morning, lo and behold, when I stepped into the elevator I heard, “Good morning, Dr.\nSchwartz.” Not one time before had I heard this operator address anyone by name. And in the\nremaining months that I had an office in the building I never heard anyone called by name except me. I\nhad made the operator feel important. I had sincerely complimented her and called her by name.\nI had made her feel important. Now she was repaying me by making me feel important.\nLet’s not kid ourselves. People who do not have a deep-down feeling of self-importance are\nslated for mediocrity. Again and again this point must be driven home: \nYou must feel important to\nsucceed. Helping others to feel important rewards you because it makes you feel more important.\nTry it and see.\n Here’s how to do it:\n1. \nPractice appreciation.\n Make it a rule to let others know you appreciate what they do for you.\nNever, never let anyone feel he is taken for granted. Practice appreciation with a warm, sincere\nsmile. A smile lets others know you notice them and feel kindly toward them.\nPractice appreciation by letting others know how you depend on them. An earnest “Jim, I don’t\n\f\nknow what we’d do without you” type of remark makes people feel necessary, and when they feel\nnecessary they do increasingly better work.\nPractice appreciation with honest, personalized compliments. People thrive on compliments—\nwhether two or twenty, nine or ninety, a person craves praise. He wants to be assured that he’s doing\na good job, that he is important. Don’t feel that you should hand out praise only for big\naccomplishments. Compliment people on little things: their appearance, the way they do their routine\nwork, their ideas, their loyal efforts. Praise \nby writing personal notes complimenting people you\nknow on their achievements. Make a special phone call or a special trip to see them.\nDon’t waste time or mental energy trying to classify people as “very important persons,”\n“important persons,” or “unimportant persons.” Make no exceptions. A person, whether he is garbage\ncollector or company vice president, is important to you. Treating someone as second-class never\ngets you first-class results.\n2. \nPractice calling people by their names.\n Every year shrewd manufacturers sell more\nbriefcases, pencils, Bibles, and hundreds of other items just by putting the buyer’s name on the\nproduct. People like to be called by name. It gives everyone a boost to be addressed by name.\nTwo special things you must remember. Pronounce the name correctly, and spell it correctly. If\nyou mispronounce or misspell someone’s name, that person feels that you feel he is unimportant.\nAnd here’s one special reminder: When talking with people you don’t know well, add the\nappropriate title—Miss, Mister, or Mrs. The office boy prefers Mr. Jones to just Jones. So does your\njunior assistant. So do people at every level. These little titles help tremendously to make people feel\nimportant.\n3. \nDon’t hog glory, invest it instead.\n Just recently I was a guest at an all-day sales convention.\nAfter dinner that evening the vice president in charge of sales for the company passed out awards to\nthe two district managers, a man and a woman, whose sales organizations had attained the best\nrecords for the year just ended. Then the vice president asked those district managers to take fifteen\nminutes to tell the entire group how their organizations did so exceptionally well.\nThe first district manager (who, I later learned, had been appointed a manager only three months\nbefore and was therefore only partially responsible for his organization’s record) got up and\nexplained how \nhe\n did it.\nHe conveyed the impression that \nhis\n efforts and \nhis\n efforts alone caused the sales increase.\nRemarks such as “When \nI\n took over, \nI\n did such-and-such”; “Things were in a mess but \nI\n cleared them\nup”; “It wasn’t easy but \nI\n just grabbed hold of the situation and wouldn’t let go” characterized his\ntalk.\nAs he talked, I could see the increasing resentment gathering in the faces of his salesmen. They\nwere being ignored for the sake of the district manager’s personal glory. Their hard work, which was\nresponsible for the sales increase, was completely unrecognized.\nThen, the second district manger got up to make her short talk. But this lady used an entirely\ndifferent approach. First, she explained that the reason for her organization’s success was the\nwholehearted effort of her sales force. Then she asked each one to stand and paid a sincere personal\ncompliment to each for his or her efforts.\nNote this difference; the first manager squandered the vice president’s praise entirely on himself.\nIn doing so, he offended his own people. His sales force was demoralized. The second passed the\npraise on to her sales force, where it could do \nmore\n good. This manager knew that praise, like money,\ncan be invested to pay dividends. She knew that passing the credit on to her salespeople would make\nthem work even harder next year.\n\f\nRemember, praise is power. Invest the praise you receive from your superior. Pass praise on\ndown to your subordinates, where it will encourage still greater performance. When you \nshare praise,\nyour subordinates know you sincerely appreciate their value.\nHere’s a daily exercise that pays off surprisingly well. Ask yourself every day, “What can I do\ntoday to make my wife and family happy?”\nThis may seem almost too simple, but it is amazingly effective. One evening, as part of a sales\ntraining program, I was discussing “Building the Home Environment for Selling Success.” To\nillustrate a point, I asked the salesmen (who were all married), “When was the last time, aside from\nChristmas, your wedding anniversary, or her birthday, that you surprised your wife with a special\ngift?”\nEven I was shocked at the answers. Of the thirty-five salesmen, only one had surprised his wife in\nthe past month. Many of the group answered “between three and six months.” And over a third said, “I\ncan’t remember.”\nImagine! And some men wonder why their wives no longer treat them like Mr. King with a crown!\nI wanted to impress these salesmen with the power of the thoughtful gift. The next evening I\narranged to have a florist appear just before the close of the session. I introduced him and leveled\nwith them: “I want each of you to discover what a little unexpected remembrance will do to build a\nbetter home environment. I’ve arranged with the florist for each of you to get a fine, long-stemmed red\nrose for just 50 cents. Now if you don’t have 50 cents, or if you think your wife isn’t worth that [they\nlaughed], I’ll buy the flower for her myself. All I ask is that you take the rose to your wife and then\ntomorrow evening tell us what happened.\n“Don’t, of course, tell her how you came to purchase this rose for her.”\nThey understood.\nWithout exception, every fellow testified the next evening that the mere investment of 50 cents had\nmade his wife happy.\nDo something special for your family often. It doesn’t have to be something expensive. It’s\nthoughtfulness that counts. Anything that shows that you put your family’s interests first will do the\ntrick.\nGet the family on your team. \nGive them planned attention.\nIn this busy age a lot of people never seem able to find time for their families. But if we plan, we\ncan find it. One company vice president told me of this method, which he says works well for him:\n“My job carries a lot of responsibility, and I have no choice but to bring quite a lot of work home\nevery night. But I will not neglect my family because it’s the most important thing in my life. It’s the\nmain reason I work as hard as I do. I’ve worked out a schedule that enables me to give attention to my\nfamily as well as to my work. From 7:30 to 8:30 every evening I devote my time to my two young\nchildren. I play games with them, read them stories, draw, answer questions—anything they want me\nto do. After an hour with those kids of mine, they’re not only satisfied, but I’m 100 percent fresher. At\n8:30 they trot off to bed, and I settle down to work for two hours.\n“At 10:30 I quit working and spend the next hour with my wife. We talk about the kids, her\nvarious activities, our plans for the future. This hour, undisturbed by anything, is a wonderful way to\ncap off the day.\n“I also reserve Sundays for my family. The whole day is theirs. I find my organized program for\ngiving my family the attention it deserves is good not only for them, but also good for me. It gives me\nnew energy.”\n\f\nWANT TO MAKE MONEY? THEN GET THE PUT-SERVICE-FIRST ATTITUDE\nIt’s perfectly natural—in fact, it’s highly desirable—to want to make money and accumulate wealth.\nMoney is power to give your family and yourself the standard of living they deserve. Money is power\nto help the unfortunate. Money is one of the means to living life fully.\nOnce criticized for urging people to make money, the great minister Russel H. Conwell, author of\nAcres of Diamonds\n, said, “Money printed your Bible, money builds your churches, money sends your\nmissionaries, and money pays your preachers, and you would not have many of them, either, if you did\nnot pay them.”\nThe person who says he wants to be poor usually suffers from a guilt complex or a feeling of\ninadequacy. He’s like the youngster who feels he can’t make As in school or make the football team,\nso he pretends he doesn’t want to make As or play football.\nMoney, then, is a desirable objective. What’s puzzling about money is the backward approach so\nmany people use in trying to make it. Everywhere you see people with a “money-first” attitude. Yet\nthese same people always have little money. Why? Simply this: People with a money-first attitude\nbecome so money conscious that they forget money can’t be harvested unless they plant the seeds that\ngrow the money.\nAnd the seed of money is service. That’s why “put service first” is an attitude that creates wealth.\nPut service first, and money takes care of itself.\nOne summer evening I was traveling by car through Cincinnati. It was time for a gas-up. I stopped\nat an ordinary-looking but surprisingly busy service station.\nFour minutes later I knew why this particular service station was so popular. After filling my car\nwith gasoline, checking under the hood, and cleaning the outside of my windshield, the attendant\nwalked around to my side of the car and said, “Pardon me, sir. It’s been a dusty day. Let me clean the\ninside of your windshield.”\nQuickly and efficiently, he did a thorough job of cleaning the inside of my windshield, something\nnot one service station attendant in a hundred ever does.\nThis little special service did more than improve my night visibility (and it improved it a lot); it\nmade me remember this station. It so happened that I made eight trips through Cincinnati during the\nnext three months. Each time, of course, I stopped at this station. And each time I got more service\nthan I expected to get. Interesting too was the fact that each time I stopped (once it was 4 \nA.M.\n) there\nwere other automobiles filling up also. In all, I probably purchased about 100 gallons of gasoline\nfrom this station.\nThe first time I stopped the attendant could have thought to himself, “This guy is from out of state.\nOdds are twenty to one that he’ll never be back. Why do more than give him the routine treatment?\nHe’s only a one-time customer.”\nBut the attendants in that station didn’t think that way. They put service first, and that’s why they\nwere busy pumping gasoline while other stations looked almost deserted. If the gasoline was any\nbetter than a dozen other brands, I didn’t notice it. And the price was competitive.\nThe difference was service. And it was obvious that service was paying off in profits.\nWhen the attendant on my first visit cleaned the inside of my windshield, he planted a money seed.\nPut service first, and money takes care of itself—always.\nThe put-service-first attitude pays off in all situations. In one of my first jobs I worked closely\nwith another young fellow, whom I’ll call F. H.\nF. H. was like many persons you know. He was preoccupied with why he needed more money\ninstead of being preoccupied with ways to make money. Each week F. H. spent hours of company time\n\f\nworking on his personal budget problems. His favorite topic of conversation was “I’m the most\nunderpaid man here. Let me tell you why.”\nF. H. had the not uncommon attitude of “This is a big company. It’s netting millions. It’s paying a\nlot of people big salaries, so it ought to pay me more too.”\nF. H. had been passed over several times for pay increases. Finally one day he decided that it was\nhigh time he went in there and demanded more money. About thirty minutes later F. H. was back, all\nheated up. His expression made it obvious that next month’s check would look exactly like this\nmonth’s check.\nImmediately F. H. began to let go. “Boy, am I mad! What do you suppose the old man said when I\ntold him I wanted more money? He had the gall to ask me, ‘Why do you believe you are justified in\nasking for an increase?’\n“I gave him plenty of reasons,” F. H. went on. “I told him I’d been passed over when others\naround here were getting pay raises. I told him my bills are getting larger and my paycheck isn’t. And\nI told him that I do everything around here they ask me to do.\n“Can you beat that? I \nneed\n a raise, but instead of paying me more, they give out raises to other\nguys around here who don’t need it half as much as I do.\n“Why, the way he acted,” F. H. continued, “you’d think I was asking for charity. All he would say\nis ‘When your record shows that you deserve more money, you’ll get more money.’\n“Sure, I could do a better job if they paid me for it, but only a fool does something he isn’t paid\nfor.”\nF. H. is an example of the breed that is blind to the “how” of making money. His last remark sums\nup his mistake. In effect, F. H. wanted the company to pay him more and \nthen\n he would produce more.\nBut this is not how the system works. You don’t get a raise on the promise of better performance; you\nget a raise only by demonstrating better performance. You can’t harvest money unless you plant the\nseeds that grow money. And the seed of money is service.\nPut service first, and money takes care of itself.\nConsider which producers make the money from movies. The get-rich-quick producer proceeds to\nmake a picture. Putting money ahead of entertainment (service), he cuts corners everywhere. He buys\na poorly written script and employs second-rate writers to adapt it. In employing actors, arranging\nsets, even recording sound, he puts money first. This producer thinks the moviegoer is a sucker,\nsomeone who can’t tell good from bad.\nBut the get-rich-quick producer seldom does get rich quick. There never is a bandwagon\nmovement to buy anything second-class, especially when it is given a first-class price.\nThe producer who enjoys the largest profits from pictures puts entertainment ahead of money.\nRather than chisel the moviegoer, he does everything possible to give people more and better\nentertainment than they expect to get. The result: people like the movie. It gets talked about. It gets\ngood reviews. And it makes money.\nAgain, put service first, and money takes care of itself.\nThe waitress who concentrates on giving the best possible service needn’t worry about tips;\nthey’ll be there. But her counterpart who overlooks the empty coffee cups (“Why refill them? They\ndon’t look like tippers.”) won’t find any gratuities.\nThe secretary who resolves to make those letters look better than the boss expects will do all\nright on future paychecks. But the secretary who thinks, “Why worry about a few smudges? What do\nthey expect for $65 a week?”—she is stuck at $65 a week.\nThe salesman who gives full service to an account need harbor no fears he’ll lose the account.\n\f\nHere is a simple but powerful rule that will help you to develop the put-service-first attitude:\nAlways give people more than they expect to get.\n Each little extra something you do for others is a\nmoney seed. Volunteering to work late and get the department out of a tight spot is a money seed;\ngiving customers \nextra\n service is a money seed because it brings customers back; advancing a new\nidea that will increase efficiency is a money seed.\nMoney seeds, of course, grow money. Plant service and harvest money.\nSpend some time each day answering this question: “How can I give more than is expected of\nme?” Then apply the answers.\nPut service first, and money takes care of itself.\nIn quick recap, grow attitudes that will carry you forward to success.\n1. Grow the “\nI’m activated\n” attitude. Results come in proportion to the enthusiasm invested. Three\nthings to do to activate yourself are:\nDig into it deeper. When you find yourself uninterested in something, dig in and learn\nmore about it. This sets off enthusiasm.\nLife up everything about you: your smile, your handshake, your talk, even your walk.\nAct alive.\nBroadcast good news. No one ever accomplished anything positive telling bad news.\n2. Grow the “You are important” attitude. People do more for you when you make them feel\nimportant. Remember to do these things:\nShow appreciation at every opportunity. Make people feel important.\nCall people by name.\n3. Grow the “Service first” attitude, and watch money take care of itself. Make it a rule in everything\nyou do: give people more than they expect to get.\n\f\n9"

    "raw_text": "THINK RIGHT TOWARD PEOPLE\nHere is a basic rule for winning success. Let’s mark it in the mind and remember it. The rule is:\nSuccess depends on the support of other people.\n The only hurdle between you and what you want to\nbe is the support of others.\nLook at it this way: an executive depends on people to carry out his instructions. If they don’t, the\ncompany president will fire the executive, not the employees. A salesman depends on people to buy\nhis product. If they don’t, the salesman fails. Likewise, a college dean depends on professors to carry\nforward his educational program; a politician depends on voters to elect him; a writer depends on\npeople to read what he writes. A chain store magnate got to be a chain store magnate because\nemployees accepted his leadership and consumers accepted his merchandising program.\nThere were times in history when a person could gain a position of authority through force and\nhold it with force and/or threats of force. In those days a man either cooperated with the “leader” or\nrisked literally losing his head.\nBut today, remember, a person either supports you \nwillingly\n or he doesn’t support you at all.\nNow it’s time to ask, “Granted, I depend on others in order \nto achieve the success I want, but\nwhat must I do to get these people to support me and accept my leadership?”\nThe answer, wrapped up in one phrase, is \nthink right toward people.\n Think right toward people,\nand they will like and support you. This chapter shows how.\nThousands of times daily a scene like this takes place. A committee or group is in session. The\npurpose—to consider names for a promotion, a new job, a club membership, an honor, someone to be\nthe new company president, the new supervisor, the new sales manager. A name is placed before the\ngroup. The chairman asks, “What is your feeling about so-and-so?”\nComments come forth. For some names there are positive remarks, such as “He’s a good fellow.\nPeople there speak highly of him. He has a good technical background, too.”\n“Mr. F.? Oh, he’s a personable sort of man, very human. I believe he would fit in well with our\ngroup.”\nSome names draw negative, lukewarm statements. “I think we should investigate that fellow\ncarefully. He doesn’t seem to get along too well with people.”\n“I know he has a good academic and technical background; I don’t question his competence. But I\nam concerned about the acceptance he would receive. He doesn’t command much respect from\npeople.”\nNow, here is an exceptionally important observation: \nIn at least nine cases out of ten, the\n“likability” factor is the first thing mentioned. And in an overwhelmingly large number of cases,\nthe “likability” factor is given far more weight than the technical factor.\nThe above holds true even in selecting scholars for university professorships. In my own\nacademic experience I’ve sat in \non a considerable number of occasions when names for new faculty\npersonnel were under question. When a name came up, the group would weigh most carefully\nthoughts such as “Will he fit in?” “Will students like him?” “Will he cooperate with others on the\n\f\nstaff?”\nUnfair? Unacademic? No. If the fellow isn’t likable, he can’t be expected to get through to his\nstudents with maximum effectiveness.\nMark this point well. A person is not \npulled up\n to a higher-level job. Rather, he is \nlifted up.\n In\nthis day and age nobody has time or patience to \npull\n another up the job ladder, degree by painful\ndegree. The individual is chosen whose record makes him stand higher than the rest.\nWe are lifted to higher levels by those who know us as likable, personable individuals. Every\nfriend you make lifts you just one notch higher. And \nbeing likable makes you lighter to lift.\nSuccessful people follow a plan for liking people. Do you?\n People who reach the top don’t\ndiscuss much their techniques for thinking right toward people. But you would be surprised how many\nreally big people have a clear, definite, even \nwritten\n plan for liking people.\nConsider the case of President Lyndon Johnson. Long before he became president, Johnson, in the\nprocess of developing his amazing power of personal persuasion, developed his own ten-point\nformula for success. His rules, which even a casual observer of the president can see are practiced in\neverything he does, are quoted directly:\n1. Learn to remember names. Inefficiency at this point may indicate that your interest is not\nsufficiently outgoing.\n2. Be a comfortable person so there is no strain in being with you. Be an old-shoe kind of\nindividual.\n3. Acquire the quality of relaxed easy-going so that things do not ruffle you.\n4. Don’t be egotistical. Guard against the impression that you know it all.\n5. Cultivate the quality of being interesting so people will get something of value from their\nassociation with you.\n6. Study to get the “scratchy” elements out of your personality, even those of which you may be\nunconscious.\n7. Sincerely attempt to heal, on an honest basis, every misunderstanding you have had or now have.\nDrain off your grievances.\n8. Practice liking people until you learn to do so genuinely.\n9. Never miss an opportunity to say a word of congratulation upon anyone’s achievement, or express\nsympathy in sorrow or disappointment.\n10. Give spiritual strength to people, and they will give genuine affection to you.\nLiving these ten simple but tremendously powerful “like people” rules makes President Johnson\neasier to vote for, easier \nto support in Congress. Living these ten rules makes President Johnson\neasier to lift.\n\f\nReread these rules again. Notice that there’s no get-even philosophy here. There’s no let-the-\nother-fellow-come-to-me-to-patch-up-differences. There’s no I-know-it-all-other-people-are-stupid.\nBig people, those on top in industry, the arts, sciences, and politics, are human, warm. They\nspecialize in being likable.\nBut don’t try to buy friendship; it’s not for sale.\n Giving gifts is a wonderful practice if the gift is\nbacked up with genuine sincerity, a liking to give and liking for the person to whom it is given. But\nwithout real sincerity, the gift is often regarded as nothing more than a payoff or a bribe.\nLast year, just a few days before Christmas, I was in the office of the president of a medium-sized\ntrucking firm. Just as I was about to leave, in marched a delivery man with a gift of liquid refreshment\nfrom a local tire-recapping firm. My friend was obviously provoked and, with a certain amount of\nchill in his voice, asked the delivery man to return the gift to its sender.\nAfter the delivery man left, my friend hastened to explain to me: “Don’t misunderstand. I like to\ngive gifts and I like to get them.”\nThen he named a number of gifts he had already received from business friends that Christmas.\n“But,” he went on, “when the gift is just an attempt to get my business, an obvious bribe, I don’t\nwant it. I quit doing business with that firm three months ago because their work isn’t what it should\nbe and I don’t like the employees. But their salesman keeps on calling.\n“What burns me,” he continued, “is that last week that \nsame d——— salesman was in here and\nhad the gall to say, ‘I sure would like to get your business back. I’m going to tell Santa to be real good\nto you this year.’ If I hadn’t sent their booze back, the first thing that so-and-so would’ve said to me\nnext time he’s in is ‘I’ll bet you enjoyed our gift, didn’t you?’”\nFriendship can’t be bought. And when we try, we lose in two ways:\n1. We waste money.\n2. We create contempt.\nTake the initiative in building friendships—leaders always do.\n It’s easy and natural for us to tell\nourselves, “Let him make the first move.” “Let them call us.” “Let her speak first.”\nIt’s easy, too, virtually to ignore other people.\nYes, it’s easy and natural, but it isn’t right thinking toward people. If you follow the rule of letting\nthe other person build the foundation for friendship, you may not have many friends.\nActually, it’s a mark of real leadership to take the lead in getting to know people. Next time you\nare in a large group, observe something very significant: \nthe most important person present is the\none person most active in introducing himself.\nIt’s always a big person who walks up to you, offers his hand, and says, “Hello, I’m Jack R.”\nDigest this observation for a moment, and you’ll discover the reason the fellow is important is that he\nworks at building friendships.\nThink right toward people. As a friend of mine expresses it, “I may not be very important to him,\nbut he’s important to me. That’s why I’ve got to get to know him.”\nHave you ever noticed how people freeze while waiting for elevators? Unless they are with\nsomeone they know, most folks never say anything to the person standing beside them. One day I\nresolved to do a little experimenting.\nI resolved to say something to the stranger who was waiting as I was. I kept track of his reaction"

    "raw_text": "twenty-five consecutive times. And twenty-five times I got back a positive, friendly response.\nNow, talking to strangers may not be very urbane, but most people like it nevertheless. And here\nis the big payoff:\nWhen you make a pleasant remark to a stranger, you make him feel one degree better. This makes\nyou feel better and helps you relax. Every time you say something pleasant to another person, you\ncompensate yourself. It’s like warming up your automobile on a cold morning.\nHere are six ways to win friends by exercising just a little initiative:\n1. Introduce yourself to others at every possible opportunity—at parties, meetings, on airplanes, at\nwork, everywhere.\n2. Be sure the other person gets \nyour\n name straight.\n3. Be sure you can pronounce the other person’s name the way he pronounces it.\n4. Write down the other person’s name, and be mighty sure you have it spelled correctly; people have\na fetish about \nthe correct spelling of their own names! If possible, get his address and phone\nnumber, also.\n5. Drop a personal note or make a phone call to the new friends you feel you want to know better.\nThis is an important point. Most successful people follow through on new friends with a letter or a\nphone call.\n6. And last but not least, say pleasant things to strangers. It warms you up and gets you ready for the\ntask ahead.\nPutting these six rules to work is really thinking right about people. To be sure, it is not the way\nthe average person thinks. Mr. “Average” never takes the initiative in making introductions. He waits\nfor the other person to introduce himself first.\nTake the initiative. Be like the successful. Go out of your way to meet people. And don’t be timid.\nDon’t be afraid to be unusual. Find out who the other person is, and be sure he knows who you are.\n*\nRecently an associate and I were retained to do a preliminary screening of an applicant for an\nindustrial sales job. We found the applicant, whom we’ll call Ted, to have some good qualifications.\nHe was exceptionally intelligent, made a fine appearance, and seemed to have a lot of ambition.\nBut we found something that forced us to disqualify him, at least temporarily. Ted’s big limitation\nwas this: he expected perfection in other people. Ted was annoyed by many little things, like mistakes\nin grammar, people who were messy with cigarettes, people who had bad taste in clothes, and so on.\nTed was surprised to learn this fact about himself. But he was eager to get into higher-paying\nwork, and he asked whether there was anything we could tell him to help overcome his weakness.\nWe made three suggestions:\n\f\n1. \nRecognize the fact that no person is perfect.\n Some people are more nearly perfect than others, but\nno man is absolutely perfect. The most human quality about human beings is that they make\nmistakes, all kinds of them.\n2. \nRecognize the fact that the other fellow has a right to be different.\n Never play God about\nanything. Never dislike people because their habits are different from your own or because they\nprefer different clothes, religion, parties, or automobiles. You don’t have to approve of what\nanother fellow does, but you must not dislike him for doing it.\n3. \nDon’t be a reformer.\n Put a little more “live and let live” into your philosophy. Most people\nintensely dislike being told “you’re wrong.” You have a right to your own opinion, but sometimes\nit’s better to keep it to yourself.\nTed conscientiously applied these suggestions. A few months later he had a fresh outlook. He now\naccepts people for what they are, neither 100 percent good nor 100 percent bad.\n“Besides,” he says, “the things that used to annoy the heck out of me I now find amusing. It finally\ndawned on me what a dull world this would be if people were all alike and everybody was perfect.”\nNote this simple but key fact: No person is all good and no person is all bad. The perfect person\njust doesn’t exist.\nNow, if we let our thinking go uncontrolled, we can find much to dislike in almost anyone. By the\nsame token, if we manage our thinking properly, if we think right toward people, we can find many\nqualities to like and admire in the same person.\nView it this way. Your mind is a mental broadcasting station. This broadcasting system transmits\nmessages to you on two equally powerful channels: Channel P (positive) and Channel N (negative).\nLet’s see how your broadcasting system works. Suppose that today your business superior (we’ll\ncall him Mr. Jacobs) called you into his office and reviewed your work with you. He complimented\nyou on your work, but he also made some specific suggestions on how you can do it better. Tonight\nit’s only natural for you to recall the incident and do some thinking about it.\nIf you tune in Channel N, the announcer will be saying something like this: “Watch out! Jacobs is\nout to get you. He’s a crab. You don’t need any of his advice. To heck with it. Remember what Joe\ntold you about Jacobs? He was right. Jacobs wants to grind you down like he did Joe. Resist him.\nNext time he calls you in, fight back. Better still, don’t wait. Tomorrow go in and ask him just what he\nreally meant by his criticism . . .”\nBut tune in Channel P, and the announcer will say something along these lines: “You know, Mr.\nJacobs is a pretty good fellow. Those suggestions he made to me seem pretty sound. If I put them to\nuse, I can probably do a better job and position myself for an increase. The old boy did me a favor.\nTomorrow I’ll go in and thank him for his constructive help. Bill was right: Jacobs \nis\n a good man to\nwork with . . .”\nIn this specific case, if you listen to Channel N, you’re almost certain to make some bad, perhaps\nfatal, mistake in your relations with your superior. But if you are tuned to Channel P, you are\ndefinitely certain to benefit from your superior’s suggestions and at the same time draw yourself\ncloser to him. He will appreciate that visit. Try it and see.\nBear in mind that the longer you stay tuned to either Channel P or Channel N, the more interested\nyou become and the harder it is to switch channels. This is true because one thought, positive or\n\f\nnegative, sets off a whole chain reaction of similar thought.\nYou may, for example, start off with such a simple minor negative thought as a person’s accent and\nfind yourself soon thinking negatively about such unrelated topics as his political and religious\nbeliefs, the car he drives, his personal habits, his relationship with his wife, even the way he combs\nhis hair. And thinking this way surely won’t get you where you want to go.\nYou own it, so manage your thought broadcasting station. When your thoughts turn to people, make\nChannel P your listening habit.\nIf Channel N cuts in, say stop. Then switch channels. To make the switch, all you must do is think\nof one positive quality about the individual. In true chain reaction style, this one thought will lead to\nanother and another. And you will be glad.\nWhen you are alone, you and only you can decide whether you will listen to Channel P or Channel\nN. But when you are talking with someone else, that person has a measure of control over how you\nthink.\nWe must remember that most people do not understand \nthe concepts of thinking right toward\npeople. So it’s a very common experience for people to come rushing to you, just aching to say\nsomething negative about a person you both know: a co-worker wants to tell you about the\nobjectionable qualities of another employee; a neighbor wants to let you know the domestic problems\nof another neighbor; or a customer wants to itemize the faults of his competitor, whom you will call\non next.\nThoughts breed like thoughts. There is real danger that if you listen to negative comments about\nanother person, you too will go negative toward that person. In fact, if you are not on guard, you may\nactually find yourself adding fuel to the fire with “Yes, and that’s not all. Did you hear . . .” type of\ncomment.\nThese things backfire, boomerang.\nThere are two ways to prevent others from switching us from Channel P to Channel N. One way is\nto switch topics as quickly and quietly as possible with some remark like “Pardon me, John, but\nwhile I think of it, I’ve been meaning to ask you . . .” A second way is to excuse yourself with a\n“Sorry, John, I’m late now . . .” or “I’ve a deadline to meet. Will you excuse me?”\nMake a forceful promise to yourself. Refuse to let others prejudice your thinking. Stay tuned to\nChannel P.\nOnce you’ve mastered the technique of thinking only good thoughts about people, greater success\nis \nguaranteed.\n Let me tell you what an unusually successful insurance salesman told me about how\nthinking good thoughts about people pays off for him.\n“When I first got in the insurance business,” he began, “the going was tough, believe me. At first it\nseemed there were about \nas many competing agents as there were prospects. And I soon learned what\nall insurance men know, that nine prospects out of ten firmly believe they don’t need any more\ninsurance.\n“I’m doing well. But let me tell you, it’s not because I know a lot about the technical side of\ninsurance. That’s important, don’t misunderstand me, but there are men trying to sell insurance who\nknow policies and contracts better than I. In fact, I know one man who wrote a book about insurance,\nbut he couldn’t sell a policy to a man who knew he had only five days to live.\n“My success,” he continued, “is based on one thing. I like, \nreally\n like the guy I’m selling. Let me\nsay again, I really \nlike\n him. Some of my fellow salesmen try to pretend they like the other fellow, but\nthis won’t work. You can’t even fool a dog. Your mannerisms, eyes, facial expressions, all spell p-h-\no-n-y when you pretend.\n\f\n“Now, when I’m gathering information about a prospect, I do what every other agent does. I get\nhis age, where he works, how much he makes, how many kids he’s got, and so on.\n“But I also get something else which most salesmen never search for—that is, some sound reasons\nwhy I can like the prospect. Maybe the job he’s doing will supply the reason, or perhaps I can find it\nsomeplace in his past record. But I find some good reasons to like him.\n“Then, whenever my attention is focused on the prospect, I review the reasons why I like him. I\nbuild a likable image of the prospect before I say one word to him about insurance.\n“This little technique works. Because I like him, he sooner or later likes me. Pretty soon, instead\nof sitting across the table from him, I’m on the same side with him, and we’re working out \nhis\ninsurance plan together. He trusts and believes in my judgment because I am a friend.\n“Now, people don’t always accept me right off the bat, but I’ve found that so long as I continue to\nlike a fellow, he’ll come around, and we can get down to business.\n“Just last week,” my friend went on, “I was making the third call on a difficult prospect. He met\nme at the door, and before I could even say ‘Good evening,’ he proceeded to give me hell. He went on\nand on, not even stopping for a breath until he had run down and finished with ‘And don’t ever come\nback here again.’\n“After he had said that, I just stood there looking into his eyes for about five seconds, and then\nsaid softly and with genuine sincerity, because I meant it, ‘But Mr. S., I’m calling tonight as your\nfriend.’\n“Yesterday he bought a $250,000 endowment policy.”\n*\nSol Polk is popularly called the appliance king of Chicago. Starting with nothing, Sol Polk now sells\nmillions of dollars’ worth of appliances in a year in metropolitan Chicago.\nSol Polk credits a lot of his success to his attitude toward shoppers. “Customers,” says Mr. Polk,\n“should be treated like they are guests in my home.”\nIsn’t that thinking toward people? And isn’t it about the simplest success formula one can put to\nwork? Just treat customers like guests in your home.\nThis technique works outside the store too. Substitute the word employees for customers so that it\nreads “employees should be treated like guests in my home.” Give first-class treatment to \nyour\nemployees, and you get first-class cooperation, first-class output. Think first class about everyone\naround you, and you’ll receive first-class results in return.\nOne of the reviewers of an early version of this book is a close personal friend who owns his\nown business management consulting firm. When he read the above illustration, he commented,\n“That’s the positive result of liking and respecting people. Let me give you a personal experience of a\nfriend of mine which shows what happens if you don’t like and admire people.”\nHis experience has a big point. Here it is!\n“My firm obtained a contract to provide consulting services to a relatively small soft drink\nbottling concern. The contract was substantial. The client had little formal education. His business\nwas in bad shape, and in recent years he had made some very costly mistakes.\n“Three days after we had got the contract, an associate and I were driving out to his plant, which\nwas about forty-five minutes from our offices. To this day I don’t know how it started, but somehow\nwe began talking about the negative qualities of our client.\n“Before we realized it, we were talking about how his own stupidity had brought about the mess"

    "raw_text": "he was in, instead of discussing how we could best approach solving his problems.\n“I remember one remark I made which I thought particularly clever—‘The only thing holding up\nMr. F. is fat.’ My associate laughed and came up with an equally choice observation: ‘And that son of\nhis. Junior must be all of thirty-five but the only qualification he has for the job he’s holding is he\nspeaks English.’\n“The whole drive out, we talked about nothing else but what a weak-minded numbskull we had as\na client.\n“Well, the conference that afternoon was cold. Looking back, I think our client sensed somehow\nthe way we felt toward him. He must have thought: ‘These fellows think I’m stupid or something, and\nall they’re going to do for my money is give me some smooth-sounding talk.’\n“Two days later I got a two-sentence letter from this client. It said, ‘I’ve decided to cancel our\ncontract for your consulting services. If there is a charge for your services to date, please bill me.’\n“Printing ourselves with negative thoughts for only forty minutes cost us a contract. What made it\neven more painful was learning about a month later that this former client had contracted with an out-\nof-town firm for the professional assistance he needed.\n“We would never have lost him had we concentrated on his many fine qualities. And he has them.\nMost people do.”\nHere’s how you can have some fun and discover a basic success principle at the same time. For\nthe next two days listen in on as many conversations as you can. Note two things: which person in the\nconversation does the most talking and which person is the more successful.\nHundreds of my own little experiments have revealed this: \nThe person who does the most talking\nand the person who is the most successful are rarely the same person.\n Almost without exception,\nthe more successful the person, the more he practices \nconversation generosity\n, that is, he encourages\nthe other person to talk about himself, \nhis\n views, \nhis\n accomplishments, \nhis\n family, \nhis\n job, \nhis\nproblems.\nConversation generosity paves the way to greater success in two important ways:\n1. Conversation generosity wins friends.\n2. Conversation generosity helps you learn more about people.\nRemember this: the average person would rather talk about himself than anything else in this\nworld. When you give him the chance, he likes you for it. Conversation generosity is the easiest,\nsimplest, and surest way there is to win a friend.\nThe second benefit of conversation generosity, learning more about other people, is important,\ntoo. As we said in \nChapter 1\n, \npeople\n are what we study in our success lab. The more we can learn\nabout them, their thought processes, their strong and weak points, why they do what and as they do,\nthe better equipped we are to influence them effectively, in the way that we want.\nLet me illustrate.\nA large New York advertising agency, like all advertising agencies, specializes of course in\ntelling\n the public why it should buy the products it advertises. But this agency does something else,\ntoo. It requires its copywriters to spend one week each year behind counters so they can \nlisten\n to\nwhat people say about the products they promote. \nListening\n provides the clues these copywriters\nneed to write better, more effective ads."

    "raw_text": "Many progressive businesses conduct so-called terminal interviews with employees who are\nleaving. The reason is not to sell the employees on staying with the company but to find out why he is\nquitting. Then the company can bring about improvements in its employee relations. Listening pays\noff.\nListening pays off for the salesman, too. Often people think of a good salesman as a “good talker”\nor a “fast talker.” Sales \nmanagers, however, are not as impressed by a good talker as they are by a\ngood listener, a fellow who can ask questions and get desired answers.\nDon’t be a conversation hog. Listen, win friends, and learn.\nCourtesy practiced in every relationship with another person is the finest tranquilizer you can use.\nNo commercial preparation is one tenth as effective in relaxing you as doing little things for other\npeople. Thinking right toward people removes frustrations and stress. When you boil it all down, the\nbig cause of stress is negative feelings toward other people. So think positive toward people and\ndiscover how wonderful, really wonderful this world is.\nThe real test for thinking right toward people comes when things don’t go exactly the way we\nwant. How do you think when you’re passed up for a promotion? Or when you fail to win an office in\na club you belong to? Or when you’re criticized for the job you’ve done? Remember this: \nhow you\nthink when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.\nThe answer for thinking right toward people when things don’t go exactly our way comes from\nBenjamin Fairless, one of the century’s most outstanding persons. Mr. Fairless, who rose from very\nmodest circumstances to become chief executive of the United States Steel Corporation, said this\n(quoted in \nLife\n magazine, October 15, 1956):\n“It depends on how you look at things. For example, I never had a teacher I hated. Naturally I was\ndisciplined just like every other pupil, but I always figured it was my fault that the discipline was\nnecessary. I have also liked every boss I ever had. I always tried to please him and do more than he\nexpected if I possibly could, never less.\n“I have had some disappointments, times when I greatly wanted a promotion and somebody else\ngot it. But I never figured that I was the victim of ‘office politics’ or prejudice or bad judgment on the\nboss’s part. Instead of sulking or quitting in a huff, I reasoned things out. Obviously the other fellow\ndeserved the promotion more than I did. What could I do to make myself deserving of the next\nopportunity? At the same time I never got angry with myself for losing and never wasted any time\nberating myself.”\nRemember Benjamin Fairless when things go wrong. Just do two things:\n1. Ask yourself, “What can I do to make myself more deserving of the next opportunity?”\n2. Don’t waste time and energy being discouraged. Don’t berate yourself. Plan to win next time.\n\f\nIN A CAPSULE, PUT THESE PRINCIPLES TO WORK\n1. Make yourself lighter to lift. Be likable. Practice being the kind of person people like. This wins\ntheir support and puts fuel in your success-building program.\n2. Take the initiative in building friendships. Introduce yourself to others at every opportunity. Make\nsure you get the other person’s name straight, and make certain he gets your name straight too. Drop\na personal note to your new friends you want to get to know better.\n3. Accept human differences and limitations. Don’t expect anyone to be perfect. Remember, the other\nperson has a right to be different. And don’t be a reformer.\n4. Tune in Channel P, the Good Thoughts Station. Find qualities to like and admire in a person, not\nthings to dislike. And don’t let others prejudice your thinking about a third person. Think positive\nthoughts towards people—and get positive results.\n5. Practice conversation generosity. Be like successful people. Encourage others to talk. Let the other\nperson talk to you about \nhis\n views, \nhis\n opinions, \nhis\n accomplishments.\n6. Practice courtesy \nall\n the time. It makes other people feel better. It makes \nyou\n feel better too.\n7. Don’t blame others when you receive a setback. Remember, how you think when you lose\ndetermines how long it will be until you win.\n\f\n10"

    "raw_text": "GET THE ACTION HABIT\nHere’s something leaders in every field agree on: There is a shortage of top-flight, expertly qualified\npersons to fill key positions. There really is, as the saying goes, plenty of room at the top. As one\nexecutive explained, there are many almost-qualified people, but there is one success ingredient often\nmissing. That is the ability to get things done, to get results.\nEvery big job—whether it be operating a business, high-level selling, in science, the military, or\nthe government—requires a man who thinks action. Principal executives, looking for a key person,\ndemand answers to questions like “Will he \ndo\n the job?” “Will he \nfollow through\n?” “Is he a \nself-\nstarter\n?” “Can he get results, or is he just a talker?”\nAll these questions have one aim: to find out if the fellow is a man of action.\nExcellent ideas are not enough. An only fair idea acted upon, and developed, is 100 percent better\nthan a terrific idea that dies because it isn’t followed up.\nThe great self-made merchant John Wanamaker often said, “Nothing comes merely by thinking\nabout it.”\nThink of it. Everything we have in this world, from satellites to skyscrapers to baby food, is just\nan idea acted upon.\nAs you study people—both the successful and the just average—you find they fall into two\nclasses. The successful are active; we’ll call them activationists. The just average, the mediocre, the\nunsuccessful are passive. We’ll call them passivationists.\nWe can discover a success principle by studying both groups. Mr. Activationist is a doer. He\ntakes action, gets things done, follows through on ideas and plans. Mr. Passivationist is a “don’ter.”\nHe postpones doing things until he has proved he shouldn’t or can’t do them or until it’s too late.\nThe difference between Mr. Activationist and Mr. Passivationist shows through in countless little\nways. Mr. Activationist plans a vacation. He takes it. Mr. Passivationist plans a vacation. But he\npostpones it until “next” year. Mr. A. decides he should attend church regularly. He does. Mr. P thinks\nit’s a good idea to go to church regularly too, but he finds ways to postpone acquiring this new habit.\nMr. A. feels that he should drop a note to someone he knows to congratulate him on some\nachievement. He writes the note. Under the same circumstances, Mr. P. finds a good reason to put off\nwriting the note and it never gets written.\nThe difference shows up in big things too. Mr. A. wants to go into business for himself. He does.\nMr. P. also wants to go into business for himself, but he discovers just in the nick of time a “good”\nreason why he had better not. Mr. A., age forty, decides he wants to take up a new line of work. He\ndoes. The same idea occurs to Mr. P., but he debates himself out of doing anything about it.\nThe difference between Messrs. Activationist and Passivationist shows through in all forms of\nbehavior. Mr. A. gets the things done he wants done, and as by-products he gains confidence, a feeling\nof inner security, self-reliance, and more income. Mr. P. doesn’t get the things done he wants done\nbecause he won’t act. As by-products he loses confidence in himself, destroys his self-reliance, lives\nin mediocrity.\n\f\nMr. Activationist \ndoes.\n Mr. Passivationist \nis going to do but doesn’t.\nEveryone wants to be an activationist. So let’s get the action habit.\nA lot of passivationists got that way because they insisted on waiting until everything was 100\npercent favorable before they took action. Perfection is highly desirable. But nothing man-made or\nman-designed is, or can be, absolutely perfect. So to wait for the perfect set of conditions is to wait\nforever.\nBelow are three case histories that show how three persons reacted to “conditions.”\n\f\nCASE NO. 1: WHY G. N. HASN’T MARRIED\nMr. G. N. is now in his late thirties, is well educated, works as an accountant, and lives alone in\nChicago. G. N.’s big desire is to get married. He wants love, companionship, a home, children, the\nworks. G. N. has been close to marriage; once he was only one day away. But each time he has been\nnear marriage, he discovers something wrong with the girl he’s about to marry. (“Just in time, before I\nmade an awful mistake.”)\nOne instance stands out: Two years ago, G. N. thought he finally had met just the right girl. She\nwas attractive, pleasant, intelligent. But G. N. had to be absolutely sure that marriage \nwas the right\nthing. As they were discussing marriage plans one evening, the future Mrs. G. N. made a few remarks\nthat bothered G. N.\nSo, to make certain he was marrying the right girl, G. N. drew up a four-page document of\nstipulations she was to agree to before they got married. The document, neatly typed and looking very\nlegal, covered every segment of living G. N. could think of. There was one section on religion: what\nchurch they would go to, how often they would attend, how much they would donate. Another section\ncovered children: how many and when.\nIn detail, G. N. outlined the kind of friends they would have, his future wife’s employment status,\nwhere they would live, how their income would be spent. To finish the document, G. N. devoted half\na page to listing specific habits the girl must break or must acquire. This covered such habits as\nsmoking, drinking, makeup, entertainment, and so on.\nWhen G. N.’s prospective bride reviewed his ultimatum, she did what you would expect. She sent\nit back with a note saying, “The usual marriage clause, ‘for better or for worse,’ is good enough for\neveryone else and it’s good enough for me. The whole thing is off.”\nAs G. N. was relating his experience to me, he said worriedly, “Now, what was so wrong in\nwriting out this agreement? After all, marriage is a big step. You can’t be too careful.”\nBut G. N. was wrong. You \ncan\n be too careful, too cautious, not only in planning a marriage but in\nplanning anything in the world where things get done. The standards can be too high. G. N.’s approach\nto marriage was very much like his approach to his work, his savings, his friendships, everything\nelse.\nThe test of a successful person is not an ability to eliminate all problems before they arise, but to\nmeet and work out difficulties when they do arise. We must be willing to make an intelligent\ncompromise with perfection lest we wait forever before taking action. It’s still good advice to cross\nbridges as we come to them."

    "raw_text": "CASE NO. 2: WHY J. M. LIVES IN A NEW HOME\nIn every big decision, the mind battles with itself—to act or not to act, to do or not to do. Here’s how\none young fellow elected to act and reaped big rewards.\nJ. M.’s situation is similar to that of a million other young men. He is in his twenties, has a wife\nand child, and still has only a modest income.\nMr. and Mrs. J. M. lived in a small apartment. Both wanted a new home. They wanted the\nadvantage of more space, cleaner surroundings, a place for the youngster to play, and a chance to\nbuild up equity in their own property.\nBut there was a hitch to buying a new home—the down payment. One day as J. M. was writing\nnext month’s rent check he became very disgusted with himself. He observed that the rent payment\nwas as much as monthly payments on a new home.\nJ. M. called his wife and said, “How would you like to buy a new home next week?” “What’s got\ninto you?” she asked. “Why make jokes? You know we can’t. We haven’t even got the money for the\ndown payment.”\nBut J. M. was determined. “There are hundreds of thousands of couples like us who are going to\nbuy a new home ‘someday,’ but only about half of them ever do. Something always \ncomes up to stop\nthem. We’re going to buy a home. I don’t know yet how we’ll raise the down payment, but we will.”\nWell, the next week they found a house they both liked, quite unpretentious but nice, for $1,200\ndown. Now the obstacle was to find a way to raise $1,200. J. M. knew he couldn’t borrow it through\nthe usual channels, for this would encumber his credit so that he couldn’t get a mortgage for the sale\nprice.\nWhere there’s a will there’s always a way. Suddenly, J. M. got a brainstorm: Why not contact the\nbuilder and work out a private loan arrangement for $1,200? This J. M. did. At first, the builder was\ncold to the idea, but J. M. persisted. Finally, it was agreed. The builder would, in effect, advance J.\nM. the $1,200, to be repaid at $100 a month plus interest.\nNow all J. M. had to do was to “find” $100 a month. Mr. and Mrs. J. M. sharpened their pencils\nand figured out a way to cut expenditures $25 a month. But that still left $75, which J. M. would have\nto raise each month.\nThen J. M. got another idea. The next morning he went in to see his boss. He explained to his\nemployer what he was doing. His boss was glad to learn that J. M. was going to buy a new home.\nThen J. M. said, “Look, Mr. T., to work this deal out, I’ve got to earn at least $75 more each\nmonth. Now, I know,” J. M. continued, “you’ll give me a raise when you feel that I deserve it. What I\nwant now is just a chance to earn more money. There are some things around here that could best be\ndone on weekends. Will you make it possible for me to work then?”\nThe employer was impressed with J. M.’s sincerity and ambition. He proposed a way for J. M. to\nwork ten extra hours \neach weekend, and Mr. and Mrs. J. M. moved into their new home.\n1. The resolution to take action ignited J. M.’s mind to think of ways to accomplish his goal.\n2. J. M. gained tremendously in new confidence. It will be much easier for him to take action in other\nmajor situations.\n3. J. M. provided his wife and child the living standard they deserved. Had he waited, postponed\nbuying the house until conditions were perfect, there is a real possibility they never would have\nowned a home of their own.\n\f\n\n\f\nCASE NO. 3: C. D. WANTED TO START HIS OWN BUSINESS, BUT . . .\nMr. C. D. represents another case of what happens to big ideas when one waits until conditions are\nperfect before taking action on those ideas.\nShortly after World War II, C. D. got a job with the Customs Division of the U.S. Post Office\nDepartment. He liked his work, but after five years he became dissatisfied with the confinement,\nregular hours, low pay, and the seniority system with its relatively narrow chances for advancement.\nThen he got an idea. He had learned a great deal about what it takes to be a successful importer.\nWhy not set himself up in the business of importing low-cost gift items and toys? C. D. knew many\nsuccessful importers who didn’t have his knowledge of the ins and outs of this business.\nIt’s been ten years now since C. D. decided he wanted to go into business for himself. But today,\nhe’s still working for the Customs Office.\nWhy? Well, every time C. D. was just about ready to cut loose on his own, something happened\nthat stopped him from taking action. Lack of money, economic recession, new baby, need for\ntemporary security, trade restrictions, and more excuses all served as reasons for waiting, for\npostponing.\nThe real truth is that C. D. let himself develop into a passivationist. He wanted conditions to be\nperfect before he took action. Since conditions were never perfect, C. D. never took action.\nHere are two things to do to help you avoid the costly mistake of waiting until conditions are\nperfect before you act:\n1. Expect future obstacles and difficulties. Every venture presents risks, problems, and uncertainties.\nLet’s suppose you wanted to drive your car from Chicago to Los Angeles, but you insisted on\nwaiting until you had absolute assurance that there would be no detours, no motor trouble, no bad\nweather, no drunken drivers, no risk of any kind. When would you start? \nNever!\n In planning your\ntrip to Los Angeles it makes sense to map your route, check your car, in other ways to eliminate as\nmuch risk as possible before you start. But you can’t eliminate all risks.\n2. Meet problems and obstacles as they arise. The test of a successful person is not the ability to\neliminate all problems before he takes action, but rather the ability to find solutions to difficulties\nwhen he encounters them. In business, \nmarriage, or in any activity, cross bridges when you come to\nthem.\nWe can’t buy an insurance policy against all problems.\nMake up your mind to do something about your ideas. Five or six years ago a very capable\nprofessor told me of his plans for writing a book, a biography of a controversial personality of a few\ndecades ago. His ideas were more than interesting; they were alive, fascinating. The professor knew\nwhat he wanted to say, and he had the skill and energy to say it. The project was destined to reward\nhim with much inner satisfaction, prestige, and money.\nLast spring I saw my friend again, and I innocently asked him whether the book was about\nfinished. (This was a blunder; it opened up an old wound.)\nNo, he hadn’t written the book. He struggled with himself for a moment as if he were debating\nwith himself whether to explain why. Finally he explained that he had been too busy, he had more\n“responsibilities” and just couldn’t get to it.\nIn reality, what the professor had done was to bury the idea deep in his mental graveyard. He let\n\f\nhis mind grow negative thoughts. He visualized the tremendous work and sacrifices that would be\ninvolved. He saw all sorts of reasons why the project would fail.\nIdeas are important. Let’s make no mistake about that. We \nmust\n have ideas to create and improve\nanything. Success shuns the man who lacks ideas.\nBut let’s make no mistakes about this point either. Ideas in themselves are not enough. That idea\nfor getting more business, for simplifying work procedures, is of value only when it is acted upon.\nEvery day thousands of people bury good ideas because they are afraid to act on them.\nAnd afterward, the ghosts of those ideas come back to haunt them.\nPut these two thoughts deep in your mind. First, give your ideas value by acting on them.\nRegardless of how good the idea, unless you do something with it, you gain nothing.\nSecond, act on your ideas and gain mind tranquillity. Someone once said that the saddest words of\ntongue or pen are these: it might have been. Every day you hear someone saying something like “Had I\ngone into business seven years ago, I’d sure be sitting pretty now.” Or “I had a hunch it would work\nout like that. I wish I had done something about it.” A good idea if not acted upon produces terrible\npsychological pain. But a good idea acted upon brings enormous mental satisfaction.\nGot a good idea? Then do something about it.\nUse action to cure fear and gain confidence.\n Here’s something to remember. Action feeds and\nstrengthens confidence; inaction in all forms feeds fear. To fight fear, \nact.\n To increase fear—wait, put\noff, postpone.\nOnce I heard a young paratrooper instructor explain, “The jump really isn’t so bad. It’s the\nwaiting to jump that gets a fellow. On the trip to the jump site I always try to make the time pass\nquickly for the men. It’s happened more than once that a trainee thought too much about what may\nhappen and panicked. If we can’t get him to jump the next trip, he’s through as a paratrooper. Instead\nof gaining confidence, the longer he postpones the jump, the more scared he gets.”\nWaiting even makes the experts nervous. \nTime\n magazine reported that Edward R. Murrow, the\nnation’s top newscaster, \nperspires and is on edge just before he telecasts. But once he’s in action, fear\ndisappears. Many veteran actors experience the same sensation. They agree that the only cure for\nstage fright is action. Getting right out there before the audience is the cure for dread, worry, fear.\nAction cures fear. One evening we were visiting in a friend’s home when their five-year-old boy,\nwho had been put to bed thirty minutes before, cried out. The youngster had been overstimulated by a\nscience fiction film and was afraid the little green monsters were going to enter his room and kidnap\nhim. I was intrigued by the way the boy’s father relieved the lad’s worry. He didn’t say, “Don’t\nworry, son, nothing is going to get you. Go back to sleep.” Instead he took positive action. He made\nquite a show for the boy by inspecting the windows to be sure they were tight. Then he picked up one\nof the boy’s plastic guns and put it on a table beside his bed and said, “Billy, here’s a gun for you just\nin case.” The little fellow had a look of complete relief. Four minutes later he was fast asleep.\nMany physicians give neutral, harmless “medication” to people who insist they’ve got to have\nsomething to make them sleep. To lots of folks the act of swallowing a pill, even though (unknown to\nthem) the pill has no medication, makes them feel better.\nIt’s perfectly natural to experience fear in one of many forms. But the usual methods of combating\nit simply don’t work. I’ve been with many salesmen who tried to cure fear, which creeps up on even\nthe most experienced of them at times, by going around the block a few times or drinking extra coffee.\nBut these things don’t get results. The way to combat that kind of fear—yes, any kind of fear—yes,\nany\n kind of fear—is \naction.\nDread making a certain phone call? Make it, and dread disappears. Put it off, and it will get\n\f\nharder and harder to make.\nDread going to a doctor for a checkup? Go, and your worry vanishes. Chances are nothing serious\nis wrong with you, and if there is, you know where you stand. Put off that checkup, and you feed your\nfear until it may grow so strong that you actually are sick.\nDread discussing a problem with your superior? Discuss it, and discover how those worries are\nconquered.\nBuild \nconfidence.\n Destroy \nfear\n through \naction."

    "raw_text": "START YOUR MENTAL ENGINE—MECHANICALLY\nAn aspiring young writer who wasn’t experiencing success made this confession: “My trouble is,\nwhole days and weeks pass that I can’t get a thing written.\n“You see,” he remarked, “writing is creative. You’ve got to be inspired. Your spirit must move\nyou.”\nTrue, writing is creative, but here’s how another creative man, also a writer, explained his\n“secret” for producing quantities of successful material.\n“I use a ‘mind force’ technique,” he began. “I’ve got deadlines to meet, and I can’t wait for my\nspirit to move me. I’ve got to move my spirit. Here’s how my method works. I make myself sit down\nat my desk. Then I pick up a pencil and go through mechanical motions of writing. I put down\nanything. I doodle. I get my fingers and arm in motion, and sooner or later, without my being\nconscious of it, my mind gets on the right track.\n“Sometimes, of course, I get ideas out of the blue when I’m not trying to write,” he went on, “but\nthese are just bonuses. Most of the good ideas come from just getting to work.”\nAction must precede action. That’s a law of nature. Nothing starts itself, not even the dozens of\nmechanical gadgets we use daily.\nYour home is heated automatically, but you must select (take action) the temperature you want.\nYour car shifts gears automatically only after you have set the right lever. The same principle applies\nto mind action. You get your mind in gear to make it produce for you.\nA young branch sales manager for a door-to-door sales organization explained how he trained his\nsales force the “mechanical way” to start each day earlier and more successfully.\n“There’s a tremendous resistance to the door-to-door salesman, as any one who has ever sold\nhouse to house knows,” he commented. “And it’s hard, even for the veteran salesman, to make that\nfirst call in the morning. He knows the odds are pretty good that he’ll get some pretty rough treatment\nbefore the day is over. So it’s natural for him to put off getting started in the morning. He’ll drink a\ncouple of extra cups of coffee, maybe cruise around the neighborhood awhile or do a dozen little\nthings to postpone that first call.\n“I train each new man this way. I explain to him that the only way to start is to start. Don’t\ndeliberate. Don’t postpone getting started. Do this: Just park your car. Get your sample case. Walk to\nthe door. Ring the bell. Smile. Say ‘Good morning,’ and make your presentation, all mechanically,\nwithout a lot of conscious thought. Start making calls this way and you break the ice. By the second or\nthird call, your mind is sharp and your presentations become effective.”\nA humorist once said the most difficult problem in life was getting out of a warm bed into a cold\nroom. And he had a point. \nThe longer you lie there and think how unpleasant it will be to get up, the\nmore difficult it becomes. Even in such a simple operation as this, mechanical action, just throwing\noff the covers and putting your feet on the floor, defeats dread.\nThe point is clear. People who get things done in this world don’t wait for the spirit to move\nthem; they move the spirit.\nTry these two exercises:\n1. Use the mechanical way to accomplish simple but sometimes unpleasant business and household\nchores. Rather than think about the unpleasant features of the task, jump right in and get going\nwithout a lot of deliberation.\n\f\nPerhaps the most unpleasant household task to most women is washing dishes. My mother is no\nexception. But she has mastered a mechanical approach to dispensing with this task quickly, so she\ncan return to things she likes to do.\nAs she leaves the table, she always mechanically picks up several dishes and, without thinking\nabout the task ahead, just gets started. In just a few minutes she is through. Doesn’t this beat stacking\ndishes and dreading the unpleasant inevitable?\nDo this today: Pick the one thing you like to do least. Then, without letting yourself deliberate on\nor dread the task, \ndo\n it. That’s the most efficient way to handle chores.\n2. Next, use the mechanical way to create ideas, map out plans, solve problems, and do other work\nthat requires top mental performance. Rather than wait for the spirit to move you, sit down and\nmove your spirit.\nHere’s a special technique guaranteed to help you: \nUse a pencil and paper.\n A simple pencil is the\ngreatest concentration tool money can buy. If I had to choose between an ultrafancy, deeply carpeted,\nbeautifully decorated, soundproof office and a pencil and paper, I’d choose the pencil and paper\nevery time. With a pencil and paper you can tie your mind to a problem.\nWhen you write a thought on paper, your full attention is automatically focused on that thought.\nThat’s because the mind is not designed to think one thought and write another at the same time. And\nwhen you write on paper, you “write” on your mind, too. Tests prove conclusively that you remember\nsomething much longer and much more exactly if you write the thought on paper.\nAnd once you master the pencil-and-paper technique for concentration, you can think in noisy or\nother distracting situations. When you want to think, start writing or doodling or diagramming. It’s an\nexcellent way to move your spirit.\n*\nNow\n is the magic word of success. \nTomorrow, next week, later, sometime, someday\n often as not are\nsynonyms for the failure word, \nnever.\n Lots of good dreams never come true because we say, “I’ll start\nsomeday,” when we should say, “I’ll start now, \nright\n now.”\nTake one example, saving money. Just about everybody agrees that saving money is a good idea.\nBut just because it’s a good idea doesn’t mean many folks follow an organized savings and investment\nprogram. Many people have intentions to save, but only relatively few \nact\n on these intentions.\nHere’s how one young couple got into gear with a regular wealth accumulation program. Bill’s\ntake-home income was \n$1,000 a month, but he and his wife, Janet, spent $1,000 each month too. Both\nwanted to save, but there were always reasons why they felt they couldn’t begin. For years they had\npromised themselves, “We’ll start when we get a raise,” “When we’ve caught up with our\ninstallments,” “When we’re over the hump,” “next month,” “next year.”\nFinally Janet got disgusted with their failure to save. She said to Bill, “Look, do we want to save\nor don’t we?” He replied, “Of course we do, but you know as well as I we can’t put aside anything\nnow.”\nBut for once Janet was in a do-or-die mood. “We’ve been telling ourselves for years we’re going\nto start a savings program. We don’t save because we think we can’t. Now let’s start thinking we \ncan.\nI saw an ad today that shows if we’d save just $100 a month, in fifteen years, we’d have $18,000 plus\n$6,600 accumulated interest. The ad also said it’s easier to spend what’s left over after savings than it\n\f\nis to save what’s left over after spending. If you’re game, let’s start with 10 percent of your pay and\nlet’s save off the top. We may eat crackers and milk before the month’s up, but if we have to, we\nwill.”\nBill and Janet were cramped for a few months, but soon they were adjusted to their new budget.\nNow they feel it’s just as much fun to “spend” money on savings as it is to spend it on something else.\nWant to write a note to a friend? Do it now. Got an idea you think would help your business?\nPresent it now. Live the advice of Benjamin Franklin: “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do\ntoday.”\nRemember, thinking in terms of \nnow\n gets things accomplished. \nBut thinking in terms of \nsomeday\nor \nsometime\n usually means failure.\n*\nOne day I stopped in to see an old business friend. She had just returned from a conference with\nseveral of her executives. The moment I looked at her, I could tell there was something she wanted to\nget off her chest. She had the look of a woman who had suffered real disappointment.\n“You know,” she said, “I called that conference this morning because I wanted some help on a\nproposed policy change. But what kind of help did I get? I had six men in there, and only one of them\nhad anything to contribute. Two others talked, but what they said was just an echo of what I had said.\nIt was like talking with a bunch of vegetables. I confess it’s hard for me to find out what those fellows\nthink.\n“Really,” she went on, “you’d think those fellows would speak up and let me know what they\nthink. After all, it directly affects each of them.”\nMy friend didn’t get help in the conference. But had you roamed the hall after the meeting broke\nup, you’d have heard her junior associates making remarks like “I felt like saying . . . ,” “Why didn’t\nsomeone suggest . . . ,” “I don’t think . . . ,” “We ought to go ahead . . .”\nSo often the vegetables, those who have nothing to say in the conference room, are full of talk\nafter the meeting, when what they’ve got to say won’t make any difference. They’re suddenly full of\nlife when it’s too late.\nBusiness executives want comment. The fellow who hides his light under a bushel hurts himself.\nGet the “speak up” habit. Each time you speak up, you \nstrengthen yourself. Come forward with\nyour constructive ideas.\nWe all know how many college students prepare their assignments. With fine intentions, Joe\nCollege sets aside a whole evening for some concentrated study. Here is a general pattern of how, too\noften, the evening is spent.\nJoe’s ready to begin studying at 7 \nP.M\n., but his dinner seems just a bit heavy, so he decides to get\nin a little TV. A little turns out to be an hour’s worth since the program was pretty good. At 8 \nP.M\n. he\nsits down at his desk but gets right back up because he just remembered he promised to call his girl.\nThis shoots another forty minutes (he hadn’t talked to her all day). An incoming call takes another\ntwenty minutes. On his way back to his desk Joe is drawn into a Ping-Pong game. Another hour gone.\nThe Ping-Pong makes him feel sweaty, so he takes a shower. Next he needs a snack. The combined\neffect of the Ping-Pong and the shower have made him hungry.\nAnd so the evening planned with good intentions drifts away. Finally, at 1 \nA.M\n., he opens the book,\nbut he’s too sleepy to absorb the subject. Finally he surrenders completely. Next morning he tells the\nprofessor, “I hope you give me a break. I studied till 2 \nA.M\n. for this exam.”"

    "raw_text": "Joe College didn’t get into action because he spent too much time getting ready to get into action.\nAnd Joe College isn’t alone in being a victim of “overpreparedness.” Joe Salesman, Joe Executive,\nJoe Professional Worker, Josephine Housewife—they all often try to build strength and get ready with\noffice chats, coffee breaks, sharpening pencils, reading, personal business, getting the desk cleared\noff, TV, and dozens of other little escape devices.\nBut there’s a way to break this habit. Tell yourself, “I’m in condition \nright now\n to begin. I can’t\ngain a thing by putting it off. I’ll use the ‘get ready’ time and energy to get going instead.”\n“What we want more than anything else in our business,” an executive in a machine tool company\nsaid in an address to a group of sales executives, “is more people who get sound ideas and then push\nthem through. There’s not one job in our production and marketing setup that can’t be done better, a lot\nbetter. I don’t want to infer that we’re not doing a good job now. We are. But like all progressive\ncompanies, we need new products, new markets, new and more efficient ways of doing things. We\ndepend on people with initiative. They’re the ball carriers on our team.”\nInitiative is a special kind of action. It’s doing something worthwhile without being told to do it.\nThe person with initiative has a standing invitation to join the high income brackets in every business\nand profession.\nThe director of marketing research in a medium-sized drug manufacturing firm told me how he got\nto be a director of marketing research. It’s a good lesson in the power of initiative.\n“Five years ago I got an idea,” he told me. “I was working then as a sort of missionary salesman,\ncalling on wholesalers. I discovered that one thing we lacked was facts about the consumers we\nwanted to buy our drug line. I talked about the need for market research to everyone here. At first I got\nonly deaf ears because management couldn’t see the need for it.\n“I was pretty much obsessed with the idea of marketing research in our company, so I sort of took\nthe bull by the horns. I asked and got permission to prepare a monthly report on ‘Facts of Drug\nMarketing.’ I collected information from every source I \ncould find. I kept on with this, and pretty soon\nmanagement, and the other salesmen, found themselves really interested in what I was doing. Just one\nyear after I started crusading for research, I was relieved of my regular duties and asked to\nconcentrate on developing my ideas.\n“The rest,” he continued, “was just natural development. Now I’ve got two assistants, a secretary,\nand about three times the yearly income I had five years ago.”\nHere are two special exercises for developing the initiative habit:\n1. Be a crusader. When you see something that you believe ought to be done, pick up the ball and run.\nA new subdivision not far from where I live was about two-thirds built when expansion came\nalmost to a standstill. A few families with a don’t-care attitude had moved in. This prompted\nseveral of the finest families in the area to sell their homes (at a loss) and move on. As so often\nhappens, the do-care families caught the don’t-care attitude from their don’t-care neighbors—\neveryone, that is, except Harry L. Harry did care, and he decided to crusade for a fine\nneighborhood.\nHarry began by calling together some friends. He pointed out that this subdivision had\ntremendous potential but that something must be done now or the area would soon be a strictly\nsecond-class neighborhood. Harry’s enthusiasm and initiative quickly won support. Soon there\nwere clean-up-the-vacant-lots projects. Garden clubs were organized, a massive tree-planting\nproject was started. A playground was built for the youngsters. A community \nswimming pool was\nconstructed. The don’t-care families became eager supporters. The whole subdivision took on\n\f\nnew life and new sparkle. It’s really a pleasure now to drive through that community. It shows\nwhat a crusader can do.\nDo you feel your business should develop a new department, make a new product, or in some\nother way expand? Well, then, crusade for it. Feel your church needs a new building? Crusade for\nit. Would you like your children’s school to have better equipment? Crusade and get it for them.\nAnd you can bank on this: while crusades may start out as one-man crusades, if the idea behind\nthe enterprise is good, soon you’ll have lots of support.\nBe an activationist and crusade.\n2. Be a volunteer. Each of us has been in situations in which we wanted to volunteer for some activity\nbut didn’t. Why? Because of fear. Not fear that we couldn’t accomplish the task, but rather fear of\nwhat our associates would say. The fear of being laughed at, of being called an eager beaver, of\nbeing accused of bucking for a raise holds many people back.\nIt’s natural to want to belong, to be accepted, to have group approval. But ask yourself,\n“Which group do I want to have accept me: the group that laughs because it is secretly jealous or\nthe group that is making progress by doing things?” The right choice is obvious.\nThe volunteer stands out. He receives special attention. Most important of all, he gives himself\nan opportunity to \nshow he has special ability and ambition by volunteering. By all means,\nvolunteer for those special assignments.\nThink about the leaders you know in business, the military, your community. Do they fit the\ndescription of activationist or would you say they are passivationists?\nTen times out of ten they’re activationists, people who do things. The fellow who stands on the\nsidelines, who holds off, who is passive, does not lead. But the doer, the fellow who thinks action,\nfinds others want to follow him.\nPeople place confidence in the fellow who acts. They naturally assume he knows what he is\ndoing.\nI’ve never heard anyone complimented and praised because “he doesn’t disturb anyone,” “he\ndoesn’t take action,” or “he waits until he’s told what to do.”\nHave you?\n\f\nGROW THE ACTION HABIT\nPractice these key points:\n1. Be an activationist. Be someone who does things. Be a doer, not a don’t-er.\n2. Don’t wait until conditions are perfect. They never will be. Expect future obstacles and difficulties\nand solve them as they arise.\n3. Remember, ideas alone won’t bring success. Ideas have value only when you act upon them.\n4. Use action to cure fear and gain confidence. Do what you fear, and fear disappears. Just try it and\nsee.\n5. Start your mental engine mechanically. Don’t wait for the spirit to move you. \nTake action\n, dig in,\nand you move the spirit.\n6. Think in terms of \nnow. Tomorrow, next week, later\n, and similar words often are synonymous with\nthe failure word, \nnever.\n Be an “I’m starting right now” kind of person.\n7. Get down to business—\npronto.\n Don’t waste time getting ready to act. Start acting instead.\n8. Seize the initiative. Be a crusader. Pick up the ball and run. Be a volunteer. Show that you have the\nability and ambition to \ndo.\nGet in gear and go!\n\f\n11"

    "raw_text": "HOW TO TURN DEFEAT INTO VICTORY\nSocial workers and others who work on skid row find many differences in age, religious faith,\neducation, and background among the tragic souls who have dropped into America’s gutters. Some of\nthese citizens are surprisingly young. Others are old. A sprinkling are college graduates; a few have\nessentially no formal education. Some are married; others are not. But the people on skid row do\nhave something in common: each one is defeated, whipped, beaten. Each one has encountered\nsituations that conquered him. Each is eager, even anxious, to tell you about the situation that wrecked\nhim, about his own private Waterloo.\nThese situations cover the waterfront of human experience from “My wife ran out on me” to “I\nlost everything I had and had no place else to go” to “I did a couple of things that made me a social\noutcast, so I came down here.”\nWhen we move up from skid row into the dominion of Mr. and Mrs. Average American, we see\nobvious differences in living habits. But again we discover that Mr. Mediocre gives essentially the\nsame reasons to explain his mediocrity as Mr. Skid Row gave to explain his complete collapse.\nInside, Mr. Mediocre feels \ndefeated. He has unhealed wounds suffered in situations that beat him.\nNow he is supercautious. He plods along, ducking the thrill of living victoriously, discontented with\nhimself. He feels beaten but tries hard to endure the sentence of mediocrity that “fate” has handed\nhim.\nHe, too, has surrendered to defeat, but in a reasonably clean, socially “accepted” way.\nNow, when we climb upstairs into the uncrowded world of success, we again discover people\nfrom every possible background. Corporate executives, leading ministers, government officials, top\nmen in every field, we discover, come from poor homes, rich homes, broken homes, cotton patches,\ncornfields, and slums. These people, who lead every branch of our society, have experienced every\ntough situation you can describe.\nIt is possible to match every Mr. Skid Row with a Mr. Mediocre and a Mr. Success on every\nscore—age, intelligence, background, nationality, you name it—with one exception. The one thing you\ncan’t match them on is their response to defeat.\nWhen the fellow we call Mr. Skid Row got knocked down, he failed to get up again. He just lay\nthere, splattered out. Mr. Mediocre got up to his knees, but he crawled away, and when out of sight,\nran in the opposite direction so he’d be sure never to take a beating again.\nBut Mr. Success reacted differently when he got knocked down. He bounced up, learned a lesson,\nforgot the beating, and moved upward.\nOne of my closest friends is an exceptionally successful management consultant. When you walk\ninto his office, you feel that you are really “uptown.” The fine furniture, the carpeting, \nthe busy\npeople, the important clients, all tell you his company is prosperous.\nA cynic might say, “It must have taken a real con man to put across an operation like this.” But the\ncynic would be wrong. It didn’t take a con man. And it didn’t take a brilliant man or a wealthy man or\na lucky man. All (and I hesitate to use the word \nall\n because all means so much sometimes) \nall it took\n\f\nwas a persistent man who never thought he was defeated.\nBehind this prosperous and respected company is the story of a man fighting, battling his way\nupward: losing ten years’ savings in his first six months in business, living in his office several\nmonths because he lacked money to pay rent on an apartment, turning down numerous “good” jobs\nbecause he wanted more to stay with his idea and make it work, hearing prospects for his service say\nno a hundred times as often as they said yes . . .\nDuring the seven unbelievably hard years it took him to succeed, I never heard my friend\ncomplain once. He’d explain, “Dave, I’m learning. This is competitive business, and because it’s\nintangible, it’s hard to sell. But I’m learning how.”\nAnd he did.\nOnce I told my friend that this experience must be taking a lot out of him. But he replied, “No, it’s\nnot taking something out of me; it’s putting something into me instead.”\nCheck the lives of the people in \nWho’s Who in America\n, and you’ll find that those who have\nsucceeded in a major way have been pounded by losing situations. Each person in this elite corps of\nsuccessful men has encountered opposition, discouragement, setbacks, personal misfortune.\nRead the biographies and autobiographies of great people, and again you discover that each of\nthese people could have surrendered to setbacks many times.\nOr do this. Learn the background of the president of your company or the mayor of your city, or\nselect any person you consider a real success. When you probe, you’ll discover the individual has\novercome big, real obstacles.\nIt is \nnot\n possible to win high-level success without meeting opposition, hardship, and setback.\nBut it \nis\n possible to use setbacks to propel you forward. Let’s see how.\nI saw some commercial airline statistics recently showing that there is only one fatality per 10\nbillion miles flown. Air travel is a magnificently safe way to go these days. Unfortunately, air\naccidents still occur. But when they do, the Civil Aviation Administration is on the scene quickly to\nfind out what caused the crash. Fragments of metal are picked up from miles around and pieced\ntogether. A variety of experts reconstruct what probably happened. Witnesses and survivors are\ninterviewed. The investigation goes on for weeks, months, until the question “What caused this\ncrash?” is answered.\nOnce the CAA has the answer, immediate steps are taken to prevent a similar accident from\nhappening again. If the crash was caused by a structural defect, other planes of that type must have\nthat defect corrected. Or if certain instruments are found faulty, corrections must be made. Literally\nhundreds of safety devices on modern aircraft have resulted from CAA investigations.\nThe CAA studies setbacks to pave the way to safer air travel. And it’s obvious that their efforts\npay off.\nDoctors use setbacks to pave the way to better health and \nlonger life. Often when a patient dies\nfor an uncertain reason, doctors perform a postmortem to find out why. In this way they learn more\nabout the functioning of the human body, and lives of other people are saved.\nA sales executive friend of mine devotes one entire sales meeting a month to helping his salesmen\ndiscover why they lost important sales. The lost sale is reconstructed and carefully examined. In this\nway, the salesman learns how to avoid losing similar sales in the future.\nThe football coach who wins more games than he loses goes over the details of each game with\nhis team to point out their mistakes. Some coaches have movies made of each game so the team can\nliterally see its bad moves. The purpose: to play the next game better.\nCAA officials, successful sales executives, physicians, football coaches, and professionals in\n\f\nevery field follow this success principle: \nsalvage something from every setback.\nWhen a setback hits us personally, our first impulse is often to become so emotionally upset that\nwe fail to learn the lesson.\nProfessors know that a student’s reaction to a failing grade provides a clue to his success\npotential. When I was a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit some years ago, I had no\nchoice but to turn in a failing grade for a graduating senior. This was a real blow to the student. He\nhad already made graduation plans, and canceling was embarrassing. He was left with two\nalternatives: retake and pass the course and receive his degree at a later graduation, or quit school\nwithout earning a degree.\nI expected that the student would be disappointed, perhaps even somewhat belligerent, when he\nlearned of his setback. I \nwas right. After I explained that his work was far below passing standards,\nthe student admitted that he hadn’t put forth a serious effort in the course.\n“But,” he continued, “my past record is at least average. Can’t you consider that?”\nI pointed out that I could not, because we measure performance one course at a time. I added that\nrigid academic codes prohibited changing grades for any reason other than an honest mistake on the\npart of the professor.\nThen the student, realizing that all avenues toward a grade change were closed, became quite\nangry. “Professor,” he said, “I could name fifty people in this city who’ve succeeded in a big way\nwithout taking this course or even knowing about it. What’s so blasted important about this course?\nWhy should a few bad marks in one course keep me from getting my degree?\n“Thank God,” he added, “they don’t look at things on the ‘outside’ like you professors do.”\nAfter that remark I paused for about forty-five seconds. (I’ve learned that when you’ve been\nsniped at, one fine way to prevent a war of words is to take a long pause before answering.)\nThen I said to my student friend, “Much of what you say is true. There are many, many highly\nsuccessful people who know absolutely nothing about the subject matter in this course. And it is\npossible for you to win success without this knowledge. In the total scheme of life, this course content\nwon’t make or break you. But your attitude toward this course may.”\n“What do you mean by that?” he asked.\n“Just this,” I answered. “Outside they grade you just as we grade you. What counts there just as\nwhat counts here is doing \nthe job. Outside they won’t promote you or pay you more for doing second-\nclass work.”\nI paused again to make certain the point got through.\nThen I said, “May I make a suggestion? You’re highly disappointed now. I can appreciate how\nyou feel. And I don’t think any less of you if you’re a little sore at me. But look at this experience\npositively. There’s a tremendously important lesson here: if you don’t produce, you don’t get where\nyou want to go. Learn this lesson, and five years from now you’ll regard it as one of the most\nprofitable lessons you learned in all the time you invested here.”\nI was glad when I learned a few days later that this student had reenrolled for the course. This\ntime he passed with flying colors. Afterward, he made a special call to see me to let me know how\nmuch he had appreciated our earlier discussion.\n“I learned something from flunking your course the first time,” he said. “It may sound odd, but you\nknow, Professor, now I’m glad I did not pass the first time.”\nWe can turn setbacks into victories. Find the lesson, apply it, and then look back on defeat and\nsmile.\nMoviegoers will never forget the great Lionel Barrymore. In 1936 Mr. Barrymore broke his hip."

    "raw_text": "The fracture never healed. Most people thought Mr. Barrymore was finished. But not Mr. Barrymore.\nHe used the setback to pave the way to even greater acting success. For the next eighteen years,\ndespite pain that never abated, he played dozens of successful roles in a wheelchair.\nOn March 15, 1945, W. Colvin Williams was walking behind a tank in France. The tank hit a\nmine, exploded, and permanently blinded Mr. Williams.\nBut this didn’t stop Mr. Williams from pursuing his goal to be a minister and counselor. When he\nwas graduated from college (and with honors too), Mr. Williams said he thought his blindness “will\nactually be an asset in my career. I can never judge by appearances. Therefore, I can always give a\nperson a second chance. My blindness keeps me from cutting myself off from a person because of the\nway he looks. I want to be the kind of person to whom anyone can come and feel secure, to express\nhimself.”\nIsn’t that a magnificent living example of cruel, bitter defeat being turned into victory?\nDefeat is \nonly\n a state of mind, and nothing more.\nOne of my friends, who is a substantial and successful investor in the stock market, carefully\nappraises each investment decision in the light of his past experiences. One time he told me, “When I\nfirst started investing fifteen years ago, I really got singed a few times. Like most amateurs, I wanted\nto get rich quick. Instead I got broke quick. But that didn’t stop me. I knew the basic strengths of the\neconomy and that, over the long pull, well-selected stocks are about the best investment anybody can\nmake.\n“So I just regarded those first bad investments as part of the cost of my education,” he laughed.\nOn the other hand, I know a number of people who, having made an unwise investment or two, are\nstrictly “antisecurities.” Rather than analyze their mistakes and join in a good thing, they reach the\ncompletely false conclusion that investing in common stocks is just a form of gambling and sooner or\nlater everybody loses.\nDecide right now to salvage something from every setback. Next time things seem to go wrong on\nthe job or at home, calm down and find out what caused the trouble. This is the way to avoid making\nthe same error twice.\nBeing licked is valuable if we learn from it.\n*\nWe human beings are curious creatures. We’re quick to accept full credit for our victories. When we\nwin, we want the world to know about it. It’s natural to want others to look at you and say, “There\ngoes the fellow who did such and such.”\nBut human beings are equally quick to blame someone else for each setback. It’s natural for\nsalesmen to blame customers when sales are lost. It’s natural for executives to blame employees or\nother executives when things get out of gear. It’s natural for husbands to blame wives and wives to\nblame husbands for quarrels and family problems.\nIt is true that in this complex world others may trip us. But it is also true that more often than not\nwe trip ourselves. We lose because of personal inadequacy, some personal mistake.\nCondition yourself for success this way. Remind yourself that you want to be as nearly perfect as\nis humanly possible. Be objective. Put yourself in a glass tube and look at yourself as a disinterested\nthird party would look at the situation. See if you have a weakness that you’ve never noticed before.\nIf you have, take action to correct it. Many people become so accustomed to themselves that they fail\nto see ways for improvement."

    "raw_text": "The great Metropolitan Opera star Risë Stevens said in \nReader’s Digest\n (July 1955) that at the\nunhappiest moment of her life she received the best advice she’s ever had.\nEarly in her career, Miss Stevens lost the Metropolitan Opera “Auditions of the Air.” After\nlosing, Miss Stevens was bitter. “I longed to hear,” she said, “that my voice was really better than the\nother girl’s, that the verdict was grossly unfair, that I had just lacked the right connections to win.”\nBut Miss Stevens’s teacher didn’t coddle her. Instead she said to Miss Stevens, “My dear, have\nthe courage to face your faults.”\n“Much as I wanted to fall back on self-pity,” continued Miss Stevens, “they [those words] kept\ncoming back to me. That night they woke me. I couldn’t sleep until I faced my shortcomings. Lying\nthere in the dark, I asked myself, ‘Why did I fail?’ ‘How can I win next time?’ and I admitted to\nmyself that my voice range was not as good as it had to be, that I had to perfect my languages, that I\nmust learn more roles.”\nMiss Stevens went on to say how facing her faults not only helped her to succeed on stage but also\nhelped her win more friends and develop a more pleasing personality.\nBeing self-critical is constructive. It helps you to build the personal strength and efficiency\nneeded for success. Blaming others is destructive. You gain absolutely nothing from “proving” that\nsomeone else is wrong.\nBe constructively self-critical. Don’t run away from inadequacies. Be like the real professionals.\nThey seek out their faults and weaknesses, then correct them. That’s what makes them professionals.\nDon’t, of course, try to find your faults so you can say to yourself, “Here’s another reason I’m a\nloser.”\nInstead view your mistakes as “Here’s another way to make me a bigger winner.”\nThe great Orville Hubbard once said, “A failure is a man who has blundered but is not able to\ncash in on the experience.”\nOften we blame luck for our setbacks. We say, “Well, that’s the way the ball bounces,” and let it\ngo at that. But stop and think. Balls don’t bounce in certain ways for uncertain reasons. The bounce of\na ball is determined by three things: the ball, the way it is thrown, and the surface it strikes. Definite\nphysical laws explain the bounce of a ball, not luck.\nSuppose the CAA were to issue a report saying, “We’re sorry the crash occurred, but folks, that’s\njust the way the ball bounces.”\nYou’d say it’s time to get a new CAA. Or suppose a doctor explained to a relative, “I’m awfully\nsorry. I don’t know what happened. It’s just one of those things.”\nYou’d switch doctors when you or another relative became ill.\nThe that’s-the-way-the-ball-bounces approach teaches us nothing. We’re no better prepared to\navoid a duplication of the mistake the next time we face a similar situation. The football coach who\ntakes Saturday’s loss with “Well, boys, that’s the way the ball bounces” isn’t helping his team avoid\nthe same mistakes the next Saturday.\nOrville Hubbard, mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, for seventeen consecutive years, is one of the\nnation’s most colorful and respected urban administrators.\nFor ten years prior to becoming mayor of Dearborn, Mr. Hubbard could have used the “bad luck”\nexcuse and stepped out of politics.\nBefore becoming a perennial winner, Orville Hubbard was “unlucky” three times in trying to get\nthe nomination for mayor. \nThree times he tried to get the nomination for state senator, but failed. Once\nhe was beaten in a race for a congressional nomination.\nBut Orville Hubbard studied these setbacks. He regarded them as part of his political education.\n\f\nAnd today he is one of the sharpest, most unbeatable politicians in local government.\nInstead of blaming luck, research those setbacks. If you lose, learn. Lots of folks go through life\nexplaining their mediocrity with “hard luck,” “tough luck,” “sour luck,” “bad luck.” These people are\nstill like children, immature, searching for sympathy. Without realizing it, they fail to see\nopportunities to grow bigger, stronger, more self-reliant.\nStop blaming luck. Blaming luck never got anyone where he wanted to go.\n*\nA friend who is a literary consultant, writer, and critic chatted with me recently about what it takes to\nbe a successful writer.\n“A lot of would-be writers,” he explained, “simply aren’t serious about wanting to write. They try\nfor a little while but give it up when they discover there is real work involved. I haven’t much\npatience with these people because they’re looking for a shortcut and there just isn’t one.\n“But,” he went on, “I don’t want to imply that pure persistence is enough. The plain truth is, often\nit isn’t.\n“Just now I’m working with a fellow who’s written sixty-two short fiction pieces but hasn’t sold\none. Obviously, he is persistent in his goal to become a writer. But this fellow’s problem is that he\nuses the same basic approach in everything he writes. He’s developed a hard format for his stories.\nHe has never experimented with his material—his plots and characters, and perhaps \neven style. What\nI’m trying to do now is to get this client to try some new approaches and some new techniques. He\nhas ability, and if he’ll do some experimenting, I’m sure he’ll sell much of what he writes. But until\nhe does, he’ll just go on receiving one rejection slip after another.”\nThe advice of the literary consultant is good. We must have persistence. But persistence is only\none of the ingredients of victory. We can try and try, and try and try and try again, and still fail, unless\nwe combine persistence with experimentation.\nEdison is credited with being one of America’s most persistent scientists. It’s reported that he\nconducted thousands of experiments before he invented the electric lightbulb. But note: Edison\nconducted \nexperiments.\n He persisted in his goal to develop a lightbulb. But he made that persistence\npay off by blending it with experimentation.\nPersisting in one way is not a guarantee of victory. But persistence blended with experimentation\ndoes guarantee success.\nRecently I noticed an article about the continuous search for oil. It said that oil companies study\nthe rock formations carefully before they drill a well. Yet, despite their scientific analysis, seven out\nof eight wells drilled turn out to be dry holes. Oil companies are persistent in their search for oil, not\nby digging one hole to ridiculous depths but rather by experimenting with a new well when good\njudgment says the first well won’t produce.\nMany ambitious people go through life with admirable persistence and show of ambition, but they\nfail to succeed because they don’t experiment with new approaches. Stay with your goal. Don’t\nwaver an inch from it. But don’t beat your head against a wall. If you aren’t getting results, try a new\napproach.\nPeople who have bulldog persistence, who can grab something \nand not let go, have an essential\nsuccess quality. Here are two suggestions for developing greater power to experiment, the ingredient,\nthat, when blended with persistence, gets results.\n1. \nTell yourself, “There IS a way.”\n All thoughts are magnetic. As soon as you tell yourself, “I’m\n\f\nbeaten. There’s no way to conquer this problem,” negative thoughts are attracted, and each of these\nhelps convince you that you are right, that you are whipped.\nBelieve instead, “There \nis\n a way to solve this problem,” and positive thoughts rush into your mind\nto help you find a solution.\nIt’s believing there is a way that is important.\nMarriage counselors report no success in saving marriages until one and preferably both partners\nsee that it \nis\n possible to win back happiness.\nPsychologists and social workers say an alcoholic is doomed to alcoholism until \nhe\n believes he\ncan beat his thirst.\nThis year thousands of new businesses are being formed. Five years from now only a small\nportion will be still in operation. Most of those who fail will say, “Competition was just too much.\nWe had no choice but to quit.” The real problem is that when most people hit the \nTAR\n (things are\nrough) barrier, they think only defeat and so they are defeated.\nWhen you believe \nthere is a way\n you automatically convert negative energy (let’s quit, let’s go\nback) into positive energy (let’s keep going, let’s move ahead).\nA problem, a difficulty, becomes unsolvable only when you think it is unsolvable. Attract\nsolutions by believing solutions are possible. Refuse, simply refuse, to even let yourself say or think\nthat it’s impossible.\n2. \nBack off and start afresh.\n Often we stay so close to a problem for so long that we can’t see\nnew solutions or new approaches.\nAn engineer friend was retained a few weeks ago to design a distinctly new aluminum structure;\nin fact, nothing even resembling it had even been developed, or designed, before. I saw him just a few\ndays ago, and I asked him how his new building was coming along.\n“Not too well,” he replied. “I guess I haven’t spent enough time with my garden this summer.\nWhen I live with tough design problems for a long stretch, I’ve got to get away and let some new\nideas soak in.\n“You’d be surprised,” he continued, “to know how many engineering ideas come to me when I’m\njust sitting beside a tree holding a water hose on the grass.”\nPresident Eisenhower once was asked at a news conference why he took so many weekend\nvacations. His answer is good advice for everybody who wants to maximize his creative ability. Mr.\nEisenhower said, “I do not believe that any individual, whether he is running General Motors or the\nUnited States of America, can do the best job just by sitting at a desk and putting his face in a bunch of\npapers. Actually, the president ought to be trying to keep his mind free of inconsequential details and\ndoing his own thinking on the basic principles and factors . . . so that he can make clear and better\njudgments.”\nA former business associate of mine takes a seventy-two-hour out-of-town vacation with his wife\nonce each month. He found this backing off and starting afresh increased his mental efficiency, thereby\nmaking him more valuable to his clients.\nWhen you hit a snag, don’t throw up the whole project. \nInstead, back off, get mentally refreshed.\nTry something as simple as playing some music or taking a walk or a short nap. Then, when you\ntackle it again, the solution often comes almost before you know it.\nSeeing the good side pays off in big situations, too. A young man told me how he concentrated on\nseeing the good side when he lost his job. He explained it this way: “I was working for a large credit\nreporting company. One day I was given short notice to leave. There was an economy wave on, and\nthey dismissed the employees who were ‘least valuable’ to the company.\n\f\n“The job didn’t pay too well, but by the standards I grew up with, it was pretty good. I really felt\nterrible for a few hours, but then I decided to look at being bounced as a blessing in disguise. I really\ndidn’t like the job much, and had I stayed there, I’d never have gone far. Now I had a chance to find\nsomething I really liked to do. It wasn’t long until I found a job that I liked a lot better that paid more\nmoney, too. Being fired from that credit company was the best thing that ever happened to me.”\nRemember, you see in any situation what you expect to see. See the good side and conquer defeat.\nAll things \ndo\n work together for good if you’ll just develop clear vision.\n\f\nIN QUICK REVIEW\nThe difference between success and failure is found in one’s attitudes toward setbacks, handicaps,\ndiscouragements, and other disappointing situations.\nFive guideposts to help you turn defeat into victory are:\n1. Study setbacks to pave your way to success. When you lose, learn, and then go on to win next time.\n2. Have the courage to be your own constructive critic. Seek out your faults and weaknesses and then\ncorrect them. This makes you a professional.\n3. Stop blaming luck. Research each setback. Find out what went wrong. Remember, blaming luck\nnever got anyone where he wanted to go.\n4. Blend persistence with experimentation. Stay with your goal but don’t beat your head against a\nstone wall. Try new approaches. Experiment.\n5. Remember, there \nis\n a good side in every situation. Find it. See the good side and whip\ndiscouragement.\n\f\n12"

    "raw_text": "USE GOALS TO HELP YOU GROW\nEvery bit of human progress—our inventions big and little, our medical discoveries, our engineering\ntriumphs, our business successes—were first visualized before they became realities. Baby moons\ncircle the earth not because of accidental discoveries but because scientists set “conquer space” as a\ngoal.\nA goal is an objective, a purpose. A goal is more than a dream; it’s a dream being acted upon. A\ngoal is more than a hazy “Oh, I wish I could.” A goal is a clear “This is what I’m working toward.”\nNothing happens, no forward steps are taken, until a goal is established. Without goals individuals\njust wander through life. They stumble along, never knowing where they are going, so they never get\nanywhere.\nGoals are as essential to success as air is to life. No one ever stumbles into success without a\ngoal. No one ever lives without air. Get a clear fix on where you want to go.\nDave Mahoney rose from a low-paying job in the mail room of an advertising agency to an agency\nvice president at twenty-seven, and president of the Good Humor Company at thirty-three. This is\nwhat he says about goals: “The important thing is not where you were or where you are but where you\nwant to get.”\nThe important thing is not where you were or where you are but where you want to get.\nThe progressive corporation plans company goals ten to fifteen years ahead. Executives who\nmanage leading businesses must ask, “Where do we want our company to be ten years from now?”\nThen they gauge their efforts accordingly. New plant capacity is built not for today’s needs but rather\nfor needs five to ten years in the future. Research is undertaken to develop products that won’t appear\nfor a decade or longer.\nThe modern corporation does not leave its future to chance. Should you?\nEach of us can learn a precious lesson from the forward-looking business. We can and should\nplan at least ten years ahead. You must form an image \nnow\n of the person you want to be ten years from\nnow if you are to become that image. This is a critical thought. Just as the business that neglects to\nplan ahead will be just another business (if it even survives), the individual who fails to set long-\nrange goals will most certainly be just another person lost in life’s shuffle. Without goals we cannot\ngrow.\nLet me share with you an example of why we must have long-run goals to achieve real success.\nJust last week a young man (let me call him F. B.) came to me with a career problem. F. B. looked\nwell mannered and intelligent. He was single and had finished college four years ago.\nWe talked for a while about what he was doing now, his education, his aptitudes, and general\nbackground. Then I said to him, “You came to see me for help on making a job change. What kind of\njob are you looking for?”\n“Well,” he said, “that’s what I came to see you about. I don’t know what I want to do.”\nHis problem, of course, was a very common one. But I realized that just to arrange for the young\nman to have interviews with several possible employers would not help him. Trial and error is a\n\f\npretty poor way to select a career. With dozens of career possibilities, the odds of stumbling into the\nright choice are several dozen to one. I knew I had to help F. B. see that before he starts going some\nplace careerwise, he’s got to know where that someplace is.\nSo I said, “Let’s look at your career plan from this angle. Will you describe for me your image of\nyourself ten years from now?”\nF. B., obviously studying the question, finally said, “Well, I guess I want what just about everyone\nelse wants: a good job that pays well and a nice home. Really, though,” he continued, “I haven’t given\nit too much thought.”\nThis, I assured him, was quite natural. I went on to explain that his approach to selecting a career\nwas like going to an airline ticket counter and saying “Give me a ticket.” The people selling the\ntickets just can’t help you unless you give them a destination. So I said, “And I can’t help you find a\njob until I know what your destination is, and only you can tell me that.”\nThis jarred F. B. into thinking. We spent the next two hours not talking about the merits of different\nkinds of jobs, but rather discussing how to set goals. F. B. learned, I believe, the most important\nlesson in career planning: \nBefore you start out, know where you want to go.\nLike the progressive corporation, plan ahead. You are in a sense a business unit. Your talent,\nskills, and abilities are your “products.” You want to develop your products so they command the\nhighest possible price. Forward planning will do it.\nHere are two steps that will help:\nFirst, visualize your future in terms of three departments: work, home, and social. Dividing your\nlife this way keeps you from becoming confused, prevents conflicts, helps you look at the whole\npicture.\nSecond, demand of yourself clear, precise answers to these questions: What do I want to\naccomplish with my life? What do I want to be? and What does it take to satisfy me?\nUse the planning guide below to help.\n\f\nAN IMAGE OF ME, 10 YEARS FROM NOW: 10 YEARS’ PLANNING GUIDE\nA. \nWork Department:\n 10 years from now:\n1. What income level do I want to attain?\n2. What level of responsibility do I seek?\n3. How much authority do I want to command?\n4. What prestige do I expect to gain from my work?\nB. \nHome Department:\n 10 years from now:\n1. What kind of standard of living do I want to provide for my family and myself?\n2. What kind of house do I want to live in?\n3. What kind of vacations do I want to take?\n4. What financial support do I want to give my children in their early adult years?\nC. \nSocial Department:\n 10 years from now:\n1. What kinds of friends do I want to have?\n2. What social groups do I want to join?\n3. What community leadership positions would I like to hold?\n4. What worthwhile causes do I want to champion?\nA few years ago, my young son insisted the two of us build a doghouse for Peanut, an intelligent\npup of dubious pedigree and my son’s pride and joy. His persistence and enthusiasm won, so we\nproceeded to build a home Peanut could call her own. Our combined carpentry talent equaled zero,\nand the end product clearly reflected that fact.\nShortly afterward a good friend stopped by and upon seeing what we had done asked, “What’s\nthat you’ve stuck up there among the trees? That’s not a doghouse, is it?” I replied that it was. Then he\npointed out just a few of our mistakes and summed it all up with “Why didn’t you get a plan? Nobody\nthese days builds a doghouse without a blueprint.”\nAnd, please, as you visualize your future, don’t be afraid to be blue sky. People these days are\nmeasured by the size of their dreams. No one accomplishes more than he sets out to accomplish. So\nvisualize a big future.\nBelow is a word-for-word excerpt from the life plan of one of my former trainees. Read it. Note\nhow well this fellow visualized his “home” future. As he wrote this, it is obvious he really saw\nhimself in the future.\n“My home goal is to own a country estate. The house will be of the typical Southern-manor type,\ntwo stories, white columns and all. We will have the grounds fenced in, and probably will have a\nfishpond or two on the place as my wife and I both enjoy fishing. We will keep our Doberman kennels\nback of the house somewhere. The thing I have always wanted is a long winding driveway with trees\nlining each side.\n“\nBut\n a house is not necessarily a home. I am going to do everything I can to make our house more\nthan just a place to eat and sleep. Of course, we do not intend to leave God out of our \nplans and\nthroughout the years we will spend a certain amount of time in church activities.\n“Ten years from now I want to be in a position to take a family cruise around the world. I would\nlike very much to do this before the family gets scattered all over the world by marriages, etc. If we\ncan’t find time to make the cruise all at once, we will put it into four or five separate vacations and"

    "raw_text": "visit a different part of the world each year. Naturally, all these plans in ‘home department’ depend on\nhow well things go in my ‘work department,’ so I’ll have to keep on the ball if I’m to accomplish all\nthis.”\nThis plan was written five years ago. The trainee then owned two small dimestores. Now he\nowns five. And he has purchased seventeen acres for his country estate. He’s thinking and progressing\nright along toward his goal.\nThe three departments of your life are closely interrelated. Each depends on the others to some\nextent. But the one department that has the most influence over the other departments is your work.\nThousands of years ago the caveman who had the happiest home life and was most respected by his\ncavemates was the fellow who was most successful as a hunter. As a generalization, the same point\nholds true today. The standard of living we provide our families and the social and community\nrespect we attain depends largely on our success in the work department.\nNot long ago the McKinsey Foundation for Management Research conducted a large-scale study\nto determine what it takes to become an executive. Leaders in business, government, science, and\nreligion were questioned. Over and over again in different ways these researchers kept getting one\nanswer: the most important qualification for an executive is the \nsheer desire to get ahead.\nRemember this advice of John Wanamaker: “A man is not doing much until the cause he works for\npossesses all there is of him.”\nDesire, when harnessed, is \npower.\n Failure to follow desire, to do what you want to do most,\npaves the way to mediocrity.\nI recall a conversation with a very promising young writer on a college newspaper. This fellow\nhad ability. If anyone showed promise for a career in journalism, it was he. Shortly before his\ngraduation I asked him, “Well, Dan, what are you going to do, get into some form of journalism?” Dan\nlooked at me and said, “Heck, no! I like writing and reporting very much, and I’ve had a lot of fun\nworking on the college paper. But journalists are a dime a dozen, and I don’t want to starve.”\nI didn’t see or hear from Dan for five years. Then one evening I chanced to meet him in New\nOrleans. Dan was working as an assistant personnel director for an electronics company. And he was\nquick to let me know that he was quite dissatisfied with his work. “Oh, I’m reasonably well paid. I’m\nwith a wonderful company, and I’ve got reasonable security, but you know, my heart isn’t in it. I wish\nnow I’d gone with a publisher or newspaper when I finished school.”\nDan’s attitude reflected boredom, uninterest. He was cynical about many things. He will never\nachieve maximum success until he quits his present job and gets into journalism. Success requires\nheart-and-soul effort, and you can put your heart and soul only into something you really desire.\nHad Dan followed his desire, he could have risen to the very top in some phase of\ncommunication. And over the long pull he would have made much more money and achieved far more\npersonal satisfaction than he will find in his present kind of work.\nSwitching from what you don’t like to do to what you do like to do is like putting a five-hundred-\nhorsepower motor in a ten-year-old car.\nAll of us have desires. All of us dream of what we really want to do. But few of us actually\nsurrender to desire. Instead of surrendering to desire, we murder it. Five weapons are used to commit\nsuccess suicide. Destroy them. They’re dangerous.\n1. \nSelf-depreciation.\n You have heard dozens of people say, “I would like to be a doctor (or an\nexecutive or a commercial artist or in business for myself) but I can’t do it.” “I lack brains.” “I’d\nfail if I tried.” “I lack the education and/or experience.” Many young folks destroy desire with the\n\f\nold negative self-depreciation.\n2. \n“Security-itis.”\n Persons who say, “I’ve got security where I am” use the security weapons to\nmurder their dreams.\n3. \nCompetition.\n “The field is already overcrowded,” “People in that field are standing on top of each\nother” are remarks which kill desire fast.\n4. \nParental dictation.\n I’ve heard hundreds of young people explain their career choice with “I’d\nreally like to prepare for something else, but my parents want me to do this so I must.” Most\nparents, I believe, do not intentionally dictate to their children what they must do. What all\nintelligent parents want is to see their children live successfully. If the young person will patiently\nexplain why he or she prefers a different career, and if the parent will listen, there will be \nno\nfriction. The objectives of both the parent and the young person for the young person’s career are\nidentical: success.\n5. \nFamily responsibility.\n The attitude of “It would have been wise for me to change over five years\nago, but now I’ve got a family and I can’t change,” illustrates this kind of desire murder weapon.\nThrow away those murder weapons! Remember, the only way to get full power, to develop full go\nforce, is to do what you want to do. Surrender to desire and gain energy, enthusiasm, mental zip, and\neven better health.\nAnd it’s never too late to let desire take over.\nThe overwhelming majority of really successful people work much longer than forty hours a\nweek. And you don’t hear them complain of overwork. Successful people have their eyes focused on\na goal, and this provides energy.\nThe point is this: energy increases, multiplies, when you set a desired goal and resolve to work\ntoward that goal. Many people, millions of them, can find new energy by selecting a goal and giving\nall they’ve got to accomplish that goal. Goals cure boredom. Goals even cure many chronic ailments.\nLet’s probe a little deeper into the power of goals. When you surrender yourself to your desires,\nwhen you let yourself become obsessed with a goal, you receive the physical power, energy, and\nenthusiasm needed to accomplish your goal. But you receive something else, something equally\nvaluable. You receive the “automatic instrumentation” needed to keep you going straight to your\nobjective.\nThe most amazing thing about a deeply entrenched goal is \nthat it keeps you on course to reach your\ntarget. This isn’t double-talk. What happens is this. When you surrender to your goal, the goal works\nitself into your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is always in balance. Your conscious\nmind is not, unless it is in tune with what your subconscious mind is thinking. Without full cooperation\nfrom the subconscious mind, a person is hesitant, confused, indecisive. Now, with your goal absorbed\ninto your subconscious mind you react the right way automatically. The conscious mind is free for\nclear, straight thinking.\nLet’s illustrate this with two hypothetical persons. As you read on you’ll recognize these\ncharacters among the real people you know. We’ll call them Tom and Jack. These fellows are\ncomparable in all respects except one: Tom has a firmly entrenched goal; Jack does not. Tom has a\ncrystal-clear image of what he wants to be. He pictures himself as a corporation vice president ten\n\f\nyears hence.\nBecause Tom has surrendered to his goal, his goal through his subconscious mind signals to him\nsaying “do this” or “don’t do that; it won’t help get you where you want to go.” The goal constantly\nspeaks, “I am the image you want to make real. Here is what you must do to make me real.”\nTom’s goal does not pilot him in vague generalities. It gives him specific directions in all his\nactivities. When Tom buys a suit, the goal speaks and shows Tom the wise choice. The goal helps to\nshow Tom what steps to take to move up to the next job, what to say in the business conference, what\nto do when conflict develops, what to read, what stand to take. Should Tom drift a little off course,\nhis automatic instrumentation, housed securely in his subconscious mind, alerts him and tells him\nwhat to do to get back on course.\nTom’s goal has made him supersensitive to all the many forces at work that affect him.\nJack, on the other hand, lacking a goal, also lacks the automatic instrumentation to guide him. He\nis easily confused. His actions reflect no personal policy. Jack wavers, shifts, guesses at what to do.\nLacking consistency of purpose, Jack flounders on the rutty road to mediocrity.\nMay I suggest you reread the above section, right now. Let this concept soak in. Then look around\nyou. Study the very top echelon of successful persons. Note how they, without exception, are totally\ndevoted to their objective. Observe how the life of a highly successful person is integrated around a\npurpose.\nSurrender to that goal. Really surrender. Let it obsess you and give you the automatic\ninstrumentation you need to reach that goal.\n*\nOn occasion all of us have waked up on Saturday morning with no plans, no agenda either mental or\nwritten that spells out what we’re going to do. On days like that we accomplish next to nothing. We\naimlessly drift through the day, glad when it’s finally over. But when we face the day with a plan, we\nget things done.\nThis common experience provides an important lesson: to accomplish something, we must plan to\naccomplish something.\nBefore World War II our scientists saw the potential power locked in the atom. But relatively\nlittle was known about how to split the atom and unleash that tremendous power. When the United\nStates entered the war, forward-looking scientists saw the potential power of an atomic bomb. A\ncrash program was developed to accomplish just one goal: build an atomic \nbomb. The result is\nhistory. In just a few years the concentrated effort paid off. The bombs were dropped, and the war\nwas ended. But without that crash program to accomplish a goal, splitting the atom would have been\ndelayed perhaps a decade, maybe longer.\nSet goals to get things done.\nOur great production system would be hopelessly bogged down if production executives did not\nestablish and adhere to target dates and production schedules. Sales executives know salesmen sell\nmore when they are given a carefully defined quota to sell. Professors know students get term papers\nwritten on time when a deadline is set.\nNow, as you press forward to success, set goals: deadlines, target dates, self-imposed quotas.\nYou will accomplish only what you plan to accomplish.\n*"

    "raw_text": "According to Dr. George E. Burch of the Tulane University School of Medicine, an expert in the study\nof human longevity, many things determine how long you will live: weight, heredity, diet, psychic\ntension, personal habits. But Dr. Burch says, “The quickest way to the end is to retire and do nothing.\nEvery human being must keep an interest in life just to keep living.”\nEach of us has a choice. Retirement can be the beginning or the end. The “do nothing but eat,\nsleep, and rock” attitude is the poison-yourself-fast form of retirement. Most folks who regard\nretirement as the end of purposeful living soon find retirement is the end of life itself. With nothing to\nlive for, no goals, people waste away fast.\nThe other extreme, the sensible way to retire, is the “I’m going to pitch right in and start fast”\nmethod. One of my finest \nfriends, Lew Gordon, has chosen this way to retire. Lew’s retirement\nseveral years ago as a vice president of Atlanta’s biggest bank was really Commencement Day for\nhim. He established himself as a business consultant. And his pace is amazing.\nNow in his sixties, he serves numerous clients and is in national demand as a speaker. One of his\nspecial projects is helping to build Pi Sigma Epsilon, a young but fast-growing fraternity for\nprofessional salesmen and sales executives. Every time I see Lew he seems younger. He’s a young\nthirty in spirit. Few people I know of any age are reaping more from life than this senior citizen who\nresolved not to go out to pasture.\nAnd the Lew Gordons aren’t the boring old grumps feeling sorry for themselves because they’re\nold.\nGoals, intense goals, can keep a person alive when nothing else will. Mrs. D., the mother of a\ncollege friend of mine, contracted cancer when her son was only two. To darken matters, her husband\nhad died only three months before her illness was diagnosed. Her physicians offered little hope. But\nMrs. D. would not give up. She was determined that she would see her two-year-old son through\ncollege by operating a small retail store left her by her husband. There were numerous surgical\noperations. Each time the doctors would say, “Just a few more months.”\nThe cancer was never cured. But those “few more months” stretched into twenty years. She saw\nher son graduated from college. Six weeks later she was gone.\nA goal, a burning desire, was powerful enough to stave off sure death for two decades.\nUse goals to live longer. No medicine in the world—and \nyour physician will bear this out—is as\npowerful in bringing about long life as is \nthe desire to do something.\n*\nThe person determined to achieve maximum success learns the principle that \nprogress is made one\nstep at a time.\n A house is built a brick at a time. Football games are won a play at a time. A\ndepartment store grows bigger one new customer at a time. Every big accomplishment is a series of\nlittle accomplishments.\nEric Sevareid, the well-known author and correspondent, reported in \nReader’s Digest\n (April\n1957) that the best advice he ever received was the principle of the “next mile.” Here’s part of what\nhe said:\n“During World War II, I and several others had to parachute from a crippled Army transport plane\ninto the mountainous jungle on the Burma-India border. It was several weeks before an armed relief\nexpedition could reach us, and then we began a painful, plodding march ‘out’ to civilized India. We\nwere faced by a 140-mile trek, over mountains, in August heat and monsoon rains.\n“In the first hour of the march I rammed a boot nail deep into one foot; by evening I had bleeding\n\f\nblisters the size of a 50-cent piece on both feet. Could I hobble 140 miles? Could the others, some in\nworse shape than I, complete such a distance? We were convinced we could not. But we \ncould\nhobble to that ridge, we \ncould\n make the next friendly village for the night. And that, of course, was all\nwe had to do. . . .\n“When I relinquished my job and income to undertake a book of a quarter of a million words, I\ncould not bear to let my mind dwell on the whole scope of the project. I would surely \nhave\nabandoned what has become my deepest source of professional pride. I tried to think only of the next\nparagraph, not the next page and certainly not the next chapter. Thus, for six solid months, I never did\nanything but set down one paragraph after another. The book ‘wrote itself.’\n“Years ago, I took on a daily writing and broadcasting chore that has totaled, now, more than 2000\nscripts. Had I been asked at the time to sign a contract ‘to write 2000 scripts’ I would have refused in\ndespair at the enormousness of such an undertaking. But I was only asked to write one, the next one,\nand that is all I have ever done.”\nThe principle of the “next mile” works for Eric Sevareid, and it will work for you.\nThe step-by-step method is the only intelligent way to attain any objective. The best formula I\nhave heard for quitting smoking, the one that has worked for more of my friends than any other, I call\nthe hour-by-hour method. Instead of trying to reach the ultimate goal—freedom from the habit—just\nby resolving never to smoke again, the person resolves not to smoke for another hour. When the hour\nis up, the smoker simply renews his resolution not to smoke for \nanother\n hour. Later, as desire\ndiminishes, the period is extended to two hours, later to a day. Eventually, the goal is won. The\nperson who wants freedom from the habit \nall at once\n fails because the psychological pain is more\nthan he can stand. An hour is easy; forever is difficult.\nWinning any objective requires a step-by-step method. To the junior executive, each assignment,\nhowever insignificant it may appear, should be viewed as an opportunity to take one step forward. A\nsalesman qualifies for management responsibilities one sale at a time.\nTo the minister each sermon, to the professor each lecture, to the scientist each experiment, to the\nbusiness executive each conference is an opportunity to take one step forward toward the large goal.\nSometimes it appears that someone achieves success all at once. But if you check the past\nhistories of people who seemed to arrive at the top suddenly, you’ll discover a lot of solid\ngroundwork was previously laid. And those “successful” people who lose fame as fast as they found\nit simply were phonies who had not built a solid foundation.\nJust as a beautiful building is created from pieces of stone, each of which in itself appears\ninsignificant, in like manner the successful life is constructed.\nDo this: Start marching toward your ultimate goal by making the next task you perform, regardless\nof how unimportant it may seem, a step in the right direction. Commit this question to memory and use\nit to evaluate everything you do: \n“Will this help take me where I want to go?”\n If the answer is no,\nback off; if yes, press ahead.\nIt’s clear. We do not make one big jump to success. We get there one step at a time. An excellent\nplan is to set monthly quotas for accomplishment.\nExamine yourself. Decide what specific things you should do to make yourself more effective.\nUse the form below as a guide. Under each of the major headings make notes of the things you will do\nin the next thirty days. Then, when the thirty-day period is up, check your progress and build a new\nthirty-day goal. Always keep working on the “little” things to get you in shape for the big things."

Invest two hours each week in reading professional magazines in my field.\n2. Read one self-help book.\n3. Make four new friends.\n4. Spend 30 minutes daily in quiet, undisturbed thinking.\nNext time you see a particularly well-poised, well-groomed, clear-thinking, effective person,\nremind yourself that he wasn’t born that way. Lots of conscious effort, invested day by day, made the\nperson what he is. Building new positive habits and destroying old negative habits is a day-by-day\nprocess.\nCreate your first thirty-day improvement guide right now.\nOften, when I discuss setting goals, someone comments along these lines, “I see that working\ntoward a purpose is important, but so often things happen that upset my plans.”\nIt’s true that many factors outside your control do affect your destination. There may be serious\nillness or death in your family, the job you’re gunning for may be dissolved, you may meet with an\naccident.\nSo here is a point we must fix firmly in mind: \nprepare to take detours in stride.\n If you are driving\ndown a road and you come to a “road closed” situation, you wouldn’t camp there, nor would you go\nback home. The road closed simply means you can’t go where you want to go on this road. You’d\nsimply find another road to take you where you want to go.\nObserve what military leaders do. When they develop a master plan to take an objective, they\n\f\nalso map out alternative plans. If something unforeseen happens that rules out plan A, they switch to\nplan B. You rest easy in an airplane even though \nthe airport where you planned to land is closed in,\nbecause you know the fellow up there driving the plane has alternative landing fields and a reserve\nfuel supply.\nIt’s a rare person who has achieved high-level success who has not had to take detours—many of\nthem.\nWhen we detour, we don’t have to change our goals. We just travel a different route.\n*\nYou’ve probably heard many persons say something like “Oh, how I wish I had bought XX stock back\nin 19—. I’d have a pile of money today.”\nNormally, people think of investing in terms of stocks or bonds, real estate, or some other type of\nproperty. But the biggest and most rewarding kind of investment is \nself-investment\n, purchasing things\nthat build mental power and proficiency.\nThe progressive business knows that how strong it will be five years from now depends not on\nwhat it does five years in the future but rather on what it does, invests, this year. Profit comes from\nonly one source: investment.\nThere’s a lesson for each of us. To profit, to get the extra reward above a “normal” income in the\nyears ahead, we must invest in ourselves. We must invest to achieve our goals.\nHere are two sound self-investments that will pay handsome profits in the years ahead:\n1. \nInvest in education.\n True education is the soundest investment you can make in yourself. But\nlet’s be sure we understand what education really is. Some folks measure education by the number of\nyears spent in school or the number of diplomas, certificates, and degrees earned. But this\nquantitative approach to \neducation doesn’t necessarily produce a successful person. Ralph J.\nCordiner, chairman of General Electric, expressed the attitude of top business management toward\neducation this way: “Two of our most outstanding presidents, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Coffin, never had\nan opportunity to attend college. Although some of our present officers have doctor’s degrees, twelve\nout of forty-one have no college degrees. We are interested in competency, not diplomas.” A diploma\nor degree may help you get a job, but it will not guarantee your progress on the job. “Business is\ninterested in competency, not diplomas.”\nTo others, education means the quantity of information a person has stashed away in his brain. But\nthe soak-up-facts method of education won’t get you where you want to go. More and more we\ndepend on books, files, and machines to warehouse information. If we can do only what a machine\ncan do, we’re in a real fix.\nReal education, the kind worth investing in, is that which develops and cultivates your mind. How\nwell educated a person is, is measured by how well his mind is developed—in brief, by how well he\nthinks.\nAnything that improves thinking ability is education. And you can obtain education in many ways.\nBut the most efficient sources of education for most people are nearby colleges and universities.\nEducation is their business.\nIf you haven’t been to college lately, you’re in for some wonderful surprises. You’ll be pleased at\nthe wide course offerings available. You’ll be even more pleased to discover who goes to school\nafter work. Not the phonies, but rather really promising persons, many of whom already hold very\nresponsible positions. \nIn one evening class of twenty-five persons I conducted recently, there were an"

They are going to school to build\ntheir minds, which is a sure way to invest in a better future.\nAnd make no mistake about this. Education is a real bargain. A moderate investment will keep\nyou in school one night each week for a full year. Compute the cost as a percentage of your gross\nincome and then ask yourself, “Isn’t my future worth this small investment?”\nWhy not make an investment decision right now?

And it will\nsurround you with other people who also are going places.\n2. \nInvest in idea starters.\n Education helps you mold your mind, stretch it, train it to meet new\nsituations and solve problems. Idea starters serve a related purpose. They feed your mind, give you\nconstructive material to think about.\nWhere are the best sources of idea starters? There are many, but to get a steady supply of high-\nquality idea material, why not do this: resolve to purchase at least one stimulating book each month\nand subscribe to two magazines or journals that stress ideas. For only a minor sum and a minimum of\ntime, you can be tuned in to some of the best thinkers available anywhere.\nAt a luncheon one day I overheard one fellow say, “But it costs too much. I can’t afford to take\nThe Wall Street Journal.\n” \nHis companion, obviously a much more success-minded person, replied,\n“Well, I’ve found that I can’t afford not to take it.”\nAgain, take your cue from the successful people.

    "raw_text": "LET’S TAKE ACTION\nNow in a quick recap, put these success-building principles to work:\n1. Get a clear fix on where you want to go. Create an image of yourself ten years from now.\n2. Write out your ten-year plan. Your life is too important to be left to chance. Put down on paper\nwhat you want to accomplish in your work, your home, and your social departments.\n3. Surrender yourself to your desires. Set goals to get more energy. Set goals to get things done. Set\ngoals and discover the real enjoyment of living.\n4. Let your major goal be your automatic pilot. When you let your goal absorb you, you’ll find\nyourself making the right decisions to reach your goal.\n5. Achieve your goal one step at a time. Regard each task you perform, regardless of how small it\nmay seem, as a step toward your goal.\n6. Build thirty-day goals. Day-by-day effort pays off.\n7. Take detours in stride. A detour simply means another route. It should never mean surrendering the\ngoal.\n8. Invest in yourself. Purchase those things that build mental power and efficiency. Invest in\neducation. Invest in idea starters.\n\f\n13\n\f\nHOW TO THINK LIKE A LEADER\nRemind yourself once again that you are not pulled to high levels of success. Rather, you are \nlifted\nthere by those working beside and below you.\nAchieving high-level success requires the support and the cooperation of others. And gaining this\nsupport and cooperation of others requires leadership ability. Success and the ability to lead others—\nthat is, getting them to do things they wouldn’t do if they were not led—go hand in hand.\nThe success-producing principles explained in the previous chapters are valuable equipment in\nhelping you develop your leadership capacity. At this point we want to master four special leadership\nrules or principles that can cause others to do things for us in the executive suite, in business, in\nsocial clubs, in the home, anywhere we find people.\nThese four leadership rules or principles are:\n1. Trade minds with the people you want to influence.\n2. Think: What is the human way to handle this?\n3. Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress.\n4. Take time out to confer with yourself and develop your supreme thinking power.\nPracticing these rules produces results. Putting them to use in everyday situations takes the\nmystery out of that gold-plated word, \nleadership.\nLet’s see how.\n\f\nLEADERSHIP RULE NUMBER 1: TRADE MINDS WITH THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO\nINFLUENCE.\nTrading minds with the people you want to influence is a magic way to get others—friends,\nassociates, customers, employees—to act the way you want them to act. Study these two case\nhistories and see why.\nTed B. worked as a television copywriter and director for a large advertising agency. When the\nagency obtained a new account, a children’s shoe manufacturer, Ted was assigned responsibility for\ndeveloping several TV commercials.\nA month or so after the campaign had been launched, it became clear that the advertising was\ndoing little or nothing to increase “product movement” in retail outlets. Attention was focused on the\nTV commercials, because in most cities only television advertising was used.\nThrough research of television viewers, they found that about 4 percent of the people thought it\nwas simply a great commercial, “one of the best,” these 4 percent said.\nThe remaining 96 percent were either indifferent to the commercials or, in plain language, thought\nthey “smelled.” \nHundreds of comments like these were volunteered: “It’s wacky. The rhythm sounds\nlike a New Orleans band at 3 \nA.M\n.” “My kids like to watch most TV commercials, but when that shoe\nthing comes on they go to the bathroom or refrigerator.” “I think it’s too uppity up.” “Seems to me\nsomeone’s trying to be too clever.”\nSomething especially interesting turned up when all the interviews were put together and\nanalyzed. The 4 percent who liked the commercial were people pretty much like Ted in terms of\nincome, education, sophistication, and interests. The remaining 96 percent were definitely in a\ndifferent socioeconomic class.\nTed’s commercials, which cost a lot of money, flopped because Ted thought only of his own\ninterests. He had prepared the commercials thinking of the way he buys shoes, not the way the great\nmajority buys shoes. He developed commercials that pleased him \npersonally\n, not commercials that\npleased the great bulk of the people.\nThe results would have been much different had Ted projected himself into the minds of the\nmasses of ordinary people and asked himself two questions: “If I were a parent, what kind of a\ncommercial would make me want to buy those shoes?” “If I were a child, what kind of a commercial\nwould make me go tell my Mom or Dad that I want those shoes?”\nWhy Joan Failed in Retailing\nJoan is an intelligent, well-educated, attractive girl of twenty-four. Fresh from college, Joan got a job\nas an assistant buyer in ready-to-wear goods at a low-to-medium-priced department store. She came\nhighly recommended. “Joan has ambition, talent, \nand enthusiasm,” one letter said. “She is certain to\nsucceed in a big way.”\nBut Joan did not succeed in a “big way.” Joan lasted only eight months and then quit retailing for\nother work.\nI knew her buyer well, and one day I asked him what happened.\n“Joan is a fine girl, and she has many fine qualities,” he said. “But she had one major limitation.”\n“What was that?” I asked.\n“Well, Joan was forever buying merchandise that she liked but most of our customers didn’t. She\nselected styles, colors, materials, and prices she liked without putting herself in the shoes of the\npeople who shop here. When I’d suggest to her that maybe a certain line wasn’t right for us, she’d say,\n\f\n‘Oh, they’ll love this. I do. I think this will move fast.’\n“Joan had been brought up in a well-to-do home. She had been educated to want quality. Price\nwas not important to her. Joan just couldn’t see clothing through the eyes of low-to-middle-income\npeople. So the merchandise she bought just wasn’t suitable.”\nThe point is this: To get others to do what you want them to do, you must see things through their\neyes. When you trade minds, the secret of how to influence other people effectively shows up. A very\nsuccessful salesman friend told me he spends a lot of time anticipating how prospects will react to his\npresentation before he gives it. Trading minds with the audience helps the speaker design a more\ninteresting, harder-hitting talk. Trading minds with employees helps the supervisor provide more\neffective, better received instructions.\nA young credit executive explained to me how this technique worked for him.\n“When I was brought into this store [a medium-sized clothing store] as assistant credit manager, I\nwas assigned the job of handling all collection correspondence. The collection letters the store had\nbeen using greatly disappointed me. They were strong, insulting, and threatening. I read them and\nthought, ‘Brother, I’d be mad as hell if somebody sent me letters like these. I never would pay.’ So I\njust got to work and started writing the kind of letter that would move me to pay an overdue bill if I\nreceived it. It worked. By putting myself in the shoes of the overdue customer, so to speak, collections\nclimbed to a record high.”\nNumerous political candidates lose elections because they fail to look at themselves through the\nminds of the typical voters. One political candidate for a national office, apparently fully as qualified\nas his opponent, lost by a tremendous margin for one single reason. He used a vocabulary that only a\nsmall percentage of the voters could understand.\nHis opponent, on the other hand, thought in terms of the voters’ interests. When he talked to\nfarmers, he used their language. When he spoke to factory workers, he used words they were easily\nfamiliar with. When he spoke on TV, he addressed himself to Mr. Typical Voter, not to Dr. College\nProfessor.\nKeep this question in mind: “What would I think of this if I exchanged places with the other\nperson?” It paves the way to more successful action.\nThinking of the interests of the people we want to influence is an excellent thought rule in every\nsituation. A few years ago a small electronics manufacturer developed a fuse that would \nnever blow\nout. The manufacturer priced the product to sell for $1.25 and then retained an advertising agency to\npromote it.\nThe account executive placed in charge of the advertising immediately became intensely\nenthusiastic. His plan was to blanket the country with mass advertising on TV, radio, and newspapers.\n“This is it,” he said. “We’ll sell ten million the first year.” His advisers tried to caution him,\nexplaining that fuses are not a popular item, they have no romantic appeal, and people want to get by\nas cheaply as possible when they buy fuses. “Why not,” the advisors said, “use selected magazines\nand sell it to the high income levels?”\nThey were overruled, and the mass campaign was under way, only to be called off in six weeks\nbecause of “disappointing results.”\nThe trouble was this: the advertising executive looked at the high-priced fuses with his eyes, the\neyes of a high-income person. He failed to see the product through the eyes of the mass market income\nlevels. Had he put himself in their position, he would have seen the wisdom of directing the\npromotion toward the upper income groups and the account would have been saved.\nDevelop your power to trade minds with the people you want to influence. The exercises below\n\f\nwill help."

    "raw_text": "LEADERSHIP RULE NUMBER 2: THINK: WHAT IS THE HUMAN WAY TO HANDLE\nTHIS?\nPeople use different approaches to leadership situations. One approach is to assume the position of a\ndictator. The dictator makes all decisions without consulting those affected. He refuses to hear his\nsubordinates’ side of a question because, down deep perhaps, he’s afraid the subordinate might be\nright and this would cause him to lose face.\nDictators don’t last long. Employees may fake loyalty for a while, but unrest soon develops. Some\nof the best employees leave, and those remaining get together and plot against the tyrant. The result is\nthat the organization ceases to function smoothly. This puts the dictator in a bad light with \nhis\nsuperior.\nA second leadership technique is the cold, mechanical, I’m-a-rule-book-operator approach. The\nfellow using this approach handles everything exactly according to the book. He doesn’t recognize\nthat every rule or policy or plan is only a guide for the \nusual\n cases. This would-be leader treats\nhuman beings as \nmachines. And of all things people don’t like, perhaps the most disliked is being\ntreated like a machine. The cold, impersonal efficiency expert is not an ideal. The “machines” that\nwork for him develop only part of their energy.\nPersons who rise to tremendous leadership heights use a third approach that we call “Being\nHuman.”\nSeveral years ago I worked closely with John S., who is an executive in the engineering\ndevelopment section of a large aluminum manufacturer. John had mastered the “be-human” approach\nand was enjoying its rewards. In dozens of little ways John made his actions say, “You are a human\nbeing. I respect you. I’m here to help you in every way I can.”\nWhen an individual from another city joined his department, John went to considerable personal\ninconvenience to help him find suitable housing.\nWorking through his secretary and two other women employees, he set up office birthday parties\nfor each member of the staff. The thirty minutes or so required for this was not a cost; rather, it was an\ninvestment in getting loyalty and output.\nWhen he learned that one of his staff members belonged to a minority faith, John called him in and\nexplained that he would arrange for him to observe his religious holidays that don’t coincide with the\nmore common holidays.\nWhen an employee or someone in the employee’s family was ill, John remembered. He took time\nto compliment his staff individually for their off-the-job accomplishments.\nBut the largest evidence of John’s be-human philosophy showed up in the way he handled a\ndismissal problem. One of the employees who had been hired by John’s predecessor simply lacked\nthe aptitude and interest for the work involved. \nJohn handled the problem magnificently. He did not\nuse the conventional procedure of calling the employee into his office and giving him, first, the bad\nnews and then, second, fifteen or thirty days to move out.\nInstead, he did two unusual things. First, he explained why it would be to the employee’s personal\nadvantage to find a new situation where his aptitudes and interests would be more useful. He worked\nwith the employee and put him in touch with a reputable vocational guidance consultant. Next, he did\nsomething else above and beyond the call of duty. He helped the employee find a new job by setting\nup interviews with executives in other companies where the employee’s skills were needed. In just\neighteen days after the “dismissal” conference the employee was relocated in a very promising\n\f\nsituation.\nThis dismissal procedure intrigued me, so I asked John to explain his thinking behind it. He\nexplained it this way: “There’s an old maxim I’ve formed and held in my mind,” he began. “Whoever\nis under a man’s power is under his protection, too. We never should have hired this man in the first\nplace because he’s not cut out for this kind of work. But since we did, the least I could do was help\nhim to relocate.\n“Anybody,” John continued, “can hire a man. But the test of leadership is how one handles the\ndismissal. By helping that employee relocate before he left us built up a feeling of job security in\neveryone in my department. I let them know by example that no one gets dumped on the street as long\nas I’m here.”\nMake no mistake. John’s be-human brand of leadership paid off. There were no secret gossip\nsessions about John. He received unquestioned loyalty and support. He had maximum job security\nbecause he gave maximum job security to his subordinates.\nFor about fifteen years I’ve been close to a fellow I’ll call Bob W. Bob is in his late fifties. He\ncame up the hard way. With a hit-or-miss education and no money, Bob found himself out of work in\n1931. But he’s always been a scrambler. Not one to be idle, Bob started an upholstery shop in his\ngarage. Thanks to his untiring efforts, the business grew, and today it’s a modern furniture\nmanufacturing plant with over three hundred employees.\nToday Bob is a millionaire. Money and material things have ceased to be a concern. But Bob is\nrich in other ways too. He’s a millionaire in friends, contentment, and satisfaction.\nOf Bob’s many fine qualities, his tremendous desire to help other people stands out. Bob is\nhuman\n and he’s a specialist in treating others the way human beings want to be treated.\nOne day Bob and I were discussing the matter of criticizing people. Bob’s human way of doing it\nis a master formula. Here’s the way he put it. “I don’t think you could find anybody who would say\nI’m a softie or a weakling. I run a business. When something isn’t going right, I fix it. But it’s the way\nI fix it—that’s important. If employees are doing something wrong or are making a mistake, I am\ndoubly careful not to hurt their feelings and make them feel small or embarrassed. I just use four\nsimple steps:\n“First, I talk to them privately.\n“Second, I praise them for what they are doing well.\n“Third, I point out the one thing at the moment that they could do better and I help them find the\nway.\n“Fourth, I praise them again on their good points.\n“And this four-step formula works. When I do it this way, people thank me because I’ve found\nthat’s exactly the way they like it. When they walk out of this office, they have been reminded that they\nare not only pretty good, they can be even better.\n“I’ve been betting on people all my life,” Bob says. “And the better I treat them, the more good\nthings happen to me. I honestly don’t plan it that way. That’s just the way it works out.\n“Let me give you an example. Back about, oh, five or six years ago, one of the production men\ncame to work drunk. Pretty soon there was a commotion in the plant. It seems this fellow had taken a\nfive-gallon can of lacquer and was splashing it all over the place. Well, the other workmen took the\nlacquer away from him, and the plant superintendent escorted him out.\n“I walked outside and found him sitting against the building in a kind of stupor. I helped him up,\nput him in my car, and took him to his home. His wife was frantic. I tried to reassure her that\neverything would be all right. ‘Oh, but you don’t understand,’ she said. ‘Mr. W. [me] doesn’t stand for\n\f\nanyone being drunk on the job. Jim’s lost his job, and now what will we do?’ I told her Jim wouldn’t\nbe dismissed. She asked how I knew. The reason, I explained, is because I’m Mr. W.\n“She almost fainted. I told her I’d do all I could to help Jim at the plant and I hoped she’d do all\nshe could at home; and just have him on the job in the morning.\n“When I got back to the plant, I went down to Jim’s department and spoke to Jim’s co-workers. I\ntold them, ‘You’ve seen something unpleasant here today, but I want you to forget it. Jim will be back\ntomorrow. Be kind to him. He’s been a good worker for a long time, and we owe it to him to give him\nanother chance.’\n“Jim got back on the ball, and his drinking was never again a problem. I soon forgot about the\nincident. But Jim didn’t. Two years ago the headquarters of the local union sent some men here to\nnegotiate the contract for the local. They had some staggering, simply unrealistic demands. Jim—\nquiet, meek Jim—suddenly \nbecame a leader. He got busy and reminded the fellows in the plant that\nthey’d always gotten a fair deal from Mr. W. and we didn’t need outsiders coming to tell us how to\nrun our affairs.\n“The outsiders left, and as usual we negotiated our contract like friends, thanks to Jim.”\nHere are two ways to use the be-human approach to make you a better leader. First, each time you\nface a difficult matter involving people, ask yourself, “\nWhat is the human way to handle this\n?”\nPonder over this question when there is a disagreement among your subordinates or when an\nemployee creates a problem.\nRemember Bob W.’s formula for helping others correct their mistakes. Avoid sarcasm. Avoid\nbeing cynical. Avoid taking people down a peg or two. Avoid putting others in their place.\nAsk, “What is the human way to deal with people?” It always pays—sometimes sooner,\nsometimes later, but it always pays.\nA second way to profit from the be-human rule is to \nlet your action show you put people first.\nShow interest in your subordinates’ off-the-job accomplishments. Treat everyone with dignity.\nRemind yourself that the primary purpose in life is to enjoy it. As a general rule, the more interest you\nshow in a person, the more he will produce for you. And his production is what carries you forward\nto greater and greater success.\nPraise your subordinates to your supervisor by putting in plugs for them at every opportunity. It’s\nan old American custom to admire the fellow who’s on the side of the little man. Your subordinates\nwill appreciate your plugs, and their loyalty to you will grow. And do not fear that this will lower\nyour own importance \nin the eyes of your supervisor. Rather, a man big enough to be humble appears\nmore confident than the insecure man who feels compelled to call attention to his accomplishments. A\nlittle modesty goes a long way.\nPraise your subordinates personally at every opportunity. Praise them for their cooperation.\nPraise them for every extra effort they put forth. Praise is the greatest single incentive you can give\npeople, and it costs you nothing. Besides, a write-in vote has often overthrown a powerful, known\ncandidate. You never know when your subordinates can do you a turn by coming to your defense.\nPractice praising people.\nRub people the \nright\n way. Be human."

    "raw_text": "LEADERSHIP RULE NUMBER 3: THINK PROGRESS, BELIEVE IN PROGRESS, PUSH\nFOR PROGRESS.\nOne of the most complimentary things anyone can say about you is “He stands for progress. He’s the\nman for the job.”\nPromotions in all fields go to individuals who believe in—and push for—progress. Leaders, real\nleaders, are in short supply. Status-quo-ers (the everything’s-all-right-let’s-don’t-upset-the-apple-cart\nfolks) far outnumber the progressives (the there’s-lots-of-room-for-improvement-let’s-get-to-work-\nand-do-it-better people). Join the leadership elite. Develop a forward look.\nThere are two special things you can do to develop your progressive outlook:\n1. Think improvement in everything you do.\n2. Think high standards in everything you do.\nSeveral months ago the president of a medium-sized company asked me to help him make an\nimportant decision. This executive had built the business by himself and had been functioning as sales\nmanager. Now, with seven salesmen employed, he decided his next step was to promote one of his\nsalesmen to the job of sales manager. He narrowed the choice down to three, all of whom were about\nequal in experience and sales performance.\nMy assignment was to spend one day in the field with each man and then report my views on\nwhich fellow seemed to be best qualified to lead the group. Each man was told that a consultant\nwould visit him to discuss the overall marketing program. For obvious reasons, they were not told the\nspecific purpose of my visit.\nTwo of the men reacted pretty much the same way. Both were uncomfortable with me. They\nseemed to sense that I was there to “change things.” Each of these men was a real defender of the\nstatus quo. Both approved of the way everything was being done. I raised questions about how the\nterritories were laid out, the compensation program, the sales promotional material—every facet of\nthe marketing effort. But on all points, the response was always “Everything is okay.” On specific\npoints these two men explained why the present way couldn’t and shouldn’t be changed. Summed up,\nboth men wanted the status quo to remain the status quo. One of them said to me as he dropped me by\nmy hotel, “I don’t know exactly why you spent the day with me, but tell Mr. M. for me that everything\nis okay as is. Don’t go refiguring anything.”\nThe third man was wonderfully different. He was pleased with the company and proud of its\ngrowth. But he was not wholly content. He wanted improvements. All day this third \nsalesman gave\nme his ideas for getting new business, providing better service to customers, reducing wasted time,\nrevising the compensation plan to give more incentive, all so that he—and the company—would make\nmore. He had mapped out a new advertising campaign he had been thinking about. When I left him,\nhis parting remark was “I sure appreciate the chance to tell someone about some of my ideas. We’ve\ngot a good outfit, but I believe we can make it better.”\nMy recommendation, of course, was for the third man. It was a recommendation that coincided\nperfectly with the feelings of the company president. Believe in expansion, efficiency, new products,\nnew processes, better schools, increased prosperity.\nBelieve in—and push for—progress; and you’ll be a leader!\n\f\nAs a youngster, I had an opportunity to see how the different thinking of two leaders can make an\namazing difference in the performance of followers.\nI attended a country elementary school: eight grades, one teacher, and forty children all jammed\ntogether inside four brick walls. A new teacher was always a big deal. Led by the \nbig\n boys—the\nseventh- and eighth-graders—the pupils set out to see how much they could get away with.\nOne year there was little more than chaos. Every day there were dozens of the usual school\npranks, “wars” of spitballs, and paper airplanes. Then there were the major incidents such as locking\nthe teacher outside the school for half a day at a time, or on another occasion the opposite,\nbarricading her within the building for hours. Another day each boy in the upper grades brought his\ndog into the schoolroom.\nLet me add that these children were not delinquents. Stealing, physical violence, and deliberate\nharm were not their \nobjectives. They were healthy kids conditioned by vigorous rural living and\nneeding an outlet for their tremendous pent-up energies and ingenuities.\nWell, the teacher somehow managed to stay with the school until the end of that year. To no one’s\nsurprise, there was a new teacher the following September.\nThe new teacher extracted strikingly different performance from the children. She appealed to\ntheir personal pride and sense of respect. She encouraged them to develop judgment. Each child was\nassigned a specific responsibility like washing blackboards or cleaning erasers, or practicing paper\ngrading for the younger grades. The new teacher found creative ways to use the energy that had been\nso misdirected a few months before. Her educational program was centered on building character.\nWhy did the children act like young devils one year and like young angels the next? The difference\nwas the leader, their teacher. In all honesty, we cannot blame the kids for playing pranks an entire\nschool year. In each instance the teacher set the pace.\nThe first teacher, deep down, didn’t care whether the children made progress. She set no goals for\nthe children. She didn’t encourage them. She couldn’t control her temper. She didn’t like teaching, so\nthe pupils didn’t like learning.\nBut the second teacher had high, positive standards. She sincerely liked the children and wanted\nthem to accomplish much. She considered each one as an individual. She obtained discipline easily\nbecause in everything she did, \nshe\n was well disciplined.\nAnd in each case, the pupils adjusted their conduct to fit the examples set by the teachers.\nWe find this same form of adjustment taking place every day in adult groups. During World War II\nmilitary chiefs continually \nobserved that the highest morale was not found in units where commanders\nwere “easy,” “relaxed,” and “lackadaisical.” Crack units were led by officers with high standards\nwho enforced military regulations fairly and properly. Military personnel simply do not respect and\nadmire officers with low standards.\nCollege students, too, take their cue from the examples set by the professors. Students under one\nprofessor cut classes, copy term papers, and connive in various ways to pass without serious study.\nBut the same students under another professor willingly work extra hard to master the subject.\nIn business situations we again find individuals patterning their thinking after that of the superior.\nStudy a group of employees closely. Observe their habits, mannerisms, attitudes toward the company,\nethics, self-control. Then compare what you find with the behavior of their superior, and you discover\namazing similarities.\nEvery year many corporations that have grown sluggish and are headed downward are rebuilt.\nAnd how? By changing a handful of executives at the \ntop.\n Companies (and colleges and churches and\nclubs and unions and all other types of organizations) are successfully rebuilt from the top down, not"

    "raw_text": "LEADERSHIP RULE NUMBER 4: TAKE TIME OUT TO CONFER WITH YOURSELF AND\nTAP YOUR SUPREME THINKING POWER.\nWe usually picture leaders as exceptionally busy people. And they are. Leadership requires being in\nthe thick of things. But while it’s usually overlooked, it is noteworthy that leaders spend considerable\ntime alone, alone with nothing but their own thinking apparatus.\nCheck the lives of the great religious leaders, and you’ll find each of them spent considerable\ntime alone. Moses frequently was alone, often for long periods of time. So were Jesus, Buddha,\nConfucius, Mohammed, Gandhi—every outstanding religious leader in history spent much time in\nsolitude, away from the distractions of life.\nPolitical leaders, too, those who made lasting names in history for good or bad, gained insight\nthrough solitude. It is an interesting question whether Franklin D. Roosevelt could have developed his\nunusual leadership capacities had he not spent much time alone while recovering from his polio\nattack. Harry Truman spent much time as a boy and as an adult alone on a Missouri farm.\nQuite possibly Hitler would never have achieved power had he not spent months in jail alone,\nwhere he had time to construct \nMein Kampf\n, that brilliantly wicked plan for world conquest that sold\nthe Germans in a blind moment.\nMany of the leaders of communism who proved to be so diplomatically skillful—Lenin, Stalin,\nMarx, and many others—spent time in jail, where they could, without distraction, plan their future\nmoves.\nLeading universities require professors to lecture as few as five hours per week so that the\nprofessor has time to think.\nMany outstanding business executives are surrounded all day by assistants, secretaries,\ntelephones, and reports. But follow them around for 168 hours a week and 720 hours a month, and\nyou discover they spent a surprising amount of time in uninterrupted thought.\nThe point is this: the successful person in any field takes time out to confer with himself or\nherself. Leaders use solitude to put the pieces of a problem together, to work out solutions, to plan,\nand, in one phrase, to do their superthinking.\nMany people fail to tap their creative leadership power because they confer with everybody and\neverything else but themselves. You know this kind of person well. He’s the fellow who goes to great\nlengths \nnot\n to be alone. He goes to extremes to surround himself with people. He can’t stand being\nalone in his office, so he goes prowling to see other people. Seldom does he spend evenings alone.\nHe feels a compelling need to talk with others every waking moment. He devours a huge diet of small\ntalk and gossip.\nWhen this person is forced by circumstances to be physically alone, he finds ways to keep from\nbeing mentally alone. At times like these he resorts to television, newspapers, radio, telephone,\nanything that will take over his thinking process for him. In effect he says, “Here, Mr. TV, Mr.\nNewspaper, occupy my mind for me. I’m afraid to occupy it with my own thoughts.”\nMr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone shuns independent thought. \nHe keeps his own mind blacked out. He\nis, psychologically, scared of his own thoughts. As time goes by, Mr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone grows\nincreasingly shallow. He makes many ill-considered moves. He fails to develop firmness of purpose,\npersonal stability. He is, unfortunately, ignorant of the superpower lying unused just behind his\nforehead.\nDon’t be a Mr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone. Successful leaders tap their superpower through being\nalone. You can, too.\nLet’s see how.\n\f\nAs part of a professional development program I asked thirteen trainees to closet themselves for\none hour each day for two weeks. The trainees were asked to shut themselves off from all distractions\nand think constructively about anything that came to mind.\nAt the end of two weeks each trainee, without exception, reported the experience proved\namazingly practical and worthwhile. One fellow stated that before the managed solitude experiment\nhe was on the verge of a sharp break with another company executive, but through clear thinking he\nfound the source of the problem and the way to correct it. Others reported that they solved problems\nrelating to such varied things as changing jobs, marriage difficulties, buying a home, and selecting a\ncollege for a teenage child.\nEach trainee enthusiastically reported that he had gained a much better understanding of himself—\nhis strengths and weaknesses—than he had ever had before.\nThe trainees also discovered something else that is tremendously significant. \nThey discovered\nthat decisions and observations made alone in managed solitude have an uncanny way of being\n100 percent right!\n The trainees discovered that when the fog is lifted, the right choice becomes\ncrystal clear.\nManaged solitude pays off.\nOne day recently an associate of mine reversed her stand completely on a troublesome issue. I\nwas curious to know why she had switched her thinking, since the problem was very basic. Her\nanswer went like this. “Well, I haven’t been at all clear in my mind as to what we should do. So I got\nup at 3:30 this morning, fixed a cup of coffee, and just sat on the sofa and thought until 7 \nA.M\n. I see the\nwhole matter a lot clearer now. So the only thing for me to do is reverse my stand.”\nAnd her new stand proved completely correct.\nResolve now to set aside some time each day (at least thirty minutes) to be completely by\nyourself.\nPerhaps early in the morning before anyone else is stirring about would be best for you. Or\nperhaps late in the evening would be a better time. The important thing is to select a time when your\nmind is fresh and when you can be free from distractions.\nYou can use this time to do two types of thinking: directed and undirected. To do directed\nthinking, review the major problem facing you. In solitude your mind will study the problem\nobjectively and lead you to the right answer.\nTo do undirected thinking, just let your mind select what it wishes to think about. In moments like\nthese your subconscious mind taps your memory bank, which in turn feeds your conscious mind.\nUndirected thinking is very helpful in doing self-evaluation. It helps you get down to the very basic\nmatters like “How can I do better? What should be my next move?”\nRemember, the main job of the leader is thinking. And the best preparation for leadership is\nthinking. Spend some time in managed solitude every day and think yourself to success.\n\f\nSUMMARY\nTo be a more effective leader, put these four leadership principles to work\n1. Trade minds with the people you want to influence. It’s easy to get others to do what you want them\nto do if you’ll see things through their eyes. Ask yourself this question before you act: “What would\nI think of this if I exchanged places with the other person?”\n2. Apply the “Be-Human” rule in your dealings with others. Ask, “What is the human way to handle\nthis?” In everything you do, show that you put other people first. Just give other people the kind of\ntreatment you like to receive. You’ll be rewarded.\n3. Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress. Think improvement in everything you do.\nThink high standards in everything you do. Over a period of time subordinates tend to become\ncarbon copies of their chief. Be sure the master copy is worth duplicating. Make this a personal\nresolution: “At home, at work, in community life, if it’s progress I’m for it.”\n4. Take time out to confer with yourself and tap your supreme thinking power. Managed solitude pays\noff. Use it to release your creative power. Use it to find solutions to personal and business\nproblems. So spend some time alone every day just for thinking. Use the thinking technique all\ngreat leaders use: confer with yourself."

    "raw_text": "HOW TO USE THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG IN LIFE’S MOST CRUCIAL SITUATIONS\nThere is magic in thinking big. But it is so easy to forget. When you hit some rough spots, there is\ndanger that your thinking will shrink in size. And when it does, you lose.\nBelow are some brief guides for staying big when you’re tempted to use the small approach.\nPerhaps you’ll want to put these guides on small cards for even handier reference.\nA. When Little People Try to Drive You Down, THINK BIG\nTo be sure, there are some people who want you to lose, to experience misfortune, to be reprimanded.\nBut these people can’t hurt you if you’ll remember three things:\n1. You win when you refuse to fight petty people. Fighting little people reduces you to their\nsize. Stay big.\n2. Expect to be sniped at. It’s proof you’re growing.\n3. Remind yourself that snipers are psychologically sick. Be Big. Feel sorry for them.\nThink Big Enough to be immune to the attacks of petty people.\nB. When That “I-Haven’t-Got-What-It-Takes” Feeling Creeps Up on You, THINK BIG\nRemember: if you think you are weak, you are. If you think you’re inadequate, you are. If you think\nyou’re second-class, you are.\nWhip that natural tendency to sell yourself short with these tools:\n1. Look important. It helps you think important. How you \nlook on the outside has a lot to do\nwith how you feel on the inside.\n2. Concentrate on your assets. Build a sell-yourself-to-yourself commercial \nand use it.\n Learn\nto supercharge yourself. Know your \npositive\n self.\n3. Put other people in proper perspective. The other person is just another human being, so\nwhy be afraid of him?\nThink Big Enough to see how good you really are!\nC. When an Argument or Quarrel Seems Inevitable, THINK BIG.\nSuccessfully resist the temptation to argue and quarrel by:\n1. Asking yourself, “Honestly now, is this thing really important enough to argue about?”\n2. Reminding yourself, you never gain anything from an argument but you always lose\nsomething.\nThink Big Enough to see that quarrels, arguments, feuds, and fusses will never help you get where\nyou want to go.\nD. When You Feel Defeated, THINK BIG.\n\f\nIt is not possible to achieve large success without hardships and setbacks. But it \nis\n possible to live\nthe rest of your life without defeat. Big thinkers react to setbacks this way:\n1. Regard the setback as a lesson. Learn from it. Research it. Use it to propel you forward.\nSalvage something from every setback.\n2. Blend persistence with experimentation. Back off and start afresh with a new approach.\nThink Big Enough to see that defeat is a state of mind, nothing more.\nE. When Romance Starts to Slip, THINK BIG\nNegative, petty, “She’s-(He’s)-unfair-to-me-so-I’ll-get-even” type of thinking slaughters romance,\ndestroys the affection that can be yours. Do this when things aren’t going right in the love department:\n1. Concentrate on the biggest qualities in the person you want to love you. Put little things\nwhere they belong—in second place.\n2. Do something special for your mate—and do it often.\nThink Big Enough to find the secret to marital joys.\nF. When You Feel Your Progress on the Job Is Slowing Down, THINK BIG\nNo matter what you do and regardless of your occupation, higher status, higher pay come from one\nthing: increasing the quality and quantity of your output. Do this:\nThink, “I can do better.” The best is not unattainable. There is room for doing everything better.\nNothing in this world is being done as well as it could be. And when you think, “I can do better,”\nways to do better will appear. Thinking “I can do better” switches on your creative power.\nThink Big Enough to see that if you put service first, money takes care of itself.\nIn the words of Publilius Syrus:\nA wise man will be master of his mind,\nA fool will be its slave."
