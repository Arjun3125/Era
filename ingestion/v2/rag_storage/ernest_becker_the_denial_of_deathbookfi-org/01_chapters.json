    "raw_text": "Preface\n. . .for the time being 1 gave up writing—there is \nalready too much truth in the world—an over­\nproduction which apparently cannot be consumed!\n— O tto Rank1\nThe prospect of death, Dr. Johnson said, wonderfully concentrates \nthe mind. The main thesis of this book is that it does much more \nthan that: the idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal \nlike nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity—activity de­\nsigned largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying \nin some way that it is the final destiny for man. The noted anthro­\npologist A. M. Hocart once argued that primitives were not bothered \nby the fear of death; that a sagacious sampling of anthropological \nevidence would show that death was, more often than not, ac­\ncompanied by rejoicing and festivities; that death seemed to be an \noccasion for celebration rather than fear—much like the traditional \nIrish wake. Hocart wanted to dispel the notion that (compared to \nmodern man) primitives were childish and frightened by reality; \nanthropologists have now largely accomplished this rehabilitation \nof the primitive. But this argument leaves untouched the fact that \nthe fear of death is indeed a universal in the human condition. To \nbe sure, primitives often celebrate death—as Hocart and others have \nshown—because they believe that death is the ultimate promotion, \nthe final ritual elevation to a higher form of life, to the enjoyment \nof eternity in some form. Most modem Westerners have trouble \nbelieving this any more, which is what makes the fear of death so \nprominent a part of our psychological make-up.\nIn these pages I try to show that the fear of death is a universal \nthat unites data from several disciplines of the human sciences, and \nmakes wonderfully clear and intelligible human actions that we \nhave buried under mountains of fact, and obscured with endless\nix\n\f\nX THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nback-and-forth arguments about the “true” human motives. The \nman of knowledge in our time is bowed down under a burden he \nnever imagined he would ever have: the overproduction of truth \nthat cannot be consumed. For centuries man lived in the belief that \ntruth was slim and elusive and that once he found it the troubles \nof mankind would be over. And here we are in the closing decades \nof the 20th century, choking on truth. There has been so much \nbrilliant writing, so many genial discoveries, so vast an extension \nand elaboration of these discoveries—yet the mind is silent as the \nworld spins on its age-old demonic career. I remember reading how, \nat the famous St. Louis World Exposition in 1904, the speaker at \nthe prestigious science meeting was having trouble speaking against \nthe noise of the new weapons that were being demonstrated nearby. \nHe said something condescending and tolerant about this need­\nlessly disruptive play, as though the future belonged to science and \nnot to militarism. World War I showed everyone the priority of \nthings on this planet, which party was playing idle games and \nwhich wasn’t. This year the order of priority was again graphically \nshown by a world arms budget of 204 billion dollars, at a time when \nhuman living conditions on the planet were worse than ever.\nWhy, then, the reader may ask, add still another weighty tome to \na useless overproduction? Well, there are personal reasons, of course: \nhabit, drivenness, dogged hopefulness. And there is Eros, the urge \nto the unification of experience, to form, to greater meaningfulness. \nOne of the reasons, I believe, that knowledge is in a state of useless \noverproduction is that it is strewn all over the place, spoken in a \nthousand competitive voices. Its insignificant fragments are mag­\nnified all out of proportion, while its major and world-historical \ninsights lie around begging for attention. There is no throbbing, \nvital center. Norman O. Brown observed that the great world needs \nmore Eros and less strife, and the intellectual world needs it just as \nmuch. There has to be revealed the harmony that unites many dif­\nferent positions, so that the “sterile and ignorant polemics” can be \nabated.2\nI have written this book fundamentally as a study in harmoniza­\ntion of the Babel of views on man and on the human condition, in \nthe belief that the time is ripe for a synthesis that covers the best \nthought in many fields, from the human sciences to religion. I have"

    "raw_text": "1\nPreface xi\ntried to avoid moving against and negating any point of view, no \nmatter how personally antipathetic to me, if it seems to have in it a \ncore of truthfulness. I have had the growing realization over the \npast few years that the problem of mans knowledge is not to oppose \nand to demolish opposing views, but to include them in a larger \ntheoretical structure. One of the ironies of the creative process is \nthat it partly cripples itself in order to function. I mean that, usually, \nin order to turn out a piece of work the author has to exaggerate \nthe emphasis of it, to oppose it in a forcefully competitive way to \nother versions of truth; and he gets carried away by his own exag­\ngeration, as his distinctive image is built on it. But each honest \nthinker who is basically an empiricist has to have some truth in his \nposition, no matter how extremely he has formulated it. The prob­\nlem is to find the truth underneath the exaggeration, to cut away \nthe excess elaboration or distortion and include that truth where it \nfits.\nA second reason for my writing this book is that I have had more \nthan my share of problems with this fitting-together of valid truths \nin the past dozen years. I have been trying to come to grips with \nthe ideas of Freud and his interpreters and heirs, with what might \nbe the distillation of modem psychology—and now I think I have \nfinally succeeded. In this sense this book is a bid for the peace of \nmy scholarly soul, an offering for intellectual absolution; I feel that \nit is my first mature work.\nOne of the main things I try to do in this book is to present a \nsumming-up of psychology after Freud by tying the whole develop­\nment of psychology back to the still-towering Kierkegaard. I am \nthus arguing for a merger of psychology and mythico-religious per­\nspective. I base this argument in large part on the work of Otto \nRank, and I have made a major attempt to transcribe the relevance \nof his magnificent edifice of thought. This coming-to-grips with \nRanks work is long overdue; and if I have succeeded in it, it prob­\nably comprises the main value of the book.\nRank is so prominent in these pages that perhaps a few words of \nintroduction about him would be helpful here. Frederick Peris once \nobserved that Ranks book Art and Artist was “beyond praise.”3 I \nremember being so struck by this judgment that I went immediately \nto the book: I couldn’t very well imagine how anything scientific\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\ncould be “beyond praise.” Even the work of Freud himself seemed \nto me to be praiseworthy, that is, somehow expectable as a product \nof the human mind. But Peris was right: Rank was—as the young \npeople say—“something else.” You cannot merely praise much of his \nwork because in its stunning brilliance it is often fantastic, gratui­\ntous, superlative; the insights seem like a gift, beyond what is neces­\nsary. I suppose part of the reason—in addition to his genius—was \nthat Ranks thought always spanned several fields of knowledge; \nwhen he talked about, say, anthropological data and you expected \nanthropological insight, you got something else, something more. \nLiving as we do in an era of hyperspecialization we have lost the \nexpectation of this kind of delight; the experts give us manageable \nthrills—if they thrill us at all.\nOne thing that I hope my confrontation of Rank will do is to send \nthe reader directly to his books. There is no substitute for reading \nRank. My personal copies of his books are marked in the covers \nwith an uncommon abundance of notes, underlinings, double ex­\nclamation points; he is a mine for years of insights and pondering. \nMy treatment of Rank is merely an outline of his thought: its \nfoundations, many of its basic insights, and its overall implications. \nThis will be the pale Rank, not the staggeringly rich one of his \nbooks. Also, Ira ProgofFs outline presentation and appraisal of Rank \nis so correct, so finely balanced in judgment, that it can hardly be \nimproved upon as a brief appreciation.4 Rank is very diffuse, very \nhard to read, so rich that he is almost inaccessible to the general \nreader. He was painfully aware of this and for a time hoped that \nAnais Nin would rewrite his books for him so that they would have \na chance to have the effect they should have had. What I give in \nthese pages is my own version of Rank, filled out in my own way, a \nsort of brief “translation” of his system in the hope of making it \naccessible as a whole. In this book I cover only his individual psy­\nchology; in another book I will sketch his schema for a psychology \nof history.\nThere are several ways of looking at Rank. Some see him as a \nbrilliant coworker of Freud, a member of the early circle of psycho­\nanalysis who helped give it broader currency by bringing to it his \nown vast erudition, who showed how psychoanalysis could il­\nluminate cultural history, myth, and legend—as, for example, in his\n\f\nPreface xiii\nMrly work on The Myth of the Birth of the Hero and The Incest- \nM otif* They would go on to say that because Rank was never \nAnalyzed, his repressions gradually got the better of him, and he \nturned away from the stable and creative life he had close to Freud; \nIn his later years his personal instability gradually overcame him, \nand he died prematurely in frustration and loneliness. Others see \nRank as an overeager disciple of Freud, who tried prematurely to \nbe original and in so doing even exaggerated psychoanalytic reduc- \ntionism. This judgment is based almost solely on his 1924 book The \nTrauma of Birth and usually stops there. Still others see Rank as a \nbrilliant member of Freud’s close circle, an eager favorite of Freud, \nwhose university education was suggested and financially helped \nby Freud and who repaid psychoanalysis with insights into many \nfields: cultural history, childhood development, the psychology of \nart, literary criticism, primitive thought, and so on. In short, a sort \nof many-faceted but not-too-well-organized or self-controlled boy- \nwonder—an intellectually superior Theodor Reik, so to speak.\nBut all these ways of summing up Rank are wrong, and we know \nthat they derive largely from the mythology of the circle of psycho­\nanalysts themselves. They never forgave Rank for turning away from \nFreud and so diminishing their own immortality-symbol (to use \nRank's way of understanding their bitterness and pettiness). Ad­\nmittedly, Rank's Trauma of Birth gave his detractors an easy handle \non him, a justified reason for disparaging his stature; it was an \nexaggerated and ill-fated book that poisoned his public image, even \nthough he himself reconsidered it and went so far beyond it. Not \nbeing merely a coworker of Freud, a broad-ranging servant of psy­\nchoanalysis, Rank had his own, unique, and perfectiy thought-out \nsystem of ideas. He knew where he wanted to begin, what body of \ndata he had to pass through, and where it all pointed. He knew \nthese things specifically as regards psychoanalysis itself, which he \nwanted to transcend and did; he knew it roughly, as regards the \nphilosophical implications of his own system of thought, but he was \nnot given the time to work this out, as his life was cut short. He \nwas certainly as complete a system-maker as were Adler and Jung; \nhis system of thought is at least as brilliant as theirs, if not more so \nin some ways. We respect Adler for the solidity of his judgment; \nthe directness of his insight, his uncompromising humanism; we"

The question for the his­\ntorian is, rather, what there was in the nature of the psychoanalytic \nmovement, the ideas themselves, the public and the scholarly mind \nthat kept these corrections so ignored or so separated from the main \nmovement of cumulative scientific thought.\nEven a book of broad scope has to be very selective of the truths \nit picks out of the mountain of truth that is stifling us. Many \nthinkers of importance are mentioned only in passing: the reader \nmay wonder, for example, why I lean so much on Rank and hardly \nmention Jung in a book that has as a major aim the closure of psy­\nchoanalysis on religion. One reason is that Jung is so prominent and \nhas so many effective interpreters, while Rank is hardly known and \nhas had hardly anyone to speak for him. Another reason is that al­\nthough Rank’s thought is difficult, it is always right on the central \nproblems, Jung’s is not, and a good part of it wanders into needless \nesotericism; the result is that he often obscures on the one hand \nwhat he reveals on the other. I can’t see that all his tomes on \nalchemy add one bit to the weight of his psychoanalytic insight.\nA good many phrasings of insight into human nature I owe to \nexchanges with Marie Becker, whose fineness and realism on these \nmatters are most rare. I want to thank (with the customary dis­\nclaimers) Paul Roazen for his kindness in passing Chapter Six \nthrough the net of his great knowledge of Freud. Robert N. Bellah \nread the entire manuscript, and I am very grateful for his general \ncriticisms and specific suggestions; those that I was able to act on \ndefinitely improved the book; as for the others, I fear that they \npose the larger and longer-range task of changing myself.\nX iv THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER ONE\nIntroduction: Muman Nature \nand the Meroie\nIn times such as ours there is a great pressure to come up with con­\ncepts that help men understand their dilemma; there is an urge \ntoward vital ideas, toward a simplification of needless intellectual \ncomplexity. Sometimes this makes for big lies that resolve tensions \nand make it easy for action to move forward with just the rationali­\nzations that people need. But it also makes for the slow disengage­\nment of truths that help men get a grip on what is happening to \nthem, that tell them where the problems really are.\nOne such vital truth that has long been known is the idea of \nheroism; but in “normal” scholarly times we never thought of mak­\ning much out of it, of parading it, or of using it as a central con­\ncept. Yet the popular mind always knew how important it was: as \nWilliam James—who covered just about everything-—remarked at \nthe turn of the century: “mankind’s common instinct for reality . . . \nhas always held the world to be essentially a theatre for heroism/’1 \nNot only the popular mind knew, but philosophers of all ages, and \nin our culture especially Emerson and Nietzsche—which is why we \nstill thrill to them: we like to be reminded that our central calling, \noUr main task on this planet, is the heroic.®\nOne way of looking at the whole development of social science \nsince Marx and of psychology since Freud is that it represents a \nmassive detailing and clarification of the problem of human heroism. \nThis perspective sets the tone for the seriousness of our discussion: \nwe now have the scientific underpinning for a true understanding \nof die nature of heroism and its place in human life. If “mankind’s\n• In the following discussion I am obliged to repeat and sum up things I \nhave written elsewhere (The Birth and Death of Meaning, Second Edition, \nNew York: Free Press, 1971) in order to set the framework for the other \nchapters.\n\f\n2 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ncommon instinct for reality” is right, we have achieved the remark­\nable feat of exposing that reality in a scientific way.\nOne of the key concepts for understanding man’s urge to heroism \nis the idea of “narcissism.” As Erich Fromm has so well reminded \nus, this idea is one of Freud’s great and lasting contributions. Freud \ndiscovered that each of us repeats the tragedy of the mythical Greek \nNarcissus: we are hopelessly absorbed with ourselves. If we care \nabout anyone it is usually ourselves first of all. As Aristotle some­\nwhere put it: luck is when the guy next to you gets hit with the \narrow. Twenty-five hundred years of history have not changed \nman’s basic narcissism; most of the time, for most of us, this is still \na workable definition of luck. It is one of the meaner aspects of \nnarcissism that we feel that practically everyone is expendable ex­\ncept ourselves. We should feel prepared, as Emerson once put it, \nto recreate the whole world out of ourselves even if no one else \nexisted. The thought frightens us; we don’t know how we could do \nit without others—yet at bottom the basic resource is there: we \ncould suffice alone if need be, if we could trust ourselves as Emer­\nson wanted. And if we don’t feel this trust emotionally, still most of \nus would struggle to survive with all our powers, no matter how \nmany around us died. Our organism is ready to fill the world all \nalone, even if our mind shrinks at the thought. This narcissism is \nwhat keeps men marching into point-blank fire in wars: at heart one \ndoesn’t feel that he will die, he only feels sorry for the man next to \nhim. Freud’s explanation for this was that the unconscious does not \nknow death or time: in man’s physiochemical, inner organic recesses \nhe feels immortal.\nNone of these observations implies human guile. Man does not \nseem able to “help” his selfishness; it seems to come from his animal \nnature. Through countless ages of evolution the organism has had \nto protect its own integrity; it had its own physiochemical identity \nand was dedicated to preserving it. This is one of the main problems \nin organ transplants: the organism protects itself against foreign \nmatter, even if it is a new heart that would keep it alive. The pro­\ntoplasm itself harbors its own, nurtures itself against the world, \nagainst invasions of its integrity. It seems to enjoy its own pulsa­\ntions, expanding into the world and ingesting pieces of it. If you \ntook a blind and dumb organism and gave it self-consciousness and\n\f\nIntroduction: Human Nature and the Heroic3\nI name, if you made it stand out of nature and know consciously \nthat it was unique, then you would have narcissism. In man, physio- \nCjhemical identity and the sense of power and activity have become \neonicious.\nIn man a working level of narcissism is inseparable from self- \nPlttem, from a basic sense of self-worth. We have learned, mostly \nfrom Alfred Adler, that what man needs most is to feel secure in his \ni#K»eiteem, But man is not just a blind glob of idling protoplasm, \nbut a creature with a name who lives in a world of symbols and \ndreams and not merely matter. His sense of self-worth is constituted \nlymbolically, his cherished narcissism feeds on symbols, on an ab- \nltract idea of his own worth, an idea composed of sounds, words, \nand images, in the air, in the mind, on paper. And this means that \nman's natural yearning for organismic activity, the pleasures of in­\ncorporation and expansion, can be fed limitiessly in the domain of \nlymbols and so into immortality. The single organism can expand \ninto dimensions of worlds and times without moving a physical limb; \nit can take eternity into itself even as it gaspingly dies.\nIn childhood we see the struggle for self-esteem at its least \ndisguised. The child is unashamed about what he needs and wants \nmost. His whole organism shouts the claims of his natural narcis­\nsism. And this claim can make childhood hellish for the adults \nconcerned, especially when there are several children competing at \nonce for the prerogatives of limitless self-extension, what we might \ncall “cosmic significance.” The term is not meant to be taken lightly, \nbecause this is where our discussion is leading. We like to speak \ncasually about “sibling rivalry,” as though it were some kind of by­\nproduct of growing up, a bit of competitiveness and selfishness of \nchildren who have been spoiled, who haven’t yet grown into a \ngenerous social nature. But it is too all-absorbing and relentless to \nbe an aberration, it expresses the heart of the creature: the desire to \nstand out, to be the one in creation. When you combine natural \nnarcissism with the basic need for self-esteem, you create a creature \nwho has to feel himself an object of primary value: first in the \nuniverse, representing in himself all of life. This is the reason for \nthe daily and usually excruciating struggle with siblings: the child \ncannot allow himself to be second-best or devalued, much less left \nout. “You gave him the biggest piece of candy!” “You gave him\n\f\n4 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nmore juice!” “Here’s a little more, then.” “Now shes got more juice \nthan me!” “You let her light the fire in the fireplace and not me.” \n“Okay, you light a piece of paper^ “But this piece of paper is \nsmaller than the one she lit.” And so on and on. An animal who gets \nhis feeling of worth symbolically has to minutely compare himself \nto those around him, to make sure he doesn’t come off second-best. \nSibling rivalry is a critical problem that reflects the basic human \ncondition: it is not that children are vicious, selfish, or domineering. \nIt is that they so openly express man’s tragic destiny: he must des­\nperately justify himself as an object of primary value in the uni­\nverse; he must stand out, be a hero, make the biggest possible con­\ntribution to world life, show that he counts more than anything or \nanyone else.\nWhen we appreciate how natural it is for man to strive to be a \nhero, how deeply it goes in his evolutionary and organismic con­\nstitution, how openly he shows it as a child, then it is all the more \ncurious how ignorant most of us are, consciously, of what we really \nwant and need. In our culture anyway, especially in modern times, \nthe heroic seems too big for us, or we too small for it. Tell a young \nman that he is entitled to be a hero and he will blush. We disguise \nour struggle by piling up figures in a bank book to reflect privately \nour sense of heroic worth. Or by having only a little better home in \nthe neighborhood, a bigger car, brighter children. But underneath \nthrobs the ache of cosmic specialness, no matter how we mask it in \nconcerns of smaller scope. Occasionally someone admits that he \ntakes his heroism seriously, which gives most of us a chill, as did \nU.S. Congressman Mendel Rivers, who fed appropriations to the \nmilitary machine and said he was the most powerful man since Julius \nCaesar. We may shudder at the crassness of earthly heroism, of \nboth Caesar and his imitators, but the fault is not theirs, it is in the \nway society sets up its hero system and in the people it allows to \nfill its roles. The urge to heroism is natural, and to admit it honest. \nFor everyone to admit it would probably release such pent-up force \nas to be devastating to societies as they now are.\nThe fact is that this is what society is and always has been: a \nsymbolic action system, a structure of statuses and roles, customs \nand rules for behavior, designed to serve as a vehicle for earthly \nheroism. Each script is somewhat unique, each culture has a dif-\n\f\n1\nfcrent hero system. What the anthropologists call “cultural relativity” | \nIs thus really the relativity of hero-systeins the world over. But each I \ncultural system is a dramatization of earthly heroics; each system \ncuts out roles for performances of various degrees of heroism: from \nthe “high” heroism of a Churchill, a Mao, or a Buddha, to the “low” \nheroism of the coal miner, the peasant, the simple priest; the plain, \neveryday, earthy heroism wrought by gnarled working hands guid­\ning a family through hunger and disease.\nIt doesn’t matter whether the cultural hero-system is frankly \nmagical, religious, and primitive or secular, scientific, and civilized.\nIt is still a mythical hero-system in which people serve in order to \n<%rn a feeling of primary value, of cosmic specialness, of ultimate \nusefulness to creation, of unshakable meaning. They earn this feel­\ning by carving out a place in nature, by building an edifice that \nreflects human value: a temple, a cathedral, a totem pole, a sky­\nscraper, a family that spans three generations. The hope and belief \nis that the things that man creates in society are of lasting worth \nand meaning, that they outlive or outshine death and decay, that \nman and his products count. When Norman O. Brown said that \nWestern society since Newton, no matter how scientific or secular \nit claims to be, is still as “religious” as any other, this is what he \nmeant: “civilized” society is a hopeful belief and protest that science, \nmoney and goods make man count for more than any other animal. \nIn this sense everything that man does is religious and heroic, and \nyet in danger of being fictitious and fallible.\nThe question that becomes then the most important one that man j \ncan put to himself is simply this: how conscious is he of what he is 1 \ndoing to earn his feeling of heroism? I suggested that if everyone j \nhonestly admitted his urge to be a hero it would be a devastating I \nrelease of truth. It would make men demand that culture give them j \ntheir due—a primary sense of human value as unique contributors j \nto cosmic life. How would our modern societies contrive to satisfy j \nsuch an honest demand, without being shaken to their foundations? j \nOnly those societies we today call “primitive” provided this feeling \nfor their members. The minority groups in present-day industrial \nsociety who shout for freedom and human dignity are really \nclumsily asking that they be given a sense of primary heroism of \nwhich they have been cheated historically. This is why their in­\nIntroduction: Human Nature and the Heroic 5\n\f\nsistent claims are so troublesome and upsetting: how do we do such \nan \"unreasonable” thing within the ways in which society is now \nset up? “They are asking for the impossible” is the way we usually \nput our bafflement.\nBut the truth about the need for heroism is not easy for anyone \nto admit, even the very ones who want to have their claims recog­\nnized. Theres the rub. As we shall see from our subsequent discus­\nsion, to become conscious of what one is doing to earn his feeling \nof heroism is the main self-analytic problem of life. Everything \npainful and sobering in what psychoanalytic genius and religious \ngenius have discovered about man revolves around the terror of ad­\nmitting what one is doing to earn his self-esteem. This is why \nhuman heroics is a blind drivenness that burns people up; in pas­\nsionate people, a screaming for glory as uncritical and reflexive as \nthe howling of a dog. In the more passive masses of mediocre men \nit is disguised as they humbly and complainingly follow out the \nroles that society provides for their heroics and try to earn their \npromotions within the system: wearing the standard uniforms—but \nallowing themselves to stick out, but ever so little and so safely, with \na little ribbon or a red boutonniere, but not with head and shoul­\nders.\nIf we were to peel away this massive disguise, the blocks of re­\npression over human techniques for earning glory, we would arrive \nat the potentially most liberating question of all, the main problem \nof human life: How empirically true is the cultural hero system that \nsustains and drives men? We mentioned the meaner side of mans \nurge to cosmic heroism, but there is obviously the noble side as \nwell. Man will lay down his life for his country, his society, his \nfamily. He will choose to throw himself on a grenade to save his \ncomrades; he is capable of the highest generosity and self-sacrifice. \nBut he has to feel and believe that what he is doing is truly heroic, \ntimeless, and supremely meaningful. The crisis of modern society \nis precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for \naction that their culture has set up. They don’t believe it is \nempirically true to the problems of their lives and times. We are \nliving a crisis of heroism that reaches into every aspect of our social \nlife: the dropouts of university heroism, of business and career \nheroism, of political-action heroism; the rise of anti-heroes, those\n6 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

The \ngreat perplexity of our time, the churning of our age, is that the \nyouth have sensed—for better or for worse—a great social-historical \ntruth: that just as there are useless self-sacrifices in unjust wars, so \ntoo is there an ignoble heroics of whole societies: it can be the \nviciously destructive heroics of Hitlers Germany or the plain de­\nbasing and silly heroics of the acquisition and display of consumer \ngoods, the piling up of money and privileges that now characterizes \nwhole ways of life, capitalist and Soviet.\nAnd the crisis of society is, of course, the crisis of organized reli­\ngion too: religion is no longer valid as a hero system, and so the youth \nscorn it.

When we see a man bravely facing his own \nextinction we rehearse the greatest victory we can imagine. And so \nthe hero has been the center of human honor and acclaim since \nprobably the beginning of specifically human evolution. But even \nbefore that our primate ancestors deferred to others who were \nextrapowerful and courageous and ignored those who were \ncowardly. Man has elevated animal courage into a cult.\nAnthropological and historical research also began, in the nine­\nteenth century, to put together a picture of the heroic since primi­\ntive and ancient times. The hero was the man who could go into \nthe spirit world, the world of the dead, and return alive. He had \nhis descendants in the mystery cults of the Eastern Mediterranean, \nwhich were cults of death and resurrection. The divine hero of each \nof these cults was one who had come back from the dead. And as \nwe know today from the research into ancient myths and rituals, \nChristianity itself was a competitor with the mystery cults and won \nout—among other reasons—because it, too, featured a healer with \nsupernatural powers who . had risen from the dead. The great \ntriumph of Easter is the joyful shout “Christ has risen!”, an echo of \nthe same joy that the devotees of the mystery cults enacted at their \nceremonies of the victory over death. These cults, as G. Stanley \nHall so aptly put it, were an attempt to attain “an immunity bath” \nfrom the greatest evil: death and the dread of it.4 All historical reli­\ngions addressed themselves to this same problem of how to bear the \nend of life. Religions like Hinduism and Buddhism performed the \ningenious trick of pretending not to want to be reborn, which is a \nsort of negative magic: claiming not to want what you really want \nmost.5 When philosophy took over from religion it also took over \nreligions central problem, and death became the real “muse of \nphilosophy” from its beginnings in Greece right through Heidegger \nand modem existentialism.6\nWe already have volumes of work and thought on the subject, \nfrom religion and philosophy and—since Darwin—from science it­\nself. The problem is how to make sense out of it; the accumulation \nof research and opinion on the fear of death is already too large to \nbe dealt with and summarized in any simple way. The revival of \ninterest in death, in the last few decades, has alone already piled up\n\f\nThe Terror of Death 13\na formidable literature, and this literature does not point in any \nsingle direction.\nThe “Healthy-Minded” Argument\nThere are “healthy-minded” persons who maintain that fear of \nv death is not a natural thing for man, that we are not bom with it. \nAn increasing number of careful studies on how the actual fear of \ndeath develops in the child7 agree fairly well that the child has no \nknowledge of death until about the age of three to five. How could \nhe? It is too abstract an idea, too removed from his experience. He \nlives in a world that is full of living, acting things, responding to \nhim, amusing him, feeding him. He doesn’t know what it means for \nlife to disappear forever, nor theorize where it would go. Only \ngradually does he recognize that there is a thing called death that \ntakes some people away forever; very reluctantly he comes to admit \nthat it sooner or later takes everyone away, but this gradual realiza­\ntion of the inevitability of death can take up until the ninth or tenth \nyear.\nIf the child has no knowledge of an abstract idea like absolute \nnegation, he does have his own anxieties. He is absolutely de­\npendent on the mother, experiences loneliness when she is absent, \nfrustration when he is deprived of gratification, irritation at hunger \nand discomfort, and so on. If he were abandoned to himself his \nworld would drop away, and his organism must sense this at some \nlevel; we call this the anxiety of object-loss. Isn’t this anxiety, then, \na natural, organismic fear of annihilation? Again, there are many \nwho look at this as a very relative matter. They believe that if the \nmother has done her job in a warm and dependable way, the child’s \nnatural anxieties and guilts will develop in a moderate way, and he \nwill be able to place then] firmly under the control of his develop­\ning personality.8 The child who has good maternal experiences will \ndevelop a sense of basic security and will not be subject to morbid \nfears of losing support, of being annihilated, or the like.9 As he \ngrows up to understand death rationally by the a^ge of nine or ten, \nhe will accept it as part of his world view, but the idea will not"

The psychiatrist Rhein- \ngold says categorically that annihilation anxiety is not part of the \nchild’s natural experience but is engendered in him by bad ex­\nperiences with a depriving mother.10 This theory puts the whole \nburden of anxiety onto the child’s nurture and not his nature. \nAnother psychiatrist, in a less extreme vein, sees the fear of death as \ngreatly heightened by the child’s experiences with his parents, by \ntheir hostile denial of his life impulses, and, more generally, by the \nantagonism of society to human freedom and self-expansiveness.11\nAs we will see later on, this view is very popular today in the \nwidespread movement toward unrepressed living, the urge to a new \nfreedom for natural biological urges, a new attitude of pride and \njoy in the body, the abandonment of shame, guilt, and self-hatred. \nFrom this point of view, fear of death is something that society \ncreates and at the same time uses against the person to keep him \nin submission; the psychiatrist Moloney talked about it as a “culture \nmechanism,” and Marcuse as an “ideology.”12 Norman 0. Brown, in \na vastly influential book that we shall discuss at some length, went \nso far as to say that there could be a birth and development of the \nchild in a “second innocence” that would be free of the fear of death \nbecause it would not deny natural vitality and would leave the \nchild fully open to physical living.13\nIt is easy to see that, from this point of view, those who have bad \nearly experiences will be most morbidly fixated on the anxiety of \ndeath; and if by chance they grow up to be philosophers they will \nprobably make the idea a central dictum of their thought—as did \nSchopenhauer, who both hated his mother and went on to pro­\nnounce death the “muse of philosophy.” If you have a “sour” char­\nacter structure or especially tragic experiences, then you are bound \nto be pessimistic. One psychologist remarked to me that the whole \nidea of the fear of death was an import by existentialists and Prot­\nestant theologians who had been scarred by their European ex­\nperiences or who carried around the extra weight of a Calvinist and \nLutheran heritage of life-denial. Even the distinguished psycholo­\ngist Gardner Murphy seems to lean to this school and urges us to \nstudy the person who exhibits the fear of death, who places anxiety \nin the center of his thought; and Murphy asks why the living of life \nin love and joy cannot also be regarded as real and basic.14\n\f\nThe Terror of Death 15\nThe “Morbidly-Minded?* Argument\nThe “healthy-minded” argument just discussed is one side of the \npicture of the accumulated research and opinion on the problem of \nthe fear of death, but there is another side. A large body of people \nwould agree with these observations on early experience and would \nadmit that experiences may heighten natural anxieties and later \nfears, but these people would also claim very strongly that never­\ntheless the fear of death is natural and is present in everyone, that \nit is the basic fear that influences all others, a fear from which no \none is immune, no matter how disguised it may be. William James \nspoke very early for this school, and with his usual colorful realism \nhe called death “the worm at the core” of man’s pretensions to hap­\npiness.15 No less a student of human nature than Max Scheler \nthought that all men must have some kind of certain intuition of \nthis “worm at the core,” whether they admitted it or not.16 Coundess \nother authorities—some of whom we shall parade in the following \npages—belong to this school: students of the stature of Freud, many \nof his close circle, and serious researchers who are not psycho­\nanalysts. What are we to make of a dispute in which there are two \ndistinct camps, both studded with distinguished authorities? Jacques \nChoron goes so far as to say that it is questionable whether it will \never be possible to decide whether the fear of death is or is not the \nbasic anxiety.17 In matters like this, then, the most that one can do \n, is to take sides, to give an opinion based on the authorities that \nseem to him most compelling, and to present some of the compelling \narguments.\nI frankly side with this second school—in fact, /this whole book \nis a network of arguments based on the universality of the fear of \ndeath, or “terror” as I prefer to call it, in order to convey how all- \nconsuming it is when we look it full in the face. The first document \nthat I want to present and linger on is a paper written by the noted \npsychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg; it is an especially penetrating essay \nthat—for succinctness and scope—has not been much improved \nupon, even though it appeared several decades ago.18 Zilboorg says \nthat most people think death fear is absent because it rarely shows \nits true face; but he argues that underneath all appearances fear of \ndeath is universally present:\n\f\nFor behind the sense of insecurity in the face of danger, behind the sense \nof discouragement and depression, there always lurks the basic fear of \ndeath, a fear which undergoes most complex elaborations and manifests \nitself in many indirect ways. ... No one is free of the fear of death. . . . \nThe anxiety neuroses, the various phobic states, even a considerable \nnumber of depressive suicidal states and many schizophrenias amply \ndemonstrate the ever-present fear of death which becomes woven into \nthe major conflicts of the given psychopathological conditions. . . . We \nmay take for granted that the fear of death is always present in our \nmental functioning.19\nHadnt James said the same thing earlier, in his own way?\nLet sanguine healthy-mindedness do its best with its strange power of \nliving in the moment and ignoring and forgetting, still the evil back­\nground is really there to be thought of, and the skull will grin in at the \nbanquet.20\nThe difference in these two statements is not so much in the \nimagery and style as in the fact that Zilboorg’s comes almost a half- \ncentury later and is based on that much more real clinical work, \nnot only on philosophical speculation or personal intuition. But it \nalso continues the straight line of development from James and the \npost-Darwinians who saw the fear of death as a biological and \nevolutionary problem. Here I think he is on very sound ground, and \nI especially like the way he puts the case. Zilboorg points out that \nthis fear is actually an expression of the instinct of self-preservation, \nwhich functions as a constant drive to maintain life and to master \nthe-dangers that threaten life:\nSuch constant expenditure of psychological energy on the business of \npreserving life would be impossible if the fear of death were not as con­\nstant. The very term “self-preservation” implies an effort against some \nforce of disintegration; the affective aspect of this is fear, fear of death.21\nIn other words, the fear of death must be present behind all our \nnormal functioning, in order for the organism to be armed toward \nself-preservation. But the fear of death cannot be present constantly \nin one’s mental functioning, else the organism could not function. \nZilboorg continues:\nl6 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe Terror of Death 17\nIf this fear were as constantly conscious, we should be unable to func­\ntion normally. It must be properly repressed to keep us living with any \nmodicum of comfort. We know very well that to repress means more \nthan to put away and to forget that which was put away and the place \nwhere we put it. It means also to maintain a constant psychological \neffort to keep the lid on and inwardly never relax our watchfulness.22\nAnd so we can understand what seems like an impossible paradox: \nthe ever-present fear of death in the normal biological functioning \nof our instinct of self-preservation, as well as our utter obliviousness \nto this fear in our conscious life:\nTherefore in normal times we move about actually without ever believ­\ning in our own death, as if we fully believed in our own corporeal im­\nmortality. We are intent on mastering death. . . .  A man will say, of \ncourse, that he knows he will die some day, but he does not really care. \nHe is having a good time with living, and he does not think about death \nand does not care to bother about it—but this is a purely intellectual, \nverbal admission. The affect of fear is repressed.23\nThe argument from biology and evolution is basic and has to be \ntaken seriously; I don’t see how it can be left out of any discussion. \nAnimals in order to survive have had to be protected by fear- \nresponses, in relation not only to other animals but to nature itself. \nThey had to see the real relationship of their limited powers to the \ndangerous world in which they were immersed. Reality and fear go \ntogether naturally. As the human infant is in an even more exposed \nand helpless situation, it is foolish to assume that the fear response \nof animals would have disappeared in such a weak and highly sensi­\ntive species. It is more reasonable to think that it was instead \nheightened, as some of the early Darwinians thought: early men \nwho were most afraid were those who were most realistic about \ntheir situation in nature, and they passed on to their offspring a \nrealism that had a high survival value.24 The result was the emer­\ngence of man as we know him: a hyperanxious animal who con­\nstantly invents reasons for anxiety even where there are none.\nThe argument from psychoanalysis is less speculative and has to \nbe taken even more seriously. It showed us something about the \nchild’s inner world that we had never realized: namely, that it was\n\f\nmore filled with terror, the more the child was different from other \nanimals. We could say that fear is programmed into the lower ani­\nmals by ready-made instincts; but an animal who has no instincts \nhas no programmed fears. Man’s fears are fashioned out of the ways \nin which he perceives the world. Now, what is unique about the \nchild’s perception of the world? For one thing, the extreme confu­\nsion of cause-and-effect relationships; for another, extreme unreality \nabout the limits of his own powers. The child lives in a situation of \nutter dependence; and when his needs are met it must seem to him \nthat he has magical powers, real omnipotence. If he experiences \npain, hunger, or discomfort, all he has to do is to scream and he is \nrelieved and lulled by gentle, loving sounds. He is a magician and \na telepath who has only to mumble and to imagine and the world \nturns to his desires.\nBut now the penalty for such perceptions. In a magical world \nwhere things cause other things to happen just by a mere thought or \na look of displeasure, anything can happen to anyone. When the \nchild experiences inevitable and real frustrations from his parents, \nhe directs hate and destructive feelings toward them; and he has no \nway of knowing that malevolent feelings cannot be fulfilled by the \nsame magic as were his other wishes. Psychoanalysts believe that \nthis confusion is a main cause of guilt and helplessness in the child. \nIn his very fine essay Wahl summed up this paradox:\n. . . the socialization processes for all children are painful and frustrating, \nand hence no child escapes forming hostile death wishes toward his \nsocializers. Therefore, none escape the fear of personal death in either \ndirect or symbolic form. Repression is usually . . . immediate and effec­\ntive. .. .25\nThe child is too weak to take responsibility for all this destructive \nfeeling, and he can’t control the magical execution of his desires. \nThis is what we mean by an immature ego: the child doesn’t have \nthe sure ability to organize his perceptions and his relationship to \nthe world; he can’t control his own activity; and he doesn’t have \nsure command over the acts of others. He thus has no real control \nover the magical cause-and-effect that he senses, either inside him­\nself or outside in nature and in others: his destructive wishes could \nexplode, his parents’ wishes likewise. The forces of nature are con­\nl8 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

The \nresult is that the child—at least some of the time—lives with an \ninner sense of chaos that other animals are immune to.26\nIronically, even when the child makes out real cause-and-effect \nrelationships they become a burden to him because he overgen­\neralizes them. One such generalization is what the psychoanalysts \ncall the “talion principle.” The child crushes insects, sees the cat \neat a mouse and make it vanish, joins with the family to make a \npet rabbit disappear into their interiors, and so on. He comes to \nknow something about the power relations of the world but can’t \ngive them relative value: the parents could eat him and make him \nvanish, and he could likewise eat them; when the father gets a \nfierce glow in his eyes as he clubs a rat, the watching child might \nalso expect to be clubbed—especially if he has been thinking bad \nmagical thoughts.\nI don’t want to seem to make an exact picture of processes that \nare still unclear to us or to make out that all children live in the \nsame world and have the same problems; also, I wouldn’t want to \nmake the child’s world seem more lurid than it really is most of the \ntime; but I think it is important to show the painful contradictions \nthat must be present in it at least some of the time and to show how \nfantastic a world it surely is for the first few years of the child’s life. \nPerhaps then we could understand better why Zilboorg said that \nthe fear of death “undergoes most complex elaborations and mani­\nfests itself in many indirect ways.” Or, as Wahl so perfectly put it, \ndeath is a complex symbol and not any particular, sharply defined \nthing to the child:\n. . . the child’s concept of death is not a single thing, but it is rather a \ncomposite of mutually contradictory paradoxes . . . death itself is not only \na state, but a complex symbol, the significance of which will vary from \none person to another and from one culture to another.27\nWe could understand, too, why children have their recurrent night­\nmares, their universal phobias of insects and mean dogs. In their \ntortured interiors radiate complex symbols of many inadmissible \nrealities—terror of the world, the horror of one’s own wishes, the \nfear of vengeance by the parents, the disappearance of things, one’s"

    "raw_text": "20 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nlack of control over anything, really. It is too much for any animal \nto take, but the child has to take it, and so he wakes up screaming \nwith almost punctual regularity during the period when his weak \nego is in the process of consolidating things.\nThe “Disappearance”  of the Fear of Death\nYet, the nightmares become more and more widely spaced, and \nsome children have more than others: we are back again to the \nbeginning of our discussion, to those who do not believe that the \nfear of death is normal, who think that it is a neurotic exaggeration \nthat draws on bad early experiences. Otherwise, they say, how ex­\nplain that so many people—the vast majority—seem to survive the \nflurry of childhood nightmares and go on to live a healthy, more-or- \nless optimistic life, untroubled by death? As Montaigne said, the \npeasant has a profound indifference and a patience toward death \nand the sinister side of life; and if we say that this is because of his \nstupidity, then “let’s all learn from stupidity.”2* Today, when we \nknow more than Montaigne, we would say “let’s all learn from \nrepression”—but the moral would have just as much weight: repres­\nsion takes care of the complex symbol of death for most people.\nBut its disappearance doesn’t mean that the fear was never there. \nThe argument of those who believe in the universality of the innate \nterror of death rests its case mostly on what we know about how \neffective repression is. The argument can probably never be cleanly \ndecided: if you claim that a concept is not present because it is \nrepressed, you can’t lose; it is not a fair game, intellectually, be­\ncause you always hold the trump card. This type of argument makes \npsychoanalysis seem unscientific to many people, the fact that its \nproponents can claim that someone denies one of their concepts be­\ncause he represses his consciousness of its truth.\nBut repression is not a magical word for winning arguments; \nit is a real phenomenon, and we have been able to study many of \nits workings. This study gives it legitimacy as a scientific concept \nand makes it a more-or-less dependable ally in our argument. Foi \none thing, there is a growing body of research trying to get at the\n\f\nThe Terror of Death 21\nconsciousness of death denied by repression that uses psychological \ntests such as measuring galvanic skin responses; it strongly suggests \nthat underneath the most bland exterior lurks the universal anxiety, \nthe “worm at the core.”29\nFor another thing, there is nothing like shocks.in the real world \nto jar loose repressions. Recently psychiatrists reported an increase \nin anxiety neuroses in children as a result of the earth tremors in \nSouthern California. For these children the discovery that life really \nincludes cataclysmic danger was too much for their still-imperfect \ndenial systems—hence open outbursts of anxiety. With adults we \nsee this manifestation of anxiety in the face of impending catastrophe \nwhere it takes the form of panic. Recently several people suffered \nbroken limbs and other injuries after forcing open their airplane’s \nsafety door during take-off and jumping from the wing to the \nground; the incident was triggered by the backfire of an engine. \nObviously underneath these harmless noises other things are rum­\nbling in the creature.\nBut even more important is how repression works: it is not simply \na negative force opposing life energies; it lives on life energies and \nuses them creatively. I mean that fears are naturally absorbed by \nexpansive organismic striving. Nature seems to have built into or­\nganisms an innate healthy-mindedness; it expresses itself in self­\ndelight, in the pleasure of unfolding one’s capacities into the world, \nin the incorporation of things in that world, and in feeding on its \nlimitless experiences. This is a lot of very positive experience, and \nwhen a powerful organism moves with it, it gives contentment. As \nSantayana once put it: a lion must feel more secure that God is on \nhis side than a gazelle. On the most elemental level the organism \nworks actively against its own fragility by seeking to expand and \nperpetuate itself in living experience; instead of shrinking, it moves \ntoward more life.*Also, it does one thing at a time, avoiding need­\nless distractions from all-absorbing activity; in this way, it would \nseem, fear of death can be carefully ignored or actually absorbed in \nthe life-expanding processes. Occasionally we seem to see such a vital \norganism on the human level: I am thinking of the portrait of Zorba \nthe Greek drawn by Nilcos Kazantzakis. Zorba was an ideal of the \nnonchalant victory of all-absorbing daily passion over timidity and \ndeath, and he purged others in his life-affirming flame. But Kazant-\n\f\n22 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nzakis himself was no Zorba—which is partly why the character of \nZorba rang a bit false—nor are most other men. Still, everyone en­\njoys a working amount of basic narcissism, even though it is not a \nlions. The child who is well nourished and loved develops, as we \nsaid, a sense of magical omnipotence, a sense of his own indestructi­\nbility, a feeling of proven power and secure support. He can \nimagine himself, deep down, to be eternal. We might say that his \nrepression of the idea of his own death is made easy for him be­\ncause he is fortified against it in his very narcissistic vitality. This \ntype of character probably helped Freud to say that the unconscious \ndoes not know death. Anyway, we know that basic narcissism is \nincreased when one’s childhood experiences have been securely life- \nsupporting and warmly enhancing to the sense of self, to the feel­\ning of being really special, truly Number One in creation. The result \nis that some people have more of what the psychoanalyst Leon J. \nSaul has aptly called “Inner Sustainment.”30 It is a sense of bodily \nconfidence in the face of experience that sees the person more easily \nthrough severe life crises and even sharp personality changes; it \nalmost seems to take the place of the directive instincts of lower \nanimals. One can’t help thinking of Freud again, who had more \ninner sustainment than most men, thanks to his mother and favor­\nable early environment; he knew the confidence and courage that it \ngave to a man, and he himself faced up to life and to a fatal cancer \nwith a Stoic heroism. Again we have evidence that the complex \nsymbol of fear of death would be very variable in its intensity; it \nwould be, as Wahl concluded, “profoundly dependent upon the \nnature and the vicissitudes of the developmental process.”31 \nBut I want to be careful not to make too much of natural vitality \nand inner sustainment. As we will see in Chapter Six, even the \nunusually favored Freud suffered his whole life from phobias and \nfrom death-anxiety; and he came to fully perceive the world under \nthe aspect of natural terror. I don’t believe that the complex symbol \nof death is ever absent, no matter how much vitality and inner \nsustainment a person has. Even more, if we say that these powers \nmake repression easy and natural, we are only saying the half of it. \nActually, they get their very power from repression. Psychiatrists \nargue that the fear of death varies in intensity depending on the \ndevelopmental process, and I think that one important reason for\n\f\nThe Terror of Death 23\nthis variability is that the fear is transmuted in that process. If the \nchild has had a very favorable upbringing, it only serves all the \nbetter to hide the fear of death. After all, repression is made pos­\nsible by the natural identification of the child with the powers of \nhis parents. If he has been well cared for, identification comes \neasily and solidly, and his parents' powerful triumph over death \nautomatically becomes his. What is more natural to banish ones \nfears than to live on delegated powers? And what does the whole \ngrowing-up period signify, if not the giving over of ones life- \nproject? I am going to be talking about these things all the way \nthrough this book and do not want to develop them in this intro­\nductory discussion. What we will see is that man cuts out for him­\nself a manageable world: he throws himself into action uncritically, \nunthinkingly. He accepts the cultural programming that turns his \nnose where he is supposed to look; he doesn’t bite the world off in \none piece as a giant would, but in small manageable pieces, as a \nbeaver does. He uses all kinds of techniques, which we call the \n‘character defenses”: he learns not to expose himself, not to stand \nout; he learns to embed himself in other-power, both of concrete \npersons and of things and cultural commands; the result is that he \ncomes to exist in the imagined infallibility of the world around him. \nHe doesn’t have to have fears when his feet are solidly mired and \nhis life mapped out in a ready-made maze. All he has to do is to \nplunge ahead in a compulsive style of drivenness in the “ways of \nthe world” that the child learns and in which he lives later as a kind \nof grim equanimity—the “strange power of living in the moment \nand ignoring and forgetting”—as James put it. This is the deeper \nreason that Montaigne’s peasant isn’t troubled until the very end, \nwhen the Angel of Death, who has always been sitting on his \nshoulder, extends his wing. Or at least until he is prematurely \nstartled into dumb awareness, like the “Husbands” in John Cas­\nsavetes’ fine film. At times like this, when the awareness dawns that \nhas always been blotted out by frenetic, ready-made activity, we \nsee the transmutation of repression redistilled, so to speak, and the \nfear of death emerges in pure essence. This is why people have \npsychotic breaks when repression no longer works, when the for­\nward momentum of activity is no longer possible. Besides, the \npeasant mentality is far less romantic than Montaigne would have"

    "raw_text": "24 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nus believe. The peasant’s equanimity is usually immersed in a style \nof life that has elements of real madness, and so it protects him: an \nundercurrent of constant hate and bitterness expressed in feuding, \nbullying, bickering and family quarrels, the petty mentality, the \nself-deprecation, the superstition, the obsessive control of daily life \nby a strict authoritarianism, and so on. As the title of a recent essay \nby Joseph Lopreato has it: “How would you like to be a peasant?”\nWe will also touch upon another large dimension in which the \ncomplex symbol of death is transmuted and transcended by man— \nbelief in immortality, the extension of one’s being into eternity. \nRight now we can conclude that there are many ways that repres­\nsion works to calm the anxious human animal, so that he need not \nbe anxious at all.\nI think we have reconciled our two divergent positions on the \nfear of death. The “environmental” and the “innate” positions are \nboth part of the same picture; they merge naturally into one \nanother; it all depends from which angle you approach the picture: \nfrom the side of the disguises and transmutations of the fear of \ndeath or from the side of its apparent absence. I admit with a sense \nof scientific uneasiness that whatever angle you use, you don’t get \nat the actual fear of death; and so I reluctantly agree with Choron \nthat the argument can probably never be cleanly “won.” Neverthe­\nless something very important emerges: there are different images \nof man that he can draw and choose from.\nOn the one hand, we see a human animal who is partly dead to \nthe world, who is most “dignified” when he shows a certain \nobliviousness to his fate, when he allows himself to be driven \nthrough life; who is most “free” when he lives in secure dependency \non powers around him, when he is least in possession of himself. \nOn the other hand, we get an image of a human animal who is \noverly sensitive to the world, who cannot shut it out, who is thrown \nback on his own meagre powers, and who seems least free to move \nand act, least in possession of himself, and most undignified. Which­\never image we choose to identify with depends in large part upon \nourselves. Let us then explore and develop these images further to \nsee what they reveal to us."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER THREE\nThe Recasting of Some Basic \nPsychoanalytic ideas\nFrom the child of five to myself is but a step. But \nfrom the new-born baby to the child of five is an \nappalling distance. \n— L e o T o lsto i\nNow that we have outlined the argument in the first two chapters, \nit is time to fill in the details. Why exactly is the world so terrible \nfor the human animal? Why do people have such trouble digging \nup the resources to face that terror openly and bravely? To talk \nabout these things takes us right into the heart of psychoanalytic \ntheory and what is now the existential rebirth in psychology; it lays \nbare the nature of man with a clarity and comprehensiveness that \nare truly amazing.\nMans Existential Dilemma\nWe always knew that there was something peculiar about man, \nsomething deep down that characterized him and set him apart \nfrom the other animals. It was something that had to go right to his \ncore, something that made him suffer his peculiar fate, that made it \nimpossible to escape. For ages, when philosophers talked about the \ncore of man they referred to it as his “essence,” something fixed in \nhis nature, deep down, some special quality or substance. But \nnothing like it was ever found; man s peculiarity still remained a \ndilemma. The reason it was never found, as Erich Fromm put it in\n25\n\f\n26 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nan excellent discussion, was that there was no essence, that the \nessence of man is really his paradoxical nature, the fact that he is \nI half animal and half symbolic.1 As we shall see in Chapter Five it \nwas Kierkegaard who forcefully introduced the existential paradox \ninto modern psychology, with his brilliant analysis of the Adam and \nEve myth that had conveyed that paradox to the Western mind for \nall time. In recent times every psychologist who has done vital work \nhas made this paradox the main problem of his thought: Otto Rank \n(to whom I want to devote special chapters later on) more con­\nsistently and brilliantly than anyone else since Kierkegaard, Carl \nJung, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, Ernest Schachtel, Abraham Maslow, \nHarold F. Searles, Norman O. Brown, Laura Peris, and others.\nWe might call this existential paradox the condition of indi­\nviduality within finitude. Man has a symbolic identity that brings \nhim sharply out of nature. He is a symbolic self, a creature with a \nname, a life history. He is a creator with a mind that soars, out to \nspeculate about atoms and infinity, who can place himself imagina­\ntively at a point in space and contemplate bemusedly his own \nplanet. This immense expansion, this dexterity, this ethereality, this \nself-consciousness gives to man literally the status of a small god in \nnature, as the Renaissance thinkers knew.\nYet, at the same time, as the Eastern sages also knew, man is a \nworm and food for worms. This is the paradox: he is out of nature \nand hopelessly in it; he is dual, up in the stars and yet housed in a \nheart-pumping, breath-gasping body that once belonged to a fish \nand still carries the gill-marks to prove it. His body is a material \nfleshy casing that ii alien to him in many ways—the strangest and \nmost repugnant way being that it aches and bleeds and will decay \nand die. Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his \nown splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a \ntowering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet \nin order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever. It is a \nterrifying dilemma to be in and to have to live with. The lower \nanimals are, of course, spared this painful contradiction, as they \nlack a symbolic identity and the self-consciousness that goes with \nit. They merely act and move reflexively as they are driven by their \ninstincts. If they pause at all, it is only a physical pause; inside they \nare anonymous, and even their faces have no name. They live in a\n\f\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas27\nworld without time, pulsating, as it were, in a state of dumb being. \nThis is what has made it so simple to shoot down whole herds of \nbuffalo or elephants. The animals don’t know that death is hap­\npening and continue grazing placidly while others drop alongside \nthem. The knowledge of death is reflective and conceptual, and \nanimals are spared it. They live and they disappear with the same \nthoughtlessness: a few minutes of fear, a few seconds of anguish, \nand it is over. But to live a whole lifetime with the fate of death \nhaunting one’s dreams and even the most sun-filled days—that’s \nsomething else.\nIt is only if you let the full weight of this paradox sink down on \nyour mind and feelings that you can realize what an impossible \nsituation it is for an animal to be in. I believe that those who \nspeculate that a full apprehension of man’s condition would drive \nhim insane are right, quite literally right. Babies are occasionally \nborn with gills and tails, but this is not publicized—instead it is \nhushed up. Who wants to face up fully to the creatures we are, \nclawing and gasping for breath in a universe beyond our ken? I \nthink such events illustrate the meaning of Pascal’s chilling reflec­\ntion: “Men are so necessarily mad that not to be mad would sgK||int \nto anotfier~Fomri)T~im Because the existential\ndualism makes an impossible ^tuition, an excruciating dilemma. \nMad because, as we shall see, everytmng that man does in his \nsymbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque \nfate. He literally drives himself into a blind ...qMivjousness^with. \nsocial games, psychological tricks, personal preoccupations so far ^ \nremoved from the reality of his situation tlj^thejjjire fpKns of \nmadness—agreed madness, shared madness, disguised and dignified \nmadness, but madness all the same. y< CHaracter-traits,” said Sandor \nFerenczi. one of the mtist brillMT“ffinds of Freud’s intimate circle \nof early psychoanalysts, “are secret psychoses.” This is not a smug \nwitticism offered in passing by a young science drunk with its own \nexplanatory power and success; it is a mature scientific judgment of \nthe most devastating self-revelatory kind ever fashioned by man \ntrying to understand himself. Ferenczi had already seen behind the \ntight-lipped masks, the smiling masks, the earnest masks, the \nsatisfied masks that people use to bluff the world and themselves \nabout their secret psychoses. More recently Erich Fromm2 wondered\n\f\n*8 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nwhy most people did not become insane in the face of the existential \ncontradiction between a symbolic self, that seems to give man infinite \nworth in a timeless scheme of things, and a body that is worth about \n98^. How to reconcile the two?\nIn order to understand the weight of the dualism of the human \ncondition, we have to know that the child can’t really handle either \nend of it. The most characteristic thing about him is that he is \nprecocious or premature; his world piles up on him and he piles up \non himself. He has right from the beginning an exquisite sensory \nsystem that rapidly develops to take in all the sensations of his \nworld with an extreme finesse. Add to it the quick development of \nlanguage and the sense of self and pile it all upon a helpless infant \nbody trying vainly to grab the world correctly and safely. The result \nis ludicrous. The child is overwhelmed by experiences of the \ndualism of the self and the body from both areas, since he can be \nmaster of neither. He is not a confident social self, adept manipu­\nlator of symbolic categories of words, thoughts, names, or places,— \nor especially of time, that great mystery for him; he doesn't even \nknow what a clock is. Nor is he a functioning adult animal who can \nwork and procreate, do the serious things he sees happening around \nhim: he can’t “do like father” in any way. He is a prodigy in limbo. \nIn both halves of his experience he is dispossessed, yet impressions \nkeep pouring in on him and sensations keep welling up within him, \nflooding his body. He has to make some kind of sense out of them, \nestablish some kind of ascendancy over them. Will it be thoughts \nover body, or body over thoughts? Not so easy. There can be no \nclearcut victory or straightforward solution of the existential \ndilemma he is in. It is his problem almost right from the beginning \nof his life, yet he is only a child to handle it. Children feel hounded \nby symbols they don’t understand the need of, verbal demands that \nseem picayune, and rules and codes that call them away from their \npleasure in the straightforward expression of their natural energies. \nAnd when they try to master the body, pretend it isn’t there, act \n“like a little man,” the body suddenly overwhelms them, submerges \nthem in vomit or excrement—and the child breaks down in des­\nperate tears over his melted pretense at being a purely symbolic \nanimal. Often the child deliberately soils himself or continues to \nwet the bed, to protest against the imposition of artificial symbolic\n\f\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas\nrules: he seems to be saying that the body is his primary reality \nand that he wants to remain in the simpler physical Eden and not \nbe thrown out into the world of “right and wrong/’ ——\nIn this way we realize directly and poignantly that what we call \nthe child’s character is a modus vivendi achieved after the most \nunequal struggle any animal has to go through; a struggle that the \nchild can never really understand because he doesn’t know what is \nhappening to him, why he is responding as he does, or what is \nreally at stake in the battle. The victory in this kind of battle is truly \nPyrrhic: character is a face that one sets to the world, but it hides \nan inner defeat. The child emerges with a name, a family, a play- \nworld in a neighborhood, all clearly cut out for him. But his insides \nare full of nightmarish memories of impossible battles, terrifying \nanxieties of blood, pain, aloneness, darkness; mixed with limitless \ndesires, sensations of unspeakable beauty, majesty, awe, mystery; \nand fantasies and hallucinations of mixtures between the two, the \nimpossible attempt to compromise between bodies and symbols. We \nshall see in a few pages how sexuality enters in with its very definite \nfocus, to further confuse and complicate the child’s world. To grow \nup at all is to conceal the mass of internal scar tissue that throbs in \nour dreams.\nSo we see that the two dimensions of human existence—the body \nand the self—can never be reconciled seamlessly, which explains \nthe second half of Pascal’s reflection: “not to be mad would amount \nto another form of madness.” Here Pascal proves that great students \nof human nature could see behind the masks of men long before \nscientific psychoanalysis. They lacked clinical documentation but \nthey saw that the coolest repression, the most convincing equa­\nnimity, or the warmest self-satisfaction were accomplished lies both \ntoward the world and to oneself. With the clinical documentation of \npsychoanalytic thought, we got a fairly comprehensive picture of \nhuman character styles—what we can now call “styles of madness” \nafter Pascal. We might say that psychoanalysis revealed to us the \ncomplex penalties of denying the truth of man’s condition, what we \nmight thp, costs of prpAp.nATn^^nffo ftf jfl/iA If we had to offer \n^tEebriefest explanation of all the evil that men have wreaked upon \nthemselves and upon their world since the beginnings of time right \nup until tomorrow, it would be not in terms of mans animal"

But more of this vital idea later.\nThe Meaning of Anality\nA sensitive thinker in the age of Freud has had to live a tortured \nintellectual life—at least this is an autobiographical reflection. There \nseems to be so much truth in the Freudian world view, and at the \nsame time so much of it seems so wrong-headed. The ambiguities \nof Freud’s legacy were not in the wrong ideas that he had, since it \nhas been relatively easy to lay these aside; the problem has been \nin his brilliantly true insights, which were stated in a way that they \nfell just to one side of reality; and we needed an immense amount \nof work and clarification in order to bring the two into line. Actually \nwhat was needed was a framework into which to fit the corpus of \npsychoanalytic insight, so that the truth of it could emerge clearly \nand unambiguously, free of the nineteenth-century reductionism, \ninstinctivism, and biologism that Freud fettered it with. This frame­\nwork is the existential one; reinterpretations of Freud within an ex­\nistential context give his insights their full scientific stature. This \ngoal was recently achieved brilliantly by Norman O. Brown3 in his \nreinterpretation of the idea of “anality” and its central role in psy­\nchoanalytic theory; probably the main value of that book historically \nis that it has reclaimed the most esoteric and inverted of the \nFreudian ideas and has made them the property of the human \nsciences.\nI am tempted to quote lavishly from the analytic riches of \nBrown’s book, but there is no point in repeating what he has al­\nready written. Let us just observe that the basic key to the problem \nof anality is that it reflects the dualism of man’s condition—his self \nand his body. Anality and its problems arise in childhood because \nit is then that the child already makes the alarming discovery that \nhis body is strange and fallible and has a definite ascendancy over \nhim by its demands and needs. Try as he may to take the greatest \nflights of fancy, he must always come back to it. Strangest and\n\f\nmost degrading of all is the discovery that the body has, located in \nthe lower rear and out of sight, a hole from which stinking smells \nemerge and even more, a stinking substance—most disagreeable to \neveryone else and eventually even to the child himself.\nAt first the child is amused by his anus and feces, and gaily \ninserts his finger into the orifice, smelling it, smearing feces on the \nwalls, playing games of touching objects with his anus, and the like. \nThis is a universal form of play that does the serious work of all \nplay: it reflects the discovery and exercise of natural bodily func­\ntions; it masters an area of strangeness; it establishes power and \ncontrol over the deterministic laws of the natural world; and it does \nall this with symbols and fancy.0 With anal play the child is already \nbecoming a philosopher of the human condition. But like all philos­\nophers he is still bound by it, and his main task in life becomes the \ndenial of what the anus represents: that in fact, he is nothing but \nbody so far as nature is concerned. Nature’s values are bodily values, \nhuman values are mental values, and though they take the loftiest \nflights they are built upon excrement, impossible without it, always \nbrought back to it. As Montaigne put it, on the highest throne in the \nworld man sits on his arse. Usually this epigram makes people laugh \nbecause it seems to reclaim the world from artificial pride and snob­\nbery and to bring things back to egalitarian values. But if we push \nthe observation even further and say men sit not only on their arse, \nbut over a warm and fuming pile of their own excrement—thd joke \nis no longer funny. The tragedy of mans dualism, his ludicrous \nsituation, becomes too real. The anus and its incomprehensible, re­\npulsive product represents not only physical determinism and \nboundness, but the fate as well of all that is physical: decay and \ndeath.\nWe now understand that what psychoanalysts have called \n“anality” or anal character traits are really forms of the universal\n0 As anal play is an essential exercise in human mastery, it is better not \ninterfered with. If the adult anxiously cuts it short, then he charges the animal \nfunction with an extra dose of anxiety. It becomes more threatening and has \nto be extra-denied and extra-avoided as an alien part of oneself. This extra- \ngrim denial is what we mean by the “anal character.” An “anal” upbringing, \nthen, would be an affirmation, via intense repression, of the horror of the de­\ngrading animal body as the human burden sans pareil.\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas 31\n\f\n32 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nprotest against accident and death. Seen in this way a large part of \nthe most esoteric psychoanalytic corpus of insights achieves a new \nvitality and meaningfulness. To say that someone is “anal” means \nthat someone is trying extra-hard to protect himself against the \naccidents of life and danger of death, trying to use the symbols of \nculture as a sure means of triumph over natural mystery, trying to \npass himself off as anything but an animah When we comb the \nanthropological literature we find that men everywhere have been \nanal in some basic levels of their cultural strivings; and we find that \nprimitives have often shown the most unashamed anality of all. \nThey have been more innocent about what their real problem is, \nand they have not well disguised their disguise, so to speak, over \nthe fallibilities of the human condition. We read that men of the \nChagga tribe wear an anal plug all their lives, pretending to have \nsealed up the anus and not to need to defecate. An obvious triumph \nover mere physicalness. Or take the widespread practice of segre­\ngating women in special huts during menstruation and all the \nvarious taboos surrounding menstruation: it is obvious that man \nseeks to control the mysterious processes of nature as they manifest \nthemselves within his own body. The body cannot be allowed to \nhave the ascendancy over him.4\nAnality explains why men yearn for freedom from contradictions \nand ambiguities, why they like their symbols pure, their Truth with \na capital “T.” On the other hand, when men really want to protest \nagainst artificialities, when they rebel against the symbolisms of \nculture, they fall back on the physical. They call thoughts down to \nearth, mannerisms back to basic chemistry. A perfect example of \nthis was in the recent “anal” film Brewster McCloud, where speeches, \nofficial badges, and shiny manufactured surfaces were pummeled \nfrom the sky with obliterating excrement. The message was one that \nthe modern filmmakers are making with great daring: calling the \nworld back from hypocrisy by stressing basic things about life and \nthe body. Stanley Kubrick jarred audiences when he showed in 2001 \nhow man stepped out into space like an ape dancing to schmaltzy \nStrauss waltz music; and again in A Clockwork Orange he showed \nhow naturally and satisfyingly a man can murder and rape in tune \nwith the heroic transcendence of Beethoven’s Ninth.\nThe upsetting thing about anality is that it reveals that all culture,"

    "raw_text": "all man’s creative life-ways, are in some basic part of them a fabri­\ncated protest against natural reality, a denial of the truth of the \nhuman condition, and an attempt to forget the pathetic creature \nthat man is. One of the most stunning parts of Brown’s study was \nhis presentation of anality in Jonathan Swift. The ultimate horror \nfor Swift was the fact that the sublime, the beautiful, and the divine \nare inextricable from basic animal functions. In the head of the \nadoring male is the illusion that sublime beauty \"is all head and \nwings, with no bottom to betray” it.5 In one of Swift’s poems a \nyoung man explains the grotesque contradiction that is tearing him \napart:6\nNor wonder how I lost my Wits;\nOh! Caelia, Caelia, Caelia shits!\nIn other words, in Swift’s mind there was an absolute contradiction \n“between the state of being in love and an awareness of the excre- \nmental function of the beloved.”7\nErwin Straus, in his brilliant monograph on obsession,8 similarly \nearlier showed how repulsed Swift was by the animality of the body, \nby its dirt and decay. Straus pronounced a more clinical judgment \non Swift’s disgust, seeing it as part of the typical obsessive’s world­\nview: “For all obsessives sex is severed froift unification and procrea­\ntion. . . . Through the . . . isolation of the genitals from the whole \nof the body, sexual functions are experienced as excretions and as \ndecay.”9 This degree of fragmentation is extreme, but we all see the \nworld through obsessive eyes at least part of the time and to some \ndegree; and as Freud said, not only neurotics take exception to the \nfact that “we are bom between urine and faeces.”10 In this horror of \nthe incongruity of man Swift the poet gives more tormented voice \nto the dilemma that haunts us all, and it is worth summing it up one \nfinal time: Excreting is the curse that threatens madness because it \nshows man his abject finitude, his physicalness, the likely unreality \nof his hopes and dreams. But even more immediately, it represents \nman’s utter bafflement at the sheer non-sense of creation: to fashion \nthe sublime miracle of the human face, the mysterium tremendum \nof radiant feminine beauty, the veritable goddesses that beautiful \nwomen ajre; to bring this out of nothing, out of the void, and make\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas 33\n\f\n34 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nit shine in noonday; to take such a miracle and put miracles again \nwithin it, deep in the mystery of eyes that peer out—the eye that \ngave even the dry Darwin a chill: to do all this, and to combine it \nwith an anus that shits! It is too much. Nature mocks us, and poet> \nlive in torture.\nlFave tried to recapture just a bit of the shock of a scientific and \npoetic discussion of the problem of anality, and if I have succeeded \nin such an offhand way, we can understand what the existential \nparadox means: that what bothers people is really incongruity, life \nas it is. This view leads to a whole re-examination of Freudian \ntheory, not only of the problem of anality, but also of Freud’s \ncentral idea, the Oedipus complex. Let us now linger on this, again \nusing Brown’s brilliant reformulation.\nThe Oedipal Project\nFreud often tended to understand human motives in what can be \ncalled a \"primitive” way. Sometimes so much so that when disciples \nlike Rank and Ferenzci pulled away from him they accused him of \nsimple-mindedness. The accusation is, of course, ludicrous, but there \nis something to it—probably what they were driving at: the dog­\ngedness with which Freud stuck to his stark sexual formulas. No \nmatter how much he changed later in life, he always kept alive the \nletter of psychoanalytic dogma and fought against a watering-down \nof the motives he thought he uncovered. We will understand better \nwhy in a later chapter.\nTake the Oedipus complex. In his early work Freud had said that \nthis complex was the central dynamic in the psychic life. In his \nview, the boy child had innate drives of sexuality and he even \nwanted to possess his mother. At the same time, he knew that his \nfather was his competitor, and he held in check a murderous ag­\ngressiveness toward him. The reason he held it in check was that \nhe knew the father was physically stronger than he and that the \nresult of an open fight would be the father’s victory and the castra­\ntion of the son. Hence the horror of blood, of mutilation, of the \nfemale genitals that seemed to have been mutilated; they testified \nthat castration was a fact.\n\f\nFreud modified his views all through his life, but he never got a \nfull distance away from them. No wonder: they kept being “con­\nfirmed” in some intimate way by the people he studied. There was \nindeed something about the anus and the genitals, the physicalness \nof the family, and its copulations that weighed on the psyche of \nneurotics like an age-old stone. Freud thought that such a heavy \nweight must date from time immemorial, from the first emergence \nof humans out of primate ancestors. He thought that the guilt we \neach feel deep down is connected with a primal crime of patricide \nand incest committed in the dim recesses of prehistory; so deep is \nguilt ingrained, so much is it confused with the body, with sex and \nexcrement, and with the parents. Freud never abandoned his views \nbecause they were correct in their elemental suggestiveness about \nthe human condition—but not quite in the sense that he thought, or \nrather, not in the framework which he offered. Today we realize \nthat all the talk about blood and excrement, sex and guilt, is true \nnot because of urges to patricide and incest and fears of actual \nphysical castration, but because all these things reflect mans horror \nof his own basic animal condition, a condition that he cannot— \nespecially as a child—understand and a condition that—as an adult \n—he cannot accept. The guilt that he feels over bodily processes \nand urges is “pure” guilt: guilt as inhibition, as determinism, as \nsmallness and boundness. It grows out of the constraint of the basic \nanimal condition, the incomprehensible mystery of the body and the \nworld.\nPsychoanalysts have been preoccupied since the turn of the cen­\ntury with the experiences of childhood; but, strangely enough, it \nis only since “just yesterday” that we are able to put together a \nfairly complete and plausible commonsensical picture of why child­\nhood is such a crucial period for man. We owe this picture to many \npeople, including especially the neglected Rank, but it is Norman \nO. Brown who has summed it up more pointedly and definitively \nthan anyone else, I think. As he argued in his own reorientation of \nFreud, the Oedipus complex is not the narrowly sexual problem of \nlust and competitiveness that Freud made out in his early work. \nRather, the Oedipus complex is the Oedipal project, a project that \nsums up the basic problem of the child’s life: whether he will be a \npassive object of fate, an appendage of others, a plaything of the\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas 35"

As Brown put it:\nThe Oedipal project is not, as Freud’s earlier formulations suggest, a \nnatural love of the mother, but as his later writings recognize, a product \nof the conflict of ambivalence and an attempt to overcome that conflict \nby narcissistic inflation. The essence of the Oedipal complex is the project \nof becoming God—in Spinoza’s formula, causa sui. . . .  By the same \ntoken, it plainly exhibits infantile narcissism perverted by the flight from \ndeath.. . .\nIf the child’s major task is a flight from helplessness and oblitera­\ntion, then sexual matters are secondary and derivative, as Brown \nsays:\nThus again it appears that the sexual organizations, pregenital and \ngenital, do not correspond to the natural distribution of Eros in the \nhuman body: they represent a hypercathexis, a supercharge, of particular \nbodily functions and zones, a hypercathexis induced by the fantasies of \nhuman narcissism in flight from death.11\nLet us take these technical gems and spread them out a bit. The \nOedipal project is the flight from passivity, from obliteration, from \ncontingency: the child wants to conquer death by becoming the \nfather of himself, the creator and sustainer of his own life. We saw \nin Chapter Two that the child has an idea of death by the age of \nthree, but long before that he is already at work to fortify himself \nagainst vulnerability. This process begins naturally in the very \nearliest stages of the infant’s life—in what is called the “oral” stage. \nThis is the stage before the child is fully differentiated from \nhis mother in his own consciousness, before he is fully cognizant of his \nown body and its functions—or, as we say technically, before his \nbody has become an object in his phenomenological field. The \nmother, at this time, represents literally the child’s life-world. Dur­\ning this period her efforts are directed to the gratification of the \nchild’s wishes, to automatic relief of his tensions and pains. The \nchild, then, at this time, is simply “full of himself,” an unflinchable \nmanipulator and champion of his world. He lives suffused in his"

His body is his narcissistic project, and he uses it to \ntry to “swallow the world.” The “anal stage” is another way of talk­\ning about the period when the child begins to turn his attention to \nhis own body as an object in his phenomenal field. He discovers it \nand seeks to control it. His narcissistic project then becomes the \nmastery and the possession of the world through self-control.\nAt each stage in the unfolding discovery of his world and the \nproblems that it poses, the child is intent on shaping that world to \nhis own aggrandizement. He has to keep the feeling that he has \nabsolute power and control, and in order to do that he has to culti­\nvate independence of sonle kind, the conviction that he is shaping \nhis own life. That is why Brown, like Rank, could say that the \nOedipal project is “inevitably self-generated in the child and is \ndirected against the parents, irrespective of how the parents be­\nhave.” To put it paradoxically, “children toilet train themselves.”12 \nThe profound meaning of this is that there is no “perfect” way to \nbring up a child, since he “brings himself up” by trying to shape \nhimself into an absolute controller of his own destiny. As this aim \nis impossible, each character is, deeply and in some way, fantastically \nunreal, fundamentally imperfect.

As Brown so well \nsays, the castration complex comes into being solely in confronta­\ntion with the mother. This phenomenon is very crucial, and we must \nlinger a bit on how it happens.\nIt all centers on the fact that the mother monopolizes the child’s \nworld; at first, she is his world. The child cannot survive without \nher, yet in order to get control of his own powers he ha5 to get free \nof her. The mother thus represents two things to the child, and it \nhelps us understand why the psychoanalysts have said that ambiva­\nlence characterizes the whole early growth period. On the one hand \nthe mother is a pure source of pleasure and satisfaction, a secure \npower to lean on. She must appear as the goddess of beauty and \ngoodness, victory and power; this is her “light” side, we might say, \nand it is blindly attractive. But on the other hand the child has to \nstrain against this very dependency, or he loses the feeling that he \nhas aegis over his own powers. That is another way of saying that \nthe mother, by representing secure biological dependence, is also a \nfundamental threat.\nThe child comes to perceive her as a threat, which is already the \nbeginning of the castration complex in confrontation with her. The \nchild observes that the mother’s body is different from the male’s— \nstrikingly different. And this difference gradually comes to make \nhim very uncomfortable. Freud never tried to ease the shock of the \nrevelations of his theory, and he called this discomfort “horror at \nthe mutilated creature,” the “castrated mother,” the sight of genitals \n“devoid of a penis.” Freud’s shock effect seemed to many people to \npartake of caricature. The horror in the child’s perceptions seemed \ntoo contrived, too pat, too much designed to fit into Freud’s own \naddiction to sexual explanations and biological reductionism. Others, \ntoo, saw Freud’s way of thinking as a reflection of his own ingrained \npatriarchy, his strong sense of masculine superiority, which made \nthe woman seem naturally inferior if she lacked male appendages.\nThe fact is that the “horror at the mutilated creature” is contrived, \nbut it is the child who contrives it. Psychoanalysts reported faith­\nfully what their neurotic patients told them, even if they had to pry \njust the right words into their expressions. What troubles neurotics \n—as it troubles most people—is their own powerlessness; they must"

    "raw_text": "find something to set themselves against. If the mother represents \nbiological dependence, then the dependence can be fought against \nby focussing it on the fact of sexual differentiation. If the child is \nto be truly causa sui, then he must aggressively defy the parents in \nsome way, move beyond them and the threats and temptations they \nembody. The genitals are a small thing in the child’s perceptual \nworld; hardly enough to be traumatic just because they lack protu­\nberance. As Brown so well put it, the horror is the child’s “own \ninvention; it is a tissue of fantasy inseparable from his own fantastic \nproject of becoming father of himself (and, as fantasy, only re­\nmotely connected with actual sight of the female genitalia).”15 Or, \nput another way, we can say that the child “fetishizes” the mother’s \nbody as an object of global danger to himself. It is one way of cut­\nting her down to size, depriving her of her primary place in crea­\ntion. Using Erwin Straus’ formula, we would say that the child \nsplits the mother’s genitals off from her totality as a love-object; \nthey then come to be experienced as a threat, as decay.\n//\nPenis-Envy\nThe real threat of the mother comes to be connected with her \nsheer physicalness. Her genitals are used as a convenient focus for \nthe child’s obsession with the problem of physicalness. If the mother \nis a goddess of light, she is also a witch of the dark. He sees her tie \nto the earth, her secret bodily processes that bind her to nature: the \nbreast with its mysterious sticky milk, the menstrual odors and \nblood, the almost continual immersion of the productive mother in \nher corporeality, and not least—something the child is very sensitive \nto—the often neurotic and helpless character of this immersion. \nAfter the child gets hints about the mother’s having babies, sees \nthem being nursed, gets a good look at the toiletful of menstrual \nblood that seems to leave the witch quite intact and unconcerned, \nthere is no question about her immersion in stark body-meanings \nand body-fallibilities. The mother must exude determinism, and the \nchild expresses his horror at his complete dependency on what is \nphysically vulnerable. And so we understand not only the boy’s\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas 39\n\f\n40 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\npreferance for masculinity but also the girls “penis-envy.” Both \nboys and girls succumb to the desire to flee the sex represented by \nthe mother;16 they need little coaxing to identify with the father and \nhis world. He seems more neutral physically, more cleanly power­\nful, less immersed in body determinisms; he seems more “sym­\nbolically free,” represents the vast world outside of the home, the \nsocial world with its organized triumph over nature, the very escape \nfrom contingency that the child seeks.f\nBoth the boy and girl turn away from the mother as a sort of \nautomatic reflex of their own needs for growth and independence. \nBut the “horror, terror, contempt”17 they feel is, as we said, part of \ntheir own fantastic perceptions of a situation thev can’t stand. This \nsituation is not only the biological dependency and phvsicalness \nrepresented by the mother, but also the terrible revelation of the \nproblem of the child’s own body. The mother’s body not only\nf Penis-envy, then, arises from the fact that the mothers genitals have been \nsplit off from her body as a focalization of the problem of decay and vulnera­\nbility. Bernard Brodsky remarks about his female patient: “Her concept of \nwoman as fecal greatly stimulated her penis envy, since the lively erectile \npenis was the antonym of the dead, inert stool.” (B. Brodsky, \"The Self- \nRepresentation, Anality, and the Fear of Dying,” Journal of the American \nPsychoanalytic Association, 1959 , Volume 7, p. 102 .) Phyllis Greenacre—out­\nstanding student of the child’s experiences—had already remarked on this same \nequation in the child’s perception: penis = movement, therefore life; feces = \ninertia, therefore death. (P. Greenacre, Trauma, Growth and Personality, New \nYork: Norton, 1952 , p. 264.) This makes penis-envy very natural. Greenacre \neven used the apt idea of “penis-awe” to refer to the spell that the large male \nappendage can cast in the child’s perceptions of the father. The child, after all, \nlives in a world of body-power predominantly—he doesn’t understand abstract \nor symbolic power. So, more body equals more life. A grown woman might \nwell experience a lingering of the same feeling. An indentation and lack of \nprotuberance, with all that goes on inside, is different from an aggressive ex­\ntension that must give less of a feeling of vulnerability.\nBrodsky’s patient, as we might expect, was in trouble because both dimen­\nsions of her ambivalence toward her mother were heightened, the patient’s \nneed of her mother and the mother’s threat to the patient: “The mother’s \noverprotection and hindrance of the patient’s gaining motor skills contributed \nto the faulty development of the self-image. She had both intense separation \nanxiety and marked castration anxiety.” In other words, her dependency was \nintensified, and at the same time it intensified her castration anxiety, as she \ncould not break away from an object that represented decay. This is an almost \nsure formula for clinical neurosis.\n\f\nreveals a sex that threatens vulnerability and dependency—it re­\nveals much more: it presents the problem of two sexes and so con­\nfronts the child with the fact that his body is itself arbitrary. It is \nnot so much that the child sees that neither sex is “complete” in \nitself or that he understands that the particularity of each sex is a \nlimitation of potential, a cheating of living fulness in some ways— \nhe cant know these things or fully feel them. It is again not a sexual \nproblem; it is more global, experienced as the curse of arbitrariness \nthat the body represents. The child comes upon a world in which \nhe could just as well have been born male or female, even dog, cat, \nor fish—for all that it seems to matter as regards power and control, \ncapacity to withstand pain, annihilation, and death. The horror of \nsexual differentiation is a horror of “biological fact,” as Brown so \nwell says.1* It is a fall out of illusion into sobering reality. It is a \nhorror of assuming an immense new burden, the burden of the \nmeaning of life and the body, of the fatality of ones incompleteness, \nhis helplessness, his finitude.\nAnd this, finally, is the hopeless terror of the castration complex \nthat makes men tremble in their nightmares. It expresses the realiza­\ntion by the child that he is saddled with an impossible project; that \nthe causa-sui pursuit on which he is launched cannot he achieved \nby body-sexual means,19 even by protesting a body different from \nthe mother. The fortress of the body, the primary base for narcis­\nsistic operations against the world in order to insure ones boundless \npowers, crumbles like sand. This is the tragic dethroning of the \nchild, the ejection from paradise that the castration complex repre­\nsents. Once he used any bodily zone or appendage for his Oedipal \nproject of self-generation; now, the very genitals themselves mock \nhis self-sufficiency.\nThis brings up the whole matter of why sexuality is such a uni­\nversal problem. No one has written about the problem of sexuality \nbetter than Rank in his stunning essay on “Sexual Enlightenment.”20 \nAs I am going to talk about it in some detail in Chapter Eight, there \nis no point in repeating that discussion here. But we can anticipate \nit by showing how sexuality is inseparable from our existential \nparadox, the dualism of human nature. The person is both a self and \na body^ and from the beginning there is the confusion about where \n“he” really “is”—in the symbolic inner self or in the physical body. \nEach phenomenological realm is different. The inner self represents\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas 41\n\f\n42 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nthe freedom of thought, imagination, and the infinite reach of sym­\nbolism. The body represents determinism and boundness. The child \ngradually learns that his freedom as a unique being is dragged back \nby the body and its appendages which dicate “what” he is. For this \nreason sexuality is as much a problem for the adult as for the child-, \nthe physical solution to the problem of who we are and why we \nhave emerged on this planet is no help—in fact, it is a terrible \nthreat. It doesn’t tell the person what he is deep down inside, what \nkind of distinctive gift he is to work upon the world. This is why it \nis so difficult to have sex without guilt: guilt is there because the \nbody casts a shadow on the person’s inner freedom, his “real self” \nthat—through the act of sex—is being forced into a standardized, \nmechanical, biological role. Even worse, the inner self is not even \nbeing called into consideration at all; the body takes over com­\npletely for the total person, and this kind of guilt makes the inner \nself shrink and threaten to disappear.\nThis is why a woman asks for assurance that the man wants “me” \nand not “only my body”; she is painfully conscious that her own \ndistinctive inner personality can be dispensed with in the sexual act. \nIf it is dispensed with, it doesn’t count. The fact is that the man \nusually does want only the body, and the woman’s total personality \nis reduced to a mere animal role. The existential paradox vanishes, \nand one has no distinctive humanity to protest. One creative way \nof coping with this is, of course, to allow it to happen and to go \nwith it: what the psychoanalysts call “regression in the service of \nthe ego.” The person becomes, for a time, merely his physical sdl'f \nand so absolves the painfulness of the existential paradox and the \nguilt that goes with sex. Love is one great key to this kind of \nsexuality because it allows the collapse of the individual into the \nanimal dimension without fear and guilt, but instead with trust and \nassurance that his distinctive inner freedom will not be negated by \nan animal surrender.\nThe Primal Scene\nThis is the right place to discuss another psychoanalytic idea that \nalways seemed to many to bypass credulity, the so-called “trauma \nof the primal scene.” The orthodox psychoanalytic notion was that\n\f\nThe Recasting of Some Basic Psychoanalytic Ideas43\nwhen the child witnessed sexual intercourse between the parents \n(the primal scene) it left him with a deep-seated trauma because he \ncould not take part in it. Freud talked about the actual “stimula­\ntion of sexual excitement upon observation of parental coitus/'21 Put \nso bluntly the idea seems incredible enough, but we must remember \nthat Freud prided himself above all on the discovery of infantile \nsexuality^. In the minds of other psychoanalysts the idea Is glverTa \nslightly different emphasis. Thus, as Roheim put it, the primal scene \nrepresents the child’s wish for reunion with the mother fulfilled; but \nhe sees his father in his place, and instead of a complete identifica­\ntion with the succoring mother he sees the “violent motion” of a \nstruggle.22 Finally, Ferenczi—who was a keen student of the effects \nof the parents on the child—gives the matter another slighdy dif­\nferent twist from Freud’s stark formulation:\nI\nlf intimate parental intercourse is observed by the child in the first or \nsecond year of life, when its capacity for excitement is already there but \nit lacks as yet adequate outlets for its emotion, an infantile neurosis may \nresult.23\nRoheim and Ferenczi, then, are actually talking about quite dif­\nferent things from Freud’s subject. Roheim is talking about identifi­\ncation with the mother, who represents the total support of the \nchild, and the child’s inability to understand the relation of his \nloved object with other objects like the father. Ferenczi is saying \nthat the child is overwhelmed by emotions that he cannot yet or­\nganize. This is precisely where a more existential interpretation of \nthe problem comes in. The child uses his body as his causa-sui \nproject; he only definitely abandons this project when he learns the \nimpossibility of it. Each of these alternatives is a life-and-death \nmatter for him; and so, if we are going to talk about trauma, it \nmust be because of a confusion of life-and-death matters. Even \nwhen we are grown, most of us experience some distaste and disillu­\nsionment at the idea of our parents having intercourse; it doesn’t \nseem the “right” thing for them to do. I think the exact reason for \nour distaste is that their image is confounded in our eyes. The \nthing that the parents represent most of all is the discouragement \nof the body as a causa-sui project^ thejf represenJUth© castration \ncomplex, disillusionment with the body, and the fear of it. Even\n\f\n44 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nmore, they themselves are the living embodiment of the cultural \nworld view that the child has to internalize in order for him to get \nout of his impasse with his body. When they themselves do not \ntranscend the body in their most intimate relations, the child must \nexperience some anxious confusion. How is his struggling ego to \nhandle these double messages and make sense out of them? Further­\nmore, one of these messages is given in concrete physical grunts, \ngroans, and movement that must be overwhelming, especially as it \nis precisely the horror of the body that the child is trying to over­\ncome. If he tries to fall back on the body role and imitate his \nparents, they become anxious or furious. He can well feel betrayed \nby them: they reserve their bodies for the closest relationship but \ndeny it to him. They discourage physicalness with all the powers \nat their command, and yet they themselves practice it with an all- \nabsorbing vengeance. When we take all this together we can see \nthat the primal scene can truly be a trauma, not because the child \ncan t get into the sexual act and express his own impulses but rather \nbecause the primal scene is itself a complex symbol combining the \nhorror of the body, the betrayal of the cultural superego, and the \nabsolute blockage of any action that the child can take in the situa­\ntion or any straightforward understanding that he can have of it. It \nis the symbol of an anxious multiple bind.\nThe body, then, is one’s animal fate that has to be struggled \nagainst in some ways. At the same time, it offers experiences and \nsensations, concrete pleasure that the inner symbolic world lacks. \nNo wonder man is impaled on the horns of sexual problems, why \nFreud saw that sex was so prominent in human life—especially in \nthe neurotic conflicts of his patients. Sex is an inevitable component \nof man’s confusion over the meaning of his life, a meaning split \nhopelessly into two realms—symbols (freedom) and body (fate). \nNo wonder, too, that most of us never abandon entirely the early \nattempts of the child to use the bo$y and its appendages as a \nfortress or a machine to magically coerce the world. We try to get \nmetaphysical answers out of the body that the body—as a material \nthing—cannot possibly give. We try to answer the transcendent \nmystery of creation by experiences in one, partial, physical product \nof that creation. This is why the mystique of sex is so widely prac­\nticed—say, in traditional France—and at the same time is so dis-"

Sex is also a positive way \nof working on one’s personal freedom project. After all, it is one of \nthe few areas of real privacy that a person has in an existence that \nis almost wholly social, entirely shaped by the parents and society. \nIn this sense, sex as a project represents a retreat from the standard­\nizations and monopolizations of the social world. .No wonder people \ndedicate themselves so all-consumingly to it, often from childhood \non in the form of secret masturbations that represent a protest and \na triumph of the personal self.. As we will see in Part II of this book, \nRank goes so far as to say that this use of sex explains all sexual \nconflicts in the individual—“from masturbation to the most varied \nperversions.”25 The person attempts to use his sex in an entirely in­\ndividual way in order to control it and relieve it of its determinism. ^ \nIt is as though one tried to transcend the body by depriving it en­\ntirely of its given character, to make sport and new invention in \nplace of what nature “intended.” The “perversions” of children \ncertainly show this very clearly: they are the true artists of the \nbody, using it as clay to assert their symbolic mastery. Freud saw \n/ this and recorded it as “polymorphous perversity”—which is one \nj way of talking about it. But he seems not to have realized that this \np kind of play is already a very serious attempt to transcend deter­\nminism, not merely an animal search for a variety of body-zone \npleasures.\nBy the time the child grows up, the inverted search for a personal \nexistence through perversity gets set in an individual mold, and it \nbecomes more secret. It has to be secret because the community \nwon’t stand for the attempt by people to wholly individualize them­\nselves.26 If there is going to be a victory over human incompleteness \nand limitation, it has to be a social project and not an individual"

This question goes right to the heart of the human condition, \nand we shall be attacking it from many sides all through this book. \nI once wrote2 that I thought the reason man was so naturally \ncowardly was that he felt he had no authority; and the reason he \nhad no authority was in the very nature of the way the human \nanimal is shaped: all our meanings are built into us from the out­\nside, from our dealings with others. This is what gives us a “self” \nand a superego. Our whole world of right and wrong, good and \nbad, our name, precisely who we are, is grafted into us; and we \nnever feel we have authority to offer things on our own. How could \nwe?—I argued—since we feel ourselves in many ways guilty and \nbeholden to others, a lesser creation of theirs, indebted to them for \nour very birth.\nBut this is only part of the story—the most superficial and obvious \npart. There are deeper reasons for our lack of courage, and if we \nare going to understand man we have to dig for them. The psy­\nchologist Abraham Maslow had the keenest sense for significant \nideas, and shortly before his recent untimely death he began to \nattack the problem of the fear of standing alone.3 Maslow used a \nbroad humanistic perspective in his work, and he liked to talk about \nconcepts like “actualizing one’s potential” and one’s “full human­\nness.” He saw these as natural developmental urges and wondered \nwhat holds them up, what blocks them. He answered the question \nin existential language, using terms like the “fear of one’s own \ngreatness” and the “evasion of one’s destiny.” This approach throws \na new light on the problem of courage. In his words:\nWe fear our highest possibility (as well as our lowest ones). We are \ngenerally afraid to become that which we can glimpse in our most per­\nfect moments. . . . We enjoy and even thrill to the godlike possibilities \nwe see in ourselves in such peak moments. And yet we simultaneously \nshiver with weakness, awe and fear before these very same possibilities.4\nMaslow used an apt term for this evasion of growth, this fear of \nrealizing one’s own fullest powers. He called it the “Jonah Syn­\ndrome.” He understood the syndrome as the evasion of the full in­\ntensity of life:"

The world as \nit is, creation out of the void, things as they are, things as they are \nnot, are too much for us to be able to stand. Or, better: they would \nbe too much for us to bear without crumbling in a faint, trembling \nlike a leaf, standing in a trance in response to the movement, colors, \nand odors of the world. I say “would be” because most of us—by \nthe time we leave childhood—have repressed our vision of the \nI primary miraculousness of creation. We have closed it off, changed \nit, and no longer perceive the world as it isjbo raw experience.. Some­\ntimes we may recapture this world by remembering some striking \nchildhood perceptions, how suffused they were in emotion and \nwonder—how a favorite grandfather looked, or ones first love in \nhis early teens. We change these heavily emotional perceptions \nprecisely because we need to move about in the world with some \nkind of equanimity, some kind of strength and directness; we can't \nkeep gaping with our heart in our mouth, greedily sucking up with \nour eyes everything great and powerful that strikes us. The great \nboon of repression is that it makes it possible to live decisively in \nan overwhelmingly miraculous and incomprehensible world, a world \nso full of beauty, majesty, and terror that if animals perceived it all \nthey would be paralyzed to act.\nBut nature has protected the lower animal by endowing them \nwith instincts. An instinct is a programmed perception that calls \ninto play a programmed reaction. It is very simple. Animals are not \nmoved by what they cannot react to.

He lives not only on a tiny ter­\nritory, nor even on an entire planet, but in a galaxy, in a universe, \nand in dimensions beyond visible universes. It is appalling, the \nburden that man bears, the experiential burden. As we saw in the \nlast chapter, man can’t even take his own body for granted as can \nother animals. It is not just hind feet, a tail that he drags, that are \njust “there,” limbs to be used and taken for granted or chewed off \nwhen caught in a trap and when they give pain and prevent move­\nment. Mans body is a problem to him that has to be explained. Not \nonly his body is strange, but also its inner landscape, the memories \nand dreams. Mans very insides—his self—are foreign to him. He \ndoesn't know who he is, why he was born, what he is doing on the \nplanet, what he is supposed to do, what he can expect. His own \nexistence is incomprehensible to him, a miracle just like the rest of \ncreation, closer to him, right near his pounding heart, but for that \nreason all the more strange. Each thing is a problem, and man can \nshut out nothing. As Maslow has well said, “It is precisely the god­\nlike in ourselves that we are ambivalent about, fascinated by and \nfearful of, motivated to and defensive against. This is one aspect of \nthe basic human predicament, that we are simultaneously worms \nand gods.”7 There it is again: gods with anuses.\nThe historic value of Freuds work is that it came to grips with \nthe peculiar animal that man was, the animal that was not pro­\ngrammed by instincts to close off perception and assure automatic \nequanimity and forceful action. Man had to invent and create out \nof himself the limitations of perception and the equanimity to live \non this planet. And so the core of psychodynamics, the formation \nof the human character, is a study in human self-limitation and in \nthe terrifying costs of that limitation, The hostility to psychoanalysis \nin the past, today, and in the future, will always be a hostility \nagainst admitting that man lives by lying to himself ^abput himseljL \nand about his world, and that.. charac^io.iolto.-E^eiKad^aBd- \nBrown, is a vital lie. I particularly like the way Maslow ha^-summed \nup this contribution of Freudian thought:\nFreud’s greatest discovery, the one which lies at the root of psycho­\ndynamics, is that the great cause of much psychological illness is the fear \nof knowledge of oneself—of one’s emotions, impulses, memories, ca-\n\f\n5* THE DENIAL OF DEATH\npacities, potentialities, of ones destiny. We have discovered that fear of \nknowledge of oneself is very often isomorphic with, and parallel with, \nfear of the outside world.\nAnd what is this fear, but a fear of the reality of creation in rela­\ntion to our powers and possibilities:\nIn general this kind of fear is defensive, in the sense that it is a protec­\ntion of our self-esteem, of our love and respect for ourselves. We tend \nto be afraid of any knowledge that could cause us to despise ourselves \nor to make us feel inferior, weak, worthless, evil, shameful. We protect \nourselves and our ideal image of ourselves by repression and similar de­\nfenses, which are essentially techniques by which we avoid becoming \nconscious~oTTm^^ntlir^ai^iiau^ud^^ —\nThe individual has to repress globally, from the entire spectrum \nof his experience, if he wants to feel a warm sense of inner value \nand basic security. This sense of value and support is something \nthat nature gives to each animal by the automatic instinctive pro­\ngramming and in the pulsating of the vital processes. But man, \npoor denuded creature, has to build and earn inner value and \nsecurity. He must repress his smallness in the adult world, his \nfailures to live up to adult commands and codes. He must repress \nhis own feelings of physical and moral inadequacy, not only the \ninadequacy of his good intentions but also his guilt and his evil \nintensions: the death wishes and hatreds that result from being \nfrustrated and blocked by the adults. He must repress his parents’ \ninadequacy, their anxieties and terrors, because these make it dif­\nficult for him to feel secure and strong. He must repress his own \nanality, his compromising bodily functions that spell his mortality, \nhis fundamental expendability in nature. And with all this, and more \nthat we leave unsaid, he must repress the primary awesomeness of \nthe external world.\nr ln his later years Freud evidently came to realize, as Adler had \nearlier, that the thing that really bothers the child is the nature of \nhis world, not so much his own inner drives. He talked less about \nthe power of the Oedipus complex and more about “human per­\nplexity and helplessness in the face of natures dreaded forces,” “the \nterrors of rAture,” “the painful riddle of death,” “our anxiety in the"

Anxiety was \nnow seen largely as a matter of the reaction to global helplessness, \nabandonment, fate:\nI therefore maintain that the fear of death is to be regarded as an \nanalogue of the fear of castration, and that the situation to which the \nego reacts is the state of being forsaken or deserted by the protecting \nsuperego—by the powers of destiny—which puts an end to security \nagainst every danger.10\nThis formulation indicates a great broadening of perspective. Add \nto it a generation or two of psychoanalytic clinical work, and we \nhave achieved a remarkably faithful understanding of what really \nbothers the child, how life is really too much for him, how he has \nto avoid too much thought, too much perception, too much life. And \nat the same time, how he has to avoid the death that rumbles \nbehind and underneath every carefree activity, that looks over his \nshoulder as he plays. The result is that we now know that the human \nanimal is characterized by two great fears that other animals are \nprotected from: the fear of lifejand the fear of death. In the science \nof man it was Otto Rank, above all, who brought these fears into \nprominence, based his whole system of thought on them, and \nshowed how central they were to an understanding of man. At about \nthe same time that Rank wrote, Heidegger brought these fears to \nthe center of existential philosophy. He argued that the basic \nanxiety of man is anxiety about being-in-the-world, as well as \nanxiety of being-in-the-world. That is, both fear of death and fear \nof life, of experience and individuation.11 Man is reluctant to move \nout into the overwhelmingness of his world, the real dangers of it; \nhe shrinks back from losing himself in the all-consuming appetites \nof others, from spinning out of control in the clutchings and claw- \nings of men, beasts and machines. As an animal organism man \nsenses the kind of planet he has been put down on, the nightmarish, \ndemonic frenzy in which nature has unleashed billions of individual\n\f\n54 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\norganismic appetites of all kinds—not to mention earthquakes, \nmeteors, and hurricanes, which seem to have their own hellish ap­\npetites. Each thing, in order to deliciously expand, is forever gob­\nbling up others. Appetites may be innocent because they are naturally \ngiven, but any organism caught in the myriad cross-purposes of this \nplanet is a potential victim of this very innocence—and it shrinks \naway from life lest it lose its own. Life can suck one up, sap his \nenergies, submerge him, take away his self-control, give so much \nnew experience so quickly that he will burst; make him stick out \namong others, emerge onto dangerous ground, load him up with \nnew responsibilities which need great strength to bear, expose him \nto new contingencies, new chances. Above all there is the danger of \na slip-up, an accident, a chance disease, and of course of death, the \nfinal sucking up, the total submergence and negation.\nThe great scientific simplification of psychoanalysis is the concept \nthat the whole of early experience is an attempt by the child to \ndeny the anxiety of his emergence, his fear of losing his support, of \nstanding alone, helpless and afraid. The child’s character, his style \nof life, is his way of using the power of others, the support of the \nthings and the ideas of his culture, to banish from his awareness \nthe aetuaLfact of hisjiatural impotence.

The only way he could securely oppose \nthem would be to know that he is as godlike as they, but he can \nnever know this straightforwardly and unambiguously.

One s own face \nmay be godlike in its miraculousness, but one lacks the godlike \npower to know what it means, the godlike strength to have been \nresponsible for its emergence.\nIn these ways, then, we understand that if the child were to give \nin to the overpowering character of reality and experience he would \nnot be able to act with the kind of equanimity we need in our non- \ninstinctive world. So one of the first things a child has to do is to \nlearn to “abandon ecstasy,” to do without awe, to leave fear and \ntrembling behind. Only then can he act with a certain oblivious gelf- , \nconfidence, when he has naturalized his world. We say “naturalized”!\n\" buF^e~mean unnaturalized, falsified, with the truth obscured, the \" \ndespair of the human condition hidden, a despair that the child \nglimpses in his night terrors and daytime phobias and neuroses. \nThis despair he avoids by building defenses; and these defenses \nallow him to feel a basic sense of self-worth, of meaningfulness, of I \npower. They allow him to feel that he controls his life and his death, \nthat he really does live and act as a willful and free individual, that \nhe has a unique and self-fashioned identity, that he is somebody— ' \nnot just a trembling accident germinated on a hothouse planet that \nCarlyle for all time called a “hall of doom.” We called ones life \nstyle a vital lie, and now we can understand better why we said it \nwas vital: it is a necessary and basic dishonesty about oneself and \nones whole situation. This revelation is what the Freudian revolu­\ntion in thought really ends up in and is the basic reason that we \nstill strain against Freud. We don’t want to admit that we are funda­\nmentally dishonest about reality, that we do not really control our \nown lives. We don’t want to admit that we do not stand alone, that \nwe always rely on something that transcends us, some system of \nideas and powers in which we are embedded and which support \nus. This power is not always obvious. It need not be overtly a god \nor openly a stronger person, but it can be the power of an all- \n; absorbing activity, a passion, a dedication to a game, a way of life,\nI that like a comfortable web keeps a person buoyed up and ignorant \n\\ of himself, of the fact that he does not rest on his own center. All \nof us are driven to be supported in a self-forgetful way, ignorant \nof what energies we really draw on, of the kind of lie we have \nfashioned in order to live securely and serenely. Augustine was a\n\f\n56 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nmaster analyst of this, as were Kierkegaard, Scheler, and Tillich in \nour day. They saw that man could strut and boast all he wanted, \nbut that he really drew his “courage to be” from a god, a string of \nsexual conquests, a Big Brother, a flag, the proletariat, and the \nfetish of money and the size of a bank balance.\nThe defenses that form a persons character support a grand illu­\nsion, and when we grasp this we can understand the full drivenness \n! of man. He is driven away from himself, from self-knowledge, self- \ni reflection. He is driven toward things that support the lie of his \nI character, his automatic equanimity. But he is also drawn precisely \ntoward those things that make him anxious, as a way of skirting \nthem masterfully, testing himself against them, controlling them by \ndefying them. As Kierkegaard taught us, anxiety lures us on, be­\ncomes the spur to much of our energetic activity: we flirt with our \nown growth, but also dishonestly. This explains much of the friction \nin our lives. We enter symbiotic relationships in order to get the \nsecurity we need, in order to get relief from our anxieties, our alone- \nness and helplessness; but these relationships also bind us, they \nI enslave us even further because they support the lie we have \nfashioned. So we strain against them in order to be more free. The \nirony is that we do this straining uncritically, in a struggle within \nour own armor, as it were; and so we increase our drivenness, the \nsecond-hand quality of our struggle for freedom. Even in our flirta­\ntions with anxiety we are unconscious of our motives,. We seek \nstress, we push our own limits, buf^'doTtwith our screen against \ndespair and not with despair itself. We do it with the^toclc market, \nwith sports cars, with atomic missiles, with the success ladder in \nthe corporation or the competition in the university. We do it in the \nprison of a dialogue with our own little family, by marrying against \ntheir wishes or choosing a way of life because they frown on it, and \nso on. Hence the complicated and second-hand quality of our entire \n5 f drivenness. Even in our passions we are nursery children playing \n! with toys that represent the real world. Even when these toys crash \n} and cost us our lives or our sanity, we are cheated of the consola- \n’ tion that we were in the real world instead of the playpen of our \n\\ fantasies. We still did not meet our doom on our own manly terms, \nin contest with objective reality. It is fateful and ironic how the lie \nwe need in order to live dooms us to a life that is never really ours.\nIt was not until the working out of modem psychoanalysis that\n\f\nHuman Character as a Vital Lie57\nwe could understand something the poets and religious geniuses \nhave long known: that the armor of character was so vital to us that \nto shed it meant to risk death and madness. It is not hard to reason \nj out: If character is a neurotic defense against despair and you shed \ni ! that defense, you admit the full flood of despair, the full realization \nI of the true human condition, what men are really afraid of, what \nj they struggle against, and are driven toward and away from. Freud \nsummed it up beautifully when he somewhere remarked that psy­\nchoanalysis cured the neurotic misery in order to introduce the \npatient to the common misery of life. Neurosis is another word for \ndescribing a complicated technique for avoiding misery, but reality \nis the misery. That is whjjrom earliest times sages have insisted \nthat to see reahfy one *must die and be reborn.^ TheTdea* of'death \nancT rebirth was present in shamanistic times, in Zen thought, in \nStoic thought, in Shakespeare’s King Lear, as well as in Judeo- \nChristian and modem existential thought. But it was not until \nscientific psychology that we could understand what was at stake \nin the death and rebirth: that man’s character was a neurotic \nstructure that went right to the heart of his humanness. As Freder­\nick Peris put it, “To suffer one’s death and to be reborn is not \neasy.” And it is not easy precisely because ..scunueL ■of.-.one ~has.,tP \ndie.\ne the way Peris conceived the neurotic structure as a thick \nedifice built up of four layers. The first two layers are the everyday \nlayers, the tactics that the child learns to get along in society by \nthe facile use of words to win ready approval and to placate others \nand move them along with him: these are the glib, empty talk, \n“cliche,” and role-playing layers. Many people live out their lives \nnever getting underneath them. The third layer is a stiff one to \npenetrate: it is the “impasse” that covers our feeling of being empty \nand lost, the very feeling that we try to banish in building up our \ncharacter defenses. Underneath this layer is the fourth and most \nbaffling one: the “death” or fear-of-death layer; and this, as we have \nseen, is the layer of our true and basic animal anxieties, the terror \nthat we carry around in our secret heart. Only when we explode \nthis fourth layer, says Peris, do we get to the layer of what we might \ncall our “authentic self”: what we reaJJy are without sham, without \ndisguise, without defenses against fear.12\nFrom this sketch of the complex rings of defense that compose\n\f\n58 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nour character, our neurotic shield that protects our pulsating vitality \nt from the dread of truth, we can get some idea of the difficult and \n| excruciatingly painful, all-or-nothing process that psychological re- \n[ birth is. And when it is through psychologically, it only begins \nj humanly: the worst is not the death, but the rebirth itself—theres \nI the rub. What does it mean “to be born again” for man? It means \nfor the first time to be subjected to the terrifying paradox of the \nhuman condition, since one must be bom not as a god, but as a \nman, or as a god-worm, or a god who shits. Only this time without \nthe neurotic shield that hides the full ambiguity of one's life. And \nso we know that every authentic rebirth is a real ejection from \nparadise, as the lives of Tolstoy, Peguy, and others attest. It takes \nmen of granite, men who were automatically powerful, “secure in \ntheir drivenness” we might say, and it makes them tremble, makes \nthem cry—as Peguy stood on the platforms of Parisian busses with \nhot tears rolling down his cheeks while he mumbled prayers.\nIt was Rank who very early admitted that anxiety could not all \nbe overcome therapeutically, and this is what he meant: that it is \nimpossible to stand up to the terror of one's condition without \nanxiety. It was Andras Angyal who got to the heart of the matter \nof psychotherapeutic rebirth when he said that the neurotic who \nhas had therapy is like a member of Alcoholics Anonymous: he can \nnever take his cure for granted, and the best sign of the genuineness \nof that cure is that he lives with humility.13\nFull Humans and Part Humans\nThis discussion brings up a basic contradiction of the whole \ntherapeutic enterprise that has not been aired widely enough; we \nare going to be dwelling on it at the close of this book, but this is \nthe right place to introduce it. It is simply this: what sense does it \nmake to talk about “enjoying ones full humanness”—as Maslow \nurges along with so many others—if “full humanness” means the \nprimary mis-adjustment to the world? If you get rid of the four- \nlayered neurotic shield, the armor that covers the characterological \nlie about life, how can you talk about “enjoying” this Pyrrhic\n\f\nHuman Character as a Vital Lie59\nvictory? The person gives up something restricting and illusory, it \nis true, but only to come face to face with something even more \nawful: genuine despair. Full humanness means full fear and trem­\nbling, at least some of the waking day. When you get a person to \nemerge into life, away from his dependencies, his automatic safety \nin the cloak of someone else's power, what joy can you promise him \nwith the burden of his aloneness? When you get a person to look \nat the sun as it bakes down on the daily carnage taking place on \nearth, the ridiculous accidents, the utter fragility of life, the power­\nlessness of those he thought most powerful—what comfort can you \ngive him from a psychotherapeutic point of view? Luis Bunuel \nlikes to introduce a mad dog into his films as counterpoint to the \nsecure daily routine of repressed living. The meaning of his sym­\nbolism is that no matter what men pretend, they are only one ac­\ncidental bite away from utter fallibility. The artist disguises the \nincongruity that is the pulse-beat of madness but he is aware of it. \nWhat would the average man do with a full consciousness of ab­\nsurdity? He has fashioned his character for the precise purpose of \nputting it between himself and the facts of life; it is his special \ntour-de-force that allows him to ignore incongruities, to nourish \nhimself on impossibilities, to thrive on blindness. He accomplishes \nthereby a peculiarly human victory: the ability to be smug about \nterror. Sartre has called man a “useless passion” because he is so f \nhopelessly bungled, so deluded about his true condition. He wants j \nto be a god with only the equipment of an animal, and so he thrives \\ \non fantasies. As Ortega so well put it in the epigraph we have used \nfor this chapter, man uses his ideas for the defense of his existence, \nto frighten away reality. This is a serious game, the defense of one’s \nexistence^how take it away from people and leave them joyous?\n( Maslow /talks very convincingly about,-“self-ajQtiializationlv,.and \nthe ecstasy of “peak experiences” wherein a person comes to see the \nworld in all its awe and splendor and senses his own free inner \nexpansion and the miracle of his being. Maslow calls this state \n“being cognition,” the openness of perception to the truth of the \nworld, a truth concealed by the neurotic distortions and illusions \nthat protect one against overwhelming experiences. This idea is fine \nand correct, this enjoinder to develop the capacity for “being cogni­\ntion” in order to break out of the one-dimensionality of our lives,"

This was already clearly \nseen by Maslow, when he talked about the “dangers of being-cogni- \ntion.”14 Maslow was too broad-minded and sober to imagine that \nI being-cognition did not have an underside; but he didn’t go far \n| enough toward pointing out what a dangerous underside it was—\n} that it could undermine one’s whole position in the world. It can’t \nbe overstressed, one final time, that to see the world as it really is \nis devastating and terrifying. It achieves the very result that the \nchild has painfully built his character over the years in order to \navoid: it makes routine, automatic, secure, self-confident activity \nimpossible.

A subtle but very profound change has come \nover our understanding of the early development of the child. It is \na change that can be summed up briefly in the shifts from Freudian \nto post-Freudian psychology and now back again to a sobered \nFreudianism.

In this view the parents were thought to be responsible \nfor the child's repressions, for the character defenses that he de­\nveloped, and for the kind of person he turned out to be, as they \nhad provided him with an environment and molded him to it. Even \nmore than that, as the parents had opposed the child's natural \nenergetic and free expansion and had demanded his surrender to \ntheir world, they could be considered in some fundamental way as \nguilty for whatever warpings his character had. If the child had no \ninstincts he at least had plenty of free energy and a natural in­\nnocence of the body. He sought continual activity and diversion, \nwanted to move about his world in its entirety, to bend it to his \nuse and delight as much as possible. He sought to express himself \nspontaneously, feel the most satisfaction in his bodily processes, \nderive the most comfort, thrill, and pleasure from others. But as \ntjiis kind of limitless expansion is not possible in the world, the \nchild has to be checked for his own good; and the parents were the \ncheckers of his activity.

As we saw in Chapter Three, the child’s own \nexistential dilemmas gave him his task quite independently of the \nparents: his \"attitudes\" came to him from his need to adapt to the \nwhole desperate human condition, not merely to attune himself to \nthe whims of his parents.\nThe student of ideas is entitled to wonder what kind of book \nBrown would have fashioned out of his brilliance if he had digested \nAdler and Rank with the thoroughness with which he studied Freud.\nHuman Character as a Vital Lie 61"

    "raw_text": "62 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nIt was Adler and Rank, after all, who understood the desperate \nsituation of the child, without falling either into the Freudian trap \nof inner instincts or that of easy environmentalism. As Rank put it \nonce and for all, for all future psychoanalysts and students of man:\nevery human being is . . . equally unfree, that is, we . . . create out of \n1 freedom, a prison. .. .16\nRank was criticizing Rousseaus vision of man as born free and then \nput into chains by training and by society. Rank understood that in\n(\nthe face of the overwhelmingness of the world the child could notij \nout of himself muster the stamina and the authority necessary to \nlive in full expansiveness with limitless horizons of perception an \nexperience.\nWe have arrived at a unique stage in the development of psy­\nchoanalytic thought. By fully incorporating the work of Adler and \nRank on an equal level with Freud, modem psychoanalysis has been \nable to keep the roundness and soberness of the master without the \nerrors, extreme formulations, and dogma of strict Freudianism. As I \nsee it, Browns book represents a declaration that the circle has \nbeen closed fully between the psychoanalysis of the founders and \nthe most recent theoretical and clinical work, without anything es­\nsential being lost. Even on the syndrome that in truth could most \njustifiably accuse the parents of failing to fashion an adequate \nhuman being—that of schizophrenia—there has been a marked \nchange of emphasis, a new consciousness of the tragic dimensions \nof human life. No one has summed this up better than Harold \nSearles, and I would like to quote at length his sensitive and au­\nthoritative personal statement, which I think is a very important \none historically:\nAt Chestnut Lodge, the twice-weekly, hour-long case presentations \nusually have to do with schizophrenic patients. . . . When the author \nwent there, nearly 12 years ago, the therapists—including the author— \npresenting these cases often tended to paint a totally, or almost totally, \nblack picture of the patient's childhood family relationships; the feeling- \natmosphere of the presentation was one of blame of the parents more \nthan anything else. As the years have gone on, the author has found that \nthe presentations have come to convey less and less of such blame, and\n\f\nHuman Character as a Vital Lie63\nto convey more and more of the tragedy of the patients' lives—tragedy \nwhich is so much of a piece with the tragedy of life for all of us that the \npresentation is often a profoundly grief-laden experience foT both the \npresenter and the listeners. One feels that the staff-presentation now gives \na truer picture of a patient's life, but a picture which is much more \ndeeply shaking than was the blame-colored picture previously often \nseen.17\nThe tragedy of life that Searles is referring to is the one we have \nbeen discussing: mans finitude, his dread of death and of the over­\nwhelmingness of life. The schizophrenic feels these more than any­\none else because he has not been able to build the confident \ndefenses that a person normally uses to deny them. The schizo­\nphrenic's misfortune is that he has been burdened with extra \nanxieties, extra guilt, extra helplessness, an even more unpredictable \nand unsupportive environment. He is not surely seated in his body, \nhas no secure base from which to negotiate a defiance of and a \ndenial of the real nature of the world. The parents have made him \nmassively inept as an organism. He has to contrive extra-ingenious \nand extra-desperate ways of living in the world that will keep him \nfrom being tom apart by experience, since he is already almost \napart. We see again confirmed the point of view that a persons \ncharacter is a defense against despair, an attempt to avoid insanity \nbecause of the real nature of the world. Searles looks at schizo­\nphrenia precisely as the result of the inability to shut out terror, as \na desperate style of living with terror. Frankly I don’t know any­\nthing more cogent that needs to be said about this syndrome: it is a \nfailure in humanization, which means a failure to confidently deny \nmans real situation on this planet. Schizophrenia is the limiting test \ncase for the theory of character and reality that we have been ex­\npounding here: the failure to build dependable character defenses \nallows the true nature of reality to appear to man. It is scientifically \napodictic. The creativity of people on the schizophrenic end of the \nhuman continuum is a creativity that springs from the inability to \naccept the standardized cultural denials of the real nature of ex­\nperience. And the price of this kind of almost “extra human” crea­\ntivity is to live on the brink of madness, as men have long known. \nThe schizophrenic is supremely creative in an almost extra-human \nsense because he is furthest from the animal: he lacks the secure\n\f\n64 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ninstinctive programming of lower organisms; and he lacks the secure \ncultural programming of average men. No wonder he appears to \naverage men as “crazy'': he is not in anything’s world.f\nConclusion\nLet us close our long discussion of the function of character by \njuxtaposing two great pieces of poetic writing and insight, separated \nby almost three centuries. The first, by Thomas Traherne, gives a \nbeautiful description of the world as it appears to the perceptions \nof the child before he has been able to fashion automatic reactions. \nTraherne describes the pristine perceptions of the child:\nAll appeared new, and strange at first, inexpressibly rare and delightful \nand beautiful. . . . The com was orient and immortal wheat, which never \nshould be reaped, nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from ever­\nlasting to everlasting. The dust and stones of the street were as precious \nas gold; the gates were at first the end of the world. The green trees \nwhen I saw them first through one of the gates transported and ravished \nme, their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap, and al­\nmost mad with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderful things. \nThe Men! O what venerable and reverend creatures did the aged seem! \nImmortal Cherubims! And young men glittering and sparkling Angels, \nand maids strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty! Boys and girls \ntumbling in the street, and playing, were moving jewels. I knew not that \nthey were born or should die. . . . The city seemed to stand in Eden. . . .\nWe might call this the paradise of prerepression. But then, Traherne \ngoes on to describe his fall from Eden; the development of cultural \nperceptions and denials of the pristine character of reality; and like \na modem psychoanalyst in the early days of, say, Chestnut Lodge, \nhe accuses the parents of this fall, makes his whole case against \nthem:\nThoughts are the most present things to thoughts, and of the most power­\nful influence. My soul was only apt and disposed to great things; but \nsouls to souls are like apples to apples, one being rotten rots another. \nWhen I began to speak and go, nothing began to be present to me, but\nf For a fuller summing-up of the problem of schizophrenic failure see Chap­\nter Ten.\n\f\nHuman Character as a Vital Lie65\nwhat was present to me in their thoughts. Nor was anything present to \nme any other way, than it was so to them. ... All tilings were absent \nwhich they talked not of. So I began among my play-fellows to prize a \ndrum, a fine coat, a penny, a gilded book, & c.,. ... As for the Heavens \nand the Sun and Stars they disappeared, and were no more unto me \nthan the bare walls. So that the strange riches of man s invention quite \novercame the riches of Nature, being learned more laboriously and in \nthe second place.18\nWhat is missing in this splendid portrayal of the child's fall from \nnatural perception into the artificialities of the cultural world? \nNothing less than what we have cited as the great post-Freudian \nmerger on the human personality: Trahernes own complicity in the \nprocess, his need to fall from grace in order to grow, move about \nwithout anxiety, protect himself against the Sun, the Stars, the \nHeavens. Traherne doesn't record his other pristine reactions, say, \nto the piercing screams of his “play-fellows” as they cut their hands \nor smashed their noses and mouths and splashed him with globs of \nweird, warm red that sent terror into his bowels. He says that he \nknew not that they should die, that all seemed immortal—but did \nhis parents introduce death into the world? This was the deep-lying \nrot that rubbed into his soul, and it rubbed in not from the parents \nbut from the world, from the “riches of nature.” In some complex \nways death edged itself as a symbol into his perceptions and chilled \nhis soul, and to banish the facts of life Traherne had to remold his \nparadise, even to lying about it in his memory as we all do. True, \nthe earth was the place of mystical beauty that he painted it and \nthat Carlyle later agreed to be “a mystic temple”; but it was at the \nsame time “a hall of doom” that Traherne chose to deny in his \nmemory of childhood.\nThe totality of the human condition is the thing that is so hard \nfor man to recapture. He wants his world safe for delight, wants to \nblame others for his fate. Compare to Traherne a modem poet's \nconsciousness of the full roundness of the human condition. Marcia \nLee Anderson tells us with penetrating brilliance how we have to \nlive in a hall of doom, what we need to do to protect ourselves:\nWe multiply diseases for delight,\nInvent a horrid want, a shameful doubt,\nLuxuriate in license, feed on night,\n\f\n66 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nMake inward bedlam—and will not come out.\nWhy should we? Stripped of subtle complications,\nWho could regard the sun except with fear?\nThis is our shelter against contemplation,\nOur only refuge from the plain and clear.\nWho would crawl out from under the obscure \nTo stand defenseless in the sunny air?\nNo terror of obliquity so sure \nAs the most shining terror of despair \nTo know how simple is our deepest need,\nHow sharp, and how impossible to feed.19\nThe irony of mans condition is that the deepest need is to be free \nof the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which \nawakens it, and so we must shrink from being fully alive. Marcia \nLee Anderson draws the circle not only on Traherne, but on \nMaslow, on humanistic psychoanalysis, and even on Freudian Nor­\nman O. Brown himself. What exactly would it mean on this earth to \nbe wholly unrepressed, to live in full bodily and psychic expansive­\nness? It can only mean to be reborn into madness. Brown warns us \nof the full radicalness of his reading of Freud by stressing that he \nresolutely follows Ferenczi’s insight that “Character-traits are, so to \nspeak, secret psychoses/’20 This is shaking scientific truth, and we \nhave also subscribed to it with Brown. If it has seemed hard for \nmen to get agreement on such a truth during the age of Freud, one \nday it will be secure.\nBut the chilling reality behind this truth is even more upsetting, \nand there doesn’t seem to be much that we can do with it or will \never be able to do with it: I mean that without character-traits there \nhas to be full and open psychosis. At the very end of this book I \nwant to sum up the basic contradictions of Brown’s argument for \nnew men without character defenses, his hope for a rebirth of man­\nkind into a “second innocence.” For now, it is enough to invoke \nMarcia Lee Anderson’s complete scientific formula: “Stripped of \nsubtle complications [i.e., of all the character defenses—repression, \ndenial, misperception of reality], who could regard the sun except \nwith fear?”"

The noted psychologist Mowrer \nsummed it up perfectly two decades ago: “Freud had to live and \nwrite before the earlier work of Kierkegaard could be correctly \nunderstood and appreciated.”2 There have been several good at­\ntempts to show how Kierkegaard anticipated the data of modem \nclinical psychology. Most of the European existentialists have had \nsomething to say about this, along with theologians like Paul \nTillich.3 The meaning of this work is that it draws a circle around \npsychiatry and religion; it shows that the best existential analysis of \nthe human condition leads directly into the problems of God and \nfaith, which is exactly what Kierkegaard had argued.\nI am not going to attempt to repeat and decode Kierkegaard’s \nbreathtakingly penetrating and often difficult-to-understand analysis \nof the human condition. What I want to do instead is to try to \npresent a summing-up of the main argument contained in his psy­\nchological works, as pointedly and sparingly as possible, so that the \nreader can see “in a nutshell” what Kierkegaard was driving at. If \nI can do this without getting too involved because fascinated by \nKierkegaards genius, the reader should be struck by the result. The \nstructure of Kierkegaard’s understanding of man is almost exactly a \nrecap of the modern clinical picture of man that we have sketched \nin the first four chapters of this book. The reader can then judge for \nhimself how congruent the two pictures are at basic points (even \nthough I don’t present Kierkegaard in his stunning detail), why it \nis that we are today comparing Kierkegaard’s stature in psychology \nto Freud’s, and why I and others are prepared to call Kierkegaard \nas great a student of the human condition as was Freud. The fact \nis that, although writing in the 1840’s he was really post-Freudian, \nwhich conveys the eternal uncanniness of genius.\nThe Existential Paradox as the Beginning of \nPsychology and Religion\nThe foundation stone for Kierkegaard’s view of man is the myth \nof the Fall, the ejection of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. \nIn this myth is contained, as we saw, the basic insight of psy­\nchology for all time: that man is a union of opposites, of self­\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 69\nconsciousness and of physical body. Man emerged from the instinc­\ntive thoughtless action of the lower animals and came to reflect on \nhis condition. He was given a consciousness of his individuality \nand his part-divinity in creation, the beauty and uniqueness of his \nface and his name. At the same time he was given the consciousness \nof the terror of the world and of his own death and decay. This \nparadox is the really constant thing about man in all periods of his­\ntory and society; it is thus the true “essence” of man, as Fromm \nsaid. As we saw, the leading modern psychologists have themselves \nmade it the cornerstone of their understanding. But Kierkegaard \nhad already counseled them: “Further than this psychology cannot \ngo . . . and moreover it can verify this point again and again in its \nobservation of human life.”4 \nThe fall into self-consciousness, the emergence from comfortable \nignorance in nature, had one great penalty for man: it gave him \ndread, or anxiety. One does not find dread in the beast, says \nKierkegaard, “precisely for the reason that by nature the beast is \nnot qualified by spirit.”5 For “spirit” read “self” or symbolic inner \nidentity. The beast has none. It is ignorant, says Kierkegaard, there­\nfore innocent; but man is a “synthesis of the soulish and bodily”6 \nand so experiences anxiety. Again, for “soulish” we must read “self- \nconscious.”\nIf a man were a beast or an angel, he would not be able to be in dread. \n[That is, if he were utterly unself-conscious or totally un-animal.] Since \nhe is a synthesis he can be in dread . . . man himself produces dread.7\nMans anxiety is a function of his sheer ambiguity and of his com­\nplete powerlessness to overcome that ambiguity, to be straightfor­\nwardly an animal or an angel. He cannot live heedless of his fate, \nnor can he take sure control over that fate and triumph over it by \nbeing outside the human condition:\nThe spirit cannot do away with itself [i.e., self-consciousness cannot dis­\nappear]. . . . Neither can man sink down into the vegetative life [i.e., be \nwholly an animal].... He cannot flee from dread.8\nBut the real focus of dread is not the ambiguity itself, it is the result \nof the judgment on man: that if Adam eats of the fruit of the tree \nof knowledge God tells him “Thou shalt surely die.” In other words,\n\f\n70 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nthe final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own \ndeath, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal \nkingdom. This is the meaning of the Garden of Eden myth and the \nrediscovery of modem psychology: that death is man s peculiar and \ngreatest anxiety.0\nKierkegaards Characterology\nKierkegaards whole understanding of man’s character is that it \nis a structure built up to avoid perception of the “terror, perdition \n[and] annihilation [that] dwell next door to every man.”9 He under­\nstood psychology the way a contemporary psychoanalyst does: that \nits task is to discover the strategies that a person uses to avoid \nanxiety. What style does he use to function automatically and un­\ncritically in the world, and how does this style cripple his true \ngrowth and freedom of action and choice? Or, in words that are \nalmost Kierkegaards: how is a person being enslaved by his char- \nacterological lie about himself?\nKierkegaard described these styles with a brilliance that today \nseems uncanny and with a vocabulary that sums up much of the \npsychoanalytic theory of character defenses. Whereas today we talk \nabout the “mechanisms of defense” such as repression and denial, \nKierkegaard talked about the same things with different terms: he \nreferred to the fact that most men live in a “half-obscurity” about \ntheir own condition,10 they are in a state of “shut-upness” wherein \nthey block off their own perceptions of reality.11 He understood the \ncompulsive character, the rigidity of the person who has had to \nbuild extra-thick defenses against anxiety, a heavy character armor, \nand he described him in the following terms:\n* Two of the most brilliant uses and analyses of the idea of the duality and \nambiguity of man in modem Christian thought are by Reinhold Niebuhr, The \nNature and Destiny of Man, Volume One (New York: Scribners Sons, 1941), \nand Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, Volume Three (Chicago: University of \nChicago Press, 1963), Chapter 1. These studies prove beyond a doubt the \ntruth of Kierkegaards work, that psychological and religious analyses of the \nhuman condition are inextricable, if they get down to basics.\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 71\nA partisan of the most rigid orthodoxy . . . knows it all, he bows before \nthe holy, truth is for him an ensemble of ceremonies, he talks about pre­\nsenting himself before the throne of God, of how many times one must \nbow, he knows everything the same way as does the pupil who is able to \ndemonstrate a mathematical proposition with the letters ABC, but not \nwhen they are changed to DEF. He is therefore in dread whenever he \nhears something not arranged in the same order.12\nThere is no doubt that by “shut-upness” Kierkegaard means what \nwe today refer to by repression; it is the closed personality, the one \nwho has fenced himself around in childhood, not tested his own \npowers in action, not been free to discover himself and his world \nin a relaxed way. If the child is not burdened by too much parental \nblocking of his action, too much infection with the parents’ anxieties, \nhff can develop his defenses in a less monopolizing way, can remain \nspmewhat fluid and open in character. He is prepared to test reality \nmore in terms of his own action and experimentation and less on \nthe basis of delegated authorityju^xejjidgnent or preperception. \nKierkegaard understood this difference by making a distinction be- \ntween lofty’ shut-upness and mistaken” shut-upness. He went on \nto give a Rousseau-like enjoinder for raising children with the right \nkind of character orientation:\nIt is of infinite importance that a child be brought up with a conception \nof the lofty shut-upness [reserve], and be saved from the mistaken kind. \nIn an external respect it is easy to perceive when the moment has ar­\nrived that one ought to let the child walk alone; . . . the art is to be \nconstantly present and yet not be present, to let the child be allowed to \ndevelop itself, while nevertheless one has constantly a survey clearly \nbefore one. The art is to leave the child to itself in the very highest \nmeasure and on the greatest possible scale, and to express this apparent \nabandonment in such a way that, unobserved, one at the same time \nknows everything. . . . And the father who educates or does everything \nfor the child entrusted to him, but has not prevented him from becoming \n^hut-up, has incurred a great accountability.13\nJust as Rousseau and Dewey, Kierkegaard is warning the parent to \nlet the child do his own exploration of the world and develop his \nown sure experimental powers. He knows that the child has to be\n\f\n72 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nprotected against dangers and that watchfulness by the parent is of \nvital importance, but he doesn’t want the parent to obtrude his own \nanxieties into the picture, to cut off the child’s action before it is \nabsolutely necessary. Today we know that such an upbringing alone \ngives the child a self-confidence in the face of experience that he \nwould not have if he were overly blocked: it gives him an “inner \nsustainment.” And it is precisely this inner sustainment that allows \nthe child to develop a “lofty” shut-upness, or reserve: that is, an \nego-controlled and self-confident appraisal of the world by a per­\nsonality. that can open up,more easily to experience. t!fffsta¥en” \nsfiSLupness, on the other hand, is the result of too much tlocEage; \ntoo much anxiety, too much effort to face up to experience by an \norganism that has been overburdened and weakened in its own \ncontrols: it means, therefore, more automatic repression by an es­\nsentially closed personality. And so, for Kierkegaard, the “good” is \nthe opening toward new possibility and choice, the ability to face \ninto anxiety; the closed is the evil, that which turns one away from \nnewness and broader perceptions and experiences; the closed shuts \nout revelation, obtrudes a veil between the person and his own \nsituation in the world.14 Ideally these should be transparent, but for \nthe closed person they are opaque.\nIt is easy to see that shut-upness is precisely what we have called \n“the lie of character,” and Kierkegaard calls it the same thing:\nIt is easy to see that shut-upness eo ipso signifies a lie, or, if you prefer, \nuntruth. But untruth is precisely unfreedom . . . the elasticity of freedom \nis consumed in the service of close reserve. . . . Close reserve was the \neffect of the negating retrenchment of the ego in the individuality.15\nThis is a perfectly contemporary psychoanalytic description of the \ncosts of repression on the total personality. I am omitting Kierke­\ngaard’s more detailed and penetrating analysis of how the person \nbecomes fragmented within himself by the repression, how the real \nperception of reality dwells under the surface, close at hand, ready \nto break through the repression, how the repression leaves the per­\nsonality seemingly intact, seemingly functioning as a whole, in \ncontinuity—but how that continuity is broken, how the personality \nis really at the mercy of the discontinuity expressed by the repres-\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 73\nlion.1 6 To a modem, clinically-trained mind such an analysis must \nbe truly marvelous.\nKierkegaard understood that the lie of character is built up be- \nOtuse the child needs to adjust to the world, to the parents, and \nto his own existential dilemmas. It is built up before the child has \nA chance to learn about himself in an open or free way, and thus \ncharacter defenses are automatic and unconscious. The problem is \nthat the child becomes dependent on them and comes to be encased \nin his own character armor, unable to see freely beyond his own \nprison or into himself, into the defenses he is using, the things that \nare determining his unfreedom.17 The best that the child can hope \nis that his shut-upness will not be of the “mistaken” or massive kind, \nin which his character is too fearful of the world to be able to open \nitself to the possibilities of experience. But that depends largely \non the parents, on accidents of the environment, as Kierkegaard \nknew. Most people have parents who have “incurred a great ac­\ncountability,n and so they are obliged to shut themselves off from \npossibility.\nKierkegaard gives us some portrait sketches of the styles of deny­\ning possibility, or the lies of character—which is the same thing. \nHe is intent on describing what we today call “inauthentic” men, \nmen who avoid developing their own uniqueness; they follow out \nthe styles of automatic and uncritical living in which they were \nconditioned as children. They are “inauthentic” in that they do not \nbelong to themselves, are not “their own” person, do not act from \ntheir own center, do not see reality on its terms; they are the one­\ndimensional men totally immersed in the fictional games being \nplayed in their society, unable to transcend their social condition­\ning: the corporation men in the West, the bureaucrats in the East, \nthe tribal men locked up in tradition—man everywhere who doesn't \nunderstand what it means to think for himself and who, if he did, \nwould shrink back at the idea of such audacity and exposure. \nKierkegaard gives us a description of\nthe immediate man . . .  his self or he himself is a something included \nalong with “the other” in the compass of the temporal and the worldly. \n. . . Thus the self coheres immediately with “the other,” wishing, desir­\ning, enjoying, etc., but passively; ... he manages to imitate the other\n\f\n74 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nmen, noting how they manage to live, and so he too lives after a sort. In \nChristendom he too is a Christian, goes to church every Sunday, hears \nand understands the parson, yea, they understand one another; he dies; \nthe parson introduces him into eternity for the price of $10—but a self \n| he was not, and a self he did not become. . . . For the immediate man\nI does not recognize his self, he recognizes himself only by his dress, . . . \n| he recognizes that he has a self only by externals.18\nThis is a perfect description of the “automatic cultural man”—man \nas confined by culture, a slave to it, who imagines that hejhas an \nidentity if he pays his insurance premium, that he has control of \nhis life if he guns his sports car or works his electric toothbrush. \nToday the inauthentic or immediate men are familiar types, after \ndecades of Marxist and existentialist analysis of mans slavery to \nhis social system. But in Kierkegaards time it must have been a \nshock to be a modern European city-dweller and be considered a \nPhilistine at the same time. For Kierkegaard “philistinism” was \ntriviality, man lulled by the daily routines of his society, content \nwith the satisfactions that it offers him: in today’s world the car, \nthe shopping center, the two-week summer vacation. Man is pro­\ntected by the secure and limited alternatives his society offers him, \nand if he does not look up from his path he can live out his life with \na certain dull security:\nDevoid of imagination, as the Philistine always is, he lives in a certain \ntrivial province of experience as to how things go, what is possible, what \nusually occurs. . . . Philistinism tranquilizes itself in the trivial. . . .19\nWhy does man accept to live a trivial life? Because of the danger \nof a full horizon of experience, of course. This is the deeper motiva­\ntion of philistinism, that it celebrates the triumph over possibility, \nover freedom. Philistinism knows its real enemy: freedom is dan­\ngerous. If you follow it too willingly it threatens to pull you into \nthe air; if you give it up too wholly, you become a prisoner of \nnecessity. The safest thing is to toe the mark of what is socially \npossible. I think this is the meaning of Kierkegaard’s observation:\nFor philistinism thinks it is in control of possibility, it thinks that when \nit has decoyed this prodigious elasticity into the field of probability or"

Kierkegaard talks \nabout decoying the prodigious elasticity of freedom “into the mad­\nhouse” where it is held prisoner. What does he mean by such a \ncondensed image? To me he means that one of the great dangers \nof life is too much possibility, and that the place where we find \npeople who have succumbed to this danger is the madhouse. Here \nKierkegaard shows that he was a master theorist not only of “normal \ncultural pathology” but also of abnormal pathology or psychosis. He \nunderstands that psychosis is neurosis pushed to its extreme. At \nleast this is how I read many of his observations in the section of \nhis book called “Despair Viewed Under the Aspects of Finitude/ \nInfinitude.”21 Let us pause on this, because if my reading is correct \nit will help us understand further how the most extreme forms of \nmental derangement are clumsy attempts to come to grips with the \nbasic problem of life.\nKierkegaard is painting for us a broad and incredibly rich portrait \nof types of human failure, ways in which man succumbs to and is \nbeaten by life and the world; beaten because he fails to face up to \nthe existential truth of his situation—the truth that he is an inner \nsymbolic self, which signifies a certain freedom, and that he is \nbound by a finite body, which limits that freedom. The attempt to \nignore either aspect of mans situation, to repress possibility or to \ndeny necessity, means that man will live a lie, fail to realize his true \nnature, be “the most pitiful of all things.” But man is not always so \nlucky, he cannot always get by with just being pitiful. If the lie \nthat he attempts to live is too flaunting of reality, a man can lose \neverything during his lifetime—and this is precisely what we mean \nby psychosis: the complete and utter breakdown of the character \nstructure.

    "raw_text": "76 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nof too much and too little possibility. Too much possibility is the \nattempt by the person to overvalue the powers of the symbolic self \nIt reflects the attempt to exaggerate one half of the human dualism \nat the expense of the other. In this sense, what we call schizo­\nphrenia is an attempt by the symbolic self to deny the limitations \nof the finite body; in doing so, the entire person is pulled off \nbalance and destroyed. It is as though the freedom of creativity \nthat stems from within the symbolic self cannot be contained by \nthe body, and the person is torn apart. This is how we understand \nschizophrenia today, as the split of self and body, a split in which \nthe self is unanchored, unlimited, not bound enough to everyday \nthings, not contained enough in dependable physical behavior.22 \nAnd this is how Kierkegaard understands the problem:\nFor the self is a synthesis in which the finite is the limiting factor, and \nthe infinite is the expanding factor. Infinitude’s despair is therefore the \nfantastical, the limitless.23!\nBy “infinitude’s despair” Kierkegaard means the sickness of the per­\nsonality, the opposite of health. And so the person becomes sick by \nplunging into the limitless, the symbolic self becomes “fantastic” \n—as it does in schizophrenia—when it splits away from the body, \nfrom a dependable grounding in real experience in the everyday \nworld. The full-blown schizophrenic is abstract, ethereal, unreal; he \nbillows out of the earthly categories of space and time, floats out \nof his body, dwells in an eternal now, is not subject to d?ath and \ndestruction. He has vanquished these in his fantasy, or perhaps \nbetter, in the actual fact that he has quit his body, renourced its \nlimitations. Kierkegaards description is not only eloquent, i* is also \nprecisely clinical:\nGenerally the fantastical is that which so carries a man out into the in­\nfinite that it merely carries him away from himself and therewith pre-\nf Kierkegaard’s use of \"self” may be a bit confusing. He uses it to include \nthe symbolic self and the physical body. It is a synonym really for “total \npersonality” that goes beyond the person to include what we would now call \nthe \"soul” or the \"ground of being” out of which the created person sprang. \nBut this is not important for us here, except to introduce the idea that the \ntotal person is a dualism of finitude and infinitude.\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 77\nVillts him from returning to himself. So when feeling becomes fantastic, \nthe self is simply volatilized more and more. . . . The self thus leads a \nfantastic existence in abstract endeavor after infinity, or in abstract isola­\ntion, constantly lacking itself, from which it merely gets further and \nlUrther away.\nThis is pure Ronald Laings The Divided Self, over a century ago. \nAgain:\nNow if possibility outruns necessity, the self runs away from itself, so \nIGF it has no necessity whereto it is bound to return—then this is the \n>air [sfel<n^sT\"6r ^ siBintyrTH^ s^Tecomes an abstract possibility \nwhich tne^l^cT'^BrS^n^s^? out'^wlth\"loun3ering in the possible, but \ndoes not budgelromjEl§BfiLJ3^t get to any spot, for precisely the \nnecessary is the spot: to become oneself is. jreciselv a movement at the \n■got.2 4\nWhat Kierkegaard means here is that the development of the \nperson is a development in depth from a fixed center in the per­\nsonality, a center that unites both aspects of the existential dualism \n—the self and the body. But this kind of development needs pre­\ncisely an acknowledgment of reality, the reality of ones limits:\nWhat the self now lacks is surely reality—so one would commonly say, \nas one says of a man that he has become unreal. But upon closer inspec­\ntion it is really necessity that man lacks. ... What really is lacking is \nthe power to . . . submit to the necessary in oneself, to what may be \ncalled one s limit. Therefore the misfortune does not consist in the fact \nthat such a self did not amount to anything in the world; no, the mis­\nfortune is that the man did not become aware of himself, aware that the \nself he is, is a perfectly definite something, and so is the necessary. On \nthe contrary, he lost himself, owing to the fact that this self was seen \nfantastically reflected in the possible.25\nOf course, this description touches everyday man as well at the \nextreme of schizophrenia, and it is just the cogency of Kierkegaard’s \nanalysis that the two can be placed on the same continuum:\nInstead of summoning back possibility into necessity, the man pursues the \npossibility—and at last cannot find his way back to himself.26\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\nThe same generality holds true with the following, which could \ndescribe the average man who lives in a simple world of billowing \ninner energy and fantasy, like Walter Mitty or what we today call \n“ambulatory schizophrenics”—those whose self and body are in a \nvery tenuous relationship but manage nevertheless to carry on with­\nout being submerged by inner energies and emotions, by fantastic \nimages, sounds, fears, and hopes they cannot contain:\nv But in spite of the fact that a man has become fantastic in this fashion, \nhe may nevertheless . . .  be perfectly well able to live on, to be a man, \nas it seems, to occupy himself with temporal things, get married, beget \nchildren, win honor and esteem—and perhaps no one notices that in a \ndeeper sense frg^acks a self.27\nThat is, he lacks a securely unified self and body, centered on his \nown controlling ego energies, and facing realistically up to his situa­\ntion and to the nature of his limits and possibilities in the world. \nBut this, as we shall see, is Kierkegaards idea of consummate health, \nnot easy to attain.\nIf schizophrenic psychosis is on a continuum of a kind of normal \ninflation of inner fantasy, of symbolic possibility, then something \nsimilar should be true of depressive psychosis. And so it is in the \nportrait that Kierkegaard paints. Depressive psychosis is the extreme \n\\ on the continuum of too much necessity, that is, too muchfinitude,\nI too much limitation by the body and the behaviors of the person in \ni the real world, and not enough freedom of the inner self, of inner \n| sjnmbolic possibility. This is how we understand depressive psy- \nI chosis today: as a bogging down in the demands of others—family,\nI job, the narrow horizon of daily duties. In such a bogging down the \nindividual does not feel or jee jhat jhe has alternatives, cannot, \nj imagine any choices or alternate ways of life, cannot release himself \nj from the network of obligations even though these obligations no \nI longer give him a sense of self-esteem, of primary value, of being \nj a heroic contributor to world life even by doing his daily family and \njob duties. As I once speculated,28 the schizophrenic is not enough \nbuilt into his world—what Kierkegaard has called the sickness of \ninfinitude; the depressive, on the other hand, is built into his world \n^  too solidly, too overwhelmingly. Kierkegaard put it this way:\n\f\n/\nBut while one sort of despair plunges wildly into the infinite and loses \nitself, a second sort permits itself as it were to be defrauded by “the \nOthers.” By seeing the multitude of men about it, by getting engaged in \nall orts of wordly affairs, by becoming wise about how things go in this \nworld, such a man forgets himself . . . does not dare to believe in him­\nself, finds it too venturesome a thing to be himself, far easier and safer \nto be like the others, to become an imitation, a number, a cipher in the\nis is a superb characterization of the “culturally normal” man, \nthe one who dares not stand up for his own meanings because this \nmeans too much danger, too much exposure. Better not to be one­\nself, better to live tucked into others, embedded in a safe frame­\nwork of social and cultural obligations and duties.\nAgain, too, this kind of characterization must be understood as \nbeing on a continuum, at the extreme end of which we find depres­\nsive psychosis. The depressed person is so afraid of being himself, \nso fearful of exerting his own individuality, of insisting on what \nmight be his own meanings, his own conditions for living, that he \nseems literally stupid. He cannot seem to understand the situation \nhe is in, cannot see beyond his own fears, cannot grasp why he has \nbogged down. Kierkegaard phrases it beautifully:\nwill compare the tendency to run wild in possibility with the \nof a child to enunciate words, the lack of possibility is like being \n... for without possibility a man cannot, as it were, draw breath.30\nThis is precisely the condition of depression, that one can hardly \nbreathe or move. One of the unconscious tactics that the depressed \nperson resorts to, to try to make sense out of his situation, is to see \nhimself as immensely worthless and guilty. This is a marvelous \n“invention” really, because it allows him to move out of his condi­\ntion of dumbness, and make some kind of conceptualization of his \nsituation, some kind of sense out of it—even if he has to take full \nblame as the culprit who is causing so much needless misery to \nothers. Could Kierkegaard have been referring to just such an \nimaginative tactic when he casually observed;\nSometimes the inventiveness of the human imagination suffices to procure \npossibility. . . .31\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 79\nJlf one\nJefforts\njdumb"

They are fortunate enough to be able to stay \non the middle ground of “philistinism.” Breakdown occurs either \nbecause of too much possibility or too little; philistinism, as we \nobserved earlier, knows its real enemy and tries to play it safe with \nfreedom. Here is how Kierkegaard sums up the three alternatives \navailable to men; the first two correspond to the psychotic syn­\ndromes of schizophrenia and depression:\nFor with the audacity of despair that man soared aloft who ran wild in \npossibility; but crushed down by despair that man strains himself against \nexistence to whom everything has become necessary. But philistinism \nspiritlessly celebrates its triumph . . . imagines itself to be the master, \ndoes not take note that precisely thereby it has taken itself captive to be \nthe slave of spiritlessness and to be the most pitiful of all things.33\nIn other words, philistinism is what we would call “normalnetH \nrosis.” Most men figure out how to live safely within the prob- \nabilities of a given set of social rules. The Philistine trusts that by \nkeeping himself at a low level of personal intensity he can avoid \nbeing pulled off balance by experience; philistinism works, as \nKierkegaard said, by “tranquilizing itself with the trivial.” His \nanalysis was written almost a century before Freud spoke of the \npossibility of “social neuroses,” the “pathology of whole cultural / \ncommunities.”34 ^ y/\n1 1  am going to be talking about these things in Chapter Ten, but I am \nlingering on them here in order to show how organic a part of Kierkegaard’s \nown understanding they are and how they can be phrased in his own concepts \nand language.\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\nOther Urges to Freedom\nKierkegaard's threefold typology does not exhaust the character \nof man. He knows that all men are not so “immediate” or shallow, \nso automatically built into their culture, so securely embedded in \nthings and in others, so trustingly a reflex of their world. Also, com­\nparatively few people end up on the psychotic extremes of the \ncontinuum of human defeat; some win a degree of self-realization \nwithout surrender to complete spiritlessness or slavery. And here \nKierkegaards analysis becomes the most telling: he is attempting \nto ferret people out of the lie of their lives whose lives do not look \nlike a lie, who seem to succeed in being true, complete and au­\nthentic persons.\nThere is the type of man who has great contempt for “im­\nmediacy,” who tries to cultivate his inferiority, base his pride on \nsomething deeper and inner, create a distance between himself and \nthe average man. Kierkegaard calls this type of man the “introvert.” \nHe is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, \nwith individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and with­\ndraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret \nself, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, isjbhe only \nreal problem of life, the only worthwhile preoccupation of .man: \nv What is ones true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In \n| what way is one truly unique, and how can he express tKis unique- \n) ness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How \ncan the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that \nhe feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings and use \nthem to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and man­\nkind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In adolescence, most of \nus throb with this dilemma, expressing it either with words and \n1 thoughts or with simple numb pain and longing. But usually life \n<  suck us up into standardized activities. The social hero-system into \nwhich we are born marks out paths for our heroism, paths to which \nI we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please \nI others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working \nour inner secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we \nbecome purely external men, playing successfully the standardized"

Kierkegaard describes him:\n. . . outwardly he is completely \"a real man.” He is a university man, \nhusband and father, an uncommonly competent civil functionary ^ven, a \nrespectable father, very gentle to his wife and carefulness itself with \nrespect to his children. And a Christian? Well, yes, he is that too after \na sort; however, he preferably avoids talking on the subject. ... He very \nseldom goes to church, because it seems to him that most parsons really \ndon t know what they are talking about. He makes an exception in the \ncase of one particular priest of whom he concedes that he knows what he \nis talking about, but he doesn’t want to hear him for another reason, be­\ncause he has a fear that this might lead him too far.35\n“Too far” because he does not really want to push the problem of \nhis uniqueness to any total confrontation:\nThat which as a husband makes him so gentle and as a father so careful \nis, apart from his good-nature and his sense of duty, the admission he \nhas made to himself in his most inward reserve concerning his weak­\nness.36\nAnd so he lives in a kind of “incognito,” content to toy—in his \nperiodic solitudes—with the idea of who he might really be; content \nto insist on a “little difference,” to pride himself on a vaguely-felt"

    "raw_text": "84 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nBut this is not an easy position to maintain with equanimity. It \nis rare, says Kierkegaard, to continue on in it. Once you pose the \nproblem of what it means to be a person, even dumbly, weakly, or \nwith a veneer of pride about your imagined difference from others, \nyou may be in trouble. Introversion is impotence, but an impotence \nalready self-conscious to a degree, and it can become troublesome. \nIt may lead to a chafing at ones dependency on his family and his \njob, an ulcerous gnawing as a reaction to ones embeddedness, a \nfeeling of slavery in ones safety. For a strong person it may become \nintolerable, and he may try tojbrealc out of it, sometiinesIEyllSicide, \nsometimes by drowning himself desperately in the world and in the \nrushnf experience. \"\n[ And this brings us to our final type of man: the one who asserts \nhimself out of defiance of his own weakness, who tries to be a god \nunto himself, the master of his fate, a self-created man. He will not \nbe merely the pawn of others, of society; he will not be a passive \nsufferer and secret dreamer, nursing his own inner flame in oblivion. \nHe will plunge into life,\ninto the distractions of great undertakings, he will become a restless \nspirit . . . which wants to forget . . .  Or he will seek forgetfulness in \nsensuality, perhaps in debauchery. . . ,37\nI At its extreme, defiant self-creation can become demonic, a passion \n| which Kierkegaard calls “demoniac rage,” an attack on all of life \nJ for what it has dared to do to one, a revolt against existence itself. \n^  In our time we would have no trouble recognizing these forms \nof defiant self-creation. We can see their effects so clearly on both \nI personal and social levels. We are witness to the new cult of sen- \nj suality that seems to be repeating the sexual naturalism of the \ni ancient Roman world. It is a living for the day alone, with a \nI defiance of tomorrow; an immersion in the body and its immediate \nexperiences and sensations, in the intensity of touch, swelling flesh, \n! taste and smell. Its aim is to deny one s lack of control over events, \nhis powerlessness, his vagueness as a person in a mechanical world \nspinning into decay and death. I am not saying that this is bad, this \nrediscovery and reassertion of one’s basic vitality as an animal. The \nmodern world, after all, has wanted to deny the person even his\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 85\nOwn body, even his emanation from his animal center; it has wanted \nto make him completely a depersonalized abstraction. But man kept \nhis apelike body and found he could use it as a base for fleshy and \nhairy self-assertion—and damn the bureaucrats. The only thing that \nmight be undignified about it is its desperate reflexivity, a defiance \nthat is not reflective and so not completely self-possessed.\nSocially, too, we have seen a defiant Promethianism that is \nDasically innocuous: the confident power than can catapult man to \nthe moon and free him somewhat of his complete dependence and \nconfinement on earth—at least in his imagination. The ugly side of \nthis Promethianism is that it, too, is thoughtless, an empty-headed \nimmersion in the delights of technics with no thought to goals or \nmeaning; so man performs on the moon by hitting golf balls that do \nnot swerve in the lack of atmosphere. The technical triumph of a \nversatile ape, as the makers of the film 2001 so chillingly conveyed \nto us. On more ominous levels, as we shall develop later on, modem \nmans defiance of accident, evil, and death takes the form of sky­\nrocketing production of consumer and military goods. CanifidJtD.,. \nits demonic extreme this defiance gave us Hitler and Vietnam: a \nrage against our impotence, a defiance\"of our animal condition, our \npathetic creature limitations. If we don’t have the omnipotence of \ngods, we at least can destroy like gods.\nThe Meaning of Manhood\nKierkegaard did not need to live in our time to understand these \nthings. Like Burckhardt he already saw them prefigured in his own \nday because he understood what it costs to lie about oneself. All the \ncharacters he has so far sketched represent degrees of lying about \noneself in relation to the reality of the human condition. Kierke­\ngaard has engaged in this extremely difficult and unbelievably \nsubtle exercise for one reason and for one reason alone: to be able \nfinally to conclude with authority what a person would be like if \nhe did not lie. Kierkegaard wanted to show the many ways in \nwhich life bogs down and fails when man closes himself off against \nthe reality of his condition. Or at best, what an undignified and\n\f\n86 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nif pathetic creature man can be when he imagines that by living unto \nI himself alone he is fulfilling his nature. And now Kierkegaard offers \n; us the golden fruit of all his tortuous labors: instead of the dead- \n( ends of human impotence, self-centeredness, and self-destruction, he \nnow shows us what true possibility would be like for man.\n4  After all, Kierkegaard was hardly a disinterested scientist. He \ngave his psychological description because he had a glimpse of \nfreedom for man. He was a theorist of the open personality, of \nhuman possibility. In this pursuit, present-day psychiatry lags far \nbehind him. Kierkegaard had no easy idea of what “health” is. But \nhe knew what it was not: it was not normal adjustment—anything \nbut that, as he has taken such excruciating analytical pains to show \nus. To be a “normal cultural man” is, for Kierkegaard, tQ  be sick— \nwhether one knows it or not: “there is such a thing as fictitious \nhealth.”38 Nietzsche later put the same thought: “Are there perhaps \n—a question for psychiatrists—neuroses of health?” But Kierkegaard \nnot only posed the question, he also answered it. If health is not \n“cultural normality,” then it must refer to something else, must point \nbeyond mans usual situation, his habitual ideas. Mental health, in a \nword, is not typical, but ideal-typical. It is something far beyond \nman, something to be achieved, striven for, something that leads \nman beyond himself. The healthy person, the true individuals the \n!: self-realized soul, the 'real man. is the one who has transcended \nhirnsdf.39\nHow does one transcend himself; how does he open himself to \nnew possibility? By realizing the truth of his situation, by dispelling \nthe lie* of his character, by breaking his spirit out of its conditioned \nprison. The enemy, for Kierkegaard as for Freud, is the Oedipus \ncomplex. The.child has built up strategies and techniques for keep­\ning his self-esteem in the face of the terror of his situation. These \ntechniques become an armor that hold the person prisoner. The \nvery defenses that he needs in order to move about with self-con- \n^  fidence and self-esteem become his life-long trap. In order to \ntranscend himself he must break down that which he needs in order \nto live. Like Lear he must throw off all his “cultural lendings” and \nstand naked in th^jstonn ofijfe Kierkegaard had no illusions about \nman s urge to freedom. He knew how comfortable people were in­\nside the prison of their character defenses. Like many prisoners they\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 87\nare comfortable in their limited and protected routines, and the idea \nof a parole into the wide world of chance, accident, and choice \nterrifies them. We have only to glance back at Kierkegaards con­\nfession in the epigraph to this chapter to see why. In the prison of \none’s character one can pretend and feel tha.t_he tKat\n(tef'World is manageable, that there a treason {or, one’s life* a \nj^ady justification for one’s action. To live automatically and un­\ncritically is to be assured of at least a minimum share of the pro­\ngrammed cultural heroics—what we might call “prison heroism”: \nthe smugness of the insiders who “know.”\nKierkegaard's torment was the direct result of seeing the world \nas it really is in relation to his situation as a creature. The prison of \none’s character is painstakingly built; to dgny one thing and ofie \nthing “alone: one’s creatureliness. The creatureliness is the terror. \nOnce admit that you are a defecating creature and you invite the \nprimeval ocean of creature anxiety to flood over you. But it is more \ntihan creature anxiety, it is also man’s anxiety, the anxiety that re­\nsults from the human paradox that m anisan &jiirnal who is con­\nscious of his animal limitation. Anxiety is the result of the percep- \ntfftnof the truth of one’s conditionfWhat does it mean to be a \nself-conscious animal? The idea is ludicrous, if it is not monstrous.\nIt means to know that one is food for worms. This is the terror: to\nI\n have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, \ndeep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self- \nexpression—and with all this yet to die. It seems like a hoax, which \nis why one type of cultural man rebels openly against the idea of \nGod. What kind of deity would,create such complex,and faney^  \n\\&Q0n„ food? Cynical deities,/ said the Greeks, who use man’s tor- \nments for their own amusement.\nBut now Kierkegaard seems to have led us into an impasse, an \nimpossible situation. He has told us that by realizing the truths 5  \nour condition we can transcend ourselves. And on the other hand he ?  \ntells us that the truth of our condition is our complete and abject i \ncreatureliness, which seems to push us down still further on the \nscale of self-realization, further away from any possibility of self­\ntranscendence, But this is only an apparent contradiction. The flood \nof anxiety is not the end for man. It is, rather, a “school” that pro­\nvides man with the ultimate education, the final maturity. It is a\n\f\n88 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nbetter teacher than reality, says Kierkegaard,40 because reality can \nbe lied about, twisted, and tamed by the tricks of cultural percep­\ntion and repression. But anxiety cannot be lied about*. Once you \n\"face up to it, it reveals the truth of your situation; and only by \nseeing that truth can you open a new possibility for yourself. ”\n....\"***'\nHe who is educated by dread [anxiety] is educated by possibility. . . . \nWhen such a person, therefore, goes out from the school of possibility, \nand knows more thoroughly than a child knows the alphabet that he \ndemands of life absolutely nothing, and that terror, perdition,^annihila­\ntion, dweH next door to every man, and has learned the profitable lesson \nthat every dread which alarms may the next instant become a fact, he \nwill then interpret reality differently. . . .41\nNo mistake about it: the curriculum in the “school” of anxiety is. the \nunlearning of repression, of everything that the child taught him­\nself to deny so that he could move about with a minimal animal \nequanimity. Kierkegaard is thus placed directly in the Augustinian- \nLutheran tradition. Education for man means facing up to his \nnatural impotence and dg&fch.42 As Luther urged us: “I say die, i.e., \nFaste death as though it were present.” It is only if you “taste” death \nwith the lips of your living body that you can know emotionally \nthatyou are a creature who will die.\nWhat Kierkegaard is saying, in other words, is that the school of \nanxiety leads to possibility only by destroying the vital lie of \ncharacter. It seems like the ultimate self-defeat, the one thing that \none should not do, because then one will have truly nothing left. \nBut rest assured, says Kierkegaard, “the direction is quite normal \n. . . the self must be broken in order to become a self. . . ”43 William \nJames summed up beautifully this Lutheran tradition, in the follow­\ning words:\nThis is the salvation through self-despair, the dying to be truly bom, of \nLutheran theology, the passage into nothing of which Jacob Behmen \n[Boehme] writes. To get to it, a critical point must usually be passed, a \ncorner turned within one. Something must give way, a native hardness \nmust break down and liquefy. . . .44\nAgain—as we saw in the last chapter—this is the destruction of the \nemotional character armor of Lear, of the Zen Buddhists, of modern\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard 89\npsychotherapy, and in fact of self-realized men in any epoch. That \ngreat spirit, Ortega, has given us a particularly powerful phrasing \nof it. His statement reads almost exactly like Kierkegaard:\nThe man with the clear head is the man who frees himself from those \nfantastic “ideas” [the characterological lie about reality] and looks life \nIn the face, realizes that everything in it is problematic, and feels him- \nlelf. lost. And this is the simple truth—that to live is to feel oneself lost \n—he who accepts it has already begun to find himself, to be on firm \nground. Instinctively, as do the shipwrecked, he will look round for \nsomething to which to cling, and that tragic, ruthless glance* absolutely \nsincere, Tbecause it is a question of his salvation, will cause him to bring \norder into the chaos of his life, These are the only genuine ideas: the \nidfeas of the shipwrecked. All the rest is rhetoric, posturing, farce. He \nwho does not really feel himself lost, is without remission; that is to say, \nKe never finds himself, never comes up against his own, reaiityT^ ^  ^\nAnd so the arrival at new possibility, at new reality, by the de­\nstruction of the self through facing up to the anxiety of the terror \nof existence. The self must be destroyed, brought down to nothing, \niji order for self-transcendence to begia Then the self can begin to \nrelate itself to powers beypnd itself. It has to thrash around in its \nfimtude, it has to “die ” in order to question that finitude, in order \nto see beyond it. To what? Kierkegaard answers: Jg, infini{^d^ to \nabsolute transcendence, to the Ultimate Power of Creation which \nmade finite\" creatures. Our modern understanding of psycho- \ndynamics confirms that this progression is very logical: if you admit \nthat you are a creature, you accomplish one basic thing: you \ndggiolish all your unconscious power linkages or supports. As we \nsaw in the last chapter—and it is worth repeating here—each child \ngrounds himself in some power that transcends him. Usually it is a \ncombination of his parents, his social group, and the symbols of his \nsociety and nation. This is the unthinking web of support which \nallows him to believe in himself, as he functions on the automatic \nsecurity of delegated powers. He doesn’t of course admit to himself \nthat he lives on borrowed powers, as that would lead him to ques­\ntion his own secure action, the very confidence that he needs. He \nhas denied his creatureliness precisely by imagining that he has \nsecure power, and this secure power has been tapped by uncon­\n\f\n90 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nsciously leaning on the persons and things of his society. Once you \nexpose the basic weakness and emptiness of the person, his help­\nlessness, then you are forced to re-examine the whole problem of \npower linkages. You have to think about reforging them to a real \nsource of creative and generative power. It is at this point that one \ncaii begin to posit creatureliness vis-d-vis a Creator who is the \nFirst Cause of all created things, not merely the second-hand^ inter­\nmediate creators of society, the parents and the panoply of cultural \nheroes. These are the social and cultural progenitors who them­\nselves have been caused, who themselves are embedded in a web \nof someone else’s powers.\nOnce the person begins to look to his relationship to the Ultimate \nPower, to infinitude, and to refashion his links from those around \nhim to that Ultimate Power, he opens up to himself the horizon of \nunliimt^pQSSibility^.of real freedom. This is Kierkegaards mes­\nsage, the culmination of his whole argument about the dead-ends \nof character, the ideal of health, the school of anxiety, the nature \nof real possibility and freedom. One goes through it all to arrive \nat faith,Jhe faith that one s very creatureliness has some meaning to \na Creator; that despite one’s true insignificance, weakness, death, \none’s existence has meaning in some ultimate sense because it exists \nwithm an eternal and infinite scheme of things brought about and \nmaintained to some kind of design by some creative force. Again \nand again throughout his writings Kierkegaard repeats the basic \nformula of faith: one is a creature who can do nothing, but one \nexists over against a living God for whom “everything is possible.” \n- His whole argument now becomes crystal clear, as the keystone \nof faith crowns the structure. We can understand why anxiety “is \nthe possibility of freedom,” because anxiety demolishes “all finite \naims,” and so the “man who is educated by possibility is educated \nin accordance with his infinity.”46 Possibility leads nowhere if it \ndoes not lead to faith. It is p.n intermediate stage between cultural \nconditioning, the lie of character, and the opening out of infinitude \nto which one can be related by faith., But without the leap into \nfaith the new helplessness pf shedding one’s character armor holds \none in sheer terror.f It means that one lives unprotected by armor, \nexposed to his aloneness and helplessness, to constant anxiety. In \nKierkegaard*s words:\n\f\nThe Psychoanalyst Kierkegaard gi\n^!ow the dread of possibility holds him as its prey, until it can deliver \nhim saved into the hands of faith. In no other place does he find repose \n, , . he who went through the curriculum of misfortune offered by possi­\nbility lost everything, absolutely everything, in a way that no one has \nlost it in reality. If in this situation he did not behave falsely towards \npossibility, if he did not attempt to talk around the dread which would \niliye him, then he received everything back again, as in reality no one \never did even if he received everything tenfold, for the pupil of pos- \n' llbility received infinity.. . ,47\nI\nf If we put this whole progression in terms of our discussion of the\npossibilities of heroism, it goes like this: Man breaks through the \npounds of merely cultural heroism; he destroys the character lie \n/that had him perform as a hero in the everyday social scheme of \ntthings; and by doing so he opens himself up to infinity, to the pos- \nraility of cosmic heroism, to the very service of God. His life \nthereby acquires ultimate value in place of merely social and cul­\ntural, historical value. He links his secret inner self, his authentic \ntalent, his deepest feelings of uniqueness, his inner yearning for \nabsolute significance, to the very ground of creation. Out of the \nrpins of the broken cultural self there remains the mystery of the\ni\n)rivate, invisible, inner self which yearned for ultimate significance, \nor cosmic heroism. This invisible mystery at the heart of every \ncreature now attains cosmic significance by affirming its connection \nwith the invisible mystery at the heart of creation. This is the \nmeaning of faith. At the same time it is the meaning of the merger \nof psychology and religion in Kierkegaard’s thought. The truly open \nperson, the one who has shed his character armor, the vital lie of \nhis cultural conditioning, is beyond the help of any mere “science,” \nof any merely social standard of health. He JLbsdutely. alpne and \ntumbling on the brink of oblivion—which is at the s^mejime the \nl^rink of infinity. To give him the new support that he needs, the \n\"courage to renounce dread without any dread . . . only faith is \ncapable of,’’ says Kierkegaard. Not that this is an easy out for man, \nor a cure-all for the human condition—Kierkegaard is never facile. \nHe gives a strikingly beautiful idea:\nnot that [faith] annihilates dread, but remaining ever young, it is con­\ntinually developing itself out of the death throe of dread.48\n\f\nIn other words, as long as man is an ambiguous creature he can \nnever banish anxiety; what he can do instead is to use anxiety as an \neternal spring for growth into new dimensions of thought and trust. \nFaith poses a new life task, the adventure in openness., to ^.multi­\ndimensional reality.\nWe can understand why Kierkegaard had only to conclude his \ngreat study of anxiety with the following words which have the \nweight of an apodictic argument:\nXhfe. true autodidact [i.e., the one who by himself goes through the \nschool of anxiety to faith] is precisely in the same degree a theodidact \n... So soon as psychology has finished with dread, it has nothing to do \nbut to deliver it over to dogmatics.49\nIn Kierkegaard, psychology and religion, philosophy and science, \npoetry and truth merge indistinguishably together in the yearning \nof the creature.50\nLet us now turn to the other towering figure in the history of \npsychology who had the same yearning, but for whom these things \ndid not consciously merge. Why is it that probably the two greatest \nstudents of human nature could hold such diametrically opposed \nopinions of the reality of faith?\n92 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

All neurotics, and\nmany others too, take exception to the fact that \n“inter urinas et faeces nascimur”. . . . Thus we \nshould find, as the deepest root of the sexual \nrepression that marches with culture, the organic \ndefense of the new form of life that \nbegan with the erect posture. \n— Sigmund Freud1\nI have tried in a few pages to show that Kierkegaard understood \nthe problem of human character and growth with an acuity that \nshowed the uncanny mark of genius, coming as it did so long before \nclinical psychology. He anticipated some of the fundamentals of \npsychoanalytic theory and pushed beyond that theory to the prob­\nlem of faith and so to the deepest understanding of man. This state­\nment has to be defended, which is one of the tasks of this book. \nInevitably, part of that defense must be some kind of sketch of the \nproblem of Freud’s character as I see it. Freud also pushed psycho­\nanalytic theory to its limits but did not come out at faith; his \ncharacter should tell us at least some of the reason.\n93\n\f\n94 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nPsychoanalysis as a Doctrine about Mans Creatureliness\nOne of the striking things about the Freudian revolution in \nthought is that we still haven't been able to digest it, nor have we \nbeen able to ignore it. Freudianism stands over and against con­\ntemporary man like an accusing specter. In this sense, as many have \nremarked, Freud is like a Biblical prophet, a religious iconoclast \nwho spoke a truth that no one wants to hear and no one may ever \nwant to hear. And that truth is, as Norman 0. Brown reminded us, \nthat Freud had no illusions about man’s basic creatureliness; he \neven quoted St. Augustine.2 On the problem of mans basic creature­\nliness Freud evidently felt an affinity with a religion that he other­\nwise had no high opinion of—to put it mildly. He had no high \nopinion of any religion and yet, in a matter as fundamental as the \nbasic nature of man, we could stand him shoulder to shoulder with \nthe Augustinian Kierkegaard.\nThis is a crucial matter; it explains why Freud’s very pessimism \nand cynicism is still the most contemporary thing about his thought: \nit is a pessimism grounded in reality, in scientific truth. But it ex­\nplains much more. Freud’s dogged insistence on mans creature­\nliness explains almost all by itself why he insisted on an instinctual \nview of man, that is, it explains what is wrong with psychoanalytic \ntheory. At the same time, with a slight twist to that theory, such as \nwas given first by Rank and now by Brown, the psychoanalytic \nemphasis on creatureliness emerges as the lasting insight on human \ncharacter.\nOn the first point, Freud’s insistence on creatureliness as instinc­\ntive behavior, there has been no better revelation than in Jung’s \nautobiography. Jung recalls the two occasions, in 1907 and 1910, \nwhen he discovered that he could never be friends with Freud \nbecause he could never follow the bias of his sexual theory. Let me \nuse Jungs own words at some length to report on this critical en­\ncounter in the history of thought at the 1910 meeting in Vienna:\nI can still recall vividly how Freud said to me, \"My dear Jung, promise \nme never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thing \nof all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark.”\n\f\nHo said that to me with great emotion, in the tone of a father saying, \n\"And promise me this one thing, my dear son: that you will go to church \nO V t f r y  Sunday.” In some astonishment I asked him, “A bulwark—against \nwhftt?” To which he replied, “Against the black tide of mud”—and he \n(M ilitated for a moment, then added—“of occultism.” . . . What Freud \nItflmcd to mean by “occultism” was virtually everything that philosophy \nRnd religion, including the rising contemporary science of parapsychology, \nhad learned about the psyche.\nAnd about the earlier 1907 meeting, Jung reveals:\nAbove all, Freud's attitude toward the spirit seemed to me highly ques­\ntionable. Wherever, in a person or in a work of art, an expression of \nspirituality (in the intellectual, not the supernatural sense) came to light, \nhe suspected it, and insinuated that it was repressed sexuality. Anything \nthat could not be directly interpreted as sexuality he referred to as “psy- \nchosexuality.” I protested that this hypothesis, carried to its logical con­\nclusion, would lead to an annihilating judgment upon culture. Culture \nwould then appear as a mere farce, the morbid consequence of repressed \nsexuality. “Yes,” he assented, “so it is, and that is just a curse of fate \nagainst which we are powerless to contend.” . . . There was no mistaking \nthe fact that Freud was emotionally involved in his sexual theory to an \nextraordinary degree. When he spoke of it, his tone became urgent, al­\nmost anxious. . . .  A strange, deeply moved expression came over his \nface.. . .3\nFor Jung, such an attitude was unacceptable because it was not \nscientific. Freud seemed to him to have abandoned his normally \ncritical and skeptical manner:\nTo me the sexual theory was just as occult, that is to say, just as un­\nproven an hypothesis, as many other speculative views. As I saw it, a \nscientific truth was a hypothesis which might be adequate for the moment \nbut was not to be preserved as an article of faith for all time.4\nJung was confused and put off by this aspect of Freud, but today \nit is very clear to us what was at stake. Freud evidently had the \nmost intense belief that his authentic talent, his most private and \ncherished self-image and his mission for that talent, was that of a \ntruth-teller on the unspeakables of the human condition. He saw\nThe Problem of Freud’s Character, Noch Einmal 95\n\f\nthese unspeakables as instinctive sexuality and instinctive aggression \nin the service of that sexuality. “Won’t they get a surprise when they \nhear what we have to say to them!” he exclaimed to Jung as they \nsighted the New York skyline in 1909.5 The “occult” was anything \nthat lied about mans basic creatureliness, anything that tried to \nmake out of a man a lofty, spiritual creator, qualitatively different \nfrom the animal kingdom. This kind of self-deluding and self-inflat- \ning “occultism” was ingrained in the human spirit, a matter of smug \nsocial agreement; it had been preached in all climates and from \nall pulpits, both religious and secular, for too long, had obscured \nmans real motive. It was now up to psychoanalysis all alone to \nattack this age-old mask, smash at it with a counter-dogma securely \nplaced on an unshakable bulwark. Nothing weaker would do; noth­\ning less could attack so ancient and formidable an enemy as human \nself-deception. And so we have the emotion of Freud’s earliest \nentreaties to Jung, as well as the serious and measured scientific \ndebunking of his very last writings, as in the epigraph of this chap­\nter. His life identity was single and unbroken.\nIt is clear to us today, too, that Freud was wrong about the \ndogma, just as Jung and Adler knew right at the beginning. Man \nhas no innate instincts of sexuality and aggression. Now we are \nseeing something more, the new Freud emerging in our time, that \nhe was right in his dogged dedication to revealing man’s creature­\nliness. His emotional involvement was correct. It reflected the true \nintuitions of genius, even though the particular intellectual counter­\npart of that emotion—the sexual theory—proved to be wrong. Man’s \nbody was “a curse of fate,” and culture was built upon repression— \nnot because man was a seeker only of sexuality, of pleasure, of life \nand expansiveness, as Freud thought, but because man was also \nprimarily an avoider of death. Consciousness of death is the primary \nrepression, not sexuality. As Rank unfolded in book after book, and \nas Brown has recently again argued, the new perspective on psy­\nchoanalysis is that its crucial concept is the repression of death.6 \nThis is what is creaturely about man, this is the repression on which \nculture is built, a repression unique to the self-conscious animal. \nFreud saw the curse and dedicated his life to revealing it with all \nthe power at his command. But he ironically missed the precise \nscientific reason for the curse.\n96 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

    "raw_text": "This is one of the reasons that his life until the very end was a \ndialogue with himself on the mainsprings of human motives. Freud \ntugged at his work, tried to get the truth to emerge more clearly \nand starkly, and yet always it seemed to become more shaded, more \ncomplex, more elusive. We admire Freud for his serious dedica­\ntion, his willingness to retract, the stylistic tentativeness of some of \nhis assertions, his lifelong review of his pet notions/ We admire \nhim for his very deviousness, his hedgings, and his misgivings, be­\ncause they seem to make of him more of an honest scientist, re­\nflecting truthfully the infinite manifold of reality. But this is to ad­\nmire him for the wrong reason. A basic cause for his own lifelong \ntwistings was that he would never cleanly leave the sexual dogma, \nnever clearly see or admit that the terror of death was the basic \nrepression.\nThe Problem, of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal g7\nThe First Great Reluctance of Freud: \nthe Idea of Death\nIt would take us into too much complexity to try to trace this \nproblem using the writings of Freud as evidence. We mentioned \nearlier that in his later work he moved away from narrow sexual \nformulations of the Oedipus complex and turned more to the nature \nof life itself, to the general problems of human existence. We might \nsay that he moved from a father-fear theory of culture to a nature- \nterror one.7 But, as always, he hedged. He never became frankly \nan existentialist but remained bound to his instinct theory.\nThere seems to have been a certain reluctance in Freud, and \nwithout attempting to probe minutely into his writings, I think that \nthis reluctance can be revealed by one key idea. This is the most \nimportant idea that emerged in his later writings, the “death in­\nstinct.” After reading his introduction of this idea in Beyond the \nPleasure Principle the conclusion seems to me inescapable that the \nidea of a “death instinct” was an attempt to patch up the instinct\n• But see Paul Roazen’s insight into how confident Freud was behind his \nuse of style.

It was becoming difficult to maintain the \ncasuistry of the dream theory that all dreams, even anxiety dreams, \nare fulfillments of wishes.8 It was becoming difficult to maintain the \nfundamental assertion of psychoanalysis that man is purely a \npleasure-seeking animal.9 Also, man’s terrors, his struggles with and \nagainst himself and others, were not easily explainable as an in­\nstinctual conflict between sexuality and aggression—especially when \nthe individual was thought to be animated by Eros, by the libido, \nby the raw life force that seeks its own satisfaction and expansion.10 \nFreud’s new idea of the “death instinct” was a device that enabled \nhim to keep intact the earlier instinct theory, now by attributing \nhuman evil to a deeper organic substratum than merely ego con­\nflict with sexuality. He now held that there was a built-in urge \ntoward death as well as toward life; and thereby he could explain \nviolent human aggression, hate, and evil in a new—yet still bio­\nlogical—way: Human aggressiveness comes about through a fusion \nof the life instinct and the death instinct. The death instinct repre­\nsents the organism’s desire to die, but the organism can save itself \nfrom its own impulsion toward death by redirecting it outward. The \ndesire to die, then, is replaced by the desire to kill, and man defeats \nhis own death instinct by killing others. Here then was a simple \nnew dualism that tidied up the libido theory, that allowed Freud to \nkeep it as the bulwark of his main prophetic task: to proclaim man \nfirmly embedded in the animal kingdom. Freud could still keep his \nbasic allegiance to physiology, chemistry, and biology and his hopes \nfor a total and simple reductionist science of psychology.11\nAdmittedly, by talking about defusing the instinct to die by kill­\ning others, Freud did get at the connection between one’s own \ndeath and the butchery practiced by mankind. But he got at it at \nthe price of continually intruding instincts into explanations of \nhuman behavior. Again, we see how the fusion of truthful insight \nwith fallacious explanation has made it so difficult to untangle \nFreud. He seems to have been unable to reach for the really direct \nexistentialist level of explanation, to establish both man’s continuity \nand his difference from the lower animals on the basis of his protest\n\f\nagainst death rather than his built-in instinctive urge toward it. The \nfearfulness of human aggression, the ease with which the animal\nS\novemed by Eros slaughters other living things, would be explained \ny such a theory even more simply and directly.12 Killing is a sym­\nbolic solution of a biological limitation; it results from the fusion of \nthe biological level (animal anxiety) with the symbolic one (death \nfear) in the human animal. As we will see in the next section, no \nOne explained this dynamic more elegantly than Rank: “the death f \nfear of the ego is lessened by the killing, the sacrifice, of the other \nthrough the death of the other, one buys oneself free from the \npenalty of dying, of being killed.”13 \nFreuds tortuous formulations on the death instinct can now \niccurely be relegated to the dust bin of history. They are of in­\nterest only as the ingenious efforts of a dedicated prophet to main­\ntain intellectually intact his basic dogma. But the second conclusion \nthat we draw from Freud’s labors on that problem is much more \nimportant. Despite all his leanings toward the idea of death, the \nhopeless situation of the child, the real terror of the external world, \nand the like, Freud did not need to give them a central place in his \nthought. He did not need to rework his vision of man from that of \nprimarily a pleasure-seeker of sex to that of the terrified, death- \navoiding animal. All he had to do was to say that man carried death \nwithin him unconsciously as part of his biology. The fiction of death \nas an “instinct” allowed Freud to keep the terror of death outside \nhis formulations as a primary human problem of ego mastery. He \n, did not have to say that death was repressed if the organism carried \nit naturally in its processes.14 In this formulation, it is not a general \nhuman problem, much less the primary human problem, but is \nmagically transformed, as Rank so succinctly put it, “from an un- \nWished-for necessity to a desired instinctual goal.” He adds that \n*the comfort-giving nature of this ideology could stand neither logic \nnor experience for long.”15 In this way, as Rank says, Freud dis­\nposed of the “death problem” and made it into a “death instinct”:\n. . . even when he finally stumbled upon the inescapable death problem, \nhe sought to give a new meaning to that also in harmony with the wish, \nSince he spoke of death instinct instead of death fear. The fear itself he\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 99\n\f\n1\nhad meantime disposed of elsewhere, where it was not so threatening.... \n[He] made the general fear into a special sexual fear (castration fear)\n. . . [and then sought] to cure this fear through the freeing of sexuality.1*\nThis is a superb critique of psychoanalysis still today. As Rank \nlamented,\nIf one had held to the phenomena, it would be impossible to understand \nhow a discussion of the death impulse could neglect the universal and \nfundamental death fear to such an extent as is the case in psychoanalytic \nliterature.17\nThe psychoanalytic literature remained almost silent on the fear of \ndeath until the late 1930’s and World War II. And the reason was \nas Rank revealed: how could psychoanalytic therapy scientifically \ncure the terror of life and death? But it could cure the problems of \nsex, which it itself posited.1 8\nBut more to the point of our discussion is whether the fiction of \nthe death instinct revealed anything in Freud’s personal attitude \ntoward reality. Rank intimates that it did, by mentioning the \n“threatening” nature of the death fear—threatening, one must as­\nsume, not only to Freud’s systematic theory. Another writer also \nsays that it is highly probable that the idea of death as a natural \ngoal of life brought some peace to Freud.19 And so we are back to \nFreuds personal character and whatever edification we can get \nfrom it, specifically in relation to the most fundamental and terrify­\ning problem of a human life.\nFortunately, thanks largely to Ernest Jones’s biographical labor \nof love, we have a well-documented picture of Freud the man. We \nknow about his lifelong migraines, his sinus, his prostate trouble, \nhis lengthy constipations, his compulsive smoking of cigars. We \nhave a picture of how suspicious he was of people around him, how \nhe wanted loyalty and recognition of his seniority and priority as a \nthinker; how ungenerous he was toward dissenters like Adler, Jung, \nand Rank. His famous comment on Adler’s death is absolutely \ncynical:\nFor a Jew-boy out of a Viennese suburb a death in Aberdeen is an un­\n100 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe Problem of Freud's Character, Noch Einmal 101\nheard-of career in itself, and a proof how far he had got on. The world \nHilly rewarded him richly for his service of contradicting psychoanalysis.!\nIn his early years especially, Freud worked like a frenzy. This \nr kind of frenzy requires a certain kind of work atmosphere—and\n*  Preud didn’t hesitate to structure his family relations around his \nWork in a truly patriarchal way. At the noonday meal after his \npsychoanalytic interviews he observed a strict silence but required \niveryone to be there; if there were an empty chair he would \ngesticulate questioningly with his fork to Martha about the absence. \nThe completely rapt and slavish attitude of his daughter Anna \nalarmed even him, and he sent her to be analyzed; it is as though \nhe was unaware of how his own staging of his greatness in the \nfamily could not fail to mesmerize those around him. We know he \ntook his long vacation trips with his brother but never with his wife \nand in dozens of ways arranged his life to reflect his own sense of \nmission and historical destiny.\nNone of this is unusual: it is just interesting gossip about a great \nman. I mention it merely to show that Freud was neither better \nnor worse than other men. He seems to have had more narcissism \nthan most, but his mother had raised him that way, as the special \nfocus of attention and of her high hopes; she called him “my golden \nSigi” until her death. His whole life style was of a dramatistic piece \nwith the way he had always been treated. Certainly his mother’s \nattitude had given him some added strength, as he remarked; and \nhe carried his incurable cancer, with its horrible and painful effects, \nwith an admirable dignity and patience. But is this, too, so truly\nf Jones’s biography, for all the wealth of candid detail it reveals about \nFreud, is tailored to give an heroic image of him; it is now generally agreed \nthat it is hardly the last word in objectivity about Freud the man. Erich \nFromm has shown this very pointedly in his Sigmund Freud's Mission: An \nAnalysis of His Personality and Influence (New York: Grove Press, 1959)* \nRecently, Paul Roazen has re-examined the Jones archives, along with much \nOther digging, to present a more roundedly “human” picture of Freud. See \nhis important book Brother Animal, and compare especially Freuds comments \non Tausk (p. 140) to the quotation on Adler. We will introduce later more \nof Roazen’s perspective on Freud’s character. Another excellent human portrait \nof Freud is Helen Walker Puners brilliant critical biography: Freud, His Life \nand His Mind (London: The Grey Walls Press, 1949).\n\f\n*\nout of the ordinary? Someone once lauded to him Franz Rosen- \nzweig’s courageous tolerance of his total paralysis, and Freud re­\nsponded “What else can he do?” The same remark can be turned on \nFreud, as it can on all of us who suffer from illness. As for his \ndedication to his work, writing to the end with as little use of drugs \nas possible despite his pain—didn’t Georg Simmel also continue to \nthe end with his cancer, also refusing medication because it dulled \nhis thought? Yet no one thinks of Simmel as a particularly strong \ncharacter. This kind of courage is not unusual in men who see \nthemselves as historical figures; the self-image marshals the neces- \nsary dedication to the work that will give them immortality; what \nis pain next to that? I think we can fairly conclude that in all this \nthere was hardly anything about Freud that would mark him off \nfrom other men. Freud in his self-centeredness; Freud at home \nruling the roost and revolving family life around his own work and \nambitions; Freud in his interpersonal life, trying to influence and \ncoerce others, wanting special esteem and loyalty, mistrusting \nothers, lashing out at them with cutting and denigrating epithets; \nin all these things Freud is everyman, at least everyman who has \nthe talent and style to be able to pull off the scenario that he would \nlike.\nBut Freud was hardly the “immediate” man, dashing headlong \ninto life without reflection. In the ways we just sketched he was \nordinary; in one great way he was extraordinary—and it was this \nthat fed directly into his genius: He was extremely self-analytic, \nlifted the veil from his own repressions, and tried to decipher his \ndeepest motivations to the very end of his life. We remarked pre­\nviously on what the death instinct might have meant to Freud per­\nsonally, and this subject is out in the open. Unlike most men, Freud \nwas conscious of death as a very personal and intimate problem. \nHe was haunted by death anxiety all his life and admitted that not \na day went by that he did not think about it. This is clearly unusual \nfor the run of mankind; and it is here, I think, that we can justi­\nfiably fish around for some hints about Freud’s special orientation \nto reality and about a “problem” unique to him. If we get hints of \nsuch a problem, I think we can use it to throw light on the overall \nstructure of his work and its possible limits.\nFreud’s experiences seem to show two different approaches to\n102 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

    "raw_text": "the problem of death. The first is what we might call a fairly routine \nCompulsiveness, a magic toying with the idea. For example, he \nseems to have played with the date of his death all his life. His \nfriend Fliess played mystically with numbers, and Freud believed \nin his ideas. When Fliess predicted Freuds death at 51, according \nto his calculations, Freud “thought it more likely he would die in \nthe forties from rupture of the heart.”20 When the age of 51 passed \nuneventfully, “Freud adopted another superstitious belief—that he \nhad to die in February, 1918 ”21 Freud often wrote and spoke to his \ndisciples about his growing old, that he had not long to live. He \nespecially feared dying before his mother because he was terrified \nat the thought that she might have to hear of his death, which \nwould cause her grief. He had similar fears about dying before his \nfather. Even as a young man he was in the habit of taking leave of \nfriends by saying “Goodbye, you may never see me again.”\nWhat are we to make of all this? I think it is a fairly routine and \nsuperficial way of handling the problem of death. All these ex­\namples seem to boil down to “magical control games.” Freud s con­\ncern for his mother seems like transparent displacement and ration­\nalization: “My death does not terrify me, what terrifies me is the \nthought of the grief it would cause her.” One is frightened by the \nemptiness, the gap that would be left by one’s disappearance. One \ncant cope easily with it, but one can cope with someone else’s \ngrief over ones disappearance. Instead of experiencing the stark \nterror of losing oneself as a disappearing object, one clings to the \nimage of someone else. There is nothing complicated in Freud’s use \nof these intellectual devices.\nBut there is another side to Freud’s response to the problem of \ndeath that is very confused. According to his biographer Jones, \nFreud was subject to periodic anxiety attacks in which the anxiety \nwas localized as a real dread of dying and of traveling by rail.22 In \nhis attacks of dread of dying he had images of himself dying and \nof farewell scenes.23 Now this is quite a different matter than com­\npulsive, magical games with the idea of death. Here Freud seems to \nhave unrepressed the thought of his own fading away and to have \nresponded to it with full emotional anxiety. The train anxiety is of \ncourse a slight displacement, but not as uncontrolled as a phobia \nwould be, as Jones agrees.24\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 103\n\f\nNow, right away we see problems with this line of speculation. \nIt is impossible to be clear about these things when you are dealing \nwith them at such a distance, with printed words and not the living \nman. We don’t know exactly how the mind works in relation to \nemotion, how deeply words go when dealing with reality or with \nrepressions. Sometimes just to admit an idea to consciousness is to \nexperience that idea vitally. At other times to admit even a deep \nanxiety may not mean the actual experience of that anxiety, at \nleast not the deep experience of it, as something else may be \ntroubling the person. Psychoanalysts talk about anxiety without \naffect. Can one admit the terror of death and still not experience it \non deeper levels? Are images of dying and farewell as deep as the \nreal feeling that one has absolutely no power to oppose death? To \nwhat extent can there be a partial rationalization of even the \ndeepest anxiety? Or do these relationships change according to the \nperiod in one’s life, the stress one is under?\nThere is no way to be clear about these subjects in the case of \nFreud. Jones himself is quite puzzled by Freud’s different ways of \nreacting to the problem of death—on the one hand, anxiety attacks, \norr the other, heroic resignation. And in his attempt to understand \nthem he says:\nFreud always faced with complete courage any real danger to his life, \nwhich proves that the neurotic dread of dying must have had some other \nmeaning than the literal one.25\nNot necessarily: one can face up to the real danger of a known \ndisease, as Freud did, because it gives one an object, an adversary, \nsomething against which to marshal ones courage; disease and \ndying are still living processes in which one is engaged. But to fade \naway, leave a gap in the world, disappear into oblivion—that is \nquite another matter.\nYet Jones’s statement offers us a real clue about Freud because, \nit seems to me, he is saying that there is a difference between the \nfact of death and the justification of it. As one’s whole life is a style \nor a scenario with which one tries to deny oblivion and to extend \noneself beyond death in symbolic ways, one is often untouched by \nthe fact of his death because he has been able to surround it by\n104 THE DENIAL of death"

We can try to get \n!\" ftt what bothered him by clues from the larger style of his life, in- \n, Itead of by the fruitless method of trying to speculate about how \nt; deeply his thoughts made contact with his emotions.\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 105\nThe Second Great Reluctance of Freud\n' 1\nThe first thing that seems to emerge clearly about Freud’s stance \ntoward reality is that, like many men, he had great trouble yielding. \nHe could submit neither to the world nor to other men. He tried \nto keep a center of gravity within himself and not to let go of him- \nlelf and place that center elsewhere, as is clear from his relation­\nship to his disciples, to dissenters, and to external threats of all \nkinds. When at the time of the Nazi invasion his daughter won­\ndered why they did not all just kill themselves, Freud character­\nistically remarked, “Because that is exactly what they want us to \ndo.”\nBut Freud was ambivalent about yielding. There is a lot to \nsuggest that he toyed with the idea. A very telling anecdote is his \nremark when the superstitious date he had set for his death, Feb- \ni ruary of 1918, passed uneventfully. He remarked: “That shows what\nV little trust one can place in the supernatural.”26 This is a marvelous \n£\"■ example of how one can toy with the idea of submission to larger \nl ;i, laws and powers, but only in one’s mind, dishonestly, while re- \nmaining emotionally aloof and unyielding. But there are other re- \n'ij ports that suggest that Freud not only played with yielding but \nactually longed to be able to shift his center elsewhere. Once while \nH discussing psychic phenomena, Jones made the remark: “If one \nIpould believe in mental processes floating in the air, one could go \nfpn to a belief in angels.” At which point Freud closed the discussion \n■J'with the comment: “Quite so, even der liebe Goti” Jones goes on to \n'|say that the words of Freud were said in a jocular, slightly quizzical \ny tone. But Jones was clearly put off by the master's broaching the \nproblem of a belief in God without a firmly negative stance. He \nreports: “. . . there was something searching also in the glance, and\n\f\nI went away not entirely happy lest there be some more serious \nundertone as well.”27\nOn another occasion Freud met a sister of a former patient who \nhad died some time earlier. The sister bore a resemblance to her \ndead brother, and a spontaneous thought passed through Freuds \nmind: “So after all, it is true that the dead may return.” Zilboorg, \nin his important discussion of Freud and religion, makes the follow­\ning comment on this episode, as well as on Freud’s whole am­\nbivalent stance toward supernaturalism:\nEven though Freud related that this thought was followed at once by a \nsense of shame, the fact remains undeniable that there was a strong \nemotional “streak” in Freud which bordered now on superstition, then \non belief in the physical immortality of man here on earth.\nIt becomes also clear that Freud fought deliberately against certain \nspiritual trends within himself. . . . [He] seems to have been in a state \nof searching and painful conflict in which the positivist scholar (con­\nscious) and the potential believer (unconscious) fought an open battle.28\nZilboorg then makes the following conclusion about these spiritual \ntrends, a conclusion that supports our view that Freud was toying \nambivalently with yielding to transcendent powers, being very \ntempted in that direction:\nThese trends tried to assert themselves by way of the well-known mech­\nanism of distortion and secondary elaboration, described by Freud as \ncharacteristic of the unconscious and dreams. The trend took the form of \nanxious little superstitions, of involuntary and unreasonable beliefs in \nwhat the common jargon calls spiritualism.29\nIn other words, Freud gave as much vent to his spiritual trends as \nhis character allowed him to, without his having to remake the basic \nfoundations of that character. The most he could do was to give \nway to common superstitions. I think this conclusion is beyond dis­\npute on the basis of Jones’s reports alone; but we also have Freud’s \ntelling personal admission that “my own superstition has its roots \nin suppressed ambition (immortality). . . .”30 That is, it has its roots \nin the strictly spiritual problem of transcending death, a problem \nthat for Freud was characteristically one of ambition, of striving, \nand not of trust or yielding.\n106 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe very next logical and vital question is this: what makes the \nmatter of yielding an ambivalent one, so difficult for Freud? The \nsame reason that makes it so for everyman. To yield is to disperse \nones shored-up center, let down ones guard, ones character armor, \nadmit ones lack of self-sufficiency. And this shored-up center, this \nguard, this armor, this supposed self-sufficiency are the very things \nthat the entire project of coming-of-age from childhood to manhood \nis all about. Here we have to recall our discussion in Chapter Three \nwhere we saw that the basic task that the person cuts out for him­\nself is the attempt to father himself—what Brown so well calls the \n\"Oedipal project.” The causa-sui passion is an energetic fantasy that \ncovers over the rumbling of man’s fundamental creatureliness, or \nwhat we can now more pointedly call his hopeless lack of genuine \ncentering on his own energies to assure the victory of his life. No \ncreature can assure this, and man can only attempt to do so in his \nfantasy. The ambivalence of the causa-sui project is based on the \never-present threat of reality that peeks through. One suspects at \nall times that one is fundamentally helpless and impotent, but one \nmust protest against it. The fathers and mothers always cast their \nshadow. What, then, is the problem of yielding? It represents \nnothing less than the abandonment of the causa-sui project, the \ndeepest, completest, total emotional admission that there is no \nstrength within oneself, no power fo bear the superfluity of ex­\nperience. To yield is to admit that support has to come from outside \noneself and that justification for ones life has to come totally from \nsome self-transcending web in which one consents to be suspended \n—as a child in its hammock-cradle, glaze-eyed in helpless, de­\npendent admiration of the cooing mother.\nIf the causa-sui project is a lie that is too hard to admit because \nit plunges one back to the cradle, it is a lie that must take its toll \nas one tries to avoid reality. This brings us to the very heart of our \ndiscussion of Freuds character. Now we can talk pointedly about \nhis engineering of his causa-sui project, and we can connect it with \nhis absolute denial of threatening reality. I am referring, of course, \nto the two occasions on which Freud fainted. Fainting represents, \nin these cases, the ultimate denial—the refusal or inability to re­\nmain conscious in the face of a threat. The two occasions on which \na great man loses complete control of himself must contain some\nThe Problem of Freud’s Character, Noch Einmal 107\n\f\n1\nvital intelligence about the very heart of his life-problem. Fortu­\nnately we have Jungs first-hand reports of both incidents, and I \nwould like to quote him in full.\nThe first fainting took place in Bremen in 1909, while Freud and \nJung were on their way to the United States to lecture about their \nwork. Jung says that this incident was provoked—indirectly—by his \ninterest in the “peat-bog corpses”:\nI knew that in certain districts of Northern Germany these so-called bog \ncorpses were to be found. They are the bodies of prehistoric men who \neither drowned in the marshes or were buried there. The bog water in \nwhich the bodies lie contains humic acid, which consumes the bones and \nsimultaneously tans the skin, so that it and the hair are perfectly pre \nserved.. ..\nHaving read about these peat-bog corpses, I recalled them when vve \nwere in Bremen, but, being a bit muddled, confused them with the \nmummies in the lead cellars of the city. This interest of mine got on \nFreuds nerves. “Why are you so concerned with these corpses?” he asked \nme several times. He was inordinately vexed by the whole thing and \nduring one such conversation, while we were having dinner together, he \nsuddenly fainted. Afterward he said to me that he was convinced that \nall this chatter about corpses meant that I had death-wishes toward \nhim.31\nThe second fainting incident occurred in 1912 at the time of a \nspecial strategy meeting that brought Freud and some of his fol­\nlowers together in Munich. Here is Jungs intimate report of the \nincident:\nSomeone had turned the conversation to Amenophis IV (Ikhnaton). The \npoint was made that as a result of his negative attitude toward his father \nhe had destroyed his fathers cartouches on the steles, and that at the \nback of his great creation of a monotheistic religion there lurked a father \ncomplex. This sort of thing irritated me, and I attempted to argue that \nAmenophis had been a creative and profoundly religious person whose \nacts could not be explained by personal resistances toward his father. On \nthe contrary, I said, he had held the memory of his father in honor, and \nhis zeal for destruction had been directed only against the name of the \ngod Amon, which he had everywhere annihilated; it was also chiseled \nout of the cartouches of his father Amon-hotep.

Yet they, I pointed out, had \ninaugurated neither a new style nor a new religion.\nAt that moment Freud slid off his chair in a faint.32\nThe Faintings in Relation to Freuds \nGeneral Life-Problem\nThere has been a lot of interpretation of the meaning of these \nfainting episodes by many sensitive students of Freud’s life; Freud \nand Jung both gave their own interpretations. I am lingering on this \nsubject not only because it may unlock the problem of Freuds \ncharacter, but because it confirms better than anything, I think, the \nwhole post-Freudian understanding of man that we have sketched \nin the first five chapters. We get the clearest understanding when \nwe can reflect abstractions in the living mirror of a great man's \nlife.\nIt was Paul Roazen who, in his recent brilliant interpretation, \nrevealed the central meaning of these fainting spells.33 Like Rank, \nRoazen understood that the psychoanalytic movement as a whole \nwas Freuds distinctive causa-sui project; it was his personal vehicle \nfor heroism, for transcendence of his vulnerability and human \nlimitations. As we will see in the following chapters, Rank was the \none who showed that the true genius has an immense problem that \nother men do not. He has to earn his value as a person from his \nwork, which means that his work has to carry the burden of justify­\ning him. What does “justifying” mean for man? It means transcend­\ning death by qualifying for immortality. The genius repeats the \nnarcissistic inflation of the child; he lives the fantasy of the control \nof life and death, of destiny, in the “body” of his work. The unique­\nness of the genius also cuts off his roots. He is a phenomenon that \nwas not foreshadowed; he doesn't seem to have any traceable debts \nto the qualities of others; he seems to have sprung self-generated \nout of nature. We might say that he has the “purest” causa-sui \nproject: He is truly without a family, the father of himself. As"

    "raw_text": "110 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nRoazen points out, Freud had soared so far beyond his natural \nfamily that it is no surprise that he should indulge in fantasies of \nself-creation: “Freud came back again and again to the fantasy of \nbeing raised father-less.”34 Now, you cannot become your own \nfather until you can have your own sons, as Roazen so well says; \nand natural-born sons would not do, because they do not have “the \nqualities of immortality associated with genius.”35 This formulation \nis perfect. Ergo, Freud had to create a whole new family—the \npsychoanalytic movement—that would be his distinctive im­\nmortality-vehicle. When he died the genius of the movement would \nassure his eternal remembrance and hence an eternal identity in \nthe minds of men and in the effects of his work on earth.\nBut now the problem of the causa-sui project of the genius. In \nthe normal Oedipal project the person internalizes the parents and \nthe superego they embody, that is, the culture at large. But the \ngenius cannot do this because his project is unique; it cannot be \nfilled up by the parents or the culture. It is created specifically by \na renunciation of the parents, a renunciation of what they repre­\nsent and even of their own concrete persons—at least in fantasy— \nas there doesn’t seem to be anything in them that has caused the \ngenius. Here we see whence the genius gets his extra burden of \nguilt: he has renounced the father both spiritually and physically. \nThis act gives him extra anxiety because now he is vulnerable in his \nturn, as he has no one to stand on. He is alone in his freedom. Guilt \nis a function of fear, as Rank said.\nIt is no surprise, then, that Freud would be particularly sensitive \nto the idea of father-murder. We can imagine that father-murder \nwould be a complex symbol for him, comprising the heavy guilt \nof standing alone in his vulnerability, an attack on his identity as \na father, on the psychoanalytic movement as his causa-sui vehicle, \nand thus on his immortality. In a word, father-murder would mean \nhis own insignificance as a creature. It is just such an interpretation \nthat the fainting episodes point to. The years around 1912 were the \ntime when the future of the psychoanalytic movement crystallized \nas a problem. Freud was looking for an heir, and it was Jung who \nwas to be the “son” whom he had proudly chosen as his spiritual \nsuccessor and who would assure the success and continuation of \npsychoanalysis. Freud literally burdened Jung with his hopes and\n\f\nexpectations, so prominent was his place in Freuds life-plan.36 \nThus we can understand how completely logical it is that Jung's \ndefection from the movement would—all by itself—invoke the \ncomplex symbol of father-murder and stand for the death of \nFreud.37\nNo wonder that on the occasion of the first fainting Freud ac­\ncused Jung of “death-wishes” toward him and that Jung felt him­\nself entirely innocent of any such wishes. He says that he “was \nmore than surprised by this interpretation.”38 To him these were \nfantasies of Freuds, but fantasies of great intensity, “so strong that, \nobviously, they could cause him to faint.” Of the second occasion \nJung says that the whole atmosphere was very tense; whatever \nother causes may have contributed to Freuds fainting, the fantasy \nof father-murder was evidently again involved. In fact, the at­\nmosphere of rivalry hovered over the whole luncheon meeting. It \nwas a strategy meeting loaded with possibilities of dissention in \nthe psychoanalytic ranks. Jones communicated this in his version of \nthe 1912 faintings:\n... as we were finishing luncheon . . . [Freud] began reproaching the \ntwo Swiss, Jung, and Riklin, for writing articles expounding psycho­\nanalysis in the Swiss periodicals without mentioning his name. Jung re­\nplied that they had thought it unnecessary to do so, it being so well \nknown, but Freud had sensed already the first signs of the dissension \nthat was to follow a year later. He persisted, and I remember thinking \nhe was taking the matter rather personally. Suddenly, to our consterna­\ntion, he fell on the floor in a dead faint.39\nJung is hardly convincing in his graceful denials of rivalry with \nFreud, in his disingenuous explanations for why the Swiss were \nomitting to mention Freuds name. Even in his denial of harboring \ndeath-wishes toward Freud, he makes plain his competitiveness.\nWhy should I want him to die? I had come to learn. He was not stand­\ning in my way; he was in Vienna, I was in Zurich.40\nOn the one hand he admits that he is in a learning relationship to \nFreud the master; on the other he attempts to establish that he \nstands on his own, on equal footing. Freud could surely sense the\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 111\n\f\nthreat to his priority, which would actually be an act of filial treason \nto him.41 Jung was drifting away from the fold, threatening a rivalry \nwith the Swiss branch of psychoanalysis. What would happen to \nthe “father” then, and all he stood for? The fact is that Freud \nfainted at the precise moment that Jung made light of the matter of \npriorities in the founding of a new Egyptian religion by Amenophis \nIV. This threatened Freuds whole lifes missionary work. Freud \nhad a picture of the Sphinx and the pyramids prominently dis­\nplayed in his consulting room, his innermost sanctum. This was \nfor him no romantic image or archaeological hobby. Egypt stood \nfor the whole mysterious and dark past of mankind that psycho­\nanalysis was chosen to decipher.42 There is, Roazen says, a direct as­\nsociation between twentieth-century psychoanalysis and ancient \nEgyptology, between Amenophis' scratching out his father's name \non the steles and Jung’s doing the same from Zurich. Jung was at­\ntacking Freud's immortality.\nBut this attack was in Freud’s eyes and not necessarily in Jung's. \nThat he talked on about the peat-bog corpses at the time of the \nfirst fainting could well reflect existential anxieties, pure and simple. \nJung was fascinated by the idea of death. We can well imagine \nthe younger Jung, also anxious about the voyage to America, linger­\ning on the problem of bodies in the presence of a man he looked \nup to because he wanted to broach something that fascinated him \nto a thinker who might ruminate with him, perhaps add his own \ninsight into the mystery of bodies, death, and destiny. On the other \nhand, Erich Fromm (who is hardly a fan of Jung's) has diagnosed \nhim as a necrophilous character. On the basis of one of Jung's \ndreams at the time of his break with Freud, Fromm believes that \nJung did have unconscious death-wishes toward Freud.43\nYet all this speculation is beside the point, because we are talking \nabout Freud’s own perceptions and problems. From this point of \nview the significant thing about the occasion of the first fainting \nis that the talk of mummies came up because of Jung's confusion \nabout the corpses. Freud's anxieties on both occasions are thereby \ntied to the same subjects of Egypt and the effacing of the father. \nAlso, it is important to note that on this historic voyage Jung had \nbeen invited for his own work and not necessarily because of his \nconnection with Freud; he was literally and openly a competitor.\n\f\nThe Interpretations of Jones and Freud\nWe get even further “inside” the problem of Freuds perceptions \nwhen we look at his own attempts to understand what had hap­\npened to him. Jones tells a somewhat different story of the occasion \nof the first fainting than did Jung. Jones says that what character­\nized the 1909 meeting was that Freud, after some argument, per­\nsuaded Jung to drink wine during the luncheon party and so broke \nJung's fanatical abstinence. It was “just after that” that Freud fell \ndown in a faint.44 At the later 1912 meeting, a similar thing hap­\npened. There had been some strain between Jung and Freud, and \nafter a “good fatherly lecture” Jung became “extremely contrite, \naccepted all the criticisms” of Freud, and “promised to reform.” \nFreud was in very high spirits, having won Jung round again. Jones \nconcludes that what characterized both meetings was that Freud \nhad won a victory over Jung.45\nWhat relationship does victory have to fainting? Only with the \ngenius of Freud's own theory can such a relationship be meaning­\nfully explained. As we saw in Chapter Four, it was Freud who dis­\ncovered the idea of being “wrecked by success”: that when a person \nachieves the truly superlative, it is often felt as an intolerable bur­\nden because it means that he has won out in competition with the \nfather, having excelled him. No wonder, then, that when Freud \nhimself later analyzed the fainting attacks, he could lean on his own \ndiscovery with a probing and ruthless honesty. He explained that as \na child he had often wished the death of his baby brother Julius, \nand when Julius did die when Freud was a year and seven months \nold, it left Freud with a terrible sense of guilt. Jones comments:\nIt would therefore seem that Freud was himself a mild case of the type \nhe described as “those who are wrecked by success,” in this case the \nsuccess of defeating an opponent [Jung]—the earliest example of which \nwas his successful death-wish against his little brother Julius. One thinks \nin this connection of the curious attack of obfuscation Freud suffered on \nthe Acropolis in 1904, one which, when he was eighty-one years old, he \nanalyzed and traced to his having gratified the forbidden wish to excel \nhis father. In fact Freud himself mentioned the resemblance between that \nexperience and the type of reaction we are considering.46\nThe Problem of Freud’s Character, Noch Einmal 113\n\f\n114 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nIn other words, all victories over a rival, including his own father, \nreawaken the guilt of victory and trigger the reaction of being un­\nable to bear it. We have to understand what \"victory” means in \nFreuds cosmology in order to get the impact of the anxiety and \nunderstand why one would faint. It is explained by the dynamics \nof the classic Oedipus complex. The victory “prize” is of course the \nmother whom the boy covets, and to win out against the father \nmeans to do away with him. If the child loses, the vengeance will \nbe terrible; and if he wins, the guilt is naturally overwhelming.\nNow the classic Oedipus complex does undoubtedly explain some \ncases of fear of victory; but Freud himself later abandoned the \nstrictly sexual dynamics of the problem, at least in his own case. He \nfrankly admitted toward the end of his life that his reluctance to \nsurpass his father was based on a feeling of “piety” for him.47 This \nwas the meaning of the attack on the Acropolis that Jones mentions. \nToday, as some writers are arguing, we would guess that the word \n“piety” might be a euphemism for other feelings that Freud had \ntoward his father: that he was really troubled by the weakness \nof his father, which cast a shadow on his own strength, and that for \nthat reason he felt exposed and anxious when he thought about his \nown success.\nWe are thus already on a broader and more existential ground \nin explaining the overwhelmingness of victory. Already two genera­\ntions of students have raised their eyebrows over how a 19-month- \nold Freud could be so acutely analytic about his experience that he \ncould reproach himself that his jealousy and evil wishes resulted in \nbis brother Julius's death. Even Freud himself discounted this level \nof awareness in his own theoretical work: he said that it was almost \nimpossible for a child that young to be jealous of a newcomer. \nJones, who recorded all this, evidently cannot make sense out of it.48\nJones says that Freuds own “wrecked-by-success” analysis of his \nfainting is confirmed by the fact that on the occasion of each faint­\ning there was an argumentative discussion on the topic of death- \nwishes. This is perfectly true, but not in the precise way that Freud \nwanted to show it, as tied to the strength of victory. Very likely \nFreud is making a mistake that he often makes, of trying to peg \ndown too precisely what is actually part of a complex symbol and \na much larger problem. I mean of course the sense of the over­\n\f\nwhelmingness of experience, of being carried too far off one’s home \nbase, of not having the power to support the superlative. That sense \nis what characterizes both fainting incidents, in addition to the \nspecific presence of Jung. It is reasonable to broaden the burden \nplaced on Freud beyond that of a reaction to Jung alone. After all, \nhe supported on his shoulders one of the great iconoclastic move­\nments of human thought, against all competition, all hostility, all \ndenigration, all the other more “spiritual” (“occult”) meanings that \nmankind held so sacred, all the other minds who thought such \nsublime thoughts, insisted on such widely-held truths, enjoyed so \nmuch support and acclaim throughout the ages. His organism in its \ndeepest layers is well entitled to feel impossibly burdened by such \na weight and to sink beneath it in pleasureful oblivion. Would we \ndare to imagine that one can support all this superordinacy easily, \nwithout superhuman powers on which to lean? How to take a stance \ntoward all this impersonal and historical, as well as personal, con­\ncrete, and physical transcendence: the pyramids, the peat-bog \ncorpses, ones own new religion? It is as though ones whole or­\nganism were to declare: “I can’t bear it, I haven’t the strength to \nstand up to it.” Admittedly, the strong and large figure of Jung, an \noriginal thinker, standing independently and even arguing and \nopposing Freud, adds to all this; but Jung’s concrete presence is \nonly one aspect of a general power problem. In this sense, even to \nfinally win out against Jung was for Freud to put the whole weight \nof the psychoanalytic movement squarely on his own shoulders. We \ncan see how apt the “wrecked-by-success” insight is, though not \naccording to the specific dynamics that Freud had in mind.\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 115\nThe Emotional Ambivalence of Causa Sui\nThe crux of our whole discussion is contained in one confession \nof Freud’s to Karl Abraham: that helplessness was one of the two \nthings that he always hated most.49 (The other was poverty—be­\ncause it means helplessness.) Freud hated helplessness and fought \nagainst it, and the emotional feeling of utter helplessness in the face \nof experience was too much for him to stand. It gave full play to the\n\f\nunderside of dependency that he tried to control. This kind of con­\ntinued self-shaping by a man thrust into Freud’s leadership posi­\ntion must have consumed enormous amounts of energy. No wonder \nthat, as Freud was coming to after his second fainting, he was heard \nto say: “How sweet it must be to die.”50 And there is no reason to \ndoubt Jung’s report of the occasion, which is all of a piece:\nAs I was carrying him, he half came to, and I shall never forget the look \nhe cast at me as if I were his father.51\nHow sweet it must be to let go of the colossal burden of a self- \ndominating, self-forming life, to relax one’s grip on one’s own center, \nand to yield passively to a superordinate power and authority— \nand what joy in such yielding: the comfort, the trust, the relief in \none’s chest and shoulders, the lightness in one’s heart, the sense of \nbeing sustained by something larger, less fallible. With his own \ndistinctive problems, man is the only animal who can often willingly \nembrace the deep sleep of death, even while knowing that it means \noblivion.\nBut there is the ambivalence that Freud—like all of us—was \ncaught in. To melt oneself trustingly into the father, or the father- \nsubstitute, or even the Great Father in the sky, is to abandon the \ncausa-sui project, the attempt to be father of oneself. And if you \nabandon that you are diminished, your destiny is no longer your \nown; you are the eternal child making your way in the world of \nthe elders. And what kind of world is that, if you are trying to \nbring into it something of your own, something distinctively new, \nworld-historical, and revolutionary? That is why Freud had to fight \nagainst yielding—he risked effacing his whole identity. He was \nspinning his own web; how could he suspend himself in someone \nelse’s? It was Rank more than anyone who understood the problem \nof mere mortals who are saddled with the works of genius: Where \nare they to get the support for their own daring and overshadow­\ning creations? We will see Rank’s views in the next chapter; here \nit is already obvious that Freud chose to pursue his causa-sui \nproject by using his own work and his own organization—the psy­\nchoanalytic movement—as a mirror to reflect power back upon him­\nself. We said earlier that the causa-sui project is a lie that must take\nIl6 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nits toll; now we can understand that this toll is an emotional one \nthat must always carry both the temptation to admit helpless de­\npendence and the fight against that admission. One lives with a \ncertain amount of tight-lipped determination.!\nThere is further support for this view in Freud’s fifteen-year re­\nlationship with Fliess. Brome is of the opinion that this relationship \nwas an emotional one more powerful than any previous biographer \nhas acknowledged; and he cites Freud’s own admissions of his very \nprofound and “obscure” feelings in relation to Fliess. It is more than \na coincidence, then, that years earlier Freud had suffered symptoms \nin relationship to Fliess similar to those he suffered toward Jung— \nand in the very same room of the same hotel as at the 1912 meet­\ning. At that earlier time the symptoms were not so intense, and they \nwere directed not toward a strong opposing figure but toward an \nailing Fliess. When Freud analyzed this he said that “there is some \npiece of unruly homosexual feeling at the root of the matter.” Jones \nreports that Freud several times remarked on the “feminine side of \nhis nature.”52\nEven though Freud’s self-analytic honesty was unusual, we still \nhave to be skeptical about it. It is possible for any man to have \nspecific homosexual urges, and Freud need be no exception. Still, \nknowing Freud’s lifelong tendency to reduce vaguely anxious feel­\nings to specific sexual motivations, we are entitled to assume that \nhis “unruly” urges could just as well have represented the am­\nbivalence of dependency needs. Jones himself has honestly averaged \nthe problem of homosexuality into his appraisal of Freud’s char­\nacter, and I think gave it its proper weight. Jones says that this was \npart of the underside of dependency in Freud, a dependency that \nled him astray in some ways, for example, in his tendency to over­\nestimate certain people—Breuer, especially Fliess, and also Jung. \nJones goes so far as to say that this side of Freud stemmed from \n\"some impairment of self-confidence.”53 Certainly Freud loathed\n$ Erich Fromm, in his important discussion of Freud’s character, also fixes \non helplessness and dependency as the underside of Freud and so also confirms \nJones. But Fromm seems to me to accent it too much as an ambivalent reflex \nof Freud’s childhood relationship to his mother, whereas I am seeing it more as \na universal phenomenon reacting to Freud’s distinctive heroic ambition and \nburdens.

A part of homo­\nsexual cathexis has been withdrawn and made use of to enlarge my ego.54\nThe ego is the thing; it alone gives self-governance, the ability to \nhave a certain freedom of action and choice, to shape one s own \ndestiny as much as possible. Today we generally see homosexuality \nas a broad problem of ineptness, vague identity, passivity, help­\nlessness—all in all, an inability to take a powerful stance toward \nlife. In this sense, Jones would be right to talk about an impairment \nof self-confidence in Freud, as he showed it both toward the strong \nfigure of Jung and the ailing one of Fliess. In both cases it is ones \nown strength that is threatened with an added burden.\nOn the other hand, our modern understanding of homosexuality \ngoes to an even deeper level of the problem—to the level of im­\nmortality and heroism that we have already discussed in relation to \nFreud and to genius in general.

It is as though he \nreasons: “I do not exist to be used as an instrument of physical pro­\ncreation in the interests of the race; my individuality is so total and \nintegral that I include my body in my causa-sui project.” And so, the \ngenius can try to procreate himself spiritually through a linkage \nwith gifted young men, to create them in his own image, and to \npass the spirit of his genius on to them.

    "raw_text": "debasing. The woman is already a threat to the man in his physical­\nness; it is only a small step to bypass sexual intercourse with her; in \nthat way one keeps one’s carefully girded center from dispersing \nand being undermined by ambiguous meanings. Most men are con­\ntent to keep their meanings firmly in hand by refraining from extra­\nmarital infidelity; but one can narcissistically harbor his meanings \neven more by refraining from “heterosexual infidelity,” so to speak.\nFrom this point of view, when Freud talked about “the feminine \nlide of his nature” he could just as well have been speaking from \nthe strength of his ego rather than its weakness, from his own \nSingle-minded determination to engineer his own immortality. It \nis common knowledge that sexual relations between Freud and his \nwife came to an end around the age of forty-one and that he was \nStrictly monogamous so far as we know. This behavior would be \nall of a piece with his causa-sui project: the narcissistic self-inflation \nthat denies dependency on the female body and on one’s species- \ngiven role and the control and harboring of the power and meaning \nof one’s individuality. As Roazen points out, in Freud’s own words \nhe saw his hero as:\n... a man whose sexual need and activity were exceptionally reduced, \nas if a higher aspiration had raised him above the common animal need \nof mankind.55\nEvidently Freud poured his whole passion into the psychoanalytic \nmovement and his own immortality. They were his “higher aspira­\ntion,” which could also reasonably include a spiritual homosexuality \nthat offered no threat as an “animal need.”\nThe Problem of Freuds Character, Noch Einmal 119\nThe Conceptual Ambivalence of Causa Sui\nSo far we have been talking about emotional ambivalence, but \nthere is also a conceptual side to the matter. It is one thing to \nface up to and admit an emotional reaction to the experience of \nfading away; it is still another thing to justify that fading. Freud \ncould admit dependency and helplessness, but how give his own\n\f\n120 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ndeath any meaning? He either had to justify it from within his \ncausa-sui project, the psychoanalytic movement, or from somewhere \noutside that project. Here is the ambivalence of causa sui on a con­\nceptual level: how can one trust any meanings that are not man- \nmade? These are the only meanings that we securely know; nature \nseems unconcerned, even viciously antagonistic to human meanings; \nand we fight by trying to bring our own dependable meanings into \nthe world. But human meanings are fragile, ephemeral: they are \nconstantly being discredited by historical events and natural ca­\nlamities. One Hitler can efface centuries of scientific and religious \nmeanings; one earthquake can negate a million times the meaning \nof a personal life. Mankind has reacted by trying to secure human \nmeanings from beyond. Man’s best efforts seem utterly fallible with­\nout appeal to something higher for justification, some conceptual \nsupport for the meaning of one’s life from a transcendental dimen­\nsion of some kind. As this belief has to absorb man’s basic terror, \nit cannot be merely abstract but must be rooted in the emotions, \nin an inner feeling that one is secure in something stronger, larger, \nmore important than ones own strength and life. It is as though \none were to say: “My life pulse ebbs, I fade away into oblivion, but \n“God” (or “It”) remains, even grows more glorious with and \nthrough my living sacrifice.” At least, this feeling is belief at its \nmost effective for the individual.\nThe problem of how far a life has to reach to earn secure heroic \nmeaning obviously bothered Freud very much. According to psy­\nchoanalytic theory, the child meets the terror of life and aloneness \nfirst by asserting his own omnipotence and then by using the cul­\ntural morality as the vehicle for his immortality. By the time we \ngrow up, this confident, delegated immortality becomes a major de­\nfense in the service of the equanimity of our organism in the face \nof danger. One of the main reasons that it is so easy to march men \noff to war is that deep down each of them feels sorry for the man \nnext to him who will die. Each protects himself in his fantasy until \nthe shock that he is bleeding. It is logical that if you are one of the \nfew who admits the anxiety of death, then you must question the \nfantasy of immortality, which is exactly the experience of Freud. \nZilboorg affirms that the problem troubled Freud all his life. He \nyearned for fame, anticipated it, hoped that through it he could\n\f\n^  The Problem of Freud's Character, Noch Einmal 121\nt\nI create his own immortality: “Immortality means being loved bv \njf many anonymous people.” This definition is the Enlightenment view \nof immortality: living in the esteem of men yet unborn, for the\nV  works that you have contributed to their life and betterment.\nBut it is an entirely “this-worldly” immortality—there’s the rub. It \nmust have rubbed Freud very gratingly. His views on immortality \nwere charged with a “severe ambivalence, even multivalence.”50 \nEven early in life he told his fiancee that he had destroyed all the \nletters he had received, adding ironically and triumphantly that his \nfuture biographers would be hard put to find data about him after \nhe had gone from this earth. Later in life he said a similar thing \nabout his letters to Fliess: if he had gotten hold of them instead of \n’ one of his disciples, he would have destroyed them rather than \nletting “so-called posterity” have them. Zilboorg seems to think that \nthis oscillation between desire for immortality and scorn for it re­\nflects Freud’s unfortunate habit of forming polarities in his thought; \nbut to me it seems like more magical toying with reality: As you \nfear that life in this dimension may not count, may not have any \nreal meaning, you relieve your anxiety by being especially scornful \nof the very thing that you wish for most, while underneath your \nwriting desk you have your fingers crossed.\nOn the one hand you make psychoanalysis your private religion, \n' your own royal road to immortality; on the other you are unique \nand isolated enough to question the whole career of man on this \n(  planet. At the same time you cannot abandon the project of your \nOwji creation of immortality, because the religious promise of im­\nmortality is a pure illusion, fit for children and for the credulous \nT  , man in the street. Freud was in this terrible bind; as he confessed \n' to the Reverend Oskar Pfister:\nVI\n■  ’ I can imagine that several million years ago in the Triassic age all the \n, 1 g re a t -odons and -therias were very proud of the development of the \n^ Saurian race and looked forward to heaven knows what magnificent \ns'; future for themselves. And then, with the exception of the wretched \nI Crocodile, they all died out. You will object that . . . man is equipped \n-1' W ith  mind, which gives him the right to think about and believe in his \n^  future. Now there is certainly something special about mind, so little is \n' known about it and its relation to nature. I personally have a vast respect \n,  f o r  mind, but has nature? Mind is only a little bit of nature, the rest of\n\f\n1\nwhich seems to be able to get along very well without it. Will it really \nallow itself to be influenced to any great extent by regard for mind?\nEnviable he who can feel more confident about that than I.57\nIt is hard for a man to work steadfastly when his work can mean \nno more than the digestive noises, wind-breakings, and cries of \ndinosaurs—noises now silenced forever. Or perhaps one works all \nthe harder to defy the callous unconcern of nature; in that way one \nmight even compel her to defer to the products of mysterious mind, \nby making words and thoughts an unshakable monument to mans \nhonesty about his condition. This is what makes man strong and \ntrue—that he defies the illusory comforts of religion. Human illu­\nsions prove that men do not deserve any better than oblivion. So \nFreud must have reasoned as he made psychoanalysis the com­\npetitor of religion. Psychoanalytic science would establish the true \nfacts of the moral world and would reform it—if anything could. \nWe see why psychoanalysis itself was a religion for Freud, as so \nmany authoritative thinkers from Jung and Rank to Zilboorg and \nRieff have remarked.\nAll this can be put another way: that Freud set out to defy \nnature by redoubling efforts to make true the lie of causa sui. Zil­\nboorg, in his penetrating assessment of Freud and religion, closed \non these remarks:\nEver since man started his so-called “conquest of nature,” he has tried to \nfancy himself the conqueror of the universe. In order to assure himself \nof the mastery of a conqueror, he grabbed the trophy (nature, universe). \nHe had to feel that the Maker of the trophy was annihilated, or his own \nfantasied sovereignty over the universe would be endangered. It is this \ntrend that is reflected in Freud’s unwillingness to accept religious faith \nin its true meaning. ... It is no surprise, therefore, to find that in the \nfield of human psychology a man, no matter how great—a man like \nFreud—had constantly before him the vision of a man who is always un­\nhappy, helpless, anxious, bitter, looking into nothingness with fright, and \nturning away from “so-called posterity” in anticipatory . . . disgust.58\nZilboorg says that Freud was driven into a rigid, almost solipsistic \nintellectual attitude by “his need to rid himself of any suspicion \nof intellectual dependence on others or spiritual dependence on a \npersonal God.”59 The lie of causa sui becomes especially driven be­\n122 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\ncause of what one will not or cannot acknowledge; then the very \ntruth with which one seeks to defy nature suffers.\nJung, who would agree with Zilboorg, offers what to me seems \nthe briefest and most apt summary of Freud's characterological life- \nproblem:\nFreud never asked himself why he was compelled to talk continually of \nsex, why this idea had taken such possession of him. He remained un­\naware that his “monotony of interpretation” expressed a flight from him­\nself, or from that other side of him which might perhaps be called \nmystical. So long as he refused to acknowledge that side, he could never \nbe reconciled with himself. . . .\nThere was nothing to be done about this one-sidedness of Freuds. \nPerhaps some inner experience of his own might have opened his eyes. \n... He remained the victim of the one aspect he could recognize, and \nfor that reason I see him as a tragic figure; for he was a great man, and \nwhat is more, a man in the grip of his daimon.60\nWhat, actually, does it mean to be a tragic figure firmly in the \ngrip of ones daimon? It means to possess great talent, to relentlessly \npursue the expression of that talent through the unswerving affirma­\ntion of the causa-sui project that alone gives it birth and form. One \nis consumed by what he must do to express his gift. The passion of \nhis character becomes inseparable from his dogma. Jung says the \nsame thing beautifully when he concludes that Freud “must himself \nbe so profoundly affected by the power of Eros that he actually \nwished to elevate it into a dogma . . . like a religious numen.”61 \nEros is precisely the natural energy of the child’s organism that will \nnot let him rest, that keeps propelling him forward in a driven way \nwhile he fashions the lie of his character—which ironically permits \nthat very drivenness to continue, but now under the illusion of self- \ncontrol.\nConclusion\nNow as we draw the circle on the very beginning of our discus­\nsion of Freud, we can see that his two great reluctances, as we have \ncalled them, are related, and in fact merge into one.

Men show the “same \nattachment to the physician, the same overestimation of his qualities, \nthe same adoption of his interest, the same jealousy against all those \nconnected with him/’6 Freud saw that this was an uncanny phe­\nnomenon, and in order to explain it he called it “transference.” The \npatient transfers the feelings he had towards his parents as a child \nto the person of the physician. He blows the physician up larger \nthan life just as the child sees the parents. He becomes as de­\npendent on him, draws protection and power from him just as the \nchild merges his destiny with* the parents, and so on. In the trans­\nference we see the grown person as a child at heart, a child who \ndistorts the world to relieve his helplessness and fears, who sees \nthings as he wishes them to be for his own safety, who acts auto­\nmatically and uncritically, just as he did in the pre-Oedipal period.7\nFreud saw that transference wasjust another form of the basic \nhuman suggestibility that makes hygnosis possible. It was the same \npassive surrender to superior power,8 and in This lay its real un­\ncanniness. What, after all, is more “mysterious” than hypnosis, the \nsight of adults falling into instant stupors and obeying like autom­\natons the commands of a stranger? It seems like some truly super­\nnatural power at work, as if some person really did possess a mana \nthat could enmesh others in a spell. However, it seemed that way \nonly because man ignored the slavishness in his own soul. He \nwanted to believe that if he lost his will it was because of someone \nelse. He wouldn’t admit that this loss of will was something that he \nhimself carried around as a secret yearning, a readiness to respond \nto someone’s voice and the snap of his fingers. Hypnosis was a \nmystery only as long as man did not admit his own unconscious \nmotives. It baffled us because we denied what was basic in our \nnature. Perhaps we could even say that men were all too willingly \nmystified by hypnosis because they had to deny the big lie upon \nwhich their whole conscious lives were based: the lie of self-suf­\nficiency, of free self-determination, of independent judgment and \nchoice. The continuing vogue of vampire movies may be a clue to \nhow close to the surface our repressed fears are: the anxiety of \nlosing control, of coming completely under someone’s spell, of not \nreally being in command of ourselves. One intense look, one \nmysterious song, and our lives may be lost forever.\n\f\nAll this was brought out beautifully by Ferenczi in 1909, in a \nbasic essay that has not been much improved upon in a half-century \nof psychoanalytic work.9* Ferenczi pointed out how important it \nwas for the hypnotist to be an imposing person, of high social rank, \nwith a self-confident manner. When he gave his commands the \npatient would sometimes go under as if struck by “coup de foudre” \nThere was nothing to do but obey, as by his imposing, authoritarian \nfigure the hypnotist took the place of the parents. He knew “just \nthose ways of frightening and being tender, the efficacy of which \nhas been proved for thousands of years in the relations of parent \nto child.”10 We see the same technique used by revivalists as they \nalternatingly harangue their audiences with a shrieking voice and \nthen immediately soothe them with a soft one. With a heart-rending \nscream of agony and ecstasy one throws himself at the revivalist’s \nfeet to be saved.\nAs the highest ambition of the child is to obey the all-powerful \nparent, to believe in him, and to imitate him, what is more natural \nthan an instant, imaginary return to childhood via the hypnotic \ntrance? The explanation of the ease of hypnosis, said Ferenczi, is \nthat “In our innermost soul we are still children, and we remain \nso throughout life.”11 And so, in one theoretical sweep Ferenczi\n0 I am aware of the enormous literature on transference and the extensions, \nmodifications, and debates raging around it; but it would go far beyond my \npurposes to attempt to reflect the technical literature here. We will see further \non some of the crucial ways in which our understanding of transference goes \nbeyond Freud and Ferenczi. But I am not sure that the technical arguments \namong psychoanalysts, on the precise nature of transference, hypnosis, and the \nlike add much to their basic understanding of the phenomenon. Trigant Bur­\nrow’s early attempt to make transference entirely a problem of social learning \nseems to me a clear fallacy, as we will see further on. (Trigant Burrow, “The \nProblem of the Transference/’ British Journal of Medical Psychology, 1927, \nvol. 7, pp. 193-202) Freud seems to me still correct to discount physiological \ntheories of induction into the hypnotic trance, in spite of Kubie and Margolin’s \nlater argument (cf. Freud, Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, \n1922 (New York: Bantam Books edition, i960), p. 74; and L. S. Kubie and \nSydney Margolin, “The Process of Hypnotism and the Nature of the Hypnotic \nState,” American Journal of Psychiatry, 1944, vol. 180, pp. 611-622); cf. also \nMerton M. Gill and Margaret Brenman, Hypnosis and Related States: Psycho­\nanalytic Studies in Regression (New York: Science Editions, 1959), pp. 143, \n*96-7 • The area where the most meaningful revision of the theory of the \ntransference has been made is, of course, its use and interpretation in therapy; \nand this is clearly outside my discussion.\n130 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

    "raw_text": "could destroy the mystery of hypnosis by showing that the subject \ncarries in himself the predisposition to it:\n. . . there is no such thing as a “hypnotising,” a “giving of ideas” in the \nsense of psychical incorporating of something quite foreign from with- \n, out, but only procedures that are able to set going unconscious, pre­\nexisting, auto-suggestive mechanisms. . . . According to this conception, \nthe application of suggestion and hypnosis consists in the deliberate \nestablishment of conditions under which the tendency to blind belief and \nuncritical obedience present in everyone, but usually kept repressed . . . \nmay unconsciously be transferred to the person hypnotising or sug­\ngesting.12\nI am lingering on Ferenczi’s unlocking of the secret of hypnosis \nfor a very important reason. By discovering a universal predisposi­\ntion at the heart of man, Freudian psychology itself gained the key \nto a universal underlying historical psychology. As not everyone \nundergoes formal hypnosis, most people can hide and disguise their \ninner urge to merge themselves with power figures. But the pre­\ndisposition to hypnosis is the same one that gives rise to trans- \n‘i ference, and no one is immune to that, no one can argue away the \n' manifestations of transference in everyday human affairs. It is not \nvisible on the surface: adults walk around looking quite indepen­\ndent; they play the role of parent themselves and seem quite grown \nl Up—and sa they are. They couldn't function if they still carried \nwith them the childhood feeling of awe for their parents, the \nf tendency to obey them automatically and uncritically. But, says \n’ Ferenczi, although these things normally disappear, “the need to be\nI . Subject to someone remains; only the part of the father is trans-\nII  ferred to teachers, superiors, impressive personalities; the submissive \nloyalty to rulers that is so wide-spread is also a transference of this \nsort.”13\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 131\nFreud's Great Work on Group Psychology\nWith a theoretical background that unlocked the problem of \nhypnosis and that discovered the universal mechanism of the trans­\nference, Freud was almost obliged to provide the best insights ever\n\f\n132 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ninto the psychology of leadership; and so he wrote his great work \nGroup Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, a book of fewer \nthan 100 pages that in my opinion is probably the single most \npotentially liberating tract that has ever been fashioned by man. In \nhis later years Freud wrote a few books that reflected personal and \nideological preferences; but Group Psychology was a serious \nscientific work that consciously placed itself in a long tradition. \nEarly theorists of group psychology had tried to explain why men \nwere so sheeplike when they functioned in groups. They developed \nideas like “mental contagion” and “herd instinct/’ which became \nvery popular. But as Freud was quick to see, these ideas never \nreally did explain what men did with their judgment and common \nsense when they got caught up in groups. Freud saw right away \nwhat they did with it: they simply became dependent children \nagain, blindly following the inner voice of their parents, which now \ncame to them under the hypnotic spell of the leader. They \nabandoned their egos to his, identified with his power, tried to \nfunction with him as an ideal.\nIt is not so much that man is a herd animal, said Freud, but that \nhe is a horde animal led by a chief.14 It is this alone that can ex­\nplain the “uncanny and coercive characteristics of group forma­\ntions.” The chief is a “dangerous personality, toward whom only a \npassive-masochistic attitude is possible, to whom one’s will has to \nbe surrendered,—while to be alone with him, ‘to look him in the \nface,’ appears a hazardous enterprise.” This alone, says Freud, ex­\nplains the “paralysis” that exists in the link between a person with \ninferior power to one of superior power. Man has “an extreme pas­\nsion for authority” and “wishes to be governed by unrestricted \nforce.”15 It is this trait that the leader hypnotically embodies in his \nown masterful person. Or as Fenichel later put it, people have a \n“longing for being hypnotized” precisely because they want to get \nback to the magical protection, the participation in omnipotence, \nthe “oceanic feeling” that they enjoyed when they were loved and \nprotected by their parents.16 And so, as Freud argues, it is not that \ngroups bring out anything new in people; it is just that they satisfy \nthe deep-seated erotic longings that people constantly carry around \nunconsciously. For Freud, this was the life force that held groups \ntogether. It functioned as a kind of psychic cement that locked\n\f\npeople into mutual and mindless interdependence: the magnetic \npowers of the leader, reciprocated by the guilty delegation of every­\none's will to him.\nNo one who honestly remembers how hazardous it could be to \nlook certain people in the face or how blissful to bask trustingly \nin the glow of another's power can accuse Freud of psychoanalytic \nrhetoric. By explaining the precise power that held groups together \nFreud could also show why groups did not fear danger. The mem­\nbers do not feel that they are alone with their own smallness and \nhelplessness, as they have the powers of the hero-leader with whom \nthey are identified. Natural narcissism—the feeling that the person \nnext to you will die, but not you—is reinforced by trusting de­\npendence on the leader’s power. No wonder that hundreds of thou­\nsands of men marched up from trenches in the face of blistering \ngunfire in World War I. They were partially self-hypnotised, so to \nspeak. No wonder men imagine victories against impossible odds: \ndon't they have the omnipotent powers of the parental figure? Why \nare groups so blind and stupid?—men have always asked. Because \nthey demand illusions, answered Freud, they “constantly give what \nis unreal precedence over what is real.”17 And we know why. The j \nreal world is simply too terrible to admit; it tells man that he is a \nsmall, trembling animal who will decay and die. Illusion changes \\ \nall this, makes man seem important, vital to the universe, immortal 1 \nin some way. Who transmits this illusion, if not the parents by ‘ \nimparting the macro-lie of the cultural causa sui? The masses look \nto the leaders to give them just the untruth that they need; the \nleader continues the illusions that triumph over the castration \ncomplex and magnifies them into a truly heroic victory. Further­\nmore, he makes possible a new experience, the expression of for­\nbidden impulses, secret wishes, and fantasies. In group behavior \nanything goes because the leader okays it.18 It is like being an \nomnipotent infant again, encouraged by the parent to indulge one­\nself plentifully, or like being in psychoanalytic therapy where the \nanalyst doesn't censure you for anything you feel or think. In the \ngroup each man seems an omnipotent hero who can give full vent \nto his appetites under the approving eye of the father. And so we \nunderstand the terrifying sadism of group activity.\nThus Freud's great work on group psychology, on the dynamics\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 133\n\f\n134 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nof blind obedience, illusion, communal sadism. In recent writings \nErich Fromm especially has seen the durable value of Freud’s in­\nsights, as part of a developing and continuing critique of human \nviciousness and blindness. From his early work Escape from Free­\ndom to his recent The Heart of Man, Fromm has developed Freud’s \nviews on the need for a magic helper. He has kept alive Freud's \nbasic insight into narcissism as the primary characteristic of man: \nhow it inflates one with the importance of his own life and makes \nfor the devaluation of others’ lives; how it helps to draw sharp lines \nbetween “those who are like me or belong to me” and those who are \n“outsiders and aliens.” Fromm has insisted, too, on the importance \nof what he calls “incestuous symbiosis”: the fear of emerging out \nof the family and into the world on one’s own responsibility and \npowers; the desire to keep oneself tucked into a larger source of \npower. It is these things that make for the mystique of “group,” \n“nation,” “blood,” “mother- or fatherland,” and the like. These feel­\nings are embedded in one’s earliest experiences of comfortable \nmerger with the mother. As Fromm put it, they keep one “in the \nprison of the motherly racial-national-religious fixation.”19 Fromm \nis exciting reading, and there is no point in my repeating or de­\nveloping what he has already so well said. One has to go directly \nto him and study how compelling are these insights, how well they \ncontinue what is essential in Freud and apply it to present-day prob­\nlem^ of.jlavishness, viciousness, and continuing political madness.\n^TKis, it seems to m fIs the authentic line of cumulative critical \nthought on the human condition. The astonishing thing is that this \ncentral line of work on the problem of freedom since the Enlighten­\nment occupies so little of the concern and ongoing activity of \nscientists. It should form the largest body of theoretical and empir­\nical work in the human sciences, if these sciences are to have any \nhuman meaning.\nDevelopments Beyond Freud\nToday we do not accept uncritically all of Freud’s arguments on \ngroup dynamics or consider them necessarily complete.

    "raw_text": "phylogenetic myth of the “primal horde,’* Freud's attempt to re­\nconstruct the earliest beginnings of society, when proto-men—like \nbaboons—lived under the tyrannical rule of a dominant male. For \nFreud this craving of people for the strong personality, their awe \nand fear of him, remained the model for the basic functioning of \nall groups. It was Redl, in his important essay, who showed \nthat Freuds attempt to explain everything by the “strong per­\nsonality” was not true to fact. Redl, who studied many different \nkinds of groups, found that domination by a strong personality \noccurred in some of them, but not all.20 But he did find that in all \ngroups there was what he called a “central person” who held the \ngroup together due to certain of his qualities. This shift of emphasis \nis slight and leaves Freud basically intact, but it allows us to make \nmore subtle analyses of the real dynamics of groups.\nFor example, Freud found that the leader allows us to express \nforbidden impulses and secret wishes. Redl saw that in some groups \nthere is indeed what he perfectly calls the “infectiousness of the \nunconflicted person.” There are leaders who seduce us because they \ndo not have the conflicts that we have; we admire their equanimity \nwhere we feel shame and humiliation. Freud saw that the leader \nwipes out fear and permits everyone to feel omnipotent. Redl re­\nfined this somewhat by showing how important the leader often was \nby the simple fact that it was he who performed the “initiatory act” \nwhen no one else had the daring to do it. Redl calls this beautifully \nthe “magic of the initiatory act.” This initiatory act can be anything \nfrom swearing to sex or murder. As Redl points out, according to \nits logic only the one who first commits murder is the murderer; all \nothers are followers. Freud has said in Totem and Taboo that acts \nthat are illegal for the individual can be justified if the whole group \nshares responsibility for them. But they can be justified in another \nway: the one who initiates the act takes upon himself both the risk \nand the guilt. The result is truly magic: each member of the group \ncan repeat the act without guilt. They are not responsible, only the \nleader is. Redl calls this, aptly, “priority magic.” But it does some­\nthing even more than relieve guilt: it actually transforms the fact of \nmurder. This crucial point initiates us directly into the phenome­\nnology of group transformation of the everyday world. If one \nmurders without guilt, and in imitation of the hero who runs the\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 135\n\f\n136 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nrisk, why then it is no longer murder: it is “holy aggression. For \nthe first one it was not.”21 In other words, participation in the group \nredistills everyday reality and gives it the aura of the sacred—just \nas, in childhood, play created a heightened reality.\nThis penetrating vocabulary of “initiatory acts,” “the infectious­\nness of the unconflicted person,” “priority magic,” and so on allows \nus to understand more subtly the dynamics of group sadism, the \nutter equanimity with which groups kill. It is not just that “father \npermits it” or “orders it.” It is more: the magical heroic transforma- \ntion of the world and of oneself. This is the illusion that man craves, \nas Freud said, and that makes the central person so effective a \nvehicle for group emotion.\nI am not going to try to repeat or sum up the subtleties of Redl’s \nessay here. Let us just underline the brunt of his argument which \nis that the “spell cast by persons”—as we have called it—is a very \ncomplex one, which includes many more things than meet the eye. \nIn fact, it may include everything but a spell. Redl showed that \ngroups use leaders for several types of exculpation or relief of con­\nflict, for love, or for even just the opposite—targets of aggressions \nand hate that pull the group together in a common bond. (As one \nrecent popular film advertisement put it: “They follow him bravely \ninto hell only for the pleasure of killing him and revenging them­\nselves.”) Redl was not out to replace Freud’s basic insights but \nonly to extend and add nuances to them. The instructive thing \nabout his examples is that most of the “central person’s” functions \ndo have to do with guilt, expiation, and unambiguous heroics. The \nimportant conclusion for us is that the groups “use” the leader \nsometimes with little regard for him personally, but always with \nregard to fulfilling their own needs and urges. W. R. Bion, in an \nimportant recent paper22 extended this line of thought even further \nfrom Freud, arguing that the leader is as much a creature of the \ngroup as they of him and that he loses his “individual distinctive­\nness” by being a leader, as they do by being followers. He has no \nmore freedom to be himself than any other member of the group, \nprecisely because he has to be a reflex of their assumptions in order \nto qualify for leadership in the first place.23\nAll of which leads us to muse wistfully on how unheroic is the \naverage man, even when he follows heroes. He simply loads them\n\f\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom137\nup with his own baggage; he follows them with reservations, with \na dishonest heart. The noted psychoanalyst Paul Schilder had al­\nready observed that man goes into the hypnotic trance itself with \nreservations. He said penetratingly that it was this fact that de­\nprived hypnosis of the “profound seriousness which distinguishes \nevery truly great passion.” And so he called it “timid” because it \nlacked “the great, free, unconditional surrender.”24 I think this \ncharacterization is beautifully apt to describe the timid “heroisms” \nof group behavior. There is nothing free or manly about them. Even \nwhen one merges his ego with the authoritarian father, the “spell” \nis in his own narrow interests. People use their leaders almosLa&..an \nexgu ^3&ken<4h a ^  leader’s nommandsJliev can aL\nways reserve the feeling that , these commands jre .alien, to them, \nthat they are the leader’s responsibility,, that the terrible^ acts they \n§re committing, are in his name and not theirs. This, then, is another \n'*lfftig that makes people feel so guiltless, as Canetti points out: they \ncan imagine themselves as. temporary victims of the leader.25 The \nmore they give in to his spell, and the more terrible the crimes \nthey commit, the more they can feel that the wrongs are not natural \nto them. It is all so neat, this usage of the leader; it reminds us of \n'![ James Frazer’s discovery that in the remote past tribes often used \n, their kings as scapegoats who, when they no longer served the \n{ people’s needs, were put to death. These are the many ways in \nJ which men can play the hero, all the while that they are avoiding \nt responsibility for iheir own acts in 3 cowardly way. \nj ' Very few people, for example, have been impressed with the \n, recent “heroics” of the Manson “family.” When we look at them in \n)! the light of the group dynamics we have been discussing, we can \nf . understand better why we are shocked—not only by the gratuitous \n, murders they committed, but by something more. When people try \n[ for heroics from the position of willing slavishness there is nothing \nto admire; it is all so automatic, predictable, pathetic. Here was a \n!; group of young men and women who had identified with Charles \n£ Manson and who lived in masochistic submission to him. They gave \nI?  him their total devotion and looked upon him as a human god of \n} some kind. In fact he filled the description of Freud’s “primal \nfather”: he was authoritarian, very demanding of his followers, and \na great believer in discipline. His eyes were intense, and for those\n\f\n138 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nwho came under his spell there is no doubt that he projected a \nhypnotic aura. He was a very self-assured figure. He even had his \nown “truth,” his megalomanic vision for taking over the world. To \nhis followers his vision seemed like a heroic mission in which they \nwere privileged to participate. He had convinced them that only \nby following out his plan could they be saved. The “family” was \nvery close, sexual inhibitions were nonexistent, and members had \nfree access to each other. They even used sex freely for the purpose \nof attracting outsiders into the family. It seems obvious from all \nthis that Manson combined the “fascinating effect of the narcissistic \npersonality” with the “infectiousness of the unconflicted per­\nsonality.” Everyone could freely drop his repressions under Manson’s \nexample and command, not only in sex but in murder. The members \nof the “family” didn’t seem to show any remorse, guilt, or shame for \ntheir crimes.\nPeople were astonished by this ostensible “lack of human feel­\ning.” But from the dynamics that we have been surveying, we are \nfaced with the even more astonishing conclusion that homicidal \ncommunities like the Manson “family” are not really devoid of basic \nhumanness. What makes them so terrible is that they exaggerate \nthe dispositions present in us all. Why should they feel guilt or \nremorse? The leader takes responsibility for the destructive act, and \nthose who destroy on his command are no longer murderers, but \n“holy heroes.” They crave to serve in the powerful aura that he \nprojects and to carry out the illusion that he provides them, an \nillusion that allows them to heroically transform the world. Under \nhis hypnotic spell and with the full force of their own urges for \nheroic self-expansion, they need have no fear; they can kill with \nequanimity. In fact they seemed to feel that they were doing their \nvictims “a favor,” which seems to mean that they sanctified them \nby including them in their own “holy mission.” As we have learned \nfrom the anthropological literature, the victim who is sacrificed be­\ncomes a holy offering to the gods, to nature, or to fate. The com­\nmunity gets more life by means of the victim’s death, and so the \nvictim has the privilege of serving the world in the highest possible \nway by means of his own sacrificial death.\nOne direct way, then, of understanding homicidal communities \nlike the Manson family is to view them as magical transformations,"

    "raw_text": "The Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom139\nwherein passive and empty people, torn with conflicts and guilt, \nearn their cheap heroism, really feeling that they can control fate \nand influence life and death. “Cheap” because not in their com­\nmand, not with their own daring, and not in the grip of their own \nfears: everything is done with the leader’s image stamped on their \npsyche.\nThe Larger View of Transference\nFrom this discussion of transference we can see one great cause \nof the large-scale ravages that man makes on the world. He is not \njust a naturally and lustily destructive animal who lays waste \naround him because he feels omnipotent and impregnable. Rather, \nhe is a trembling animal who pulls the world down around his \nshoulders as he clutches for protection and support and tries to \naffirm in a cowardly way his feeble powers. The qualities of the \nleader, then, and the problems of people fit together in a natural \nsymbiosis. I have lingered on a few refinements of group psy­\nchology to show that the powers of the leader stem from what he \ncan do for people, beyond the magic that he himself possesses. \nPeople project their problems onto him, which gives him his role \nand stature. Leaders need followers as much as they are needed \nby them: the leader projects onto his followers his own inability to| \nstand alone, his own fear of isolation. We must say that if there* \nwere no natural leaders possessing the magic of charisma, men \nwould have to invent them, just as leaders must create followers if \nthere are none available. If we accent this natural symbiotic side of \nthe problem of transference we come into the broadest under­\nstanding of it, which forms the main part of the discussion I now \nwant to dwell on.j\nf Now that we have sketched some of the highlights of the easy symbiosis \nof groups and leaders, we have to be careful not to leave a one-sided picture; \nthere is another side to show, a very different one. The guilt of all the fol­\nlowers does not vanish so easily under the spell of a leader, no matter how \nmuch he takes upon himself or how godlike he seems. Not everyone can be \nequally caught up in identification with him, and not everyone’s guilt is so \neasily overcome. Many people may feel deeply guilty if they violate long-\n\f\n140 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nstanding and deep-felt moral codes on his behalf. Yet, ironically, it is just this \nthat puts them even more in the leader’s power, makes them even more will­\ning putty in his hands.\nIf, as we have seen, the group comes ready-made to the leader with the \nthirst for servitude, he tries to deepen that servitude even further. If they \nseek to be free of guilt in his cause, he tries to load them up with an extra \nburden of guilt and fear to draw the mesh of his immorality around them. He \ngets a really coercive hold on the members of the group precisely because they \nfollow his lead in committing outrageous acts. He can then use their guilt \nagainst them, binding them closer to himself. He uses their anxiety for his \npurposes, even arousing it as he needs to; and he can use their fear of being \nfound out and revenged by their victims as a kind of blackmail that keeps \nthem docile and obedient for further atrocities. We saw a classic example of \nthis technique on the part of the Nazi leaders. It was the same psychology \nthat criminal gangs and gangsters have always used: to be bound closer \ntogether through the crime itself. The Nazis called it blood cement (Blutkitt), \nand the SS used it freely. For the lower echelons, service in the concentration \ncamps accomplished this loyalty; but the technique was also used on the \nhighest levels, especially with reluctant persons of prominence and talent whom \nthey wanted to recruit. These they induced to commit extra atrocities that \nindelibly identified them with the SS and gave them a new, criminal identity. \n(See Leo Alexander’s excellent paper: “Sociopsychologic Structure of the SS,” \nArchives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 1948, 59: 622-634.) And, as the Nazi \nepoch wore on and the toll of victims mounted, the leaders played upon the \nfears of reprisal by those who would revenge the victims the Nazis had made. \nIt was the old gangster trick, this time used to cement together a whole na­\ntion. Thus, what may begin as the heroic mission of a Hitler or a Manson \ncomes to be sustained by bullying and threats, by added fear and guilt. The \nfollowers find that they have to continue on with the megalomanic plan be­\ncause it becomes their only chance of survival in a hostile world. The followers \nmust do what the leader wants, which becomes what they themselves must \nwant in order to survive. If the leader loses, they too perish; they cannot quit, \nnor does he allow them to. And so the German nation fought on until the \nfinal destruction of Berlin; the Manson family held together under persecu­\ntion and his threats, to flee to the desert and await the end of the world. This \ngives an added dimension, too, to our understanding of why people stick with \ntheir leaders even in defeat, as the Egyptians did with Nasser. Without him \nthey may feel just too exposed to reprisal, to total annihilation. Having been \nbaptized in his fire they can no longer stand alone. (On all this see Ernst Kris, \n“The Covenant of the Gangsters,” Journal of Criminal Psychopathology, 1942- \n3, 4:441-454; Paul Roazen, Freud, pp. 238-242; T. W. Adorno, “Freudian \nTheory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda,” in Psychoanalysis and the \nSocial Sciences, 1951, pp. 298-300; and Ed Sanders, The Family: The Story \nof Charles Manson’s Dune Buggy Attack Battalion, (New York: Dutton, 1971). \nCf. esp. pp. 145, 199, 257.)\n\f\nFreud had already revealed as much about the problems of fol­\nlowers as about the magnetism of the leader, when he taught us \nabout the longing for transference and what it accomplished. But \njust here, trouble lies. As always, he showed us where to look but \nfocussed down too narrowly. He had a conception, as Wolstein \nsuccinctly put it, “of why man got into trouble,”26 and his explana­\ntions of trouble almost always came to rest on the sexual motive. \nThe fact that people were so prone to suggestibility in hypnosis \nwas for him proof that it depended on sexuality. The transference \nattraction that we feel for people is merely a manifestation of the \nearliest attractions that the child felt for those around him, but now \nthis purely sexual attraction is so buried in the unconscious that we \ndon’t realize what really motivates our fascinations. In Freuds un­\nmistakable words:\n.. .  we have to conclude that all the feelings of sympathy, friendship, \ntrust and so forth which we expend in life are genetically connected with \nsexuality and have developed out of purely sexual desires by an enfee­\nbling of their sexual aim, however pure and non-sensual they may appear \nin the forms they take on to our conscious self-perception. To begin with \nwe knew none but sexual objects; psycho-analysis shows us that those \npersons whom in real life we merely respect or are fond of may be sexual \nobjects to us in our unconscious minds still.27\nWe have already seen how this kind of reductionism to the sexual \nmotive got psychoanalysis itself into trouble very early and how it \nhas taken a succession of thinkers of great stature to extricate psy­\nchoanalysis from this obsession of Freuds. But in his later work \nFreud himself was not too troubled by his obsession when it came \nto explaining some things more broadly; the same holds true for his \nnarrow sexual emphasis on transference surrender. In 1912 he said \nthat the fact that transference could lead to complete subjection was \n, for him “unmistakable” proof of its “erotic character.”28 But in his \nI later work, when he accented more and more the terror of the \nhuman condition, he talked of the child’s longing for a powerful \nfather as a “protection against strange superior powers,” as a con­\nsequence of “human weakness” and “childish helplessness.”29 Yet, \nthis phrasing doesn’t represent an absolute abandonment of his \nearlier explanations. For Freud, “eros” covered not only specific\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 141"

    "raw_text": "sexual drives but also the child's longing for omnipotence, for the \noceanic feeling that comes with a merger with the parental powers. \nWith this kind of generalization Freud could have both his broader \nand narrower views at the same time. This complicated mixture of \nspecific error and correct generalization has made it a difficult and \nlengthy task for us to separate out what is true from what is false \nin psychoanalytic theory. But as we said earlier with Rank, it seems \nfairly conclusive that if you accent the terrors of external nature— \nas Freud did in his later work—then you are talking about the \ngeneral human condition and no longer about specific erotic drives. \nWe might say that the child would then seek merger with the \nparental omnipotence not out of desire but out of cowardice. And \nnow we are on a wholly new terrain. The fact that transference \ncould lead to complete subjection proves not its “erotic character” \nbut something quite different: its “truthful” character, we might \nsay. As Adler saw with complete clarity long before Freuds later \nwork: transference is fundamentally a problem of courage.30 As we \nhave learned conclusively from Rank and Brown, it is the im­\nmortality motive and not the sexual one that must bear the larger \nburden of our explanation of human passion. What does this crucial \nshift of emphasis mean for our understanding of transference? A \ntruly fascinating and comprehensive view of the human condition\n142 the denial of death\nTransference as Fetish Control\nIf transference relates to cowardice we can understand why it \ngoes all the way back to childhood; it reflects the whole of the \nchild’s attempts to create an environment that will give him safety \nand satisfaction; he learns to act and to perceive his environment \nqj in such a way that he banishes anxiety from it. But now the fatality \nof transference: when you set up your perception-action world to \neliminate what is basic to it (anxiety), then you fundamentally \nfalsify it. This is why psychoanalysts have always understood trans­\nference as a regressive phenomenon, uncritical, wishful, a matter of \nautomatic control of one’s world. Silverberg gives a classic psycho­\nanalytic definition: Transference\n\f\nindicates a need to exert complete control over external circumstances. \n... In all its variety and multiplicity of manifestation . . . transference \nmay be regarded as the enduring monument of man’s profound rebellion \nagainst reality and his stubborn persistence in the ways of immaturity.31\nFor Erich Fromm transference reflects man's alienation:\nIn order to overcome his sense of inner emptiness and impotence, [man]\n. . . chooses an object onto whom he projects all his own human qualities: \nhis love, intelligence, courage, etc. By submitting to this object, he feels \nin touch with his own qualities; he feels strong, wise, courageous, and \nsecure. To lose the object means the danger of losing himself. This \nmechanism, idolatric worship of an object, based on the fact of the in­\ndividual's alienation, is the central dynamism of transference, that which \ngives transference its strength and intensity.32\nJung's view was similar: fascination with someone is basically a \nmatter of\n. . . always trying to deliver us into the power of a partner who seems \ncompounded of all the qualities we have failed to realize in ourselves.33\nAnd so was the Adlerian view:\n[transference] ... is basically a maneuver or tactic by which the patient \nseeks to perpetuate his familiar mode of existence that depends on a \ncontinuing attempt to divest himself of power and place it in the hands \nof the “Other.”34\nI am citing these several authorities at length for two reasons: to \nshow the general truth of their insights and also to be able, later \non, to bring up the immense problems that these truths raise. Al­\nready we can see that transference is not a matter of unusual \ncowardice but rather of the basic problems of an organismic life, \nproblems of power and control: the strength to oppose reality and \nkeep it ordered for our own organismic expansion and fulfillment.\nWhat is more natural than choosing a person with whom to \nestablish this dialogue with nature? Fromm uses the word “idol” \nwhich is another way of talking about what is nearest at hand. This \nis how we understand the function of even the “negative” or “hate”\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 143\n\f\n144 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ntransference: it helps us to fix ourselves in the world, to create a \ntarget for our own feelings even though those feelings are destruc­\ntive. We can establish our basic organismic footing with hate as \nwell as by submission. In fact, hate enlivens us more, which is why \nwe see more intense hate in the weaker ego states. The only thing \nis that hate, too, blows the other person up larger than he deserves. \nAs Jung put it, the “negative form of transference in the guise of \nresistance, dislike, or hate endows the other person with great im­\nportance from the start. . . .”35 We need a concrete object for our \ncontrol, and we get one in whatever way we can. In the absence of \npersons for our dialogue of control we can even use our own body \nas a transference object, as Szasz has shown.36 The pains we feel, \nthe illnesses that are real or imaginary give us s^etETngTo r ^ te \nto, keep us from slipping” out of the world, from bogging down in \n“the desperation of compete lon^BiiS^Frim]^nQ^m™wo^rd, \niIteuSss~Ts an* object. We transfer to our own body as if it were a \nfriend on whom we can lean for strength or an enemy who threatens \nus with danger. At least it makes us feel real and gives us a little \npurchase on our fate.\nFrom all this we can already draw one important conclusion: \nthat transference is a form of fetishism, a form of narrow control \nthat anchors our own problems. We take our helplessness, our guilt, \nour conflicts, and we fix them to a spot in the environment. We can \ncreate any locus at all for projecting our cares onto the world, even \nthe locus of our own arms and legs. Our own cares are the thing; \nand if we look at the basic problems of human slavishness it is \nalways them that we see. As Jung put it in some beautiful words:\n. . unless we prefer to be made fools of by our illusions, we shall, \nby carefully analysing every fascination, extract from it a portion of \nour own personality, like a quintessence, and slowly come to \nrecognize that we meet ourselves time and again in a thousand \ndisguises on the path of life.”37\nTransference as Fear of Life\nBut this discussion has led us even further away from a simple, \nclinical approach to the phenomenon of transference. The fact is \nthat fascination is a reflex of the fatality of the human condition;\n\f\nand as we saw in Part I of this book, the human condition is just \ni too much for an animal to take; it is overwhelming. It is on this \n; aspect of the problem of transference that I now want to dwell. Of \nf all the thinkers who have understood it, none has written with \ngreater breadth and depth on the meanings of the transference than \nt Rank.\nj'. We have seen in several different contexts how Ranks system\n• of thought rests on the fact of human fear, the fear of life and \n! death. Here I want to accent how global or total this fear is. As \n: William James said, with his unfailing directness, fear is “fear of the \n' universe.” It is the fear of childhood, the fear of emerging into the \nr universe, of realizing one’s own independent individuality, one’s \n1' own living and experiencing. As Rank said, “The adult may have \n( fear of death or fear of sex, the child has a fear of life itself.”3* \nThis idea has been given wide currency by Fromm in several books, \nL as the “fear of freedom.” Schachtel put it well in speaking of the \nI fear of emerging out of “embeddedness.” This is how we under- \n| stand the “incestuousness” of the symbiosis with the mother and \njthe family: the person remains “tucked into” a protective womb, so \n' to speak. It is what Rank meant when he talked about the “trauma \nof birth” as being the paradigm for all other traumas of emergence, \ni  It is logical: if the universe is fundamentally and globally terrifying \nto the natural perceptions of the young human animal, how can he \nydare to emerge into it with confidence? Only by relieving it of its \nterror.\n! This is how we can understand the essence of transference: as a \nf taming of terror. Realistically the universe contains overwhelming \npower. Beyond ourselves we sense chaos. We can’t really do much \n\\ about this unbelievable power, except for one thing: we can endow \n[ certain persons with it. The child takes natural awe and terror and \nfocusses them on individual beings, which allows him to find the \npower and the horror all in one place instead of diffused through- \n[ out a chaotic universe. Mirabile! The transference object, being \nJ endowed with the transcendent powers of the universe, now has in \ni, himself the power to control, order, and coVnbat them.™ In Ranks \n[' words the transference object comes to represent for the individual \n1 “the great biological forces of nature, to which the ego binds itself \nemotionally and which then form the essence of the human and his \nfate.”40 By this means, the child can control his fate. As ultimately\n:  The Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 145\n\f\npower means power over life and death, the child can now safely \nemerge in relation to the transference object. The object becomes \n4is locus of safe operation. All he has to do is conform to it in the \nwaysTiat T^teaJtST^nciliate it if it becomes terrible; use it \nserenely for automatic daily activities. For this reason Angyal could \nwell say that transference is not an “emotional mistake” but the \nexperience of the other as ones whole world—just as the home \nactually is, for the child, his whole world.41\nThis totality of the transference object also helps explain its \nambivalence. In some complex ways the child has to fight against \nthe power of the parents in their awesome miraculousness. They \nare just as overwhelming as the background of nature from which \nthey emerge. The child learns to naturalize them by techniques of \naccommodation and manipulation. At the same time, however, he \nhas to focus on them the whole problem of terror and power, mak­\ning them the center of it in order to cut down and naturalize the \nworld around them. Now we see why the transference object poses \nso many problems. The child does partly control his larger fate by \nit, but it becomes his new fate. He binds himself to one person to \nautomatically control terror, to mediate wonder, and to defeat \ndeath by that person’s strength. But then he experiences “trans­\nference terror”; the terror of losing the object, of displeasing it, of \nnot being able to live without it. The terror of his own finitude and \nimpotence still haunts him, but now in the precise form of the \ntransference object. How implacably ironic is human life. The trans­\nference object always looms larger than life size because it repre­\nsents all of life and hence all of one’s fate. The transference object \nbecomes the focus of the problem of one’s freedom because one is \ncompulsively dependent on it; it sums up all other natural de­\npendencies and emotions.42 This quality is true of either positive or \nnegative transference objects. In the negative transference the object \nbecomes the focalization of terror, but now experienced as evil and \nconstraint. It is the source, too, of much of the bitter memories of \nchildhood and of our accusations of our parents. We try to make \nthem the sole repositories of our own unhappiness in a funda­\nmentally demonic world. We seem to be pretending that the world \ndoes not contain terror and evil but only our parents. In the nega­\ntive transference, too, then, we see an attempt to control our fate \nin an automatic way.\n146 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nNo wonder Freud could say that transference was a “universal \nphenomenon of the human mind” that “dominates the whole of each \npersons relation to his human environment.”43 Or that Ferenczi \ncould talk about the “neurotic passion for transference” the \n“stimulus-hungry affects of neurotics.”44 We don’t have to talk only \nabout neurotics but about the hunger and passion of everyone for a \nlocalized stimulus that takes the place of the whole world. We \nmight better say that transference proves that everyone is neurotic, \nas it is a universal distortion of reality by the artificial fixation of it.\nIt follows, of course, that the less ego power one has and the more \nfear, the stronger the transference. This explains the peculiar in­\ntensity of schizophrenic transference: the total and desperate focali- \nzation of horror and wonder in one person, and the abject surrender \nto him and complete worship of him in a kind of dazed, hypnotic \nway. Only to hear his voice or touch a piece of his clothing or be \ngranted the privilege of kissing and licking his feet—that would be \nheaven itself. This is a logical fate for the utterly helpless person \nthe more you fear death and the emptier you are the more you \npeople your world with omnipotent father-figures, extra-magical \nhelpers.45 The schizophrenic transference helps us to understand , \nhow naturally we remain glued to the object even in “normal” \ntransference: all the power to cure the diseases of life, the ills of the \nworld, are present in the transference object. How can we not be \nt its .spell?\nRemember we said the transference did not prove “eroticism,” \nas Freud earlier thought, but actually a certain “truthfulness” about \nthe terror of man’s condition. The schizophrenics extreme trans­\nference helps us to understand this statement too. After all, one of \nthe reasons that his world is so terrifying is that he sees it in many \nways unblurred by repression. And so he sees, too, the human \ntransference object in all of its awe and splendor—something we \ntalked about in an early chapter. The human face is really an awe­\nsome primary miracle; it naturally paralyzes you by its splendor if \nyou give in to it as the fantastic thing it is. But mostly we repress \nthis miraculousness so that we can function with equanimity and \ncan use faces and bodies for our own routine purposes. We may \nremember that as children there were those we did not dare talk to, \nor even look at—hardly something that we could carry over into \nO u r adult lives without seriously crippling ourselves. But now we\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 147\n\f\n148 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ncan point out, too, that this fear of looking the transference object \nfull in the face is not necessarily what Freud said it was: the fear \nI of the terrifying primal father. It is, rather, the fear of the reality \nI of the intense focalization of natural wonder and power; the fear of \nbeing overwhelmed by the truth of the universe as it exists, as that \ntruth is focussed in one human face. But Freud is right about \ntyrannical fathers: the more terrifying the object, the stronger the \ntransference; the more that the powerful object embodies in itself \nthe natural power of the world, the more terrifying it can be, in \nreality, without any imagination on our part.\nTransference as Fear of Death\nIf fear of life is one aspect of transference, its companion fear is \nright at hand. As the growing child becomes aware of death, he has \na twofold reason for taking shelter in the powers of the transference \nobject. The castration complex makes the body an object of horror, \nand it is now the transference object who carries the weight of the \nabandoned causa-sui project. The child uses him to assure his im­\nmortality. What is more natural? I cant resist quoting from another \nwriting, Gorki’s famous sentiment on Tolstoi, because it sums up so \nwell this aspect of transference: “I am not bereft on this earth, so \nlong as this old man is living on it.”46 This comes from the depth of \nGorki’s emotion; it is not a simple wish or a comforting thought: it \nis more like a driving belief that the mystery and solidity of the \ntransference object will give one shelter as long as he lives.\nThis use of the transference object explains the urge to deifica­\ntion of the other, the constant placing of certain select persons on \npedestals, the reading into them of extra powers: the more they \nhave, the more rubs off on us. We participate in their immortality, \n! and so we create immortals.47 As Harrington put it graphically: “I \nam making a deeper impression on the cosmos because I know this \nfamous person. When the ark sails I will be on it.”48 Man is always \nhungry, as Rank so well put it, for material for his own immortaliza­\ntion. Groups need it too, which explains the constant hunger for \nheroes:\n\f\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom149\nEvery group, however small or great, has, as such, an “individual” im- ; \npulse for etemalization, which manifests itself in the creation of and \"1 \ncare for national, religious, and artistic heroes ... the individual paves j \nthe way for this collective eternity impulse. . . .49 j\nThis aspect of group psychology explains something that other­\nwise staggers our imagination: have we been astonished by fan­\ntastic displays of grief on the part of whole peoples when one of \ntheir leaders dies? The uncontrolled emotional outpouring, the \ndazed masses standing huddled in the city squares sometimes for \ndays on end, grown people groveling hysterically and tearing at \nthemselves, being trampled in the surge toward the coffin or funeral \npyre—how to make sense out of such a massive, neurotic ‘Vaude­\nville of despair?50 In one way only: it shows a profound state of \nshock at losing one’s bulwark against death. The people apprehend, \nat some dumb level of their personality: “Our locus of power to | \ncontrol life and death can himself die; therefore our own im- I \nmortality is in doubt.” All the tears and all the tearing is after all I \nfor oneself, not for the passing of a great soul but for one’s own \nimminent passing. Immediately men begin to rename city streets, \nsquares, airports with the name of the dead man: it is as though to \ndeclare that he will be immortalized physically in the society, in \nspite of his own physical death. Compare the recent mournings of \nthe Americans for the Kennedys, the French for De Gaulle, and \nespecially the Egyptians for Nasser, which was a more primitive \nand elemental outpouring: immediately the cry was raised to \nrenew the war with Israel. As we have learned, only scapegoats \ncan relieve one of his own stark death fear: “7 am threatened with \ndeath—let us kill plentifully.” On the demise of an immortality- \nfigure the urge to scapegoating must be especially intense. So, too, \nis the susceptibility to sheer panic, as Freud showed.51 When the \nleader dies the device that one has used to deny the terror of the \nworld instantly breaks down; what is more natural, then, than to \nexperience the very panic that has always threatened in the back­\nground?\nThe void of immortality-substance that would be left by the \nabsolute abandonment of the leader is evidently too painful to sup­\nport, especially if the leader has possessed striking mana or has\n\f\nsummed up in himself some great heroic project that carried the \npeople on. One cant help musing about how one of the most ad­\nvanced scientific societies of the 20th century resorted to improve­\nments on ancient Egyptian mummification techniques to embalm \nthe leader of their revolution. It seems as though the Russians could \nnot let go of Lenin even in death and so have entombed him as a \npermanent immortality-symbol. Here is a supposedly “secular” \nsociety that holds pilgrimages to a tomb and that buries heroic \nfigures in the “sacred wall” of the Kremlin, a “hallowed” place. No \nmatter how many churches are closed or how humanistic a leader \nor a movement may claim to be, there will never be anything \nwholly secular about human fear. Mans terror is always “holy \nterror”—which is a strikingly apt popular phrase. Terror always \n] refers to the ultimates of life and death.52\n150 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nThe Twin Ontological Motives\nMuch of what we have said so far about transference puts man­\nkind in an unflattering light; it is now time to shift the tone. True, \ntransference is a reflex of cowardice in the face of both life and \ndeath, but it is also a reflex of the urge to heroism and self-unfold- \ning. This puts our discussion of transference on still a different \nlevel, and on this new perspective I now want to linger.\nOne thing that has always amazed man is his own inner yearning \nto be good, an inner sensitivity about the “way things ought to be,” \nand an excruciatingly warm and melting attraction toward the \n“rightness” of beauty, goodness, and perfection. We call this inner \nsensitivity “conscience.” For the great philosopher Immanuel Kant \nit was one of the two sublime mysteries of creation, this “moral law \nwithin” man, and there was no way to explain it—it was just given. \nNature carries feeling right in her own “heart,” in the interiors of \nstriving organisms. This self-feeling in nature is more fantastic than \nany science-fiction fact. Any philosophy or any science that is going \nto speak intelligently about the meaning of life has to take it into \naccount and treat it with the highest reverence—as 19th-century \nthinkers like Vincenzo Gioberti and Antonio Rosmini understood.53\n\f\nCuriously, this vital ontology of organismic self-feeling—which was \ncentral for thinkers like Thomas Davidson and Henri Bergson— \nhardly made a rustle in modern science until the appearance of the \nnew “humanistic psychology.” This fact alone seems to me to ex­\nplain the unbelievable sterility of the human sciences in our time \nand, more especially, their willingness to manipulate and negate \nman. I think that the true greatness of Freud’s contribution emerges \nwhen we see it as directly related to this tradition of ontological \nthought. Freud showed how the particular rules for goodness or \nconscience were built into the child in a given society, how he \nlearns the rules for feeling good. By showing the artificiality of \nthese social rules for feeling good, Freud mapped out the dream of \nfreedom of the Enlightenment: to expose artificial moral constraints \non the expansive self-feeling of the life force.\nBut the recognition of such social constraints still leaves unex­\nplained the inner urge of the human being to feel good and right \n—the very thing that awed Kant seems to exist independent of any \nrules: as far as we can tell—as I put it elsewhere—“all organisms \nlike to ‘feel good’ about themselves.”54 They push themselves to \nmaximize this feeling. As philosophers have long noted, it is as \nthough the heart of nature is pulsating in its own joyful self-expan- \nSion. When we get to the level of man, of course, this process \nacquires its greatest interest. It is most intense in man and in him \nrelatively undetermined—he can pulsate and expand both organis-\n• mically and symbolically. This expansion takes the form of man’s \ntremendous urge for a feeling of total “rightness” about himself and \nhis world. This perhaps clumsy way to talk seems to me to sum up \nwhat man is really trying to do and why conscience is his fate. Man \nis the only organism in nature fated to puzzle out what it actually \nmeans to feel “right/’\nBut on top of this special burden nature has arranged that it is \nImpossible for man to feel “right” in any straightforward way. Here \nwe have to introduce a paradox that seems to go right to the heart \nof organismic life and that is especially sharpened in man. The \nparadox takes the form of two motives or urges that seem to be part \nof creature consciousness and that point in two opposite directions. \nOn the one hand the creature is impelled by a powerful desire to \nidentify with the cosmic process, to merge himself with the rest of\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 151\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\nnature. On the other hand he wants to be unique, to stand out as \nsomething different and apart. The first motive—to merge and lose \noneself in something larger—comes from man’s horror of isolation, \nof being thrust back upon his own feeble energies alone; he feels \ntremblingly small and impotent in the face of transcendent nature. \nIf he gives in to his natural feeling of cosmic dependence, the desire \nto be part of something bigger, it puts him at peace and at oneness, \ngives him a sense of self-expansion in a larger beyond, and so \nheightens his being, giving him truly a feeling of transcendent \nvalue. This is the Christian motive of Agape—the natural melding \nof created life in the “Creation-in-love” which transcends it. As \nRank put it, man yearns for a “feeling of kinship with the AIL” He \nwants to be “delivered from his isolation” and become “part of a \ngreater and higher whole.” The person reaches out naturally for a \nself beyond his own self in order to know who he is at all, in order \nto feel that he belongs in the universe. Long before Camus penned \nthe words of the epigraph to this chapter, Rank said: “For only by \nliving in close union with a god-ideal that has been erected outside \none’s own ego is one able to live at all.”53 \nThe strength of Rank s work, which enabled him to draw such \nan unfailing psychological portrait of man in the round, was that he \nconnected psychoanalytic clinical insight with the basic ontological \nmotives of the human creature. In this way he got as deep into \nhuman motives as he could and produced a group psychology that \nwas really a psychology of the human condition. For one thing, we \ncould see that what the psychoanalysts call “identification” is a \nnatural urge to join in the overwhelming powers that transcend \none.56 Childhood identification is then merely a special case of this \nurge: the child merges himself with the representatives of the \ncosmic process—what we have called the “transference focalization” \nof terror, majesty, and power. When one merges with the self- \ntranscending parents or social group he is, in some real sense, trying \nto live in some larger expansiveness of meaning. We miss the \ncomplexity of heroism if we fail to understand this point; we miss \nits complete grasp of the person—a grasp not only in the support \nof power that self-transcendence gives to him but a grasp of his \nwhole being in joy and love. The urge to immortality is not a simple \nreflex of the death-anxiety but a reaching out by one’s whole being\n\f\ntoward life. Perhaps this natural expansion of the creature alone \\ \ncan explain why transference is sucK a universal passion. I\nFrom this point of view ioo'^e'iihdefsTarid the idea of God as a \nlogical fulfillment of the Agape side of man’s nature. Freud seems \nto have scorned Agape as he scorned the religion that preached it.\nHe thought that man’s hunger for a God in heaven represented \neverything that was immature and selfish in man: his helplessness, \nhis fear, his greed for the fullest possible protection and satisfac­\ntion. But Rank understood that the idea of God has never been a \nsimple reflex of superstitious and selfish fear, as cynics and “realists” \nhave claimed. Instead it is an outgrowth of genuine life-longing, a \nreaching-out for a plenitude of meaning—as James taught us.57 It \nseems that the yielding element in heroic belongingness is inherent \nin the life force itself, one of the truly sublime mysteries of created \nlife. It seems that the life force reaches naturally even beyond the \nearth itself, which is one reason why man has always placed God \nin the heavens.\nWe said it is impossible for man to feel “right” in any straight­\nforward way, and now we can see why. He can expand his self­\nfeeling not only by Agape merger but also by the other ontological \nmotive Eros, the urge for more life, for exciting experience, for the \ndevelopment of the self-powers, for developing the uniqueness of \nthe individual creature, the impulsion to stick out of nature and \n; shine. Life is, after all, a challenge to the creature, a fascinating op­\nportunity to expand. Psychologically it is the urge for individuation: \nhow do I realize my distinctive gifts, make my own contribution to \ni the world through my own self-expansion?\nNow we see what we might call the ontological or creature j / \ntragedy that is so peculiar to man: If he gives in to Agape he risks ; I \nfailing to develop himself, his active contribution to the rest of j j \nlife. If he expands Eros too much he risks cutting himself off from j j \nnatural dependency, from duty to a larger creation; he pulls away j \n. from the healing power of gratitude and humility that he must j i \n, naturally feel for having been created, for having been given the 11 \n1 opportunity of life experience. If\nMan thus has the absolute tension of the dualism. Individuation \nmeans that the human creature has to oppose itself to the rest of \nnature. It creates precisely the isolation that one can't stand—and\nThe Spell Cast by Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 153\n\f\n154 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nyet needs in order to develop distinctively. It creates the difference \nthat becomes such a burden; it accents the smallness of oneself and \nthe sticking-outness at the same time. This is natural guilt. The \nperson experiences this as “unworthiness” or “badness” and dumb \ninner dissatisfaction.58 And the reason is realistic. Compared to the \nrest of nature man is not a very satisfactory creation. He is riddled \nwith fear and powerlessness.\nThe problem becomes how to get rid of badness, of natural guilt, \nwhich is really a matter of reversing one’s position vis-a-vis the uni- \nverse. It is a matter of achieving size, importance, durability: how \nto be bigger and better than one really is. The whole basis of the \nurge to goodness is to be something that has value, that endures.59 \nWe seem to know it intuitively when we console our children after \ntheir nightmares and other frights. We tell them not to worry, that \nthey are “good” and nothing can hurt them, and so on^podness —  \nsafety and special immunity. You might say that the urge to \nmorality is based entirely on the physical situation of the creature. \nMan is moral because he senses his true situation and what lies in \nstore for him, whereas other animals don’t. He uses morality to try \nto get a place of special belongingness and perpetuation in the \nuniverse, in two ways. First, he overcomes badness (smallness, un­\nimportance, finitude) by conforming to the rules made by the \nrepresentatives of natural power (the transference-objects); in this \nway his safe belongingness is assured. This too is natural: we tell \nthe child when he is good so that he doesn’t have to be afraid. \nSecond, he attempts to overcome badness by developing a really \nvaluable heroic gift, becoming extra-special.\nDo we wonder why one of mans chief characteristics is his \ntortured dissatisfaction with himself, his constant self-criticism? It \nis the only way he has to overcome the sense of hopeless limitation \nj inherent in his real situation. Dictators, revivalists, and sadists know \nj that people like to be lashed with accusations of their own basic \nj unworthiness because it reflects how they truly feel about them- \nI selves. The sadist doesn’t create a masochist; he finds him ready- \n[ made. Thus people are offered one way of overcoming unworth­\niness: the chance to idealize the self, to lift it onto truly heroic \nlevels. In this way man sets up the complementary dialogue with \nhimself that is natural to his condition. He criticizes himself be­\n\f\ncause he falls short of the heroic ideals he needs to meet in order to \nbe a really imposing creation.\nYou can see that man wants the impossible: He wants to lose \nhis isolation and keep it at the same time. He can’t stand the sense \nof separateness, and yet he cant allow the complete suffocating of \nhis vitality. He wants to expand by merging with the powerful \nbeyond that transcends him, yet he wants while merging with it to \nremain individual and aloof, working out his own private and \nsmaller-scale self-expansion. But this feat is impossible because it \nbelies the real tension of the dualism. One obviously can’t have \nmerger in the power of another thing and the development of one’s \nown personal power at the same time, at any rate not without \nambivalence and a degree of self-deception. But one can get around \nthe problem in one way: one can, we might say, “control the \nglaringness of the contradiction.” You can try to choose the fitting \nkind of beyond, the one in which you find it most natural to prac­\ntice self-criticism and self-idealization.60 In other words, you try to \nkeep your beyond safe. The fundamental use of transference, of \nwhat we could better call “transference heroics,” is the practice of \na safe heroism. In it we see the reach of the ontological dualism \nof motives right into the problem of transference and heroism, and \nwe are now in a position to sum up this matter.\nThe Spell Cast hy Persons—The Nexus of Unfreedom 155\nTransference as the Urge to Higher Heroism\nThe point of our brief discursus on ontological motives is to make \ncompellingly clear how transference is connected to the foundations \nof organismic life. We can now understand fully how wrong it \nwould be to look at transference in a totally derogatory way when it \nfulfills such vital drives toward human wholeness. Man needs to \ninfuse his life with value so that he can pronounce it “good.” The \ntransference-object is then a natural fetishization for man’s highest \nyearnings and strivings. Again we see what a marvelous “talent” \ntransference is. It is a form of creative fetishism, the establishment \nof a locus from which our lives can draw the powers they need and \nwant. What is more wanted than immortality-power? How wonder­\n\f\n156 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nful and how facile to be able to take our whole immortality-striving \nand make it part of a dialogue with a single human being. We \ndon't know, on this planet, what the universe wants from us or is \nprepared to give us. We don’t have an answer to the question that \ntroubled Kant of what our duty is, what we should be doing on \nearth. We live in utter darkness about who we are and why we are \nhere, yet we know it must have some meaning. What is more \nnatural, then, than to take this unspeakable mystery and dispel it \nstraightaway by addressing our performance of heroics to another \nhuman being, knowing thus daily whether this performance is good \nenough to earn us eternity. If it is bad, we know that it is bad by \nhis reactions and so are able instantly to change it. Rank sums up \nthis vital matter in a particularly rich, synthetic paragraph:\nHere we come upon the age-old problem of good and evil, originally \ndesignating eligibility for immortality, in its emotional significance of \nbeing liked or disliked by the other person. On this plane . . . personality \nis shaped and formed according to the vital need to please the other \nperson whom we make our “God,” and not incur his or her displeasure. \nAll the twistings of the . . . self, with its artificial striving for perfection \nand the unavoidable “relapses” into badness, are the result of these at­\ntempts to humanize the spiritual need for goodness.61\nAs we will see in the next chapters, one can nourish and expand his \nidentity of all kinds of “gods,” on heavens as well as hells. How a \nperson solves his natural yearnings for self-expansion and signifi- \ni cance determines the quality of his life. Transference heroics gives \n| man precisely what he needs: a certain degree of sharply defined \nf individuality, a definite point of reference for his practice of good- \nI ness, and all within a certain secure level of safety and control.\nIf transference heroics were safe heroism we might think it de­\nmeaning. Heroism is by definition defiance of safety. But the point \nthat we are making is that all the strivings for perfection, the twist­\nings and turnings to please the other, are not necessarily cowardly \nor unnatural. What makes transference heroics demeaning is that \nthe process is unconscious and reflexive, not fully in one s control. \nPsychoanalytic therapy directly addresses itself to this problem. \nBeyond that, the other person is man’s fate and a natural one.

Human \nbeings are the only things that mediate meaning, which is to say \nthat they give the only human meaning we can know. Jung has \n:■ written some particularly brilliant and penetrating pages on trans­\nference, and he has seen that the urge is so strong and natural that \nj he has even called it an “instinct”—a “kinship libido.” This instinct, \nhe says, cannot be satisfied in any abstract way:\nIt wants the human connection. That is the core of the whole trans­\nference phenomenon, and it is impossible to argue it away, because re­\nlationship to the self is at once relationship to our fellow man. . . ,62\nA century earlier Hermann Melville had put the same thought into \nthe mouth of Ahab:\nClose! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is \nbetter than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By the \ngreen land; by the bright hearthstone! this is the magic glass, man; I see \nmy wife and my child in thine eye.63\nThe meaning of this need for other men to affirm oneself was seen \nbeautifully by the theologian Martin Buber. He called it “imagin­\ning the real”: seeing in the other person the self-transcending life \nprocess that gives to ones self the larger nourishment it needs.64 In \nterms of our earlier discussion we could say that the transference \nobject contains its own natural awesomeness, its own miraculous­\nness, which infects us with the significance of our own lives if we \ngive in to it. Paradoxically, then, transference surrender to the \n“truth of the other,” even if only in his physical being, gives us a \nfeeling of heroic self-validation. No wonder that Jung could say \nthat it is “impossible to argue away.”\nNo wonder too, for a final time, that transference is a universal \npassion. It represents a natural attempt to be healed and to be \nwhole, through heroic self-expansion in the “other.” Transference \nrepresents the larger reality that one needs, which is why Freud \nand Ferenczi could already say that transference represents psycho­\n\f\ntherapy, the “self-taught attempts on the patient's part to cure \nhimself.”65 People create the reality they need in order to discover \nthemselves. Ine implications of tfiese remarks are perhaps not im­\nmediatelyevident, but they are immense for a theory of the trans­\nference. If transference represents the natural heroic striving for a \n“beyond” that gives self-validation and if people need this valida­\ntion in order to live, then the psychoanalytic view of transference \nas simply unreal projection is destroyed.66 Projection is necessary \nand desirable for self-fulfillment. Otherwise man is overwhelmed \nby his loneliness and separation and negated by the very burden \nof his own life. As Rank so wisely saw, projection is a necessary \nunburdening of the individual; man cannot live closed upon himself \nand for himself. He must project the meaning of his life outward, \nthe reason for it, even the blame for it. We did not create ourselves, \nbut we are stuck with ourselves. Technically we say that trans­\nference is a distortion of reality. But now we see that this distortion \nhas two dimensions: distortion due to the fear of life and death and \ndistortion due to the heroic attempt to assure self-expansion and \nthe intimate connection of ones inner self to surrounding nature. \nIn other words, transference reflects the whole of the human condi­\ntion and raises the largest philosophical question about that condi­\ntion.\nHow big a piece of “reality” can man bite off without narrowing \nit down distortingly? If Rank, Camus, and Buber are right, man \ncannot stand alone but has to reach out for support. If transference \nis a natural function of heroism, a necessary projection in order to \nstand life, death, and oneself, the question becomes: What is \ncreative projection? What is life-enhancing illusion? These are ques­\ntions that take us way beyond the scope of this chapter, but we \nshall see the reach of them in our concluding section.\n158 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

Little did it matter that the earth was a vale \nof tears, of horrid sufferings, of incommensurateness, of torturous \nand humiliating daily pettiness, of sickness and death, a place where \nman felt he did not belong, “the wrong place,” as Chesterton said,2 \nthe place where man could expect nothing, achieve nothing for \nhimself. Little did it matter, because it served God and so would \nserve the servant of God. In a word, man’s cosmic heroism was as­\nsured, even if he was as nothing. This is the most remarkable \nachievement of the Christian world picture: that it could take \nslaves, cripples, imbeciles, the simple and the mighty, and make \nthem all secure heroes, simply by taking a step back from the world \ninto another dimension of things, the dimension called heaven. Or \nwe might better say that Christianity took creature consciousness— \nthe thing man most wanted to deny—and made it the very condi­\ntion for his cosmic heroism.\nl6o THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nThe Romantic Solution\nOnce we realize what the religious solution did, we can see how \nmodern man edged himself into an impossible situation. He still \nneeded to feel heroic, to know that his life mattered in the scheme \nof things; he still had to be specially “good” for something truly \nspecial. Also, he still had to merge himself with some higher, self­\nabsorbing meaning, in trust and in gratitude—what we saw as the \nuniversal motive of the Agape-merger. If he no longer had God, \nhow was he to do this? One of the first ways that occurred to him, \nas Rank saw, was the “romantic solution”: he fixed his urge to \ncosmic heroism onto another person in the form of a love object.3 \nThe self-glorification that he needed in his innermost nature he now \nlooked for in the love partner. The love partner becomes the divine \nI ideal within which to fulfill one’s life. All spiritual and moral needs \n'i j now become focussed in one individual. Spirituality, which once \nreferred to another dimension of things, is now brought down to \nthis earth and given form in another individual human being. Salva­\ntion itself is no longer referred to an abstraction like God but can \nbe sought “in the beatification of the other.” We could call this\n\f\n“transference beatification.” Man now lives in a “cosmology of two.”4 \nTo be sure, all through history there has been some competition be­\ntween human objects of love and divine ones—we think of Heloise \nand Abelard, Alcibiades and Socrates, or even the Song of Solomon. \nBut the main difference is that in traditional society the human part \nner would not absorb into himself the whole dimension of the divine \nin modem society he does.\nIn case we are inclined to forget how deified the romantic love \nobject is, the popular songs continually remind us. They tell us that \nthe lover is the “springtime,” the “angel-glow,” with eyes “like \nstars,” that the experience of love will be “divine,” “like heaven” \nitself, and so on and on; popular love songs have surely had this \ncontent from ancient times and will likely continue to have it as \nlong as man remains a mammal and a cousin of the primates. These \nsongs reflect the hunger for real experience, a serious emotional \nyearning on the part of the creature. The point is that if the love \nobject is divine perfection, then one’s own self is elevated by join­\ning one’s destiny to it. One has the highest measure for one’s ideal- \nstriving; all of one's inner conflicts and contradictions, the many \naspects of guilt—all these one can try to purge in a perfect con­\nsummation with perfection itself. This becomes a true “moral vin­\ndication in the other.”5 Modern man fulfills his urge to self­\nexpansion in the love object just as it was once fulfilled in God: \n“God as . . . representation of our own will does not resist us except \nwhen we ourselves want it, and just as little does the lover resist \nus who, in yielding, subjects himself to our will.”6 In one word, \nthe love object is God. As a Hindu song puts it: “My lover is like \nGod; if he accepts me my existence is utilized.” No wonder Rank \ncould conclude that the love relationship of modern man is a \nreligious problem.7\nUnderstanding this, Rank could take a great step beyond Freud. \nFreud thought that modem man’s moral dependence on another \nwas a result of the Oedipus complex. But Rank could see that it was \nthe result of a continuation of the causa-sui project of denying \ncreatureliness. As now there was no religious cosmology into which \nto fit such a denial, one grabbed onto a partner. Man reached for \na “thou” when the world-view of the great religious community \noverseen by God died. Modem man’s dependency on the love\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 161\n\f\n162 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\npartner, then, is a result of the loss of spiritual ideologies, just as is \nhis dependency on his parents or on his psychotherapist. He needs \nsomebody, some “individual ideology of justification” to replace the \ndeclining “collective ideologies.”8 Sexuality, which Freud thought \nwas at the heart of the Oedipus complex, is now understood for \nwhat it really is: another twisting and turning, a groping for the \nmeaning of one’s life. If you don’t have a God in heaven, an in­\nvisible dimension that justifies the visible one, then you take what \nis nearest at hand and work out your problems on that.\nAs we know from our own experience this method gives great and \n‘real benefits. Is one oppressed by the burden of his life? Then he \ncan lay it at his divine partner’s feet. Is self-consciousness too pain­\nful, the sense of being a separate individual, trying to make some \nkind of meaning out of who one is, what life is, and the like? Then \none can wipe it away in the emotional yielding to the partner, for­\nget oneself in the delirium of sex, and still be marvellously quick­\nened in the experience. Is one weighed down by the guilt of his \nbody, the drag of his animality that haunts his victory over decay \nand death? But this is just what the comfortable sex relationship \nis for: in sex the body and the consciousness of it are no longer \nseparated; the body is no longer something we look at as alien to \nourselves. As soon as it is fully accepted as a body by the partner, \nour self-consciousness vanishes; it merges with the body and with \nthe self-consciousness and body of the partner. Four fragments of \nexistence melt into one unity and things are no longer disjointed and \ngrotesque: everything is “natural,” functional, expressed as it should \nbe—and so it is stilled and justified. All the more is guilt wiped \naway when the body finds its natural usage in the production of a \nchild. Nature herself then proclaims one’s innocence, how fitting it \nis that one should have a body, be basically a procreative animal.9\nBut we also know from experience that things don’t work so \nsmoothly or unambiguously. The reason is not far to seek: it is right \nat the heart of the paradox of the creature. Sex is of the body, and \nthe body is of death. As Rank reminds us, this is the meaning of the \nBiblical account of the ending of paradise, when the discovery of \nsex brings death into the world. As in Greek mythology too, Eros \nand Thanatos are inseparable; death is the natural twin brother of \nsex.10 Let us linger on this for a moment because it is so central to\n\f\nthe failure of romantic love as a solution to human problems and \nis so much a part of modern mans frustration. When we say that \nsex and death are twins, we understand it on at least two levels. \nThe first level is philosophical-biological. Animals who procreate, \ndie. Their relatively short life span is somehow connected with \ntheir procreation. Nature conquers death not by creating eternal \norganisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to pro­\ncreate. Evolutionarily this seems to have made it possible for really \ncomplex organisms to emerge in the place of simple—and almost \nliterally eternal—self-dividing ones.\nBut now the rub for man. If sex is a fulfillment of his role as an \nanimal in the species, it reminds him that he is nothing himself but \na link in the chain of being, exchangeable with any other and com­\npletely expendable in himself. Sex represents, then, species con­\nsciousness and, as such, the defeat of individuality, of personality. \nBut it is just this personality that man wants to develop: the idea \nof himself as a special cosmic hero with special gifts for the uni­\nverse. He doesn’t want to be a mere fornicating animal like any \nother—this is not a truly human meaning, a truly distinctive con­\ntribution to world life. From the very beginning, then, the sexual \nact represents a double negation: by physical death and of distinc­\ntive personal gifts. This point is crucial because it explains why \nsexual taboos have been at the heart of human society since the \nvery beginning. They affirm the triumph of human personality over \nanimal sameness. With the complex codes for sexual self-denial, \nman was able to impose the cultural map for personal immortality \nover the animal body. He brought sexual taboos into being because \nhe needed to triumph over the body, and he sacrificed the pleasures \nof the body to the highest pleasure of all: self-perpetuation as a \nspiritual being through all eternity. This is the substitution that \nRoheim was really describing when he made his penetrating obser­\nvation on the Australian aborigines: “The repression and sublima­\ntion of the primal scene is at the bottom of totemistic ritual and \nreligion,”11 that is, the denial of the body as the transmitter of \npeculiarly human life.\nThis explains why people chafe at sex, why they resent being \nreduced to the body, why sex to some degree terrifies them: it \nrepresents two levels of the negation of oneself. Resistance to sex is\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 163\n\f\n164 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\na resistance to fatality. Here Rank has written some of his most \nbrilliant lines. He saw that the sexual conflict is thus a universal \none because the body is a universal problem to a creature who \nmust die. One feels guilty toward the body because the body is a \nbind, it overshadows our freedom. Rank saw that this natural guilt \nbegan in childhood and led to the anxious questions of the child \nabout sexual matters. He wants to know why he feels guilt; even \nmore, he wants the parents to tell him that his guilt feeling is \njustified. Here we have to remind ourselves of the perspective we \nused in Part I to introduce the problem of human nature. We saw \nthat the child stands right at the crossroads of the human dualism. \nHe discovers that he has a fallible body, and he is learning that \nthere is a whole cultural world-view that will permit him to triumph \nover it. The questions about sex that the child asks are thus not— \nat a fundamental level—about sex at all. They are about the mean­\ning of the body, the terror of living with a body. When the parents \ngive a straightforward biological answer to sexual questions, they \ndo not answer the child’s question at all. He wants to know why \nkhe has a body, where it came from, and what it means for a self- \ni conscious creature to be limited by it. He is asking about the \nI ultimate mystery of life, not about the mechanics of sex. As Rank \nI says, this explains why the adults suffer as much from the sexual \n|problem as the child: the “biological solution of the problem of \n.lhumanity is also ungratifying and inadequate for the adult as for \nJthe child.”12\nf Sex is a “disappointing answer to life’s riddle,” and if we pretend \nj that it is an adequate one, we are lying both to ourselves and to our \nJ children. As Rank beautifully argues, in this sense “sex education” \nis a kind of wishful thinking, a rationalization, and a pretense: we \ntry to make believe that if we give instruction in the mechanics of \nsex we are explaining the mystery of life. We might say that modern \nman tries to replace vital awe and wonder with a “How to do it” \nmanual.13 We know why: if you cloak the mystery of creation in the \neasy steps of human manipulations you banish the terror of the \ndeath that is reserved for us as species-sexual animals. Rank goes \nso far as to conclude that the child is sensitive to this kind of lying. \nHe refuses the “correct scientific explanation” of sexuality, and he \nrefuses too the mandate to guilt-free sex enjoyment that it implies.14\n\f\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 165\nI think that the reason probably is that if he is to grow into an im­\nmortal culture hero he must have a clear antagonist, especially at \nthe beginning of his struggles to incorporate the cultural causa-sui \nproject. As the body is the clear problem over which he must \ntriumph in order to build a cultural personality at all, he must \nresist, at some level, the adults attempt to deny that the body is an \nadversary. We might say that the child is still too weak to be able \nto bear the conflict of trying to be a personality and a species \nanimal at the same time. The adult is, too, but he has been able to \ndevelop the necessary mechanisms of defense, repression anddenial \nj that allow him to live with the problem ot serving two masters.\n’Alter this reminder of the fundamental problems of the child and \nthe adult that we talked about in Part I, I hope that we can better \nunderstand the roots of Rank’s critique of the “romantic” psycho­\nlogical type that has emerged in modem times. It then becomes \nperfectly clear what he means when he says that \"personality is \nultimately destroyed by and through sex.”15 In other words the \nseviialljartnpr dons not and cannot represent a completeand lasting \nsolution to the human dilemma.16 The partner represents a kind of \nfulfillment in freedom from self-consciousness and guilt; but at thg \nsanre~rEiifle He represents the negation of one’s distinctive per­\nsonality. We might say the more guilt-free sex the better, but only \niff) to a certain point. In Hitlerism, we saw the misery that resulted \nwhen man confused two worlds, when he tried to get a clear-cut \ntriumph over evil, a perfection in this world that could only be \npossible in some more perfect one. Personal relationships carry the \nsame danger of confusing the real facts of the physical world and \nthe ideal images of spiritual realms. The romantic love “cosmology \nof two” may be an ingenious and creative attempt, but because it \nis still a continuation of the causa-sui project in this world, it is a \nlie that must fail. If the partner becomes God he can just as easily \nbecome the Devil; the reason is not far to seek. For one thing, one \nBecomes hound to the object in dependency. One needs it for self­\njustification. One can be utterly dependent whether one needs the \nobject as a source of strength, in a masochistic way, or whether one \nneeds it to feel one’s own self-expansive strength, by manipulating \nit sadistically. In ejthercase one’s self-development is restricted by \nthe object, absorbed bv^tTrisToo^narrow a fetishization of mean-\n\f\ni66 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nL\ning, and one comes to resent it and chafe at it. If you find the ideal \nlove and try to make it the sole judge of good and bad in yourself, \nthe measure of your strivings, you become simply the reflex of \nanother person. You lose yourself irTthe other, just as obedient chil­\ndren lose themselves in the family. No wonder that dependency, \nwhether of the god or the slave in the relationship, carries with it so \nmuch underlying resentment. As Rank put it, explaining the his­\ntorical bankruptcy of romantic love: a “person no longer wanted to \nbe used as another’s soul even with its attendant compensations.”17 \nWhen you confuse personal love and cosmic heroism you are bound \nto fail in both spheres. The impossibility of the heroism undermines \nthe love, even if it is real. As Rank so aptly says, this double failure \nis what produces the sense of utter despair that we see in modem \nman. Ij is impossible to get blood from a stone, to get spirituality \nfrom a physical being, and so one feels “Inferior” KT<TlTfip has \nsomehow not succeededr4hat he has not realized his true gifts, and \nso on.18.\nNo wonder. How can a human being be a god-like “everything” \nto another? No human relationship can bear the burden of godhood, \nand the attempt has to take its toll in some way on both parties. \nThe reasons are not far to seek. The thing that makes God the \nperfect spiritual object is precisely that he is abstract—as Hegel \nsaw.19 He is not a concrete individuality, and so He does not limit \nour development by His own personal will and needs. When we \nlook for the “perfect” human object we are looking for someone who \nallows us to express our will completely, without any frustration or \nfalse notes. We want an object that reflects a truly ideal image of \nourselves.20 But no human object can do this; humans have wills \nand counterwills of their own, in a thousand ways they can move \nagainst us, their very appetites offend us.21 God’s greatness and \npower is something that we cin nourish ourselves in, without its \nbeing compromised in any way by the happenings of this world. No \nhuman partner can offer this assurance because the partner is real. \nHowever much we may idealize and idolize him, he inevitably re­\nflects earthly decay and imperfection. And as he is our ideal \nmeasure of value, this imperfection falls back upon us. If vour \npartner is your “AH” then any shortcoming jr> him. a majnr\nthreat to you."

    "raw_text": "If a woman loses her beauty, or shows that she doesn’t have the \nstrength and dependability that we once thought she did, or loses \nher intellectual sharpness, or falls short of our own peculiar needs \nin any of a thousand ways, then all the investment we have made in \nher is undermined. The shadow of imperfection falls over our lives, \nand with it—death and the defeat of cosmic heroism. “She lessens”\n= “I die.” This is the reason for so much bitterness, shortness of \ntemper and recrimination in our daily family lives. We get back a \nreflection from our loved objects that is less than the grandeur and \nperfection that we need to nourish ourselves. We feel diminished \nby their human shortcomings. Our interiors feel empty or anguished, \nour lives valueless, when we see the inevitable pettinesses of the \nworld expressed through the human beings in it. For this reason, \ntoo, we often attack loved ones and try to bring them down to size. \nWe see that our gods have clay feet, and so we must hack away at \nthem in order to save ourselves, to deflate the unreal over-invest­\nment that we have made in them in order to secure our own \napotheosis.

We want redemption—nothing less. \nWe want to be rid of our faults, of our feeling of nothingness. We \nwant to be justified, to know that ^ur creation has not beenin vain. \nWe turn to the love partner for the experience of the heroic, for \nperfect validation; we expect them to “make us good” through \nlove.23 Needless to say, human partners can’t do this. The lover does \nnot dispense cosmic heroism; he cannot give absolution in his own \nname. The reason is that as a finite being he too is doomed, and we \nread that doom in his own fallibilities, in his very deterioration. \nRedemption can only come from— outside individual from\n__\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 167\n\f\ni68 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nbeyond, from our conceptualization of the ultimate source of things. \ntSe perfection of creatiomTFHn\"onl)rcome, as Rank saw, when we \nlay dowrTour individuality, give it up, admit our creatureliness and \nhelplessness.24 What partner would ever permit us to do this, would \nbear us if we did? The partner needs us to be as God. On the other \nhand, what partner could ever want to give redemption—unless he \nwas mad? Even the partner who plays God in the relationship \ncannot stand it for long, as at some level he knows that he does not \npossess the resources that the other needs and claims. He does not \nhave perfect strength, perfect assurance, secure heroism. He cannot \nstand the burden of godhood, and so he must resent the slave. Be­\nsides, the uncomfortable realization must always be there: how can \none be a genuine god if one’s slave is so miserable and unworthy?\nRank saw too, with the logic of his thought, that the spiritual \nburdens of the modern love relationship were so great and impos­\nsible on both partners that they reacted by completely despiritualiz- \ning or depersonalizing the relationship. The result is the Playboy \nmystique: over-emphasis on the body as a purely sensual object.2®Jf \nI can’t have an ideal[that fulfills my life, then at least I can have \nguilt-free sex—somoSern man seems to reason. But we can quickly \nconclude how self-defeating this solution is because it brings us \nright back to the dreaded equation of sex with inferiority and death, \nwith service to the species and the negation of one’s distinctive \npersonality, the real symbolic heroism, jfa wonder the sexual^ \nmystique_i£-£U£h a shallow creed. It has to be practised by those \nwho have despaired of cosmic heroism, who have narrowed their \nmeanings down to the body and to this world alone.

Only now you must find it in the things of \njJiiS-world. The romantic lover seeks it in the deep interiority of the \nwoman, in her natural mystery. He looks for her to be a source of \nwisdom, of sure intuition, a bottomless well of continually renewed \nstrength. The sensualist seeks the absolute no longer in the woman, \nwho is a mere thing that one works on. He must then find the\n\f\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard\nabsolute in himself, in the vitality that the woman arouses and un­\nleashes. This is why virility becomes such a predominant problem \nfor him—it is his absolute self-justification in this world. Mike \nNichols recently contrasted the romantic and the sensualist in his \nbrilliant film Carnal Knowledge: the romantic ends up with an 18- \nyear-old hippie who is “wise beyond her years” and who comes \nout with unexpected things from the deep of her natural femininity; \nthe sensualist ends a 20-year span of sexual conquests stuck with \nthe problem of his own virility. In the marvelous scene at the end \nwe see the well-schooled prostitute giving him an erection by con­\nvincing him of his own inner powers and natural strength. Both of \nthese types meet, in the film, on the middle ground of utter confu­\nsion about what one should get out of a world of breasts and but­\ntocks and of rebellion against what the species demands of them.\nThe sensualist tries to avoid marriage with all his might, to defeat \nthe species role by making sexuality a purely personal affair of con­\nquests and virility. The romantic rises above marriage and sex by \ntrying to spiritualize his relationship to women. Neither type can \nunderstand the other except on the level of elemental physical \ndesire; and the film leaves us with the reflection that both are \npitifully immersed in the blind groping of the human condition, the \nreaching out for an absolute that can be seen and experienced. It \nis as though Rank himself had helped write the script; but it was \nthat modern artistic “Rankian” of the love relationship, Jules Feiffer, \nwho did.\nSometimes, it is true, Rank seems so intent on calling our atten­\ntion to problems that transcend the body that one gets the impres­\nsion that he failed to appreciate the vital place that it has in our \nrelationships to others and to the world. But thatis not at all true, i \nThe great lesson of Rank’s depreciation orsexualitywas not that he j \nplayed down physical love and sensuality, but that he saw—like \nAugustine and K^rkegaajj=that-jnan canno'flasHi^^ \nfroflCIwithiir hiT^conditionrjjh at cosmic heroism must transcend • \nhuman relationships.26 What is at stake in all this is. of course, the > \nquestion pf^Rednm^ thf^iality-oLone’s life and x)ne,s..indivi(ESity V\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, people need a “beyond,” but ff \nthey reach first for the nearest one; this gives them the fulfillment \nthey need but at the same time limits and enslaves them. You can *\n\f\n170 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nlook at the whole problem of a human life in this way. You can ask \nthe question: What kind of beyond does this person try to expand \nin; and how much individuation does he achieve in it? Most people \nI play it safe: they choose the beyond of standard transference ob- \nI jects like parents, the boss, or the leader; they accept the cultural \nj  definition of heroism and try to be a “good provider” or a “solid” \njl citizen. In this way they earn their species immortality as an agent \n!j of procreation, or a collective or cultural immortality as part of a social \njj group of some kind. Most people live this way, and I am hardly \n? implying that there is anything false or unheroic about the standard \n' cultural solution to the problems of men. It represents both the \ntruth and the tragedy of mans condition: the problem of the con­\nsecration of ones life, the meaning of it, the natural surrender to \nsomething larger—these driving needs that inevitably are resolved \nby what is nearest at hand.\nWomen are peculiarly caught up in this dilemma, that the now \n|surging “womens liberation movement” has not yet conceptualized. \nI Rank understood it, both in its necessary aspect and in its constric­\ntive one. The woman, as a source of new life, a part of nature, can \nfind it easy to willingly submit herself to the procreative role in \nmarriage, as a natural fulfillment of the Agape motive. At the same \ntime, however, it becomes self-negating or masochistic when she \nsacrifices her individual personality and gifts by making the man and \nhis achievements into her immortality-symbol. The Agape surrender \nis natural and represents a liberating self-fulfillment; but the re­\nflexive internalization of the males life role is a surrender to one’s \nown weakness, a blurring of the necessary Eros motive of ones own \nidentity. The reason that women are having such trouble disentan­\ngling the problems of their social and female roles from that of their \ndistinctive individualities is that these things are intricately con­\nfused. The line between natural self-surrender, in wanting to be a \npart of something larger, and masochistic or self-negating surrender \nis thin indeed, as Rank saw.27 The problem is further complicated \n\\ by something that women—like everyone else—are loathe to admit: \n\\ their own natural inability to stand alone in freedom. This is why \n\\ almost everyone consents to earn his immortality in the popular \nWays mapped out by societies everywhere, in the beyonds of others \n^id not their own.\n\\\n\f\nThe Creative Solution\nThe upshot of all this is that personal heroism through individua­\ntion is a very daring venture precisely because it separates the per­\nson out of comfortable “beyonds.” It takes a strength and courage \nthe average man doesn’t have and couldn’t even understand—as \nJung so well points out.28 The most terrifying burden of the creature \nis to be isolated, which is what happens in individuation: one \nseparates himself out of the herd. This move exposes the person tq \njhe sense of being completely crustied and~armjEIlated becaus£uhe~- \nsticks out so much, has to carry so much in himself. These are the \nris!cs~when the persorT begins to fasEion~^onsciously and critically \nhis own framework of heroic self-reference.\nHere is precisely the definition of the artist type, or the creative \ntype generally. We have crossed a threshold into a new type of \nresponse to man’s situation. No one has written about this type of \nhuman response more penetratingly than Rank; and of all his books, \nArt and Artist is the most secure monument to his genius. I don’t \nwant, here, to get into the kind of agonizingly subtle insights on the \nartist that Rank has produced or to try to present his comprehen­\nsive picture; but it will reward us if we take this opportunity to go \na bit deeper than we have into the problem of personality dynamics. \nIt will prepare us, too, for a discussion of Rank’s views on neurosis, \nwhich are unparalleled in the psychoanalytic literature so far as I \nknow.\nThe key to the creative type is that he is separated out of the \ncommon pool of shared meanings. There is something in his life \nexperience that makes him take in the world as a problem; as a \nresult he has to make personal sense out of it. This holds true for all \ncreative people to a greater or lesser extent, but it is especially \nobvious with the artist. Existence becomes a problem that needs an \nideal answer; but when you no longer accept the collective solution \nto the problem of existence, then you must fashion your own. The \nwork of art is, then, the ideal answer of the creative type to the \nproblem of existence as he takes it in—not only the existence of \nthe external world, but especially his own: who he is as a painfully \nseparate person with nothing shared to lean on. He has to answer to \nthe burden of his extreme individuation, his so painful isolation.\nOtto Rank and the Cfosure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 171\n\f\n172 the denial of death\nHe wants to know how to earn immortality as a result of his own \nunique gifts. His creative work is at the same time the expression \nof his heroism and the justification of it. It is his “private religion” \n—as Rank put it.29 Its uniqueness gives him personal immortality; \nit is his own “beyond” and not that of others.\nNo sooner have we said this than we can see the immense prob­\nlem that it poses. How can one justify his own heroism? He would \nhave to be as God. Now we see even further how guilt is inevitable \nfor man: even as a creator he is a creature overwhelmed by the \ncreative process itself.30 If you stick out of nature so much that you \nyourself have to create your own heroic justification, it is too much. \nThis is how we understand something that seems illogical: that the \nmore you develop as a distinctive free and critical human being, \nthe more guilt you have. Your very work accuses you; it makes you \nfeel inferior. What right do you have to play God? Especially if \nyour work is great, absolutely new and different. You wonder where \nto get authority for introducing new meanings into the world, the \nstrength to bear it.31 It all boils down to this: the work of art is the \nartist’s attempt to justify his heroism objectively, in the concrete \ncreation. It is the testimonial to his absolute uniqueness and heroic \ntranscendence. But the artist is still a creature and he can feel it \nmore intensely than anyone else. In othes-^ords, he knows that the \nwork is he, therefore “bad.” ephemeral potentially meaningless— \nur1 and outside itself.\nartist’s own transference projection, and he knows that consciously \nand critically. Whatever he does he is stuck with himself, can’t get \nsecurely outside and beyond himself.32 He is also stuck with the \nwork of art itself. Like any material achievement it is visible, \nearthly, impermanent. No matter how great it is, it still pales in \nsome ways next to the transcending majesty of nature; and so it is \nambiguous, hardly a solid immortality symbol. In his greatest genius \nman is still mocked.

    "raw_text": "The whole thing boils down to this paradox: if you are going to \n>e a hero then you must give a gift. If you are the average man you \ngive your heroic gift to the society in which you live, and you give \n,the gift that society specifies in advance. If you are an artist you \n^fashion a peculiarly personal gift, the justification of your own \nheroic identity, which means that it is always aimed at least partly \nbver the heads of your fellow men. After all, they can’t grant the \nftnmortality of your personal soul. As Rank argued in the breath­\ntaking closing chapters of Art and Artist, there is no way for the \nArtist to be at peace with his work or with the society that accepts \nit. The artist’s gift is always to creation itself, to the ultimate mean­\ning of life, to God. We should not be surprised that Rank was \nbrought to exactly the same conclusion as jCierkegaard: that the \nonly way out of human conflict ic full renunciation, to give one’s \nlife as a gift to the highest powers. Absolution has to come from the \nabsolute\" beyond. As Kierkegaard^, Rank showed that this rule ap­\nplied to the strongest, most heroic types—not to trembling and \nempty, weaklings. To renounce the world and oneself, to lay tke \nmeaning of it to the powers of creationT  is the hardest tlnn^ior \nman to achieve—and soltls fitting~that this task should fall toTKe \nWrongest personality typertEe~one~with^the largest ego.\\The gre~at \nscientific world-shaker Newton was the same man who always \ncarried the Bible under his arm.\ni Even in such cases, the combination of fullest self-expression and \nrenunciation is rare, as we saw in Chapter Six when we speculated \n»  about Freud’s lifelong problem. From all that we have,now covered \n* —the self in history and in personal creativity—we can perhaps \ndraw even closer to the problem of Freud. We know that he was a \ngenius, and we can now see the real problem that genius has: how \n1 to develop a creative work with the full force of one’s passion, a \nwork that saves one’s soul, and at the same time to renounce that \n| very work because it cannot by itself give salvation. In the creative \n’genius we see the need to combine the most intensive Eros of self- \nexpression with the most complete Agape of self-surrender. It is \nalmost too much to ask of men that they contrive to experience \n: fully both these intensities of ontological striving. Perhaps men with \nfeg^er gifts have it easier: a small dosage of Eros and a comfortable \nAgape. Freud lived the daimon of his Eros to the hilt and more\n* 1 Otto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard 173\n\f\n174 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nhonestly than most, and it consumed him and others around him, \nas it always does more or less. Psychoanalysis was his personal \nheroic bid for immortality. As Rank said: “. . . he himself could so \neasily confess his agnosticism while he had created for himself a \nprivate religion. . . .”33 But this was precisely Freud’s bind; as an \nagnostic he had no one to offer his gift to—no one, that is, who had \nany more security of immortality than he did himself. Not even \nmankind itself was secure. As he confessed, the spectre of the \nf dinosaurs still haunts man and will always haunt him.

Well, answers^ Rank, it represents-jon the contrary the \nfurthestjeaSi of the self, the highest idealizationjima-em achieve. \nIt represents the fulfillment of the Agape love-expansion, the \nachievement of the truly creative type. Only in this way, says Rank, \nonly by surrendering to the bigness of nature on the highest, least- \nfetishized level, can man conquer death. In other words, the true \nheroic validation of one’s life lies beyond sex, beyond the other, \nbeyond the private religion—all these are makeshifts that pull man \ndown or that hem him in, leaving him tom with ambiguity. Man \nfeels inferior precisely when he lacks “true inner values in the per- \ni sonality,” when he is merely a reflex of something next to him and \nf has no steadying inner gyroscope, no centering in himself. And in \n\\ order to get such centering man has to look beyond the “thou,” \nI beyond the consolations of others and of the things of this world.36\n\f\nOtto Rank and the Closure of Psychoanalysis on Kierkegaard175\nMan is a “theological being,” concludes Rank, and not a biological \none. In all this it is as though Tillich37 were speaking and, behind \nhim, Kierkegaard and Augustine; but what makes it uncanny in the \npresent world of science is that these are the conclusions~oFtEe life- \nwork oTapsychoanalyst, not a theologian. The net effect of it is \n^overwhelming, and to someone trained narrowly in a field of science \nthe whole thing seems confused. Such a mixture of intensive clinical \ninsight and pure Christian ideology is absolutely heady. One doesn’t \nknow what kind of emotional attitude to assume towards it; it seems \nto pull one in several irreconcilable directions at the same time.\nAt this point the “tough-minded” scientist (as he likes to call \nhimself) slams shut the covers of the book by Rank and turns away \nwitiua^shudder. “What a shame that Freuds closest collaborator \nshould turn so soft in the head, should deliver over to the easy \nconsolations of religion the hard-won knowledge of psychoanalysis .* \nSo he would think—and he would be wrong. Rank made complete \nclosure of psychoanalysis., on KierkegaardT  but helfidliordoTt jmt \nof weakness or wishfulness. He did it j^\ntorTc^pyclioamlytic understanding of man. There is simply no \nwayTor the critic of Rank to get around this. If he thinks Rank is \nnot hard-headed or empirical enough it is because he has not really \ncome to grips with the heart of Rank’s whole work—his elaboration \nof the nature of neurosis. This is Rank’s answer to those who \nimagine that he stopped short in his scientific quest or went soft out \nof personal motives. Rank’s understanding of the neurotic is the key \nto his whole thought. It is of vital importance for a full post- \nFreudian understanding of man and at the same time represents the \nlocus of the intimate merger of Ranks thought with Kierkegaard’s, \non terms and in language that Kierkegaard himself would have \nfound comfortable. Let us explore it in more detail in the next \nchaoter."

If a thinker \nthrows off too many unsystematic and rich insights, there is no \nplace to grab onto his thought. The thing he is trying to illuminate \nseems as elusive as before. It is certain that Freuds prominence is \ndue to no small extent to his ability to make clear, simple, and \nsystematic all of his insights and always to reduce the most complex \ntheory to a few fundamentals. You can do this with Rank too, but \nthe rub is that you must do it yourself by putting your own order \n' into the broadside of Rank's work. Although Rank knew that this \nrequirement wasn’t fair either to the reader or to himself, he never \n,did find anyone to rewrite his books; and so we ourselves have to \ntry to go beyond the confusion of insights and penetrate to the \n/heart of the problem.\nAs a point of departure let us first sum up everything that \nneurosis covers and then take up one thing at a time to show how \nthey all fit together. Neurosis has three interdependent aspects. In\n■  the first place it refers to people who are having trouble livingjyith \nthe truth of existence; it is universal in this sense because every- \njKndy Jhas snme trouble living with the truth of life and pays some \nyjtaLxansoai.tp that truth./In the second place, neurosis is private \nDecause each person fashions his own peculiar stylistic reaction to \nlife. Finally, beyond both of these is perhaps the unique gift of \nRank’s work: that neurosis is also historical to a large extent, because \nI  all the traditional ideologies that disguised and absorbed it have \nfallen away and modern ideologies are just too thin to contain it. So\n• we have modern man: increasingly slumping onto analysts’ couches, \nmaking pilgrimages to psychological guru-centers and joining \ntherapy groups, and filling larger and larger numbers of mental \nhospital beds. Let us look at each of these three aspects in more \ndetail.\nThe Neurotic Type\nFirst, as a problem of personal character. When we say neurosis \nrepresents jhe truth of life .we again mean that lifc is_an overwhelm- \ning problem for an animal free of instinct. The individual has to\n\f\n178 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nprotect himself against the world? and he can do this only as any \nother animal would: by narrowing down the world, shutting off \nexperience, developing an obliviousness both to the terrors of the \nworld and to his own anxieties. Otherwise he would be crippled \nfor action. We cannot repeat too often the great lesson of Freudian \n'psychology: that repression is normal self-protection and creative \nself-restriction—in a real sense, mans natural substitute for instinct. \nRanke  ct, key term for this natural human talent: he calls \nit “partializatijQP” and very rightly sees that life is impossible without \nit. What we call the well-adjusted man has just this capacity to \npartialize the world for comfortable action.2 I have used the term \n“fetishization,” which is exactly the same idea: the “normal” man \nbites off what he can chew and digest of life, and no m<re7TfilTther \nwords, men aren’t built to be gods, to take in the whole world; they \nare built like other creatures, to take in the piece of ground in front \nof their noses. Gods can take in the whole of creation because they \nalone can make sense of it, know what it is all about and for.JBut \nas soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffing \nat eternal problems like life and death, the meaning of a rose or a \nstar cluster—then he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this \ntrouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives \njust as their society maps these problems out for them. These are \nwhat Kierkegaard called the immediate” men and the “Philistines.” \nThey “tranquilize themselves with the trivial”—and so they can \nlead normal lives.\nRight away we can see the immensely fertile horizon that opens \nup in all of our thinking on mental health and “normal” behavior. \nIn order to function normally, man has to achieve from the begin­\nning a serious constriction of the world and of himself. We canjay \nthat the essence of normality is the refusal of reality.3 What we call \nneurosis enters precisely at this point: Some people have more \ntroiiBle with their lies than others. The world is too much with \nthem, and the techniques that they have developed for holding it at \nbay and cutting it down to size finally begin to choke the person \nhimself. This is neurosis in a nutshell: the miscarriage of clumsy lies\nalso see at once that there is no line between normal \nand neurotic, as we all lie and are all bound in some ways by the\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 179\nlies. Neurosis is, then, something we all share; it is universal.4 Or, \nputting it another way, nonfiaTi^is neurosis, and vice versa. We \nI call a man “neurotic” when his lie begins to sliow damaging effects \nI on him or. qp people aroundTiim and he seeks clinical help for it—\n| or Qthi^rs jeek it for him. Otherwise, we call the refusal of reality \n“normal” because it doesn’t occasion any visible problems. It is \nreally as simple as that. After all, if someone who lives alone wants \nto get out of bed a half-dozen times to see if the door is really \nlocked, or another washes and dries his hands exactly three times \nevery time or uses a half-roll of toilet tissue each time he relieves \\ \nhimself—there is really no human problem involved. These people \nare earning their safety in the face of the reality of creatureliness in \nrelatively innocuous and untroublesome ways.\nBut the whole thing becomes more complex when we see how \nthe lies about reality begin to miscarry. Then we have to begin to \napply the label “neurotic.” And there are any number of occasions \nfor this, from many ranges of human experience. Generalhk&peakr \ning, we call neurotic any life style that begins to constript too much, \nthat prevents free forward momentum, new choices, and growth \nthat a person may want and need./For example, a person who is \ntrying to find his salvation only in a love relationship but wha is \nbeing defeated by this too narrow focus is neurotic. He can become \noverly passive and dependent, fearful of venturing out on his own,\n< : of making his life without his partner, no matter how that partner \ntreats him. The.Xihject has become Ju^AU/’ his whole world; and \nhe is reduced to the status of a simple reflex of another human \nbeing.5 This type frequently looks for clinical help. He feels stuck \nin his narrow horizon, needs his particular “beyond” but fears \nmoving past it. In terms we used earlier we could say that his “safe” \nheroics is not working out; it is choking him, poisoning him with \nthe dumb realization that it is so safe that it is not heroic at all. To \nlie to oneself about ones own potential development is another \ncause of guilt. It is one of the most insidious daily inner gnawings \na person can experience. Guilt, remember, is the bind that man ex­\nperiences when he is humbled and stopped in ways that he does not \nunderstand, when he is overshadowed in his energies by the world. \nBut the misfortune of man is that he can experience this guilt in \ntwo ways: as bafflement from without and from within—by being\n\f\nl80 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nstopped in relation to his own potential development. Guilt results \nfrom unused life, from “the unlived in us.”6\n*~«~More sensational are those other familiar miscarriages of lies \nabout reality, what we call obsessions and compulsions^JfSBias of \nall kinds. Here we see the result of too much fetishization or par- \ntialization, too much narrowing-down of the world for action. Jhe \nresult is that the person gets stuck in the narrowness.Jt is one thing \nto ritually wash one’s hands three times; it is another to wash them \nuntil the hands bleed and one is in the bathroom most of the jay.\n™  Here we see in pure culture, as it were, what is at stake in all human \nrepression: the fear of life and death. Safety in the face of the jxal \nterror of creature existence is becoming a real problem for the \nperson. He feels vulnerable—which is the truth! But he reacts too \ntotally, too inflexibly. He fears going out in the street, or up in \nelevators, or into transportation of any kind. At this extreme it is as \nthough the person says to himself “If I do anything at all . .. JUarill \njdieJ’7\nWe can see that the symptom is an attempt to live, an attempt to \nunblock action and keep the world safe. The fear of life and death \nis encapsulated in the symptom. If you feel vulnerable it is because \nyou feel bad and inferior, not big or strong enough to face up to \nthe terrors of the universe. You work out your need for perfection \n(bigness, invulnerability) in the symptom—say, hand-washing or \nthe avoidance of sex in marriage. We might say that the symptom \nitself represents the locus of the performance of heroism. No \nwonder that one cannot jjive it uj): that would release all by itself \nthe whole flood of terror that one is trying to deny and overcome. \nWhen you put all your eggs in one basket you must clutch that \nbasket for dear life. It is as though one were to take the whole \nworld and fuse it into a single object or a single fear. We im­\nmediately recognize this as the same creative dynamic that the \nperson uses in transference, when he fuses all the terror and majesty \nof cre^tiojtL in. the transference-object. This is what Rank meant \nwhen he said that neurosis represents creative power gone astray \nand confusecj. The j^ersQn doesn’t really know what the problem \nis, but he. hits on an ingenious way to keep moving past it. Let us \nnote, too, that Freud himself used the expression “transference- \nneurosis” as a collective term for hysterical fcajs,an4x ^ P u^ s^ on\n\f\nneuroses.8 We can say that Rank and modern psychiatry merely \nsimplify and carry through this basic insight, but now putting the \nburden of explanation on life-and-death fears, not merely on Oedipal \ndynamics. One young psychiatrist has recently summed up the whole \nmatter beautifully, in the following words:\nIt must be clear that the despair and anguish of which the patient com­\nplains is not the result of such symptoms but rather are the reasons for \ntheir existence. It is in fact these very symptoms that shield him from \nthe torment of the profound contradictions that lie at the heart of human \nexistence. The particular phobia or obsession is the ve^m^sJa^uducb \nman . . . eases the burden of his life s tasks . . .  is able to . . . assuage \nKjPsense of insignificance. . . . Thus, neurotic symptoms serve to reduce \nand narrow—to magically transform the world so that he may be dis­\ntracted \"from T5s concerns of death, guilt, and meaninglessness {The \nneurotic preoccupied with his symptom is led to believe that his central \ntask is one of confrontation with his particular obsession or phobia. In a \nsense his neurosis allows him to take control of his destiny—to transform \nthe whole, of liET’me^anmg into the simplified meaning emanating from\nThe ironic thing about the narrowing-down of neurosis is that \nthe person seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so \nmuch of himself and so large a spectrum of his action-world that he \nis actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though \ndead.10 There is just no way for the living creature to avoid life and \ndeath, and it is probably poetic justice that if he tries too hard to \ndo so he destroys himself.\nBut we still haven’t exhausted the range of behaviors that we can \ncall neurotic. Another way of approaching neurosis is from the \nopposite end of the problem. There is a type of person who has \ndifficulty fetishizing and narrowing-down; he has a vivid imagina­\ntion, takes in too much experience, too large a chunk of the world \n—and this too must be called neurotic.11 We introduced this type in \nthe last chapter where we talked about the creative person. We \nsaw that these people feel their isolation, their individuality. They \nstick out, are less built-into normal society, less securely pro­\ngrammed for automatic cultural action. To have difficulty partial- \nizing experience is to have difficulty living. Not to be able to\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 181\n\f\n182 t h e  DENIAL O F  DEATH\nfetishize makes one susceptible to the world as a total problem— \nwith all the living hell that this exposure raises. We said that \npartializing the world is biting off what an animal can chew. Not to \nhave this talent means constantly biting off more than one can chew. \nRank puts it this way:\nThe neurotic type . . . makes the reality surrounding him a part of his \nego, which explains his painful relation to it. For all outside processes, \nhowever unmeaningful they may be in themselves, finally concern him \n... he is bound up in a kind of magic unity with the wholeness of life \naround him much more than the adjusted type who can be satisfied with \nthe role of a part within the whole. The neurotic type has taken into \nhimself potentially the whole of reality.12\nNow we can see how the problem of neurosis can be laid out \nalong the lines of the twin ontological motives: on the one hand, \none merges with the world around him and becomes too much a \npart of it and so loses his own claim to life. On the other hand, one \ncuts oneself off from the world in order to make ones own complete \nclaim and so loses the ability to live and act in the world on its \nterms. As Rank put it, some individuals are unable to separate and \nothers are unable to unite. The ideal of course is to find some \nbalance between the two motives, such as characterize the better \nadjusted person; he is at ease with both. Thejiejirotic represents\nprecisely “aft\n.extreme at one end or the other”; he feels that one or\nthe other is a burden.13\nThe question for a characterology is why some people cannot \nbalance their ontological urges, why they hug at the extremes. The \nanswer must obviously go back to the personal life history. There \nare those who shrink back from experience out of greater life-and- \ndeath anxieties. They grow up not giving themselves freely to the \ncultural roles available to them. They can’t lose themselves thought­\nlessly in the games that others play. One reason is that they have \ntrouble relating to others; they haven’t been able to develop the \n; necessary interpersonal skills. Playing the game of society with auto- \nmatic ease means playing with others without anxiety. If you are \n' not involved in what others take for granted as the nourishment of \n/' their lives, then your own life becomes a total problem. At its ex­\ntreme this describes the schizoid type par excellence. Classically\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis183\nthis state was called the “narcissistic neurosis” or psychosis. The \npsychotic is the one who cannot shut out the world, whose repres­\nsions are all on the surface, whose defenses no longer work; and so \nhe withdraws from the world and into himself and his fantasies. He \nfences himself off and becomes his own world (narcissism).\nIt may seem courageous to take in the whole world, instead of \njust biting off pieces and acting on them, but as Rank points out, \nthis is also precisely a defense against engagement in it:\n. . . this apparent egocentricity originally is just a defense mechanism \nagainst the danger of reality. . . . [The neurotic] seeks to complete his \nego constantly . . . without paying for it.14\n\\ To liveJs to engage jn experience at least partly on the terms of the \n1 experience Jtself. One has to stick his .neck ,outjn the ^cUon_w|thout \nlany guarantees about satisfaction or safety One never knows how it \nwill come out or how silly he willloolc, but the neurotic type wants \nthese guarantees. He doesn’t want to risk his self-image. Rank calls \nthis very aptly the “self-willed over-valuation of self” whereby the \nneurotic tries to cheat nature.15 He won’t pay the price that nature \nwants of him: to age, fall ill or be injured, and die. Instead of \n\\ living experience he ideates it; instead of arranging it in action he \n/ woxks-ltalLoutia.hfe.bead.\nWe can see that neurosis is par excellence the danger of a symbolic \nanimal whose body is a problem to him. Instead of living bio­\nlogically, then, he lives symbolically. Instead of living in the part­\nway that nature provided for he lives in the total way made pos­\nsible by symbols. One substitutes the magical, all-inclusive world of \nthe self for the real, fragmentary world of experience. Again, in this \nj sense, everyone is neurotic, as everyone holds back from life in some \nJ  ways and lets his symbolic world-view arrange things: this is what \ncultural morality is for.16 In this sense, too, the artist is the most \nneurotic because he too takes the world as a totality and makes a \nlargely symbolic problem out of it.\n1 If this neurosis characterizes everyone to a certain extent and \nthe artist most of all, where do we cross the line - into-“neurosisC. as \na clinical problem? One way, as we saw, is by the production qf a \ncriggling symptom or a too:constrigting-Jife.,sfyle. The person has\n\f\n184 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ntried to cheat nature by restricting his experience, but he remains \nsensitive to the terror of life at some level of his awareness. Besides; \nhe can’t arrange his triumph over life and death in his mind or in his \nnarrow heroics without paying some price: the symptom_or a \nbogging down jn guilt and futility because.-Of an unlived life..\n^second way of crossing the line into clinical neurosis follows \nnaturally from everything we have said. Rank asked why the artist \nso often avoids clinical neurosis when he is so much a candidate \nfor it because of his vivid imagination, his openness to the finest and \nbroadest aspects of experience, his isolation from the cultural world­\nview that satisfies everyone else. The answer is that he takes in the \nworld, but instead of being oppressed by it he reworks it in his own \npersonality and recreates it in the work of art. The neurotic is \nprecisely the one who cannot create—the “artiste-manque,” as Rank \nso aptly called him. We might say that both the artist and the \nneurotic bite off more than they can chew, but the artist spews it \nback out again and chews it over in an objectified way, as an ex­\nternal, active, work project. The neurotic can’t marshal this creative \nresponse embodied in a specific work, and so he chokes on his in­\ntroversions. The artist has similar large-scale introversions, but he \nas material.17 In Rank’s inspired conceptualization, the \nis put like this:\n■  . . it is this very fact of the ideologization of purely psychical conflicts \nthat makes the difference between the productive and the unproductive \ntypes, the artist and the neurotic; for the neurotic’s creative power, like \nthe most primitive artist’s, is always tied to his own self and exhausts \nitself in it, whereas the productive type succeeds in changing this purely \nsubjective creative process into an objective one, which means that \nthrough ideologizing it he transfers it from his own self to his work.1^,\nThe neurotic exhausts himself not only in self-preoccupations like \nhypochondriacal fears and all sorts of fantasies, but also in others: \nthose around him on whom he is dependent become his therapeutic \nwork project; he takes out his subjective problems on them. But \npeople are not clay to be molded; they have needs and counter-wills \nof their own. The neurotic’s frustration as a failed artist can’t be \nremedied by anything but an objective creative work of his own. \nAnother way of looking at it is to say that the more totally one takes\n^difference\n\f\nin the world as a problem, the more inferior or “bad” one is going \nto feel inside oneself. He can try to work out this “badness” by \nstriving for perfection, and then the neurotic symptom becomes his \n“creative” work; or he can try to make himself perfect by means of \nhis partner. But it is obvious to us that the only way to work on \nperfection is in the form of an objective work that is fully under \nyour control and is perfectible in some real ways. Either you eat up \nyourself and others around you, trying for perfection; or you ob­\njectify that imperfection in a work, on which you then unleash your \ncreative powers. In this sense, some kind of objective creativity is \nthe only answer man has to the problem of life. In this way he \nsatisfies natnre, which asks that he live and act objectively as a \nvital animal plunging into the world; but he also satisfies his own \ndistinctive human nature because he plunges in on his own symbolic \nterms and not as a reflex of the world as given to mere physical \nsense experience. He takes in the world, makes a total problem out \nof it, and then gives out a fashioned, human answer to that prob­\nlem. This, as Goethe saw in Faust, is the highest that man can \nachieve.\n'“‘TronTt&s point of view the difference between the artist and \nthe neurotic seems to boil down largely to a question of talent. It \nis like the difference between an illiterate schizophrenic and a \nStrindberg: one ends up on the backwards and the other becomes a \nculture hero—but both experience the world in similar ways and \nonly the quality and the power of the reaction differ. If the neurotic \nfeels vulnerable in the face of the world he takes in, he reacts by j \ncriticizing himself to excess. He can’t endure himself or the isolation \nthat his individuality plunges him into. On the other hand, he still \nneeds to be a hero, still needs to earn immortality on the basis of \nhis unique qualities, which means that he still must glorify himself \nin some ways. But he can glorify himself only in fantasy, as he can­\nnot fashion a creative work that speaks on his behalf by virtue of \nits objective perfection. He is caught in a vicious circle because he \nexperiences the unreality of fantasied self-glorification. There is \nreally no conviction possible for man unless it comes from others or \nfrom outside himself in some way—at least not for long. One simply \ncannot justify his own heroism in his own inner symbolic fantasy, \nwhich is what leads the neurotic to feel more unworthy and inferior. \nThis is pretty much the situation of the adolescent who has not dis-\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 185"

The artist, on the other hand, overcomes his \ninferiority and glorifies himself because he has the talent to do so.19\nFrom all this we can see how interchangeably we can talk about \nneurosis, adolescence, normality, the artist—with only varying de­\ngrees of difference or with a peculiar additive like “talent” making \nall the difference. Talent itself is usually largely circumstantial, the \nresult of luck and work, which makes Rank’s view of neurosis true \nto life. Artists are neurotic as well as creative; the greatest of them \ncan have crippling neurotic symptoms and can cripple those around \nthem as well by their neurotic demands and needs. Look what \nCarlyle did to his wife. There is no doubt that creative work is \nitself done under a compulsion often indistinguishable from a purely \nclinical obsession. In this sense, what we call a creative gift is \nmerely the social license to be obsessed. And what we call “cultural \nroutine” is a similar license: the proletariat demands the obsession \nof work in order to keep from going crazy. I used to wonder how \npeople could stand the really demonic activity of working behind \nthose hellish ranges in hotel kitchens, the frantic whirl of waiting \non a dozen tables at one time, the madness of the travel agent’s \noffice at the height of the tourist season, or the torture of working \nI  with a jack-hammer all day on a hot summer street. The answer is \nj so simple that it eludes us: the craziness of these activities is ex-\nI actly that of the human condition.

Rank makes a special \ntype out of the hypersensitive, open neurotic; and if we put him on \nthe schizoid continuum this is probably true. But it is very risky to \ntry to be hard and fast about types of personality; there are all \nkinds of blends and combinations that defy precise compartmental- \nization. After all, one of the reasons we narrow down too much is \nthat we must sense on some level of awareness that life is too big \nand threatening a problem. And if we say that the average man \nnarrows down “just about right,” we have to ask who this average \nman is. He may avoid the psychiatric clinic, but somebody around \nhas to pay for it. We are reminded of those Roman portrait-busts \nthat stuff our museums: to live in this tight-lipped style as an \n..average good citizen must have created some daily hell. Of course \nwe are not talking only about daily pettinesses and the small \nsadisms that are practised on family and friends. Even if the average \nman lives in a kind of obliviousness of anxiety, it is because he has \nerected a massive wall of repressions to hide the problem of life \nand death. His anality may protect him, but all through history it is \nthe “normal, average men” who, like locusts, have laid waste to the \nWQrldinj^dejrJ^oigst^ themselves.\nPerhaps this blending-irToF normalcy and neurosis becomes even \nclearer if we look at the problem not only as one of character but \nalso under another general aspect: as a question of reality and illu­\nsion. Here again Rank has scored a triumph of insight. In terms of \neverything we have said so far, this way of looking at neurosis will \nbe easy to grasp. We have seen that what we call the human \ncharacter is actually a lie about the nature of reality. The causa-sui \nproject is a pretense that one is invulnerable because protected by \nthe power of others and of culture, that one is important in nature \nand can do something about the world. But in back of the causa-sui \nproject whispers the voice of possible truth: that human life may \nnot be more than a meaningless interlude in a vicious drama of \nflesh and bones that we call evolution; that the Creator may not \ncare any more for the destiny of man or the self-perpetuation of \nindividual men than He seems to have cared for the dinosaurs or \nthe Tasmanians. The whisper is the same one that slips incon­\ngruously out of the Bible in the voice of Ecclesiastes: that all is \nvanity, vanity of vanities.\n\f\nSome people are more sensitive to the lie of cultural life, to the \n! illusions of the causa-sui project that others are so thoughtlessly and \n1 trustingly caught up in. The neurotic is having trouble with the \n; balance of cultural illusion and natural reality; the possible horrible \ntruth about himself and the world is seeping into his consciousness. \ns  The average man is at least secure that the cultural game is the \ntruth, the unshakable, durable truth. He can earn his immortality \nin and under the dominant immortality ideology, period. It is all so \nsimple and clear-cut. But now the neurotic:\n[He] perceives himself as unreal and reality as unbearable, because with \nhim the mechanisms of illusion are known and destroyed by self con­\nsciousness. He can no longer deceive himself about himself and disillu­\nsions even his own ideal of personality. He perceives himself as bad, \nguilt laden, inferior, as a small, weak, helpless creature, which is the \ntruth about mankind, as Oedipus also discovered in the crash of his \nheroic fate. All other is illusion, deception, but necessary deception in \norder to be able to bear one’s self and thereby life.20\nIn other words, the neurotic isolates himself from others, cannot \nengage freely in their partialization of the world, and so cannot live \nby their deceptions about the human condition. He lifts himself out \nof the “natural therapy” of everyday life, the active, self-forgetful \nengagement in it; and so the illusions that others share seem unreal \nto him. This is forced.21 Neither can he, like the artist, create new \nillusions. As Anais Nin put it graphically: “The caricature aspect \nof life appears whenever the drunkenness of illusion wears off.”-2 \nAnd don’t some people drink to head off the despair of reality as \n] they sense it truly is? Man must always imagine and believe in a \n\\ “second” reality or a better world than the one that is given him by \n} nature.23 In this sense, the neurotic symptom is a communication \nI about truth: that the illusion that one is invulnerable is a lie. Let \nme quote another piece of Rank’s powerful summing-up of this \nproblem of illusion and reality: \\\nWith the truth, one cannot live. To be able to live one needs illusions, \nnot only outer illusions such as art, religion, philosophy, science and love \nafford, but inner illusions which first condition the outer [i.e., a secure\nl88 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 189\nsense of ones active powers, and of being able to count on the powers of \nothers]. The more a man can take reality as truth, appearance as essence, \nthe sounder, the better adjusted, the happier will he be . . . this con­\nstantly effective process of self-deceiving, pretending and blundering, is \nno psychopathological mechanism. . . .24\nRank calls this a paradoxical but deep insight into the essence \nof neurosis, and he sums it up in the words we have used as an \nepigraph to this chapter. In fact, it is this and more: it absolutely \nshakes the foundations of our conceptualization of normality and \nhealth. It makes them entirely a relative value problem. The neu­\nrotic opts out of life because he is having trouble maintaining his \nillusions about it, which proves nothing less than,that life is possible \nonly with illusions.\nAnd so, the question for the science of mental health must be­\ncome an absolutely new and revolutionary one, yet one that re­\nflects the essence of the human condition: On what level of illusion \n! does one live?.25 We will see the import of this at the close of this \nchapter, but right now we must remind ourselves that when we talk \nabout the need for illusion we are not being cynical. True, there is \n; a great deal of falseness and self-deception in the cultural causa-sui \nproject, but there is also the necessity of this project. Man needs a \n“second” world, a world of humanly created meaning, a new reality \nthat he can live, dramatize, nourish himself in. “Illusion” means \ncreative play at its highest level. Cultural illusion is a necessary \nideology of self-justification, a heroic dimension that is life itself to \ni the symbolic animal. To lose the security of heroic cultural illusion \nis to die—that is what “deculturation” of primitives means and what \nit~3oes. It kills them or reduces them to the animal level of chronic \nfighting and fornication. Life becomes possible only in a continual \nalcoholic stupor. Many of the older American Indians were relieved \nwhen the Big Chiefs in Ottawa and Washington took control and \nprevented them from warring and feuding. It was a relief from the \n1 constant anxiety of death for their loved ones, if not for themselves. \nBut they also knew, with a heavy heart, that this eclipse of their \ntraditional hero-systems at the same time left them as good as \ndead.26\n\f\n190 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nNeurosis as Historical\nOur third general approach to the problem of neurosis is that of \nthe historical dimension. It is the most important of all, really, be­\ncause it absorbs the others. We saw that neurosis could be looked at \nat a basic level as a problem of character and, at another level, as a \nproblem of illusion, of creative cultural play. The historical level is \na third level into which these two merge. The quality of cultural \nplay, of creative illusion, varies with each society and historical \nperiod. In other words, the individual can more easily cross the line \ninto clinical neurosis precisely where he is thrown back on himself \nand his own resources in order to justify his life. Rank could \nvalidly raise the issue of neurosis as a historical problem and not a \nclinical one. If history is a succession of immortality ideologies, then \nthe problems of men can be read directly against those ideologies— \nhow embracing they are, how convincing, how easy they make it for \nmen to be confident and secure in their personal heroism. What \ncharacterizes modern life is the failure of all traditional immortality \nideologies to absorb and quicken mans hunger for self-perpetuation \nand heroism. Neurosis is today a widespread problem because of the \ndisappearance of convincing dramas of heroic apotheosis of man.27 \nThe subject is summed up succinctly in Pinel’s famous observation \non how the Salpetriere mental hospital got cleared out at the time \nof the French Revolution. All the neurotics found a ready-made \ndrama of self-transcending action and heroic identity. It was as \nsimple as that.\nIt begins to look as though modern man cannot find his heroism \nin everyday life any more, as men did in traditional societies just \nby doing their daily duty of raising children, working, and worship­\nping. He needs revolutions and wars and “continuing' revolutions \nto last when the revolutions and wars end. That is the price modern \nman pays for the eclipse of the sacred dimension. When he de­\nthroned the ideas of soul and God he was thrown back hopelessly \non his own resources, on himself and those few around him. Ever! \nlovers and families trap and disillusion us because they are not sub­\nstitutes for absolute transcendence. We might say that they are \npoor illusions in the sense that we have been discussing.-s\n\f\nRank saw that this hyper-self-consciousness had left modern man \n,J to his own resources, and he called him aptly ‘psychological man.” \nIt is a fitting epithet in more than one sense. Modern man became \npsychological because he became isolated from protective collective \nideologies. He had to justify himself from within himself. But he \nalso became psychological because modern thought itself evolved \nthat way when it developed out of religion. The inner life of man \nhad always been portrayed traditionally as the area of the soul. But \nin the 19th century scientists wanted to reclaim this last domain of \nsuperstition from the Church. They wanted to make the inner life of \nman an area free of mystery and subject to the laws of causality.\n<  They gradually abandoned the word “soul” and began to talk about \nthe “self” and to study how it develops in the child’s early relation­\nship with his mother. The great miracles of language, thought, and \nmorality could now be studied as social products and not divine \ninterventions.29 It was a great breakthrough in science that cul­\nminated only with the work of Freud; but it was Rank who saw \nthat this scientific victory raised more problems than it solved. \nScience thought that it had gotten rid forever of the problems of \n;; the soul by making the inner world the subject of scientific analysis. \nBut few wanted to admit that this work still left the soul perfectly \nintact as a word to explain the inner energy of organisms, the \n1 mystery of the creation and sustenance of living matter. It really \ndoesn’t matter if we discover that man’s inner precepts about him­\nself and his world, his very self-consciousness in language, art,\n1 laughter, and tears, are all socially built into him. We still haven’t \nI explained the inner forces of evolution that have led to the develop- \n1. ment of an animal capable of self-consciousness, which is what we \nstill must mean by “soul”—the mystery of the meaning of organismic \n'j awareness, of the inner dynamism and pulsations of nature. From \nthis point of view the hysterical reaction of 19th-century hfilievfirs \nagainst Darwin only shows the ,Xhinness_and imima^atiy.enes§jQf, \ntheir jaith. They were not open to plain and ordinary awe and \nwonder; they took life too much for granted: and when Darwin \n1 strippedjbfiHLof their sense of “special wondrousness they felt as \ngood as dead.\n— t h e triumph of scientific psychology had more equivocal\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 191\n\f\n192 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\neffects than merely leaving intact the soul that it set out to banish. \nWhen you narrow down the soul to the self, and the self to the \nearly conditioning of the child, what do you have left? You have the \nindividual man, and you are stuck with him. I mean that the promise \nof psychology, like all of modern science, was that it would \nusher in the era of the happiness of man, by showing him how \nthings worked, how one thing caused another. Then, when man \nknew the causes of things, all he had to do was to take possession \nof the domain of nature, including his own nature, and his happi­\nness would be assured. But now we come up against the fallacy of \npsychological self-scrutiny that Rank, almost alone among the \ndisciples of Freud, understood. The doctrine of the soul showed \nman why he was inferior, bad, and guilty; and it gave him the \nmeans to get rid of that badness and be happy. Psychology also \nwanted to show man why he felt this way; the hope was that if you \nfound mens motives and showed to man why he felt guilty and bad, \nhe could then accept himself and be happy. But actually psychology \ncould only find part of the reason for feelings of inferiority, bad­\nness, and guilt—the part caused by the objects—trying to be good \nfor them, fearing them, fearing leaving them, and the like. We don’t \nwant to deny that this much is a lot. It represents a great liberation \nfrom what we could call “false badness,” the conflicts artificially \ncaused by ones own early environment and the accidents of birth \nand place. As this research reveals one part of the causa-sui lie, it \ndoes unleash a level of honesty and maturity that puts one more in \ncontrol of oneself and does make for a certain level of freedom and \nthe happiness that goes with it.\nBut now the point that we are driving at: early conditioning and \nconflicts with objects, guilt toward specific persons, and the like are \nonly part of the problem of the person. The causa-sui lie is aimed \nat the whole of nature, not only at the early objects. As the ex­\nistentialists have put it, psychology found out about neurotic guilt \nor circumstantial, exaggerated, unscrutinized personal guilts; but it \ndid not have anything to say about real or natural creature guilt. \nIt tried to lay a total claim on the problem of unhappiness, when it \nhad only a part-claim on the problem.

    "raw_text": ". . . psychology, which is gradually trying to supplant religious and \nmoral ideology, is only partially qualified to do this, because it is a pre­\nponderantly negative and disintegrating ideology. . . .30\nPsychology narrows the cause for personal unhappiness down to \nthe person himself, and then he is stuck with himself. But we know \nthat the universal and general cause for personal badness, guilt, and \ninferiority is the natural world and the persons relationship to it \nas a symbolic animal who must find a secure place in it. All the \nanalysis in the world doesn't allow the person to find out who he is \nand why he is here on earth, why he has to die, and how he can \nmake his life a triumph. It is when psychology pretends to do this, \nwhen it offers itself as a full explanation of human unhappiness, \ntfiat it becomes a fraud that makes the situation of modern man \n*\\n impasse from which he cannot escape. Or, put another way, \npsychology has limited its understanding of human unhappiness to r \nthe personal life-history of the individual and has not understood \nhow much individual unhappiness is itself a historical problem in \nthe larger sense, a problem of the eclipse of secure communal \nideologies of redemption. Rank put it this way:\nIn the neurotic in whom one sees the collapse of the whole human \n, ideology of God it has also become obvious what this signifies psycho­\nlogically. This was not explained by Freuds psychoanalysis which only \ncomprehended the destructive process in the patient from his personal\n■  history without considering the cultural development which bred this \ntype.31\nIf you fail to understand this you risk making the neurotic even \nworse off by closing him off from the larger world-view that he \nneeds. As Rank put it:\n. . .  it was finally the understanding psychoanalyst who sent the self- \nconscious neurotic back to the very self-knowledge from which he wanted \n1 to escape. On the whole, psychoanalysis failed therapeutically because \nit aggravated man s psychologizing rather than healed him of his in­\ntrospection.32\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 193\n\f\n194 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n| Or better, we would say, psychoanalysis failed therapeutically \n| where it fetishized the causes of human unhappiness as sexuality,\nI and when it pretended to be a total world-view in itself. We can \nconclude with Rank that religion is “just as good a psychology” as \nthe psychology that pretended to replace it.33 In some ways it is of \ncourse even better because it gets at the actual causes of universal \nguilt; in some ways it is much worse, because it usually reinforces \nthe parental and social authorities and makes the bind of circum­\nstantial guilt even stronger and more crippling.\nThere is no way to answer Rank's devastating relativization of \nmodern psychology.34 We have only to look around at the growing \nnumber of psychological gurus in the marketplace in order to get the \nlived historical flavor of the thing. Modem man started looking in­\nward in the 19th century because he hoped to find immortality in \na new and secure way. He wanted heroic apotheosis as did all other \nhistorical men—but now there is no one to give it to him except \nhis psychological guru. He created his own impasse. In this sense, \nas Rank said (with what has to be a touch of ironic humor): psy­\nchotherapists “are, so to say, the neurotics product due to his ill­\nness.”35 Modern man needs a “thou” to whom to turn for spiritual \nand moral dependence, and as God was in eclipse, the therapist has \nhad to replace Him—just as the lover and the parents did. For \ngenerations now, the psychoanalysts, not understanding this his­\ntorical problem, have been trying to figure out why the “termination \nof the transference” in therapy is such a devilish problem in many \ncases. Had they read and understood Rank, they would quickly \nhave seen that the “thou” of the therapist is the new God who must \nreplace the old collective ideologies of redemption. As the individual \ncannot serve as God he must give rise to a truly devilish problem.364 \nModern man is condemned to seek the meaning of his life in psy­\nchological introspection, and so his new confessor has to be the\n* One exception is Alan Wheelis, who discusses these very things: the need j \nfor transference, the problem of historical change and neurosis, the insufficiency \nof psychoanalytic therapy for finding an identity, and so on.

As this is so, \nthe patient’s “beyond” is limited to the analytic couch and the \nworld-view imparted there.t\nIn this sense, as Rank saw with such deep understanding, psycho­\nanalysis actually stultifies the emotional life of the patient. Man \nwants to focus his love on an absolute measure of power and value, \nand the analyst tells him that all is reducible to his early condition­\ning and is therefore relative. Man wants to find and experience the \nmarvelous, and the analyst tells him how matter-of-fact everything \nis, how clinically explainable are our deepest ontological motives \nand guilts. Man is thereby deprived of the absolute mystery he \nneeds, and the only omnipotent thing that then remains is the man \nwho explained it away.37 And so the patient clings to the analyst \nwith all his might and dreads terminating the analysis.|\nf If psychology represents the analytic breakdown and dissipation of the \nself and usually limits the world to the scientific ideology of the therapist, we \ncan see some of the reasons Jung developed his own peculiar ideas. His work \nrepresents in part a reaction to the very limitations of psychological analysis. \nFor one thing, he revitalized the inner dimensions of the psyche to secure it \nagainst the self-defeating analytic breakdown of it. He deepened it beyond the \nreaches of analysis by seeing it as a source of self-healing archetypes, of natural \nrenewal, if the patient will only allow it. For another thing, he broadened the \npsyche beyond its individual base, by turning it into a “collective unconscious.” \nNo matter what the individual did to his psyche he was transcended as an \nindividual by it. In these two ways the person could get his heroic justification \nfrom within his own psyche even by analyzing it, in fact, especially by analyz­\ning it! In this way Jung’s system is an attempt to have the advantages of \npsychological analysis and to negate and transcend them at the same time; to \nhave his cake and eat it too. As Rieff has so compellingly argued, dissatisfaction \nwith and criticism of Jung must stem largely from the impossibility of achiev­\ning the psychological redemption of psychological man—as we will conclude \nin Part III (Philip Rieff, The Triumph of the Therapeutic: Uses of Faith After \nFreud [N.Y.: Harper Torchbooks, 1966], Chap. 5).\nI The emotional impoverishment of psychoanalysis must extend also to many \nanalysts themselves and to psychiatrists who come under its ideology.

    "raw_text": "Rank and Kierkegaard: The Merger of Sin and Neurosis\nThe further one pushes his study of Rank the more his writings \nblur into those of Kierkegaard—all the more remarkably, as we \nnow fully appreciate, because of the far greater sophistication of \nclinical psychoanalysis. By now it should be clear that this blurring \nof Rank and Kierkegaard is not a weak surrender to ideology but \nan actual scientific working-through of the problem of human \ncharacter. Both men reached the same conclusion after the most \nexhaustive psychological quest: that at the very furthest reaches of \nscientific description, psychology has to give way to “theology”— \nthat is, to a world-view*tBaf“aBsorBs the mdivIduaTTconflicts and \nguilt and offers him the possibility for some kind of heroic apothe­\nosis. Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate \nit into meaningfulness on the largest possible level. Here Rank and \nKierkegaard meet in one of those astonishing historical mergers of \nthought: that sin and neurosis are two ways of talking about the \nsame thing—the complete isolation of the individual, his dis­\nharmony with the rest of nature, his hyperindividualism, his attempt \nto create his own world from within himself. Both sin and neurosis \nrepresent t^indmdwalblp.wing himself up to larger than his true \nsizeTlJiT refusal to recognize his cosmic dependence. Neurosis, like \nsint is an attempt to force nature, to pretend that the causa-sui \nproject really suffices. In sin and neurosis man fetishizes himself on \nj something narrow at hand and pretends that the whole meaning \nand miraculousness of creation is limited to that, that he can get his \nbeatificatiminDm..thgt,38\n■ ' \"‘ Rank’s summing-up of the neurotic world-view is at the same time \nthat of the classic sinner:\nThe neurotic loses every kind of collective spirituality, and makes the \nheroic gesture of placing himself entirely within the immortality of his \nown ego, as the observations and cosmic fantasies of psychotics so clearly \nshow.39\nBut we know that this attempt is doomed to failure because man \nsimply cannot justify his own heroism; he cannot fit himself into his \nown cosmic plan and make it believable. He must live with agoniz-\n196 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 197\ning doubts if he remains in touch at all with the larger reality. Only \nwhen he loses this touch do the doubts vanish—and that is the \ndefinition of psychosis: a wholly unreal belief- in the selFJustfficatiGiv \nof cosmic heroism. “I am Christ.” In this sense, as Rank said, neu­\nrosis represents the striving for an “individual religion,” a self- ! \nachieved immortality.40 ——^\nSin and neurosis have another side: not only their unreal self­\ninflation in the refusal to admit creatureliness but also a penalty \nfor intensified self-consciousness: the failure to be consoled by \nshared illusions. The result is that the sinner (neurotic) is hyper­\nconscious of the very thing he tries to deny: his creatureliness, his \nmiserableness and unworthiness.41 The neurotic is thrown back on \nhis true perceptions of the human condition, which caused his isola­\ntion and individuation in the first place. He tried to build a glorified \nprivate inner world because of his deeper anxieties, but life takes \nits revenge. The more he separates and inflates himself, the more \nanxious he becomes. The more he artificially idealizes himself, the \nmore exaggeratedly he criticizes himself. He alternates between the \nextremes of “I am everything” and “I am nothing.”42 But it is clear \nthat if one is going to be >part of\nsomething else. There is no way to avoid paying the debt of de- \n“pendency and yielding to the larger meaning of the rest of nature, \nto the toll of suffering and the death that it demands; and there is \nno way to justify this payment from within oneself, no matter how \nmightily one tries.\nBut now we see the historical difference between the classical \nsinner and the modem neurotic: both of them experience the \nnaturalness of human insufficiency, only today the neurotic is stripped \nof the symbolic world-view, the God-ideology that would make \nsense out of his unworthiness and would translate it into heroism. \nTraditionalreligion turned the consciousness of sin into a condition \nfor salvation but the tortured sense of nothingness of the neurotic \nqualifies him now only for miserable extinction. for~merciful release \n-\"“In lonely death. It is all right to be nothing vis-a-vis God, who alone \ncan make it right in His unknown ways; it is another thing to be \nnothing to oneself, who is nothing. Rank summed it up this way:\nThe neurotic type suffers from a consciousness of sin just as much as did\n\f\nj!. I|, his religious ancestor, without believing in the conception of sin. This is \n\\ precisely what makes him “neurotic”; he feels a sinner without the reli- \nI gious belief in sin for which he therefore needs a new rational explana­\ntion.43\ni\nThus the plight of modem man: a sinner with no word for it or, \nworse, who looks for the word for it in a dictionary of psychology \nand thus only aggravates the problem of his separateness and hyper­\nconsciousness. Again, this impasse is what Rank meant when he \ncalled psychology a preponderantly negative and disintegrating \nideology.”\nHealth as an Ideal\nWe have now covered the three aspects of the problem of neu­\nrosis: as a result of character-formation, as a problem of reality \nversus illusion, and as a result of historical circumstances. All three \nof course merge into one. Man lives his contradictions for better or \nworse.in 5Qme kind of cultural project in a given historical penod. \nNeurosis is another word for the total problem of the human condi­\ntion; it becomes a clinical word when the individual bogs down in \nthe face of the problem—when his heroism is in doubt or becomes \nself-defeating. Men are naturally neurotic and always have been, \nbut at some times they have it easier than at others to mask their \ntrue condition. Men avoid clinical neurosis when they can trustingly \nlive their heroism in some kind of self-transcending drama. Modern \nman lives his contradictions for the worse, because the modern con­\ndition is one in which convincing dramas of heroic apotheosis, of \ncreative play, or of cultural illusion are in eclipse. There is no em­\nbracing world-view for the neurotic to depend on or merge with to \nmask his problems, and so the “cure” for neurosis is difficult in our \nJims.44 ‘\" *\nThis is Rank’s devastating Kierkegaardian conclusion: if neurosis \nis sin, and not disease, then the only thing which can “cure” \nworld-view, some kmd oLaffirmative collective ideology m whjch \nthe person can perform the living drama of his acceptance as a \ncreature. Only in this way can the neurotic come out of his isolation\n{ 1<$ THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis199\nto become part of such a larg€rg.nd higher wholeness as religiqn \nhas always represented. In anthropology we called these the myth- \nritual complexes of traditional society. Does the neurotic lack some­\nthing outside him to absorb his need for perfection? Does he eat \nhimself up with obsessions? The myth-ritual complex is a social \nform tor the channelling of obsessions. We might say that it places \ncreative obsession within the reach of everyman, which is precisely \nthe function of ritual. This function is what Freud saw when he \ntalked about the obsessive quality of primitive religion and com­\npared it to neurotic obsession. But he didn’t see how natural this \nwas, how all social life is the obsessive ritualization of control in \none way or another. It automatically engineers safety and banishes \ndespair by keeping people focussed on the noses in front of their \nfaces. The defeat of despair is not mainly an intellectual problem \nfor an active organism, but a problem of self-stimulation via move­\nment. Beyond a given point man is not helped by more “knowing,” \nbut only by living and doing in a partly self-forgetful way. As \nGoethe put it, we must plunge into experience and then reflect on \nthe meaning of it. All reflection and no plunging drives jus...xnad: all \nplunging and no reflection, and we are brutes. Goethe wrote \nmaxims like these precisely at the time when the individual lost the \nprotective cover of traditional society and daily life became a prob­\nlem for him. He no longer knew what were the proper doses of \nexperience. This safe dosage of life is exactly what is prescribed by \ntraditional custom, wherein all the important decisions of life and \neven its daily events are ritually marked out. Neurosis is the con­\ntriving of private obsessional ritual to replace fhe sociaHy-agreetl \none now lost by the demise of traditional society. The customs and \nmyths of traditional society provided a whole interpretation of the \nmeaning of life, ready-made for the individual; all he had todQJvas.. \nto accept living it as true.

What typifies the neurotic is that he \n“knows” his situation vis-a-vis reality. He has no doubts; there is \nnothing you can say to sway him, to give him hope or trust. He is a \nmiserable animal whose body decays, who will die, who will pass \ninto dust and oblivion, disappear forever not only in this world but \nin all the possible dimensions of the universe, whose life serves no \nconceivable purpose, who may as well not have been born, and so \non and so forth. He knows Truth and Reality, the motives of the \nentire universe.\nIt was G. K. Chesterton who kept alive the spirit of Kierkegaard \nand naive Christianity in modern thought, as when he showed with \nsuch style that the characteristics the modern mind prides itself on^ \nare precisely thosejaf.madness.46 There is no one more logicaTthan \nTEE^lunatic, more concerned with the minutiae of cause and effect. \nMadmen are the greatest reasoners we know, and that trait is one \n\"oTfhe accompaniments of their undoing. All their vital processes are \nsBrunken into the mind. What is the one thing they lack that-sane \ngaen possess? The ability to be careless, to~disregardM ,appearances, \ntorelax and laugh at the wpilcL, They cant unbend, can’t gamble \ntheir whole existence, as did Pascal, on a fanciful wager. They can t \ndo what religion has always asked: to betevejn^a4u^icatl0n \ntEeir lives that seems absurd. The neurotic knows better: he is the \n' aSsurd, but nothing else is absurd; it is ‘only too true.” But faith \nasks that man expand himself trustingly into the nonlogical, into the \ntruly fantastic. This spiritual expansion is the one thing that modern \n' man finds most difficult, precisely because he is constricted into \nhimself and has nothing to lean on, no collective drama that makes \ni fantasy seem real because it is lived and shared.\nLet me hasten to assure the reader that I am not developing an \napologia for traditional religion but only describing the impoverish- \n? ment of the modern neurotic and some of the reasons for it. I want \nto give some background for understanding how centrally Rank \nhimself stands in the tradition of Pascal, Kierkegaard, and Chester­\nton on the problem of faith and illusion or creative play. As we have \nlearned from Huizinga and more recent writers like Josef Pieper and \nHarvey Cox, the only secure truth men have is that whjfihJhey \ntjjemselves create~aiTd dramatize; to live is to play at the meaning \n; of liferTKe^ upsKot of this whole tfiadlBon^ of thought is that it\n\f\n202 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nteaches us once and for all that childlike foolishness is the calling of \nmature men. Just this way Rank prescribed the cure for neurosis: \nas the “need for legitimate foolishness.”47 The problem of the union \npf religion, psychiatry, awd social science is contained in this one \nformjjja^\nWe said earlier that the question of human life is: on what level \nof illusion does one live? This question poses an absolutely new \nquestion for the science of mental health, namely: What is the ‘‘best” \nillusion under which to live? Or, what is the most legitimate foolish­\nness? If you are going to talk about life-enhancing illusion, then you \ncan truly try to answer the question of which is “best.” You will \nhave to define “best” in terms that are directly meaningful to man, \nrelated to his basic condition and his needs. I think the whole ques­\ntion would be answered in terms of how much freedom, dignity, \nand hope a given illusion provides. These three things absorb the \nproblem of natural neurosis and turn it to creative living.\nWe have to look for the answer to the problem of freedom where \nit is most absent: in the transference, the fatal and crushing en­\nslaver of men. The transference fetishizes mystery, terror, and \npower; it holds the self bound in its grip. Religion answers directly \nto the problem of transference by expanding awe and terror to the \ncosmos where they belong. It also takes the problem of self-justifica- \ntion and removes it from the objects near at hand. We no longer \nhave to please those around us, but the very source of creation— \nthe powers that created us, not those into whose lives we ac­\ncidentally fell. Our life ceases to be a reflexive dialogue with the \nstandards of our wives, husbands, friends, and leaders and becomes \ninstead measured by standards of the highest heroism, ideals truly \nfit to lead us on and beyond ourselves. In this way we fill ourselves \nwith independent values, can make free decisions, and, most im­\nportantly, can lean on powers that really support us and do not \noppose us.48 The personality can truly begin to emerge in religion \nJbecause God, as an abstraction, does not oppose the individual as \nothers do, but instead provides the individual with all the powers \nnecessary for independent self-justification. What greater security \nthan to lean confidently on God. on the Fount of creation, the most \nterrifying power of all? If God is hidden and intangible, all the \nbetter: that allows man to expand and develop by himself.\n\f\nThe problem of transference is thus—like all things human— \npartly a value problem, a question of ideals. Freud tried to keep it \nwholly scientific by showing how exaggerated and false transference \nperceptions of reality were, which to a great extent is of course \ntrue. But what is the norm of “true” perception? Here Freud him­\nself had to hedge. What is more unreal than the perceptions of a \nnormal person in love, who is carried into rapture and expansion \nof being by his very exaggerations?49 Van der Leeuw, that great \npsychologist of religion, saw the problem of transference introjec- \ntions more broadly than Freud. He cites an ancient Egyptian text \nin which a certain Paheri discusses his inner conscience as the \nvoice of God dwelling within man; and then Van der Leeuw says:\nNow it is possible, certainly, with Nietzsche and Freud, to ascribe the \n\"strangeness” of the voice, which warns us to avoid, to infantilism; \n\"not the voice of God in the heart of man, but the voice of some men in \nman” [says Nietzsche].\nBut Van der Leeuw concludes on a surprising note: “We may how­\never prefer the Egyptian description; on this point phenomenology \nhas no decision to make.”50 In other words, we may prefer it for the \nlarger expansiveness of being that it represents, as more imagina­\ntively it links the person with higher mysterious powers. God- \nconsciousness is not only regressive transference but also creative \npossibility. But unlike Van der Leeuw we are arguing that on this \nmatter psychology does have a decision to make: it can talk about \nless-constricting forms of transference.\nBest of all, of course, religion solves the problem of death, which \nno living individuals can solve, no matter how they would support \nus. Religion, then, gives the possibility of heroic victory in freedom \nand solves the problem of human dignity at its highest level. The \ntwo ontological motives of the human condition are both met: the \nneed to surrender oneself in full to the rest of nature, to become a \npart of it by laying down one’s whole existence to some higher \nmeaning; and the need to expand oneself as an individual heroic \npersonality. Finally, religion alone gives hopeja^ausj^tjw^^ \njhe dimension of the TXfiktYO W ri and the unknowable, the fantastic \nmystery of creation that the human mind cannot even begin to\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 203\n\f\n204 THE DENIAL of  death\napproach, the possibility of a multidimensionality of spheres of ex­\nistence, of heavens and possible embodiments that make a mockery \nof earthly logic—and in doing so, it relieves the absurdity of earthly \nlife, all the impossible limitations and frustrations of living matter.\n(\nIn religious terms, to “see God” is to die, because the creature is \ntoo small and finite to be able to bear the higher meanings of \ncreation. Religion takes ones very creatureliness, one’s insignifi­\ncance, and makes it a condition of hope. Full transcendence of the \nhuman condition means limitless possibility unimaginable to us.51\nWhat is the ideal for mental health, then? A lived, compelling \nillusion that does not lie about life, death, and reality; one honest \nenough to follow its own commandments: I mean, not to kill, not to \ntake the lives of others to justify itself. Rank saw Christianity as a \ntrutly great ideal foolishness in the sense that we have been dis­\ncussing it: a childlike trust and hope for the human condition that \nleft open the realm of mystery. Obviously, all religions fall far \nshort of their own ideals, and Rank was talking about Christianity \nnot as practiced but as an ideal. Christianity, like all religions, has \nin practice reinforced the regressive transference into an even more \nchoking bind: the fathers are given the sanction of divine authority. \nBut as an ideal, Christianity, on all the things we have listed, stands \nhigh, perhaps even highest in some vital ways, as people like \nKierkegaard, Chesterton, the Niebuhrs, and so many others have \ncompellingly argued.52 The curious thing—as we can now fully \nappreciate—is that Rank, after a lifetime of work, drew the circle of \npsychoanalysis itself on this tradition of thought. In this he stands \nside by side with Jung, as Progoff so well showed.53 II\n|| There are many other names one could mention in the synthesis of psy­\nchoanalytic, existential, and theological thought. We have already noted Wald- \nman’s work, which carries the synthesis all the way back to Adler, as Progoff \nalso showed. Thus we are not talking about an accidental convergence or un­\nusual similarity but about a solid cumulative achievement of several major \nstrands of thought. Igor A. Carusos important book Existential Psychology: \nFrom Analysis to Synthesis (New York: Herder and Herder, 1964) is an \nexcellent “Rankian” statement on neurosis. See also Wilfried Daim, “On Depth- \nPsychology and Salvation,” Journal of Psychotherapy as a Religious Process, \n1955, a: 24-37, for another part of the modem movement of the closure of \npsychoanalysis on Kierkegaard. One of the first modem attempts in this direc- \ntion—perhaps the first—was that of Freud’s friend the Reverend Oskar Pfister,\n\f\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 205\nFinally, if mental health is a problem of ideal illusion, we are . \nl^w iffr^m T I^ human character If\nwe are^lEKg^aBout the “best” ideal, then we should also talk \nabout the costs of lesser ideals. What is the toll taken on the human \npersonality by a failure to fully meet the twin ontological needs of \nman? Again we are back to the problem of Freud’s life: what is the \ncost of the denial of absolute transcendence, of the attempt to \nfabricate one’s own religion? When a man fails to draw the powers \nof his existence from the highest source, what is the cost to him­\nself and those around him? We haven’t even begun to discuss ques­\ntions like this in characterology, but it seems to me that they are \nbasic and necessary, the key questions, without which we cannot \neven talk about mental health intelligently. Rank posed the basic \nquestion: he asked whether the individual is able at all “to affirm \nand accept himself from himself.” But he quickly sidestepped it by \nsaying that it “cannot be said.” Only the creative type can do this\nwho wrote a massive work on anxiety, translated as Christianity and Fear \n(London: Allen and Unwin, 1948). It took anxiety as a mainspring of conduct \nfrom John through Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Freud; his intent was to show \nthat anxiety is best overcome through the immortality ideology of Christian \nlove. This is not the place to assess Pfister's extensive study and argument, \nbut it is important to note that the work is vitiated by a curious failure to \nunderstand that the anxiety of life and death is a universal characteristic of \nman. He sides with those who believe that a healthy development of the child \ncan take place without guilt, and that a full expression of love can banish fear: \n. . nor is it true that this pre-disposition to fear must necessarily be called \ninto play by existence in the world as such. . . . That existence in the world as \nsuch causes fear is true only of persons who have been disposed to fear by \nvarious ‘dammings’. ...” (p. 49). He says that Kierkegaard had a fear neurosis \nbased on his difficult childhood—hence his morbidity. The curious thing is that \nPfister failed to get behind the cultural immortality ideology that absorbs and \ntransmutes fear, even while he recognized it: “Many persons, not only children \nand the aged, find it possible to face death. They may even welcome it as a \nfriend and be ready to die for a great cause.” Ibid. This is true but, as we \nnow know, it is also trivial because it does not come to grips with the trans­\nference transmutations of reality and power. The result is a book that offers a \nsort of Wilhelm Reich-Norman Brown thesis of the possibilities of unrepressed \n' living, with Christ as the focus for Eros. All of which leads to the rumination \n' that when liberal Christianity seizes upon Freud to try to make the world the \ncheerfully “right place,” such unusual partners in such an un-Christian venture \nare bound to produce something false.\n\f\n206 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nto some extent, he reasoned, by using his work as a justification for \nhis existence.54 I myself have posed this question as a central one \nfor the science of man, in ignorance of the work of Rank.55 I think \nit can be answered as Rank himself elsewhere answered it, as we \nsaw in the last chapter: even the creative type should ideally sur­\nrender to higher powers than himself.56 It was Jung, with his \nanalytical penetration, who saw also the reason, which is that the \nunusual person takes his transference projections back into himself. \nAs we said in the last chapter, one reason for his creativity is that \nhe sees the world on his own terms and relies on himself. But this \nleads to a dangerous kind of megalomania because the individual \nbecomes too full with his own meanings. Furthermore, if you don’t \nfetishize the world by transference perceptions, totalities of ex­\nperience put a tremendous burden on the ego and risk annihilating \nit. The creative person is too full both of himself and of the world.57 \nAgain, as the creative person has the same personality problems as \nthe neurotic and the same biting off of the wholeness of experience, \nhe needs some kind of resolution in a new and greater dependency \n—ideally, a freely chosen dependency, as Rank said.\nAs we saw so poignantly with Freud, the strongest among us \nfaint away like children when pushed to take the whole meaning \nof life on themselves, to support it with their own meager creature \npowers. We said at the end of Chapter Six that Freud couldn’t take \nthe step from scientific to religious creatureliness. As Jung under­\nstood only too well, that would have meant Freud’s abandoning of \nhis own peculiar passion as a genius. Jung must have understood \nit from within his own experience: he himself could never bring \nhimself to visit Rome because—as he admitted—Rome raised ques­\ntions “which were beyond my powers to handle. In my old age— \nin 1949—I wished to repair this omission, but was stricken with a \nfaint while I was buying tickets. After that, the plans for a trip \nto Rome were once and for all laid aside.”58 What are we to make \nof all these giants fainting at the prospect of what to us seems simple \ntourism? Freud, too, had not been able to visit Rome until later in \nlife and turned back each time he approached the city.\nI think we can fully understand this problem now that we have \ndiscussed Rank’s closure on Kierkegaard, especially his psychology \nof the artist. These men had problems that no simple tourist knows:"

    "raw_text": "they were innovators who tried to give a whole new meaning to \ncreation and history, which meant that they had to support and \njustify all previous meanings and all possible alternative ones on \ntheir shoulders alone. Probably Rome epitomized these meanings \nin herself, her ruins and her history, and so she made their legs \nquiver. How much human blood was soaked into her soil; how \nmany human dramas were played out there with what must seem, \nin the perspective of history, such unfeeling and extravagant waste­\nfulness? It raises a problem just like that of the dinosaurs that \ntroubled Freud or of the deformed infants that mocked Luther, \nonly now on the level of all human beings. We mentioned in \nChapter Six that when Freud himself came to analyze his reluc­\ntances about Rome and his strange experience on the Acropolis, he \nsaw that somehow the memory of his father stood in judgment of \nhis own achievements; he said he was troubled by a feeling of \n“piety” for him. I think if we push the analysis to its ultimate \npoint we have to say that each earthly father accuses us of our \nimpotence if we become truly creative personalities; they remind \nus that we are born of men and not gods. No living person can give \ngemu the powers it needs to shoulder the meaning of the world.\nYet, what are we to say about this problem if even Jung, who \nalways relied on God, could still faint away with the burden of \nlife? Probably in the last analysis only this: that all men are here to \nuse themselves up and the problem of ideal illusion doesn’t spare \nany man from that. It only addresses the question of the best \nquality of work and life that men can achieve, depending on the \nbeliefs they have and the powers they lean on. And this subject, as \nwe said, is a matter for discussion by the empirical science of psy­\nchology itself. We have to reason about the highest actualization \nthat man can achieve. At its ultimate point the science of psy­\nchology meets again the questioning figure of Kierkegaard. What \nworld-view? What powers? For what heroism?\nThe Present Outcome of Psychoanalysis 207"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER TEN\nA General View of Mental illness\n. . . the essential, basic arch-anxiety (primal \nanxiety) [is] innate to all isolated, individual \nforms of human existence. In the basic anxiety \nhuman existence is afraid of as well as anxious \nabout its “being-in-the-world*. . . . Only if we \nunderstand.. . [this can we] conceive of the \nseemingly paradoxic phenomenon that people \nwho are afraid of living are also \nespecially frightened of death.\n—M edard Boss1\nI remember one of my college professors—a man very much ad­\nmired as a teacher of medieval history—confessing that the more \nhe learned about the period the less he was prepared to say: the \nepoch was so complex, so diversified that no general statement \ncould safely be made about it. The same thing can surely be said \nabout the theory of mental illness. How dare someone try to write \na chapter entitled “A general view” of such a complex and varied \nphenomenon—especially someone who is not himself a psychiatrist? \nIn fact, I have had an unusually difficult time forcing myself to sit \ndown and write this chapter, even though I feel it belongs in the \nbook. The literature is there for all to see: the record of lifetimes \nof work by some of the greatest psychologists who ever lived, men \npossessing the richest personal sensitivities, work reflecting unusual \ntheoretical gifts and based on the most extensive and varied clinical \nmaterials. Why should someone try to rake this area over again, in \nwhat can only be a superficial and simple-minded way?\nProbably for that very reason: today we need simple-mindedness\n208\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 209\nin order to be able to say anything at all; this is the other side of \nthe coin of the confession of the medievalist. The great character­\nistic of our time is that we know everything important about human \nnature that there is to know. Yet never has there been an age in \nwhich so little knowledge is securely possessed, so little a part of \nthe common understanding. The reason is precisely the advance of \nspecialization, the impossibility of making safe general statements, \nwhich has led to a general imbecility. What I would like to do in \nthese few pages is to run the risk of simple-mindedness in order to \nmake some dent in the unintended imbecility brought about by \nspecialization and its mountains of fact. Even if I succeed only \npoorly, it seems like a worthwhile barter. In such a stifling and \ncrushing scientific epoch someone has to be willing to play the fool \nin order to relieve the general myopia.\nRight away the expert' wilTs^TTEat it is presumptuous to talk \nabout a general theory of mental illness, that this is something far \nin the future, a distant and perhaps unattainable goal—as if we \ndidn t already have such a theory securely lodged in the countless \nvolumes that crowd our libraries and bookstores. The gigantic \nfigures of modern psychology have given us a thorough under­\nstanding of human behavior in both its neurotic and psychotic as­\npects, as well as its perversions of all types. The problem is, as we \nsaid, how to put some kind of general order into this wealth of \ninsight and knowledge. One way is to make the most general state­\nments about it, the same kind of statements that we have used so \nfar in this book to tie together diverse areas of fact. Is man an \nanimal who fears death, who seeks self-perpetuation and heroic \ntranscendence of his fate? Then, failure for such an animal is failure \nto achieve heroic transcendence. As Adler put it so succinctly in the \nepigraph we have borrowed for this part of the book, mental illness \nis a way of talking about people who have lost courage, which is \nthe same as saying that it reflects the failure of heroism. This con­\nclusion follows logically from the discussion of the problem of neu­\nrosis in the previous chapter. We saw there that the neurotic was \none who especially could not stand his own creatureliness, who \ncouldn’t surround his anality with convincing illusion. It was Adler \nwho saw that low self-esteem was the central problem of mental \nlUnessTWhen does the person have the most trouble with his self-\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\nesteem? Precisely when his heroic transcendence of his fate is most \nin doubt, when he doubts his own immortality, the abiding value \nof his life; when he is not convinced that his having lived really \nmakes any cosmic difference. From this point of view we might \n\\ well say that mental illness represents styles of bogging-down in the \n\\denial of creatureliness.\nDepression\nWe would not get very far with general statements like these if \nwe could not show how they sum up the specifics of each syndrome. \nFortunately, we can do just that. Adler had already revealed how \nperfectly depression or melancholia is a problem of courage; how \nit develops in people who are afraid of life, who have given up \nany semblance of independent development and have been totally \nimmersed in the acts and the aid of others.2 They have lived lives of \n“systematic self-restriction,” and the result is that the less you do the \nless you can do, the more helpless and dependent you become. The \nmore you shrink back from the difficulties and the darings of life, \nthe more you naturally come to feel inept, the lower is your self- \nevaluation. It is ineluctable. If one’s life has been a series of “silent \nretreats/’3 one ends up firmly wedged into a comer ancj has nowhere \nj  else to retreat. This state is the bogging-down of depression, Fear \n1 of life leads to excessive fear of death, as Boss tooreirunds us in the \nepigraph we have borrowed for this chapter. Finally, one doesn’t \ndare to move—the patient lies in bed for days on end, not eating, \nletting the housework pile up, fouling the bed. .\nThe moral of this example of failure of courage is that in some \nway one must pay with life and consent daily to die, to give oneself \nup to the risks and dangers of the world, allow oneself to be en­\ngulfed and used up. Otherwise one ends up as though dead in try­\ning to avoid life and death. This is how modern existentialist psy­\nchiatrists understand depression, exactly as Adler did at the \nbeginning of this century. Medard Boss sums it up in a few lines:\nIt is always the whole existence of the melancholic patient which has \nfailed to take over openly and responsibly all those possibilities of relat­\ning to the world which actually would constitute his own genuine self.\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 211\nConsequently, such an existence has no independent standing of its own \nbut continually falls prey to the demands, wishes and expectations of \nothers. Such patients try to live up to these foreign expectations as best \nthey can, in order not to lose the protection and love of their surround­\nings. [But they go more deeply into debt.] Hence the terrible guilt feel­\nings of the melancholic . . . derive from his existential guilt.4\nThe interesting scientific question here is why we have had so \nmuch trouble getting agreement on the simple dynamics of depres­\nsion, when it had been revealed so early and so lucidly by Adler and \nnow again by the school of existential psychiatry. One of the reasons \nis that the dynamics are not so simple as they appear. They go very \ndeeply into the heart of the human condition, and we have not been \nable to read this heart in any straightforward or easy way. For one \nthing, we ourselves had so effectively banished the idea of the fear \nof death and life; we were not sufficiently impressed by the terror \nof the living creature; and so we could not understand the torturings \nand turnings of anguished people who were jerked about by these \nterrors. For example, despite Adler’s excellent and early general \ntheory, he put us off somewhat by talking about the selfishness and \nthe pamperedness of the depressed person, the “spoiled child” who \nrefuses to grow up and accept the responsibility for his life, and so \non. Of course these things are true to some extent, and Adler fully \nrealized that nature herself had made man a weakling in the animal \nkingdom. But the accent is important. Adler shouldLhav€L§tress.ed \nmore the sheer terror ofindividuation* of difference, of being alone, \nof losing support and delegated power. He revealed to us the “life- \nhe” that people use in order to live, but we tended to overlook how \nnecessary this lie is in some form or other for most men; how men \nsimply do not have their own powers to rely on. When we remind \nourselves again how giants like Freud and Jung shrink and faint \nwhile buying simple travel tickets, perhaps we can get some correct \nfeeling for the magnitude of the task of poor Mr. Average Man| \njust daily trying to negotiate a semblance of tranquil heroism by \nembedding himself in the powers of others. When these tactics fail \nand he is threatened with the exposure of his life-lie, how logical it \nis that he give way to his own version of fainting by bogging down \nin a depressive withdrawal.\n\f\n212 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nAnother complexity of the dynamics of depression that we over­\nlooked was the one that Rank taught us; the urge to immortaliza­\ntion and self-perpetuation by pleasing the other, by conforming to \nthe code of behavior that he represents.5 People hunger for im­\nmortality and get it where they can: in the small family circle or in \nthe single love object. The transference object is the locus of our \nconscience, of our whole cosmology of good and evil. It is not some­\nthing we can simply break away from, as it embodies our whole \nhero-system. We saw how complete and complex the transference \ncan be. We obey our authority figures all our lives, as Freud \nshowed, because of the anxiety of separation. Every time we try to \ndo something other than what they wanted, we awaken the anxiety \nconnected with them and their possible loss. To lose their powers \nand approval is thus to lose our very lives. Also, we saw that the \ntransference object in itself embodies the mysterium tremendum of \nexistence. It is the primary miracle. In its concrete existence it tran­\nscends mere symbolic commands, and what is more natural than \nconforming to this miraculousness? We must add, with Rank, what \nis more natural than continuing to strive for immortality by fulfilling \nthe moral code represented by the object? Transference is the posi­\ntive use of the object for eternal self-perpetuation. This explains \nthe durability of transference and its strength, even after the death \nof the object: “I am immortal by continuing to please this object \nwho now may not be alive but continues to cast a shadow by what \nit has left behind and may even be working its powers from the \ninvisible spirit world.” This is a part of the psychology of ancient \nancestor worshippers as well as of modems who continue to live \naccording to family codes of honor and conduct.\nDepression, then, sums up both the terror of life and death and \nthe hunger for self-perpetuation; how heroic can one get? It is so \nnatural to try to be heroic in the safe and small circle of family or \nwith the loved one, to give in to a “silent retreat” now and then \nto keep this heroics secure. How many people have an independent \ngift to give to the cosmos in order to assure their special im­\nmortality? Only the creative person can manage that. When the \naverage person can no longer convincingly perform his safe heroics \nor cannot hide his failure to be his own hero, then he bogs down \nin the failure of depression and its terrible guilt. I particularly like\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 213\nGaylins insight that the bogging-down into total helplessness and \ndependency in depression is itself the last and most natural defense \navailable to the mammalian animal:\nDependency is the basic survival mechanism of the human organism.\n. . . When the adult gives up hope in his ability to cope and sees him­\nself incapable of either fleeing or fighting, he is “reduced” to a state of \ndepression. This very reduction with its parallel to the helplessness of \ninfancy becomes . . .  a plea for a solution to the problem of survival via \ndependency. The very stripping of one’s defenses becomes a form of de­\nfensive maneuver.6\nBoss says that the terrible guilt feelings of the depressed person \nare existential, that is, they represent the failure to live one’s own \nlife, to fulfill one’s own potential because of the twisting and turn­\ning to be “good” in the eyes of the other. The other calls the tune \nto one’s eligibility for immortality, and so the other takes up one’s \nunlived life. Relationship is thus always slavery of a kind, which \nleaves a residue of guilt. A modern therapist like Frederick Peris \nactively worked against this tyranny by reminding his patients that \n“they were not in the world to please their partner, nor he to please \nthem.” It was a way of cutting into the morality of “personal-per- \nformance for immortality.” All this is very good, but it can hardly \nsum up all the guilt that the patient feels, or at least accuses him­\nself of. To judge by his own self-accusations of worthlessness, the \npatient feels an immense burden of guilt. We have to understand \nthis self-accusation not only as a reflection of guilt over unlived life \nbut also as a language for making sense out of one’s situation. In \nshort, even if one is a very guilty hero he is at least a hero in the \nsame hero-system. The depressed person uses guilt to hold onto his \nobjects and to keep his situation unchanged. Otherwise he would \nhave to analyze it or be able to move out of it and transcend it. \nBetter guilt than the terrible burden of freedom and responsibility,; \nespecially when the choice comes too late in life for one to be able 5  \nto start over again. Better guilt and self-punishment when you I \ncannot punish the other—when you cannot even dare to accuse hiai. \nas he represents the immortality ideology with \nj^entifi^d. If your god is discredited, you yourself die; the evil must \nbe in yourself and not in your god, so that you may live. With\n\f\n214 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nguilt you lose some of your life but avoid the greater evil of death.7 \nThe depressed person exaggerates his guilt because it unblocks \nhis dilemma in the safest and easiest way.8  He also, as Adler pointed \nout, gets the people around him to respond to himrTonpit^Em, and \nto value him and take care of him r He controls them and heightens \nHis own personality by his very self-pity and self-hatred? All these \n'things, then, make obsessive guilt prominent in the depression \nsyndrome. ' \"  ..........\"........*\nWe can thus see some of the complexities of the dynamics of \ndepression that have made it hard for us to understand it in an \nagreed and straightforward way, even though it is rather simple \nwhen conceptualized as the natural bogging-down of an unheroic \nhuman life. One of the things that hinders us, too, was Freuds \nlanguage and world-view. The Freudians said the menopausal de­\npression, for example, was triggered by a re-experiencing of the \nearly castration anxiety. It was easy to scoff at this explanation; it \nseemed that the Freudians were intent on once again reducing the \nproblems of an adult life to the Oedipal period and to their own \npatriarchal world-view. Here she was again, the poor castrated \nwoman paying the debt of her natural disadvantages. I myself \nreacted to this a decade ago with the temerity that comes with in­\nexperience and brashness and offered a theory to counter it, a \ntheory that went to the very opposite extreme and focussed on the \nfailure of social role and that alone. I saw that often menopausal \nwomen in psychiatric hospitals were there because their lives were \nno longer useful. In some cases their role as wives had failed be­\ncause of a late divorce; in others this circumstance combined with \nthe expiration of their role as mothers because their children had \ngrown up and married, and they were now alone with nothing \nmeaningful to do. As they had never learned any social role, trade, \nor skill outside of their work in the family, when the family no \nlonger needed them they were literally useless. That their depres­\nsion coincided with the time of menopause I thought was an ex­\ncellent illustration that the failure of useful social role could alone \nb£ called upon to explain the illness.\nWe encounter the Freudian world-view and language at almost \nevery turn as a peculiar scientific problem: it contains a powerful \ntruth that is phrased in such a manner as to be untrue. And we\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness\nourselves often get hung up ridiculously trying to untangle the two; \nor, we throw the truth out with the untrue accent. I suppose one \nhas to be brash to do anything at all in the present state of prolifera­\ntion of specialists, but it is dangerous. An occasional scoffer cannot \nwish away a half-century of clinical observation and thought. A \nconstant danger in science is that each gain risks abandoning \nground that was once securely annexed. Nowhere is this more true \nthan in the present “role-theories” of mental illness that threaten to \nabandon the Freudian formulations based on bodily facts.\nThe fact is that the womans experience of a repetition of castra­\ntion at menopause is a real one—not in the narrow focus that Freud \nused, but rather in the broader sense of Rank, the existentialists, and \nBrown. As Boss so well said, “castration fear” is only an inroad or an \naperture whereby the anxiety inherent in all existence may break \ninto ones world.10 It will be easy for us to understand at this point \nthat menopause simply reawakens the horror of the body, the utter \nbankruptcy of the body as a viable causa-sui project—the exact \nexperience that brings on the early Oedipal castration anxiety. The \nwoman is reminded in the most forceful way that she is an animal \nthing; menopause is a sort of “animal birthday” that specifically \nmarks the physical career of degeneration. It is like nature imposing \na definite physical milestone on the person, putting up a wall and \nsaying “You are not going any further into life now, you are going \ntoward the end, to the absolute determinism of death.” As men \ndon’t have such animal birthdays, such specific markers of a phys­\nical kind, they don’t usually experience another stark discrediting \nof the body as a causa-sui project. Once has been enough, and they \nbury the problem with the symbolic powers of the cultural world­\nview. But the woman is less fortunate; she is put in the position of \nhaving all at once to catch up psychologically with the physical facts \nof life. To paraphrase Goethe’s aphorism, .cleaJtluiiQesnl^ \ning cm her door only to be ignore^ (as .men.ignore their, aging), \nbut kicks it in to show himself full in the face,*\n* We might interject here that from this point of view, one of the crucial \nprojects of a person’s life, of true maturity, is to resign oneself to the process \nof aging. It is important for the person gradually to assimilate his true age, to \nstop protesting his youth, pretending that there is no end to his life. Eliot \nJacques, in his truly superb little essay “Death and the Mid-Life Crisis,” in\n\f\nOnce again we see that psychoanalysis has to be broadened to \ntake in the fear of death rather than fears of punishment from the \nparents. It is not the parents who are the “castrators” but nature \nherself. Probably the guilt feelings of the patient also express the \nnew real self-evaluation ovei being merely a fecal animal, dirty and \ntruly worthless. But now we see too how the Freudian view and \nthe sociological view merge naturally into one. Normally the cul­\ntural causa-sui project masks the re-experience of castration anxiety; \nbut it is precisely the failure of the social role, the cultural project, \nthat then reinforces the natural animal helplessness. Both projects, \nthe bodily one and the cultural one, join in a mutual, resounding \nfailure. No wonder, then, that menopausal depression is peculiarly \na phenomenon of those societies in which aging women are de­\nprived of some continuing useful place, some vehicle for heroism \nthat transcends the body and death. No wonder, too, that instead \nof the eternity of life that one has a right to take for granted under \nthe umbrella of a secure schema of self-perpetuation, the depressed \nperson feels instead condemned to an eternity of destruction.1* From \nthis vantage point, we have to admit that after all is said and done, \nthe accent on social role as the key to the syndrome is correct be­\ncause it is the superordinate level of the problems that absorbs the\nH. M. Ruitenbeek, ed., Death: Interpretations (New York: Delta Books,\n*969), Chapter 13, beautifully develops the idea of the need for “self- \nmourning,” the mourning of one’s own eventual death, and thus the working \nof it out of one’s unconscious where it blocks one’s emotional maturity. One \nmust, so to speak, work himself out of his own system. By a study of these \ndynamics we see how important it is for man to resign himself to his earthly \ncondition, his creatureliness; and we seem to have put full scientific closure \non James’s early insight on the place of inner emotional collapse in personal \ngrowth (James, Varieties, p. 99). We might say that in this sense Freud de­\nveloped the dynamics for the total resignation that he could not himself quite \nmanage. His ingenious discovery of the process called “mourning labor” can \nnow be understood as basic to the resignation of the person himself. (See \nPerls’s important appreciation in Ego, Hunger, and Aggression [New York: \nVintage Books], pp. 96-97, which reaffirms the total bodily character of this \nprocess.) We can also better understand how cultural forces conspire to pro­\nduce menopausal depression in any society that lies to the person about the \nstages of life, that has no provision in its world-view for the mourning of \none’s creatureliness, and that does not provide some kind of larger heroic \ndesign into which to resign oneself securely, as we will see.\n2l6 THE DENIAL OF DEATH"

    "raw_text": "bodily level. Heroism transmutes the fear of death into the security / \nof self-perpetuation, so much so that people can cheerfully face upf \nto death and even court it under some ideologies. v\nFurthermore, it is more realistic from a practical point of view to \nput the accent on the supportive social role because we cannot \nreally expect people at large to emerge from their lifelong object- \nembeddedness and to attain self-reliance and self-sustaining power \nwithout some continued vehicle for heroism. Existence is simply too \nmuch of a burden; object-embeddednessjnd bodily decay are uni­\nversally Jthe fate of men. -Withouf some kind of “ideology of justifica­\ntion^ people naturally bog down and fail. Here again'we caiT see \nhow correctly Rank emphasized the historical dimension of mental \nillness: the question is never about nature alone but also about the \nsocial ideologies for the transcendence of nature. If you cant be a \nhero within a communal ideology, then you must be a nagging, \nwhining failure in your family. From this perspective the problem \nof heroism and of mental illness would be “who nags whom?” Do \n1 men harangue the gods, the armies of other nations, the leaders of \ntheir own state, or their spouses? The debt to life has to be paid \nsomehow; one has to be a hero in the best and only way that he \ncan; in our impoverished culture even—as Harrington so truly put \nit—“if only for his skill at the pinball machine.”12\nSchizophrenia\nFrom the historical perspective the schizophrenic psychosis be­\ncomes more richly understandable. There is a type of person for \nwhom life is a more insurmountable problem than for others, for \nwhom the burden of anxiety and fear is almost as constant as his \ndaily breath. Rank used the term “neurotic” for one type of person \nwho was without illusion, who saw things as they were, who was \noverwhelmed by the fragility of the human enterprise; and in this \nsense the term describes perfectly the schizophrenic type. He is \nthe “realist” that William James talked about when he said that the \nright reaction to the horrors of organismic life on this planet is the \npsychotic one.13 But this kind of “realism,” as Rank said, is the most \nself-defeating of all.\nA General View of Mental Illness 217\n7\n\f\n218 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nAdler very early showed how the schizophrenic was crippled by \nthe fear of life and its demands, by a low self-evaluation in the \nface of them. He mistrusts not only himself but also the knowledge \nand ability of others; nothing seems to him to be able to overcome \nthe inevitable horrors of life and death—except perhaps the fan­\ntastic ideational system that he fabricates for his own salvation.14 \nHis feelings of magical omnipotence and immortality are a reaction \nto the terror of death by a person who is totally incapable of oppos­\ning this terror with his own secure powers. We might even say that \nthe psychotic uses blatantly, openly, and in an exaggerated way \nthe same kinds of thought-defenses that most people use wishfully, \nhiddenly, and in a more controlled way, just as the melancholic \nuses blatantly the defenses of the milder, more “normal” depressions \nof the rest of us: an occasional giving in to despair, a secret hatred \nof our loved ones, a quiet self-accusation and sorrowful guilt. In \nthis sense the psychoses are a caricature of the life styles of all of \nus—which is probably part of the reason that they make us so un­\ncomfortable.\nAdlers line of thought was developed by many people. Some of \nthem are among the most profound and subtle students of the \nhuman condition who have ever lived: H. S. Sullivan, H. F. Searles, \nand R. D. Laing—to mention the nearest few. The result is that we \nhave today an excellent general theory of schizophrenia in the \nscientific record for anyone to read. Here I want only to mention \nthe main characteristic of the syndrome—why it is that the schizo­\nphrenic is in such an extraordinary state of terror. It took a long \ntime for us to understand this state because we were dealing with \na phenomenon so strange it seems truly like science fiction. I mean \nthe fact that human experience is split into two modes—the sym­\nbolic self and the physical body—and that these two modes of ex­\nperience can be quite distinct. In some people they are so distinct \nas to be unintegrated, and these are the people we call schizo­\nphrenic. The hypersensitive individual reacts to his body as some­\nthing strange to himself, something utterly untrustworthy, something \nnot under his secure control.15\nRight away we can see that the schizophrenic is burdened, like \nall of us, with an “alien” animal body. What makes his burden \ngreater is that he is not securely rooted in his body. In his early \nchildhood development he did not develop a secure “seating” in his\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 219\nbody: as a result his self is not anchored intimately in his neuro­\nanatomy. He cannot make available to himself the natural or­\nganismic expansion that others use to buffer and absorb the fear of \nlife and death. He does not feel this natural animal plenitude. We \nmight say with Santayana that the healthy “Animal Faith” is denied \nhim, which is why he has to develop complex ideational systems \nof thought. We know today that the cultural sense of space, time, \nand perception of objects are literally built into the neural struc­\nture.16 As the cultural immortality ideology comes to be grounded \nin one's muscles and nerves, one lives it naturally, as a secure and \nconfident part of ones daily action. We can say that the schizo­\nphrenic is deprived precisely of this neurological-cultural security \nagainst death and of programming into life. He relies instead on a \nhypermagnification of mental processes to try to secure his death- \ntranscendence; he has to try to be a hero almost entirely idea- \ntionally, from within a bad body-seating, and in a very personal \nway. Hence the contrived nature of his efforts. No one understood \nbetter than Chesterton how freakish men become when they must \nrely on thoughts alone, separate from generous emotions in an ex­\npansive and secure body.17\nSchizophrenia takes the risk of evolution to its furthest point in \nman: the risk of creating an animal who perceives himself, reflects \non himself, and comes to understand that his animal body is a \nmenace to himself. When you are not even securely anchored in \nthis body it really becomes a problem. Terror becomes unabsorb- \nable by anything neural, anything fleshy in the spot where you \nstand; your symbolic awareness floats at maximum intensity all by \nitself. This is really a cursed animal in evolution, an animal gone \nastray beyond natural limits. We cannot imagine an animal com­\npletely open to experience and to his own anxieties, an animal \nutterly without programmed neurophysical reactivity to segments of \nthe world. Man alone achieves this terrifying condition which we \nsee in all its purity at the extremes of schizophrenic psychosis. In \nthis state each object in the environment presents a massive prob­\nlem because one has no response within his body that he can \nmarshal to dependably respond to that object. At least we could \nwish that an animal without instincts would be able to sink back \nat will into a friendly mass of flesh that he can call his own intimate \nand basic possession, even if it doesn’t “tell” him what response to\n\f\n220 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nmake. The schizophrenic cannot even do that. His body has com­\npletely “happened” to him, it is a mass of stench and decay. The \nonly thing intimate about it is that it is a direct channel of vulner­\nability, the direct toehold that the outer world has on his most inner \nself. The body is his betrayal, his continually open wound, the \nobject of his repulsion—as Catherine Deneuve portrayed so well in \nPolanskis “Repulsion.” No wonder this “disease” is the one that \nmost intrigues and fascinates man. It pushes his own protest over \nhis dualistic condition to its limits. It represents neurotic openness \ncarried to its extreme of helplessness. Freud very aptly called the \nsyndrome “narcissistic neurosis”: the ballooning of the self in \nfantasy, the complete megalomanic self-inflation as a last defense, as \nan attempt at utter symbolic power in the absence of lived physical \npower. Again, this is what cultural man everywhere strove to \nachieve, but the “normal” person is neurally programmed so that he \nfeels at least that his body is his to use with confidence.\nBy pushing the problem of man to its limits, schizophrenia also \nreveals the nature of creativity. If you are physically unprogrammed \nin the cultural causa-sui project, then you have to invent your own: \nyou don’t vibrate to anyone else’s tune. You see that the fabrications \nof those around you are a lie, a denial of truth—a truth that usually \ntakes the form of showing the terror of the human condition more \nfully than most men experience it. The creative person becomes, \nthen, in art, literature, and religion the mediator of natural terror \nand the indicator of a new way to triumph over it. He reveals the \ndarkness and the dread of the human condition and fabricates a \nnew symbolic transcendence over it. This has been the function of \nthe creative deviant from the shamans through Shakespeare.\nBut if the neurotic is the “artiste manque,” what is the schizo­\nphrenic who has no talent, who is not creative? He must be a com­\npletely inverted and pathetic failure, as the wards in our mental \nhospitals attest. An impoverished and powerless person—even when \nhe is a perceiver of truth—has no gift to offer to his fellows or to \nhimself. The uncreative psychotic is simply totally crippled by life- \nand-death fears. This is not the place to toss off in a few words such \na complex matter, so little understood, especially as I have not \nstudied the problem in depth or detail. The plain fact, however, is \nthat the matter revolves around one simple question: whether \none has an ego with which to control his subjective experiences, no"

If he does, then he gives form to his \nUnique perceptions; he takes the energetic life process as it func­\ntions on the frontier of evolution—in the dualistic mode of human \nlife—and he channels and contains it as a response to that mode. It \nbecomes the work of genius. We seem to be able to pointedly sum \nup the problem like this: The schizophrenic is not programmed \nneurally into automatic response to social meanings, but he cannot \nmarshal an ego response, a directive control of his experiences. His \nown erupting meanings cannot be given any creative form. We \nmight say that because of his exaggerated helplessness he uses his \nsymbolic inner experiences alone as an experiential anchor, as some­\nthing to lean on. He exists reflexively toward them, comes to be \ncontrolled by them instead of reshaping and using them. The genius \ntoo is not programmed in automatic cultural meanings; but he has \nthe resources of a strong ego, or at least a sufficient one, to give his \nown personal meanings a creative form. No one to my knowledge \nhas understood this difference between the genius and the schizo­\nphrenic better than Reich,18 at least in these gross terms.\nIn schizophrenia, like depression, we see the problem of heroics \nin its stark nudity. How does one become a hero from a position in \nwhich he has hardly any resources at all?—a position from which \nhe sees more clearly than anyone else the menacing dangers of life \nand death and yet has no solid feeling of inner glory to oppose to \nthem? He has to fabricate such a feeling in the best way he can, \nwhich will be a clumsy, crippled, and inverted way. No wonder \nthat psychotic transferences are so total, so intense, so all-absorbing, \nso frightening (when they are not pathetic). The only way for a \nlonely cripple to attempt a heroic transcendence of death is through \nthe complete servitude of personal idolatry, the total constriction of \n. the self in the person of the other. One has so little personal “ballast” \n—to use Adler s excellent expression19—that he has to suck in an \n; entire other human being to keep from disappearing or flying away.\nIf\nPerversion\nIt would be foolhardy to write about the perversions today if \none wanted to say something new; the literature is so immense— \nbig, thick volumes like Reiks on Masochism, sets of volumes like\n\f\n222 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nStekels on all the perversions, whole shelves on homosexuality; and \nin the professional journals, one article after another piling up in­\nsights and clinical facts. The problem is covered from all aspects \nand in a wealth of detail, a century's accumulation of scientific \nresearch. To my mind the best single book, summing up the key \narguments of various schools and adding its own brilliant contribu­\ntion, is Medard Boss's.20 After Erwin Strauss lifelong contributions, \nculminating in his recent essay on “The Miser,”21 we have the \nclearest and richest general theory that a science could hope for. \nBut again, the dafiger is that one can’t see the forest for the trees, \nthat it has become impossible to say anything about the perversions \nwithout saying everything. Some kind of simple-minded, general \nstatement is in order, one that is not itself polemical but tries to \ncombine all the major viewpoints into one clear perspective. For \nthe most part the Freudians, the existentialists, the Adlerians, and \nthe behaviorists continue to talk past each other. Let us then see if \nwe can pick out the crucial ingredients of the problem of perver­\nsion. It will give us an excellent review and summary of the prob­\nlem of human nature and the heroic, so that we can finally move on \nto the conclusion of our study.\nThe reason that it is worth dwelling on so seemingly an esoteric \nand marginal matter as the perversions is that they are not marginal \nat all. So much has been written on them precisely because they \nare the core problem of human action. They reveal what is at stake \nin that action better than any other behavior because they narrow \nit down to its essentials. In this sense the perversions are truly the \nsub-atomic theory of the human sciences, the nucleus where the \nbasic particles and energies are concentrated. This is why, too, they \nare usually reserved for the advanced and sophisticated student. But \nnow, after we have covered so much ground, our summary will \nreally be a review of everything we have discussed and so should be \nunderstandable with ease.\nWe saw earlier in several examples that Freuds genius opened \nup whole new territories to the understanding, and yet he phrased \nhis formulations in such narrow and single-minded terms that they \nobscured matters and caused a continued scientific debate long past \nthe need for such debate. Nowhere is this more true than on the \nproblem of the perversions. Freud made possible the conquest of\n\f\nA General View of Mental lUness 223\nthis most difficult terrain, and yet once again he caused us to shrug \nin disbelief. Take fetishism, which is surely the paradigm of per­\nversion and which Freud himself used as a kind of epitome of his \nwhole theoretical system. Why is it that the fetishist needs some \nobject like a shoe or a corset before he can begin to make love to \na woman? Freud answered:\nTo put it plainly: the fetish is a substitute for the woman’s (mother’s) \nphallus which the little boy once believed in and does not wish to forego \n—we know why.22\nNote the utter assurance of that last phrase. The “reason” is that the \nfemale genitals prove the reality of castration and awaken the \nhorror of it for oneself. The only way to triumph over this threat is \nto “give” the woman a phallus, however artificially and symbolically; \nand the fetish is precisely the “token of triumph over the threat of \ncastration and a safeguard against it. . . .” With it, the fetishist can \nproceed to have intercourse. The fetish “saves the fetishist from \nbeing a homosexual by endowing women with the attribute which \nmakes them acceptable as sexual objects.” In a word, the fetish gives \nhim the courage to be a man. Freud was so confident of his formu­\nlation that he said categorically:\nProbably no male human being is spared the terrifying shock of \nthreatened castration at the sight of the female genitals. . . . [And he \nconcluded triumphantly:] Investigations into fetishism are to be recom­\nmended to all who still doubt the existence of the castration com­\nplex. . . .23\nWhen a man of Freud’s stature makes such triumphant closure \non his whole work in a writing coming so late in his career, we \nhave to accept that it contains an indubitable truth. But again he \nhas engulfed us in the peculiar paradox of psychoanalysis—the \nphrasing of the most acute truth in a language of such concrete \nnarrowness as to make that truth unrecognizable. Let us, then, try \nto pull it apart. The way out of the paradox was shown to us by \nthinkers like Adler, Jung, Rank, Boss, Straus, and Brown. The hor­\nror of castration is not the horror of punishment for incestuous sex­\nuality, the threat of the Oedipus complex; it is rather the existential\n\f\n224 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nanxiety of life and death finding its focus on the animal body. This \nmuch is secure. But Freud stuck to the idea of the mother’s body, \nspecifically, the idea of the phallic mother that the child wants to \nbelieve in. All through the later psychoanalytic literature this idea \noccurs again and again in the fantasies of patients, and Robert Bak \nreaffirmed Freud’s basic idea in a most recent writing, in the same \ncategorical terms.\n. . .  in all perversions the dramatized or ritualized denial of castration is \nacted out through the regressive revival of the fantasy of the maternal or \nfemale phallus.24\nAnd here is a perfect description of the typical fantasy from May \nRomm’s rich paper:\nAt times the patient would fantasy during masturbation that he was able \nto take his penis in his mouth and in so doing he would be a complete \ncircle. At this period he dreamed that he was looking at his body and \ndiscovered that he had breasts like a woman and male genitals. . . . The \nGreek priest, in his cassock with his hair flowing over his shoulders, \nrepresented to him a neuter person, celibate and bisexual.25\nThe Hermaphroditic Image\nThe hermaphroditic image is an idea that goes right to the heart \nof the human condition and reveals to us the dynamic of the per­\nversions and what is at stake in the desperate efforts of crippled \npeople to find some kind of animal satisfaction in this world. The \nhermaphroditic symbol is no mystery after the writings of Rank, \nJung, and many others. The problem has been, again, to strip it of \nits narrow sexual connotations; it is not a sexual problem but a \nhuman problem. The self finds itself in a strange body casing and \ncannot understand this dualism. Man is aghast at the arbitrary \nnature of genitality, the accidentality of his separate sexual emer \ngence. He cant accept the impermanence of the body casing or its \nincompleteness—now male, now female. The body makes no sense\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 225\nto us in its physical thingness, which ties us to a particular kind of \nfate, a one-sided sexual role. The hermaphroditic image represents \na striving for wholeness, a striving that is not sexual but ontological. \nIt is the desire of being for a recapture of the (Agape) unity with \nthe rest of nature, as well as for a completeness in oneself. It is a \ndesire for a healing of the ruptures of existence, the dualism of self \nand body, self and other, self and world. Add the desire of the self \nfor self-perpetuation outside of and beyond the body, and we can \nunderstand how the partialness of the sexual identity is a further \nlimitation and danger.\nFreud was right to see the centrality of the image of the phallic \nmother and to connect it directly with the castration complex. But \nhe was wrong to make the sexual side of the problem the central \ncore of it, to take what is derivative (the sexual) and make it \nprimary (the existential dilemma). The wish for the phallic mother, \nthe horror of the female genitals, may well be a universal experience \nof mankind, for girls as well as boys. But the reason is that the child \nwants to see the omnipotent mother, the miraculous source of all \nI his protection, nourishment, and love, as a really godlike creature \ncomplete beyond the accident of a split into two sexes. The threat \nof the castrated mother is thus a threat to his whole existence in that \nhis mother is an animal thing and not a transcendent angel. The \nfate that he then fears, that turns him away from the mother in \nhorror, is that he too is a “fallen” bodily creature, the very thing \nthat he fights to overcome by his anal training. The horror of the \n; female genitals, then, is the shock of the tiny child who is all at \nonce—before the age of six—suddenly turned into a philosopher, a \n; tragedian who must be a man long before his time and who must \n> draw on reserves of wisdom and strength that he doesn't have. \nAgain, this is the burden of the “primal scene”: not that it awakens \nunbearable sexual desires in the child or aggressive hate and \nj jealousy toward the father, but rather that it thoroughly confuses \nhim about the nature of man. Romm observed on her patient:\nHis distrust of everyone he attributed mostly to the disappointment \nI consequent to his discovery of the sexual relationship between his parents. \nThe mother, who was supposed to be an angel, turned out to be human \nand carnal.28\n\f\n226 THE I>ENIA*l OF DEATH\nThis is perfect: how cat* you trust people who represent the priority \nof the cultural code of morality, the “angelic” transcendence of the \ndecay of the body, an<3 yet who cast it all aside in their most in­\ntimate relations? The p^ents are the gods who set the standards for \nones highest victory; a&dthe more unambiguously they themselves \nembody it, the more secure is the child's budding identity. When \nthey themselves engage in grunting and groaning animal activities, \nthe child finds it ‘‘disgusting”: the experience of disgust arises when \nstraightforward meanings are undermined. This is why—if he has \nnever witnessed the primal scene—the child often resists the revela­\ntion by his street friend that his parents' engage in sexual inter­\ncourse as everyone else • How apt was Tolstoy’s observation that so \nmuch separates him from the newborn babe, and so little from the \nchild of five; in those five years the child must shoulder the whole \nexistential burden of the human condition. There is really little more \nfor him to learn about his basic fate during the remainder of his \nlife.\nJung saw the wishful leaning and centrality of the hermaphro­\nditic image with great clarity and historical sweep,27 as did Rank all \nthrough his work, Boss,28 and Brown.29 Nothing is more eloquent \nand to the point than the words of a psychoanalytic patient, a fe­\nmale fetishist who “condemned the abhorrent envelope of her body” \nby saying: “I wish I could tear this skin off. If I didn’t have this \nstupid body, I would be as pure outside as I feel inside.”30\nThe body is definitely the hurdle for man, the decaying drag of \nthe species on the inner freedom and purity of his self. The basic \nproblem of life, in this sense, is whether the species (body) will \npredominate over one's individuality (inner self). This explains all \nhypochondria, the body being the major threat to one’s existence \nas a self-perpetuating creature. It explains too such dreams of \nchildren as that their hands are turning into claws. The emotional \nmessage is that they have no control over their fate, that the ac­\ncidentally of the body f°rm inhibits and restricts their freedom and \ndetermines them. One of the favorite games of childhood is “pin­\nning the tail on the donkey.” What better way to work off anxiety \nabout the accidentally °f the forms of things than to rearrange \nnature playfully with the same casualness with which she seems to \nhave placed bodily appendages? At heart children are Picassos pro­\n\f\nA General View of Mental IUness 227\ntesting the arbitrariness of external forms and affirming the priority \nof the inner spirit.31 Anxiety over the body shows up too in all \n“anal” dreams, when people find themselves soiled by overflowing \ntoilets, someone’s splashing urine—in the midst of the most im­\nportant affairs and all dressed up in their social finery. No mistake \n—the turd is mankind s real threat. We see this confusion between \nsymbolic transcendence and anal function throughout the psycho­\nanalytic literature. Romms patient, “Whenever he felt socially, \nfinancially or sexually insecure . . . developed flatulence and diar­\nrhea/' Or again: “He dreamed of seeing his father making a speech \nto an audience. Suddenly he notices that his father s penis was ex­\nposed.”32\nWhat, in other words, is the truth about the human condition? Is \nit in bodies or in symbols? If it is not straightforward, then there \nmust be some lie somewhere, which is the threat. Another patient \ncollected books, “and always wanted to defecate when he entered a \nbook-shop.”33 His own literaiy work was inhibited by his bodily \nfears. As we remarked several times, children really toilet train \nthemselves because of the existential anxiety of the body. It is often \npathetic how broken up they get when they accidentally wet their \npants, or how quickly and easily they give in to public morality and \nwill not urinate or defecate any more in the street “where someone \nmight see.” They do this quite on their own, even after being raised \nby the most unashamed parents. It is obvious that they are shamed \nby their own bodies. We can conclude quite categorically that \nhypochondrias and phobias are focalizations of the terror of lifS ind \nSeath bv an animal wKoaoesn’t want to be one. „\nIt was already plain in FreudTearly paper on the “Rat-man” that \ndeath and decay are central themes in the syndrome of obsession, \nand recently this was developed beautifully and with finality in the \nwork of the European existential psychiatrists, notably Straus.34 The \npsychoanalytic literature on fetishism, after Freud, shows very \nclearly what Rank had already argued: that the child is really \nbothered by bodies. Phyllis Greenacre provided the conclusive \nclinical closure on this in a series of very important papers that \nagreed that the castration anxiety long precedes the actual Oedipal \nperiod; it is a problem of global vulnerability rather than a \nspecifically sexual one. This is an important development out of\n\f\nFreud. In their favorite technical language the psychoanalysts say \nthat the castration anxiety is “specifically weighted .. . with a strong \nadmixture of oral and anal trends/’35 In other words, it is a problem \nof the whole bodily orientation to reality. In the history of fetishists \nwe see again and again that they are subjected to early traumas \nabout bodily decay and death.\nThe traumas which are most significant are those which consist of the \nwitnessing of some particularly mutilating event: a mutilating death or \naccident, operation, abortion, or birth in the home. ... If we take Freud’s \n1938 paper in which he outlines the development of a case of fetishism, \nand emphasizes the sight of the female genitals coincidental with mas­\nturbation and threats of castration just at the beginning of the phallic \nphase, and substitute for “threat of castration” “sight of mutilated and \nbleeding body,” I think we may envision what happens in a certain num­\nber of children.88\nThis would hold true naturally—and especially—if the child him­\nself had had a traumatic illness or painful operation.37 One of \nFenichel’s patients had a prolapsed rectum that his mother had to \npress back into place each time he moved his bowels. It is no sur­\nprise, then, that he was haunted by the fear that his intestine might \nfall into the lavatory-pan.38 Imagine being so vulnerable as to have \nto be pressed back into place. No wonder he was obsessed with a \nfear of death, that his castration anxiety was overwhelming, that he \nthought that his dead mother or his sister’s penis could have gone \ndown the drain just as turds and bathwater do or just as his intestine \nmight. The world is not particular about what it flushes away of \nbodies; things just mysteriously disappear. One of Lorand’s patients, \na boy of four, could not understand why a girl he had seen at camp \nhad no fingers on her hand or why one of his relatives was missing \na leg. He could not enter the same room with the man and ran away \nscreaming at the sound of his voice. He asked the doctor, quietly \nand with fear in his eyes: “You won’t make me disappear, will \nyou?”39 Here again we see the child as philosopher, voicing the \nconcern of Whitehead over one of the two great evils of organismic \nlife: that “things fade.”\nOne of the main conclusions that Greenacre arrived at about\n228 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 229\nfetishists was that their faulty early development was due to a num­\nber of similar things: excessive traumas, disturbed mother-child \nrelations, ruptured home life with absent fathers, or very weak \nfathers who present a poor model for the child's strength. These \nkinds of disturbance lead to one main disturbance: these people \nwere weak in their body confidence—to put it in nonclinical terms. \nSimon Nagler, in an important paper, traced the whole problem of \nfetishism to low self-esteem, the sense of inadequacy, and hence \nfear of the male role. These accents are important modifications on \nFreud because they stress the role of development rather than in­\nstinct. Freud lacked the rich developmental theory that has ac­\ncumulated since his time, which is why it had to be a mystery to \nhim why some people become homosexuals and others fetishists and \nyet the great majority of men become neither, but transcend the \nhorror of the female genitals.40 If the matter was one of instinct rel­\natively unaffected by developmental experience, then truly these \nthings would be a mystery. This focus on uniform instinct rather \nthan differential development was one of the main shortcomings of \nFreud's early work. Simon Nagler, in fact, goes so far as to want to \nthrow out the fear of castration entirely; he also questions the idea \nof the phallic mother.411 once agreed with him in some of my own \nimmodest and incomplete attempts to understand fetishism;42 but \nnow it is clear that this overemphasis is foolish. A rounded theory \nof fetishism has to recognize the centrality of the invulnerable \nphallic mother, the hermaphroditic image; it has to accept the \ngeneralized castration fear as the basic sense of vulnerability of the \nbody; and it has to include the developmental history that makes \nsome people weaker and more anxious than others in the face of \nexperience.\nThe idea of low self-esteem is of course crucial, but we have to \nremember that self-esteem is not at first a symbolic problem but an \nactive, organismic one. It takes root in the elemental physical ex­\nperience of the infant, when his experience gives him a confident \nnarcissism, a sense of invulnerability. High self-esteem means such \na sense of invulnerability, and one gets it in three basic ways. It \nderives first from the power of the other—from the mother when \nshe is a dependable support and does not interfere too much with \nthe child's own activity and from a strong father with whom the"

    "raw_text": "230 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nchild can identify. The second source of power to overcome vulner­\nability is one we have mentioned, the secure possession of one’s own \nbody as a safe locus under ones control. We see that this security \ncan be weakened by traumas, as well as by the quality of the early \nfamily environment. A third way one obtains power is of course \nfrom the cultural causa-sui project, the symbols and dramatizations \nof our transcendence of animal vulnerability. (We will see shortly \nhow important this third source is in fetishism.) Only these three \nthings taken together can give us a coherent view of the dynamics \nof fetishism.\nThe Problem of Personal Freedom \nversus Species Determinism\nMost people, then, avoid extreme fetishism because somehow \nthey get the power to use their bodies “as nature intended.” They \nfulfill the species role of intercourse with their partner without \nbeing massively threatened by it. But when the body does present a \nmassive threat to one’s self, then, logically, the species role becomes \na frightening chore, a possibly annihilating experience. If the body \nis so vulnerable, then one fears dying by participating fully in its \nacts. I think this idea sums up simply what the fetishist experiences. \nFrom this vantage point we could look at all perversion as a protest \nagainst the submergence of fodiyjffialifyby species standardization.\nRank developed this idea all through his work. The only way in \nwhich mankind could actually control nature and rise above her was \nto convert sexual immortality into individual immortality. Rank \nsums up the implications of this in a very powerful and suggestive \nway:\n. . .  in essence sexuality is a collective phenomenon which the individual \nat all stages of civilization wants to individualize, that is, control. This \nexplains all [!] sexual conflicts in the individual, from masturbation to \nthe most varied perversions and perversities, above all the keeping secret \nof eveiything sexual by individuals as an expression of a personal tend­\nency to individualize as much as possible collective elements in it.43\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness231\nIn other words, perversion is a protest against species sameness, \nagainst submergence of the individuality into the body. It is even \na focus of personal freedom vis-a-vis the family, one’s own secret \nway of affirming himself against all standardization. Rank even \nmakes the breathtaking speculation that the Oedipus complex in the \nclassic Freudian understanding may be an attempt by the child to \nresist the family organization, the dutiful role of son or daughter, \nthe absorption into the collective, by affirming his own ego.44 Even \nin its biological expression, then, the Oedipus complex might be an \nattempt to transcend the role of obedient child, to find freedom and \nindividuality through sex through a break-up of the family organiza­\ntion. In order to understand it we must once again emphasize the \nbasic motive of man, without which nothing vital can be understood \n—self-perpetuation. Man is divided into two distinct kinds of ex­\nperience—physical and mental, or bodily and symbolic. The prob­\nlem of self-perpetuation thus presents itself in two distinct forms. \nOne, the body, is standardized and given; the other, the self, is \npersonalized and achieved. How is man going to succeed himself, \nhow is he going to leave behind a replica of himself or a part of \nhimself to live on? Is he going to leave behind a replica of his body \nor of his spirit? If he procreates bodily he satisfies the problem of \nsuccession, but in a more or less standardized species form. Al­\nthough he perpetuates himself in his offspring, who may resemble \nhim and may carry some of his “blood” and the mystical quality of \nhis family ancestors, he may not feel that he is truly perpetuating \nhis own inner self, his distinctive personality, his spirit, as it were. \nHe wants to achieve something more than a mere animal succession. \nThe distinctive human problem from time immemorial has been the \nneed to spiritualize human life, to lift it onto a special immortal \nplane, beyond the cycles of life and death that characterize all other \norganisms. This is one of the reasons that sexuality has from the \nbeginning been under taboos; it had to be lifted from the plane of \nphysical fertilization to a spiritual one.\nBy approaching the problem of succession or self-perpetuation in \nits fully dualistic nature, Rank was able to understand the deeper \nmeanings of Greek homosexuality:\n\f\nSeen in this light, boy-love, which, as Plato tells us, aimed perpetually at \nthe improvement and perfection of the beloved youth, appears definitely \nas ... a spiritual perfecting in the other person, who becomes transferred \ninto the worthy successor of oneself here on earth; and that, not on the \nbasis of the biological procreation of one’s body, but in the sense of the \nspiritual immortality-symbolism in the pupil, the younger.45\nt In other words, the Greek sought to impress his inner self, his spirit \nor soul, upon the beloved youth. This spiritual friendship was de­\nl i  signed to produce a son in whom ones soul would survive:\nIn boy-love, man fertilized both spiritually and otherwise the living \nimage of his own soul, which seemed materialized in an ego as idealized \nand as much like his own body as was possible.46\nThis brilliant speculation enables us to understand some of the \nideal motives for homosexuality, not only of the Greeks, but of \nespecially individualized and creative persons like Michelangelo. \nFor such a one, apparently, homosexuality has nothing to do with \nthe sex organs of the beloved but rather represents a struggle to \ncreate one’s own rebirth in the “closest possible likeness,” which, as \nRank says, is obviously to be found in one’s own sex.47 In terms of \nour discussion we can see that this attempt represents the complete \ncausa-sui project: to create all by oneself a spiritual, intellectual, and \nphysically similar replica of oneself: the perfectly individualized \nself-perpetuation or immortality symbol.\nIf the castration complex represents the admission by the child \nthat his animal body is a bankrupt causa-sui project, what better \nway to defy the body than by abandoning its sexual role entirely? \nIn this sense perversions would equal a total freedom from the \ncastration complex; they are a hyperprotest against species sameness. \nBut Rank was so intent on accenting the positive, the ideal side of \nperversion that he almost obscured the overall picture. We are no \nlonger ancient Greeks, and very few of us are Michelangelos; in a \nword, we are not dominated by ideal motives nor do we possess the \nhighest powers of genius. Routine perversions are protests out of \nweakness rather than strength; they represent the bankruptcy of \ntalent rather than the quintessence of it. If the neurotic is the \n“artiste manque,” all the more is the usual homosexual the “Greek\n232 ' THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 233\nmanque,” the Michelangelo without secure power and talent. The \npervert is the clumsy artist trying desperately for a counter-illusion \nthat preserves his individuality—but from within a limited talent \nand powers: hence the fear of the sexual role, of being gobbled up \nby the woman, carried away by one's own body, and so on. As F. \nH. Allen—an earlier follower of- Rank—pointed out, the homosexual \nis often one who chooses a body like his own because of his terror of \nthe difference of the woman, his lack of strength to support such a \ndifference.48 In fact, we might say that the pervert represents a \nStriving for individuality precisely because he does not feel in­\ndividual at all and has little power to sustain an identity. Perver­\nsions represent an impoverished and ludicrous claim for a sharply \ndefined personality by those least equipped by their early develop­\nmental training to exercise such a claim. If, as Rank says, perver­\nsions are a striving for freedom, we must add that they usually \nfepresent such a striving by those least equipped to be able to stand \njfreedQjflu They flee the species slavery not out of strength but ouTof \n;^^n^s^3ja,iaability to suppdrTTKB'^prdjrammar sideToTthefr \nnafure. As we saw above, the chil8hood experience d  \ndeveloping a secure sense of one s body, firm identification with the \nfather, strong ego control over oneself, and dependable interpersonal \nskills. Only if one achieves these can he \"do the species role” in a \nself-forgetful way, a way that does not threaten to submerge him \nwith annihilation anxiety.\nWhen we sum up this whole problem we can see that there are \nseveral ways to overcome the sense of sex as a species-standardiza- \ntion threat to oneself, most of which lie on a spectrum of despera­\ntion and ingenuity, rather than self-confidence and control. The \nmost ideal way, the “highest” way, is of course in the experience of \nlove. Here, one identifies with the partner totally and banishes the \nthreat of separateness, helplessness, anxious self-consciousness vis- \nd-vis the body. The lover gives himself in joy and self-forgetful \n'fulfillment, the body becomes the treasured vehicle for ones \napotheosis, and one experiences real gratitude precisely to the \nspecies sameness. One is glad to have a standardized body because \nit permits the love union. But even without ideal love, one can give \nin to strong physical desire and allow himself to be ‘carried away” \nin a self-forgetful manner, so that the species is no threat to ones\n\f\ndistinctive inner self. We see this in phallic narcissism and in some \nforms of what is called “nymphomania.” Here the person seems to \ngive in to the species identity with a vengeance, to submerge him­\nself in it totally. Perhaps this activity gives the person a relief from \nthe burdens of his self and his dualism. It may often be what the \npsychoanalysts call a ‘counter-phobic” attitude: to embrace whole­\nheartedly just what one dreads, as a means of protesting that it \nholds no anxiety. In many forms of sado-masochism it must also \nrepresent the plunging into the “truth” of the body, the affirmation \nof the physical as the primary area of reality, as Fromm has so well \nspeculated. Finally, in schizoid persons, the anxiety connected with \nthe species body is so great that they can simply dissociate them­\nselves from their bodies, even during the act of sexual intercourse. \nIn this way they preserve the sanctity of their own inner selves \nagainst the degradations of the body. Prostitutes, too, are said to \nactively practice this kind of self-body dissociation to keep their \npersonal identities intact and pure no matter how degraded they \nmay feel physically. As one schizophrenic girl remarked, in the most \noffhand manner, “I think I was raped on the way here.” This is an \naffirmation, with a vengeance, of the transcendence of the inner \nspirit, a complete freedom from contamination by the body. Once \nagain we see that schizophrenia represents the extreme frontier of \nthe human condition, a desperate solution of the problem of \ndualism that evolution has saddled us with. This kind of despera­\ntion partakes necessarily of caricature: man cannot get rid of his \nbody even if he throws it away—to paraphrase Goethe. There can \nbe no absolute transcendence of the species role while men live. \nWhen even the greatest talents of a Michelangelo leave us filled \nwith some doubts about human victory, what are we to say of the \npathetic efforts of lesser beings who must still drag their bodies \nthrough the span of life and use them to relate to others?\n234 THE denial of death\nThe Fetish Object and the Dramatization\nOnce we understand the problems of hermaphroditic wholeness, \nself and body, strength and weakness, species determinism and \npersonal freedom, we can begin to get some idea of what the\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 235\nfetishists are trying to do. This is surely the most fascinating area \nof this problem, as we can see by exploring it even a little.\nOne of the main puzzles has been what the fetish object repre­\nsented, what the meaning was of a shoe or a corset, leather and \nfurs, or even an artificial leg.49 Freud and his followers maintained \nsteadfastly that it represented “a quite special penis”—the \nmothers.50 It was also argued that the fetish represented a denial of \nthe penis, a vagina, feces, and the like. All of which seems to in­\ndicate that what it represented was not clear, that it could represent \nmany things to many different fetishists, which is surely the truth \nof the matter. But another thing is sure, which is that the fetish had \nto do with a problem posed by the sexual act. Boss showed this in a \nmost brilliant manner.51 Out of his study, as well as from the ex­\ncellent succession of papers by Greenacre, has come a new and \nfuller understanding of the fetish object. If fetishism represents the \nanxiety of the sexual act, the danger of species functioning for a \nsymbolic animal, what must the fetish be if not some sort of magical \ncharm? The fetish object represents the magical means for trans­\nforming animality into something transcendent and thereby assur­\ning a liberation of the personality from the standardized, bland, and \nearthbound flesh. Such a liberation gives one the courage to perform \nthe sexual act, as he is not bound to it in an animal way but already \ntranscends it symbolically. Freud was right when he said that the \nfetish saved the person from homosexuality, but not because it was \na penis—except perhaps, as Boss says,52 for the weakest men. Rather, \nthe fetish is a way of transforming reality. Boss says of one of his \npatients:\nWhenever he saw or touched [ladies boots] “the world changed \nmiraculously,” he said. What had just appeared as “grey and senseless \nwithin the dreary, lonely and unsuccessful everyday, then suddenly drifts \naway from me, and light and glamour radiate from the leather to me.” \nThese leather objects seemed to have “a strange halo” shedding its light \nupon all other things. “It is ridiculous, but it feels like being a fairy \nprince. An incredible power, Mana, emanates from these gloves, furs and \nboots, and completely enchants me.” . . . Naked women or a woman’s \nhand without a glove or especially a womans foot without a shoe . . . \nseemed to be like lifeless pieces of meat in a butcher shop. In fact, a \nwomans naked foot was really repulsive to him. . . . However, when the \nwoman wore a glove, a piece of fur, or a riding boot, she was at once\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\n“raised above her arrogant, too humanly personal level.” She then grew \nabove the “pettiness and vicious concreteness of the common female” \nwith her “abhorrent genitals” and she was raised into the super individual \nsphere, “the sphere where superhuman and subhuman blend into uni­\nversal godliness.”53\nNot much more needs to be said after such an astonishingly prob­\ning revelation. The fetish takes “species meat” and weaves a magic \nspell around it. The impersonal, concrete, animal demand is ar­\nrogant, insulting: you are confronted by a body and obliged to \nrelate to that body wholly on its terms, terms entirely given by its \nflesh and sex. Boss’s patient says: “Somehow I always think that \nsexual intercourse is a great disgrace for humans.”54 The fetish \nchanges all this by transforming the whole quality of the relation­\nship. Everything is spiritualized, etherealized. The body is no longer \nflesh, no longer an impersonal demand by the species; it has a \nhalo, emanates light and freedom, becomes a really personal, in­\ndividual thing.55\nAs Greenacre so well argued, pills and pellets are forms of fetishes \ntoo, ways of overcoming anxiety, the terror of the body, in a reassur­\ning magical way.56 Fetishism exists on a gamut running from pills \nall the way to furs, leather, silks, and shoes. We then have full­\nblown articles for the exercise of a kind of symbolic magic: the \nperson hypnotizes himself with the fetish and creates his own aura \nof fascination that completely transforms the threatening reality.57 \nIn other words, men use the fabrications of culture, in whatever \nform, as charms with which to transcend natural reality. This is \nreally the extension of the whole problem of childhood: the aban­\ndonment of the body as causa-sui project, in favor of the new magic \nof cultural transcendence. No wonder fetishism is universal, as \nFreud himself remarked: all cultural contrivances are self-hypnotic \ndevices—from motorcars to moon rockets—ways that a sorely \nlimited animal can drum up to fascinate himself with the powers of \ntranscendence over natural reality. As no one can be exactly com­\nfortable in the species submergence of his distinctive inner self, all \nof us use a bit of magical charming in our relations to the world.\nIf the fetish object is a magical charm, then it naturally partakes \nof the qualities of magic, that is, it must have some of the properties\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 237\nj of the thing that it seeks to control. To control the body, then, it \nmust show some intimate relationship to the body—have an impress \nof its form, possess some of its smell, testify to its concreteness and \nanimality. This is why, I think, the shoe is the most common fetish. \nIt is the closest thing to the body and yet is not the body, and it is \nassociated with what almost always strikes fetishists as the most \nugly thing: the despised foot with its calloused toes and yellowed \ntoenails. The foot is the absolute and unmitigated testimonial to our \ndegraded animality, to the incongruity between our proud, rich, \nlively, infinitely transcendent, free inner spirit and our earth-bound \nbody. Someone I know summed it up perfectly: \"The foot is such a \ndumb-looking thing.” Freud thought that the shoe was fetishized \nbecause, as it was the last thing the child saw before looking up at \nthe dreaded genitals, he could safely stop there for his denial.58. \nBut the foot is its own horror; what is more, it is accompanied by \nits own striking and transcending denial and contrast—the shoe. \nThe genitals and breasts, it is true, are contrasted by underclothing \nand stiff corsets, which are popular as fetishes, but nothing equals \nthe foot for ugliness or the shoe for contrast and cultural con­\ntrivance. The shoe has straps, buckles, the softest leather, the most \nelegant curved arch, the hardest, smoothest, shiniest heel.59 There \nis nothing like the spiked high heel in all of nature, I venture. In a \nword, here is the quintessence of cultural contrivance and contrast, \nso different from the body that it takes one a safe world away from \nit even while remaining intimately associated to it.\nAlso, if the fetish is a charm it has to be a very personal and \nsecret charm, as Greenacre argues. We have long known, from \nsociology and the writings of Simmel, how important the secret is \nfor man. The secret ritual, the secret club, the secret formula—these \ncreate a new reality for man, a way of transcending and transform­\ning the everyday world of nature, giving it dimensions it would not \notherwise possess and controlling it in arcane ways. The secret \nimplies, above all, power to control the given by the hidden and \nthus power to transcend the given—nature, fate, animal destiny. Or, \nas Greenacre put it, \"...  the secret relates at its most primitive \nlevel to body organs and processes ... it contains more fundamen­\ntally the struggle with the fear of death... ”60\nThe secret, in other words, is man’s illusion par excellence, the\n1\n\f\ndenial of the bodily reality of his destiny. No wonder man has al­\nways been in search of fountains of youth, holy grails, buried \ntreasures—some kind of omnipotent power that would instantly \nreverse his fate and change the natural order of things. Greenacre \nrecalls, too, with brilliant appositeness, that Hermann Goering hid \ncapsules of poison in his anus, using them to take his own life in \na final gesture of defiant power.61 This is the reversal of things with \na vengeance: using the locus of animal fallibility as the source of \ntranscendence, the container for the secret amulet that will cheat \ndestiny. And yet this, after all, is the quintessential meaning of \nanality: it is the protest of all of mans cultural contrivances as anal \nmagic to prove that of all animals he alone leads a charmed life be­\ncause of the splendor of what he can imagine and fashion, what he \ncan symbolically spin out of his anus.\nThe final characteristic of mysterious rituals is that they be \ndramatized; and the activities of fetishists and allied perverts such \nas transvestites have always fascinated observers precisely because \nof that. They stage a complicated drama in which their gratification \ndepends on a minutely correct staging of the scene; any small de­\ntail or failure to conform to the precise formula spoils the whole \nthing. The right words have to be pronounced at the right time, the \nshoes arranged in a certain way, the corset put on and laced cor­\nrectly, and so on.62 The fetishist prepares for intercourse in just the \nright way to make it safe. The castration anxiety can be overcome \nonly if the proper forms of things prevail. This pattern sums up the \nwhole idea of ritual—and again, of all of culture: the manmade \nforms of things prevailing over the natural order and taming it, \ntransforming it, and making it safe.\nIt is in transvestism that we see an especially rich staging of the \ndrama of transcendence. Nowhere do we see the dualism of culture \nand nature so strikingly. Transvestites believe that they can trans­\nform animal reality by dressing it in cultural clothing—exactly as \nmen everywhere do who dress pompously to deny, as Montaigne \nput it, that they sit “on their arse” just like any animal, no matter \nA how grandiose the throne. The clinical transvestite, however, is even \nVnore dedicated than the average man, more simple-minded it seems, \ncompletely obsessed by the power of clothing to create an identity. \nOften there is a past history of dressing dolls or of playing games \nwith one's sister in which clothing was exchanged and with it the\n238 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 239\nidentity of each one.63 It is obvious that for these people “the play \nis the thing,” and they are as dedicated as stage personalities to \nactually being what their clothes make them.\nWhat do they want to be? It seems that they want to refute the \ncastration complex, overcome the species identity, the separation \ninto sexes, the accidentally of the single sex and its confining fate, \nthe incompleteness within each of us, the fact that we are a frag­\nment not only of nature but even of a complete body. The trans­\nvestite seems to want to prove the reality of hermaphroditism by \npossessing a penis and yet appearing as a woman.64 “I want to be \nmy sister and yet to retain my penis,” said one patient:\nWhen indulging in his perverse practices, it was his custom, as soon as \nejaculation had taken place, to tear the borrowed clothes off as quickly \nas possible. In connection with this he had the association that he had \nbeen warned that, if one made faces and the clock struck, one’s face \nwould stay so. Thus he was afraid that he might actually “remain stuck” \nin his feminine role, and this would involve his forfeiting his penis.65\nObviously, this is one way of affirming that the game is for keeps, \nthe play is the reality, and if one gets caught when the clock strikes \ntwelve he is apt to lose everything. Bak reports similarly on his \npatient:\nDressing up and undressing in front of a mirror dominated his practice \nfor a long time. The penis was bandaged and very forcefully tied back­\nward, and the testes pushed back into the inguinal canal. Such episodes \nwere followed by intense castration anxiety—he feared that the shaft was \nbroken, that the penis had become crooked, that the spermal duct was \ntom and he would be sterile.66\nThe dramatic play-control of sex does not absorb the anxiety com­\npletely, probably again because the danger of it heightens the sense \nof the reality of the games and because of the inevitable sense of \nguilt from the fact that the self is now completely overshadowed by \nthe body in both its sexual forms, which can only mean that in­\ndividuation is completely stunted.\nThere is no doubt about the simple-minded dedication to the \nmagical efficacy of clothing. Fenichels patient, on one occasion \nwhen he caught sight of a crippled boy, “felt an impulse to change\n\f\n240 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nclothes with him. The implication was a denial that the boy really \nwas a cripple.”67 But often these fantasies can be turned to reality. \nOne of Greenacres patients had many fantasies of changing boys \ninto girls and vice versa and went on to become an endocrino­\nlogist!68 From which we can conclude that the transvestite and the \nfetishist do not live entirely in illusion. They have glimpsed the \ntruth that all men live, that culture can indeed transform natural \nreality. There is no hard and fast line between cultural and natural \ncreativity. Culture is a symbol system that actually does give power \nto overcome\" the castration complex. Ttfan can partly create him- \nselfrlirfSiSt^drfi' this point of view, we can understand transvestism \nas the perfect form of causa sui, the direct sexual relationship to \noneself, without having to go via the “circuitous” route of a female \npartner. As Buckner pointed out in a stimulating essay, the trans­\nvestite seems to develop a female personality within himself; this \ngives him an internal two-person relationship, actually an “internal \nmarriage.”69 He is not dependent on anyone for sexual gratification \nsince he can enact his own “counter-role.” This is the logical con­\nsequence of the hermaphroditic completeness, the becoming of a \nwhole world unto oneself.\nNowhere is there a better example of the blurring of the line be­\ntween fetishist creativity and cultural creativity than in the ancient \nChinese practice of binding the feet of females. This practice \nmutilated the feet, which were then an object of veneration by the \nmen even though deformed. Freud himself remarked on this practice \nin relation to fetishism and observed that the “Chinese man seems \nto want to thank the woman for having submitted to castration.”70 \nAgain, a profound insight conceptualized and phrased slightly be­\nside the point. We should rather say that this practise represents \nthe perfect triumph of cultural contrivance over the animal foot— \nexactly what the fetishist achieves with the shoe. The veneration, \nthen, is the same: gratitude for the transformation of natural reality. \nThe mutilated foot is a testimonial and token sacrifice to the efficacy \nof culture. The Chinese are then revering themselves, their culture, \nin the foot, which has now become sacred precisely because it has \nleft the given and bland reality of the everyday animal world.\nBut somewhere we have to draw the line between creativity and \nfailure, and nowhere is this line more clear than in fetishism. The \nanal protest of culture can be self-defeating, especially if we like"

Secret magic \nand private dramatization may be a hold on reality, the creation of \na personal world, but they also separate the practitioner from \nreality, just as cultural contrivances do on a more standardized level. \nGreenacre has understood this very acutely, remarking that the \nsecret is Janus-faced, a subterfuge that weakens the persons rela­\ntionships to others.71 The transvestite in his secret internal marriage \nactually does without the marriage relationship entirely. In all of \nthis we must not forget the general impoverishment of the fetishist \nand transvestite: the insecure identification with the father, the \nweak body-ego.72 Perversion has been called a “private religion”— 1 \nand that it really is, but it testifies to fear and trembling and not to \nfaith. It is an idiosyncratic, symbolic protest of control and safety \nby those who can rely on nothing—neither their own powers nor \nthe shared cultural map for interpersonal action. This is what makes \ntheir ingenuity pathetic. As the fetishist, unlike the matter-of-fact \ncultural performer, is not secure in his repressions and body-ego, he \nis still overwhelmed by the sexual act, the demand that he do some­\nthing responsible to someone else with his entire body. Romm says \nof her patient: “While he had a very sensitive need for his wife’s \nsexual compliance, all desire left him whenever his wife indicated \nany sexual drive.”73 We can look at this as the refusal of the im­\npersonal, instrumental species role, but it is a refusal based in in­\nsecurity, when one is called upon to perform. Remember we said, \nwith Rank, that a major characteristic of neurosis was seeing the \nworld as it is, in all its superordinacy, power, overwhelmingness. \nThe fetishist must feel the truth of his helplessness vis-d-vis the \nponderous object and the task he has to perform. He is not securely \nenough “programmed” neurally by solid repressions and body-ego, \nto be able to falsify his real situation and hence act his animal role \nwith indifference. The object must be overwhelming in its massive­\nness of hair, pendulous breasts, buttocks, and stomach. What at­\ntitude to take toward all this “thingness” when one feels so empty \nin himself? One of the reasons that the fetish object is itself so \nsplendid and fascinating to the fetishist must be that he transfers \nto it the awesomeness of the other human presence. The fetish is \nthen the manageable miracle, while the partner is not. The result \nis that the fetish becomes supercharged with a halo-like effect.\n\f\n242 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nRomm’s patient saw things in their pristineness and never got \nover the effect:\nThe patient s earliest recollection was of his mother washing her hair. When drying her hair in the sun she would throw it over her face. He was both fascinated and horrified at not being able to see her face, and relieved when it was again visible. Her hair combings held a great fascination for him.74\nOn one level we might understand this as expressing the anxiety \nof the child that the most personal and human part of the object \n—the face—can be eclipsed by the animal hair. But the whole \nfeeling of the scene is one of awesomeness at the miracle of the \ncreated object. Most of us manage to get over the hypnotic quality \nof natural objects, and we do it, I think, in two related ways. One is \nby achieving a sense of our own power and so establishing a kind \nof balance between ourselves and the world. We can then ply our \ndesires on the object without being thrown off balance by them. \nBut a second thing must also be done: desire itself has to be \nfetishized. We cannot relate to the total object as it is, and thus we \nneed standardized definitions of sexual attractiveness. These we get \nin the form of “cues” that serve to cut the object down to manage­\nable size: we look at the breast or the black underwear, which \nallow us not really to have to take account of the total person we are \nrelating to.75 In these two ways we strip the partner of awesome­\nness and power and so overcome our general helplessness in the \nface of her. One of Greenacre s patients conveys the problem per­\nfectly:\nIf he continued to see the girl she would become increasingly repulsive to him, especially as his attention seemed inevitably focussed on her body orifices. Even the pores of her skin began to be too conspicuous, to loom larger and become repellent. . . . Gradually he found too that he could be more successful if he approached a girl from the rear and did not have to be visually or tactually too aware of the difference between them.76\n(I think here, too, of Rousseaus famous account of his repulsion \nfrom the breath-taking Venetian whore, when he noticed a slight \nimperfection on her breast.) When the overwhelming object cannot \nbe shrunken as a straightforward vehicle of desire, it could become \nrepulsive because its animal qualities become disengaged from it\n\f\nA General View of Menial Illness 243\nand begin to loom larger and larger. This, I think, might explain \nthe paradox that the fetishist is overwhelmed by the awesomeness \nof the object, the superordinacy of it, and yet finds it repulsive in its \nanimality. The foot only becomes a problem in itself as a paradigm \nof ugliness when we cannot fuse it into the body under the secure \nrush of our own desire and will. Otherwise it is a neutral part of an \nattractive woman. The fetishists difficulty, then, is like the child’s \nexactly: the inability to master pragmatic action situations with the \nrequisite equanimity. I think this helps explain, too, why the typical \nphallic-narcissist, the Don Juan character, often takes any object— \nugly or beautiful—that comes along, with the same unconcern: he \ndoes not really take account of it in its total personal qualities.f\nAll perversions, then, can truly be seen as “private religions,” as\nf This brings up the longstanding problem of why so few females are \nfetishists, a problem that has been solved by Greenacre and Boss. Their point \nis that the male, in order to fulfill his species role, has to perform the sexual \nact. For this he needs secure self-powers and also cues to arouse and chan­\nnelize his desires. In this sense, the male is naturally and inevitably a fetishist \nof some kind and degree. The less self-power, the more terror of the looming \nfemale body, the more fetish narrowness and symbolism is necessary. The \nfemale does not have this problem because her role is passive; we might say \nthat her fetishism is absorbed in the surrender of her body. As Boss says, \nwomen who shrink at the physical aspect of love, at the concreteness of the \npartner, can simply react with total frigidity (Sexual Perversions, pp. 53-54). \nOr, as Greenacre observed as well: “The sense of failure due to frigidity in \nthe female is softened by the possibility of concealment” (“Further Considera­\ntions,” p. 188, note). “Frigidity can be covered up to a degree which is not \npossible with disturbances of potency in the man” (“Further Notes,” p. 192). \nAlso, the woman, in her passive, submissive role, often gets her security by \nidentifying with the power of the male; this overcomes the problem of vul­\nnerability by receiving delegated powers—both of the penis itself and of the \ncultural world-view. But the male fetishist is precisely the one who does not \nhave secure delegated powers from any source and cannot get them by passive \nsubmission to the female (Cf. Greenacre, “Certain Relationships,” p. 95). We \nmight sum this all up by saying that the frigid woman is one who submits but \nis not convinced that she is safe in the power of the male; she does not need \nto fetishize anything as she does not have to perform an act. The impotent \nmale is also not convinced that he is safe, but it does not suffice for him to lie \npassively in order to fulfill his species role. He creates the fetish, then, as a \nlocus of denial-power so that he can perform the act; the woman denies with \nher whole body. Using an artfully apt term of Von Gebsattel’s, we could say \nthat frigidity is the woman's form of “passive autofetishism” (Cf. Boss, Sexual \nPerversions, p. 53).\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\nattempts to heroically transcend the human condition and to achieve \nsome kind of satisfaction in that condition. That is why perverts arc \nforever saying how superior and life-enhancing their particular ap­\nproach is, how they cannot understand why anyone would not \nprefer it. It is the same sentiment that animates all true believers, \nthe trumpeting of who is the true hero and what is the only genuine \npath to eternal glory.\nAt this point perversions and so-called normality meet. There is \nno way to experience all of life; each person must close off large \nportions of it, must “partialize,” as Rank put it, in order to avoid \nbeing overwhelmed. There is no way to surely avoid and transcend \ndeath, for all organisms perish. The biggest, warmest, most secure, \ncourageous spirits can still only bite off pieces of the world; the \nsmallest, meanest, most frightened ones merely bite off the smallest \npossible pieces. I recall the episode of the illustrious Immanuel Kant \nwhen a glass was broken at one of his gatherings; how carefully he \nweighed the alternatives for a perfect place in the garden where \nthe fragments could safely be buried so that no one would be in­\njured by them accidentally. Even our greatest spirits must indulge \nin the fetishists magical, ritual drama to banish accident because \nof animal vulnerability.\nThe Naturalness of Sado-Masochism\nAlthough there is nothing new to say on this problem, with all \nthe vast writings that have covered it, I want to again stress the \nnaturalness of these perversions. Sadism and masochism seem like \nfrighteningly technical ideas, secrets about the inner recesses of man \nonly fully revealed to practicing psychoanalysts. Even more than \nthat, they seem like rare and grotesque aberrations of normal \nhuman conduct. Both these suppositions are false. Masochism comes \nnaturally to man, as we have seen again and again in these pages. \nMan is naturally humble, naturally grateful, naturally guilty, \nnaturally transcended, naturally a sufferer; he is small, pitiful, weak, \na passive taker who tucks himself naturally in a beyond of superior, \nawesome, all-embracing power. Sadism likewise is the natural \nactivity of the creature, the drive toward experience, mastery, \npleasure, the need to take from the world what it needs in order to \nincrease itself and thrive;77 what is more, a human creature who"

Sado-masochism, then, re­\nflects the general human condition, the daily lives of most people. \nIt reflects man living by the nature of the world and his own nature \nas it has been given to him. Actually, then, it reflects “normal” \nmental health.78\nDo we wonder, for example, that rape is on the increase in \ntodays confused world? People feel more and more powerless. How \ncan they express their energies, get things more in balance between \noverwhelming input and feeble output? Rape gives a feeling of \npersonal power in the ability to cause pain, to totally manipulate \nand dominate another creature. The autocratic ruler, as Canetti so \nwell observes, gets the ultimate in the experience of domination and \ncontrol by turning all persons into animals and treating them as \nchattels. The rapist gets the same kind of satisfaction in what seems \na perfectly natural way; there are very few situations in life in \nwhich people can get a sense of the perfect appropriateness of their \nenergies: the quickened vitality that comes when we prove that our \nanimal bodies have the requisite power to secure their dominion in \nthis world—or at least a living segment of it.|\nJ This explains, too, the naturalness of the connection between sadism and \nsexuality without putting them on an instinctive basis. They represent a \nmutually reinforcing sense of appropriate power, of heightened vitality. Why, \nfor example, does a boy masturbate with fantasies on such a gory story as the \n“Pit and the Pendulum” (Greenacre, “Certain Relationships,” p. 81)? We have \nto imagine that the fantasy gives him a sense of power that the masturbation \nreinforces; the experience is a denial of impotence and vulnerability. It is much \nmore than a simple sexual experience; it is much less than an expression of \ngratuitous destructive drives. Most people secretly respond to sado-masochistic \nfantasies not because everyone is instinctively perverse but because these \nfantasies do represent the perfect appropriateness of our energies as well as \nour limitations as animal organisms. No higher satisfaction is possible for us \nthan to dominate entirely a sector of the world or to give in to the powers of \nnature by surrendering ourselves completely. Very fittingly these fantasies \nusually take place when people are having trouble with the stress of symbolic \naffairs of the everyday world, and one may wonder why—at a meeting con­\ncerning business or academic strategy—he can’t shut out images from Luis \nBunuel’s “Belle de Jour.”\n\f\nHave we always been puzzled by how willingly the masochist \nexperiences pain? Well, for one thing pain calls the body to the \nforefront of experience. It puts the person back into the center of \nthings forcefully as a feeling animal. It is thus a natural complement \nto sadism. Both are techniques for experiencing forceful self-feel- \ning, now in outer-directed action, now in passive suffering. Both \ngive intensity in the place of vagueness and emptiness. Furthermore, \nto experience pain is to “use” it with the possibility of controlling it \nand triumphing over it. As Irving Bieber argued in his important \npaper, the masochist doesn't “want” pain, he wants to be able to \nidentify its source, localize it, and so control it.79 Masochism is thus \na way of taking the anxiety of life and death and the overwhelming \nterror of existence and congealing them into a small dosage. One \nthen experiences pain from the terrifying power and yet lives \nthrough it without experiencing the ultimate threat of annihilation \nand death. As Zilboorg so penetratingly observed, the sado-mas­\nochistic combination is the perfect formula for transmuting the fear \nof death.80 Rank called masochism the “small sacrifice,” the “lighter \npunishment,” the “placation” that allows one to avoid the arch­\nevil of death. When applied to sexuality, masochism is thus a way of \ntaking suffering and pain, “which in the last analysis are symbols of \ndeath,” and transmuting them into desired sources of pleasure.81 As \nHenry Hart also observed so well, this is a way of taking self­\nadministered, homeopathic doses; the ego controls total pain, total \ndefeat, and total humiliation by experiencing them in small doses as \na sort of vaccination.82 From still another point of view, then, we \nsee the fascinating ingenuity of the perversions: the turning of pain, \nthe symbol of death, into ecstasy and the experience of more-life. §\nBut again, the limits of the ingenuity of perversion are obvious. \nIf you fix the terror of life and death magically on one person as the \nsource of pain, you control that terror, but you also overinflate that \nperson. This is a private religion that “makes believe” too much and \nso humiliates the masochist by placing him in the power of another\n§ Boss assigns an even more creative intent to sado-masochism, at least in \nsome of its forms (see pp. 104 ff.). I don’t know how far to follow his gen­\neralizations on the basis of the few cases he cites. And I am a little uncom­\nfortable with what seems to be his inclination to accept his patients’ rationaliza­\ntions as really ideal motives. I think this has to be weighed more carefully.\n246 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness247\nperson. No wonder sado-masochism is ultimately belittling, a hot­\nhouse drama of control and transcendence played by pint-sized \ncharacters. All heroism is relative to some kind of “beyond”; the \nquestion is, which kind? This question reminds us of something we \ndiscussed earlier: the problem of too-limited beyonds. From this \npoint of view, perversions are merely a demonstration of the severe \nlimitation of the beyonds one chooses for his drama of heroic \napotheosis^ The sado-masochist is someone who plays out his drama \nof heroism vis-a-vis one person only; he is exercising his two onto­\nlogical motives—Eros and Agape—on the love object alone. On the \none hand, he is using that object to expand his sense of his own full­\nness and power; on the other, giving vent to his need to let go, \nabandon his will, find peace and fulfillment by a total merger with \nsomething beyond him. Romm's patient showed perfectly this \nshrinkage of a cosmic problem to the single partner:\nIn an attempt to relieve his severe tension he struggled between the \nwish to be a dominant male, aggressive and sadistic toward his wife, and \nthe desire to give up his masculinity, be castrated by his wife and thus \nreturn to a state of impotence, passivity and helplessness.83\nHow easy it would be if we could satisfy the yearnings of the whole \nhuman condition safely in the bedroom of our cottage. As Rank put \nit, we want the partner to be like God, all-powerful to support our \ndesires, and all-embracing to merge our desires into—but this is \nimpossible.\nIf, then, sado-masochism reflects the human condition, the acting \nout of our twin ontological motives, we can truly talk about honest \nmasochism, or mature masochism, exactly as Rank did in his unusual \ndiscussion in Beyond Psychology.84 It was one of Freud’s limitations \nthat he could not quite push his thought to this kind of conclusion, \neven though he brushed it repeatedly. He was so impressed by the \nintensity, depth, and universality of sadism and masochism that he \ntermed them instincts. He saw truly that these drives went right to \nthe heart of the human creature. But he drew a pessimistic conclu­\nsion, lamenting the fact that mankind could not get rid of these \ndrives. Again, he was stuck with his instinct theory, which made \nhim see these drives as remnants of an evolutionary condition and"

The maturity of masochism, then, would de­\npend on the object toward which it was directed, on how much in \npossession of himself the mature masochist was. In Ranks view, a \nperson would be neurotic not because he was masochistic but be­\ncause he was not really submissive, but only wanted to make believe \nthat he was.85 Let us dwell on this type of failure briefly, because \nit sums up the whole problem of mental illness that we have \nbroached.\n248 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nMental Illness as Failed Heroics\nOne very interesting and consistent conclusion emerges from our \noverview of mental illness: that Adler was right to say that the \nmentally ill all have a basic problem of courage. They cannot as­\nsume responsibility for their own independent lives; they are hyper­\nfearful of life and death. From this vantage point the theory of \nmental illness is really a general theory of the failures of death- \ntranscendence. The avoidance of life and the terror of death become \nenmeshed in the personality to such an extent that it is crippled— \nunable to exercise the “normal cultural heroism” of other members \nof the society. The result is that the person cannot permit himself \nthe routine heroic self-expansion nor the easy yielding to the super­\nordinate cultural world-view that other members can. This is why \nhe becomes a burden on others in some way. Mental illness, then, \nis also a way of talking about those people who burden others with \ntheir hyperfears of life and death, their own failed heroics.\nAs we have seen, the depressed person is one who has embedded \nhimself so comfortably in the powers and protection of others that \nhe has forfeited his own life. As Adler taught us long ago, the \npeople around the depressed person have to pay for it. Guilt, self- \ntorture, and accusations are also ways of coercing others.86 What is \nmore coercive than the magical transference of the schizophrenic, \nwhich reflects so excellently the failure of courage? Or paranoia, \nwhere the person is so weak and so alone that he creates imaginary\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 249\nobjects of hatred in order to have any relationship at all?87 We have \nto consent to be hated in order that the paranoid can feel some \nsmall measure of vitality. This is the ultimate of “laying one's trip” \non someone else. It is truly a “trip” through life and towards death \nthat weak and frightened people lay especially hard upon others. \nThe point is that we are coerced by the magical transference and \nthe paranoia—and they may not be our problems Ji\nIn the specific perversions we see this coercion in an almost pure \nculture, where it becomes negation of ourselves as whole persons. \nThe reason women object to perverse relationships and are offended \nat the artificial aid that the fetishist uses is precisely that it denies \ntheir existence as whole persons, or as persons ai all.88 What links \nall the perversions is the inability to be a responsible human animal. \nErich Fromm had already well described masochism as an attempt \nto get rid of the burden of freedom.89 Clinically we find that some \npeople are so weak in the face of responsibility that they even fear\nII Nowhere is this clearer than in Waite’s highly researched and carefully \nthought-out paper on Hitler (“Adolf Hitler's Guilt Feelings,” Journal of Inter­\ndisciplinary History, 1971, 1, No. 2: 229-249), in which he argues that six \nmillion Jews were sacrificed to Hitler’s personal sense of unworthiness and \nhypervulnerability of the body to filth and decay. So great were Hider’s \nanxieties about these things, so crippled was he psychically, that he seems to \nhave had to develop a unique perversion to deal with them, to triumph over \nthem. “Hitler gained sexual satisfaction by having a young woman—as much \nyounger than he as his mother was younger than his father—squat over him \nto urinate or defecate on his head” (Ibid., p. 234). This was his “private \nreligion”: his personal transcendence of his anxiety, the hyperexperience and \nresolution of it. This was a personal trip that he laid not only on the Jews \nand the German nation but directly on his mistresses. It is highly significant \nthat each of them committed suicide or tried to do so, and more than a simple \ncoincidence. It might very possibly be that they could not stand the burden \nof his perversion; the whole of it was on them, it was theirs to live with— \nnot in itself, as a simple and disgusting physical act, but in its shattering \nabsurdity and massive incongruity with Hider’s public role. The man who is the \nobject of all social worship, the hope of Germany and the world, the victor \nover evil and filth, is the same one who will in an hour plead with you in \nprivate to “be nice” to him with the fullness of your excretions. I would say \nthat this discordance between private and public esthetics is possibly too much \nto bear, unless one can get some kind of commanding height or vantage point \nfrom which to mock it or otherwise dismiss it, say, as a prostitute would by \nconsidering her client a simple pervert, an inferior form of life.\n\f\n250 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nthe freedom of being in a good state of health and vigor, as Biebei \nreminded us.90 In the most extreme perversion, necrophilia, we sec \nthe most extreme fear of life and of persons, as Fromm has de­\nscribed.91 One of Brills’ patients was so afraid of corpses that when \nhe overcame this fear he became a necrophile because he was \nfascinated by his new-won freedom; we might say that he used \nnecrophilia as his heroics and that undertakers’ parlors were the \nstage for his drama of apotheosis. Corpses are perfect in their help­\nlessness: they can’t possibly hurt you or disgrace you; you don’t \nhave to worry about their safety or their responses.92\nBoss has described a coprophiliac whose existence was so \nshrunken that he could find creative heroics only in the products of \nthe rectum.93 Here we see perfectly the terror of the species role, \nthe inability to relate to the body of the sexual partner. In this \npatient they are so great that they risk cutting him off entirely from \nexpressing his desires in an interpersonal relationship. He is in effect \n“saved” by feces and by his ingenious rationalization that they are \nthe true source of life. Little does it matter to him that the needs \nof his particular heroics have reduced his wife to nothing more than \na rectum. Nothing could be more graphic than the perversions in \nshowing how fear and weakness lead to unlived life and what \ncrippled heroics result. Straus goes so far as to connect necrophilia \nwith miserliness and involutional depression, as part of the same \nproblem of the general retreat from life.94 We have no argument \nwith thft formulation.\nAt this time with our sure theoretical understanding we can skip \nlightly and almost anecdotally over the whole spectrum of mental \niUness^and perversion without much risk: they all refer to the terror \nof the human condition in people who can’t bear up under it. \nPrecisely at this poin t-our.. discussion of the perversions as failed \nheroics once again and finally makes a circle on the whole problem \nof human nature in its ideal dimensions. Heroism, is, after all, an \nideal matter. The problem of mental illness, since Kierkegaard and \nthrough Scheler, Hocking, Jung, Fromm, and many others, has been \ninseparable from the problem of idolatry.95 In what cosmology is \none going to perform his heroics? If—as we have argued—even the \nstrongest person has to exercise his Agape motive, has to lay the \nburden of his life somewhere beyond him, then we are brought once\n\f\nA General View of Mental Illness 251\nagain to the great questions: What is the highest reality, the true \nideal, the really great adventure? What kind of heroism is called for, \nin what kind of drama, submission to what kind of god? The reli­\ngious geniuses of history have argued that to be really submissive \nmeans to be submissive to the highest power, the true infinity and \nabsolute—and not to any human substitutes, lovers, leaders, nation­\nstates.\nFrom this point of view the problem of mental illness is one of \nnot knowing what kind of heroics one is practising or not being \nable—once one does know—to broaden ones heroics from their \ncrippling narrowness. Paradoxical as it may sound, mental illiiess is \nthus a matter of weakness and stupidity. It reflects ignorance about \nhovTOTFiT^ig^Bout satisfying^ twin ontological motives. The \ndesire to affirm oneself and to yield oneself are, after all, very \nneutral: we can choose any path for them, any object, any level of \nheroics. The suffering and the evil that stems from these motives \nare not a consequence of the nature of the motives themselves, but \nof our stupidity about satisfying them. This is the deeper meaning \nof one of Rank’s insights, which otherwise would seem flippant. In \na letter of 1937 he wrote:\nSuddenly . . . while I was resting in bed it occurred to me what really was (or is) \"Beyond Psychology.” You know what? Stupidity! All that complicated and elaborate explanation of human behavior is nothing but an attempt to give a meaning to one of the most powerfulSnotives of behavior, namely stupidity! I began to think that it is even more power­ful than badness, meanness—because many actions or reactions that appear mean are simply stupid and even calling them bad is a justifica­\ntion.96\nFinally, then, we can see how truly inseparable are the domains \nof psychiatry and religion, as they both deal with human nature \nand the ultimate meaning of life. To leave behind stupidity is to \nbecomes aware of life as a problem of heroics, which inevitably \nbecomes a reflection about what life ought to be in its ideal dimen­\nsions. From this point of view we can see that the perversions of \n“private religions” are not \"false” in comparison to “true religions.” \nThey are simply less expansive, less humanly noble and responsible. \nAll living organisms are condemned to perversity, to the narrowness"

In other words, if she paid the price of almost dying, she could have \npleasure without crushing guilt; to be a victim in the sexual act became the \nfetish that permitted it to take place. All of Weismans patients had an image \nof reality and death that was medieval: they saw the world as evil, as over­\nwhelmingly dangerous; they equated disease, defeat, and depravity, just like \nmedieval penitents; and like them, too, they had to become victims in order \nto deserve to remain alive, to buy off death. Weisman calls them aptly “virginal \nromantics,” who cannot stand the blatancy of physical reality and seek to \ntransform it into something more idealized by means of the perversion."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\nPsychology and Religion:  \nW ha t Is the Heroic Individualf\nIf there is any science man really needs it is the \none 1 teach, of how to occupy properly that \nplace in creation that is assigned to man, and how \nto learn from it what one must be \nin order to be a man. \n—Immanuel K a n t\nWhen we are young we are often puzzled by the fact that each \nperson we admire seems to have a different version of what life \nought to be, what a good man is, how to live, and so on. If we are \nespecially sensitive it seems more than puzzling, it is disheartening. \nWhat most people usually do is to follow one person s ideas and \nthen another's, depending on who looms largest on one's horizon at \nthe time. The one with the deepest voice, the strongest appearance, \nthe most authority and success, is usually the one who gets our \nmomentary allegiance; and we try to pattern our ideals after him. \nBut as life goes on we get a perspective on this, and all these dif­\nferent versions of truth become a little pathetic. Each person thinks \nthat he has the formula for triumphing over life's limitations and \nknows with authority what it means to be a man, and he usually \ntries to win a following for his particular patent. Today we know \nthat people try so hard to win converts for their point of view be­\ncause it is more than merely an outlook on life: it is an immortality \nformula. Not everyone, of course, has the authority of Kant speak­\ning the words we have used in our epigraph to this chapter, but in \nmatters of immortality everyone has the same self-righteous convic­\n255\n\f\nTHE DENIAL OF DEATH\ntion. The thing seems perverse because each diametrically opposed \nview is put forth with the same maddening certainty; and au­\nthorities who are equally unimpeachable hold opposite views!\nTake, for example, Freuds seasoned thoughts on human nature, \nand his idea of where he stood on the pyramid of struggling man­\nkind:\n... I have found little that is \"good” about human beings on the whole. \nIn my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they pub­\nlicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or none at all. ... If we are \nto talk of ethics, I subscribe to a high ideal from which most of the \nhuman beings I have come across depart most lamentably.1\nWhen perhaps the greatest psychologist who ever lived lets drop \nthe stock phrase \"in my experience,” it has the authority of a Papal \nBull during medieval times. Of course, he also implies that if most \npeople are trash, some aren’t, and we can surmise who is one of the \nfew exceptions. We are reminded of those once-popular books on \neugenics that always carried a handsome frontispiece photograph \nof the author beaming his vitality and personality as the ideal type \nfor the book’s argument.\nAs we would expect, Freud’s self-evaluation would hardly be \nagreed upon by everyone; almost each of his major dissenting \ndisciples could find something to look down upon him for, with a \ncertain condescending pity. Wilhelm Reich once remarked that \nFreud was caught in the psychoanalytic movement, trapped by his \ndisciples and his own creation, that his very cancer was the result \nof being shut in upon himself, unable to speak as a free agent.2 \nThere’s our problem again, you see: Reich’s judgment would have \ncarried more authority if it had come from a god instead of from a \nman who was even more caught up in his own movement and who \nwas more decisively and ignominiously undone by it. Jung, too, \nthought Freud had great limitations, but he saw these limitations \nas a necessary part of Freud’s diamon, of his genius and peculiar \nmessage. But maybe this understanding was actually a reflection of \nJung’s own demonic drivenness into alchemy, of the almost shaman- \nistic quality of his inner life.3 No less a student of man than Erich \nFromm has written the bitterest lines on Jung, denouncing him as\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual? *57\nan enemy of science. Pity the layman scurrying under the feet of all \nthese giants dropping their weighty pronunciamentos on one \nanother.\nI haven’t even mentioned Rank's powerful views on Freuds \nlimitations. In Rank's system of thought the most generous judg­\nment that might probably be made about Freud's limitations was \nthat he shared the human weakness of the neurotic: he lacked the \ncapacity for illusion, for a creative myth about the possibilities of \ncreation. He saw things too “realistically,” without their aura of \nmiracle and infinite possibility. The only illusion he allowed him­\nself was that of his own science—and such a source is bound to be \na shaky support because it comes from one's own energies and not \nfrom a powerful beyond. This is the problem of the artist generally; \nthat he creates his own new meanings and must, in turn, be \nsustained by them. The dialogue is too inverted to be secure. And \nhence Freud’s lifelong ambivalence about the value of posterity and \nfame, the security of the whole panorama of evolution. We touched \non all these questions in our comparison of Freud and Kierkegaard, \nand now we are back to it. One can only talk about an ideal human \ncharacter from a perspective of absolute transcendence. Kierkegaard \nwould say that Freud still had pride, that he lacked the creature \nconsciousness of the truly analyzed man, that he had not fully \nserved his apprenticeship in the school of anxiety. In Kierkegaard’s \nunderstanding of man, the causa-sui project is the Oedipus com­\nplex, and in order to be a man one has to abandon it completely. \nFrom this point of view Freud still had not analyzed away his \nOedipus complex, no matter how much he and the early psycho­\nanalysts prided themselves that they had. He could not yield emo­\ntionally to superordinate power or conceptually to the transcenden­\ntal dimension. He lived still wholly in the dimension of the visible \nworld and was limited by what was possible in that dimension \nonly; therefore, all his meanings had to come from that dimension.\nKierkegaard had his own formula for what it means to be a man. \nHe put it forth in those superb pages wherein he describes what he \ncalls “the knight of faith.”4 This figure is the man who lives in \nfaith, who has given over the meaning of life to his Creator, and \nwho lives centered on the energies of his Maker. He accepts what­\never happens in this visible dimension without complaint, lives his\n\f\nlife as a duty, faces his death without a qualm. No pettiness is so \npetty that it threatens his meanings; no task is too frightening to bo \nbeyond his courage. He is fully in the world on its terms and wholly \nbeyond the world in his trust in the invisible dimension. It is very \nmuch the old Pietistic ideal that was lived by Kants parents. The \ngreat strength of such an ideal is that it allows one to be open, \ngenerous, courageous, to touch others' lives and enrich them and \nopen them in turn. As the knight of faith has no fear-of-life-and- \ndeath trip to lay onto others, he does not cause them to shrink back \nupon themselves, he does not coerce or manipulate them. The \nknight of faith, then, represents what we might call an ideal of \nmental health, the Continuing openness^of life out of TKe “death \nthroes of dread.\nPut in these abstract terms the ideal of the knight of faith is \nsurely one of the most beautiful and challenging ideals ever put \n, forth by man. It is contained in most religions in one form or \nanother although no one, I think, has described it at length with \nsuch talent at Kierkegaard. Like all ideals it is a creative illusion, \nmeant to lead men on, and leading men on is not the easiest tiling. \nAs Kierkegaard said, faith is the hardest thing; he placed himself \nbetween belief and faith, unable to make the jump. The jump \ndoesn't depend 011 man after all—-there's the rub: faith is a matter \nof grace. As Tillich later put it: religion is first an open hand to \nreceive gifts (grace) and then a closed hand to give them. One \ncannot give the gifts of the knight of faith without first being \ndubbed a knight by some Higher Majesty. The point I am driving at \nis that if we take Kierkegaards life as a believing Christian and \nplace it against Freud's as an agnostic, there is no balance sheet to \ndraw. Who is to tally up which one caused others to shrink up more \nor to expand more fully? For every shortcoming that we can point \nto in Freud, we can find a corresponding one in Kierkegaard. If \nFreud can be said to have erred on the side of the visible, then \nKierkegaard can surely be said to have equally erred on the side of \nthe invisible. He turned away from life partly from his fear of life, \nhe embraced death more easily because he had failed in life; his \nown life was not a voluntary sacrifice undertaken in free will, but a \npathetically driven sacrifice. He did not live in the categories in \nwhich he thought.5\n258 THE DENIA'L OF DEATH\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?*5 9\nI am talking matter-of-factly about some of the surest giants in \nthe history of humanity only to say that in the game of life and \ndeath no one stands taller than any other, unless it be a true saint, \nand only to conclude that sainthood itself is a matter of grace and \nnot of human effort. My point is that for man not everything is \npossible. What is there to choose between religious creatureliness \nand scientific creatureliness? The most one can achieve is a certain \nrelaxedness, an openness to experience that makes him less of a \ndriven burden on others. And a lot of this depends on how much \ntalent he has, how much of a daimon is driving him; it is easier to \nlay down light burdens than heavy ones. How does a man create \nfrom all his living energies a system of thought, as Freud did, a \nsystem directed wholly to the problems of this world, and then just \ngive it up to the invisible one? How, in other words, can one be a \nsaint and still organize scientific movements of world-historical im­\nportance? How does one lean on God and give over everything to \nHim and still stand on his own feet as a passionate human being? \nThese are not rhetorical questions, they are real ones that go right\n..problem that\nno one can satisfactorily advise anyone else on, as the wise William \nJames knew. The whole thing is loaded with ambiguity impossible \nto resolve. As James said, each person sums up a whole range of \nvery personal experiences so that his life is a very unique problem \nneeding very individual kinds of solutions. Kierkegaard had said \nthat same thing when he answered those who objected to his life \nstyle: he said it was singular because it was the one singularly de\\ \nsigned to be what he needed in order to live; it is as simple and as/ \nfinal as that.\nJames, again, knew how difficult it was to live astride both worlds, \nthe visible and the invisible. One tended to pull you away from the \nother. One of his favorite precepts, which he often repeated, was: \n“Son of man, stand upon your own feet so that I may speak with \nyou.” If men lean too much on God they don't accomplish what they \nhave to in this world on their own powers. In order to do anything \none must first be a man, apart from everything else. This throws the \nwhole splendid ideal of sainthood into doubt because there are \nmany ways of being a good man. Was Norman Bethune any less a \nsaint than Vincent de Paul? That, I suppose, is another way of say-\n\f\n26 o THE DENIAL OF DEATH\ning that in this world each organism lives to be consumed by its \nown energies; and those that are consumed with the most relent­\nlessness, and bum with the brightest flame, seem to serve the pur­\nposes of nature best, so far as accomplishing anything on this planet \nis concerned. It is another way, too—with Rank—of talking about \nthe priority of the “irrational” life force that uses organismic forms \n\\only to consume them.\nThe Impossible Heroism\nIn the light of all this ambiguity we can take an understanding \nlook at some of the modem prophets on human nature. I have been \nsaying that a man cannot evolve beyond his character, that he is \nstuck with it. Goethe said that a man cannot get rid of his nature \neven if he throws it away; to which we can add—even if he tries to \nthrow it to God. Now it is time to see that if a man cannot evolve \nbeyond his character, he surely cant evolve without character. This \nbrings up one of the great debates in contemporary thought. If we \ntalk about the irrational life force living the limitations of organisms, \nwe are not going to take the next step and get carried away into \nabstractions that are so popular today, abstractions in which the \nlife force suddenly and miraculously seems to emerge from nature \nwithout any limits. I am referring, of course, to the new prophet- \nicism of people like Marcuse, Brown, and so many others, on what \nman may achieve, what it really means to be a man. I promised at \nthe beginning of this book to linger a bit on the details of this \nproblem, and now is the time for it.\nTake Norman Browns Life Against Death: rarely does a work of \nthis brilliance appear. Rarely does a book so full of closely reasoned \nargument, of very threatening argument, achieve such popularity; \nbut like most other foundation-shaking messages, this one is popular \nfor all the wrong reasons. It is prized not for its shattering revela­\ntions on death and anality, but for its wholly non-sequitur conclu­\nsions: for its plea for the unrepressed life, the resurrection of the \nbody as the seat of primary pleasure, the abolition of shame and \nguilt. Brown concludes that mankind can only transcend the terrible"

If mankind would do this, says Brown, \nthen the fear of death will no longer drive it to folly, waste, and \ndestruction; men will have their apotheosis in eternity by living fully \nin the now of experience.6 The enemy of mankind is basic repres­\nsion, the denial of throbbing physical life and the spectre of death. \nThe prophetic message is for the wholly unrepressed life, which \nwould bring into birth a new man. A few lines of Brown's own \nwords give us his key message:\nIf we can imagine an unrepressed man—a man strong enough to live \nand therefore strong enough to die, and therefore what no man has ever \nbeen, an individual—such a man [would have] . . . overcome guilt and \nanxiety. . . .  In such a man would be fulfilled on earth the mystic hope \nof Christianity, the resurrection of the body, in a form, as Luther said, \nfree from death and filth. . . . With such a transfigured body the human \nsoul can be reconciled, and the human ego become once more what it \nwas designed to be in the first place, a body-ego and the surface of a \nbody. . . . The human ego would have to become strong enough to die; \nand strong enough to set aside guilt. . . . [F]ull psychoanalytic conscious­\nness would be strong enough to cancel the debt [of guilt] by deriving it \nfrom infantile fantasy.7\nWhat is one to say about such an eloquent program when it flies \nin the face of everything we know about man and most of what \nBrown himself has written about human character in the preceding \nalmost 300 pages? These few lines contain fallacies so obvious that \none is shocked that a thinker of Browns power could even let them \nlinger in his mind, much less put them down as reasoned argu­\nments. Once again and always we are back to basic things that we \nhave not shouted loud enough from the rooftops or printed in big- \nenough block letters: jjuilt is not a result of infantile fantasy but of \nself-conscious adult reality. There is no strength that can overcome \nguilt unless it be the strength of a god; and there is no way to \novercome creature anxiety unless one is a god and not a creature. \nThe child denies the reality of his world as miracle and as terror; \nthat’s all there is to it.

L. Stevenson, who haven't blunted their receptors to raw ex­\nperience:\nAs I go on in this life, day by day, I become more of a bewildered child; \nI cannot get used to this world, to procreation, to heredity, to sight, to \nhearing; the commonest things are a burthen. The prim, obliterated, \npolite surface of life, and the broad, bawdy, and orgiastic—or maenadic \n—foundations, form a spectacle to which no habit reconciles me.8\nBrown's whole vision of some future man falls flat on the one failure \nto understand guilt.9 It does not derive from “infantile fantasy” but \nfrom reality.\nIn other words—and this too is crucial enough to bear stressing \none final time—the child “represses himself.” He takes over the \ncontrol of his own body as a reaction to the totality of experience, \nnot' only to his own desires. As Rank so exhaustively and defini­\ntively lirgu^child's  problems are existential: they refer to his \ntotal world—what bodies are for, what to do with them, what is the \nmeaning of all this creation.10 Repression fulfills the vital function of \nallowing the child to act without anxiety, to take experience in hand \nand develop dependable responses to it. How could we ever get a \nnew man without guilt and anxiety if each child, in order to become \nhuman, necessarily puts limits on his ego? There can be no birth \nin “second innocence''11 because we would get a repetition of the \nvery dynamics that Brown deplores, dynamics that rule out the \npossibility of the terrors of innocence.

    "raw_text": "the forebrain, the power to symbolize, to delay experience, to bind \ntime, was not “'intended” by nature and so represents a self-defeat \nembodied in an improbable animal? The ego, on the contrary, \nrepresents the immense broadening of experience and potential \ncontrol, a step into a true kind of sub-divinity in nature. Life in the \nbody is not “all we have”12 if we have an ego. And the ego repre­\nsents, lisTaF as we can judge, a natural urge by the life force_i_t££}f \ntov^d”arTexpansion of experience, toward more life. If the urge \ntoward more life is^air^^lutronary BliHi(ier7\"t}ien we are calling\nour own preferences about what “more-life” ought j o be. Admittedly, \nwhen evolution gave man a self, an inner symbolic world of ex­\nperience, it split him in two, gave him an added burden. But this \nburden seems to be the price that had to be paid in order for or­\nganisms to attain more life, for the development of the life force on \nthe furthest reach of experience and self-consciousness. Brown \nclaims that the “reunification of the ego and the body is not a dis­\nsolution but a strengthening of the human ego.”13 But this one \nphrase in passing rings hollow because it is truly empty chatter that \navoids facing everything we know about the ego. To talk about a \n“new man” whose ego merges wholly with his body is to talk about \na subhuman creature, not a superhuman one.\nThe ego, in order to develop at all, must deny, must bind time, \nmust stop the body. In other words, the kind of new man that \nBrown himself wants would have to have an ego in order to ex­\nperience his body, which means that the ego has to disengage itself \nfrom the body and oppose it. That is another way of saying that the \nchild must be blocked in his experience in order to be able to \nregister that experience. If we don’t “stop” the child he develops \nvery little sense of himself, he becomes an automaton, a reflex of \nthe surface of his world playing upon his own surface. Clinically \nwe have huge documentation for this character type whom we call \nthe psychopath; phenomenologically we have understood this since \nDewey’s Experience and Nature.14 Brown’s whole thesis falls then, \non a twin failure: not only on his failure to understand the real \npsychodynamics of guilt, but also his turning his back on how the \nchild registers experience on his body: the need to develop in a \ndualistic way in order to be a rich repository of life.15\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual? 263\n\f\nFor a thinker of Brown’s breadth and penetration these failures \nare rather uncanny, and we realize them with a sense of reluctance, \nof unwillingness to find such glaring lapses in what is really a \nthinker of heroic dimensions. I am less upset when I find similar \nlapses in Marcuse, who is a much less daring reinterpreter of Freud \nbut who puts forth a similar call for a new kind of unrepressed man. \nOn the one hand Marcuse calls for a revolution of unrepression be­\ncause he knows that it is not enough to change the structure of \nsociety in order to bring a new world into being; the psychology of \nman also has to be changed. But on the other hand, he admits that \nunrepression is impossible, because there is death: “The brute fact \nof death denies once and for all the reality of a non-repressive ex­\nistence.”18 The closing pages of his book are a realistic and regret- \nfuljidmission fhat-tha-ego-has IflL^preadJtseHTSey^ pleasures \nof the body in order for men to be men. But the dedicated social \nrevolutionary who wants a new worlcHmd a new man more than \nanything else can’t accept the reality that he himself sees. He still \nbelieves in the possibility of some kind of “final liberation,” which \nalso rings like the hollow, passing thought that it is. Marcuse even \nturns his back wholly on living experience and gets carried away \nby his abstractions: “Men can die without anxiety if they know that \nwhat they love is protected from misery and oblivion [by the new \nutopian society].”17 As if men could ever know that, as if you and I \ncan be sure at any instant that our children will not be obliterated \nby a senseless accident or that the whole planet will not be smashed \nby a gigantic meteor.\nWhy do brilliant thinkers become so flaccid, dissipate so care­\nlessly their own careful arguments? Probably because they see their \ntask as a serious and gigantic one: the critique of an entire way of \nlife; and they see themselves in an equally gigantic prophetic role: \nto point to a way out once and for all, in the most uncompromising \nterms. This is why their popularity is so great: they are prophets \nand simplifiers. Like Brown, Marcuse wants a sure indicator of \nalienation, a focal point in nature, and finds it in the ideology and \nfear of death. Being a true revolutionary he wants to change this in \nhis lifetime, wants to see a new world born. He is so committed to \nthis fulfillment that he cannot allow himself to stop in midstream \nand follow out the implications of his own reservations on unrepres-\n264 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?265\nsion, his own admissions about the inevitable grip of death; fear of \ndeath is obviously deeper than ideology. To admit this would make \nhis whole thesis ambiguous—and what revolutionary wants that?\nHe would have to put forth a program that is not totally revolu­\ntionary, that allows for repression, that questions what men may \nbecome, that sees how inevitably men work against their own better \ninterests, how they must shut out life and pleasure, follow irrational \nhero-systems—that there is a demonism in human affairs that even \nthe greatest and most sweeping revolution cannot undo. With an \nadmission like this Marcuse would be an anomaly—a \"tragic revolu­\ntionary”—and would dissipate his role as a straightforward prophet. \nWho can expect him to do that?\nThere is no point in lingering on the fallacies of the revolu­\ntionaries of unrepression; one could go on and on, but everything \nwould come back to the same basic thing: the impossibility of living \nwithout repression. No one has argued this impossibility with more \nauthority and style than Philip Rieff in his recent work, and so far \nas I can see it should lay the matter to rest.18 He turns the whole \nmovement on end: repression is not falsification of the world, it is J \n“truth”—the only truth that man can know, because he cannot ex- \\ \nperience everything. Rieff is calling us back to basic Freudianism, 1 \nto a stoical acceptance of the limits of life, the burdens of it and of \nourselves. In a particularly beautiful phrase, he puts it this way:\nThe heaviest crosses are internal and men make them so that, thus \nskeletally supported, they can bear the burden of their flesh. Under the \nsign of this inner cross, a certain inner distance is achieved from the \ninfantile desire to be and have everything.19\njsRiftffs point is the classical one: that in order to have a truly human—, \nI existence there must be limits;, .and jafliat we call culture or the \n\" sup^ego^ sHs s limits) Culture is a compromise with life that \nmakelliimifltL life possible. He quotes Marx’s defiant revolutionary \n>pfrras€f1l  am nothing and should be everything.” For Rieff this is \nthe undiluted infantile unconscious speaking. Or, as I would prefer \nto say with Rank, the neurotic consciousness—the “all or nothing” \nof the person who cannot “partialize” his world. One bursts out in \nboundless megalomania, transcending all limits, or bogs down into\n\f\n266 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nwormhood like a truly worthless sinner. There is no secure ego \nbalance to limit the intake of reality or to fashion the output of ones \nown powers.\nIf there is tragic limitation in life there is also possibility. jWhat \nwe call maturity is the ability to see the two in some kind of balance \ninto whicITwe canTTt creatively. As Rie3^j^\"it: ^Character is the \nrestrictive sha^mg~oF^ossiBiIity.?,2() It all boils down, again, to the \nfact that the prophets of unrepression simply have not understood \nhuman nature; they envisage a utopia with perfect freedom from \ninner constraint and from outer authority. This idea flies in the face \nof the fundamental dynamism of unfreedom that we have dis­\ncovered in each individual: the universality of transference. This \nfact is hardly lost on Rieff, who realizes that men need transference \nbecause they like to see their morality embodied, need some kind of \npoints of support in the endless flux of nature:\nAbstractions will never do. God-terms have to be exemplified. . . . Men \ncrave their principles incarnate in enactable characters, actual selective \nmediators between themselves and the polytheism of experience.21\nThis failure to push the understanding of psychodynamics to its \nlimits is the hurdle that none of the Utopians can get over; it finally \nvitiates their best arguments. I am thinking here, too, of Alan Har­\nrington’s tremendously effective writing on fear of death as the \nmainspring of human conduct. Like Brown he pins an entirely \nfanciful and self-defeating thesis onto the most penetrating and \ndamaging insights. Is fear of death the enemy? Then the cure is \nobvious: abolish death. Is this fanciful? No, he answers, science is \nworking on the problem; admittedly, we may not be able to abolish \ndeath entirely, but we can prolong life to a great extent—who \nknows how much eventually. We can envisage a utopia wherein \npeople will have such long lives that the fear of death will drop \naway, and with it the fiendish drivenness that has haunted man so \nhumiliatingly and destructively all through his history and now \npromises to bring him total self-defeat. Men will then be able to live \nin an “eternal now” of pure pleasure and peace, become truly the \ngodlike creatures that they have the potential to be.22\nAgain, the modern Utopians continue the one-sided Enlighten­\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?267\nment dream. Condorcet had already had the identical vision in \n1794:\n. . .  a period must one day arrive when death will be nothing more than \nthe effect either of extraordinary accidents, or of the slow and gradual \ndecay of the vital powers: and that the duration of the interval between \nthe birth of man and his decay will have itself no assignable limit.23\nBut Choron offers a caution on this vision that goes right to heart of \nit and demolishes it: that the ‘postponement of death is not a solu­\ntion to the problem of the fear of death . . . there still will remain \nthe fear of dying prematurely.”24 The smallest virus or the stupidest \naccident would deprive a man not of 90 years but of 900—and would \nbe then 10 times more absurd. Condorcet’s failure to understand \npsychodynamics was forgivable, but not Harringtons today. If \nsomething is 10 times more absurd it is 10 times more threatening. \nIn other words, death would be “hyperfetishized” as a source of \ndanger, and men in the utopia of longevity would be even less ex­\npansive and peaceful than they are today!\nI see this utopia in one way resembling the beliefs of many \nprimitive societies. They denied that death was the total end of \nexperience and believed instead that it was the final ritual promo­\ntion to a higher form of life. This meant too that invisible spirits of \nthe dead had power over the living, and if someone died pre­\nmaturely it was thought to be the result of malevolent spirits or the \nbreach of taboos. Premature death did not come as an impersonal \naccident. This reasoning meant that primitive man put the highest \npriority on ways to avoid bad will and bad action, which is why he \nseems to have circumscribed his activities in often compulsive and \nphobic ways.25 Tradition has laid a heavy hand over men every­\nwhere. Utopian man might live in the same “eternal now” of the \nprimitives, but undoubtedly too with the same real compulsivity \nand phobia. Unless one is talking about real immortality one is \ntalking merely about an intensification of the character defenses and \nsuperstitions of man. Curiously, Harrington himself seems to sense \nthis, when he speculates on what kind of gods the Utopians would \nworship:\n\f\n268 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n. . . the children of eternity may worship variations of Luck, or That \nWhich Cannot Be Controlled. . . . Luck will be . . . the only thing that \ncan kill them, and for this reason they may go down on their knees \nbefore it. . . . [They] may conduct ceremonies before the future \nequivalent of a giant slot machine or roulette wheel.26\nSome godlike creatures! The fallacy in all this sterile utopianism is \nthat fear of death is not the only motive of life; heroic tran­\nscendence, victory over evil for mankind as a whole, for unborn \ngenerations, consecration of ones existence to higher meanings— \nthese motives are just as vital and they are what give the human \nanimal his nobility even in the face of his animal fears. Hedonism \nis not heroism for most men. The pagans in the ancient world did \nnot realize that and so lost out to the “despicable” creed of Judeo- \nChristianity. Modern men equally do not realize it, and so they sell \ntheir souls to consumer capitalism or consumer communism or re­\nplace their souls—as Rank said—with psychology. Psychotherapy is \nsuch a growing vogue today because people want to know why they \nare unhappy in hedonism and look for the faults within themselves. \nUnrepression has become the only religion after Freud—as Philip \nRieff so well argued in a recent book; evidently he did not realize \nthat his argument was an updating and expansion of exactly what \nRank had maintained about the historical role of psychology.27\nThe Limits of Psychotherapy\nAs we have already covered this problem in Chapter Four where \nwe first broached the dilemma of life, let us refresh our memories \nhere. We saw that there really was no way to overcome the real \ndilemma of existence, the one of the mortal animal who at the same \ntime is conscious of his mortality. A person spends years coming \ninto his own, developing his talent, his unique gifts, perfecting his \ndiscriminations about the world, broadening and sharpening his \nappetite, learning to bear the disappointments of life, becoming \nmature, seasoned—finally a unique creature in nature, standing with \nsome dignity and nobility and transcending the animal condition;"

And then the real tragedy, as Andre Malraux wrote in \nThe Human Condition: that it takes sixty years of incredible suffer­\ning and effort to make such an indlyiduairand then he is good only \nTor dying1 This painful paradox is not lost on the person himselF^ \nleast of all himself. He feels agonizingly unique, and yet he knows \nthat this doesn’t make any difference as far as ultimates are con­\ncerned. He has to go the way of the grasshopper, even though it \ntakes longer.\nWe said that the point was that even with the highest personal \ndevelopment and liberation, the person comes up against the real \ndespair of the human condition. Indeed, because of that develop­\nment his eyes are opened to the reality of things; there is no turn­\ning back to the comforts of a secure and armored life. The person \nis stuck with the full problem of himself, and yet he cannot rely on \nhimself to make any sense out of it. For such a person, as Camus \nsaid, “the weight of days is dreadful.” What does it mean, then, we \nquestioned in Chapter Four, to talk fine-sounding phrases like \n“Being cognition,” “the fully centered person,” “full humanism,” \n“the joy of peak experiences,” or whatever, unless we seriously \nqualify such ideas with the burden and the dread that they also \ncarry? Finally, with these questions we saw that we could call into \ndoubt the pretensions of the whole therapeutic enterprise. What \njoy and comfort can it give to fully awakened people? Once you \naccept the truly desperate situation that man is in, you come to see \nnot only that neurosis is normal, but that even psychotic failure \nrepresents only a little additional push in the routine stumbling \nalong life’s way. If repression makes an untenable life liveable, self- \nknowledge can entirely destroy it for some people. Rank was very \nsensitive to this problem and talked about it intimately. I would \nlike to quote him at length here in an unusually mature and sober \npsychoanalytic reflection that sums up the best of Freud’s own \nstoical world-picture:\nA woman comes for consultation; what’s the matter with her? She suffers \nfrom some kind of intestinal symptoms, painful attacks of some kind of \nintestinal trouble. She had been sick for eight years, and has tried every \nkind of physical treatment. . . . She came to the conclusion it must be\n\f\n270 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nsome emotional trouble. She is unmarried, she is thirty-five. She appears \nto me (and admits it herself) as being fairly well adjusted. She lives with \na sister who is married; they get along well. She enjoys life, goes to the \ncountiy in the summer. She has a little stomach trouble; why not keep it, \n( I tell her, because if we are able to take away those attacks that como \n\\ once in a fortnight or so, we do not know what problem we shall discover \nibeneath it. Probably this defense mechanism is her adjustment, probably \n£that is the price she has to pay. She never married, she never loved, and \nso never fulfilled her role. One cannot ever have everything, probably \nshe has to pay. After all, what difference does it make if she occasionally \ngets these attacks of indigestion? I get it occasionally, you do too, prob­\nably, and not for physical reasons, as you may know. One gets head­\naches. In other words, it is not so much a question as to whether we are \nable to cure a patient, whether we can or not, but whether we should \n^  or not.28\nNo organismic life can be straightforwardly self-expansive in all \ndirections; each one must draw back into himself in some areas, pay \nsome penalty of a severe kind for his natural fears and limitations. \nIt is all right to say, with Adler, that mental illness is due to “prob­\nlems in living,”— but we must remember that life itself is the in- \ni surmountable problem.\nThis is not to say that psychotherapy cannot give great gifts to \ntortured and overwhelmed people and even added dignity to any­\none who values and can use self-knowledge. Psychotherapy can \nallow people to affirm themselves, to smash idols that constrict the \nself-esteem, to lift the load of neurotic guilt—the extra guilt piled \non top of natural existential guilt. It can clear away neurotic des­\npair—the despair that comes from a too-constricted focus for ones \nsafety and satisfactions. When a person becomes less fragmented, \nless blocked and bottled up, he does experience real joy: the joy of \nfinding more of himself, of the release from armor and binding re­\nflexes, of throwing off the chains of uncritical and self-defeating \ndependency, of controlling his own energies, of discovering aspects \nof the world, intense experience in the present moment that is now \nfreer of prefixed perceptions, new possibilities of choice and action, \nand so on. Yes, psychotherapy can do all these things, but there are \nmany things it cannot do, and they have not been aired widely \nenough. Often psychotherapy seems to promise the moon: a more"

It seems to promise that these things are easy to come by, \nonce self-knowledge is achieved, that they are things that should \nand could characterize ones whole waking awareness. As one pa­\ntient said, who had just undergone a course in ‘primal scream” \ntherapy: “I feel so fantastic and wonderful, but this is only a begin­\nning—wait till you see me in five years, it’ll be tremendous?’ We \ncan only hope that she won’t be too unhappy.

Yet we see the \nbooks by th^ mind-healers with their garish titles: “Joy!” “Awaken­\ning,” and the like; we see them in person in lecture halls or in \ngroups, beaming their peculiar brand of inward, confident well­\nbeing, so that it communicates its unmistakable message: we can do \nthis for you, too, if you will only let us. I have never seen or heard \nthem communicate the dangers of the total liberation that they \nclaim to offer; say, to put up a small sign next to the one advertising \njoy, carrying some inscription like “Danger: real probability of the \nawakening of terror and dread, from which there is no turning \nback.” It would be honest and would also relieve them of some of \nthe guilt of the occasional suicide that takes place in therapy.\nBut it would also be most difficult to take the straightforward \nprescription for paradise on earth and make it ambiguous; one can­\nnot be a functioning prophet with a message that he half takes back, \nespecially if he needs paying customers and devoted admirers. The \npsychotherapists are caught up in contemporary culture and are \nforced to be a part of it. Commercial industrialism promised West­\nern man a paradise on earth, described in great detail by the Holly­\nwood Myth, that replaced the paradise in heaven of the Christian \nmyth. Ana no\\. psycnology must replace them both with the myth \nof paradise through self-knowledge. This is the promise of psy­\nchology, and for the most part the psychotherapists are obliged to \nlive it and embody it. But it was Rank who saw how false this \nclaim is. “Psychology as self-knowledge is self-deceptiorL” he said, \nbecause-, it does not give what men want. wHdia^immortalifcy, \nNothing could be plainer.

    "raw_text": "he has lived under—both in its personal-parental form (living in the \nprotective powers of the parents or their surrogates) and in its \ncultural causa-sui form (living by the opinions of others and in the \nsymbolic role-dramatization of the society). What new immortality \nideology can the self-knowledge of psychotherapy provide to re­\nplace this? Obviously, none from psychology—unless, said Rank, \npsychology itself becomes the new belief system.\nNow there are only three ways, I think, that psychology itself can \nbecome an adequate belief system. One of them is to be a creative \ngenius as a psychologist and to use psychology as the immortality \nvehicle for oneself—as Freud and subsequent psychoanalysts have \ndone. Another is to use the language and concepts of psychotherapy \nin much of ones waking life, so that it becomes a lived belief sys­\ntem. We see this often, as ex-patients analyze their motives in all \nsituations when they feel anxious: “this must be penis-envy, this \nmust be incestuous attraction, castration fear, Oedipal rivalry, poly­\nmorphous perversity,” and so on. I met one young person who was \nnearly driven crazy and perverse trying to live the motivational \nvocabularly of the new Freudian religion. But in a way this attitude \nis forced because religion is an experience and not merely a set of \nintellectual concepts to meditate on; it has to be lived. As the psy­\nchologist Paul Bakan penetratingly remarked, this is one of the \nreasons that psychotherapy has moved away from the Freudian \nintellectual model to the new experiential model.29 If psychology is \nto be the modern religion, then it has to reflect lived experience; \nit has to move away from mere talking and intellectual analysis to \nthe actual screaming out of the “traumas of birth” and childhood, \nthe acting-out of dreams and hostility, and so on. What this does is \nto make the hour of psychotherapy itself a ritual experience: an \ninitiation, a holy excursion into a tabooed and sacred realm. The \npatient imbibes another dimension of life, one previously unknown \nto him and unsuspected by him, truly a “mystery religion” separate \nfrom the everyday secular world; he engages in behaviors that are \nvery esoteric and permit the expression of aspects of his personality \nthat he never thought of expressing or even imagined that he had. \nAs in any religion, the adept “swears by” it because he has lived it; \nthe therapy is “true” because it is a lived experience explained by \nconcepts that seem perfectly to fit it, that give form to what the pa­\ntient actually is undergoing*\n272 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?*73\nThe third and final way is merely an extension and sophistication \nof this. It is to take psychology and deepen it with religious and \nmetaphysical associations so that it becomes actually a religious\n* belief system with some breadth and depth. At the same time, the \n\\ psychotherapist himself beams out the steady and quiet power of \n^ transference and becomes the guru-figure of the religion. No wonder \nwe are seeing such a proliferation of psychological gurus in our \nj time. It is the perfect and logical development of the fetishization \nof psychology as a belief system. It extends that system into its \nnecessary dimension, which is immortality and the life-enhancing \npower that goes with it. This power comes in two forms: from the \nconcepts of the religion and concretely from the person of the guru- \ntherapist. It is no coincidence that one of the very popular forms of \ntherapy today—called Gestalt therapy—for the most part ignores \nthe problem of transference, as though one can shoo it away by \nI  turning one's back on it.30 Actually, what is happening is that the \naura of guru infallibility remains intact and provides an automatic \nshelter for the patients deep yearnings for safety and security. It \nis no accident, either, that the therapists who practice these guru \ntherapies cultivate themselves with halo-like beards and hairdos, to \nlook the part they play.\nI am not implying dishonesty here at all, merely that men tend \nto get caught up in the appropriateness of the panoplies they use \nand need. If one senses therapeutic religion as a cultural need, then \nit is the highest idealism to try and fill that need with one's heart \n, and soul. On the other hand, even with the best intentions, trans­\nference is, willy-nilly, a process of indoctrination. Many psycho­\nanalysts, as we know, try very conscientiously to analyze the trans­\nference; others try to minimize it. Despite the best efforts, tne \npatient usually becomes in some way a slavish admirer of the man \nand the techniques of his liberation, however small it is. We already \nknow that one of the reasons that Freud's influence on ideas was so \ngreat was that many of the leading thinkers of our time underwent \nFreudian analysis and so came away with a personal, emotional \nstake in the Freudian world-view.\nThe thing about transference is that it takes root very subtly, all \nthe while that the person seems to be squarely on his own feet^A \nperson^air^eindoctrinated into a world-view thaTTie\"comes to \nbeHeve~without suspecting that he may have embraced it because"

    "raw_text": "274 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nof his relationship to a therapist or a master. We find this in very \nsubtle form in those therapies that seek to put man back into con­\ntact with his own “authentic self,” meaning the pristine powers that \nare locked inside him. The person is enjoined to try to tap these \npowers, this inside of nature, to dig down deeply into the sub­\njectivity of his organism. The theory is that as one progressively \npeels away the social fa5ade, the character defenses, the uncon­\nscious anxieties, he then gets down to his \"‘real self,” the source of \nvitality and creativity behind the neurotic shield of character. In \norder to make psychology a complete belief system, all the therapist \nhas to do is to borrow words for the inner depths of the personality \nfrom traditional mystical religions: it can be called, variously, “the \ngreat void,” the “inner room” of Taoism, the “realm of essence,” \nthe source of things, the “It,” the “Creative Unconscious,” or what­\never.\nThe whole thing seems very logical, factual, and true to nature: \nman peels away his armor and unfolds his inner self, primal energies \nfrom the ground of his being in which he takes root. The person is, \nafter all, not his own creator; he is sustained at all times by the \nworkings of his physiochemistry—and, beneath that, of his atomic \nand subatomic structure. These structures contain within themselves \nthe immense powers of nature, and so it seems logical to say that we \nare being constantly “created and sustained” out of the “invisible \nvoid.” How can one be betrayed by therapy if he is being brought \nback to primary realities? It is obvious from techniques like Zen that \nthe initiation into the world of the “It” takes place by a process of \nbreakdown and reintegration. This process is much like Western \ntherapy wherein the mask of society is peeled away and the driven­\nness is relaxed. In Zen, however, it is the primal powers that now \nare supposed to take over, to act through the person as he opens \nhimself up for them; he becomes their tool and their vehicle. In Zen \narchery, for example, the archer no longer himself shoots the arrow \nat the target, but “It” shoots; the interior of nature erupts into the \nworld through the disciple's perfect selflessness and releases the \nstring. First the disciple has to go through a long process of attun­\ning himself to his own interior, which takes place by means of a \nlong subjection to a master, to whom one remains a lifelong disciple, \na convert to his world-view. If the disciple is lucky he will even get\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?275\nfrom the master one of his bows, which contains his personal spirit \npowers; the transference is sealed in a concrete gift. From all Hindu \ndiscipleship too, the person comes away with a master without \nwhom, usually, he is lost and cannot function; he needs the master \nhimself periodically, or his picture, or his messages through the \nmail, or at least the exact technique that the master used: the head- \nstands, the breathing, and so on. These become the fetishized, \nmagical means of recapturing the power of the transference figure, \nso that when one does them, all is well. The disciple can now stand \non “his own” feet, be “his own” person.\nThe fusion of psychology and religion is thus not only logical, it \nis necessary if the religion is to work. There is no way of standing \non one's own center without outside support, only now this support \nis made to seem to come from the inside. The person is conditioned \nto function under his own control, from his own center, from the \nspiritual powers that well up within him. Actually, of course, the \nsupport comes from the transference certification by the gurujhat \nwhat the disciple is doing is true and good7^ven~reconditioning \niSody^therapies like that of the once-noted F. M. Alexander today \nliberally sprinkle their therapy with ideas from Zen and cite their \n/affinity to people like Gurdjieff. There seems no way to get the body \nto reintegrate without giving it some kind of magical sustaining \npower; at least, there is no better way to win full discipleship to a \n'feligion than by making it frankly religious.31\nIt is no wonder that when therapies strip man down to his naked \naloneness, to the real nature of experience and the problem of life, \nthey slip into some kind of metaphysic of power and justification \nfrom beyond. How can the person be left there trembling and \nalone? Offer him the possibility of mystical contact with the void \nof creation, the power of “It,” his likeness to God, or at the very \nleast the support of a guru who will vouch for these things in his \nown overpowering and harmonious-appearing person. Man must \nreach out for support to a dream, a metaphysic of hope that sus­\ntains him and makes his life worthwhile. To talk about hope is to \ngive the right focus to the problem. It helps us understand why \npeven the thinkers of great stature who got at the heart of human \nI problems could not rest content with the view of the tragical nature \n\\jf man’s lot that this knowledge gives,. It is today well known how\n\f\nWilhelm Reich continued the Enlightenment in the direction of a \nfusion of Freud with Marxist social criticism, only to reach finally \nfor Orgone, the primal cosmic energy. Or how Jung wrote an in­\ntellectual apologia for the text of ancient Chinese magic, the I \nChing. In this, as Rieff has so bitingly argued, these men are of \nlesser stature than their master the great Stoic Freud.32\n276 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nThe Limits of Human Nature\nIn our earlier discussion of what is possible for man, we said that \na person is stuck with his character, that he can't evolve beyond it \nor without it. If there is a limit to what man can be, we now also \nmust conclude that there is a limit even to what religious therapy \ncan do for him. But the psychotherapeutic religionists are claiming \njust the opposite: that the life force can miraculously emerge from \nnature, can transcend the body it uses as a vehicle, and can break \nthe bounds of human character. They claim that man as he now is \ncan be merely a vehicle for the emergence of something totally \nnew, a vehicle that can be transcended by a new form of human \nlife. Many of the leading figures in modem thought slip into some \nsuch mystique, some eschatology of immanence in which the in­\nsides of nature will erupt into a new being. Jung wrote such an \nargument in his Answer to Job; the answer to the laments of Job was \nthat mans condition would not always be the same because a new \nman would break out of the womb of creation. Erich Fromm once \nlamented33 that it is a wonder that more people are not insane, since \nlife is such a terrible burden; and then he went on to write a book \nwith the title: You Shall be as Gods. Gods verging on insanity, one \nmust assume.\nFortunately, there is no need for us to take up the metaphysical \naspects of this problem. It is now the center of a passionate and at \nthe same time coolly intellectual review by some of our best critical \nminds: not only by Rieff, but also by Lionel Trilling and now John \nPassmore in an important historical-critical work.34 It can all be \nsummed up in the simplest and sharpest terms: how can an ego- \ncontrolled animal change his structure; how can a self-conscious"

There is simply \nno way to transcend the limits of the human condition or to change \nthe psychological structural conditions that make humanity possible. \nWhat can it mean for something new to emerge from such an \nanimal and to triumph over his nature? Even though men have re­\npeated such a notion since the most ancient times and in the most \nsubtle and weightiest ways, even though whole movements of social \naction as well as thought have been inspired by such ideas, still \nthey are mere fancy—as Passmore has so well reminded us. I myself \nhave been fond of using ideas like the developing “spirit” of man \nand the promise of “new birth,” but I don’t think I ever meant them \nto conjure up a new creature; rather, I was thinking more of new \nbirth bringing new adaptations, new creative solutions to our prob­\nlems, a new openness in dealing with stale perceptions about reality, \nnew forms of art, music, literature, architecture that would be a \ncontinual transformation of reality—but behind it all would be the \nsame type of evolutionary creature, making his own peculiar re­\nsponses to a world that continued to transcend him.0\nIf psychotherapists and scientists lapse into metaphysics so easily, \nwe should not blame theologians for doing the same. But ironically, \ntheologians today are often the most sober about immanence and \nits possibilities. Consider Paul Tillich: he too had his metaphysic \nof New Being, the belief in the emergence of a new type of person \nwho would be more in harmony with nature, less driven, more \n^perceptive, more in touch with his own creative energies, and who \nmight go on to form genuine communities to replace the col- \nr lectivities of our time, communities of truer persons in place of the \n( objective creatures created by our materialistic culture. But Tillich \nna3 fewer illusions about this New Being than most of the psycho­\ntherapeutic religionists. He saw that the idea was actually a myth, \nan ideal that might be worked toward and so partly realized. It was \nnot a fixed truth about the insides of nature. This point is crucial. \nAs he so honestly put it: “The only argument for the truth of this\n* Philip Rieff sobered me up about my loose use of ideas of immanence\n(\nduring a panel exchange a couple of years ago. In a characteristically honest and dramatic way he admitted that he was—like everyone else—a “part man,” and he enjoined the audience to admit that we all were, asking what it could possibly mean to be a “whole man.”\n\f\n278 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nGospel of New Being is that the message makes itself true.”35 Or, \nas we would say in the science of man, it is an ideal-typical en- \njoinder.36\nI think the whole question of what is possible for the inner life \nof man was nicely summed up by Suzanne Langer in the phrase \n“the myth of the inner life.”37 She used this term in reference to the \nexperience of music, but it seems to apply to the whole metaphysic \nof the unconscious, of the emergence of new energies from the \nheart of nature. But let us quickly add that this use of the term \n“myth” is not meant to be disparaging or to reflect simple “illusion.” \nAs Langer explained, some myths are vegetative, they generate real \nconceptual power, real apprehension of a dim truth, some kind of \nglobal adumbration of what we miss by sharp, analytic reason. \nMost of all, as William James and Tillich have argued, beliefs about \nreality affect people’s real actions: they help introduce the new into \nthe world. Especially is this true for beliefs about man, about hu­\nman nature, and about what man may yet become. If something \ninfluences our efforts to change the world, then to some extent it \nmust change that world. This helps explain one of the things that \nperplex us about psychoanalytic prophets like Erich Fromm; we \nwonder how they can so easily forget about the dilemmas of the \nhuman condition that tragically limit mans efforts. The answer is, \non one level, that they have to leave tragedy behind as part of a \nprogram to awaken some kind of hopeful creative effort by men. \nFromm has nicely argued the Deweyan thesis that, as reality is \npartly the result of human effort, the person who prides himself on \nbeing a “hard-headed realist” and refrains from hopeful action is \nreally abdicating the human task.38 This accent on human effort, \nvisionTancT hope in order to help shape reality seems to me largely \nto exonerate Fromm from the charges that he really is a “rabbi at \nheart” who is impelled to redeem man and cannot let the world be. \nIf the alternative is fatalistic acceptance of the present human con­\ndition, then each of us is a rabbi—or had better be.\nBut once we say this, once we make a pragmatic argument for \ncreative myth, it does not let us off the hook so easily about the \nnature of the real world. It only makes us more uncomfortable with \nthe therapeutic religionists. If you are going to have a myth of New \nBeing, then, like Tillich, you have to use this myth as a call to the\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?279\nhighest and most difficult effort—and not to simple joy. A creative \nmyth is not simply a relapse into comfortable illusion; it has to be \nas bold as possible in order to be truly generative.\nWhat singles out Tillich’s cogitations about the New Being is that \nthere is no nonsense here. Tillich means that man has to have the \n“courage to be” himself, to stand on his own feet, to face up to the \neternal contradictions of the real world. The bold goal of this kind «  \nof courage is to absorb into ones own being the maximum amount \nof nonbeing. As a being, as an extension of all of Being, man has an \norganismic impulsion: to take into his own organization the maxi­\nmum amount of the problematic of life. His daily life, then, be­\ncomes truly a duty of cosmic proportions, and his courage to face \nthe anxiety of meaninglessness becomes a true cosmic heroism. No j \nlonger does one do as God wills, set over against some imaginary \nfigure in heaven. Rather, in one’s own person he tries to achieve \nwhat the creative powers of emergent Being have themselves so far \nachieved with lower forms of life: the overcoming of that which \nwould negate life. The problem of meaninglessness is the form in \nwhich nonbeing poses itself in our time; then, says Tillich, the task \nof conscious beings at the height of their evolutionary destiny is to \nmeet and vanquish this new emergent obstacle to sentient life. In \nthis kind of ontology of immanence of the New Being, what we are \ndescribing is not a creature who is transformed and who transforms \nthe world in turn in some miraculous ways, but rather a creature \nwho takes more of the world into himself and develops new forms \nof courage and endurance. It is not very different from the Athenian \nideal as expressed in Oedipus or from what it meant to Kant to be a \nman. At least, this is the ideal for a new kind of man; it shows why \nTillich’s myth of being “truly centered” on one’s own energies is a \nradical one. It points to all the evasions of centeredness in man: \nalways being part of something or someone else, sheltering oneself \nin alien powers. Transference, even after we admit its necessary and \nideal dimensions, reflects some universal betrayal of man’s own \npowers, which is why he is always submerged by the large struc­\ntures of society. He mntrihnte?Lla-tha_very things that enslave him. \nThe critique of guru therapies also comes to rest here: you can’t \ntalk about an ideal of freedom in the same breath that you willingly \ngive it up. This fact turned Koestler against the East,39 just as it\n\f\n28o THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nalso led Tillich to argue so penetratingly that Eastern mysticism is \nnot for Western man. It is an evasion of the courage to be; it pre­\nvents the absorption of maximum meaninglessness into oneself.40! \nTillich s point is that mystical experience seems to be near to per­\nfect faith but is not. Mysticism lacks precisely the element of \nskepticism, and skepticism is a more radical experience, a more \nmanly confrontation of potential meaninglessness. Even more, we \nmust not forget that much of the time, mysticism as popularly \npractised is fused with a sense of magical omnipotence: it is actually \na manic defense and a denial of creatureliness.41\nAgain, we are talking about the highest ideal things, which al­\nways seem most unreal—but how can we settle for less? We need \nthe boldest creative myths, not only to urge men on but also and \nperhaps especially to help men see the reality of their condition. We \nhave to be as hard-headed as possible about reality and possibility. \nFrom this point of view we can see that the therapeutic revolution \nraises two great problems. The first is how mature, critical, and \nsober these new liberated people will be. HoaL-piuch have they \npushed in the direction of genuine freedom; liow much have they \navoidecTtHereal woftd\"'and its problems, their own bitter paradoxes; \nhow much have they Tiedged on their liberation by still holding on \nto others, to illusions, or to certainties? If the Freudian revolution \nin~mo3ern thought can mean anything at all, it must be that it \nbrings to birth a new level of introspection as well as social \ncriticism. We already see these reflected not only in academic in­\ntellectual awareness but also even in the popular mind, in the letters \nand advice columns of mass-circulation newspapers. Where, 35 \nyears ago, could you read an advice to the lovelorn that cautioned a \ngirl against her boy friend who refused for moral reasons to make love\nf I think Tillich failed to see through one idol in his search for the courage to be. He seems to have liked the idea of the collective unconscious because it expressed the dimension of the inner depth of being and might be an access to the realm of essence. This seems to me a surprising lapse from his customary soberness. How could the ground of being be as accessible as Jung imagined? It seems to me that this concept would destroy the whole idea of The Fall. How can man have the realm of essence “on tap,” so to speak; and if he does, doesn’t Tillich’s understanding of grace lose all its meaning as a pure gift beyond human effort?\n\f\nto her as she asked him to, because he might be “projecting” onto \nher his own impotence?\nBut this brings up the second great problem raised by the thera­\npeutic revolution, namely, So What? Even with numerous groups of \nreally liberated people, at their best, we cant imagine that the \nworld will be any pleasanter or less tragic a place. It may even be \nworse in still unknown ways. As Tillich warned us, New Being, \nunder the conditions and limitations of existence, will only bring \ninto play new and sharper paradoxes, new tensions, and more pain­\nful disharmonies—a “more intense demonism.” Reality is remorse­\nless because gods do not walk upon the earth; and if men could \nbecome noble repositories of great gulfs of nonbeing, they would \nhave even less peace than we oblivious and driven madmen have \ntoday. Besides, can any ideal of therapeutic revolution touch the \nvast masses of this globe, the modern mechanical men in Russia, \nthe near-billion sheeplike followers in China, the brutalized and \nignorant populations of almost every continent? When one lives in \nthe liberation atmosphere of Berkeley, California, or in the intoxica­\ntions of small doses of unconstriction in a therapeutic group in ones \nhome town, one is living in a hothouse atmosphere that shuts out \nthe reality of the rest of the planet, the way things really are in \nthis world. It is this therapeutic megalomania that must quickly \nbeen seen through if we are not to be perfect fools. The empirical \nfacts of the world will not fade away because one has analyzed his \nOedipus complex, as Freud so well knew, or because one can make \nlove with tenderness, as so many now believe. Forget it. In this \nsense again it is Freuds somber pessimism, especially of his later \nwritings such as Civilization and Its Discontents, that keeps him so \ncontemporary. Men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic \nand demonic world.\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual? 281\nThe Fusion of Science and Religion\nTherapeutic religion will never replace traditional religions with \nthe messages of Judaism, most of Christianity, Buddhism, and the \nlike. They have held that man is doomed to his present form, that\n\f\n282 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nhe cant really evolve any further, that anything he might achieve \ncan only be achieved from within the real nightmare of his loneli­\nness in creation and from the energies that he now has. He has to \nadapt and wait. New birth will keep him going, give him constant \nrenewal, say the Christians; and if he has perfect righteousness and \nfaith, and enough of it spread widely enough among his fellows, \nthen, say the Hebrews, God Himself will act. Men should wait \nwhile using their best intelligence and effort to secure their adapta­\ntion and survival. Ideally they would wait in a condition of openness \ntoward miracle and mystery, in the lived truth of creation, which \nwould make it easier both to survive and to be redeemed because \nmen would be less driven to undo themselves and would be more \nlike the image that pleases their Creator: awe-filled creatures trying \nto live in harmony with the rest of creation. Today we would add, \ntoo, that they would be less likely to poison the rest of creation.42\nWhat do we mean by the lived truth of creation? We have to mean \nthe world as it appears to men in a condition of relative unrepres­\nsion; that is, as it would appear to creatures who assessed their true \npuniness in the face of the overwhelmingness and majesty of the \nuniverse, of the unspeakable miracle of even the single created \nobject; as it probably appeared to the earliest men on the planet \nand to those extrasensitive types who have filled the roles of shaman, \nprophet, saint, poet, and artist. What is unique about their percep­\ntion of reality is that it is alive to the panic inherent in creation: \nSylvia Plath somewhere named God “King Panic.” And Panic is \nfittingly King of the Grotesque. What are we to make of a creation \nin which the routine activity is for organisms to be tearing others \napart with teeth of all types—biting, grinding flesh, plant stalks, \nbones between molars, pushing the pulp greedily down the gullet \nwith delight, incorporating its essence into one's own organization, \nand then excreting with foul stench and gasses the residue. Every­\none reaching out to incorporate others who are edible to him. The \nmosquitoes bloating themselves on blood, the maggots, the killer- \nbees attacking with a fury and a demonism, sharks continuing to \ntear and swallow while their own innards are being torn out—not \nto mention the daily dismemberment and slaughter in “natural” \naccidents of all types: an earthquake buries alive 70 thousand \nbodies in Peru, automobiles make a pyramid heap of over 50 thou­\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?283\nsand a year in the U.S. alone, a tidal wave washes over a quarter \nof a million in the Indian Ocean. Creation is a nightmare spectacular \ntaking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of \nmillions of years in the blood of all its creatures. The soberest con­\nclusion that we could make about what has actually been taking \nplace on the planet for about three billion years is that it is being \nturned into a vast pit of fertilizer. But the sun distracts our atten­\ntion, always baking the blood dry, making things grow over it, and \nwith its warmth giving the hope that comes with the organism’s \ncomfort and expansiveness. “Questo sol m’arde, e questo minna- \nmore,” as Michelangelo put it.\nScience and religion merge in a critique of the deadening of per­\nception of this kind of truth, and science betrays us when it is \nwilling to absorb lived truth all into itself. Here the criticism of all \nbehaviorist psychology, all manipulations of men, and all coercive \nutopianism comes to rest. These techniques try to make the world \nother than it is, legislate the grotesque out of it, inaugurate a \n“proper” human condition. The psychologist Kenneth Clark, in his \nrecent presidential address to the American Psychological Associa­\ntion, called for a new kind of chemical to deaden man’s aggressive­\nness and so make the world a less dangerous place. The Watsons, \nthe Skinners, the Pavlovians—all have their formulas for smoothing \nthings out. Even Freud—Enlightenment man that he was, after all \n—wanted to see a saner world and seemed willing to absorb lived \ntruth into science if only it were possible. He once mused that in \norder to really change things by therapy one would have to get at \nthe masses of men; and that the only way to do this would be to \nmix the copper of suggestion into the pure gold of psychoanalysis. \nIn other words, to coerce, by transference, a less evil world. But \nFreud knew better, as he gradually came to see that the evil in the \nworld is not only in the insides of people but on the outside, in \nnature—which is why he became more realistic and pessimistic in \nhis later work.\nThe problem with all the scientific manipulators is that somehow \nthey don’t take life seriously enough; in this sense, all science is \n'bourgeois,” an affair of bureaucrats. I think that taking life ser­\niously means something such as this: that whatever man does on \nthis planet has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation,\n\f\n284 THE DENIAL OF DEATH\nI of the grotesque, of the rumble of panic underneath everything.\n* Otherwise it is false. Whatever is achieved must be achieved from \nwithin the subjective energies of creatures, without deadening, with \nthe full exercise of passion, of vision, of pain, of fear, and of sorrow. \nHow do we know—with Rilke—that our part of the meaning of the \nI universe might not be a rhythm in sorrow? Manipulative, utopian \nI science, by deadening human sensitivity, would also deprive men \nlrfthe heroic in their urge to victory. And we know that in some \nvery important way tins falsifies our stmgg^ \npreventing us from incorporating the maximum of experience. It \nmeans the end of the distinctively human—or even, we must say, \n? the distinctively organismic.\nIn the mysterious way in which life is given to us in evolution \non this planet, it pushes in ihajjimction of its own expansion. We \ndon’t understand it simply because we don’t know the purpose of \ncreation^ we only feel life straining in ourselves and see it.thrashing \nothers about as they devour each other. Life seeks to expand in an \nunknown direction for unknown reasons. Not even psychology \nshould meddle with this sacrosanct vitality, concluded Rank. This \nf is the meaning of his option for the “irrational” as the basis for\nI life; it is an option based on empirical experience. There is a driv- \n> ing force behind a mystery that we cannot understand, and it in­\ncludes more than reason alone. The urge to cosmic heroism, then, \n| is sacred and mysterious and not to be neatly ordered and ra­\ntionalized by science and secularism. Science, after all, is a credo \n| that has attempted to absorb into itself and to deny the fear of life \nand death; and it is only one more competitor in the spectrum of \nroles for cosmic heroics.\nModern man is drinking and drugging himself out of awareness, \nor he spends his time shopping, which is the same thing. As aware- \nness calls for types of heroic dedication that his culture no longer \nprovides forhim, society contrives^ to help Kim forget. Or^alterna- \n\"tively, he buries Himself in psvchologv in the belief that awareness \nall by itself will be some kind of magical cure for his problems. But \n^psycholo^y was bom wTth the breakdown of shared social heroisms; \nitcanonly be gone beyond with the Creation oTnew heroisnTsthat \nareljasicaffiT^ a vision. Lifton\nhas recently concluded the same thing, from a conceptual point of\n\f\nWhat Is the Heroic Individual?285\nview almost identical to Ranks.43 When a thinker of Norman \nBrowns stature wrote his later book Love's Body, he was led to take \nhis thought to this same point, ffe realized that the only way to get \nbeyond jhe,jiatural._j2Qntradictions of existence__was_in“the~~tmre»- \nworn religious way: to project one’s problems onto a goMgure^ii \nBe Healed By an all-embracing and all-justifying beyond. To talk in \nffieseTermsls not at allTKeTameThing as to talk the language of \nthe psychotherapeutic religionists. Rank was not so naive nor so \nmessianic: he saw that the orientation of men has to be always \nbeyond their bodies, has to be grounded in healthy repressions, and \ntoward explicit immortality-ideologies, myths of heroic trans­\ncendence. f\nWe can conclude that a project as grand as the scientific-mythical \nconstruction of victory over human limitation is not something that \ncan be programmed by science. Even more, it comes from the vital \nenergies of masses of men sweating within the nightmare of crea­\ntion—and it is not even in mans hands to program. Who knows \nwhat form the forward momentum of life will take in the time \nahead or what use it will make of our anguished searching. The \nmost that any one of us can seem to do is to fashion something— \nan object or ourselves—and drop it into the confusion, make an \noffering of it, so to speak, to the life force.\n| It is worth noting that Brown’s final point of arrival is the logically correct one, but I personally find his later book very unsatisfying. One wonders why he has to present his new position in such a barrage of aphorisms, such a turbulent hodgepodge of half-veiled thoughts, terse in the extreme, and often cryptic—only to end up in a mystical Christianity of the oldest vintage and a call for the final judgment day. In this, at least, his later book is entirely consistent with the earlier one: natural existence in the frustrating limitations of the body calls for total, all-or-nothing relief, either in unrepression or at last in the end of the world."
