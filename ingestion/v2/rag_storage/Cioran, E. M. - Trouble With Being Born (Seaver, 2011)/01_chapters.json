And why all this? Because I was\nborn. It is a special type of sleeplessness that produces the indictment of\nbirth.\n“Ever since I was born”—that since has a resonance so dreadful to my ears\nit becomes unendurable.\nThere is a kind of knowledge that strips whatever you do of weight and\nscope: for such knowledge, everything is without basis except itself. Pure to\nthe point of abhorring even the notion of an object, it translates that extreme\nscience according to which doing or not doing something comes down to\nthe same thing and is accompanied by an equally extreme satisfaction: that\nof being able to rehearse, each time, the discovery that any gesture\nperformed is not worth defending, that nothing is enhanced by the merest\nvestige of substance, that “reality” falls within the province of lunacy. Such\nknowledge deserves to be called posthumous: it functions as if the knower\nwere alive and not alive, a being and the memory of a being. “It’s already in\nthe past,” he says about all he achieves, even as he achieves it, thereby\nforever destitute of the present\n\f\nUnmaking, decreating, is the only task man may take upon himself, if he\naspires, as everything suggests, to distinguish himself from the Creator.\nI know that my birth is fortuitous, a laughable accident, and yet, as soon as I\nforget myself, I behave as if it were a capital event, indispensable to the\nprogress and equilibrium of the world.\nTo have committed every crime but that of being a father.\nAs a general rule, men expect disappointment: they know they must not be\nimpatient, that it will come sooner or later, that it will hold off long enough\nfor them to proceed with their undertakings of the moment. The disabused\nman is different: for him, disappointment occurs at the same time as the\ndeed; he has no need to await it, it is present. By freeing himself from\nsuccession, he has devoured the possible and rendered the future\nsuperfluous. “I cannot meet you in your future,” he says to the others. “We\ndo not have a single moment in common.” Because for him the whole of the\nfuture is already here.\nWhen we perceive the end in the beginning, we move faster than time.\nIllumination, that lightning disappointment, affords a certitude which\ntransforms disillusion into deliverance.\nI disentangle myself from appearances, yet I am snarled in them\nnonetheless; or rather: I am halfway between these appearances and that\nwhich invalidates them, that which has neither name nor content, that\nwhich is nothing and everything. I shall never take the decisive step outside\nthem; my nature forces me to drift, to remain forever in the equivocal, and\nif I were to attempt a clean break in one direction or the other, I should\nperish by my salvation.\n\f\nMy faculty for disappointment surpasses understanding. It is what lets me\ncomprehend Buddha, but also what keeps me from following him.\nWhat we can no longer commiserate with counts for nothing—no longer\nexists. We realize why our past so quickly stops being “ours” and turns into\nhistory, something which no longer concerns anyone.\nIn the deepest part of yourself, aspire to be as dispossessed, as lamentable\nas God.\nTrue contact between beings is established only by mute presence, by\napparent non-communication, by that mysterious and wordless exchange\nwhich resembles inward prayer.\nWhat I know at sixty, I knew as well at twenty. Forty years of a long, a\nsuperfluous, labor of verification.\nI am for the most part so convinced that everything is lacking in basis,\nconsequence, justification, that if someone dared to contradict me, even the\nman I most admire, he would seem to me a charlatan or a fool\nEven in childhood I watched the hours flow, independent of any reference,\nany action, any event, the disjunction of time from what was not itself, its\nautonomous existence, its special status, its empire, its tyranny. I remember\n\f\nquite clearly that afternoon when, for the first time, confronting the empty\nuniverse, I was no more than a passage of moments reluctant to go on\nplaying their proper parts. Time was coming unstuck from being—at my\nexpense.\nUnlike Job, I have not cursed the day I was born; all the other days, on the\ncontrary, I have covered with my anathemas….\nIf death had only negative aspects, dying would be an unmanageable action.\nEverything exists; nothing exists. Either formula affords a like serenity. The\nman of anxiety, to his misfortune, remains between them, trembling and\nperplexed, forever at the mercy of a nuance, incapable of gaining a foothold\nin the security of being or in the absence of being.\nHere on the coast of Normandy, at this hour of the morning, I needed no\none. The very gulls’ presence bothered me: I drove them off with stones.\nAnd hearing their supernatural shrieks, I realized that that was just what I\nwanted, that only the Sinister could soothe me, and that it was for such a\nconfrontation that I had got up before dawn.\n“In this our life”—to be in life: suddenly I am struck by the strangeness of\nsuch an expression, as if it applied to no one.\nWhenever I flag and feel sorry for my brain, I am carried away by an\nirresistible desire to proclaim. That is the moment I realize the paltry depths\n\f\nout of which rise reformers, prophets, and saviors.\nI long to be free—desperately free. Free as the stillborn are free.\nIf there is so much discomfort and ambiguity in lucidity, it is because\nlucidity is the result of the poor use to which we have put our sleepless\nnights.\nOur obsession with birth, by shifting us to a point before our past, robs us of\nour pleasure in the future, in the present, and even in the past.\nRare are the days when, projected into post-history, I fail to witness the\ngods’ hilarity at leaving behind the human episode.\nWhat we need is an alternate vision, when that of the Last Judgment no\nlonger satisfies anyone.\nAn idea, a being, anything which becomes incarnate loses identity, turns\ngrotesque. Frustration of all achievement. Never quit the possible, wallow\nin eternal trifling, forget to be born.\nThe real, the unique misfortune: to see the light of day. A disaster which\ndates back to aggressiveness, to the seed of expansion and rage within\norigins, to the tendency to the worst which first shook them up.\n\f\nWhen we see someone again after many years, we should sit down facing\neach other and say nothing for hours, so that by means of silence our\nconsternation can relish itself.\nDays of miraculous sterility. Instead of rejoicing over them, proclaiming\nvictory, transforming this drought into a celebration, seeing it as an\nillustration of my fulfillment, my maturity, in short my detachment, I let\nmyself be invaded by spite and resentment: so tenacious is the old Adam in\nus, the bustling canaille, unfit for self-effacement.\nI am enraptured by Hindu philosophy, whose essential endeavor is to\nsurmount the self; and everything I do, everything I think is only myself\nand the selfs humiliations.\nWhile we are performing an action, we have a goal; performed, the action\nhas no more reality for us than the goal we were seeking. Nothing of much\nconsequence here—no more than a game. But some of us are conscious of\nthis game in the course of the action: we experience the conclusion in the\npremises, the achieved in the virtual—we undermine “seriousness” by the\nvery fact that we exist.\nThe vision of non-reality, of universal default, is the product of an\neveryday sensation and a sudden frisson. Everything is a game—without\nsuch a revelation, the sensation we haul through our usual lives would not\nhave that characteristic stamp our metaphysical experiences require to be\ndistinguished from their imitations, our discomforts. For every discomfort is\nonly an abortive metaphysical experience."

    "raw_text": "When we have worn out the interest we once took in death, when we realize\nwe have nothing more to gain from it, we fall back on birth, we turn to a\nmuch more inexhaustible abyss.\nAt this very moment, I am suffering—as we say in French, j’ai mal. This\nevent, crucial for me, is nonexistent, even inconceivable for anyone else, for\neveryone else. Except for God, if that word can have a meaning.\nwould grow, develop, gather force. Hence we see why, by taking, a contrary\ntrajectory, they lack spirit and are so weary, when at last they come up\nagainst their initial frontier, that they no longer have the energy to look\nbeyond, toward the “never-born.”\nIt is not my beginnings, it is the beginning that matters to me. If I bump into\nmy birth, into a minor obsession, it is because I cannot grapple with the first\nmoment of time. Every individual discomfort leads back, ultimately, to a\ncosmogonie discomfort, each of our sensations expiating that crime of the\nprimordial sensation, by which Being crept out of somewhere….\nThough we may prefer ourselves to the universe, we nonetheless loathe\nourselves much more than we suspect. If the wise man is so rare a\nphenomenon, it is because he seems unshaken by the aversion which, like\nall beings, he must feel for himself.\n\f\nNo difference between being and non-being, if we apprehend them with the\nsame intensity.\nNescience is the basis of everything, it creates everything by an action\nrepeated every moment, it produces this and any world, since it continually\ntakes for real what in fact is not. Nescience is the tremendous mistake that\nserves as the basis of all our truths, it is older and more powerful than all\nthe gods combined.\nThis is how we recognize the man who has tendencies toward an inner\nquest: he will set failure above any success, he will even seek it out,\nunconsciously of course. This is because failure, always essential, reveals\nus to ourselves, permits us to see ourselves as God sees us, whereas success\ndistances us from what is most inward in ourselves and indeed in\neverything.\nThere was a time when time did not yet exist…. The rejection of birth is\nnothing but the nostalgia for this time before time.\nI think of so many friends who are no more, and I pity them. Yet they are\nnot so much to be pitied, for they have solved every problem, beginning\nwith the problem of death.\nIn the fact of being born there is such an absence of necessity that when you\nthink about it a little more than usual, you are left—ignorant how to react—\nwith a foolish grin."

    "raw_text": "Two kinds of mind: daylight and nocturnal. They have neither the same\nmethod nor the same morality. In broad daylight, you watch yourself; in the\ndark, you speak out. The salutary or awkward consequences of what he\nthinks matter little to the man who questions himself at hours when others\nare the prey of sleep. Hence he meditates upon the bad luck of being born\nwithout concern for the harm he can cause others or himself. After midnight\nbegins the intoxication of pernicious truths.\nAs the years accumulate, we form an increasingly somber image of the\nfuture. Is this only to console ourselves for being excluded from it? Yes in\nappearance, no in fact, for the future has always been hideous, man being\nable to remedy his evils only by aggravating them, so that in each epoch\nexistence is much more tolerable before the solution is found to the\ndifficulties of the moment.\nIn major perplexities, try to live as if history were done with and to react\nlike a monster riddled by serenity.\nIf I used to ask myself, over a coffin: “What good did it do the occupant to\nbe born?,” I now put the same question about anyone alive.\nThe emphasis on birth is no more than the craving for the insoluble carried\nto the point of insanity.\n\f\nRegarding death, I ceaselessly waver between “mystery” and\n“inconsequentiality”—between the Pyramids and the Morgue.\nIt is impossible to feel that there was a time when we did not exist. Hence\nour attachment to the personage we were before being born.\n“Meditate but one hour upon the selfs nonexistence and you will feel\nyourself to be another man.” said a priest of the Japanese Kusha sea to a\nWestern visitor.\nWithout having frequented the Buddhist monasteries, how many times\nhave I not lingered over- the world’s unreality, and hence my own? I have\nnot become another man for that, no, but there certainly has remained with\nme the feeling that my identity is entirely illusory, and that by losing it I\nhave lost nothing, except something, except everything.\nInstead of clinging to the fact of being born, as good sense bids, I take the\nrisk, I turn back, I retrogress increasingly toward some unknown beginning,\nI move from origin to origin. Some day, perhaps, I shall manage to reach\norigin itself, in order to rest there, or be wrecked.\nX insults me. I am about to hit him. Thinking it over, I refrain.\nWho am I? which is my real self: the self of the retort or that of the\nrefraining? My first reaction is always energetic; the second one, flabby.\nWhat is known as “wisdom” is ultimately only a perpetual “thinking it\nover,” i.e., non-action as first impulse.\n\f\nIf attachment is an evil, we must look for its cause in the scandal of birth,\nfor to be born is to be attached. Detachment then should apply itself to\ngetting rid of the traces of this scandal, the most serious and intolerable of\nall.\nAmid anxiety and distress, sudden calm at the thought of the foetus one has\nbeen.\nAt this precise moment, no reproach proceeding from men or gods can\naffect me: I have as good a conscience as if I had never existed.\nIt is a mistake to believe in a direct relation between suffering reverses and\nbeing dead set against birth. Such opposition has deeper, more distant roots,\nand would occur even if one had only the shadow of a grievance against\nexistence. In fact it is never more virulent than in cases of extreme good\nfortune.\nThracians and Bogomils—I cannot forget that I have haunted the same\nwhereabouts as they, nor that the former wept over the newborn and the\nlatter, in order to justify God, held Satan responsible for the infamy of\nCreation.\nDuring the long nights in the caves, how many Hamlets must have\nmurmured their endless monologues—for it is likely that the apogee of\nmetaphysical torment is to be located well before that universal insipidity\nwhich followed the advent of Philosophy."

    "raw_text": "The obsession with birth proceeds from an exacerbation of memory, from\nan omnipresence of the past, as well as from a craving for the impasse, for\nthe first impasse. —No openness, hence no joy from the past but solely\nfrom the present, and from a future emancipated from time.\nFor years, in fact for life, to have meditated only on your last moments,\nonly to discover, when at last you approach them, that it was of no use, that\nthe thought of death helps in everything save in dying!\nIt is our discomforts which provoke, which create consciousness; their task\naccomplished, they weaken and disappear one after the other.\nConsciousness however remains and survives them, without recalling what\nit owes to them, without even ever having known. Hence it continually\nproclaims its autonomy, its sovereignty, even when it loathes itself and\nwould do away with itself.\nAccording to the Rule of Saint Benedict, if a monk became proud of or\nmerely satisfied with the task he was performing, he was to forsake it then\nand there.\nOne danger not dreaded by the man who has lived in the thirst for\nunsatisfaction, in an orgy of remorse and disgust.\nIf it is true that God dislikes taking sides, I should feel no awkwardness in\nHis presence, so pleased would I be to imitate Him, to be like Him, in\neverything, “without opinion.”"

    "raw_text": "To get up in the morning, wash and then wait for some unforeseen variety\nof dread or depression.\nI would give the whole universe and all of Shakespeare for a grain of\nataraxy.\nNietzsche’s great luck—to have ended as he did: in euphoria!\nEndlessly to refer to a world where nothing yet stooped to occurrence,\nwhere you anticipated consciousness without desiring it, where, wallowing\nin the virtual, you rejoiced in the null plenitude of a self anterior to\nselfhood….\nNot to have been born, merely musing on that—what happiness, what\nfreedom, what space!\n\f\n2\nIf disgust for the world conferred sanctity of itself, I fail to see how I could\navoid canonization.\nNo one has lived so close to his skeleton as I have lived to mine: from\nwhich results an endless dialogue and certain truths which I manage neither\nto accept nor to reject.\nIt is easier to get on with vices than with virtues. The vices, accommodating\nby nature, help each other, are full of mutual indulgence, whereas the\njealous virtues combat and annihilate each other, showing in everything\ntheir incompatibility and their intolerance.\nIt is trifling to believe in what you do or in what others do. You should\navoid simulacra and even “realities;” you should take up a position external\nto everything and everyone, drive off or grind down your appetites, live,\naccording to a Hindu adage, with as few desires as a “solitary elephant.”\n\f\nI forgive X everything because of his obsolete smile.\nNot one moment when I have not been conscious of being outside Paradise.\nOnly what you hide is profound, is true. Whence the power of base feelings.\nAma nesari, says the Imitation of Christ. Love to be unknown. We are\nhappy with ourselves and with the world only when we conform to this\nprecept.\nThe intrinsic value of a book does not depend on the importance of its\nsubject (else the theologians would prevail, and mightily), but on the\nmanner of approaching the accidental and the insignificant, of mastering the\ninfinitesimal. The essential has never required the least talent.\nThe feeling of being ten thousand years behind, or ahead, of the others, of\nbelonging to the beginnings or to the end of humanity …\nNegation never proceeds from reasoning but from something much more\nobscure and old. Arguments come afterward, to justify and sustain it. Every\nno rises out of the blood.\nWith the help of the erosion of memory, to recall the first initiatives of\nmatter and the risk of life which followed from them …\n\f\nEach time I fail to think about death, I have the impression of cheating, of\ndeceiving someone in me.\nThere are nights that the most ingenious torturers could not have invented.\nWe emerge from them in pieces, stupid, dazed, with neither memories nor\nanticipations, and without even knowing who we are. And it is then that the\nday seems useless, light pernicious, even more oppressive than the\ndarkness.\nA conscious fruit fly would have to confront exactly the same difficulties,\nthe same kind of insoluble problems as man.\nBetter to be an animal than a man, an insect than an animal, a plant than an\ninsect, and so on.\nSalvation? Whatever diminishes the kingdom of consciousness and\ncompromises its supremacy.\nI have all the defects of other people and yet everything they do seems to\nme inconceivable.\nConsidering things according to nature, man was made to live facing\noutward. If he would see into himself, he must close his eyes, renounce his\nendeavors, quit the immediate. What is called “inner life” is a belated\nphenomenon, possible only by a slowing down of our vital activities, “the\n\f\nsoul” being able to emerge and elaborate itself only at the expense of the\ngood behavior of our organs.\nThe merest atmospheric variation jeopardizes my plans, not to speak of my\nconvictions. This kind of dependency—the most humiliating kind—\nunfailingly lays me low, even as it dissipates what few illusions remain as\nto my possibilities of being free and as to freedom itself. What is the use of\nswaggering if you are at the mercy of Wet and Dry? One craves a less\nlamentable bondage, and gods of another kidney.\nIt’s not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself\ntoo late.\nWhen you know quite absolutely that everything is unreal, you then cannot\nsee why you should take the trouble to prove it.\nAs it leaves dawn behind and advances into the day, light prostitutes itself\nand is redeemed—ethics of twilight—only at the moment it vanishes.\nIn Buddhist writings, mention is often made of “the abyss of birth.” An\nabyss indeed, a gulf into which we do not fall but from which, instead, we\nemerge, to our universal chagrin.\nAt increasingly wider intervals, impulses of gratitude toward Job and\nChamfort—toward vociferation and vitriol …\n\f\nEach opinion, each view is necessarily partial, truncated, inadequate. In\nphilosophy and in anything, originality comes down to incomplete\ndefinitions.\nIf we consider closely our so-called generous actions, there is none which,\nfrom some aspect, is not blameworthy and even harmful, so that we come to\nregret having performed it—so that we must choose, finally, between\nabstention and remorse.\nExplosive force of any mortification. Every vanquished desire affords us\npower. We have the more hold over this world the further we withdraw\nfrom it, the less we adhere to it. Renunciation confers an infinite power.\nMy disappointments, instead of converging toward a center and constituting\nif not a system at least an ensemble, are scattered, each supposing itself\nunique and thereby wasted, lacking organization.\nThe only successful philosophies and religions are the ones that flatter us,\nwhether in the name of progress or of hell Damned or not, man experiences\nan absolute need to be at the heart of everything. It is, in fact, solely for this\nreason that he is man, that he has become man. And if some day he no\nlonger feels this need, he must give way to some other animal prouder,\nmadder than himself.\n\f\nHe detested objective truths, the burden of argument, sustained reasoning.\nHe disliked demonstrating, he wanted to convince no one. Others are a\ndialectician’s invention.\nThe more injured you are by time, the more you seek to escape it. To write a\nfaultless page, or only a sentence, raises you above becoming and its\ncorruptions. You transcend death by the pursuit of the indestructible in\nspeech, in the very symbol of nullity.\nAt the climax of a failure, at the moment when shame is about to do us in,\nsuddenly we are swept away by a frenzy of pride which lasts only long\nenough to drain us, to leave us without energy, to lower, with our powers,\nthe intensity of our shame.\nIf death is as horrible as is claimed, how is it that after the passage of a\ncertain period of time we consider happy any being, friend or enemy, who\nhas ceased to live?\nMore than once, I have managed to leave my room, for if I had stayed there\nI could not be sure of being able to resist some sudden resolution. The street\nis more reassuring, you think less about yourself there, there everything\nweakens and wilts, beginning with your own confusion.\nCharacteristic of sickness to stay awake when everything sleeps, when\neverything is at rest, even the sick man.\n\f\nWhen we are young, we take a certain pleasure in our infirmities. They\nseem so new, so rich! With age, they no longer surprise us, we know them\ntoo well. Now, without anything unexpected in them, they do not deserve to\nbe endured.\nOnce we appeal to our most intimate selves, once we begin to labor and to\nproduce, we lay claim to gifts, we become unconscious of our own gaps.\nNo one is in a position to admit that what comes out of his own depths\nmight be worthless. “Self-knowledge”? A contradiction in terms.\nAll these poems where it is merely the Poem that is in question—a whole\npoetry with no other substance than itself! What would we say of a prayer\nwhose object was religion?\nThe mind that puts everything in question reaches, after a thousand\ninterrogations, an almost total inertia, a situation which the inert, in fact,\nknows from the start, by instinct. For what is inertia but a congenital\nperplexity?\nWhat a disappointment that Epicurus, the sage I most need, should have\nwritten over three hundred treatises! And what a relief that they are lost!\n“What do you do from morning to night?” “I endure myself.”\nA remark of my brother’s apropos of the troubles and pains our mother\nendured: “Old age is nature’s self-criticism.”\n\f\n“One must be mad or drunk,” the Abbe Sieyès said, to speak well in the\nknown languages. One must be drunk or mad, I should add, to dare, still, to\nuse words, any word….\nThe fanatic of elliptical gloom is sure to excel in any career save that of\nbeing a writer.\nHaving always lived in fear of being surprised by the worst, I have tried in\nevery circumstance to get a head start, flinging myself into misfortune long\nbefore it occurred.\nWe do not envy those who have the capacity to pray, whereas we are filled\nwith envy of the possessors of goods, of those who know wealth and fame.\nStrange that we resign ourselves to someone’s salvation and not to what\nfugitive advantages he may enjoy.\nI never met one Interesting mind that was not richly endowed with\ninadmissible deficiencies.\nNo true art without a strong dose of banality. The constant employment of\nthe unaccustomed readily wearies us, nothing being more unendurable than\nthe uniformity of the exceptional.\n\f\nThe trouble with using a borrowed language is that you have no right to\nmake too many mistakes in it. Now, it is by seeking a certain incorrectness\nwithout however abusing it, it is by continually approaching solecism, that\nwriting may be given the appearance of life.\nEach of us believes, quite unconsciously of course, that he alone pursues\nthe truth, which the rest are incapable of seeking out and unworthy of\nattaining. This madness is so deep-rooted and so useful that it is impossible\nto realize what would become of each of us if it were someday to disappear.\nThe first thinker was, without a doubt, the first man obsessed by why. An\nunaccustomed mania, not at all contagious: rare indeed are those who suffer\nfrom it, who are a prey to questioning, and who can accept no given\nbecause they were born in consternation.\nTo be objective is to treat others as you treat an object, a corpse—to behave\nwith them like an undertaker.\nThis very second has vanished forever, lost in the anonymous mass of the\nirrevocable. It will never return. I suffer from this, and I do not. Everything\nis unique—and insignificant.\nEmily Brontë: everything that comes from her has the capacity to\noverwhelm me. Haworth is my Mecca.\n\f\nTo walk along a stream, to pass, to flow with the water, without effort,\nwithout haste, while death continues in us its ruminations, its uninterrupted\nsoliloquy …\nOnly God has the privilege of abandoning us. Men can only drop us.\nWithout the faculty of forgetting, our past would weigh so heavily on our\npresent that we should not have the strength to confront another moment,\nstill less to live through it. Life would be bearable only to frivolous natures,\nthose in fact who do not remember.\nPlotinus, Porphyry tells us, had the gift of reading men’s souls. One day,\nwithout any warning, he told his astounded disciple not to try killing\nhimself but rather to take a journey. Porphyry left for Sicily: there he was\ncured of his melancholy but, he adds regretfully, he thereby missed being\npresent at his master’s death, which occurred during his absence.\nIt has been a long time since philosophers have read men’s souls. It is not\ntheir task, we are told. Perhaps. But we must not be surprised if they no\nlonger matter much to us.\nA work exists only if it is elaborated in the darkness with attention, with all\nthe care of the murderer plotting his crime. In both cases, what counts is the\nwill to strike.\nSelf-knowledge—the bitterest knowledge of all and also the kind we\ncultivate least: what is the use of catching ourselves out, morning to night,"

We\nmust live face to face with being, and not with the mind.\n“What are you waiting for in order to give up?” —Each sickness sends us a\nsummons disguised as a question. We play deaf, even as we realize that the\ngame is played out and that next time we must have the courage, at last, to\ncapitulate.\nThe older I grow, the less I react to frenzy, delirium. My taste, among\nthinkers, now goes only to extinct volcanoes.\nAs a young man, I bored myself to death, but I believed in myself. If I had\nno suspicion of the dreary creature I was to become, I knew nonetheless\n\f\nthat, whatever happened, Perplexity would not desert me, that it would keep\nwatch over my years with all the zeal and exactitude of Providence.\nIf we could see ourselves as others see us, we would vanish on the spot.\nI once remarked to an Italian friend that the Latin peoples are without\nsecrecy—too open, too garrulous—and that I preferred nations ravaged by\ntimidity, adding that a writer who has failed to know it in his life is\nworthless in his writings. “You’re right,” he answered. “When we describe\nour experiences in our books, there is a lack of intensity, and of extension,\nfor we have already told them a hundred times before.” Whereupon we\ntalked about the literature of femininity, of its absence of mystery in\ncountries where the salon and the confessional prevail.\nWe should never deprive ourselves, I forget who once remarked, of the\n“pleasures of piety.” Has religion ever been justified more delicately?\nThis craving to revise our enthusiasms, to change idols, to pray elsewhere\n…\nTo stretch out in a field, to smell the earth and tell yourself it is the end as\nwell as the hope of our dejections, that it would be futile to search for\nanything better to fest on, to dissolve into. …\nWhen I happen to be busy, I never give a moment’s thought to the\n“meaning” of anything, particularly of whatever it is I am doing. A proof\n\f\nthat the secret of everything is in action and not in abstention, that fatal\ncause of consciousness.\nWhat will be the physiognomy of painting, of poetry, of music, in a hundred\nyears? No one can tell. As after the fall of Athens, of Rome, a long pause\nwill intervene, caused by the exhaustion of the means of expression, as well\nas by the exhaustion of consciousness itself. Humanity, to rejoin the past,\nmust invent a second naïveté, without which the arts can never begin again.\nIn one of the chapels of this ideally ugly church, we find the Virgin standing\nwith her Son above the globe: an aggressive sect which has undermined and\nconquered an empire and inherited its flaws, beginning with gigantism.\nIt is written in the Zohar: “When man appeared, thereupon appeared the\nflowers.” I suspect they were there long before him, and that his advent\nplunged them all into a stupefaction from which they have not yet\nrecovered.\nImpossible to read a line by Kleist without thinking that he committed\nsuicide: as if his suicide had preceded his works.\nIn the Orient, the oddest, the most idiosyncratic Western thinkers would\nnever have been taken seriously, on account of their contradictions. This is\nprecisely why we are interested in them. We prefer not a mind but the\nreversals, the biography of a mind, the incompatibilities and aberrations to\nbe found there, in short those thinkers who, unable to conform to the rest of\nhumanity and still less to themselves, cheat as much by whim as by fatality.\n\f\nTheir distinctive sign? A touch of fakery in the tragic, a hint of dalliance\neven in the irremediable.\nIf, in her Foundations, Teresa of Avila lingers over the subject of\nmelancholia, it is because she recognizes it as incurable. Physicians, she\nsays, cannot deal with it, and the mother superior of a convent, faced with\nsuch sufferers, has but one recourse: to inspire them with the dread of\nauthority, to threaten them, to frighten them. The saint’s method remains the\nbest: only kicks, slaps, and a good beating will be effective in the case of a\n“depressive.” Moreover, such treatment is precisely what the “depressive”\nhimself resorts to when he decides to end it all: he merely employs more\nthorough means.\nIn relation to any act of life, the mind acts as a killjoy.\nEasy to imagine the elements, bored with their exhausted theme, disgusted\nby their invariable and utterly predictable combinations, seeking some\ndiversion: life would be merely a digression, merely an anecdote….\nAnything that can be done seems to me pernicious and at best futile. If need\nbe I can rouse myself but not act. I understand all too well Wordsworth’s\ndescription of Coleridge: eternal activity without action.\nWhenever something still seems possible, I have the sense I have been\nbewitched.\n\f\nThe one sincere confession is the one we make indirectly—when we talk\nabout other people.\nWe do not adopt a belief because it is true (they are all true), but because\nsome obscure power impels us to do so. When this power leaves us, we\nsuffer prostration and collapse, a tête-à-tête with what is left of ourselves.\n“The quality of every perfect form is to release the mind immediately,\nwhereas the corrupt form holds the mind prisoner, like a bad mirror which\ntells us of nothing but itself.” In Kleist’s praise—and how un-German it\nsounds—of limpidity, his target was not philosophy in particular. Yet his is\nthe best possible critique of philosophical jargon, a pseudo-language which,\nattempting to reflect ideas, merely assumes a contour at their expense,\nmerely denatures and darkens them, merely calls attention to itself. By one\nof the most troublesome of all usurpations, the word has taken the leading\nrole in a realm where it should be imperceptible.\n“O Satan, my Master, I give myself unto thee forever!” How I regret not\nremembering the name of the nun who, having written these words with a\nnail dipped in her own blood, deserves to figure in an anthology of prayer\nand concision.\nConsciousness is much more than the thorn, it is the dagger in the flesh.\nFerocity occurs in all conditions save in joy. Schadenfreude, malicious joy,\nis a misrepresentation. To do evil is a pleasure, not a joy. Joy, the one true\n\f\nvictory over the world, is pure in its essence, hence irreducible to pleasure,\nwhich is always suspect, both in itself and in its manifestations.\nAn existence constantly transfigured by failure.\nThe wise man consents to everything, for he identifies himself with nothing.\nAn opportunist without desires.\nNature’s great mistake was to have been unable to confine herself to one\n“kingdom”: juxtaposed with the vegetable, everything else seems\ninopportune, out of place. The sun should have sulked at the appearance of\nthe first insect, and gone out altogether with the advent of the chimpanzee.\nIf, as we grow older, we scrutinize our own past at the expense of\n“problems,” it is simply because we handle memories more readily than\nideas.\nThe last whose disloyalty wre forgive are those we have disappointed.\nWhat other people do we always feel we could do better. Unfortunately we\ndo not have the same feeling about what we ourselves do.\n“I was the Prophet,” Mohammed informs us, “when Adam was still\nbetween the water and the clay.” … When we have not had the pride to\n\f\nfound a religion—or at least to destroy one—how do we dare show\nourselves in the light of day?\nDetachment cannot be learned: it is inscribed in a civilization. We do not\ntend toward it, we discover it in ourselves. I was thinking this when I read\nthat a missionary, after eighteen years in Japan, had made only sixty\nconverts, and old ones at that Moreover they escaped him at the last\nmoment, dying in Japanese fashion, without remorse, without torments,\nworthy descendants of their ancestors who, to inure themselves, In the days\nof the Mongol wars, let themselves be impregnated by the nothingness of\nall things and by their own nothingness.\nWe can meditate upon eternity only in a prone position. For a considerable\nperiod, eternity was the Orientals’ principal concern: did they not prefer the\nhorizontal position? Once we lie down, time ceases to pass, to count.\nHistory is the product of a race that stands. As a vertical animal, man was to\nget into the habit of looking ahead, not only in space but in time as well. To\nwhich wretched origins we may trace the Future!\nEvery misanthrope, however sincere, at times reminds me of that old poet,\nbedridden and utterly forgotten, who in a rage with his contemporaries\ndeclared he would receive none of them. His wife, out of charity, would\nring at the door from time to time….\nA work is finished when we can no longer improve it, though we know it to\nbe inadequate and incomplete. We are so overtaxed by it that we no longer\nhave the power to add a single comma, however indispensable. What\ndetermines the degree to which a work is done is not a requirement of art or\nof truth, it is exhaustion and, even more, disgust."

To\nscribble a postcard comes closer to creative activity than to read The\nPhenomenology of Mind.\nBuddhism calls anger, “corruption of the mind,” manicheism “root of the\ntree of death.” I know this, but what good does it do me to know?\nShe meant absolutely nothing to me. Realizing, suddenly, after so many\nyears, that whatever happens i shall never see her again, I nearly collapsed.\nWe understand what death is only by suddenly remembering the face of\nsomeone who has been a matter of indifference to us.\nAs art sinks into paralysis, artists multiply. This anomaly ceases to be one if\nwe realize that art, on its way to exhaustion, has become both impossible\nand easy.\nNo one is responsible for what he is nor even for what he does. This is\nobvious and everyone more or less agrees that it is so. Then why celebrate\nor denigrate? Because to exist is to evaluate, to emit judgments, and\nbecause abstention, when it is not the effect of apathy or cowardice,\nrequires an effort no one manages to make.\nEvery form of haste, even toward the good, betrays some mental disorder.\n\f\nThe least impure thoughts are those which appear between our anxieties, in\nthe intervals of our annoyance, in those deluxe moments our misery grants\nitself.\nImaginary pains are by far the most real we suffer, since we feel a constant\nneed for them and invent them because there is no way of doing without\nthem.\nIf it is characteristic of the wise man to do nothing useless, no one will\nsurpass me in wisdom: I do not even lower myself to useful things.\nImpossible to imagine a degraded animal, a sub-animal.\nO to have been born before man!\nTry as I will, I cannot manage to scorn all those centuries during which men\nbusied themselves with nothing more than perfecting a definition of God.\nThe most effective way to avoid dejection, motivated or gratuitous, is to\ntake a dictionary, preferably of a language you scarcely know, and to look\nup word after word in it, making sure that they are the kind you will never\nuse….\n\f\nAs long as you live on this side of the terrible, you will find words to\nexpress it; once you know it from inside, you will no longer find a single\none.\nThere is no limit-disappointment.\nGrievances of every kind pass, but their source abides, and nothing has any\neffect on it: unassailable and unvarying, it is our fatum.\nTo realize, in rage and desolation alike, that nature, as Bossuet says, will not\nlong grant us “this morsel of matter she lends.”—This morsel of matter:. by\ndint of pondering it we reach peace, though a peace it would be better never\nto have known.\nParadox is not suited to burials, nor to weddings or births, in fact. Sinister—\nor grotesque—events require commonplaces; the terrible, like the painful,\naccommodates only the cliché.\nHowever disabused one may be, it is impossible to live without any hope at\nall. We always keep one, unwittingly, and this unconscious hope makes up\nfor all the explicit others we have rejected, exhausted.\nThe more laden he is with years, the more readily he speaks of his death as\na distant, quite unlikely event. Life is now such a habit that he has become\nunfit for death.\n\f\nA blind man, authentically blind for once, held out his hand: in his posture,\nhis rigidity, there was something that caught you, that made you hold your\nbreath. He was handing you his blindness.\nWe forgive only madmen and children for being frank with us: others, if\nthey have the audacity to imitate them, will regret it sooner or later.\nTo be “happy” you must constantly bear in mind the miseries you have\nescaped. This would be a way for memory to redeem itself, since ordinarily\nit preserves only disasters, eager—and with what success!—to sabotage\nhappiness.\nAfter a sleepless night, the people in the street seem automatons. No one\nseems to breathe, to walk. Each looks as if he is worked by clockwork:\nnothing spontaneous; mechanical smiles, spectral gesticulations. Yourself a\nspecter, how would you see others as alive?\nTo be sterile—with so many sensations! Perpetual poetry without words.\nPure fatigue—fatigue without cause, the kind that comes like a gift or a\nscourge: that is what helps me pull myself together, that is what affords me\nknowledge of my “self.” Once it leaves me, I am no more than an inanimate\nobject.\n\f\nAnything in folklore that remains alive comes from before Christianity. —\nThe same is true of whatever is alive in each of us.\nA man who fears ridicule will never go far, for good or ill: he remains on\nthis side of his talents, and even if he has genius, he is doomed to\nmediocrity.\n“Amid your most intense activities, pause a moment to ‘consider’ your\nmind”—this advice is surely not offered to those who “consider” their\nminds night and day, and who thereby have no need to suspend their\nactivities, for the good reason that they engage in none.\nOnly what has been conceived in solitude, face to face with God, endures—\nwhether one is a believer or not\nA passion for musk is in itself an avowal. We know more about a stranger\nwho yields himself up to it than about someone who Is deaf to musk and\nwhom we see every day.\nNo meditation without a tendency to repetitiveness.\nAs long as God had him in tow, man advanced slowly, so slowly he did not\neven realize it. Now that he no longer lives in anyone’s shadow, he is in a\nrush, and deplores it—he would give anything to regain the old cadence.\n\f\nWe have lost, being born, as much as we shall lose, dying. Everything.\nSatiety—I have just now uttered this word, and already I no longer know\napropos of what, so readily does it apply to everything I feel and think, to\neverything I love and loathe, to satiety itself.\nI have killed no one, I have done better: I have killed the Possible, and like\nMacbeth, what I need most is to pray, but like him too, I cannot say Amen.\n\f\n4\nTo deliver Mows none of which land, to attack everyone without anyone’s\nnoticing, to shoot arrows whose poison you alone receive!\nX, whom I have always treated as badly as I could, does not resent me\nbecause he resents no one. He forgives every insult, he even forgets them.\nHow I envy him! To be like him, I should have to live through several\nexistences and exhaust all my possibilities of transmigration.\nIn the days when I set off on month-long bicycle trips across France, my\ngreatest pleasure was to stop in country cemeteries, to stretch out between\ntwo graves, and to smoke for hours on end. I think of those days as the most\nactive period of my life.\nHow can you control yourself, master your behavior, when you come from\na country where people howl at funerals?\n\f\nOn certain mornings, no sooner have I stepped out the door than I hear\nvoices calling my name. Am I really me? Is it really my take another step, I\nstood there nailed to the spot, petrified IMPOSSIBILITY—this ordinary word\ncame, more apropos than usual, to enlighten me as to myself, no less than as\nto the word as well: it had so often come to my aid, yet never as now. At\nlast I understood, definitively, what it meant….\nAn ancient cleaning woman, in answer to my “How’s everything going?”\nanswers without looking up: “Taking its course.” This ultra-banal answer\nnearly brings me to tears.\nThe more such turns of speech, which deal with becoming, with the\npassage of time, with the course of things, are worn down, the more likely\nthey are to acquire the quality of a revelation. But the truth is not that they\ncreate an exceptional state, only that you yourself were in that state without\nrealizing it, and that it required only a sign or a pretext for the extraordinary\nto occur.\nWe lived in the country, I went to school, and—an important detail—I slept\nin my parents’ room. At night it was my father’s habit to read aloud to my\nmother. Though he was a Greek Orthodox priest, he would read anything,\ndoubtless assuming that at my age I wouldn’t understand. Usually I didn’t\neven listen and fell asleep, unless the text was some gripping story. One\nnight I pricked up my ears. He was reading the scene from a biography of\nRasputin where the father, on his deathbed, calls his son to him and says:\n“Go to Saint Petersburg and make yourself master of the city, fear nothing\nand no one, for God is an old hog.”\nSuch an enormity in my father’s mouth, for whom the priesthood was not\na joke, impressed me as much as a conflagration or an earthquake. But I\nalso distinctly recall—this was over fifty years ago—that my emotion was\nfollowed by a strange, dare I say a perverse pleasure."

    "raw_text": "Having penetrated, in the course of years, quite deeply into two or three\nreligions, I have always retreated on the threshold of “conversion,” lest I lie\nto myself. None of them was, in my eyes, free enough to admit that\nvengeance is a need, the most intense and profound of all, and that each\nman must satisfy it, if only in words. If we stifle that need, we expose\nourselves to serious disturbances. More than one disorder—perhaps all\ndisorders—derive from a vengeance too long postponed. We must learn\nhow to explode! Any disease is healthier than the one provoked by a\nhoarded rage.\nPhilosophy in the Morgue. “My nephew was obviously a failure. If he had\nsucceeded in making something of himself he would have had a different\nending than … this.” “You know, Madame,” I replied to the monumental\nmatron who had addressed me, “whether one succeeds or not comes down\nto the same thing.” “You’re right,” she said, after a few seconds’ thought.\nThis unexpected acquiescence on the part of such a woman moved me\nalmost as much as the death of my friend.\nMisfits … It seems to me that their adventure, more than any other, sheds a\nlight on the future, that they alone allow us to glimpse and to decipher it,\nand that if we set their exploits aside we utterly disqualify ourselves from\ndescribing the days to come.\n“A pity,” you were saying, “that N has never produced anything.”\n“So what! He exists. If he had given birth to books, if he had had the\nmisfortune to ‘realize’ himself, we wouldn’t have been talking about him\nthe last hour.” The advantage of being someone is rarer than that of\ncreating.

    "raw_text": "Filming a scene, there are countless takes of the same incident. Someone\nwatching in the street—obviously a provincial—can’t get over it: “After\nthis, I’ll never go to the movies again.”\nOne might react similarly with regard to anything whose underside one\nhas seen, whose secret one has seized. Yet, by an obnubilation which has\nsomething of the miraculous about it, there are gynecologists who are\nattracted to their patients, gravediggers who father children, incurables who\nlay plans, skeptics who write….\nT, a rabbi’s son, complains that this age of unprecedented persecutions has\nseen the birth of no original prayer capable of being adopted by the\ncommunity and uttered in the synagogues. I assure him that he is mistaken\nto be distressed or alarmed by the fact: the great disasters yield nothing on\nthe literary or religious level. Only the semi-misfortunes are fruitful,\nbecause they can be, because they are a point of departure, whereas too\nperfect a hell is almost as sterile as paradise.\nI was twenty. Everything was a burden. One day I collapsed on a couch\nwith an “I can’t take it any longer.” My mother, already driven distracted by\nmy sleepless nights, told me she had just had a mass said for my “rest.” Not\none but thirty thousand, I would have liked to shout at her, thinking of the\nfigure Charles V inscribed in his will—for a much longer rest, true enough.\nI ran across him again, quite by chance, after twenty-five years. Unchanged,\nintact, fresher than ever, he actually seems to have retreated toward\nadolescence.\nWhere has he been hiding, and what has he done to escape the action of\nthe years, to avoid our wrinkles and grimaces? And how has he lived, if in\n\f\nfact he has lived at all? Actually, a ghost. He must have cheated, he has not\nperformed his duty as a living man, not played the game. A ghost, yes, and a\ngate-crasher. I discern no sign of destruction on his countenance, none of\nthose marks which testify that one is a real being, an individual and not an\napparition. What can I say to him? I feel awkward, embarrassed, even\nafraid. So greatly are we upset by anyone who escapes time, or merely\ndeceives it.\nD.C, who was writing his recollections of childhood in his Rumanian\nvillage, having told his neighbor, a peasant named Coman, that he wouldn’t\nbe left out, received a visit from the latter early the next day: “I know I’m a\nworthless man but all the same I didn’t think I had fallen so low as to be\ntalked about in a book.”\nHow superior the oral world was to ours! Beings (I should say, peoples)\nlive in the truth only as long as they have a horror of the written. Once they\ncatch the virus, they enter the inauthentic, they lose their old superstitions to\nacquire a new one, worse than all the others combined.\nIncapable of getting up, nailed to my bed, I drift with the whims of my\nmemory, and I see myself wandering, as a child, in the Carpathians. One\nday I stumbled on a dog whose master, doubtless to be rid of it, had tied it\nto a tree; the animal was little more than a skeleton, so drained of life that it\nbarely had the strength to look at me, without being able to move. Yet it was\nstanding, that dog….\nA stranger comes and tells me he has killed someone. He is not wanted by\nthe police because no one suspects him. I am the only one who knows he is\nthe killer. What am I to do? I lack the courage as well as the treachery (for\nhe has entrusted me with a secret—and what a secret!) to tum him in. I feel\nI am his accomplice, and resign myself to being arrested and punished as\n\f\nsuch. At the same time, I tell myself this would be too ridiculous. Perhaps I\nshall go and denounce him all the same. And so on, until I wake up.\nThe interminable is the specialty of the indecisive. They cannot mark life\nout for their own, and still less their dreams, in which they perpetuate their\nhesitations, pusillanimities, scruples. They are ideally qualified for\nnightmare.\nA film about wild animals: endless cruelty in every latitude. “Nature,” a\ntorturer of genius, steeped in herself and her work, exults with good reason:\nthere is not a moment when what is alive fails to tremble, to make others\ntremble. Pity is a strange luxury only the most perfidious and the fiercest\ncreature could invent, out of a need to punish and torture itself—out of\nferocity, still.\nOn a poster which, at a church door, announces The Art of the Fugue,\nsomeone has scrawled in huge letters: God is dead. This apropos of the\ncomposer who testifies that God, in the event of his decease, can revive\nprecisely while we are listening to certain cantatas, certain fugues!\nWe have spent a little over an hour together. He has used the time to show\noff, and by dint of trying to say interesting things about himself, has\nsucceeded. If he had merely swaggered in moderation, I should have found\nhim a bore and left in a few minutes. By exaggerating, by playing the\npeacock to perfection, he has come close enough to wit to show some. The\ndesire to appear subtle does not destroy subtlety. A mental defective, if he\ncould feel the longing to astonish, would manage to deceive us—would\neven catch up with intelligence.\n\f\nX, who is older than the patriarchs, after inveighing, during a long tête-à-\ntête, against this one and that, tells me: “The great weakness of my life is\nthat I’ve never hated anyone.” Our hatred does not diminish with the years:\nin fact, it mounts. That of an old man like X attains incredible proportions:\nnow insensitive to his former affections, he puts all his faculties at the\nservice of his rancors which, miraculously reinvigorated, will survive the\ncrumbling of his memory and even of his reason.\n… The danger of frequenting the old is that when we find them so far\nfrom detachment and so incapable of espousing it, we arrogate to ourselves\nall the advantages they are supposed to have and do not. And it is inevitable\nthat our real or imaginary advance upon them in matters of weariness or\ndisgust should incite to presumption.\nEvery family has its own philosophy. One of my cousins, who died young,\nonce wrote me: “It’s all the way it’s always been and probably always will\nbe until there’s nothing left any more.”\nWhereas my mother ended the last note she ever sent me with this\ntestamentary sentence: “Whatever people try to do, they’ll regret it sooner\nor later.”\nNor can I even boast of having acquired this vice of regret by my own\nsetbacks. It precedes me, it participates in the patrimony of my tribe. What a\nlegacy, such unfitness for illusion!\nA few kilometers from the village where I was born, there was a hamlet,\nperched on a hill and inhabited solely by gypsies. In 1910 an amateur\nethnologist visited the place, accompanied by a photographer. He managed\nto collect the inhabitants, who agreed to let their picture be taken, without\nknowing what that meant. At the instant they were asked to hold still, an old\nwoman shrieked: “Watch out, they’re stealing our souls!” Whereupon they\nall flung themselves upon the two visitors, who had the greatest difficulty\nmaking their escape.\n\f\nThese half-savage gypsies—what were they but India, their land of origin\nwhich, under these circumstances, was speaking through them?\nIn continual rebellion against my ancestry, I have spent my whole life\nwanting to be something else: Spanish, Russian, cannibal—anything, except\nwhat I was. It is an aberration to want to be different from what you are, to\nespouse in theory any and every condition, except your own.\nThe day I read the list of nearly all the Sanskrit words that designate the\nabsolute, I realized that I had taken the wrong path, the wrong country, the\nwrong idiom.\nA friend, after I don’t know how many years of silence, writes that she\nhasn’t much longer to live, and that she is preparing to “enter the\nUnknown….” The cliché gives me a start. I find it hard to see what one\nmight enter by death. Any affirmation, in this realm, seems to me a\ndelusion. Death is not a state, perhaps not even a transition. Then what is it?\nAnd by what cliché, in my turn, will I answer my friend?\nI may change my opinion on the same subject, the same event, ten, twenty,\nthirty times in the course of a single day. And to think that each time, like\nthe worst impostor, I dare utter the word “truth”!\nHale and hearty still, the woman dragged her husband after her, a tall,\nhunched man, eyes staring; she dragged him as if he had been the survivor\nof another age, an apoplectic and suppliant diplodocus.\n\f\nAn hour later, a second encounter: a neatly dressed old woman,\nextremely stooped, “advanced” toward me; her body forming a perfect half\ncircle, she necessarily kept her eyes on the ground, doubtless counting her\nunimaginable slow tiny footsteps. It was as if she were learning how to\nwalk, as if she were afraid of not knowing how and where to place her feet\nin order to move.\n… Everything is good which brings me closer to Buddha.\nDespite her white hair, she still paraded up and down her part of the\nsidewalk, looking for customers. I would run into her often, at three in the\nmorning, and never felt like going home until I had heard her tell a few\nanecdotes or exploits. I have forgotten anecdotes and exploits alike, but not\nthe readiness with which, one night when I had begun storming against all\nthe sleeping ‘Vermin” of Paris, she broke in with her forefinger pointing to\nheaven and: “What about the vermin up there?’\n“Everything is without basis, without substance,” and I never repeat it to\nmyself without feeling something like happiness. Unfortunately there are so\nmany moments when I fail to repeat it to myself.\n\f\n5\nI read him for the shipwrecked feeling I get from anything he writes. At first\nyou follow, then you start going in circles, then you are caught up in a kind\nof mild unmenacing whirlpool, and you tell yourself you’re sinking, and\nthen you do sink. But you don’t really drown—that would be too easy! You\ncome back up to the surface, you follow all over again, amazed to see he\nseems to be saying something and to understand what it is, and then you\nstart going round and round again, and you sink once more…. All of which\nis meant to be profound, and seems so. But once you come to your senses\nyou realize it’s only abstruse, obscure, and that the distance between real\nprofundity and the willed kind is as great as between a revelation and a\nwhim.\nAnyone who gives himself up to writing believes—without realizing the\nfact—that his work will survive the years, the ages, time itself. … If he felt,\nwhile he was at work on it, that it was perishable, he would leave off where\nhe was, he could never finish. Activity and credulity are correlative terms.\n“Laughter ceased, and after laughter smiles.” This apparently naive remark\nby a biographer of Alexsandr Blok defines to perfection the program of any\nand every downfall.\n\f\nNo easy matter, to speak of God when one is neither, a believer nor an\natheist: and it is undoubtedly the drama we all share, theologians included\n—no longer capable of being either one or the other.\nFor a writer, progress toward detachment and deliverance is an\nunprecedented disaster. He, more than anyone else, needs his defects: if he\ntriumphs over them, he is lost He must be careful, then, not to improve, for\nif he succeeds, he will regret it bitterly.\nWe must beware of whatever insights we have into ourselves. Our self-\nknowledge annoys and paralyzes our daimon—this is where we should look\nfor the reason Socrates wrote nothing.\nWhat makes bad poets worse is that they read only poets (just as bad\nphilosophers read only philosophers), whereas they would benefit much\nmore from a book of botany or geology. We are enriched only by\nfrequenting disciplines remote from our own. This is true, of course, only\nfor realms where the ego is rampant.\nTertullian tells us that in order to be cured, epileptics would go “and\ngreedily suck the blood of criminals slaughtered in the arena.” If I were to\nheed my instinct, this would be the one type of medication, no matter what\nthe disease, which I would adopt.\n\f\nWhat right have we to be annoyed by someone who calls us a monster? The\nmonster Is unique by definition, and solitude, even the solitude of infamy,\nsupposes something positive, a peculiar election, but undeniably an\nelection.\nTwo enemies—the same man divided.\n“Never judge a man without putting yourself in his place.” This old proverb\nmakes all judgment impossible, for we judge someone only because, in fact,\nwe cannot put ourselves in his place.\nIf you love your independence, you must lend yourself, in order to protect\nit, to every turpitude; you must risk ignominy itself.\nNothing more abominable than the critic and, a fortiori, the philosopher in\neach of us: if I were a poet, I should behave like Dylan Thomas, who, when\npeople would discuss his poems in his presence, would drop to the floor in a\nfit of convulsions.\nAnyone who bestirs himself commits one injustice after the next, without a\ntrace of remorse. Just bad humor. —Remorse is for those who do nothing,\nwho cannot act. It replaces action for them, consoles them for their\ninefiectuality.\nMost of our troubles come from our first impulses. The slightest enthusiasm\ncosts more than a crime.\n\f\nSince we remember clearly only our ordeals, it is ultimately the sick, the\npersecuted, the victims in every realm who will have lived to the best\nadvantage. The others—the lucky ones—have a life, of course, but not the\nmemory of a life.\nWhat a bore, someone who doesn’t deign to make an impression. Vain\npeople are almost always annoying, but they make an effort, they take the\ntrouble: they are bores who don’t want to be bores, and we are grateful to\nthem for that: we end by enduring them, even by seeking them out. On the\nother hand, we turn livid with fury in the presence of someone who pays no\nattention whatever to the effect he makes. What are we to say to him, and\nwhat are we to expect from him? Either keep some vestiges of the monkey,\nor else stay home.\nNot the fear of effort but the fear of success explains more than one failure.\nI’d like to pray with dagger-words. Unfortunately, if you pray at all, you\nhave to pray like everyone else. Wherein abides one of the greatest\ndifficulties of faith.\nWe dread the future only when we are not sure we can kill ourselves when\nwe want to.\nNeither Bossuet, nor Malebranche, nor Fénelon deigned to mention the\nPensées: apparently Pascal didn’t strike them as sufficiently serious.\n\f\nFear is the antidote to boredom: the remedy must be stronger than the\ndisease.\nIf only I could reach the level of the man I would have liked to be! But\nsome power, increasing year by year, draws me down. Even to get back up\nto my surface, I have to employ stratagems I cannot think of without\nblushing.\nThere was a time when, in order to dispel any impulse of vengeance once I\nhad endured some affront, I would imagine myself quite still in my grave.\nAnd I calmed down at once. We must not despise our corpse too much: it\ncan be useful on occasion.\nEvery thought derives from a thwarted sensation.\nThe only way to reach another person at any depth is to move toward what\nis deepest in yourself. In other words, to take the opposite path from the one\nfollowed by so-called generous minds.\nIf only I could say with that Hasidic rabbi: “The blessing of my life is that I\nhave never needed a thing before I possessed it!”\nIn permitting man, Nature has committed much more than a mistake in her\ncalculations: a crime against herself.\n\f\nFear creates consciousness—not natural fear but morbid fear. Otherwise\nanimals would have achieved a level of consciousness higher than ours.\nAs orangutang in the strict sense of the word, man is old; as historical\norangutang, he is comparatively recent: a parvenu who has not had time to\nlearn how to behave in life.\nAfter certain experiences, we should change names, since we ourselves are\nno longer the same. Everything assumes another aspect, starting with death.\nWhich seems close and desirable: we are reconciled to it, and we reach the\npoint of calling it “man’s best friend,” as Mozart does in a letter to his dying\nfather.\nWe must suffer to the end, to the moment when we stop believing in\nsuffering.\n“Truth remains hidden to the man filled with desire and hatred”\n(Buddha)…. Which is to say, to every man alive.\nWon over by solitude, yet he remains in the world: a stylite without a pillar.\n“You were wrong to count on me.” Who can speak in such terms? God and\nthe Failure."

    "raw_text": "Everything we achieve, everything that comes out of us, aspires to forget its\norigins, and succeeds only by opposing us. Hence the negative sign that\nmarks all our successes.\nThere is nothing to say about anything. So there can be no limit to the\nnumber of books.\nFailure, even repeated, always seems fresh; whereas success, multiplied,\nloses all interest, all attraction. It is not misfortune but happiness—insolent\nhappiness, it is true—which leads to rancor and sarcasm.\n“An enemy is as useful as a Buddha.” Exactly, for our enemy watches over\nus, keeps us from letting ourselves go. By indicating, by divulging our least\nweakness, he leads us straight to our salvation, moves heaven and earth to\nkeep us from being unworthy of his image of us. Hence our gratitude to him\nshould be boundless.\nWe get a better hold of ourselves and of being when we have reacted\nagainst negating, dissolving books—against their noxious power. Fortifying\nbooks, actually, since they provoke the very energy which denies them. The\nmore poison they contain, the more salutary their effect, provided we read\nthem against the grain, as we should read any book, starting with the\ncatechism.\n\f\nThe greatest favor we can do an author is to forbid him to work during a\ncertain period. Short-term tyrannies are necessary—prohibitions which\nwould suspend all intellectual activity. Uninterrupted freedom of expression\nexposes talent to a deadly danger, forces it beyond its means and keeps it\nfrom stockpiling sensations and experiences. Unlimited freedom is a crime\nagainst the mind.\nSelf-pity is not so sterile as we suppose. Once we feel its mere onset, we\nassume a thinker’s attitude, and come to think of it, we come to think!\nThe stoic’s maxim, according to which we should submit uncomplainingly\nto things which do not depend on ourselves, takes into account only\nexternal misfortunes, which escape our will. But how to accommodate\nourselves to those which come from ourselves? If we are the source of our\nills, whom are we to confront? Ourselves? We manage, luckily, to forget\nthat we are the guilty parties, and moreover existence is tolerable only if we\ndaily renew this lie, this act of oblivion.\nAll my life, I have lived with the feeling that I have been kept from my true\nplace. If the expression “metaphysical exile” had no meaning, my existence\nalone would afford it one.\nThe more gifted a man is, the less progress he makes on the spiritual level.\nTalent is an obstacle to the inner life.\nTo save the word “grandeur” from officialdom, we should use it only\napropos of insomnia or heresy.\n\f\nIn classical India, the sage and the saint were combined in one and the same\nperson. To have any notion of such a success, we must imagine, if we can, a\nfusion between resignation and ecstasy, between a cold stoic and a\ndisheveled mystic.\nBeing is suspect. Then what is to be said of “life,” which is its deviation and\nstigma?\nWhen someone tells us of an unfavorable opinion about ourselves, instead\nof being distressed, we should think of all the “evil” we have spoken of\nothers, and realize that it is only justice that as much should be said of\nourselves. Ironically, no one is more vulnerable, more susceptible, and less\nlikely to acknowledge his own defects than the backbiter. Merely tell him\nabout the slightest reservation someone has made in his regard, and he will\nlose countenance, lose his temper, and drown in his own bile.\nSeen from the outside, harmony reigns in every sect, clan, and party; seen\nfrom the inside, discord. Conflicts in a monastery are as frequent and as\nenvenomed as in any society. Even when they desert hell, men do so only to\nreconstruct it elsewhere.\nThe least conversion is experienced as an advance. Fortunately there exist\nexceptions.\nOne of my favorites is that eighteenth-century Jewish sect in which men\nwent over to Christianity in order to debase themselves; and another is that\nSouth American Indian who, upon conversion, lamented that he must now"

    "raw_text": "become the prey of worms instead of being eaten by his children, an honor\nhe would have enjoyed had he not abjured his tribe’s beliefs.\nOnly normal that man should no longer be interested in religion but in\nreligions, for only through them will he be in a position to understand the\nmany versions of his spiritual collapse.\nWhen we recapitulate the stages of our career, it is humiliating to realize\nthat we have not had the disasters we deserved, the ones we were entitled to\nexpect.\nIn some men, the prospect of a more or less imminent end excites energy,\ngood or bad, and plunges them into a frenzy of activity. Artless enough to\ntry to perpetuate themselves by their endeavor, by their work, they move\nheaven and earth to finish, to conclude it: not a moment to lose.\nThe same perspective invites others to founder in what’s-the-use, in a\nstagnant clear-sightedness, in the unimpeachable truths of despond.\n“My curse on the man who, in future editions of my works, knowingly\nchanges anything—a sentence, or only a word, a syllable, a letter, a\npunctuation mark!” Is it the philosopher or the writer in Schopenhauer who\nspeaks this way? Both at once, and this conjunction (when we think of the\nawful style of any philosophical work) is extremely rare. It is not a Hegel\nwho would have uttered such a curse. Nor any other major philosopher,\nexcept Plato.\n\f\nNothing more aggravating than a seamless, unremitting irony which leaves\nyou no time to breathe and still less to think; which instead of being\ninconspicuous, occasional, is massive, automatic, at the antipodes of its\nessentially delicate nature. Which in any case is how it is used in Germany,\na nation which, having meditated upon it the most, is least capable of\nwielding it.\nAnxiety is not provoked: it tries to find a justification for itself, and in order\nto do so seizes upon anything, the vilest pretexts, to which it clings once it\nhas invented them. A reality which precedes its particular expressions, its\nvarieties, anxiety provokes itself, engenders itself, it is “infinite creation,”\nand as such is more likely to suggest the workings of the divinity than those\nof the psyche.\nAutomatic melancholy: an elegiac robot.\nAt a grave, the words: game, imposture, joke, dream, come to mind.\nImpossible to think that existence is a serious phenomenon. Certainty of\nfaking from the start, at bottom. Over the gate of our cemeteries should be\nwritten: “Nothing Is Tragic. Everything Is Unreal.”\nI shall not soon forget the expression of horror on what was his face, the\ndread, the extreme suffering, and the aggression. No, he was not happy.\nNever have I seen a man so uncomfortable in his coffin.\nLook neither ahead nor behind, look into yourself, with neither fear nor\nregret. No one descends into himself so long as he remains a slave of the\n\f\npast or of the future.\nInelegant to reproach a man for his sterility, when that is his postulate, his\nmode of achievement, his dream….\nNights when we have slept are as if they had never been. The only ones that\nremain in our memory are the ones when we couldn’t close our eyes: night\nmeans sleepless night.\nIn order not to have to resolve them, I have turned all my practical\ndifficulties into theoretical ones. Faced with the Insoluble, I breathe at\nlast….\nTo a student who wanted to know where I stood with regard to the author of\nZarathustra, I replied that I had long since stopped reading him. Why? “I\nfind him too naïve….”\nI hold his enthusiasms, his fervors against him. He demolished so many\nidols only to replace them with others: a false iconoclast, with adolescent\naspects and a certain virginity, a certain innocence inherent in his solitary’s\ncareer. He observed men only from a distance. Had he come closer, he\ncould have neither conceived nor promulgated the superman, that\npreposterous, laughable, even grotesque chimera, a crotchet which could\noccur only to a mind without time to age, to know the long serene disgust of\ndetachment.\nMarcus Aurelius Is much closer to me. Not a moment’s hesitation\nbetween the lyricism of frenzy and the prose of acceptance: I find more\ncomfort, more hope even, in the weary emperor than in the thundering\nprophet.\n\f\n6\nAppealing, that Hindu notion of entrusting our salvation to someone else, to\na chosen “saint,” and permitting him to pray in our place, to do anything in\norder to save us. Selling our soul to God….\n“Does talent have any need of passions? Yes, of many passions—repressed”\n(Joubert). Not one moralist we cannot convert into a precursor of Freud.\nIt is always surprising to discover that the great mystics produced so much,\nthat they left so many treatises. Undoubtedly their intention was to celebrate\nGod and nothing else. This is true in part, but only in part.\nWe do not create a body of work without attaching ourselves to it,\nwithout subjugating ourselves to it. Writing is the least ascetic of all actions.\nWhen I lie awake far into the night, I am visited by my evil genius, as\nBrutus was by his before the battle of Philippi.\n\f\n“Do I look like someone who has something to do here on earth?” —That’s\nwhat I’d like to answer the busybodies who inquire into my activities.\nIt has teen said that a metaphor “must be able to te drawn.” Whatever is\noriginal and lasting in literature for at lost a century contradicts this remark.\nFor if anything has outlived its usefulness it is “coherent” metaphor, one\nwith explicit contours. It is against such metaphor that poetry has\nunceasingly rebelled, to the point where a dead poetry is a poetry afflicted\nwith coherence.\nListening to the weather report, I feel a strong response to the words\n“scattered rain.” Which certainly proves that poetry is in ourselves and not\nin the expression, though scattered is an adjective capable of setting up a\ncertain vibration.\nOnce I formulate a doubt, or more exactly, once I feel the need to formulate\na doubt, I experience a curious, disturbing well-being. It would be far easier\nfor me to live without a trace of belief than without a trace of doubt.\nDevasting doubt, nourishing doubt!\nThere is no fake sensation.\nWithdraw into yourself, perceive there a silence as old as being, even\nolder….\n\f\nIf I detest man, I could not say with the same case: I detest the human\nbeing, for in spite of everything there is something more, something\nenigmatic and engaging in that word being which suggests qualities alien to\nthe idea of man.\nIn the Dhammapada, it is suggested that, in order to achieve deliverance,\nwe must be rid of the double yoke of Good and Evil. That Good itself\nshould be one of our fetters we are too spiritually retarded to be able to\nadmit. And so we shall not be delivered.\nEverything turns on pain; the rest is accessory, even nonexistent, for we\nremember only what hurts. Painful sensations being the only real ones, it is\nvirtually useless to experience others.\nI believe with that madman Calvin that we are predestined to salvation or\ndamnation in our mother’s womb. We have already lived our life before\nbeing born.\nA free man is one who has discerned the inanity of all points of view; a\nliberated man is one who has drawn the consequences of such discernment.\nWe had nothing to say to one another, and while I was manufacturing my\nphrases I felt that the earth was falling through space and that I was falling\nwith it at a speed that made me dizzy.\n\f\nYears and years to waken from that sleep in which the others loll; then years\nand years to escape that awakening …\nA task to be done, something I have undertaken out of necessity or choice:\nno sooner have I started in than everything seems important, everything\nattracts me, except that.\nThink about those who haven’t long to live, who know that everything is\nover and done with, except the time in which the thought of their end\nunrolls. Deal with that time. Write for gladiators….\nErosion of our being by our infirmities: the resulting void is filled by the\npresence of consciousness, what am I saying?—that void is consciousness\nitself.\nMoral disintegration when we spend time in a place that is too beautiful: the\nself dissolves upon contact with paradise. No doubt it was to avoid this\ndanger that the first man made the choice he did.\nAll things considered, there have teen more affirmations than negations—at\nleast till now. So we may deny without remorse. Beliefs will always weigh\nmore in the scales.\nThe substance of a work is the impossible—what we have not been able to\nattain, what could not te given to us: the sum of all the things which were\nrefused us."

Before, we had the luck not to exist; now we\nexist, and it is this particle of existence, hence of misfortune, which dreads\ndeath. Particle is not the word, since each of us prefers himself to the\nuniverse, at any rate considers himself equal to it.\nWhen we discern the unreality of everything, we ourselves become unreal,\nwe begin to survive ourselves, however powerful our vitality, however\nimperious our instincts. But they are no longer anything but false instincts,\nand false vitality.\nIf you are doomed to devour yourself, nothing can keep you from it: a trifle\nwill impel you as much as a tragedy. Resign yourself to erosion at all times:\nyour fate wills it so.\nTo live is to lose ground.\n\f\nTo think that so many have succeeded in dying!\nImpossible not to resent those who write us overwhelming letters.\nIn a remote province of India, everything was explained by dreams, and\nwhat is more important, dreams were used to cure diseases as well. It was\naccording to dreams that business was conducted and matters of life and\ndeath decided. Until the English came. Since then, one native said, “We no\nlonger dream.”\nIn what we have agreed to call “civilization,” there resides, undeniably, a\ndiabolic principle man has become conscious of too late, when it was no\nlonger possible to remedy it.\nLucidity without the corrective of ambition leads to stagnation. It is\nessential that the one sustain the other, that the one combat the other without\nwinning, for a work, for a life to be possible.\nWe cannot forgive those we have praised to the skies, we are impatient to\nbreak with them, to snap the most delicate chain of all: the chain of\nadmiration …, not out of insolence, but out of an aspiration to find our\nbearings, to be free, to be … ourselves. Which we manage only by an act of\ninjustice.\nThe problem of responsibility would have a meaning only if we had been\nconsulted before our birth and had consented to be precisely who we are.\n\f\nThe energy and virulence of my taedium vitae continue to astound me. So\nmuch vigor in a disease so decrepit! To this paradox I owe my present\nincapacity to choose my final hour.\nFor our actions, for our vitality itself, the claim to lucidity is as ruinous as\nlucidity itself.\nChildren turn, and must turn, against their parents, and the parents can do\nnothing about it, for they are subject to a law which decrees the relations\namong all the living: i.e., that each engenders his own enemy.\nSo carefully have we been taught to cling to things that when we would be\nfree of them, we do not know how to go about it. And if death did not come\nto our aid, our stubbornness in subsisting would make us find a recipe for\nexistence beyond wearing out, beyond senility itself\nEverything is wonderfully clear if we admit that birth is a disastrous or at\nleast an inopportune event; but if we think otherwise, we must resign\nourselves to the unintelligible, or else cheat like everyone else.\nIn a Gnostic work of the second century of our era, we read: “The prayer of\na melancholy man will never have the strength to rise unto God.” … Since\nman prays only in despondency, we may deduce that no prayer has ever\nreached its destination.\n\f\nHe was above all others, and had had nothing to do with it: he had simply\nforgotten to desire….\nIn ancient China, women suffering from anger or grief would climb onto\nplatforms specially constructed for them in the street, and there would give\nfree rein to their fury or their lamentations. Such confessionals should be\nrevived and adopted the world over, if only to replace the obsolete ones of\nthe Church, or the ineffectual ones of various therapeutics.\nThis philosopher lacks keeping or, to use the jargon, “internal form.” He is\ntoo fabricated to be alive or even “real”—a sinister puppet. What bliss to\nknow I shall never open his books again!\nNo one exclaims he is feeling well and that he is free, yet this is what all\nwho know this double blessing should do. Nothing condemns us more than\nour incapacity to shout our good luck.\nTo have failed in everything, always, out of a love of discouragement!\nThe sole means of protecting your solitude is to offend everyone, beginning\nwith those you love.\nA book is a postponed suicide."

He\nrepresents, enlarged, our advantages and our miseries, he proclaims us, he is\nour standard-bearer.\nOver the centuries, man has slaved to believe, passing from dogma to\ndogma, illusion to illusion, and has given very little time to doubts, short\nintervals between his epochs of blindness. Indeed they were not doubts but\npauses, moments of respite following the fatigue of faith, of any faith.\nInnocence being the perfect state, perhaps the only one, it is\nincomprehensible that a man enjoying it should seek to leave it. Yet history\nfrom its beginnings down to ourselves is only that and nothing but that.\nI draw the curtains, and I wait. Actually, I am not waiting for anything, I am\nmerely making myself absent. Scoured, if only for a few minutes, of the\nimpurities which dim and clog the mind, I accede to a state of\nconsciousness from which the self is evacuated, and I am as soothed as if I\nwere resting outside the universe.\nIn one medieval exorcism, all the parts of the body, even the smallest, are\nlisted from which the demon is ordered to depart: a kind of lunatic anatomy\ntreatise, fascinating for its hypertrophy of precision, its profusion of\nunexpected details. A scrupulous incantation. Leave the nails! Fanatic but\nnot without poetic effect. For authentic poetry has nothing in common with\n“poetry.”\n\f\nIn all our dreams, even if they deal with the Flood, there Is always, if only\nfor a fraction of a second, some minuscule Incident we witnessed the day\nbefore. This regularity, which I have verified for years, is the only constant,\nthe only law or semblance of law I have been able to discern In night’s\nincredible chaos.\nThe dissolving power of conversation. One realizes why both meditation\nand action require silence.\nThe certainty of being only an accident has accompanied me on all\noccasions, propitious or injurious, and if it has saved me from the\ntemptation to believe myself necessary, it has not on the other hand entirely\ncured me of a certain vainglory inherent in the loss of illusions.\nRare to come upon a free mind, and when you do, you realize that the best\nof such a mind is not revealed in its works (when we write we bear,\nmysteriously, chains) but in those confidences where, released from\nconviction and pose, as from all concern with rigor or standing, it displays\nits weaknesses. And where it behaves as a heretic to itself.\nIf the foreigner is not a creator in the matter of language, it is because he\nwants to do as well as the natives: whether or not he succeeds, this ambition\nis his downfall.\nI begin a letter over and over again, I get nowhere: what to say and how to\nsay it? I don’t even remember whom I was writing to. Only passion or\nprofit find at once the right tone. Unfortunately detachment is indifference\n\f\nto language, insensitivity to words. Yet It is by losing contact with words\nthat we lose contact with human beings.\nEveryone has had, at a given moment, an extraordinary experience which\nwill be for him, because of the memory of it he preserves, the crucial\nobstacle to his Inner metamorphosis.\nI know peace only when my ambitions sleep. Once they waken, anxiety\nrepossesses me. Life is a state of ambition. The mole digging his tunnels Is\nambitious. Ambition is in effect everywhere, and we see its traces on the\nfaces of the dead themselves.\nGoing to India because of the Vedanta or Buddhism is about the same as\ngoing to France because of Jansenism. Moreover the latter is more recent,\nsince it vanished only three centuries ago.\nNot the slightest trace of reality anywhere—except in my sensations of\nunreality.\nExistence would be a quite impracticable enterprise if we stopped granting\nimportance to what has none.\nWhy docs the Gita rank “renunciation of the fruit of actions” so high?\nBecause such renunciation is rare, impracticable, contrary to our nature, and\nbecause achieving it is destroying the man one has been and one is, killing\n\f\nin oneself the entire past, the work of millennia—in a word, freeing oneself\nof the Species, that hideous and immemorial riffraff.\nWe should have abided by our larval condition, dispensed with evolution,\nremained incomplete, delighting in the elemental siesta and calmly\nconsuming ourselves in an embryonic ecstasy.\nTruth abides in the individual drama. If I suffer authentically, I suffer much\nmore than an individual, I transcend the sphere of my selfhood, I rejoin the\nessence of others. The only way to proceed toward the universal is to\nconcern ourselves exclusively with what concerns ourselves.\nWhen we are fixated on doubt, we take more pleasure in lavishing\nspeculations upon it than in practicing it.\nIf you want to know a nation, frequent its second-order writers: they alone\nreflect its true nature. The others denounce or transfigure the nullity of their\ncompatriots, and neither can nor will put themselves on the same level.\nThey are suspect witnesses.\nIn my youth there would be weeks during which I never closed my eyes. I\nlived in the unlived world, I had the sense that Time, with all its moments,\nhad concentrated itself within me, where it culminated, where it triumphed.\nI moved it onward, of course, I was its promoter and bearer, its cause and\nsubstance, and it was as an agent and accomplice that I participated in its\napotheosis. When sleep departs from us, the unheard-of becomes everyday,\neasy: we enter it without preparations, inhabit it, wallow in it.\n\f\nAstounding, the number of hours I have wasted on ? the “meaning” of what\nexists, of what happens…. But that “what” has no meaning, as all serious\nminds know. Hence they devote their time and their energy to more useful\nundertakings.\nMy affinities with Russian Byronism, from Pechorin to Stavro-gin, my\nboredom and my passion for boredom.\nX, whom I do not particularly appreciate, was telling a story so stupid that I\nwakened with a start: those we don’t like rarely shine in our dreams.\nFor lack of occupation, the old seem to be trying to solve something very\ncomplicated, devoting to it all the capacities they still possess. Perhaps this\nis why they do not commit suicide en masse, as they ought were they even a\ntrifle less absorbed.\nLove at its most impassioned does not bring two human beings so close\ntogether as calumny. Inseparable, slanderer and slandered constitute a\n“transcendent” unity, forever welded one to the other. Nothing can separate\nthem. One inflicts harm, the other endures it, but if he endures it, it is\nbecause he is accustomed to doing so, can no longer do without it, even\ninsists upon it. He knows that his wishes will be gratified, that he will never\nbe forgotten, that whatever happens he will be eternally present in the mind\nof his indefatigable benefactor."

    "raw_text": "Joy is a light which devours itself, inexhaustibly; it is the sun early on.\nA few days before he died, Claudel remarked that we should not call God\ninfinite but inexhaustible. As if it did not come down to the same thing, or\njust about! All the same, this concern for exactitude, this verbal scruple at\nthe moment that he was writing that his “lease” on life had nearly expired,\nis more inspiring than a “sublime” word or gesture.\nThe unusual is not a criterion. Paganini is more surprising and more\nunpredictable than Bach.\nWe should repeat to ourselves, every day: I am one of the billions dragging\nhimself across the earth’s surface. One, and no more. This banality justifies\nany conclusion, any behavior or action: debauchery, chastity, suicide, work,\ncrime, sloth, or rebellion, … Whence it follows that each man is right to do\nwhat he does.\nTsimtsum. This silly-sounding word designates a major concept of the\nCabbala. For the world to exist, God, who was everything and everywhere,\nconsented to shrink, to leave a vacant space not inhabited by Himself: it is\nin this “hole” that the world occurred.\nThus we occupy the wasteland He conceded to us out of pity or whim.\nFor us to exist, He contracted, He limited His sovereignty. We are the\nproduct of His voluntary reduction, of His effacement, of His partial\nabsence. In His madness He has actually amputated Himself for us. If only\nHe had had the good sense and the good taste to remain whole!\n\f\nIn the “Gospel According to the Egyptians,” Jesus proclaims: “Men will be\nthe victims of death so long as women give birth.” And he specifies: “I am\ncome to destroy the works of woman.”\nWhen we frequent the extreme truths of the Gnostics, we should like to\ngo, if possible, still further, to say something never said, which petrifies or\npulverizes history, something out of a cosmic Neronianism, out of a\nmadness on the scale of matter.\nTo express an obsession is to project it outside yourself, to hunt it down, to\nexorcise it. Obsessions are the demons of a world without faith.\nMan accepts death but not the hour of his death. To die any time, except\nwhen one has to die!\nOnce we step into a cemetery, a feeling of utter mockery does away with\nany metaphysical concern. Those who look for “mystery” everywhere do\nnot necessarily get to the bottom of things. Most often “mystery,” like “the\nabsolute,” corresponds only to a mannerism of the mind. It is a word we\nshould use only when we cannot do otherwise, in really desperate cases.\nIf I recapitulate my plans which have remained plans and those which have\nworked out, I have every reason to regret that these latter have not suffered\nthe fate of the former.\n“He who is inclined to lust is merciful and tender-hearted; those who are\ninclined to purity are not so” (Saint John Climacus). It took a saint, neither\n\f\nmore nor less, to denounce so distinctly and so vigorously not the lies but\nthe very essence of Christian morality, and indeed of all morality.\nWe are not afraid to accept the notion of an uninterrupted sleep; on the other\nhand an eternal awakening (immortality, if it were conceivable, would be\njust that) plunges us into dread. Unconsciousness is a country, a fatherland;\nconsciousness, an exile.\nAny profound impression is voluptuous or funereal—or both at once.\nNo one has been so convinced as I of the futility of everything; and no one\nhas taken so tragically so many futile things.\nIshi, the last American Indian of his tribe, after hiding for years in terror of\nthe White Men, reduced to starvation, surrendered of his own free will to\nthe exterminators of his people, believing that the same treatment was in\nstore for himself. He was made much of. He had no posterity, he was truly\nthe last.\nOnce humanity is destroyed or simply extinguished, we may imagine a\nsole survivor who would wander the earth, without even having anyone to\nsurrender to….\nDeep in his heart, man aspires to rejoin the condition he had before\nconsciousness. History is merely the detour he takes to get there."

Eternity? Which itself is only an\ninfirmity of God.\n\f\n8\nWithout the notion of a failed universe, the spectacle of injustice in every\nsystem would put even an abulic into a straitjacket.\nAnnihilating affords a sense of power, flatters something obscure,\nsomething original in us. It is not by erecting but by pulverizing that we\nmay divine the secret satisfactions of a god. Whence the lure of destruction\nand the illusions it provokes among the frenzied of any era.\nEach generation lives in the absolute: it behaves as if it had reached the\napex if not the end of history.\nAny and every nation, at a certain moment of its career, considers itself\nchosen. It is at this moment that it gives the best and the worst of itself.\nNo accident that the Trappist order was founded in France rather than in\nItaly or Spain. Granted the Spanish and the Italians talk ceaselessly, but\nthey do not hear themselves talk, whereas the Frenchman relishes his\n\f\neloquence, never forgets he is talking, is consummately conscious of the\nfact He alone could regard silence as an ordeal, as an askesis.\nWhat spoils the French Revolution for me is that it all happens on stage,\nthat its promoters are born actors, that the guillotine is merely a decor. The\nhistory of France, as a whole, seems a bespoke history, an acted history:\neverything in it is perfect from the theatrical point of view. It is a\nperformance, a series of gestures and events which are watched rather than\nsuffered, a spectacle that takes ten centuries to put on. Whence the\nimpression of frivolity which even the Terror affords, seen from a distance.\nProsperous societies are far more fragile than the others, since it remains for\nthem to achieve only their own ruin, comfort not being an ideal when we\npossess it, still less of one when it has been around for generations. Not to\nmention the fact that nature has not included well-being in her calculations\nand could not do so without perishing herself.\nIf all peoples turned apathetic at once, there would be no more conflicts, no\nmore wars, no more empires. But unfortunately there are young peoples,\nand indeed young people—a major obstacle to the philanthropists’ dreams:\nto bring it about that all men might reach the same degree of lassitude or\nineffectual-Ity….\nWe must side with the oppressed on every occasion, even when they are in\nthe wrong, though without losing sight of the fact that they are molded of\nthe same clay as their oppressors.\n\f\nCharacteristic of dying regimes: to permit a confused mixture of beliefs and\ndoctrines, and to give the Illusion, at the same time, that the moment of\nchoice can be indefinitely postponed …\nThis is the source—the sole source—of the charm of pre-revolutionary\nperiods.\nOnly false values prevail, because everyone can assimilate them, counterfeit\nthem (false thereby to the second degree). An idea that succeeds is\nnecessarily a pseudo-idea.\nRevolutions are the sublime of bad literature.\nThe unfortunate thing about public misfortunes is that everyone regards\nhimself as qualified to talk about them.\nThe right to suppress everyone that bothers us should rank first in the\nconstitution of the ideal State.\nThe only thing the young should be taught is that there is virtually nothing\nto be hoped for from life. One dreams of a Catalogue of Disappointments\nwhich would include all the disillusionments reserved for each and every\none of us, to be posted in the schools.\nAccording to the Princess Palatine, Mme de Maintenon was in the habit of\nrepeating, during the years after the king’s death when she had no further\n\f\nrole to play: “For some time now, there has prevailed a spirit of vertigo\nwhich is spreading everywhere.’ This “spirit of vertigo” is what the losers\nhave always noticed, correctly moreover, and we might well reconsider all\nhistory from the perspective of this formula.\nProgress is the injustice each generation commits with regard to its\npredecessor.\nThe surfeited hate themselves—not secretly but publicly, and long to be\nswept away, one way or another. They prefer, in any case, that the sweeping\nbe accomplished with their own cooperation. This is the most curious, the\nmost original aspect of a revolutionary situation.\nA nation generates only one revolution. The Germans have never repeated\nthe exploit of the Reformation, or rather, they have repeated but not equaled\nit. France has remained an eternal tributary of ‘89. Equally true of Russia\nand of all nations, this tendency to plagiarize oneself in regard to\nrevolutions is at once reassuring and distressing.\nRomans of the decadence enjoyed only what they called Greek leisure\n(otium graecum), the thing they had most despised in the period of their\nvigor. The analogy with today’s civilizations is so flagrant it would be\nindecent to insist on it.\nAlaric claimed that a “demon” drove him against Rome. Every exhausted\ncivilization awaits its barbarian, and every barbarian awaits his demon.\n\f\nThe West: a sweet-smelling rottenness, a perfumed corpse.\nAll these nations were great because they had great prejudices. They now\nhave none. Are they nations still? At most, disintegrated crowds.\nThe white race increasingly deserves the name given by the American\nIndians: palefaces.\nIn Europe, happiness stops at Vienna. Beyond, misery upon misery, since\nthe beginning.\nThe Romans, the Turks, and the British could found lasting empires\nbecause, refractory to all doctrine, they imposed none upon the subject\nnations. They would never have managed to wield so long a hegemony had\nthey been afflicted with some messianic vice Unhoped-for oppressors,\nadministrators, and parasites, lords without convictions, they had the art of\ncombining authority and indifference, rigor and abandon. It is this art, the\nsecret of the true master, which the Spaniards of old lacked, as it is lacking\nin the conquerors of our own day.\nSo long as a nation keeps the awareness of its superiority, it is fierce and\nrespected; once it loses that awareness, a nation becomes humanized, and\nno longer counts.\n\f\nWhen I rage against the age, I can calm myself merely by thinking of what\nwill happen, of the retrospective jealousy of those who come after us, in\ncertain respects, we belong to the old humanity, the humanity that could\nstill regret paradise. But those who come after us will not even have the\nrecourse of that regret, they will not even have an idea of it, not even the\nword!\nMy vision of the future is so exact that if I had children, I should strangle\nthem here and now.\nWhen we think of the Berlin salons in the Romantic period, of the role\nplayed in them by a Henrietta Herz or a Rachel Levin, of the friendship\nbetween the latter and Crown Prince Louis-Ferdinand; and when we then\nthink that if such women had lived in this century they would have died in\nsome gas chamber, we cannot help considering the belief in progress as the\nfalsest and stupidest of superstitions.\nHesiod was the first to elaborate a philosophy of history. And also launched\nthe notion of decadence. By doing so, what a light he casts on historical\nprocess! If, at the very outset, in the heart of the post-Homeric world, he\ndecided that humanity was In its Iron age, what would he have said a few\ncenturies later—what would he say today?\nExcept in periods clouded over by frivolity or Utopia, man has always\nbelieved himself on the threshold of the worst. Knowing what he knew, by\nwhat miracle could he have unceasingly varied his desires and his terrors?\nWhen, just after the First World War, electricity was installed in the village\nwhere I was born, there was a general murmur of protest, then mute\ndesolation.

A\nsufficient reason to prefer the company of historians to that of philosophers.\nDuring his famous embassy to Rome in the second century b.c., Carneades\ntook advantage of the occasion to speak the first day in favor of the idea of\njustice, and on the following day against it. From that moment, philosophy,\nhitherto nonexistent in that country of healthy conduct, began to perpetrate\nits ravages. What is philosophy, then? The worm in the fruit….\nCato the Censor, who had been present at the Greek’s dialectical\nperformances, was alarmed by them and asked the Senate to satisfy the\nAthenian delegation as soon as possible, so harmful and even dangerous did\nhe consider their presence. Roman youth was not to frequent minds so\ndestructive.\nOn the moral level, Carneades and his companions were as formidable as\nthe Carthaginians on the military. Rising nations fear above all the absence\nof prejudices and prohibitions, the intellectual shamelessness which\nconstitutes the allure of declining civilizations.\nHercules was punished for having succeeded in all his undertakings.\nSimilarly Troy, too happy, had to perish.\n\f\nPondering this vision shared by the tragic poets, we cannot help thinking\nthat the so-called free world, upon which every fortune has been lavished,\nwill inevitably suffer Ilion’s fate, for the jealousy of the gods survives their\ndisappearance.\n“The French don’t want to work any more, they all want to write, my\nconcierge told me, unaware that she was then and there passing judgment\non all old civilizations.\nA society is doomed when it no longer has the force to be limited. How,\nwith an open mind—too open—can it protect itself against the excesses, the\nmortal risks of freedom?\nIdeological disputes reach the point of paroxysm only in countries where\nmen have fought each other over words, where they have gone to death for\nwords …, in the countries, in short, which have known wars of religion.\nA nation which has exhausted its mission is like an author who repeats\nhimself—no, who has nothing left to say. For to repeat yourself is to prove\nthat you still believe in yourself, and in what you have said. But a declining\nnation no longer has even the strength to mouth its old mottoes, which once\nhad assured it its preeminence and its pride.\nFrench has become a provincial language. The natives don’t mind. Only the\nforeigner is inconsolable on its account—he alone goes into mourning for\nNuance….\n\f\nThemistocles, by a unanimously approved decree, had the interpreter of\nXerxes’ ambassadors put to death “for having dared use the Greek language\nto express the orders of a barbarian.”\nA people commits such an act only at the peak of its career. It is\ndecadent, it is dying, when it no longer believes in its language, when it\nstops believing that its language is the supreme form of expression, the\nlanguage.\nA nineteenth-century philosopher maintained, In his innocence, that la\nRochefoucauld was right for the past, but that he would be invalidated by\nthe fixture. The Idea of progress dishonors the intellect.\nThe further man proceeds, the less he is in a position to solve his problems,\nand when, at the apex of his blindness, he will be convinced he is on the\npoint of success, then the unheard-of will occur.\nI would bestir myself, at best, for the Apocalypse, but for a revolution … To\ncollaborate with an ending or a genesis, an ultimate or initial calamity, yes,\nbut not with a change for some better or worse….\nWe have convictions only if we have studied nothing thoroughly.\nIn the long run, tolerance breeds more ills than intolerance. If this is true, it\nconstitutes the most serious accusation that can be made against man.\n\f\nOnce the animals no longer need to fear each other, they fall into a daze and\ntake on that dumbfounded look they have in zoos. Individuals and’ nations\nwould afford the same spectacle if some day they managed to live in\nharmony, no longer trembling openly or in secret.\nWith sufficient perspective, nothing is good or bad. The historian who\nventures to judge the past is writing journalism in another century.\nIn two hundred years (let us be precise!), the survivors of the overly\nfortunate nations will be put on reservations and visited, contemplated with\ndisgust, commiseration, or stupor, and with a malicious admiration as well.\nMonkeys living in groups reject, apparently, those which in some fashion\nhave consorted with humans. How one regrets that Swift never knew such a\ndetail!\nAre we to execrate our age—or all ages?\nDo we think of Buddha withdrawing from the world on account of his\ncontemporaries?\nIf humanity has such love for saviors, those fanatics who so shamelessly\nbelieve in themselves, it is because humanity supposes they believe in it.\n\f\nThe strength of this Statesman is to be visionary and cynical. A dreamer\nwithout scruples.\nThe worst crimes are committed out of enthusiasm, a morbid state\nresponsible for almost all public and private disasters.\nThe future appeals to you? All yours! Myself I prefer to keep to the\nincredible present and the incredible past. I leave it to you to face the\nIncredible itself.\n“You’re against everything that’s been done since the last war,” said the\nvery up-to-date lady.\n“You’ve got the wrong date: I’m against everything that’s been done\nsince Adam.”\nHitler is without a doubt the most sinister character in history. And the most\npathetic. He managed to achieve precisely the opposite of what he wanted,\nhe destroyed his ideal point by point. It is for this reason that he is a\nmonster in a class by himself—that is, a monster twice over, for even his\npathos is monstrous.\nAll great events have been set in motion by madmen, by mediocre madmen.\nWhich will be true, we may be sure, of the “end of the world” itself."

Having\nprepared their endeavors so far ahead, it is not astonishing that they should\npossess the earth: they conquered it before they were here …, an eternity\nago, and for all eternity, as a matter of fact.\nWhat distinguishes the true prophet from the rest is that he stands at the\norigin of movements and doctrines which exclude and oppose each other.\nIn a metropolis as in a hamlet, what we still love best is to watch the fall of\none of our kind.\nThe appetite for destruction is so deeply anchored within us that no one\nmanages to extirpate it. It belongs to our constitution, for the very basis of\nour being is demoniac.\nThe sage is a pacified, withdrawn destroyer. The others are destroyers in\npractice.\nMisfortune is a passive, endured state, while malediction supposes an\nelection à rebours, consequently a notion of mission, of inner power, which\nis not implied in misfortune. An accursed individual or nation necessarily\noutclasses an unfortunate individual or nation.\n\f\nStrictly speaking, history docs not repeat itself, but since the illusions man\nis capable of are limited in number, they always return in another disguise,\nthereby giving some ultradecrepit filth a look of novelty and a tragic glaze.\nI read some pages on Jovinian, Saint Basil, and several others. The conflict,\nduring the first centuries of Christianity, between orthodoxy and heresy\nseems no more insane than the one to which modern ideologies have\naccustomed us. The modalities of the controversy, the passions at work, the\nfollies and the absurdities, are almost identical. In both cases, everything\nturns on the unreal and the unverifiable, which form the very basis of either\nreligious or political dogmas. History would be tolerable only if we escaped\nboth kinds. True, it would then cease altogether, for the great good of\neveryone—those who endure it as well as those who make it.\nWhat makes destruction suspect is its facility: anyone who comes along can\nexcel in it. But if to destroy is easy, to destroy oneself is less so. Superiority\nof the outcast over the agitator or the anarchist.\nHad I lived in the early period of Christianity, I too, I fear, would have\nyielded to its seduction. And I hate that sympathizer, that hypothetical\nfanatic: I cannot forgive myself that conversion of two thousand years\nago….\nTom between violence and disillusionment, I seem to myself a terrorist\nwho, going out in the street to perpetrate some outrage, stops on the way to\nconsult Ecclesiastes or Epictetus.\n\f\nAccording to Hegel, man will be completely free only “by surrounding\nhimself with a world entirely created by himself.”\nBut this is precisely what he has done, and man has never been so\nenchained, so much a slave as now.\nLife would become endurable only among a humanity which would no\nlonger have any illusions in reserve, a humanity completely disabused and\ndelighted to be so.\nEverything I have been able to feel and to think coincides with an exercise\nin anti-utopia.\nMan will not last. Ambushed by exhaustion, he will have to pay for his too-\noriginal career. For it would be inconceivable and contra naturam that he\ndrag on much longer and come to a good end. This prospect is depressing,\nhence likely.\n“Enlightened despotism”: the only regime that can attract a disabused mind,\none incapable of being the accomplice of revolutions since it is not even the\naccomplice of history.\nNothing more painful than two contemporary prophets. One must withdraw,\nmust disappear if he is unwilling to expose himself to ridicule. Unless both\nare thus exposed, which would be the most equitable solution."

It is a very special disturbance we suffer in\nthe presence of someone there is no way of calling our kind.\nWherever civilized men appeared for the first time, they were regarded by\nthe natives as devils, as ghosts, specters. Never as living men! Unequaled\nintuition, a prophetic insight, if ever there was one.\nIf everyone had seen through everything, if everyone had “understood,”\nhistory would have ceased long since. But we are fundamentally,\nbiologically unsuited to “understand.” And even if everyone understood\nexcept for one, history would be perpetuated because of that one, because\nof his blindness. Because of a single illusion!\nX maintains we are at the end of a “cosmic cycle” and that soon everything\nwill fall apart. And he does not doubt this for one moment.\nAt the same time, he is the father of a—numerous—family. With\ncertitudes like his, what aberration has deluded him into bringing into a\ndoomed world one child after the next? If we foresee the End, if we are sure\nit will be coming soon, if we even anticipate it, better to do so alone. One\ndoes not procreate on Patmos.\nMontaigne, a sage, has had no posterity. Rousseau, an hysteric, still stirs\nnations. I like only the thinkers who have inspired no tribune of the people.\n\f\nIn 1441, the Council of Florence decreed that pagans, Jews, heretics, and\nschismatics will have no part in “eternal life” and that all, unless they\nembrace, before dying, the true religion, will go straight to hell.\nIn the days when the Church professed such enormities it was truly the\nChurch. An institution is vital and strong only if it rejects everything which\nis not itself. Unfortunately the same is true of a nation or of a regime.\nA serious, honest mind understands—and can understand—nothing of\nhistory. History in return is marvelously suited to delight an erudite cynic.\nExtraordinary pleasure at the thought that, being human, one is born under\nan accursed star, and that whatever one has undertaken and whatever one is\ngoing to undertake will be fondled by mischance.\nPlotinus befriended a Roman senator who had freed his slaves, renounced\nhis wealth, and who ate and slept at the houses of friends, for he no longer\nowned anything. This senator, from the “official” point of view, was\nderanged, and his case would be regarded as distressing, which indeed it\nwas: a saint in the Senate…. His presence, even his possibility—what an\nomen! The hordes were not far….\nA man who has completely vanquished selfishness, who retains no trace of\nit whatever, cannot live longer than twenty-one days, according to one\nmodern Vedantist school. No Western moralist, not even the grimmest,\nwould have dared venture an observation on human nature so startling, so\nrevealing.\n\f\nWe invoke “progress” less and less and “mutation” more and more, and all\nthat we allege to illustrate the latter’s advantages is merely one symptom\nafter another of an unrivaled catastrophe.\nWe can breathe—and brawl—only in a corrupt regime. But we realize as\nmuch only after having contributed to its destruction, and when nothing is\nleft but our capacity to regret it.\nWhat we call the creative instinct is merely a deviation, merely a perversion\nof our nature: we have not been brought into the world in order to innovate,\nto revolutionize, but to enjoy our semblance of being, in order to liquidate it\nquietly and to vanish afterward without a fuss.\nThe Aztecs were right to believe the gods must be appeased, to offer them\nhuman blood every day in order to keep the universe from sinking back into\nchaos.\nWe long since ceased to believe in the gods, and we no longer offer them\nsacrifices. Yet the world is still here. No doubt. Only we no longer have the\ngood luck to know why it does not collapse on the spot."

Our\nvery quest for salvation is a torment, the subtlest, the best camoulaged of all\nIf it is true that by death we once more become what we were before being,\nwould it not have been tetter to abide by that pure possibility, not to stir\nfrom it? What use was this detour, when we might have remained forever in\nan unrealized plenitude?\nOnce my body gives me the slip, how, I wonder, with such carrion on my\nhands, will I combat the capitulation of my organs?\nThe ancient gods ridiculed men, envied them, hunted them down on\noccasion, harried them. The God of the Gospels was less mocking and less\njealous, and mortal men did not even enjoy, in their miseries, the\nconsolation of being able to accuse Him. Which accounts for the absence or\nthe impossibility of a Christian Aeschylus. A good God has killed tragedy.\nZeus deserved differently of literature.\n\f\nHaunted, obsessed by abdication, as far back as I can remember. But\nabdication of what? If I once longed to be “someone,” it was only for the\nsatisfaction of someday being able to say, like Charles V at Yuste: “I am no\nlonger anything.”\nSome of the Provincial Letters were rewritten as many as seventeen times.\nAstounding that Pascal could have expended so much time and energy\nwhose interest seems minimal to us now. Every polemic dates—every\npolemic with men. In the Pensées, the debate was with God. This still\nconcerns us somewhat.\nSaint Seraphim of Sarov, in his fifteen years of complete seclusion, opened\nhis cell door to no one, not even to the bishop who occasionally visited the\nhermitage. “Silence,” he would say, “brings man closer to God and makes\nhim, on earth, like unto the angels.”\nWhat the saint should have added is that silence is never deeper than in\nthe impossibility of prayer….\nModern man has lost the sense of fate and thereby the savor of lamentation.\nIn the theater we should reinstate the chorus at once, and at funerals, the\nmourners….\nIn anxiety, a man clings to whatever can reinforce, can stimulate his\nprovidential discomfort: to try to cure him of it is to destroy his equilibrium,\nanxiety being the basis of his existence and his prosperity. The cunning\nconfessor knows it is necessary, knows that we cannot do without anxiety\nonce we have known it. Since he dares not proclaim its benefits, he employs\na detour—he vaunts remorse, an admitted, an honorable anxiety. His\n\f\ncustomers are grateful; hence he manages to keep them readily enough,\nwhereas his lay colleagues struggle and grovel to keep theirs.\nYou once told me death did not exist. Agreed, provided you add that\nnothing exists. To grant reality to anything and to deny it to what seems so\nmanifestly real is sheer extravagance.\nWhen we have committed the folly of confiding a secret to someone, the\nonly way of being sure he will keep it to himself is to kill him on the spot.\n“Sicknesses, some by day, others by night, in their fashion, visit men,\nbearing suffering to mortals—in silence, for wise Zeus has denied them\nspeech” (Hesiod).\nFortunately, for, being mute, they are already excruciating—what would\nthey be if they were garrulous as well? Can we imagine even one\nproclaiming itself? Instead of symptoms, declarations! Zeus, for once, has\nshown signs of delicacy.\nIn periods of sterility, one should hibernate, sleep day and night to preserve\none’s strength, instead of wasting it in mortification and rage.\nWe can admire someone only if he is three-quarters irresponsible—\nadmiration has nothing to do with respect.\n\f\nThe not at all negligible advantage of having greatly hated men is that one\ncomes to endure them by the exhaustion of this very hatred.\nOnce the shutters are closed, I stretch out in the dark. The outer world, a\nfading murmur, dissolves. All that is left is myself and … there’s the rub.\nHermits have spent their lives in dialogue with what was most hidden\nwithin them. If only, following their example, I could give myself up to that\nextreme exercise, in which one unites with the intimacy of one’s own being!\nIt is this self-interview, this inward transition which matters, and which has\nno value unless continually renewed, so that the self is finally absorbed by\nits essential version.\nEven in God’s company, discontent was brewing, as the revolt of the angels\ntestifies—the first on record. Apparently on every level of creation, no one\nis forgiven his superiority. We might even conceive of an envious flower.\nThe virtues have no face. Impersonal, abstract, conventional, they wear out\nfaster than the vices, which, more powerfully charged with vitality, define\nthemselves and become accentuated with age.\n“Everything is filled with gods,” said Thaïes, at the dawn of philosophy; at\nthe other end, at this twilight we have come to, we can proclaim, not only\nout of a need for symmetry but even more out of respect for the evidence,\nthat “everything is emptied of gods,” ‘\nI was alone in that cemetery overlooking the village when a pregnant\nwoman came in.

It emanates from a special\ndespondency, and lasts as long, even while the gods and their very memory\nmay vanish away forever.\n“No language can hope for anything but its own defeat” (Gregory Palamas).\nSo radical a condemnation of all literature could come only from a\nmystic—from a professional of the Inexpressible.\nIn Antiquity, one resorted readily, especially among the philosophers, to\nvoluntary asphyxia—one held one’s breath until … one died. So elegant\nand yet so practical a mode of being done with it has completely\ndisappeared, and it is anything but certain it can ever reappear.\nIt has been said and said again: the concept of destiny, which supposes\nchange, history, does not apply to an immutable being. Hence we cannot\nspeak of God’s “destiny.”\nDoubtless we cannot, in theory. In practice, we do nothing but,\nparticularly in the periods when beliefs are dissolving, when faith is shaky,\nwhen nothing seems able to withstand time, when God Himself is swept\ninto the general deliquescence.\nOnce we begin to want, we fall under the jurisdiction of the Devil."

    "raw_text": "Life is nothing; death, everything. Yet there is nothing which is death,\nindependent of life. It is precisely this absence of autonomous, distinct\nreality which makes death universal; it has no realm of its own, it is\nomnipresent, like everything which lacks identity, limit, and bearing: an\nindecent infinitude.\nEuphoria. Incapable of articulating my habitual moods and the reflections\nthey engender, impelled by some unknown power, I exulted without motive,\nand it is just such jubilation, of unknown origin, I reminded myself, which\nis the experience of those who do and strive, those who produce. They\nneither can nor will reflect on what denies them. And if they did, it would\nbe of no consequence, as was the case for me that memorable day.\nWhy embroider upon what excludes commentary? A text explained is no\nlonger a text. We live with an idea, we don’t dissect it; we struggle with it,\nwe don’t describe the stages of the conflict. The history of philosophy is the\nnegation of philosophy.\nA suspect scrapie led me to wonder exactly what it was by which I was\nfatigued, and I began drawing up the list: though incomplete, it appeared so\nlong, and so depressing, that I decided to fall back on fatigue in itself a\nflattering formula which, thanks to its philosophical ingredient, might\nrestore a plague victim.\nDestruction and explosion of syntax, victory of ambiguity and\napproximation. All very well. But just try to draw up a will, and you’ll see\nif the defunct rigor was so contemptible.\n\f\nAn aphorism? Fire without flames. Understandable that no one tries to\nwarm himself at it.\nEven if I were to lose my reason, I could never bring myself to that\n“uninterrupted prayer” advocated by the Hesychasts. All I understand about\npiety is its excesses, its suspect outrages, and askesis would not interest me\na moment if one did not encounter there all those things which are the lot of\nthe bad monk: indolence, gluttony, the thirst for desolation, greed, and\naversion for the world, vacillation between tragedy and the equivocal, hope\nof an inner collapse….\nI forget which Father recommends manual labor against acedia. Admirable\nadvice, which I have always followed spontaneously: no depression, that\nsecular acedia, can resist puttering.\nYears now without coffee, without alcohol, without tobacco, … Luckily,\nthere is anxiety, which usefully replaces the strongest stimulants.\nThe worst reproach to be made against police states is that they oblige—for\nprudence’s sake—the destruction of letters and diaries, i.e., what is least\nfalse in literature.\nTo keep the mind alert, slander turns out to be as effective as disease: the\nsame vigilance, the same fixed attention, the same insecurity, the same\nflagellating hysteria, the same mortal enrichment\n\f\nI am nothing, obviously, but since for so long I wanted to be something, I\nfail to smother that aspiration, that will: It exists because it has existed, it\nbelabors me and prevails, though I reject it. Try as I do to relegate it to my\npast, it kicks up again and torments me: never having been satisfied, it has\nmaintained itself Intact, and has no Intention of yielding to my orders.\nCaught between my will and myself, what can I do?\nIn bis Ladder of Paradise, Saint John Climacus notes that a proud monk has\nno need to be persecuted by the Devil—he is himself his own devil.\nI think of X, whose life in the monastery was a failure. No one was tetter\nconstituted to distinguish himself in the world and to shine there. Unsuited\nto humility, to obedience, he chose solitude and bogged down in it. There\nwas nothing in him to become, according to the same saint’s expression,\n“the lover of God.” Out of irony one can neither create one’s own salvation\nnor help others create theirs; one can merely disguise one’s wounds, if not\none’s distastes.\nIt is a great force, and a great fortune, to be able to live without any\nambition whatever. I aspire to it, but the very fact of so aspiring still\nparticipates in ambition.\nThe blank time of meditation is, in truth, the only “foil” time. We should\nnever blush to accumulate vacant moments—vacant in appearance, filled in\nfact. To meditate is a supreme leisure, whose secret has been lost.\nNoble gestures are always suspect. Each time, we regret having committed\nthem. Something false about them, something theatrical, attitudinizing. It is\n\f\ntrue that we regret ignoble gestures almost as much.\nIf I reflect on any moment of my life, the most feverish or the most neutral,\nwhat remains?—and what difference is there now between them?\nEverything having become the same, without relief and without reality, it is\nwhen I felt nothing that I was closest to the truth, I mean to my present state\nin which I am recapitulating my experiences. What is the use of having felt\nanything at all? There is no “ecstasy” which either memory or imagination\ncan resuscitate!\nNo one, before his last moment, manages to use up his death altogether:\neven for the born moribund, death has a touch of novelty.\nAccording to the Cabbala, God created souls at the beginning, and they\nwere all before him in the form they would later take in their incarnation.\nEach soul, when its time has come, receives the order to join the body\ndestined for it, but each to no avail implores its Creator to spare it this\nbondage and this corruption.\nThe more I think of what could not have failed to happen when my own\nsoul’s turn came, the more I realize that if there was one soul which more\nthan the rest must have resisted incarnation, it was mine.\nWe dismiss the skeptic, we speak of an “automatism of doubt,” while we\nnever say of a believer that he has fallen into an “automatism of faith.” Yet\nfaith is much more mechanical than doubt, which has the excuse of\nproceeding from surprise to surprise—inside perplexity, it is true.\n\f\nThat faint light in each of us which dates back to before our birth, to before\nall births, is what must be protected if we want to rejoin that remote glory\nfrom which we shall never know why we were separated.\nI have never known a single sensation of fulfillment, of true happiness,\nwithout thinking that it was the moment when—now or never—I should\ndisappear for good.\nA moment comes when it seems futile to have to choose between\nmetaphysics and amateurism, between the unfathomable and the anecdote.\nTo measure accurately the decline Christianity represents in relation to\npaganism, we need merely compare the pathetic remarks of the Church\nFathers on suicide with the opinions offered on the same subject by a Pliny,\na Seneca, and even a Cicero.\nWhat is the point of what we say? Is there any meaning to this series of\npropositions which constitutes our talk? And do these propositions, taken\none by one, have any object? We can talk only if we set aside this question,\nor if we raise it as infrequently as possible.\n“To hell with everything’—if these words have been uttered, even only\nonce, coldly, with complete awareness of what they mean, history is\njustified and, with it, all of us.\n\f\n“Woe unto you, when all men speak well of you!” Christ was here\nforetelling his own end. All men now speak well of him, even the most\nhardened unbelievers—they above all. Jesus knew perfectly well that he\nwould one day succumb to universal approbation.\nChristianity is lost if it does not suffer persecutions as pitiless as those it\nwas subjected to at its beginning. It must provoke enemies at all costs,\nprepare great calamities for itself. Only a new Nero might still be able to\nsave it.\nI believe speech to be a recent invention, and find it hard to imagine a\ndialogue that dates back beyond ten thousand years. And even harder, a\ndialogue that will occur in not ten thousand but even a thousand years from\nnow.\nIn a work of psychiatry, only the patients’ remarks interest me; in a work of\ncriticism, only the quotations.\nNo one can do anything for this Polish woman, who is beyond sickness and\nhealth, even beyond living and dying. A phantom cannot be cured, still less\nan enlightened mind. We can cure only those who belong to the earth and\nstill have their roots in it, however superficial.\nThe periods of sterility we pass through coincide with an exacerbation of\nour discernment—with the eclipse of the madman in us.\nTo proceed to the extremities of one’s art and, even further, of one’s being:\nsuch is the law of any man who regards himself to any degree as chosen.\n\f\nIt is because of speech that men give the illusion of being free. If they did—\nwithout a word—what they do, we would take them for robots. By\nspeaking, they deceive themselves, as they deceive others: because they say\nwhat they are going to do, who could suspect they are not masters of their\nactions?\nDeep inside, each man feels—and believes—himself to be immortal, even\nif he knows he will perish the next moment. We can understand everything,\nadmit everything, realize everything, except our death, even when we\nponder it unremittingly and even when we are resigned to it.\nIn the slaughterhouse that morning, I watched the cattle being led to their\ndeath. Almost every animal, at the last moment, refused to move forward.\nTo make them do so, a man hit them on the hind legs.\nThis scene often comes to mind when, ejected from sleep, I lack the\nstrength to confront the daily torture of Time.\nI pride myself on my capacity to perceive the transitory character of\neverything. An odd gift which has spoiled all my joys; better: all my\nsensations.\nEveryone expiates his first moment.\nFor an instant, I think I experienced what absorption into Brahma might\nsignify for an adept of the Vedanta. How much I longed for that instant to\n\f\nbe extensible—infinitely !\nI sought in doubt a remedy for anxiety. The remedy ended by making\ncommon cause with the disease.\n“If a doctrine spreads, it is because heaven has so desired” (Confucius).\n… As I should like to believe each time that, faced with some victorious\naberration, my rage borders on apoplexy.\nThe number of fanatics, extremists, and degenerates I have been able to\nadmire! A relief bordering on orgasm at the notion that one will never again\nembrace a cause, any cause …\nAn acrobat? An orchestra conductor caught up by the idea? He rushes in,\nthen calms down, alternates the allegro with the andante, a master of\nhimself like the fakirs or the swindlers. While he is talking, he seems to be\nseeking something, but one never knows what: an expert in the art of\ncounterfeiting the thinker. If he were to say a single thing that was perfectly\nclear, he would be lost. Since he is as ignorant as his hearers of what he\nwants to say or what he wants, he can go on for hours without exhausting\nthe amazement of the puppets listening to him.\nA privilege to live in conflict with one’s times. At every moment one is\naware one does not think like the others. This state of acute dissimilarity,\nhowever indigent or sterile it appears, nonetheless possesses a philosophical\nstatus which one would be at a loss to seek in cogitations attuned to events.\n\f\n“There’s no help for it,” the nonagenarian kept repeating to whatever I said,\nto whatever I shouted into her ear concerning the present, the future, the\nmarch of events….\nIn the hope of getting some other response from her, I went on with my\napprehensions, my grievances, my complaints. Obtaining only the\nsempiternal “No help for it,” I came to the end of my patience and left,\nirritated with myself, irritated with her. What folly, to confide in an idiot!\nOutside, complete reversal: “But the old woman’s right. How could I fail to\nrealize right away that her refrain had a truth in it, doubtless the most\nimportant truth of all, since everything that happens proclaims it and\neverything in ourselves rejects it?”\n\f\n10\nTwo kinds of intuitions: original (Homer, Upanishads, folklore) and belated\n(Mahayana Buddhism, Roman stoicism, Alexandrian gnosis). First flashes\nand fading glows. The wakening of consciousness and the lassitude of being\nawakened.\nIf it is true that what perishes has never existed, birth, source of the\nperishable, exists as little as the rest\nBeware of euphemisms! They aggravate the horror they are supposed to\ndisguise. To use, as the French do, “the disappeared” instead of the\ndeceased or the dead man, seems to me preposterous, even insane.\nWhen man forgets he is mortal, he feels inclined to do great things, and\nsometimes succeeds. This oblivion, fruit of excess, is at the same time the\ncause of his woes. “Mortal, think as a mortal.” Antiquity invented a tragic\nmodesty.\n\f\nOf all the equestrian statues of Roman emperors, the only one to survive the\nbarbarian invasions and the erosion of the ages is that of Marcus Aurelius—\nthe least “emperor” of all and the one who would have adapted himself to\nany other condition.\nGetting up with my head full of plans, I would be working, I was sure of it,\nall morning long. No sooner had I sat down at my desk than the odious,\nvile, and persuasive refrain: “What do you expect of this world?” stopped\nme short. And I returned, as usual, to my bed with the hope of finding some\nanswer, of going back to sleep. …\nWe make choices, decisions, as long as we keep to the surface of things;\nonce we reach the depths, we can neither choose nor decide, we can do\nnothing but regret the surface….\nThe fear of being deceived is the vulgar version of the quest for Truth.\nWhen you know yourself well and do not despise yourself utterly, it is\nbecause you are too exhausted to indulge in extreme feelings.\nIt is a withering process to follow a doctrine, a belief, a system—for a\nwriter especially; unless he lives, as often happens, in contradiction with the\nideas to which he appeals. This contradiction, or this treason, stimulates him\nand keeps him in a state of insecurity, embarrassment, shame—conditions\nfavorable to production.\n\f\nParadise was the place where everything was known but where nothing was\nexplained. The universe before sin—before commentary …\nI have no faith, luckily. If I had, I should live in constant fear of losing it.\nHence, far from helping me, it would do nothing but injure me.\nAn impostor, a “humbug,” conscious of being so and therefore a self-\nspectator, is necessarily more advanced in knowledge than a steady mind\n‘full of merits and all of a piece.\nAnyone possessing a body is entitled to be called a reprobate. If he is\nafflicted with a “soul” as well, there is no anathema to which he cannot lay\nclaim.\nHow are we to speak to someone who has lost everything? What language\nshall we use? The most diffuse, the vaguest, will always be the most\neffective.\nSupremacy of regret: the actions we have not performed constitute, by the\nvery fact that they pursue us and that we continually think about them, the\nsole contents of our consciousness.\nSometimes I wish I were a cannibal—less’for the pleasure of eating\nsomeone than for the pleasure of vomiting him.”\n\f\nNo longer wanting to be a man …, dreaming of another form of failure.\nEach time you find yourself at a turning-point, the best thing is to lie down\nand let the hours pass. Resolutions made standing up are worthless: they are\ndictated either by pride or by fear. Prone, we still know these two scourges,\nbut in a more attenuated, more intemporal form.\nWhen someone complains that his life has come to nothing, we need merely\nremind him that life itself is in an analogous situation, if not worse.\nWorks die: fragments, not having lived, cannot die either.\nHorror of the accessory paralyzes me. Now, the accessory is the essence of\ncommunication (and hence of thought), it is the flesh and blood of speech\nand writing. Trying to renounce it is like fornicating with a skeleton.\nThe satisfaction we take from performing a task (especially when we have\nno belief in the task and even disdain it) shows to what degree we still\nbelong to the rabble.\nMy merit is not to be totally ineffectual but to have wanted to be.\nIf I do not deny my origins, it is because it is ultimately better to be nothing\nat all than a pretense of something.\n\f\nA mixture of automatism and whim, man is a robot with defects, a robot out\nof order. If only he remains so, and is not some day put right!\nWhat every man, whether he has patience or not, has always expected is, of\ncourse, death. But he knows this only when death comes …, when it is too\nlate to be able to enjoy it.\nMan certainly began praying long before he knew how to speak, for the\npangs he must have suffered upon leaving animality, upon denying it, could\nnot have been endured without grunts and groans, préfigurations,\npremonitory signs of prayer.\nIn art and in everything, the commentator is generally better informed and\nmore lucid than the subject of commentary. This is the advantage the\nmurderer has over his victim.\n“Let us offer our thanks to the gods, who keep no one in this life by force.”\nSeneca (whose style, according to Caligula, lacks cement) is open to the\nessential, and this not so much because of his affiliation with stoicism as\nbecause of his eight-years’ exile in Corsica, particularly desolate at the time.\nThis ordeal conferred upon a frivolous writer a dimension he would not\nhave acquired in the normal course of events; it relieved him of the aid of a\nsickness.\n\f\nMine still, this moment passes by, escapes me, and is buried forever. Am I\ngoing to commit myself with the next? I make up my mind: it is here, it\nbelongs to me—and already is long since past. From morning to night,\nfabricating the past!\nAfter having, to no avail, tried everything among the mystics, he had only\none recourse: to founder in wisdom….\nOnce you ask yourself so-called philosophical questions and employ the\ninevitable jargon, you assume a superior, aggressive manner, and this in a\nrealm where, the insoluble being de rigueur, humility should be also. This\nanomaly is merely apparent: the more formidable the questions you\nconfront, the more you lose your head: ultimately you bestow on yourself\nthe dimensions they possess. If the pride of theologians “stinks” even more\nthan that’of the philosophers, it is because one decs not concern oneself\nwith God with impunity: one reaches the point of arrogating to oneself\ncertain of His attributes—the worst, of course.\nAt peace with itself and the world, the mind atrophies. It flourishes at the\nslightest contrariety. Thought is really no more than the shameless\nexploitation of our embarrassments and our disgraces.\nThis body, once loyal, disavows me, no longer follows me, has ceased to be\nmy accomplice. Rejected, betrayed, discarded, what would become of me if\nold infirmities, to prove their allegiance, didn’t come to keep me company\nat every hour of the day and night?\n\f\n“Distinguished” people do not invent in matters of language. On the\ncontrary, the ones who excel there are those who improvise out of\nboastfulness or who wallow in a sentimental coarseness. Such men are\n“natures,” they live on the level of words. Is verbal genius, then, the\nconcomitant of low haunts? In any case, it requires a certain minimum of\nodium.\nWe should keep to a single language, and deepen our knowledge of it at\nevery opportunity. For a writer, gossiping with a concierge in his own is\nmuch more profitable than arguing with a scholar in a foreign tongue.\n“… the feeling of being everything and the evidence of being nothing.” I\nhappened across this phrase in my youth, and was overwhelmed by it.\nEverything I felt in those days, and everything I would feel from then on,\nwas summed up in this eitraordinary banal formula, the synthesis of\nexpansion and failure, ecstasy and impasse. Most often it is not in a paradox\nbut in a truism that a revelation appears.\nPoetry excludes calculation and premeditation: it is incompletion,\nforeboding, abyss. Neither a singsong geometry, nor a succession of\nbloodless adjectives. We are too deeply wounded and too despondent, too\nweary and too barbarous in our weariness, to appreciate, yet, the craft.\nWe cannot do without the notion of progress, yet it does not deserve our\nattention. It is like the “meaning” of life. Life must have one. But is there\nany which does not turn out, upon examination, to be ludicrous?\n\f\nTrees are massacred, houses go up—faces, faces everywhere. Man is\nspreading. Man is the cancer of the earth.\nThere is something enveloping and voluptuous about the notion of fatality:\nit keeps you warm.\nA troglodyte that will have passed through all the nuances of satiety….\nThe pleasure of slandering yourself greatly exceeds that of being slandered.\nBetter than anyone I know the danger of being born with a thirst for\neverything. A poisoned gift, a vengeance of Providence. Thus encumbered,\nI could get nowhere, on the spiritual level, of course, the only one that\nmatters. Anything but accidental, my failure is identified with my essence.\nThe mystics and their “collected works.” When one addresses oneself to\nGod, and to God alone, as they claim to do, one should be careful not to\nwrite. God doesn’t read….\nEach time I think of the Essential, I seem to glimpse it in silence or\nexplosion, in stupor or exclamation. Never in speech.\nWhen you meditate all day on the inopportuneness of birth, everything you\nplan and everything you perform seems pathetic, futile. You are like a\n\f\nmadman who, cured, does nothing but think of the crisis from which he has\nemerged, the “dream” he has left behind; he keeps harking back to it, so that\nhis cure is of no benefit to him whatever.\nThe appetite for torment is for some what the lure of gain is for others.\nMan started out on the wrong foot. The misadventure in Paradise was the\nfirst consequence. The rest had to follow.\nI shall never understand how we can live knowing that we are not—to say\nthe least!—eternal.\nThe ideal being? An angel ravaged by humor.\nWhen, after a series of questions about desire, disgust, and serenity, Buddha\nwas asked: “What is the goal, the final meaning of nirvana?” he did not\nanswer. He smiled. There has been a great deal of commentary on that\nsmile, instead of seeing it as a normal reaction to a pointless question. It is\nwhat we do when confronted by a child’s why. We smile, because no answer\nis conceivable, because the answer would be even more meaningless than\nthe question. Children admit no limits to anything; they always want to see\nbeyond, to see what there is afterward. But there is no afterward. Nirvana is\na limit, the limit It is Iteration, supreme impasse….\nExistence might well have had some attraction before the advent of noise—\nlet us say, before the neolithic age. When will he come, the man who can rid\n\f\nus of all men?\nFor all we tell ourselves’ about not outliving a stillborn babe, instead of\nclearing out at the first opportunity, we cling, with lunatic energy, to one\nday more.\nLucidity docs not extirpate the desire to live—far from it, lucidity merely\nmakes us unsuited to life.\nGod: a disease we imagine we are cured of because no one dies of it\nnowadays.\nUnconsciousness is the secret, the “vital principle” of life…. It is the sole\nrecourse against the self, against the disease of being individualized, against\nthe debilitating effect of the state of consciousness, a state so formidable, so\ndemanding, that it must be reserved for athletes alone.\nAny success, in any realm, involves an inner impoverishment It makes us\nforget what we are, it deprives us of the torment of our limits.\nI have never taken myself for a being. A non-citizen, a marginal type, a\nnothing who exists only by the excess, by the superabundance of his\nnothingness."

Suffering\nimproves no one (except those who were already good), it is forgotten as all\nthings are forgotten, it does not enter into “humanity’s patrimony” nor\npreserve itself in any way at all—it wastes itself as everything is wasted.\nOnce again, it serves only to open our eyes.\nMan has said what he had to say.

    "raw_text": "With the passage of time, I am convinced that my first years were a\nparadise. But I am undoubtedly mistaken. If there was ever a paradise, I\nmust look for it earlier than all my years.\nA golden rule: to leave an incomplete image of oneself …\nThe more man is man, the more he loses in reality: it is the price he must\npay for his distinct essence. If he managed to achieve the limits of his\nsingularity, if he were to become man totally, absolutely, there would no\nlonger be anything in him which would suggest any kind of existence at all.\nSilence in the face of the decrees of fate, the rediscovery, after centuries of\nthundering prayer, of the ancient Be still—there is our aspiration, there our\nstruggle, if such a word is appropriate to a foreseen and accepted defeat.\nEvery success is ignominious; we never get over it—in our own eyes, of\ncourse.\nThe pangs of truth about ourselves are more than we can endure. How\npitiable the man (if such a being exists) who no longer lies to himself!\nI shall no longer read the sages—they have done me too much harm. I\nshould have surrendered to my instincts, let my madness flourish. I have\ndone just the opposite, I have put on the mask of reason, and the mask has\nended by replacing my face and usurping all the rest.\n\f\nIn my moments of megalomania, I tell myself that it is impossible my\ndiagnoses should be mistaken, that I have only to be patient, to wait until\nthe end, until the advent of the last man, the one being in a position to\nsubstantiate me….\nThe notion that it would have been better never to exist is among those\nwhich meet with the most opposition. Every man, incapable of seeing\nhimself except from inside, regards himself as necessary, even\nindispensable, every man feels and perceives himself as an absolute reality,\nas a whole, as the whole. The moment we identify ourselves entirely with\nour own being, we react like God, we are God.\nIt is only when we live at once within and on the margins of ourselves that\nwe can conceive, quite calmly, that it would have been preferable that the\naccident we are should never have occurred.\nIf I followed my natural inclination, I should blow up the world. And it is\nbecause I lack the courage to follow it that, out of penitence, I try to stupefy\nmyself with the company of those who have found peace.\nA writer has left his mark on us not because we have read him a great deal\nbut because we have thought of him more than is warranted. I have not\nfrequented Baudelaire or Pascal particularly, but I have not stopped thinking\nof their miseries, which have accompanied me everywhere as faithfully as\nmy own.\nAt each age, more or less distinct signs warn us that it is time to decamp.\nWe hesitate, we procrastinate, convinced that, once old age has come at last,\nthese signs will become so clear that any further vacillation would be\n\f\nunsuitable. Clear they are, indeed, but we lack sufficient vigor to perform\nthe one decent action a living man can commit.\nOur physiological miseries help us to envisage the future with some\nconfidence: they dispense us from tormenting ourselves overmuch, they do\ntheir test so that none of our long-range projects has time to wear out all our\navailable energies.\nThe Empire was falling, the Barbarians were on the move…. What was to\nbe done, except to escape the age? Happy moment, when there was still\nsomewhere to go, when the empty places were accessible and welcoming!\nWe have been dispossessed of everything, even the desert.\nFor the man who has got in the nasty habit of unmasking appearances, event\nand misunderstanding are synonyms. To make for the essential is to throw\nup the game, to admit one is defeated.\nX is undoubtedly right to compare himself to a “volcano,” but wrong to go\ninto details.\nThe poor, by thinking unceasingly of money, reach the point of losing the\nspiritual advantages of non-possession, thereby sinking as low as the rich.\nThe early Greeks regarded the psyche as no more than air, wind, or at test\nsmoke, and one readily agrees with them every time one wearies of\n\f\nforaging in one’s own ego or that of others, searching for strange and, if\npossible, suspect depths.\nThe final step toward indifference is the destruction of the very notion of\nindifference.\nWalking in a forest between two hedges of ferns transfigured by autumn—\nthat is a triumph. What are ovations and applause beside it?\nTo deprecate your own kind, to vilify and pulverize them, to attack their\nfoundations, to undermine your very basis, to destroy your point of\ndeparture, to punish your origins …, to curse all those non-elect, lesser\nbreeds, torn between imposture and elegy, whose sole mission is not to have\none …\nHaving destroyed all my connections, burned my bridges, I should feel a\ncertain freedom, and in fact I do, one so intense I am afraid to rejoice in it.\nWhen the habit of seeing things as they are turns into a mania, we lament\nthe madman we have been and are no longer.\n\f\n11\nSomeone we regard highly comes closer to us when he performs an action\nunworthy of him—thereby he releases us from the calvary of veneration.\nAnd starting from that moment we feel a true attachment to him.\nNothing is worse than the coarseness and meanness we perpetrate out of\ntimidity.\nFaced with the Nile and the Pyramids, Flaubert thought of nothing but\nNormandy, according to one witness—nothing but the landscapes and\nmanners of the future Madame Bovary. Nothing but that seemed to exist for\nhim. To imagine is to limit oneself, to exclude: without an excessive\ncapacity for rejection, no plan, no work, no way of realizing anything.\nWhat in any way resembles a victory seems to me so dishonorable that i can\ndo battle, in whatever circumstance, only with the firm intention of gaining\nthe under hand. I have passed the stage where beings matter, and I see no\nreason to struggle in known worlds."

    "raw_text": "Philosophy is taught only in the agora, in a garden, or at home. The lecture\nchair is the grave of philosophy, the death of any living thought, the dais is\nthe mind in mourning.\nThat I can still desire proves that I lack an exact perception of reality, that I\nam distracted, that I am a thousand miles from the Truth. “Man,” we read in\nthe Dhammapada, “is prey to desire only because he does not see things as\nthey are.”\nI was shaking with rage: my honor was at stake. The hours passed, dawn\nwas approaching. Was I going to ruin my night because of a trifle? Try as I\nwould to minimize the incident, the reasons I invented to calm myself\nremained ineffectual. That anyone would dare do such a thing to me! I was\non the point of opening the window and screaming like a madman, when\nthe image of our planet spinning like a top suddenly seized my mind. My\nanger subsided at once.\nDeath is not altogether useless: after all, it is because of death that we may\nbe able to recuperate the prenatal space, our only space….\nHow right it was to begin the day, as men once did, with a prayer, a call for\nhelp! Ignorant of whom to address ourselves to, we will end by groveling\nbefore the first cracked god to come along.\nAcute consciousness of having a body—that is the absence of health….\nWhich is as much as to say that I have never been well\n\f\nEverything is deception—I’ve always known that Yet this certitude has\nafforded me no relief, except at the moments when it was violently present\nto my mind….\nThe perception of the Precarious raised to the level of vision, of mystical\nexperience.\nThe only way of enduring one disaster after the next is to love the very idea\nof disaster: if we succeed, there are no further surprises, we are superior to\nwhatever occurs, we are invincible victims.\nIn very powerful sensations of pain, much more than in very slight ones, we\nobserve ourselves, we divide into an external witness and the moaning,\nscreaming sufferer. Everything which borders on torment wakens the\npsychologist in each of us, as well as the experimenter: we want to see how\nfer we can go in the intolerable.\nWhat is injustice compared to disease? True, we may find it unjust to be\nsick. Moreover that is how each of us reacts, without troubling as to\nwhether he is right or wrong. Sickness is: nothing more real than disease. If\nwe call it unjust, we must dare to do as much with Being itself—we must\nspeak, then, of the injustice of existing.\nThe Creation, as it was, amounted to little enough; tinkered with, it was\nworth still less. If only it had teen left to Its truth, Its primal nullity! The\n\f\nMessiah to come—the real one—is understandably slow about putting in an\nappearance. The task that awaits him is not going to te an easy one: how\nwill he manage to deliver humanity from the mania of amelioration?\nWhen, getting too used to ourselves, we begin to loathe ourselves, we soon\nrealize that we are worse off, that self hatred actually strengthens self\nattachment\nI do not interrupt him, I let him weigh each man’s merits, waiting for him to\ntell me off…. His Incomprehension of others is astounding. Subtle and\ningenuous both, he judges you as if you were an entity or a category. Time\nhaving had no hold over him, he cannot admit that I am outside of whatever\nhe forbids, that nothing of what he favors still concerns me. Dialogue\nbecomes pointless with someone who escapes the procession of the years. I\nask those I love to be kind enough to grow old.\nPanic in the face of anything—of presence, of the void, of anything.\nOriginal panic.\nGod is, even if He isn’t.\nD is incapable of assimilating Evil. He acknowledges its existence, but\ncannot incorporate it into his mind. If he were to emerge from hell he would\nbe oblivious of his whereabouts, so remote is he in his thinking from what\nfalls afoul…. Not the faintest trace of all he has endured in his ideas.\nOccasionally he has reflexes—no more than that—the reflexes of a\nwounded man. Closed to the negative, he does not discern that all we\n\f\npossess is merely a capital of non-being. Yet more than one of his gestures\nreveals a demonic spirit—demonic unawares. He is a destroyer obscured\nand sterilized by Good.\nCuriosity to measure our progress into failure is the only reason we have to\ngrow older. Wc thought we had reached the limit, we thought the horizon\nwas blocked forever, we lamented in the thrall of our discouragement And\nnow we realize that we can fall still lower, that there is something new, that\nall hope is not lost, that it is possible to sink a little further and thus to\npostpone the danger of getting stuck, even paralyzed….\n“Life seems good only to the madman,” observed Hegesias, a Cyrcnaic\nphilosopher, some twenty-three centuries ago. These are almost the only\nwords of his we have…. Of all oeuvres to reinvent, his comes first on my\nlist.\nNo one approaches the condition of a sage if he has not had the good luck\nto be forgotten in his lifetime.\nTo think is to undermine—to undermine oneself. Action involves fewer\nrisks, for it fills the interval between things and ourselves, whereas\nreflection dangerously widens it.\n… So long as I give myself up to physical exercise, manual labor, I am\nhappy, fulfilled; once I stop, I am seized by dizziness, and I can think of\nnothing but giving up for good.\n\f\nAt the lowest point of ourselves, when we touch bottom and feel the abyss,\nwe are suddenly raised up—defense-reaction or absurd pride—by the sense\nof being superior to God. The grandiose and impure aspect of the\ntemptation to be done with it all.\nA broadcast about wolves, with recordings of their howls. What a language!\nThe most heartrending I know, and I shall never forget it. From now on, in\nmoments of excessive solitude, I need merely recall those sounds to have\nthe sense of belonging to a community.\nFrom the moment defeat was in sight, Hitler spoke of nothing but victory.\nHe believed in it—he behaved, in any case, as if he believed in it—and\nremained to the end walled up in his optimism, his faith. Everything was\ncrumbling around him, every day belied his hopes but, persisting in his trust\nin the impossible, blinding himself as only the incurable can, he had the\nstrength to go on to the end, to invent one horror after the next, and to\ncontinue beyond his madness, even beyond his destiny. Which is why we\ncan say of him—of the man who failed so utterly—that he realized himself\nbetter than any other mortal.\n“Aprà moi le déluge” is the unavowed motto of every person: if we admit\nthat others survive us, it is in the hope that they will be punished for it.\nA zoologist who observed gorillas in their native habitat was amazed by the\nuniformity of their life and their vast idleness. Hours and hours without\ndoing anything … Was boredom unknown to them?\nThis is indeed a question raised by a human, a busy ape. Far from fleeing\nmonotony, animals crave it, and what they most dread is to see it end. For it\nends only to be replaced by fear, the cause of all activity.\n\f\nInaction is divine; yet it is against inaction that man has rebelled. Man\nalone, in nature, is incapable of enduring monotony, man alone wants\nsomething to happen at all costs—something, anything…. Thereby he\nshows himself unworthy of his ancestor: the need for novelty is the\ncharacteristic of an alienated gorilla.\nWe come closer and closer to the Unbreathable. When we have reached it,\nthat will be the great Day. Alas, we are only on the eve. …\nA nation achieves and retains pre-eminence as long as it accepts\nconventions which are necessarily clumsy, as long as it is given over to\nprejudices without regarding them as such. Once it calls them by their\nname, everything is unmasked, everything is compromised.\nTo seek to rule, to take a role, to make the law—such things cannot be\ndone without a powerful dose of stupidity: history, in its essence, is stupid.\n… It continues, it advances, because the nations liquidate their prejudices\none after the other. If they were to be rid of them all at the same time, there\nwould be nothing left but a blessed universal disintegration.\nOne cannot live without motives. I have no motives left, and I am living.\nI was in perfect health, I felt better than ever. Suddenly I was cold, so cold\nthat I was sure there was no cure for it. What was happening to me? Yet this\nwas not the first time I had been in the grip of such a sensation. But in the\npast I had endured it without trying to understand. This time I wanted to\nknow, and now. … I abandoned one hypothesis after the next: it could not\nbe sickness; not the shadow of a symptom to cling to. What was I to do? I\nwas baffled, incapable of finding even the trace of an explanation, when an\nidea occurred to me—and this was a real relief—that what I was feeling\n\f\nwas merely a version of the great, final cold—that it was simply death\nexercising, rehearsing….\nIn paradise, objects and beings, assaulted by light from all sides, cast no\nshadow. Which is to say that they lack reality, like anything that is\nunbroached by darkness and deserted by death.\nOur first intuitions are the true ones. What I thought of so many things in\nmy first youth seems to me Increasingly right, and after so many detours\nand distractions, I now come back to it, aggrieved that I could have erected\nmy existence on the ruin of those revelations.\nI remember a place I have been only if I have had the luck to experience\nutter misery there.\nAt the street fair, watching a tumbler grimacing, shouting, exhausting\nhimself, I told myself that he was doing his duty, whereas I was evading\nmine….\nTo manifest oneself, to produce in any realm is the characteristic of a more\nor less camouflaged fanatic. If we do not regard ourselves as entrusted with\na mission, existence is difficult; action, impossible.\nThe certitude that there is no salvation is a form of salvation, in fact it is\nsalvation. Starting from here, we might organize our own life as well as\n\f\nconstruct a philosophy of history: the insoluble as solution, as the only way\nout….\nMy weaknesses have spoiled my existence, but it is thanks to them that I\nexist, that I imagine I exist.\nMan interests me only since he has ceased to believe in himself. While he\nwas in his ascending phase, he deserved no more than indifference. Now he\nprovokes a new sentiment, a special sympathy: compassionate horror.\nFor all the superstitions and shackles I have rid myself of, I cannot regard\nmyself as a free man, remote from everything. A mania for desistance,\nhaving survived the other passions, refuses to leave me: it torments me, it\nperseveres, it demands that I continue renouncing, withdrawing. But from\nwhat? What is left to reject? I ponder the question. My role is over, my\ncareer finished, and yet nothing has changed in my life, I am at the same\npoint in it, I must still desist, still and forever."

It warrants them, it is their way of winning. On the other hand, for\nthe others, those who have labored to succeed, and who have succeeded:\nwhat a denial, what a slap in the face!\nAn Egyptian monk, after fifteen years of complete solitude, received a\npacket of letters from his family and friends. He did not open them, he\nflung them into the fire in order to escape the assault of memory. We cannot\nsustain communion with oursclf and our thoughts if we allow ghosts to\n\f\nappear, to prevail. The desert signifies not so much a new life as the death\nof the past: at last we have escaped our own history. In society, no less than\nin the Thebaid, the letters we write, and those we receive, testify to the fact\nthat we are in chains, that we have broken none of the bonds, that we are\nmerely slaves and deserve to be so.\nA little patience and the moment will come when nothing more will be\npossible, when humanity, thrown back on itself, cannot take a single step in\nany direction. Though we may manage a general sense of this\nunprecedented spectacle, we should like details. … And we are afraid we\nwill miss the festivities, not being young enough to have the luck to attend.\nWhether it is spoken by a grocer or a philosopher, the word being,\napparently so rich, so tempting, so charged with significance, in fact means\nnothing at all; incredible that a man in his right mind can use it on any\noccasion whatever.\nGetting up in the middle of the night, I walked around my room with the\ncertainty of being chosen and criminal, a double privilege natural to the\nsleepless, revolting or incomprehensible for the captives of daytime logic.\nIt is not given to everyone to have had an unhappy childhood. Mine was\nmuch more than happy—it was crowned. I cannot find a better adjective to\ndesignate what was triumphant about even its pangs. That had to be paid\nfor, that could not go unpunished.\n\f\nIf I am so fond of Dostoevsky’s correspondence, It Is because he speaks in\nit of nothing but sickness and money, the only “burning” subjects. All the\nrest is merely flourishes and chaff.\nIn five hundred thousand years, it appears that England will be entirely\nsubmerged. If I were an Englishman I should lay down my arms at once.\nEach of us has his unit of time. For one it is the day, the week, the month,\nor the year; for another, it is a decade, or a century…. These units, still on\nthe human scale, are compatible with any plan, any task.\nThere are some, however, who take time itself for their unit, and\nsometimes raise themselves above it: for them, what task, what plan\ndeserves to be taken seriously? A man who sees too far, who is\ncontemporary with the whole future, can no longer act or even move….\nAn obsession with the precarious accompanies me in every circumstance:\nmailing a letter this morning, I told myself it was addressed to a mortal.\nOne absolute experience, apropos of anything, and you seem, in your own\neyes, a survivor.\nI have always lived with the awareness of the impossibility of living. And\nwhat has made existence endurable to me is my curiosity as to howl would\nget from one minute, one day, one year to the next.\nThe first condition for becoming a saint is to love bores, to endure visits….\n\f\nTo shake people up, to wake them from their sleep, while knowing you are\ncommitting a crime and that it would te a thousand times tetter to leave\nthem alone, since when they wake, too, you have nothing to offer them….\nPort-Royal. In that green vale, so many conflicts and lacerations on account\nof a few bagatelles! Any belief, after a certain time, seems gratuitous and\nincomprehensible, as does the counter-belief which has destroyed it. Only\nthe stupefaction which both provoke remains.\nA poor wretch who feels time, who is its victim, its martyr, who experiences\nnothing else, who is time at each moment, knows what a metaphysician or a\npoet divines only by grace of a collapse or a miracle.\nThose inner rumblings which come to nothing, and by which we are\nreduced to the state of a grotesque volcano.\nEach time I am gripped by a fit of rage, I begin by being aggrieved and\ndisgusted, then I teil myself: what luck, what a windfall! I am still alive, I\nam still one of those flesh-and-blood ghosts, …\nThere was no end to the telegram I had just received. All my pretentions, all\nmy inadequacies were in it. Certain failings I myself scarcely suspected\nwere revealed, were proclaimed! What prescience, and what detail! At the\nend of the interminable indictment, no clue, no trace that permitted me to\nidentify the sender. Who could it be? And why this haste, this unaccustomed\nmeans of communication? Who ever spoke his mind with such rigor in his\ngrievance? Where did he come from, this omniscient judge who dared not\n\f\nname himself, this coward in possession of all my secrets, this inquisitor\nwho allowed no extenuating circumstances, not even the ones granted by\nthe most hardened torturers? I too might have made a misstep or two, I too\nam entitled to some indulgence. I cringe before the inventory of my defects,\nI choke, I cannot bear this procession of truths…. Cursed telegram—I tear it\nup, and awaken….\nTo have opinions is inevitable, is natural; to have convictions is less so.\nEach time I meet someone who has convictions, I wonder what intellectual\nvice, what flaw has caused him to acquire such a thing. However legitimate\nthis question, my habit of raising it spoils the pleasure of conversation for\nme, gives me a bad conscience, makes me hateful in my own eyes.\nOnce upon a time writing seemed important to me. Of all my superstitions,\nthis one seems the most compromising and the most incomprehensible.\nI have abused the word disgust. But what other can I use to indicate a state\nin which exasperation is continually corrected by lassitude, and lassitude by\nexasperation?\nAll evening, having tried to define him, we reviewed all the euphemisms\nwhich allow us not to pronounce, in his regard, the word perfidy. He is not\nperfidious, he is merely tortuous, diabolically tortuous, and at the same time\ninnocent, naïve, even angelic. Imagine, if you can, a mixture of Aliosha and\nSmerdyakov.\n\f\nWhen you no longer believe in yourself, you stop producing or struggling,\nyou even stop raising questions or answering them, whereas it is the\ncontrary which should have occurred, since it is precisely at this moment\nthat, being free of all bonds, you are likely to grasp the truth, discern what\nis real and what is not. But once your belief in your own role, or your own\nlot, has dried up, you become incurious about everything else, even the\n“truth,” though you are closer to it than ever before.\nIn Paradise, I would not last a “season” or even a day; then how account for\nmy nostalgia for it? I don’t account for it, it has inhabited me always, it was\npart of me before I was.\nAnyone may now and then have the sense of occupying only a point and a\nmoment; to have such a sense day and night, hour by hour, is less frequent,\nand it is from this experience, this datum, that one turns toward nirvana or\nsarcasm—or toward both at once.\nAlthough I have sworn never to sin against blessed concision, I am still in\ncomplicity with words, and if I am seduced by silence I dare not enter it, I\nmerely prowl on its peripheries.\nWe should establish a religion’s degree of truth according to what it makes\nof the Devil: the more eminent the rank it accords him, the more it testifies\nthat it is concerned with reality, that it rejects deceit and lies, that it is\nserious, that it sets more store by verification than by distraction or\nconsolation."

    "raw_text": "Nothing deserves to be undone, doubtless because nothing deserved to be\ndone. Hence we become detached from everything, from the original as\nwell as from the ultimate, from advent as well as from collapse.\nWe know, we feel that everything has been said, that there is nothing left to\nsay. But we feel less that this truth affords language a strange, even\nunsettling status which redeems it. Words are ultimately saved because they\nhave ceased living.\nThe enormous good and the enormous harm I have drawn from my\nruminations on the’condition of the dead.\nThe undeniable advantage of growing old is to be able to observe at close\nrange the slow and methodical degradation of our organs; they are all\nbeginning to go, some obviously, others discreetly. They become detached\nfrom the body, as the body becomes detached from us: it escapes us, flees\nus, no longer belongs to us. It is a traitor we cannot even denounce, since it\nstops nowhere and puts itself in no one’s service.\nI never tire of reading about the hermits, preferably about those said to be\n“weary of seeking God.” I am dazzled by the failures of the Desert.\nIf, somehow, Rimbaud had been able to go on (as likely as imagining the\nday after the apocalypse, or a Nietzsche scribbling away after Ecce Homo),\nhe would have ended by reining in, calming down, by glossing his own\nexplosions, explicating them—and himself. A sacrilege in every case,\nexcess of consciousness being only a form of profanation.\n\f\nI have followed only one idea all the way—the idea that everything man\nachieves necessarily turns against him. The idea is not a new one, but I have\nlived it with a power of conviction, a desperation which no fanaticism, no\ndelirium has ever approached. There is no martyrdom, no dishonor I would\nnot suffer for it, and I would exchange it for no other truth, no other\nrevelation.\nTo go still further than Buddha, to raise oneself above nirvana, to learn to\ndo without it …, to be stopped by nothing, not even by the notion of\ndeliverance, regarding it as a mere way-station, an embarrassment, an\neclipse …\nMy weakness for doomed dynasties, for decaying empires, for the\nMontezumas of forever, for those who believe in signs, for the lacerated and\npursued, for the drunkards of the ineluctable, for the jeopardized, the\ndevoured, for all who are waiting for their executioner …\nI pass without stopping at the grave of that critic whose vitriolic remarks I\nhave so often pondered. Nor at the grave of the poet who spent his life\ndreaming of his ultimate dissolution. Other names pursue me, alien names\nlinked to a pitiless and pacifying wisdom, to a vision calculated to free the\nmind from all obsessions, even funereal ones. Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti,\nSantideva—unparalleled swashbucklers, dialecticians belabored by the\nobsession of salvation, acrobats and apostles of Vacuity for whom, sages\namong the sages, the universe was only a word….\n\f\nNo matter how many autumns I observe the spectacle of these leaves so\neager to fall, it still surprises me each time—a surprise in which “a chill\ndown the spine” would prevail were it not for the last-minute explosion of a\ngaiety whose origin I cannot account for.\nThere are certain moments when, remote as we are from any faith, we can\nconceive of only God as our interlocutor. To address ourselves elsewhere\nseems an impossibility, a madness. Solitude, in its extreme reaches, requires\na form of conversation, also extreme.\nMan gives off a special odor: of all the animals, he alone smells of the\ncorpse.\nThe hours would not pass; dawn seemed remote, inconceivable. Actually it\nwas not dawn I was waiting for but oblivion of those refractory hours which\nrefused to stir. Lucky the man condemned to death, I told myself, who on\nthe eve of his execution is at least sure of having one good night!\nWill I be able to stand another minute? will I collapse? If there is one\ninteresting sensation, it is the one which gives us the foretaste of epilepsy.\nA man who survives himself despises himself without acknowledging as\nmuch, sometimes without even knowing as much.\nWhen you live past the age of rebellion, and you still rebel, you seem to\nyourself a kind of senile Lucifer.\n\f\nIf we did not tear the stigmata of life, how easy it would be to steal away,\nand how well everything would go by itself!\nBetter than anyone I am able to forgive on the spot. My desire for revenge\ncomes late, too late, when memory of the offense is fading and when, the\nincitation to action having become virtually nonexistent, I have only one\nrecourse: to deplore my “good feelings.”\nOnly to the degree that our moments afford us some contact with death do\nwe have some chance to glimpse on what insanity all existence is based.\nUltimately, it is entirely a matter of indifference whether we are something,\neven if we are God. On this, with a little pressure, almost everyone might be\nbrought to agree. But how does it happen then that everyone aspires to\nfurther life, to additional being, and that there is no one who strives to sink,\nto descend toward the ideal default?\nAccording to a belief rather widespread among certain tribes, the dead\nspeak the same language as the living, except that for them words have a\nmeaning contrary to the one they had: large means small, near far, black\nwhite….\nDoes dying come down to that? Still, better than any funereal invention,\nthis complete reversal of language indicates what is unwonted,\ndumbfounding about death….\n\f\nI am perfectly willing to believe in man’s future, but how is one to manage\nit when still, after all, in possession of one’s faculties? It would take their\nvirtually complete collapse, and even then …!\nA thought which is not secretly stamped by fatality is interchangeable,\nworthless, is merely thought….\nIn Turin, at the beginning of his madness, Nietzsche would rush to his\nmirror, look at himself, turn away, look again. In the train that was taking\nhim to Basel, the one thing he always asked for was a mirror. He no longer\nknew who he was, kept looking for himself, and this man, so eager to\nprotect his identity, so thirsty for himself, had no instrument at hand but the\nclumsiest, the most lamentable of expedients.\nNo one more useless, and more unusable, than I: a datum I must quite\nsimply accept, without taking any pride in the fact whatever. So long as this\nis not the case, the consciousness of my usclessness will serve for nothing.\nWhatever the nightmare, one takes a role in it, one is the protagonist, one is\nsomething. It is at night that the disinherited man triumphs. If we were to\nsuppress bad dreams, there would be mass revolutions.\nTerror of the future is always grafted onto the desire to experience that\nterror.\n\f\nSuddenly I was alone with … I felt, that afternoon of my childhood, that a\nvery serious event had just occurred. It was my first awakening, the first\nindication, the premonitory sign of consciousness. Before that I had been\nonly a being. From that moment, I was more and less than that. Each begins\nwith a rift and a revelation.\nBirth and chain are synonyms. To see the light of day, to see shackles …\nTo say “Everything is illusory” is to court illusion, to accord it a high\ndegree of reality, the highest in fact, whereas on the contrary one wanted to\ndiscredit it. The solution? To stop proclaiming or denouncing it, serving it\nby thinking about it. The very idea that disqualifies all ideas is a fetter.\nIf we could sleep twenty-four hours a day, we would soon return to the\nprimordial slime, the beatitude of that perfect torpor before Genesis—the\ndream of every consciousness sick of itself.\nNot to be born is undoubtedly the best plan of all. Unfortunately it is within\nno one’s reach.\nNo one has loved this world more than I, and yet if it had been offered to\nme, even as a child, on a platter, I should have shrieked, “Too late, too\nlate!”\n“What’s wrong—what’s the matter with you?” Nothing, nothing’s the\nmatter, I’ve merely taken a leap outside my fate, and now I don’t know\n\f\nwhere to turn, what to run for…."
