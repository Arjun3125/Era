    "raw_text": "Introduction: John Freeman \nThe origins of this book are sufficiently unusual to be of interest, and \nthey bear a direct relation to its contents and what it sets out to do. So \nlet me tell you just how it came to be written. \nOne day in the spring of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation \ninvited me to interview for British television Dr. Carl Gustav Jung. \nThe interview was to be done \"in depth.\" I knew little enough at that \ntime about Jung and his work, and I at once went to make his acquaint­\nance at his beautiful lakeside home near Zurich. That was the beginning \nof a friendship that meant a great deal to me and, I hope, gave some \npleasure to Jung in the last years of his life. The television interview \nhas no further place in this story, except that it was accounted successful \nand that this book is by an odd combination of circumstances an end-\nproduct of that success. \nOne man who saw Jung on the screen was Wolfgang Foges, manag­\ning director of Aldus Books. Foges had been keenly interested in the \ndevelopment of modern psychology since his childhood, when he lived \nnear the Freuds in Vienna. And as he watched Jung talking about his \nlife and work and ideas, Foges suddenly reflected what a pity it was \nthat, while the general outline of Freud's work was well known to \neducated readers all over the Western world, Jung had never managed \nto break through to the general public and was always considered too \ndifficult for popular reading. \nFoges, in fact, is the creator of Man and his Symbols. Having sensed \nfrom the TV screen that a warm personal relation existed between \nJung and myself, he asked me whether I would join him in trying to \npersuade Jung to set out some of his more important and basic ideas in \nlanguage and at a length that would be intelligible and interesting to \nnon-specialist adult readers. I jumped at the idea and set off once more \nto Zurich, determined that I could convince Jung of the value and \nimportance of such a work. Jung listened to me in his garden for two \nhours almost without interruption — and then said no. He said it in the \nnicest possible way, but with great firmness; he had never in the past \ntried to popularize his work, and he wasn't sure that he could success­\nfully do so now; anyway, he was old and rather tired and not keen to \ntake on such a long commitment about which he had so many doubts. \nJung's friends will all agree with me that he was a man of most \npositive decision. He would weigh up a problem with care and without \n9\n\f\nhurry; but when he did give his answer, it was usually final. I returned \nto London greatly disappointed, but convinced that Jung's refusal was \nthe end of the matter. So it might have been, but for two intervening \nfactors that I had not foreseen. \nOne was the pertinacity of Foges, who insisted on making one more \napproach to Jung before accepting defeat. The other was an event that, \nas I look back on it, still astonishes me. \nThe television program was, as I have said, accounted successful. It \nbrought Jung a great many letters from all sorts of people, many of \nthem ordinary folk with no medical or psychological training, who had \nbeen captivated by the commanding presence, the humor, and the \nmodest charm of this very great man, and who had glimpsed in his \nview of life and human personality something that could be helpful to \nthem. And Jung was very pleased, not simply at getting letters (his \nmail was enormous at all times) but at getting them from people who \nwould normally have no contact with him. \nIt was at this moment that he dreamed a dream of the greatest \nimportance to him. (And as you read this book, you will understand \njust how important that can be.) He dreamed that, instead of sitting \nin his study and talking to the great doctors and psychiatrists who used \nto call on him from all over the world, he was standing in a public \nplace and addressing a multitude of people who were listening to him \nwith rapt attention and understanding what he said. . . . \nWhen, a week or two later, Foges renewed his request that Jung \nshould undertake a new book designed, not for the clinic or the philo­\nsopher's study, but for the people in the market place, Jung allowed \nhimself to be persuaded. He laid down two conditions. First, that the \nbook should not be a single-handed book, but the collective effort of \nhimself and a group of his closest followers, through whom he had \nattempted to perpetuate his methods and his teaching. Secondly, that I \nshould be entrusted with the task of co-ordinating the work and resolv­\ning any problems that might arise between the authors and the \npublishers. \nLest it should seem that this introduction transgresses the bounds of \nreasonable modesty, let me say at once that I was gratified by this \nsecond condition — but within measure. For it very soon came to my \nknowledge that Jung's reason for selecting me was essentially that he \nI ()\n\f\nregarded me as being of reasonable, but not exceptional, intelligence \nand without the slightest serious knowledge of psychology. Thus I was \nto Jung the \"average reader\" of this book; what I could understand \nwould be intelligible to all who would be interested; what I boggled \nat might possibly be too difficult or obscure for some. Not unduly flat­\ntered by this estimate of my role, I have none the less scrupulously in­\nsisted (sometimes, I fear, to the exasperation of the authors) on having \nevery paragraph written and, if necessary, rewritten to a degree of \nclarity and directness that enables me to say with confidence that this \nbook in its entirety is designed for and addressed to the general reader, \nand that the complex subjects it deals with are treated with a rare and \nencouraging simplicity. \nAfter much discussion, the comprehensive subject of this book was \nagreed to be Man and his Symbols; and Jung himself selected as his \ncollaborators in the work Dr. Marie-Louise von Franz of Zurich, per­\nhaps his closest professional confidante and friend; Dr. Joseph L. Hen­\nderson of San Francisco, one of the most prominent and trusted of \nAmerican Jungians; Mrs. Aniela Jaffe of Zurich, who, in addition to \nbeing an experienced analyst, was Jung's confidential private secretary \nand his biographer; and Dr. Jolande Jacobi, who after Jung himself \nis the most experienced author among Jung's Zurich circle. These four \npeople were chosen partly because of their skill and experience in the \nparticular subjects allocated to them and partly because all of them \nwere completely trusted by Jung to work unselfishly to his instructions \nas members of a team. Jung's personal responsibility was to plan the \nstructure of the whole book, to supervise and direct the work of his \ncollaborators, and himself to write the keynote chapter, \"Approaching \nthe Unconscious.\" \nThe last year of his life was devoted almost entirely to this book, and \nwhen he died in June 1961, his own section was complete (he finished \nit, in fact, only some 10 days before his final illness) and his colleagues' \nchapters had all been approved by him in draft. After his death, Dr. \nvon Franz assumed over-all responsibility for the completion of the \nbook in accordance with Jung's express instructions. The subject matter \nof Man and his Symbols and its outline were therefore laid down— \nand in detail—by Jung. The chapter that bears his name is his work \nand (apart from some fairly extensive editing to improve its intelligi-\n11"

The remaining chapters were written by the various authors \nto Jung's direction and under his supervision. The final editing of the \ncomplete work after Jung's death has been done by Dr. von Franz with \na patience, understanding, and good humor that leave the publishers \nand myself greatly in her debt. \nFinally as to the contents of the book itself: \nJung's thinking has colored the world of modern psychology more \nthan many of those with casual knowledge realize. Such familiar terms, \nfor instance, as \"extravert,\" \"introvert,\" and \"archetype\" are all \nJungian concepts—borrowed and sometimes misused by others. But his \noverwhelming contribution to psychological understanding is his con­\ncept of the unconscious—not (like the unconscious of Freud) merely \na sort of glory-hole of repressed desires, but a world that is just as much \na vital and real part of the life of an individual as the conscious, \n\"cogitating\" world of the ego, and infinitely wider and richer. The \nlanguage and the \"people\" of the unconscious are symbols, and the \nmeans of communications dreams. \nThus an examination of Man and his Symbols is in effect an exami­\nnation of man's relation to his own unconscious. And since in Jung's \nview the unconscious is the great guide, friend, and adviser of the \nconscious, this book is related in the most direct terms to the study of \nhuman beings and their spiritual problems. We know the unconscious \nand communicate with it (a two-way service) principally by dreams; \nand all through this book (above all in Jung's own chapter) you will \nfind a quite remarkable emphasis placed on the importance of dream­\ning in the life of the individual. \nIt would be an impertinence on my part to attempt to interpret \nJung's work to readers, many of whom will surely be far better quali­\nfied to understand it than I am. My role, remember, was merely to \nserve as a sort of \"intelligibility filter\" and by no means as an inter­\npreter. Nevertheless, I venture to offer two general points that seem \nimportant to me as a layman and that may possibly be helpful to other \nnon-experts. The first is about dreams. To Jungians the dream is not a \nkind of standardized cryptogram that can be decoded by a glossary \nof symbol meanings. It is an integral, important, and personal expres­\nsion of the individual unconscious. It is just as \"real\" as any other \nI 2\n\f\nphenomenon attaching to the individual. The, dreamer's individual \nunconscious is communicating with the dreamer alone and is selecting \nsymbols for its purpose that have meaning to the dreamer and to \nnobody else. Thus the interpretation of dreams, whether by the analyst \nor by the dreamer himself, is for the Jungian psychologist an entirely \npersonal and individual business (and sometimes an experimental and \nvery lengthy one as well) that can by no means be undertaken by \nrule of thumb. \nThe converse of this is that the communications of the unconscious \nare of the highest importance to the dreamer—naturally so, since the \nunconscious is at least half of his total being—and frequently offer him \nadvice or guidance that could be obtained from no other source. Thus, \nwhen I described Jung's dream about addressing the multitude, I was \nnot describing a piece of magic or suggesting that Jung dabbled in \nfortune telling. I was recounting in the simple terms of daily experience \nhow Jung was \"advised\" by his own unconscious to reconsider an \ninadequate judgment he had made with the conscious part of his mind. \nNow it follows from this that the dreaming of dreams is not a matter \nthat the well-adjusted Jungian can regard as simply a matter of \nchance. On the contrary, the ability to establish communications with \nthe unconscious is a part of the whole man, and Jungians \"teach\" \nthemselves (I can think of no better term) to be receptive to dreams. \nWhen, therefore, Jung himself1 was faced with the critical decision \nwhether or not to write this book, he was able to draw on the resources \nof both his conscious and his unconscious in making up his mind. And \nall through this book you will find the dream treated as a direct, per­\nsonal, and meaningful communication to the dreamer —a communica­\ntion that uses the symbols common to ajl mankind, but that uses them \non every occasion in an entirely individual way that can be interpreted \nonly by an entirely individual \"key.\" \nThe second point I wish to make is about a particular characteristic \nof argumentative method that is common to all the writers of this book \nperhaps to all Jungians. Those who have limited themselves to living \nentirely in the world of the conscious and who reject communication \nwith the unconscious bind themselves by the laws of conscious, formal \nlife. With the infallible (but often meaningless) logic of the algebraic \nequation, they argue from assumed premises to incontestably deduced \n'3"

    "raw_text": "conclusions. Jung and his colleagues seem to me (whether they know it \nor not) to reject the limitations of this method of argument. It is not \nthat they ignore logic, but they appear all the time to be arguing to the \nunconscious as well as to the conscious. Their dialectical method is itself \nsymbolic and often devious. They convince not by means of the nar­\nrowly focused spotlight of the syllogism, but by skirting, by repetition, \nby presenting a recurring view of the same subject seen each time from \na slightly different angle — until suddenly the reader who has never \nbeen aware of a single, conclusive moment of proof finds that he has \nunknowingly embraced and taken into himself some wider truth. \nJung's arguments (and those of his colleagues) spiral upward over \nhis subject like a bird circling a tree. At first, near the ground, it sees \nonly a confusion of leaves and branches. Gradually, as it circles higher \nand higher, the recurring aspects of the tree form a wholeness and \nrelate to their surroundings. Some readers may find this \"spiraling\" \nmethod of argument obscure or even confusing for a few pages—but \nnot, I think, for long. It is characteristic of Jung's method, and very \nsoon the reader will find it carrying him with it on a persuasive and \nprofoundly absorbing journey. \nThe different sections of this book speak for themselves and require \nlittle introduction from me. Jung's own chapter introduces the reader \nto the unconscious, to the archetypes and symbols that form its langu­\nage and to the dreams by which it communicates. Dr. Henderson in \nthe following chapter illustrates the appearance of several archetypal \npatterns in ancient mythology, folk legend, and primitive ritual. Dr. \nvon Franz, in the chapter entitled \"The Process of Individuation,\" \ndescribes the process by which the conscious and the unconscious \nwithin an individual learn to know, respect, and accommodate one \nanother. In a certain sense this chapter contains not only the crux of \nthe whole book, but perhaps the essence of Jung's philosophy of life: \nMan becomes whole, integrated, calm, fertile, and happy when (and \nonly when) the process of individuation is complete, when the con­\nscious and the unconscious have learned to live at peace and to com­\nplement one another. Mrs. Jaffe, like Dr. Henderson, is concerned \nwith demonstrating, in the familiar fabric of the conscious, man's \nrecurring interest in—almost obsession with — the symbols of the un­\nconscious. They have for him a profoundly significant, almost a nour-\n14\n\f\nishing and sustaining, inner attraction — whether they occur in the \nmyths and fairy tales that Dr. Henderson analyzes or in the visual arts, \nwhich, as Mrs. Jaffe shows, satisfy and delight us by a constant appeal \nto the unconscious. \nFinally, I must say a brief word about Dr. Jacobi's chapter, which \nis somewhat separate from the rest of the book. It is in fact an abbre­\nviated case history of one interesting and successful analysis. The value \nof such a chapter in a book like this is obvious; but two words of warn­\ning are nevertheless necessary. First, as Dr. von Franz points out, there \nis no such thing as a typical Jungian analysis. There can't be, because \nevery dream is a private and individual communication, and no two \ndreams use the symbols of the unconscious in the same way. So every \nJungian analysis is unique — and it is misleading to consider this one, \ntaken from Dr. Jacobi's clinical files (or any other one there has ever \nbeen), as \"representative\" or \"typical.\" All one can say of the case of \nHenry and his sometimes lurid dreams is that they form one true \nexample of the way in which the Jungian method may be applied to \na particular case. Secondly, the full history of even a comparatively \nuncomplicated case would take a whole book to recount. Inevitably, the \nstory of Henry's analysis suffers a little in compression. The references, \nfor instance, to the / Ching have been somewhat obscured and lent an \nunnatural (and to me unsatisfactory) flavor of the occult by being pre­\nsented out of their full context. Nevertheless, we concluded—and I am \nsure the reader will agree — that, with the warnings duly given, the \nclarity, to say nothing of the human interest, of Henry's analysis \ngreatly enriches this book. \nI began by describing how Jung came to write Man and his Symbols. \nI end by reminding the reader of what a remarkable — perhaps unique \n—publication this is. Carl Gustav Jung was one of the great doctors of \nall time and one of the great thinkers of this century. His object always \nwas to help men and women to know themselves, so that by self-know­\nledge and thoughtful self-use they could lead full, rich, and happy lives. \nAt the very end of his own life, which was as full, rich, and happy as \nany I have encountered, he decided to use the strength that was \nleft him to address his message to a wider public than he had ever \ntried to reach before. He completed his task and his life in the same \nmonth. This book is his legacy to the broad reading public. \n'5\n\f\nContents \nPart 1 Approaching the unconscious 18 \nCarl G.

    "raw_text": "Approaching the unconscious \nThe importance of dreams \nMan uses the spoken or written word to express \nthe meaning of what he wants to convey. His \nlanguage is full of symbols, but he also often \nemploys signs or images that are not strictly \ndescriptive. Some arc mere abbreviations or \nstrings of initials, such as UN, UNICEF, or \nUNESCO; others are familiar trade marks, the \nnames of patent medicines, badges, or insignia. \nAlthough these are meaningless in themselves, \nthey have acquired a recognizable meaning \nthrough common usage or deliberate intent. \nSuch things are not symbols. They are signs, \nand they do no more than denote the objects \nto which they are attached. \nWhat we call a symbol is a term, a name, or \neven a picture that may be familiar in daily \nlife, yet that possesses specific connotations in \naddition to its conventional and obvious mean­\ning. It implies something vague, unknown, or \nhidden from us. Many Cretan monuments, for \ninstance, arc marked with the design of the \ndouble adze. This is an object that we know, \nbut we do not know its symbolic implications. \nFor another example, take the case of the \nIndian who, after a visit to England, told his \nfriends at home that the English worship ani­\nmals, because he had found eagles, lions, and \noxen in old churches. He was not aware (nor \nare many Christians) that these animals are \nsymbols of the Evangelists and are derived from \nthe vision of Ezekiel, and that this in turn has \nan analogy to the Egyptian sun god Horus and \nhis four sons. There are, moreover, such objects \nas the wheel and the cross that are known all \nover the world, yet that have a symbolic signi­\nficance under certain conditions. Precisely what \nthey symbolize is still a matter for controversial \nspeculation. \nThus a word or an image is symbolic when it \nimplies something more than its obvious and \nimmediate meaning. It has a wider \"uncon­\nscious\" aspect that is never precisely defined or\n\f\nfully explained. Nor can one hope to define or \nexplain it. As the mind explores the symbol, it \nis led to ideas that lie beyond the grasp of \nreason. The wheel may lead our thoughts to­\nward the concept of a \"divine\" sun, but at this \npoint reason must admit its incompetence; man \nis unable to define a \"divine\" being. When, \nwith all our intellectual limitations, we call \nsomething \"divine,\" we have merely given it a \nname, which may be based on a creed, but \nnever on factual evidence. \nBecause there are innumerable things beyond \nthe range of human understanding, we con­\nstantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts \nthat we cannot define or fully comprehend. \nThis is one reason why all religions employ sym­\nbolic language or images. But this conscious use \nof symbols is only one aspect of a psychological \nfact of great importance: Man also produces \nsymbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in \nthe form of dreams. \nLeft, three of the four Evangelists \n(in a relief on Chartres Cathedral) \nappear as animals: The lion is Mark, \nthe ox Luke, the eagle John. Also \nanimals are three of the sons of the \nEgyptian god Horus (above, c. 1 250 \nB.C.), Animals, and groups of four, \nare universal religious symbols. \nIt is not easy to grasp this point. But the \npoint must be grasped if we are to know more \nabout the ways in which the human mind \nworks. Man, as we realize if we reflect for a \nmoment, never perceives anything fully or com-\nprehends anything completely. He can see, hear, \ntouch, and taste; but how far he sees, how well \nhe hears, what his touch tells him, and what he \ntastes depend upon the number and quality of \nhis senses. These limit his perception of the \nworld around him. By using scientific instru­\nments he can partly compensate for the defici­\nencies of his senses. For example, he can extend \nthe range of his vision by binoculars or of his \nhearing by electrical amplification. But the most \nelaborate apparatus cannot do more than bring \ndistant or small objects within range of his eyes, \nor make faint sounds more audible. No matter \nwhat instruments he uses, at some point he \nreaches the edge of certainty beyond which con­\nscious knowledge cannot pass. \n24\n\f\nIn many societies, representations \nof the sun express man's indefinable \nreligious experience. Above, a \ndecoration on the back of a throne \nbelonging to the 14th-century B.C. \nEgyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen is \ndominated by a sun disk; the hands \nat the end of the rays symbolize \nthe sun's life-giving power. Left, \na monk in 20th-century Japan prays \nbefore a mirror that represents the \ndivine Sun in the Shinto religion. \nRight, tungsten atoms seen with a \nmicroscope that magnifies 2,000,000 \ntimes. Far right, the spots in center \nof picture are the farthest visible \ngalaxies. No matter how far man \nextends his senses, limits to his \nconscious perception remain.\n\f\nThere are, moreover, unconscious aspects of \nour perception of reality. The first is the fact \nthat even when our senses react to real pheno­\nmena, sights, and sounds, they are somehow \ntranslated from the realm of reality into that \nof the mind. Within the mind they become \npsychic events, whose ultimate nature is un­\nknowable (for the psyche cannot know its own \npsychical substance). Thus every experience \ncontains an indefinite number of unknown fac­\ntors, not to speak of the fact that every concrete \nobject is always unknown in certain respects, \nbecause we cannot know the ultimate nature of \nmatter itself. \nThen there are certain events of which we \nhave not consciously taken note; they have re­\nmained, so to speak, below the threshold of con­\nsciousness. They have happened, but they have \nbeen absorbed subliminally, without our con­\nscious knowledge. We can become aware of \nsuch happenings only in a moment of intuition \nor by a process of profound thought that leads \nto a later realization that they must have hap­\npened; and though we may have originally \nignored their emotional and vital importance, it \nlater wells up from the unconscious as a sort \nof afterthought. \nIt may appear, for instance, in the form of a \ndream. As a general rule, the unconscious \naspect of any event is revealed to us in dreams, \nwhere it appears not as a rational thought but \nas a symbolic image. As a matter of history, it \nwas the study of dreams that first enabled \npsychologists to investigate the unconscious \naspect of conscious psychic events. \nIt is on such evidence that psychologists \nassume the existence of an unconscious psyche \n— though many scientists and philosophers deny \nits existence. They argue naively that such an \nassumption implies the existence of two \"sub­\njects,\" or (to put it in a common phrase) two \npersonalities within the same individual. But \nthis is exactly what it does imply—quite cor­\nrectly. And it is one of the curses of modern \nman that many people suffer from this divided \npersonality. It is by no means a pathological \nsymptom; it is a normal fact that can be ob­\nserved at any time and everywhere. It is not \nmerely the neurotic whose right hand does not \nknow what the left hand is doing. This predica­\nment is a symptom of a general unconsciousness \nthat is the undeniable common inheritance of \nall mankind. \nMan has developed consciousness slowly and \nlaboriously, in a process that took untold ages to \nreach the civilized state (which is arbitrarily \ndated from the invention of script in about \n4000 B.C). And this evolution is far from com­\nplete, for large areas of the human mind are \nstill shrouded in darkness. What we call the \n\"psyche\" is by no means identical with our \nconsciousness and its contents. \nWhoever denies the existence of the uncon­\nscious is in fact assuming that our present know­\nledge of the psyche is total. And this belief is \nclearly just as false as the assumption that we \nknow all there is to be known about the natural \nuniverse. Our psyche is part of nature, and its \nenigma is as limitless. Thus we cannot define \neither the psyche or nature. We can merely \nstate what we believe them to be and describe, \nas best we can, how they function. Quite apart, \ntherefore, from the evidence that medical \nresearch has accumulated, there are strong \ngrounds of logic for rejecting statements like \n\"There is no unconscious.\" Those who say such \nthings merely express an age-old \"misoneism\" \n— a fear of the new and the unknown. \n23\n\f\nThere are historical reasons for this resistance \nto the idea of an unknown part of the human \npsyche. Consciousness is a very recent acquisi­\ntion of nature, and it is still in an \"experimen­\ntal\" state. It is frail, menaced by specific dan­\ngers, and easily injured. As anthropologists have \nnoted, one of the most common mental de­\nrangements that occur among primitive people \nis what they call \"the loss of a soul\" —which \nmeans, as the name indicates, a noticeable dis­\nruption (or, more technically, a dissociation) of \nconsciousness. \nAmong such people, whose consciousness is \nat a different level of development from ours, \nthe \"soul\" (or psyche) is not felt to be a unit. \nMany primitives assume that a man has a \n\"bush soul\" as well as his own, and that this \nbush soul is incarnate in a wild animal or a tree, \nwith which the human individual has some kind \nof psychic identity. This is what the distin­\nguished French ethnologist Lucien Levy-Briihl \ncalled a \"mystical participation.\" He later re­\ntracted this term under pressure of adverse \ncriticism, but I believe that his critics were \nwrong. It is a well-known psychological fact \nthat an individual may have such an uncon­\nscious identity with some other person or object. \nThis identity takes a variety of forms among \nprimitives. If the bush soul is that of an animal, \nthe animal itself is considered as some sort of \nbrother to the man. A man whose brother is a \ncrocodile, for instance, is supposed to be safe \nwhen swimming a crocodile-infested river. If \nthe bush soul is a tree, the tree is presumed to \nhave something like parental authority over the \nindividual concerned. In both cases an injury \nto the bush soul is interpreted as an injury to \nthe man. \nIn some tribes, it is assumed that a man has \na number of souls; this belief expresses the feel­\ning of some primitive individuals that they each \nconsist of several linked but distinct units. This \nmeans that the individual's psyche is far from \nbeing safely synthesized; on the contrary, it \nthreatens to fragment only too easily under the \nonslaught of unchecked emotions. \nWhile this situation is familiar to us from the \nstudies of anthropologists, it is not so irrelevant \nto our own advanced civilization as it might \nseem. We too can become dissociated and lose \n\"Dissociation\" means a splitting in \nthe psyche, causing a neurosis. A \nfamous fictional example of this \nstate is  Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde \n(1886) by the Scots author R. L \nStevenson. In the story Jekyll's \n\"split\" took the form of a physical \nchange, rather than (as in reality) \nan inner, psychic state. Left, Mr. \nHyde (from the 1 932 film of the \nstory) —Jekyll's \"other half.\" \nPrimitive people call dissociation \n\"loss of a soul\"; they believe that \na man has a \"bush soul\" as well as \nhis own. Right, a Nyanga tribesman \nof west central Africa wearing a mask \nof the hornbill — the bird that he \nidentifies with his bush soul. \nFar right, telephonists on a busy \nswitchboard handle many calls at \nonce. In such jobs people \"split \noff\" parts of their conscious minds \nto concentrate. But this split is \ncontrolled and temporary, not a \nspontaneous, abnormal dissociation. \n2 I"

We can be possessed and altered \nby moods, or become unreasonable and unable \nto recall important facts about ourselves or \nothers, so that people ask: \"What the devil has \ngot into you?\" We talk about being able \"to \ncontrol ourselves,\" but self-control is a rare and \nremarkable virtue. We may think we have our­\nselves under control; yet a friend can easily tell \nus things about ourselves of which we have no \nknowledge. \nBeyond doubt, even in what we call a high \nlevel of civilization, human consciousness has \nnot yet achieved a reasonable degree of conti­\nnuity. It is still vulnerable and liable to frag­\nmentation. This capacity to isolate part of one's \nmind, indeed, is a valuable characteristic. It \nenables us to concentrate upon one thing at a \ntime, excluding everything else that may claim \nour attention. But there is a world of difference \nbetween a conscious decision to split off and \ntemporarily suppress a part of one's psyche, and \na condition in which this happens spontane­\nously, without one's knowledge or consent and \neven against one's intention. The former is a \ncivilized achievement, the latter a primitive \n\"loss of a soul,\" or even the pathological cause \nof a neurosis. \nThus, even in our day the unity of con­\nsciousness is still a doubtful affair; it can too \neasily be disrupted. An ability to control one's \nemotions that may be very desirable from one \npoint of view would be a questionable accom­\nplishment from another, for it would deprive \nsocial intercourse of varietv. color, and warmth. \nIt is against this background that we must \nreview the importance of dreams those flimsy, \nevasive, unreliable, vague, and uncertain fan­\ntasies. To explain my point of view, I should \nlike to describe how it developed over a period \nof years, and how I was led to conclude that \ndreams are the most frequent and universally \naccessible source for the investigation of man's \nsymbolizing faculty. \nSigmund Freud was the pioneer who first \ntried to explore empirically the unconscious \nbackground of consciousness. He worked on the \ngeneral assumption that dreams are not a matter \nof chance but are associated with conscious \nthoughts and problems. This assumption was \nnot in the least arbitrary. It was based upon the \n25\n\f\nconclusion of eminent neurologists (for instance, \nPierre Janet) that neurotic symptoms are re­\nlated to some conscious experience. They even \nappear to be split-off areas of the conscious \nmind, which, at another time and under differ­\nent conditions, can be conscious. \nBefore the beginning of this century, Freud \nand Josef Breuer had recognized that neurotic \nsymptoms — hysteria, certain types of pain, and \nabnormal behavior—are in fact symbolically \nmeaningful. They are one way in which the \nunconscious mind expresses itself, just as it \nmay in dreams; and they are equally symbolic. \nA patient, for instance, who is confronted with \nan intolerable situation may develop a spasm \nwhenever he tries to swallow: He \"can't swal­\nlow it.\" Under similar conditions of psycholo­\ngical stress, another patient has an attack of \nasthma: He \"can't breathe the atmosphere at \nhome.\" A third suffers from a peculiar para­\nlysis of the legs: He can't walk, i.e. \"he can't \ngo on any more.\" A fourth, who vomits when \nhe eats, \"cannot digest\" some unpleasant fact. \nI could cite many examples of this kind, but \nsuch physical reactions are only one form in \nwhich the problems that trouble us unconsci­\nously may express themselves. They more often \nfind expression in our dreams. \nAny psychologist who has listened to num­\nbers of people describing their dreams knows \nthat dream symbols have much greater variety \nthan the physical symptoms of neurosis. They \noften consist of elaborate and picturesque fan­\ntasies. But if the analyst who is confronted by \nthis dream material uses Freud's original tech­\nnique of \"free association,\" he finds that dreams \n1 Sigmund Freud (Vienna) \n2 Otto Rank (Vienna) \n3 Ludwig Binswanger (Kreuzlingen) \n4 A A Brill \n5 Max Eitingon (Berlin) \n6 James J. Putnam (Boston) \n7 Ernest Jones (Toronto) \n8 Wilhelm Stekel (Vienna) \n9 Eugen Bleuler (Zurich) \n10 Emma Jung (Kusnacht) \n11 Sandor Ferenczi (Budapest) \n12 C. G Jung (Kusnacht) \n26\n\f\ncan eventually be reduced to certain basic pat­\nterns. This technique played an important part \nin the development of psychoanalysis, for it \nenabled Freud to use dreams as the starting \npoint from which the unconscious problem of \nthe patient might be explored. \nFreud made the simple but penetrating obser­\nvation that if a dreamer is encouraged to go on \ntalking about his dream images and the thoughts \nthat these prompt in his mind, he will give \nhimself away and reveal the unconscious back­\nground of his ailments, in both what he says \nand what he deliberately omits saying. His ideas \nmay seem irrational and irrelevant, but after a \ntime it becomes relatively easy to see what it is \nthat he is trying to avoid, what unpleasant \nthought or experience he is suppressing. No \nmatter how he tries to camouflage it, every­\nthing he says points to the core of his predica­\nment. A doctor sees so many things from the \nseamy side of life that he is seldom far from the \ntruth when he interprets the hints that his \npatient produces as signs of an uneasy con­\nscience. What he eventually discovers, unfor­\ntunately, confirms his expectations. Thus far, \nnobody can say anything against Freud's theory \nof repression and wish fulfillment as apparent \ncauses of dream symbolism. \nFreud attached particular importance to \ndreams as the point of departure for a process \nof \"free association.\" But after a time I began to \nfeel that this was a misleading and inadequate \nuse of the rich fantasies that the unconscious \nproduces in sleep. My doubts really began when \na colleague told me of an experience he had \nduring the course of a long train journey in \nRussia. Though he did not know the language \nand could not even decipher the Cyrillic script, \nhe found himself musing over the strange letters \nin which the railway notices were written, and \nhe fell into a reverie in which he imagined all \nsorts of meanings for them. \nOne idea led to another, and in his relaxed \nmood he found that this \"free association\" had \nstirred up many old memories. Among them \nhe was annoyed to find some long-buried dis­\nagreeable topics things he had wished to for­\nget and had forgotten consciously. He had in \nfact arrived at what psychologists would call \nhis \"complexes\" — that is, repressed emotional \nthemes that can cause constant psychological \ndisturbances or even, in many cases, the symp­\ntoms of neurosis. \nThis episode opened mv eves to the far! thai \nit was not necessary to use a dream as the point \nof departure for the process of \"free association\" \nif one wished to discover the complexes of a \npatient. It showed me that one can reach the \ncenter directly from any point of the compass. \nOne could begin from Cyrillic letters, from \nLeft, many of the great pioneers of \nmodern psychoanalysis, photo­\ngraphed at a Congress of \nPsychoanalysis in i 911 at Weimar, \nGermany. The key, below left, \nidentifies some of the major figures. \nRight, the \"inkblot\" test devised \nby the Swiss psychiatrist Hermann \nRorschach. The shape of the blot \ncan serve as a stimulus for free \nassociation; in fact, almost any \nirregular free shape can spark off \nthe associative process. Leonardo \nda Vinci wrote in his  Notebooks: \n\"It should not be hard for you to \nstop sometimes and look into the \nstains of walls, or ashes of a fire, \nor clouds, or mud or like places, \nin which ... you may find really \nmarvelous ideas.\"\n\f\nmeditations upon a crystal ball, a prayer wheel, \nor a modern painting, or even from casual con­\nversation about some quite trivial event. The \ndream was no more and no less useful in this \nrespect than any other possible starting point. \nNevertheless, dreams have a particular signifi­\ncance, even though they often arise from an \nemotional upset in which the habitual complexes \nare also involved. (The habitual complexes are \nthe tender spots of the psyche, which react most \nquickly to an external stimulus or disturbance.) \nThat is why free association can lead one from \nany dream to the critical secret thoughts. \nAt this point, however, it occurred to me that \n(if I was right so far) it might reasonably follow \nthat dreams have some special and more signi­\nficant function of their own. Very often dreams \nhave a definite, evidently purposeful structure, \nindicating an underlying idea or intention \nthough, as a rule, the latter is not immediately \ncomprehensible. I therefore began to consider \nwhether one should pay more attention to the \nactual form and content of a dream, rather than \nallowing \"\"free\" association to lead one off \nthrough a train of ideas to complexes that could \nas easily be reached by other means. \nThis new thought was a turning point in the \ndevelopment of my psychology. It meant that I \ngradually gave up following associations that \nled far away from the text of a dream. I chose \nto concentrate rather on the associations to the \ndream itself, believing that the latter expressed \nsomething specific that the unconscious was \ntrying to say. \nThe change in my attitude toward dreams \ninvolved a change of method; the new tech-\nTwo different possible stimuli of \nfree association: the whirling \nprayer wheel of a Tibetan beggar \n(left), or a fortune teller's crystal \nball (right, a modern crystal gazer \nat a British fair). \nnique was one that could take account of all \nthe various wider aspects of a dream. A story \ntold by the conscious mind has a beginning, a \ndevelopment, and an end, but the same is not \ntrue of a dream. Its dimensions in time and \nspace are quite different; to understand it you \nmust examine it from every aspect—just as you \nmay take an unknown object in your hands and \nturn it over and over until you are familiar \nwith every detail of its shape. \nPerhaps I have now said enough to show how \nI came increasingly to disagree with \"free\" \nassociation as Freud first employed it: I wanted \nto keep as close as possible to the dream itself, \nand to exclude all the irrelevant ideas and asso­\nciations that it might evoke. True, these could \nlead one toward the complexes of a patient, \nbut I had a more far-reaching purpose in mind \nthan the discovery of complexes that cause \nneurotic disturbances. There are many other \nmeans by which these can be identified: The \npsychologist, for instance, can get all the hints \nhe needs by using word-association tests (by ask­\ning the patient what he associates to a given \nset of words, and by studying his responses). \nBut to know and understand the psychic life-"

    "raw_text": "process of an individual's whole personality, it \nis important to realize that his dreams and their \nsymbolic images have a much more important \nrole to play. \nAlmost everyone knows, for example, that \nthere is an enormous variety of images by which \nthe sexual act can be symbolized (or, one might \nsay, represented in the form of an allegory). \nEach of these images can lead, by a process of \nassociation, to the idea of sexual intercourse and \nto specific complexes that any individual may \nhave about his own sexual attitudes. But one \ncould just as well unearth such complexes by \nday-dreaming on a set of indecipherable Russian \nletters. I was thus led to the assumption that a \ndream can contain some message other than the \nsexual allegory, and that it does so for definite \nreasons. To illustrate this point: \nA man may dream of inserting a key in a \nlock, of wielding a heavy stick, or of breaking \ndown a door with a battering ram. Each of \nthese can be regarded as a sexual allegory. But \nthe fact that his unconscious for its own pur­\nposes has chosen one of these specific images \nit may be the key, the stick, or the battering \nram is also of major significance. The real \ntask is to understand why the key has been \npreferred to the stick, or the stick to the ram. \nAnd sometimes this might even lead one to dis­\ncover that it is not the sexual act at all that is \nrepresented, but some quite different psycholo­\ngical point. \nFrom this line of reasoning, I concluded that \nonly the material that is clearly and visibly part \nof a dream should be used in interpreting it. \nThe dream has its own limitation. Its specific \nOne of the countless symbolic or \nallegorical images of the sexual \nact isa deer hunt: Right, a detail \nfrom a painting by the 16th-century \nGerman artist Cranach. The sexual \nimplication of the deer hunt is \nunderlined by a medieval English \nfolk song called \"The Keeper\": \nThe first doe that he shot at he \nmissed. \nAnd the second doe he trimmed he \nkissed, \nAnd the third ran away in a young \nman's heart. \nShe's amongst the leaves of the \ngreen 0 \nform itself tells us what belongs to it and what \nleads away from it. While \"free\" association \nlures one away from that material in a kind of \nzigzag line, the method I evolved is more like a \ncircumambulation whose center is the dream \npicture. I work all around the dream picture \nand disregard every attempt that the dreamer \nmakes to break away from it. Time and time \nagain, in my professional work, I have had to \nrepeat the words: \"Let's get back to your \ndream. What does the dream say?\" \nFor instance, a patient of mine dreamed of \na drunken and disheveled vulgar woman. In \nthe dream, it seemed that this woman was his \nwife, though in real life his wife was totally \ndifferent. On the surface, therefore, the dream \nwas shockingly untrue, and the patient imme­\ndiately rejected it as dream nonsense. If I, as his \ndoctor, had let him start a process of associa­\ntion, he would inevitably have tried to get as far \naway as possible from (he unpleasant suggestion \nof his dream. In that case, he would have ended \nwith one of his staple complexes a complex, \npossibly, that had nothing to do with his wife \nand we should have learned nothing about the \nspecial meaning of this particular dream."

    "raw_text": "A key in a lock  may  be a sexual \nsymbol — but not invariably. Left, \na section of an altarpiece by the \n1 5th-century Flemish artist Campin. \nThe door was intended to symbolize \nhope, the lock to symbolize charity, \nand the key to symbolize the desire \nfor God. Below, a British bishop \nduring the consecration of a church \ncarries out a traditional ceremony \nby knocking on the church door with \na staff—which is obviously not a \nphallic symbol but a symbol of \nauthority and the shepherd's crook. \nNo individual symbolic image can be \nsaid to have a dogmatically fixed, \ngeneralized meaning. \nThe \"anima\" is the female element \nin the male unconscious. (It and the \n\"animus\" in the female unconscious \nare discussed in Chapter 3.) This \ninner duality is often symbolized \nby a hermaphroditic figure, like \nthe crowned hermaphrodite, above \nright, from a 1 7th-century alchemical \nmanuscript. Right, a physical image \nof man's psychic \"bisexuality\": a \nhuman cell with its chromosomes. \nAll organisms have two sets of \nchromosomes—one from each parent. \n,30\n\f\nWhat, then, was his unconscious trying to \nconvey by such an obviously untrue statement? \nClearly, it somehow expressed the idea of a \ndegenerate female who was closely connected \nwith the dreamer's life; but since the projection \nof this image on to his wife was unjustified and \nfactually untrue, I had to look elsewhere \nbefore I found out what this repulsive image \nrepresented. \nIn the Middle Ages, long before the physio­\nlogists demonstrated that by reason of our \nglandular structure there are both male and \nfemale elements in all of us, it was said that \n\"every man carries a woman within himself \nIt is this female element in every male that I \nhave called the \"anima.\" This \"feminine\" \naspect is essentially a certain inferior kind of \nrelatedness to the surroundings, and particu­\nlarly to women, which is kept carefully con­\ncealed from others as well as from oneself. \nIn other words, though an individual's visible-\npersonality may seem quite normal, he may \nwell be concealing from others or even from \nhimself—the deplorable condition of \"the \nwoman within.\" \nThat was the case with this particular \npatient: His female side was not nice. His \ndream was actually saying to him: \"You are in \nsome respects behaving like a degenerate \nfemale,\" and thus gave him an appropriate \nshock. (An example of this kind, of course, must \nnot be taken as evidence that the unconscious \nis concerned with \"moral\" injunctions. The \ndream was not telling the patient to \"behave \nbetter,\" but was simply trying to balance the \nlopsided nature of his conscious mind, which \nwas maintaining the fiction that he was a \nperfect gentleman throughout.) \nIt is easy to understand why dreamers tend \nto ignore and even deny the message of their \ndreams. Consciousness naturally resists any­\nthing unconscious and unknown. I have already \npointed out the existence among primitive \npeoples of what anthropologists call \"miso-\nncism,\" a deep and superstitious fear of novelty. \nThe primitives manifest all the reactions of the \nwild animal against untoward events. But \n\"civilized\" man reacts to new ideas in much \nthe same way, erecting psychological barriers to \nprotect himself from the shock of facing some­\nthing new. This can easily be observed in any \nindividual's reaction to his own dreams when \nobliged to admit a surprising thought. Many \npioneers in philosophy, science, and even litera­\nture have been victims of the innate conserv­\natism of their contemporaries. Psychology is \none of the youngest of the sciences; because it \nattempts to deal with the working of the uncon­\nscious, it has inevitably encountered misoneism \nin an extreme form. \n:5>\n\f\nPast and future in the unconscious \nSo far, I have been sketching some of the prin­\nciples on which I approached the problem of \ndreams, for when we want to investigate man's \nfaculty to produce symbols, dreams prove to be \nthe most basic and accessible material for this \npurpose. The two fundamental points in deal­\ning with dreams are these: First, the dream \nshould be treated as a fact, about which one \nmust make no previous assumption except that \nit somehow makes sense; and second, the dream \nis a specific expression of the unconscious. \nOne could scarcely put these principles more \nmodestly. No matter how low anyone's opinion \nof the unconscious may be, he must concede \nthat it is worth investigating; the unconscious \nis at least on a level with the louse, which, after \nall, enjoys the honest interest of the entomolo­\ngist. If somebody with little experience and \nknowledge of dreams thinks that dreams arc-\njust chaotic occurrences without meaning, he \nis at liberty to do so. But if one assumes that \nthey are normal events (which, as a matter of \nfact, they are), one is bound to consider that \nthey arc either causal i.e. that there is a \nrational cause for their existence or in a cer­\ntain way purposive, or both. \nLet us now look a little more closely at the \nways in which the conscious and unconscious \ncontents of the mind are linked together. Take \nan example with which everyone is familiar. \nSuddenly you find you cannot remember what \nyou were going to say next, though a moment \nago the thought was perfectly clear. Or perhaps \nyou were about to introduce a friend, and his \nname escaped you as you were about to utter it. \nYou say you cannot remember; in fact, though, \nthe thought has become unconscious, or at \nleast momentarily separated from conscious­\nness. We find the same phenomenon with our \nsenses. If we listen to a continuous note on the \nfringe of audibility, the sound seems to stop \nat regular intervals and then start again. Such \noscillations are due to a periodic decrease and \nincrease in one's attention, not to any change \nin the note. \nBut when something slips out of our con­\nsciousness it docs not cease to exist, any more \nthan a car that has disappeared round a corner \nhas vanished into thin air. It is simply out of \nsight. Just as we may later see the car again, \nso we come across thoughts that were tem­\nporarily lost to us. \nThus, part of the unconscious consists of a \nmultitude of temporarily obscured thoughts, \nimpressions, and images that, in spite of being \nlost, continue to influence our conscious minds.\n\f\nA man who is distracted or \"absent-minded\"\" \nwill walk across the room to fetch something. \nHe stops, seemingly perplexed; he has forgotten \nwhat he was after. His hands grope about \namong the objects on the table as if he were \nsleepwalking; he is oblivious of his original \npurpose, yet he is unconsciously guided by it. \nThen he realizes what it is that he wants. His \nunconscious has prompted him. \nIf you observe the behavior of a neurotic \nperson, you can see him doing many things \nthat he appears to be doing consciously and \npurposefully. Yet if you ask him about them, \nyou will discover that he is either unconscious \nof them or has something quite different in \nmind. He hears and does not hear; he sees, \nyet is blind; he knows and is ignorant. Such \nexamples are so common that the specialist soon \nrealizes that unconscious contents of the mind \nbehave as if they were conscious and that you \ncan never be sure, in such cases, whether \nthought, speech, or action is conscious or not. \nIt is this kind of behavior that makes so \nmany physicians dismiss statements by hysteri­\ncal patients as utter lies. Such persons certainly \nproduce more untruths than most of us, but \n\"lie\" is scarcely the right word to use. In fact, \ntheir mental state causes an uncertainty of \nbehavior because their consciousness is liable \nto unpredictable eclipse by an interference from \nthe unconscious. Even their skin sensations may \nreveal similar fluctuations of awareness. At one \nmoment the hysterical person may feel a needle \nprick in the arm; at the next it may pass unno­\nticed. If his attention can be focused on a cer­\ntain point, the whole of his body can be \ncompletely anesthetized until the tension that \ncauses this blackout of the senses has been re­\nlaxed. Sense perception is then immediately \nrestored. All the time, however, he has been \nunconsciously aware of what was happening. \nThe physician can see this process quite \nclearly when he hypnotizes such a patient. It \nis easy to demonstrate that the patient has been \naware of every detail. The prick in the arm or \nthe remark made during an eclipse of con­\nsciousness can be recalled as accurately as if \nthere had been no anesthesia or \"forgetfulness.\" \nI recall a woman who was once admitted to the \nclinic in a state of complete stupor. When she \nrecovered consciousness next day. she knew who \nshe was but did not know where she was. how \nor why she had come there, or even the date. \nYet after I had hypnotized her, she told me why \nshe had fallen ill. how she had got to the clinic, \nand who had admitted her. All these details \n\"Misoneism.\" an unreasoning fear \nand hatred of new ideas, was a major \nblock to public acceptance of modern \npsychStogy It also opposed Darwin's \ntheories of evolution — as when an \nAmerican schoolteacher named \nScopes was tried in 1925 for teaching \nevolution. Far left, at the trial, the \nlawyer Clarence Darrow defending \nScopes; center left, Scopes himself \nEgually ante Darwin is the cartoon, \nleft, from an 1861 issue of Britain's \nmagazine  Punch  Right, a light-\nhearted look at misoneism by the \nAmerican humorist James Thurber, \nwhose aunt (he wrote) was afraid \nthat electricity was \"leaking all \nover the place.'' \n33\n\f\ncould be verified. She was even able to tell the \ntime at which she had been admitted, because \nshe had seen a clock in the entrance hall. Under \nhypnosis, her memory was as clear as if she \nhad been completely conscious all the time. \nWhen we discuss such matters, we usually \nhave to draw on evidence supplied by clinical \nobservation. For this reason, many critics \nassume that the unconscious and all its subtle \nmanifestations belong solely to the sphere of \npsychopathology. They consider any expression \nof the unconscious as something neurotic or \npsychotic, which has nothing to do with a nor­\nmal mental state. But neurotic phenomena are \nby no means the products exclusively of disease. \nThey are in fact no more than pathological \nexaggerations of normal occurrences; it is only \nbecause they are exaggerations that they are \nmore obvious than their normal counterparts. \nHysterical symptoms can be observed in all \nnormal persons, but they are so slight that they \nusually pass unnoticed. \nForgetting, for instance, is a normal process, \nin which certain conscious ideas lose their speci­\nfic energy because one's attention has been \ndeflected. When interest turns elsewhere, it \nleaves in shadow the things with which one was \npreviously concerned, just as a searchlight lights \nup a new area by leaving another in dark­\nness. This is unavoidable, for consciousness can \nkeep only a few images in full clarity at one \ntime, and even this clarity fluctuates. \nBut the forgotten ideas have not ceased io \nexist. Although they cannot be reproduced al \nwill, they are present in a subliminal state just \nbeyond the threshold of recall from which \nthey can rise again spontaneously at any time, \noften alter many years of apparently total \noblivion. \nI am speaking here of things we have con­\nsciously seen or heard, and subsequently forgot­\nten. But we all see, hear, smell, and taste many \nthings without noticing them at the time, either \nbecause our attention is deflected or because \nthe stimulus to our senses is too slight to leave \na conscious impression. The unconscious, how­\never, has taken note of them, and such sublimi­\nnal sense perceptions play a significant part in \nour everyday lives. Without our realizing it, \nthey influence the way in which we react to \nboth events and people. \nAn example of this that I found particularly \nrevealing was provided by a professor who had \nbeen walking in the country with one of his \npupils, absorbed in serious conversation. Sud­\ndenly he noticed that his thoughts were being \ninterrupted by an unexpected flow of memories \nfrom his early childhood. He could not account \nfor this distraction. Nothing in what had been \nsaid seemed to have- any connection with these \nmemories. On looking back, he saw that he had \nbeen walking past a farm when the first of these \nchildhood recollections had surged up in his \nmind.

The perception \nwas subliminal, because the attention was en­\ngaged elsewhere, and the stimulus was not \nstrong enough to deflect it and to reach con­\nsciousness directly. Yet it had brought up the \n\"forgotten\" memories. \nSuch a \"cue\" or \"trigger\" effect can explain \nthe onset of neurotic symptoms as well as more \nbenign memories when a sight, smell, or sound \nrecalls a circumstance in the past.

Thus, among the \nlost memories, we encounter not a few that owe \ntheir subliminal state (and their incapacity to \nbe voluntarily reproduced) to their disagreeable \nand incompatible nature.

The former are derived \nfrom the ego personality; the latter, however, \narise from a source that is not identical with the \nego, but is its \"other side.\" It is this \"other side\" \nthat would have made the secretary forget the \ninvitations. \nThere are many reasons why we forget things \nthat we have noticed or experienced; and there-\nare just as many ways in which they may be \nrecalled to mind. An interesting example is that \nof cryptomnesia, or \"concealed recollection.\" \nAn author may be writing steadily to a precon­\nceived plan, working out an argument or de­\nveloping the line of a story, when he suddenly \nruns off at a tangent. Perhaps a fresh idea has \noccurred to him, or a different image, or a \nwhole new sub-plot. If you ask him what \nprompted the digression, he will not be able to \ntell you. He may not even have noticed the \nchange, though he has now produced material \nthat is entirely fresh and apparently unknown \nto him before. Yet it can sometimes be shown \nconvincingly that what he has written bears a \nstriking similarity to the work of another author \n—a work that he believes he has never seen. \nI myself found a fascinating example of this \nin Nietzsche's book Thus Spake £arathustra, \nwhere the author reproduces almost word for \nword an incident reported in a ship's log for \nthe year 1686. By sheer chance I had read this \nseaman's yarn in a book published about 1835 \n(half a century before Nietzsche wrote); and \nwhen I found the similar passage in Thus Spake \n^arathuslra, I was struck by its pecwliar style, \nwhich was different from Nietzsche's usual \nlanguage. I was convinced that Nietzsche must \nalso have seen the old book, though he made \nno reference to it. I wrote to his sister, who was \nstill alive, and she confirmed that she and her \nbrother had in fact read the book together \nwhen he was 11 years old. I think, from the \ncontext, it is inconceivable that Nietzsche had \nany idea that he was plagiarizing this story. I \nbelieve that fifty years later it had unexpectedly \nslipped into focus in his conscious mind. \nIn this type of case there is genuine, if unre­\nalized, recollection. Much the same sort of thing \nmay happen to a musician who has heard a \npeasant tune or popular song in childhood and \nfinds it cropping up as the theme of a sym­\nphonic movement that he is composing in adult \nlife. An idea or an image has moved back from \nthe unconscious into the conscious mind. \nWhat I have so far said about the uncon­\nscious is no more than a cursory sketch of the \nnature and functioning of this complex part of \nthe human psyche. But it should have indicated \nthe kind of subliminal material from which the \nsymbols of our dreams may be spontaneously \nproduced. This subliminal material can consist \nof all urges, impulses, and intentions: all per­\nceptions and intuitions; all rational or irrational \nthoughts, conclusions, inductions, deductions, \nand premises; and all varieties of feeling. Any \nor all of these ca#n take the form of partial, \ntemporary, or constant unconsciousness. \nSuch material has mostly become uncon­\nscious because — in a manner of speaking — \nthere is no room for it in the conscious mind. \nSome of one's thoughts lose their emotional \nenergy and become subliminal (that is to say, \nthey no longer receive so much of our conscious \nattention) because they have come to seem un­\ninteresting or irrelevant, or because there is \nsome reason why we wish to push them out of \nsight. \nIt is, in fact, normal and necessary for us to \n\"forget\" in this fashion, in order to make room \nin our conscious minds for new impressions and \nideas. If this did not happen, everything we \nexperienced would remain above the threshold \nof consciousness and our minds would become \nimpossibly cluttered. This phenomenon is so \nwidely recognized today that most people who \nknow anything about psychology take it for \ngranted. \nBut just as conscious contents can vanish \ninto the unconscious, new contents, which have \nnever yet been conscious, can arise from it. \nOne may have an inkling, for instance, that \nsomething is on the point of breaking into con­\nsciousness—that \"something is in the air,\" or \nthat one \"smells a rat.\" The discovery that the \n37"

A great deal ol contro­\nversial discussion has arisen around this point. \nBut it is a fact that, in addition to memories \nfrom a long-distant conscious past, completely \nnew thoughts and creative ideas can also pre­\nsent themselves from the unconscious thoughts \nand ideas that have never been conscious before. \nThey grow up from the dark depths of the \nmind like a lotus and form a most important \npart ol the subliminal psyche. \nWe find this in everyday life, where dilemmas \nare sometimes solved by the most surprising new \npropositions; many artists, philosophers, and \neven scientists owe some of their best ideas to \ninspirations that appear suddenly from the \nunconscious. The ability to teach a rich vein \nof such material and to translate it effectively \ninto philosophy, literature, music, or scientific \ndiscovery is one of the hallmarks of what is \ncommonly called genius. \nWe can find clear proof ol this fact in the \nhistory ol science itself, for example, the French \nmathematician Poincarc and the chemist \nKckulcowed important scientific discoveries (as \nthey themselves admit i to sudden pictorial \"re­\nvelations\" from the unconscious. The so-called \n\"mystical\" cxpcrienceofthc French philosopher \nDescartes involved a similar sudden revelation \nin which he saw in a flash the \"order of all \nsciences.\" The British author Robert Louis \nStevenson had spent years looking for a story \nthat would lit his \"strong sense of man's double \nbeing,\" when the plot of Dr. Jfkyll and Mr. \nHyde was suddenly revealed to him in a dream. \nI .ater I shall describe in more detail how such \nmaterial arises from the unconscious, and I shall \nexamine the form in which it is expressed. At \nthe moment I simply want to point out that the \ncapacity of the human psyche to produce such \nnew material is particularly significant when \none is dealing with dream symbolism, for I \nhave found again and again in my professional \nwork that the images and ideas that dreams \ncontain cannot possibly be explained solely in \nterms of memory.

Greek \nmanuscript.) He interpreted the \ndream to mean that the structure \nwas a closed carbon ring as on the \npage, far left, from his  Textbook \nof Organic Chemistry  (1861) \nRight, an ordinary European highway \nwith a familiar sign that means \n\"look out for animals crossing.\" \nBut the motorists (their shadows \nappear In the foreground as they \nleave their car) see an elephant, a \nrhinoceros, even a dinosaur. This \npainting of a dream (by the modern \nSwiss artist Erhard Jacoby) \naccurately depicts the apparently \nillogical, incoherent nature of \ndream imagery. \n|8\n\f\nThe function of dreams \nI have gone into some detail about the origins \nof our dream life, because it is the soil from \nwhich most symbols originally grow. Unfor­\ntunately, dreams are difficult to understand. As \nI have already pointed out, a dream is quite \nunlike a story told by the conscious mind. In \neveryday life one thinks out what one wants to \nsay, selects the most telling way of saying it, and \ntries to make one's remarks logically coherent. \nFor instance, an educated person will seek to \navoid a mixed metaphor because it may give a \nmuddled impression of his point. But dreams \nhave a different texture. Images that seem con­\ntradictory and ridiculous crowd in on the \ndreamer, the normal sense of time is lost, and \ncommonplace things can assume a fascinating \nor threatening aspect. \nIt may seem strange that the unconscious \nmind should order its material so differently \nfrom the seemingly disciplined pattern that we \ncan impose on our thoughts in waking life. Yet \nanyone who stops for a moment to recall a \ndream will be aware of this contrast, which is \nin fact one of the main reasons why the ordinary \nperson finds dreams so hard to understand. \nThey do not make sense in terms of his normal \nwaking experience, and therefore he is inclined \neither to disregard them or to confess that they \nbaffle him. \nPerhaps it may be easier to understand this \npoint if we first realize the fact that the ideas \nwith which we deal in our apparently disci­\nplined waking life are by no means as precise \nas we like to believe. On the contrary, their \nmeaning (and their emotional significance for \nus) becomes more imprecise the more closely \nwe examine them. The reason for this is that \nanything we have heard or experienced can \nbecome subliminal that is to say, can pass into \nthe unconscious. And even what we retain in \n39\n\f\nour conscious mind and can reproduce at will \nhas acquired an unconscious undertone that \nwill color the idea each time it is recalled. Our \nconscious impressions, in fact, quickly assume \nan element of unconscious meaning that is \npsychically significant for us, though we are not \nconsciously aware of the existence of this sub­\nliminal meaning or of the way in which it both \nextends and confuses the conventional meaning. \nOf course, such psychic undertones differ \nfrom one person to another. Each of us receives \nany abstract or general notion in the context of \nthe individual mind, and we therefore under­\nstand and apply it in our individual ways. \nWhen, in conversation, I use any such terms as \n\"'state,\" \"money,\" \"health,\" or \"society,\" I \nassume that my listeners understand more or \nless the same thing as I do. But the phrase \"more \nor less\" makes my point. Each word means \nsomething slightly different to each person, even \namong those who share the same cultural back­\nground. The reason for this variation is that a \ngeneral notion is received into an individual \ncontext and is therefore understood and applied \nin a slightly individual way. And the difference \nof meaning is naturally greatest when people \nhave widely different social, political, religious \nor psychological experiences. \nAs long as concepts are identical with mere \nwords, the variation is almost imperceptible and \nplays no practical role. But when an exact defi­\nnition or a careful explanation is needed, one \ncan occasionally discover the most amazing \nvariations, not only in the purely intellectual \nunderstanding of the term, but particularly in \nits emotional tone and its application. As a rule, \nthese variations are subliminal and therefore \nnever realized. v \nOne may tend to dismiss such differences as \nredundant or expendable nuances of meaning \nthat have little relevance to everyday needs. But \nthe fact that they exist shows that even the most \nmatter-of-fact contents of consciousness have a \npenumbra of uncertainty around them. Even \nthe most carefully defined philosophical or \nmathematical concept, which we are sure does \nnot contain more than we have put into it, is \nnevertheless more than we assume. It is a \npsychic event and as such partly unknowable. \nThe very numbers you use in counting are more \nthan you take them to be. They are at the same \ntime mythological elements (for the Pytha­\ngoreans, they were even divine); but you are \ncertainly unaware of this when you use numbers \nfor a practical purpose. \nEvery concept in our conscious mind, in \nshort, has its own psychic associations. While \nsuch associations may vary in intensity (accord­\ning to the relative importance of the concept to \nour whole personality, or according to the other \nideas and even complexes to which it is asso­\nciated in our unconscious), they are capable of \n4\"\n\f\nLe temps n'a point de rive. 1 930-39.

But in dream analysis, where \nthe psychologist is dealing with expressions of \nthe unconscious, they arc very relevant, for they \narc the almost invisible roots of our conscious \nthoughts. Thai is why commonplace objects or \nideas can assume such powerful psychic signifi­\ncance in a dream that we may awake seriously \ndisturbed, in spite of having dreamed of nothing \nworse than a locked room or a missed train. \nThe images produced in dreams are much \nmore picturesque and vivid than the concepts \nand experiences that arc their waking counter­\nparts. One ol the reasons for this is that, in a \ndream, such concepts can express their uncon­\nscious meaning. In our conscious thoughts, we \nrestrain ourselves within the limits of rational \nstatements statements that are much less color­\nful because we have stripped them of most of \ntheir psychic associations. \nI recall one dream ol im own that I found \ndifficult to interpret. In this dream, a certain \nman was trying to get behind me and jump on \nm\\ back. I knew nothing of this man except \nthat I was aware that he had somehow picked \nupa remark I had made and had twisted it into \na grotesque travesty of mv meaning. But I \ncould not sec the connection between this fact \nand his attempt in the dream to jump on me. \nIn my professional life, however, it has often \nhappened that someone has misrepresented \nwhat I have said so often that I have scarcely \nbothered to wonder whether this kind of mis­\nrepresentation makes me angry. Now there is a \ncertain value in keeping a conscious control \nover one's emotional reactions: and this. I soon \nrealized, was the point the dream had made. It \nhad taken an Austrian colloquialism and trans­\nlated it into a pictorial image. This phrase, \ncommon enough in ordinary speech, is Ihi \nkannst mir auj den Bucket steigen (You can \nclimb on my back), which means \"I don't care \nwhat you say about me.\" An American equiva­\nlent, which could easily appear in a similar \ndream, would be \"Go jump in the lake.\" \nOne could say that this dream picture was \nsymbolic, for it did not state the situation \ndirectly but expressed the point indirectly l>v \nmeans of a metaphor that I could not at first \nunderstand. When this happens as it so often \ndoes i it is not deliberate \"disguise\" by a dream; \nit simplv reflects the deficiencies in our under­\nstanding ofcmotionally charged pictorial langu­\nage.

The primitive, on the other hand, \nis still aware of these psychic properties; he \nendows animals, plants, or stones with powers \nthat we find strange and unacceptable. \nAn African jungle dweller, for instance, sees \na nocturnal creature by daylight and knows it \nto be a medicine man who has temporarily \ntaken its shape. Or he may regard it as the bush \nsoul or ancestral spirit of one of his tribe. A \ntree may play a vital part in the life of a primi­\ntive, apparently possessing for him its own soul \nand voice, and the man concerned will feel that \nhe shares its fate. There are some Indians in \nSouth America who will assure you that they \nare Red Arara parrots, though they are well \naware that they lack feathers, wings, and beaks. \nFor in the primitive's world things do not have \nthe same sharp boundaries they do in our \n\"rational\" societies. \nWhat psychologists call psychic identity, or \n\"mystical participation,\" has been stripped oir \nour world of things. But it is exactly this halo \nof unconscious associations that gives a colorful \nand fantastic aspect to the primitive's world. \nWe have lost it to such a degree that we do not \nrecognize it when we meet it again. With us \nsuch things are kept below the threshold; when \nthey occasionally reappear, we even insist that \nsomething is wrong. \nI have more than once been consulted by \nwell-educated and intelligent people who have \nhad peculiar dreams, fantasies, or even visions, \nwhich have shocked them deeply. They have \nassumed that no one who is in a sound state of \nmind could suffer from such things, and that \nanyone who actually sees a vision must be \npathologically disturbed. A theologian once told \nme that Ezekiel's visions were nothing more \nthan morbid symptoms, and that, when Moses \nand other prophets heard \"voices\" speaking to \nthem, they were suffering from hallucinations. \nYou can imagine the panic he felt when some­\nthing of this kind \"spontaneously\" happened to \nhim. We are so accustomed to the apparently \nrational nature of our world that we can \nscarcely imagine anything happening that can­\nnot be explained by common sense. The primi­\ntive man confronted by a shock of this kind \nwould not doubt his sanity; he would think of \nfetishes, spirits, or gods. \nYet the emotions that affect us are just the \nsame. In fact, the terrors that stem from our \nelaborate civilization may be far more threaten­\ning than those that primitive people attribute \nto demons. The attitude of modern civilized \nman sometimes reminds me of a psychotic \npatient in my clinic who was himself a doctor. \nOne morning I asked him how he was. He \nreplied that he had had a wonderful night dis­\ninfecting the whole of heaven with mercuric \nchloride, but that in the course of this thorough­\ngoing sanitary process he had found no trace of \nGod. Here we see a neurosis or something \nworse. Instead of God or the \"fear of God,\" \nthere is an anxiety neurosis or some kind of \nphobia. The emotion has remained the same, \nbut its object has changed both its name and \nnature for the worse. \nLeft, a witch doctor from \nCameroon wearing a lion mask.

Modern \n\"rational\" man has tried to cut \nhimself off from such psychic \nassociations (which nevertheless \nsurvive in the unconscious); to \nhim, a spade is a spade and a lion \nis only what the dictionary (right) \nsays it is. \n45\n\f\n46"

Something \nmore is needed to bring certain things home to \nus effectively enough to make us change our \nattitude and behavior. This is what \"dream \nlanguage\" does; its symbolism has so much \npsychic energy that we are forced to pay atten­\ntion to it. \nThere was, for instance, a lady who was well \nknown for her stupid prejudices and her stub­\nborn resistance to reasoned argument. One \ncould have argued with her all night to no \neffect; she would have taken not the slightest \nnotice. Her dreams, however, took a different \nline of approach.

Such things seduce us into following \nways that are unsuitable to our individuality. \nWhether or not we are aware of the effect they \nhave on our consciousness, it is disturbed by \nand exposed to them almost without defense. \nThis is especially the case with a person whose \nextraverted attitude of mind lays all the em­\nphasis upon external objects, or who harbors \nfeelings of inferiority and doubt concerning his \nown innermost personality. \nThe more that consciousness is influenced by \nprejudices, errors, fantasies, and infantile \nwishes, the more the already existing gap will \nwiden into a neurotic dissociation and lead to \na more or less artificial life, far removed from \nhealthy instincts, nature, and truth. \nLeft, two further visualizations \nof spirits: Top, hellish demons \ndescend on St. Anthony (a painting \nby the 16th-century German artist \nGrunewald).

Far right, \na cartoon from the Russian magazine \nKrokodilshows \"colonialism\" as \na demonic wolf being driven into \nthe sea by the flags of various \nindependent African nations. \n49\n\f\nThe general function of dreams is to try to \nrestore our psychological balance by producing \ndream material that re-establishes, in a subtle \nway, the total psychic equilibrium. This is what \nI call the complementary (or compensatory) \nrole of dreams in our psychic make-up. It ex­\nplains why people who have unrealistic ideas \nor too high an opinion of themselves, or who \nmake grandiose plans out of proportion to their \nreal capacities, have dreams of flying or falling. \nThe dream compensates for the deficiencies of \ntheir personalities, and at the same time il \nwarns them of the dangers in their present \ncourse. If the warnings of the dream are dis­\nregarded, real accidents may take their place. \nThe victim may fall downstairs or may have a \nmotor accident. \nI remember the case of a man who was inex­\ntricably involved in a number of shady affairs. \nHe developed an almost morbid passion for \ndangerous mountain climbing, as a sort of com­\npensation. He was seeking \"to get above him­\nself.\" In a dream one night, he saw himself \nstepping off the summit of a high mountain \ninto empty space. When he told me his dream, \nI instantly saw his danger and tried to empha­\nsize the warning and persuade him to restrain \nhimself. I even told him that the dream fore­\nshadowed his death in a mountain accident. It \nwas in vain. Six months later he \"stepped off \ninto space.\" A mountain guide watched him \nand a friend letting themselves down on a rope \nin a difficult place. The friend had found a \ntemporary foothold on a ledge, and the \ndreamer was following him down. Suddenly he \nlet go of the rope, according to the guide, \"as \nif he were jumping into the air.\" He fell upon \nhis friend, and both went down and were killed. \nAnother typical case was that of a lady who \nwas living above herself. She was high and \nmighty in her daily life, but she had shocking \ndreams, reminding her of all sorts of unsavory \nthings. When I discovered them, she indig­\nnantly refused to acknowledge them. The \ndreams then became menacing, and full of \nreferences to the walks she used to take by her­\nself in the woods, where she indulged in soulful \nfantasies. I saw her danger, but she would not \nlisten to my many warnings. Soon afterwards, \nshe was savagely attacked in the woods by a \nsexual pervert; but for the intervention of some \npeople who heard her screams, she would have \nbeen killed. \nThere was no magic in this. What her \ndreams had told me was that this woman had \na secret longing for such an adventure—just as \n50\n\f\nLeft, two influences to which an \nindividual's consciousness is \nsubjected: Advertising (a 1 960s \nAmerican advertisement stressing \n\"sociability\") and political \npropaganda (a French poster for \na 1962 referendum, urging a vote \nof \"yes\" but plastered with the \nopposition's \"no\"). These and other \ninfluences may cause us to live \nin ways unsuited to our individual \nnatures: and the psychic imbalance \nthat can follow must be compensated \nfor by the unconscious. \nThe lighthouse keeper, right (in \na cartoon by America's Roland B \nWilson), has apparently become \na little disturbed psychologically \nby his isolation His unconscious, \nin its compensatory function, has \nproduced a hallucinatory companion, \nto whom the keeper confesses (in \nthecartoon caption): \"Not only \nthat, Bill, but I caught myself \ntalking to myself again yesterday I\" \nThe Delphic oracle, below, being \nconsulted by King Aegeus of Athens \n(from a vase painting). \"Messages\" \nfrom the unconscious are often as \ncryptic and ambiguous as were the \noracle's utterances. \nthe mountain climber unconsciously sought the \nsatisfaction of finding a definite way out of his \ndifficulties. Obviously, neither of them expected \nthe stiff price involved: She had several bones \nbroken, and he paid with his life. \nThus dreams may sometimes announce cer­\ntain situations long before they actually happen. \nThis is not necessarily a miracle or a form of \nprecognition. Many crises in our lives have a \nlong unconscious history. We move toward \nthem step by step, unaware of the dangers that \nare accumulating. But what we consciously fail \nto see is frequently perceived by our uncon­\nscious, which can pass the information on \nthrough dreams. \nDreams may often warn us in this way; but \njust as often, it seems, they do not. Therefore, \nany assumption of a benevolent hand restrain­\ning us in time is dubious. Or, to state it more \npositively, it seems that a benevolent agency is \nsometimes at work and sometimes not. The \nmysterious hand may even point the way to \nperdition; dreams sometimes prove to be traps, \nor appear to be so. They sometimes behave like \nthe Delphic oracle that told King Croesus that \nif he crossed the Halys River he would destroy \na large kingdom. It was only after he had been \ncompletely defeated in battle after the crossing\n\f\nthat he discovered that the kingdom meant by \nthe oracle was his own! \nOne cannot afford to be naive in dealing \nwith dreams. They originate in a spirit that is \nnot quite human, but is rather a breath of \nnature —a spirit of the beautiful and generous \nas well as of the cruel goddess. If we want to \ncharacterize this spirit, we shall certainly get \ncloser to it in the sphere of ancient mythologies, \nor the fables of the primeval forest, than in the \nconsciousness of modern man. I am not deny­\ning that great gains have resulted from the \nevolution of civilized society. But these gains \nhave been made at the price of enormous losses, \nwhose extent we have scarcely begun to esti­\nmate. Part of the purpose of my comparisons \nbetween the primitive and the civilized states of \nman has been to show the balance of these \nlosses and gains. \nPrimitive man was much more governed by \nhis instincts than are his \"rational*\" modern de­\nscendants, who have learned to \"control\" them­\nselves. In this civilizing process, we have \nincreasingly divided our consciousness from the \ndeeper instinctive strata of the human psyche, \nand even ultimately from the somatic basis of \nthe psychic phenomenon. Fortunately, we have \nnot lost these basic instinctive strata; they re­\nmain part of the unconscious, even though \nthey may express themselves only in the form of \ndream images. These instinctive phenomena-\none may not, incidentally, always recognize \nthem for what they are, for their character is \nsymbolic play a vital part in what I have \ncalled the compensating function of dreams. \nFor the sake of mental stability and even \nphysiological health, the unconscious and the \nconscious must be integrally connected and thus \nmove on parallel lines. If they are split apart \nor \"dissociated,\" psychological disturbance fol­\nlows. In this respect, dream symbols are the \nessential message carriers from the instinctive to \nthe rational parts of the human mind, and their \ninterpretation enriches the poverty of conscious­\nness so that it learns to understand again the \nforgotten language of the instincts. \nOf course, people are bound to query this \nfunction, since its symbols so often pass un­\nnoticed or uncomprehended. In normal life, the \nunderstanding of dreams is often considered \nsuperfluous. I can illustrate this by my experi­\nence with a primitive tribe in East Africa. To \nmy amazement, these tribesmen denied that \nthey had any dreams. But through patient, in­\ndirect talks with them I soon found that they \nhad dreams just like everyone else, but that \nthey were convinced their dreams had no \nmeaning. \"Dreams of ordinary men mean \nnothing,\"' they told me. They thought that the \nonly dreams that mattered were those of chiefs \nand medicine men; these, which concerned the \nwelfare of the tribe, were highly appreciated. \nThe only drawback was that the chief and the \nmedicine man both claimed that they had \nceased having meaningful dreams. They dated \nthis change from the time that the British came \nto their country. The district commissioner \nthe British official in charge of them had \ntaken over the function of the \"great dreams\" \nthat had hitherto guided the tribe's behavior. \nWhen these tribesmen conceded that they did \nhave dreams, but thought them meaningless, \nthey were like the modern man who thinks that \na dream has no significance for him simply be­\ncause he does not understand it. But even a \ncivilized man can sometimes observe that a \ndream (which he may not even remember) can \nalter his mood for better or worse. The dream \n52\n\f\nhas been \"comprehended,\" but only in a sub­\nliminal way. And that is what usually happens. \nIt is only on the rare occasions when a dream \nis particularly impressive or repeats itself at \nregular intervals that most people consider an \ninterpretation desirable. \nHere I ought to add a word of warning \nagainst unintelligent or incompetent dream \nanalysis. There are some people whose mental \ncondition is so unbalanced that the interpreta­\ntion of their dreams can be extremely risky; in \nsuch a case, a very one-sided consciousness is \ncut off from a correspondingly irrational or \n\"crazy\" unconscious, and the two should not \nbe brought together without taking special \nprecautions. \nAnd, speaking more generally, it is plain fool­\nishness to believe in ready-made systematic \nguides to dream interpretation, as if one could \nsimply buy a reference book and look up a par­\nticular symbol. No dream symbol can be sepa­\nrated from the individual who dreams it, and \nthere is no definite or straightforward interpre­\ntation of any dream. Each individual varies so \nmuch in the way that his unconscious comple­\nments or compensates his conscious mind that \nit is impossible to be sure how far dreams and \ntheir symbols can be classified at all. \nIt is true that there are dreams and single \nsymbols (I should prefer to call them \"motifs\") \nthat are typical and often occur. Among such \nmotifs are falling, flying, being persecuted by \ndangerous animals or hostile men, being insuffi­\nciently or absurdly clothed in public places, \nbeing in a hurry or lost in a milling crowd, \nfighting with useless weapons or being wholly \ndefenseless, running hard yet getting nowhere. \nA typical infantile motif is the dream of grow­\ning infinitely small or infinitely big, or being \ntransformed from one to the other as you find \nit, for instance, in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Won­\nderland. But I must stress again that these are \nmotifs that must be considered in the context of \nthe dream itself, not as self-explanatory ciphers. \nThe recurring dream is a noteworthy pheno­\nmenon. There are cases in which people have \ndreamed the same dream from childhood into \nthe later years of adult life. A dream of this \nkind is usually an attempt to compensate for a \nparticular defect in the dreamer's attitude to \nlife; or it may date from a traumatic moment \nthat has left behind some specific prejudice. It \nmay also sometimes anticipate a future event \nof importance. \nI myself dreamed of a motif over several \nyears, in which I would \"discover\" a part of my \nhouse that I did not know existed. Sometimes \nit was the quarters where my long-dead parents \nlived, in which my father, to my surprise, had \na laboratory where he studied the comparative \nLeft, a photograph of Jung (fourth \nfrom the right) in 1926 with the \ntribesmen of Mt. Elgon, Kenya. \nJung's firsthand study of primitive \nsocieties led to many of his most \nvaluable psychological insights. \nRight, two dream books—one from \n20th-century Britain and the other \nfrom ancient Egypt (the latter is \namong the oldest written documents \nextant, c. 2000 B.C.). Such ready-\nmade, rule-of-thumb interpretation \nof dreams is worthless; dreams are \nhighly individualized, and their \nsymbolism cannot be pigeonholed. \n53\n\f\nanatomy offish and my mother ran a hotel for \nghostly visitors. Usually this unfamiliar guest \nwing was an ancient historical building, long \nforgotten, yet my inherited property. It con­\ntained interesting antique furniture, and toward \nthe end of this series of dreams I discovered an \nold library whose books were unknown to me. \nFinally, in the last dream, I opened one of the \nbooks and found in it a profusion of the most \nmarvelous symbolic pictures. When I awoke, \nmy heart was palpitating with excitement. \nSome time before I had this particular last \ndream of the series, I had placed an order with \nan antiquarian bookseller for one of the classic \ncompilations of medieval alchemists. I had \nfound a quotation in literature that I thought \nmight have some connection with early Byzan­\ntine alchemy, and I wished to check it. Several \nweeks after I had had the dream of the un­\nknown book, a parcel arrived from the book­\nseller. Inside was a parchment volume dating \nfrom the 16th century. It was illustrated by \nfascinating symbolic pictures that instantly re­\nminded me of those I had seen in my dream. \nAs the rediscovery of the principles of alchemy \ncame to be an important part of my work as a \npioneer of psychology, the motif of my recur­\nring dream can easily be understood. The \nhouse, of course, was a symbol of my person­\nality and its conscious field of interests; and the \nunknown annex represented the anticipation of \na new field of interest and research of which my \nconscious mind was at that time unaware. From \nthat moment, 30 years ago, I never had the \ndream again. \nTop of page, a famous example of \nthe common dream of growing larger: \na drawing from  Alice in Wonderland \n(1 877) shows Alice growing to fill \na house. Center, the equally common \ndream of flying, in a 1 9th-century \ndrawing (by the British artist \nWilliam Blake) entitled: \"0, How \nI Dreamt of Things Impossible.\" \n54\n\f\nThe analysis of dreams \nI began this essay by noting the difference be­\ntween a sign and a symbol. The sign is always \nless than the concept it represents, while a sym­\nbol always stands for something more than its \nobvious and immediate meaning. Symbols, \nmoreover, are natural and spontaneous pro­\nducts. No genius has ever sat down with a pen \nor a brush in his hand and said: \"Now I am \ngoing to invent a symbol.\" No one can take a \nmore or less rational thought, reached as a logi­\ncal conclusion or by deliberate intent, and then \ngive it \"symbolic\" form. No matter what fan­\ntastic trappings one may put upon an idea of \nthis kind, it will still remain a sign, linked to \nthe conscious thought behind it, not a symbol \nthat hints at something not yet known. In \ndreams, symbols occur spontaneously, for \ndreams happen and are not invented; they are, \ntherefore, the main source of all our knowledge \nabout symbolism. \nBut symbols, I must point out, do not occur \nsolely in dreams. They appear in all kinds of \npsychic manifestations. There are symbolic \nthoughts and feelings, symbolic acts and situa­\ntions. It often seems that even inanimate objects \nco-operate with the unconscious in the arrange­\nment of symbolic patterns. There arc numerous \nwell-authenticated stories of clocks stopping at \nthe moment of their owner's death; one was \nthe pendulum clock in the palace of Frederick \nthe Great at Sans Souci, which stopped when \nthe king died. Other common examples are \nthose of a mirror that breaks, or a picture that \nfalls, when a death occurs; or minor but unex­\nplained breakages in a house where someone is \npassing through an emotional crisis. Even if \nskeptics refuse to credit such reports, stories of \nthis kind are always cropping up, and this alone \nshould serve as ample proof of their psycho­\nlogical importance. \nThere are many symbols, however (among \nthem the most important), that are not indi­\nvidual but collective in their nature and origin. \nThese are chiefly religious images. The believer \nassumes that they are of divine origin — that \nthey have been revealed to man. The skeptic \nsays flatly that they have been invented. Both \nare wrong. It is true, as the skeptic notes, that \nreligious symbols and concepts have for cen­\nturies been the object of careful and quite con­\nscious elaboration. It is equally true, as the be­\nliever implies, that their origin is so far buried \nin the mystery of the past that they seem to \nhave no human source. But they are in fact \n\"collective representations,\" emanating from \nprimeval dreams and creative fantasies. As \nsuch, these images are involuntary spontaneous \nmanifestations and by no means intentional \ninventions. \nThis fact, as I shall later explain, has a direct \nand important bearing upon the interpretation \nof dreams. It is obvious that if you assume the \nInanimate objects sometimes seem \nto \"act\" symbolically: left, the \nclock of Frederick the Great, which \nstopped when its owner died in 1786. \nSymbols are produced spontaneously \nfrom the unconscious (though they \nmay later be consciously elaborated). \nRight, the  ankh,  ancient Egypt's \nsymbol of life, the universe, and \nman. By contrast, the airways \ninsignia (far right) are consciously \ncontrived signs, not symbols. \n55\n\f\ndream to be symbolic, you will interpret it dif­\nferently from a person who believes that the \nessential energizing thought or emotion is \nknown already and is merely \"disguised\" by the \n'dream. In the latter case, dream interpretation \nmakes little sense, for you find only what you \nalready know. \nIt is for this reason that I have always said \nto my pupils: \"Learn as much as you can \nabout symbolism; then forget it all when you \nare analyzing a dream.\" This advice is of such \npractical importance that I have made it a rule \nto remind myself that I can never understand \nsomebody else's dream well enough to interpret \nil correctly. I have done this in order to check \nthe flow of my own associations and reactions, \nwhich might otherwise prevail over my patient's \nuncertainties and hesitations. As it is of the \ngreatest therapeutic importance for an analyst \nto get the particular message of a dream (that \nis, the contribution that the unconscious is mak­\ning to the conscious mind) as accurately as pos­\nsible, it is essential for him to explore the con­\ntent of a dream with the utmost thoroughness. \nI had a dream when I was working with \nFreud that illustrates this point. I dreamed that \nI was in \"my home,\" apparently on the first \nfloor, in a cosy, pleasant sitting room furnished \nin the manner of the 18th century. I was aston­\nished that I had never seen this room before, \nand began to wonder what the ground floor \nwas like. I went downstairs and found the place \nwas rather dark, with paneled walls and heavy \nfurniture dating from the 16th century or even \nearlier. My surprise and curiosity increased. I \nwanted to see more of the whole structure of \nthis house. So I went down to the cellar, where \nI found a door opening onto a flight of stone \nsteps that led to a large vaulted room. The floor \nconsisted of large slabs of stone and the walls \nseemed very ancient. I examined the mortar \nand found it was mixed with splinters of brick. \nObviously the walls were of Roman origin. I \nbecame increasingly excited. In one corner, I \nsaw an iron ring on a stone slab. I pulled up \nthe slab and saw yet another narrow flight of \nsteps leading to a kind of cave, which seemed \nto be a prehistoric tomb, containing two skulls, \nsome bones, and broken shards of pottery. Then \nI woke up. \nIf Freud, when he analyzed this dream, had \nfollowed my method of exploring its specific \nassociations and context, he would have heard \na far-reaching story. But I am afraid he would \nhave dismissed it as a mere effort to escape \nfrom a problem that was really his own. The \ndream is in fact a short summary of my life, \nmore specifically of the development of my \nmind. I grew up in a house 200 years old, our \nfurniture consisted mostly of pieces about 300 \nyears old, and mentally my hitherto greatest \nspiritual adventure had been to study the philo­\nsophies of Kant and Schopenhauer. The great \nnews of the day was the work of Charles Dar­\nwin. Shortly before this, I had been living with \nthe still medieval concepts of my parents, for \nRight, Jung's mother and father. \nJung's interest in ancient religion \nand mythology drew him away from \nthe religious world of his parents \n(hisfather wasa pastor)—as \nshown by the dream, discussed \non this page, that he had while \nworking with Freud. Far right, \nJung at Burghblzli Hospital, Zurich, \nwhere he worked in 1 900 as a \npsychiatrist. \n56\n\f\nwhom the world and men were still presided \nover by divine omnipotence and providence. \nThis world had become antiquated and obso­\nlete. My Christian faith had become relative \nthrough its encounter with Eastern religions \nand Greek philosophy. It is for this reason that \nthe ground floor was so still, dark, and obvi­\nously uninhabited. \nMy then historical interests had developed \nfrom an original preoccupation with compara­\ntive anatomy and paleontology while I was \nworking as an assistant at the Anatomical In­\nstitute. I was fascinated by the bones of fossil \nman, particularly by the much discussed Nean-\nderthalensis and the still more controversial \nskull of Dubois' Pithecanthropus. As a matter \nof fact these were my real associations to the \ndream; but I did not dare to mention the sub­\nject of skulls, skeletons, or corpses to Freud, \nbecause I had learned that this theme was not \npopular with him. He cherished the peculiar \nidea that I anticipated his early death. And he \ndrew this conclusion from the fact that I had \nshown much interest in the mummified corpses \nin the so-called Bleikeller in Bremen, which we \nvisited together in 1909 on our way to take the \nboat to America. \nThus I felt reluctant to come out with my \nown thoughts, since through recent experience \nI was deeply impressed by the almost unbridge-\n• able gap between Freud's mental outlook and \nbackground and my own. I was afraid of losing \nhis friendship if I should open up to him about \nmy own inner world, which, I surmised, would \nlook very queer to him. Feeling quite uncertain \nabout my own psychology, I almost automati­\ncally told him a lie about my \"free associations\" \nin order to escape the impossible task of enlight­\nening him about my very personal and utterly \ndifferent constitution. \nI must apologize for this rather lengthy nar­\nration of the jam I got into through telling \nFreud my dream. But it is a good example of \nthe difficulties in which one gets involved in \nthe course of a real dream analysis. So much \ndepends upon the personal differences between \nthe analyst and the analyzed. \nI soon realized that Freud was looking for \nsome incompatible wish of mine. And so I sug­\ngested tentatively that the skulls I had dreamed \nof might refer to certain members of my family \nwhose death, for some reason, I might desire. \nThis proposal met with his approval, but I was \nnot satisfied with such a \"phoney\" solution. \nWhile I was trying to find a suitable answer \nto Freud's questions, I was suddenly confused \nby an intuition about the role that the subjec­\ntive factor plays in psychological understand­\ning. My intuition was so overwhelming that I \nthought only of how to get out of this impos­\nsible snarl, and I took the easy way out by a \nlie. This was neither elegant nor morally defen­\nsible, but otherwise I should have risked a fatal \nrow with Freud — and I did not feel up to that \nfor many reasons. \nMy intuition consisted of the sudden and \nmost unexpected insight into the fact that my \ndream meant myself, my life and my world, my \nwhole reality against a theoretical structure \nerected by another, strange mind for reasons \nand purposes of its own. It was not Freud's \ndream , it was mine; and I understood suddenly \nin a flash what my dream meant. \nThis conflict illustrates a vital point about \ndream analysis. It is not so much a technique \nthat can be learned and applied according to \nthe rules as it is a dialectical exchange between \ntwo personalities. If it is handled as a mechani­\ncal technique, the individual psychic person­\nality of the dreamer gets lost and the thera­\npeutic problem is reduced to the simple ques-\n57\n\f\ntion: Which of the two people concerned —the \nanalyst or the dreamer—will dominate the \nother? I gave up hypnotic treatment for this \nvery reason, because I did not want to impose \nmy will on others. I wanted the healing pro­\ncesses to grow out of the patient's own person­\nality, not from suggestions by me that would \nhave only a passing effect. My aim was to pro­\ntect and preserve my patient's dignity and free­\ndom, so that he could live his life according to \nhis own wishes. In this exchange with Freud, it \ndawned on me for the first time that before we \nconstruct general theories about man and his \npsyche we should learn a lot more about the \nreal human being we have to deal with. \nThe individual is the only reality. The further \nwe move away from the individual toward ab­\nstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely \nwe are to fall into error. In these times of social \nupheaval and rapid change, it is desirable to \nknow much more than we do about the indi­\nvidual human being, for so much depends upon \nhis mental and moral qualities. But if we are \nto see things in their right perspective, we need \nto understand the past of man as well as his \npresent. That is why an understanding of myths \nand symbols is of essential importance. \nThe problem of types \nIn all other branches of science, it is legitimate \nto apply a hypothesis to an impersonal subject. \nPsychology, however, inescapably confronts \nyou with the living relations between two indi­\nviduals, neither of whom can be divested of his \nsubjective personality, nor, indeed, depersonal­\nized in any other way. The analyst and his \npatient may set out by agreeing to deal with a \nchosen problem in an impersonal and objective \nmanner; but once they are engaged, their \nwhole personalities are involved in their discus­\nsion. At this point, further progress is. possible \nonly if mutual agreement can be reached. \nCan we make any sort of objective judgment \nabout the final result? Only if we make a com­\nparison between our conclusions and the stan­\ndards that are generally valid in the social \nmilieu to which the individuals belong. Even \nthen, we must take into account the mental \nequilibrium (or \"sanity\") of the individual con­\ncerned. For the result cannot be a completely \ncollective leveling out of the individual to \nAn assertive extravert overpowers \na withdrawn introvert in a cartoon \nby America's Jules Feiffer. These \nJungian terms for human \"types\" \nare not dogmatic: For instance, \nGandhi, right, was both an ascetic \n(introvert) and a political leader \n(extravert). An individual—any face \nin the crowd (far right) —can only \nmore or less  be categorized.\n\f\nadjust him to the \"norms\" of his society. This \nwould amount to a most unnatural condition. \nA sane and normal society is one in which \npeople habitually disagree, because general \nagreement is relatively rare outside the sphere \nof instinctive human qualities. \nDisagreement functions as a vehicle of \nmental life in society, but it is not a goal; agree­\nment is equally important. Because psychology \nbasically depends upon balanced opposites, no \njudgment can be considered to be final in \nwhich its reversibility has not been taken into \naccount. The reason for this peculiarity lies in \nthe fact that there is no standpoint above or \noutside psychology that would enable us to \nform an ultimate judgment of what the \npsyche is. \nIn spite of the fact that dreams demand indi­\nvidual treatment, some generalities are neces­\nsary in order to classify and clarify the material \nthat the psychologist collects by studying many \nindividuals. It would obviously be impossible to \nformulate any psychological theory, or to teach \nit, by describing large numbers of separate cases \nwithout any effort to see what they have in \ncommon and how they differ. Any general \ncharacteristic can be chosen as a basis. One \ncan, for instance, make a relatively simple dis­\ntinction between individuals who have \"extra-\nverted\" personalities and others who are \"intro­\nverted.\" This is only one of many possible \ngeneralizations, but it enables one to see imme­\ndiately the difficulties that can arise if the ana­\nlyst should happen to be one type and his \npatient the other. \nSince any deeper analysis of dreams leads to \nthe confrontation of two individuals, it will \nobviously make a great difference whether their \ntypes of attitude are the same or not. If both \nbelong to the same type, they may sail along \nhappily for a long time. But if one is an extra­\nvert and the other an introvert, their different \nand contradictory standpoints may clash right \naway, particularly when they are unaware of \n59\n\f\ntheir own type of personality, or when they \nare convinced that their own is the only right \ntype. The extravert, for instance, will choose \nthe majority view; the introvert will reject it \nsimply because it is fashionable. Such a mis­\nunderstanding is easy enough because the value \nof the one is the non-value of the other. Freud \nhimself, for instance, interpreted the introverted \ntype as an individual morbidly concerned with \nhimself. But introspection and self-knowledge \ncan just as well be of the greatest value and \nimportance. \nIt is vitally necessary to take account of such \ndifferences of personality in dream interpreta­\ntion. It cannot be assumed that the analyst is a \nsuperman who is above such differences, just \nbecause he is a doctor who has acquired a \npsychological theory and a corresponding tech­\nnique. He can only imagine himself to be \nsuperior in so far as he assumes that his theory \nand technique are absolute truths, capable of \nembracing the whole of the human psyche. \nSince such an assumption is more than doubt­\nful, he cannot really be sure of it. Consequently, \nhe will be assailed by secret doubts if he con­\nfronts the human wholeness of his patient with \na theory or technique (which is merely a hypo­\nthesis or an attempt) instead of with his own \nliving wholeness. \nThe analyst's whole personality is the only \nadequate equivalent of his patient's personality. \nPsychological experience and knowledge do not \nThe \"compass\" of the psyche— \nanother Jungian way of looking at \npeople in general. Each point on the \ncompass has its opposite: for a \n\"thinking\" type, the \"feeling\" side \nwould be least developed. (\"Feeling\" \nhere means the faculty of weighing \nand evaluating experience—in the \nway that one might say \"I  feel  that is \na good thing to do,\" without needing \nto analyze or rationalize the \"why\" \nof '.he action.) Of course, there is \noverlapping in each individual: In \na \"sensation\" person the thinking \nor the feeling side could be almost \nas strong (and \"intuition,\" the \nopposite, would be weakest). \nGo \namount to more than mere advantages on the \nside of the analyst. They do not keep him out­\nside the fray, in which he is bound to be tested \njust as much as his patient. Thus it matters a \ngood deal whether their personalities are har­\nmonious, in conflict, or complementary. \nFxtravcrsion and introversion are just two \namong many peculiarities of human behavior. \nBut they arc often rather obvious and easily \nrecognizable. If one studies extraverted indi­\nviduals, for instance, one soon discovers that \nthey differ in many ways from one another, \nand that being extraverted is therefore a super­\nficial and too general criterion to be really \ncharacteristic. That is why, long ago, I tried to \nfind some further basic peculiarities peculiari­\nties that might serve the purpose of giving some \norder to the apparently limitless variations in \nhuman individuality. \nI had always been impressed by the fact that \nthere are a surprising number of individuals \nwho never use their minds if they can avoid it, \nand an equal number who do use their minds, \nbut in an amazingly stupid way. I was also \nsurprised to find many intelligent and wide­\nawake people who lived (as far as one could \nmake out) as if they had never learned to use \ntheir sense organs: They did not see the things \nbefore their eyes, hear the words sounding in \ntheir ears, or notice the things they touched or \ntasted. Some lived without being aware of the \nstate of their own bodies.\n\f\nThere were others who seemed to live in a \nmost curious condition of consciousness, as if \nthe state they had arrived at today were final, \nwith no possibility of change, or as if the world \nand the psyche were static and would remain \nso forever. They seemed devoid of all imagina­\ntion, and they entirely and exclusively de­\npended upon their sense-perception. Chances \nand possibilities did not exist in their world, \nand in \"today\" there was no real \"tomorrow.\" \nThe future was just the repetition of the past. \nI am trying here to give the reader a glimpse \nof my own first impressions when I began to \nobserve the many people I met. It soon became \nclear to me, however, that the people who used \ntheir minds were those who thought — that is, \nwho applied their intellectual faculty in trying \nto adapt, themselves to people and circum­\nstances. And the equally intelligent people who \ndid not think were those who sought and found \ntheir way by feeling. \n\"Feeling\" is a word that needs some explana­\ntion. For instance, one speaks of \"feeling\" when \nit is a matter of \"sentiment\" (corresponding to \nthe French term sentiment). But one also \napplies the same word to define an opinion; \nfor example, a communication from the White \nHouse may begin: \"The President feels . . . .\" \nFurthermore, the word may be used to express \nan intuition: \"I had a feeling as if. . . .\" \nWhen I use the word \"feeling\" in contrast \nto \"thinking,\" I refer to a judgment of value — \nfor instance, agreeable or disagreeable, good or \nbad, and so on. Feeling according to this defi­\nnition is not an emotion (which, as the word \nconveys, is involuntary). Feeling as I mean it is \n(like thinking) a rational (i.e. ordering) func­\ntion, whereas intuition is an irrational (i.e. \nperceiving) function. In so far as intuition is a \n\"hunch,\" it is not the product of a voluntary \nact; it is rather an involuntary event, which \ndepends upon different external or internal cir­\ncumstances instead of an act of judgment. \nIntuition is more like a sense-perception, which \nis also an irrational event in so far as it de­\npends essentially upon objective stimuli, which \nowe their existence to physical and not to \nmental causes. \nThese four functional types correspond to the \nobvious means by which consciousness obtains \nits orientation to experience. Sensation (i.e. \nsense-perception) tells you that something \nexists; thinking tells you what it is; feeling tells \nyou whether it is agreeable or not; and intuition \ntells you whence it comes and where it is going. \nThe reader should understand that these \nfour criteria of types of human behavior are \njust four viewpoints among many others, like \nwill power, temperament, imagination, mem­\nory, and so on. There is nothing dogmatic about \nthem, but their basic nature recommends them \nas suitable criteria for a classification. I find \nthem particularly helpful when I am called \nupon to explain parents to children and hus­\nbands to wives, and vice versa. They are also \nuseful in understanding one's own prejudices. \nThus, if you want to understand another \nperson's dream, you have to sacrifice your own \npredilections and suppress your prejudices. This \nis not easy or comfortable, because it means a \nmoral effort that is not to everyone's taste. But \nif the analyst does not make the effort to criti­\ncize his own standpoint (and to admit its rela­\ntivity, he will get neither the right information \nabout, nor sufficient insight into, his patient's \nmind. The analyst expects at least a certain \nwillingness on the patient's part to listen to his \nopinion and to take it seriously, and the patient \nmust be granted the same right. Although such \na relationship is indispensable for any under­\nstanding and is therefore of self-evident neces­\nsity, one must remind oneself again and again \nthat it is more important in therapy for the \npatient to understand than for the analyst's \ntheoretical expectations to be satisfied. The \npatient's resistance to the analyst's interpreta­\ntion is not necessarily wrong; it is rather a sure \nsign that something does not \"click.\" Either the \npatient has not yet reached the point where he \nunderstands, or the interpretation does not fit. \nIn our efforts to interpret the dream symbols \nof another person, we are almost invariabl \nhampered by our tendency to fill in the un­\navoidable gaps in our understanding by pro­\njection that is, by the assumption that what \nthe analyst perceives or thinks is equally per-\n6i\n\f\nceived or thought by the dreamer. To overcome \nthis source of error, I have always insisted on \nthe importance of sticking to the context of the \nparticular dream and excluding all theoretical \nassumptions about dreams in general—except \nfor the hypothesis that dreams in some way \nmake sense. \nIt will be clear from all I have said that we \ncannot lay down general rules for interpreting \ndreams. When I suggested earlier that the over­\nall function of dreams seems to be to compen­\nsate for deficiencies or distortions in the \nconscious mind, I meant that this assumption \nopened up the most promising approach to the \nnature of particular dreams. In some cases you \ncan see this function plainly demonstrated. \nOne of my patients had a very high opinion \nof himself and was unaware that almost every­\none who knew him was irritated by his air of \nmoral superiority. He came to me with a dream \nin which he had seen a drunken tramp rolling \nin a ditch — a sight that evoked from him only \nthe patronizing comment: \"It's terrible to see \nhow low a man can fall.\" It was evident that \nthe unpleasant nature of the dream was at \nleast in part an attempt to offset his inflated \nopinion of his own merits. But there was some­\nthing more to it than this. It turned out that \nhe had a brother who was a degenerate alco­\nholic. What the dream also revealed was that \nhis superior attitude was compensating the \nbrother, as both an outer and an inner figure. \nIn another case I recall, a woman who was \nproud of her intelligent understanding of \npsychology had recurringdreams about another \nwoman. When in ordinary life she met this \nwoman, she did not like her, thinking her a \nvain and dishonest intriguer. But in the dreams \nthe woman appeared almost as a sister, friendly \nand likeable. My patient could not understand \nwhy she should dream so favorably about a \nperson she disliked. But these dreams were try­\ning to convey the idea that she herself was \n\"shadowed\" by an unconscious character that \nresembled the other woman. It was hard for \nmy patient, who had very clear ideas about her \nown personality, to realize that the dream was \ntelling her about her own power complex and \nher hidden motivations — unconscious influen­\nces that had more than once led to disagreeable \nrows with her friends. She had always blamed \nothers for these, not herself. \nIt is not merely the \"shadow\" side of our per­\nsonalities that we overlook, disregard, and re­\npress. We may also do the same to our positive \nqualities. An example that comes to mind is \nthat of an apparently modest and self-effacing \nman, with charming manners. He always \nseemed content with a back seat, but discreetly \ninsisted on being present. When asked to speak \nhe would offer a well-informed opinion, though \nhe never intruded it. But he sometimes hinted \nthat a given matter could be dealt with in a \nfar superior way at a certain higher level \n(though he never explained how). \nIn his dreams, however, he constantly had \nencounters with great historical figures, such \nas Napoleon and Alexander the Great. These \ndreams were clearly compensating for an in­\nferiority complex. But they had another impli­\ncation. What sort of man must I be, the dream \nwas asking, to have such illustrious callers? In \nthis respect the dreams pointed to a secret meg-\n62\n\f\nalomania, which offset the dreamer's feeling of \ninferiority. This unconscious idea of grandeur \ninsulated him from the reality of his environ­\nment and enabled him to remain aloof from \nobligations that would be imperative for other \npeople. He felt no need to prove — either to \nhimself or to others — that his superior judg­\nment was based on superior merit. \nHe was, in fact, unconsciously playing an \ninsane game, and the dreams were seeking to \nbring it to the level of consciousness in a curi­\nously ambiguous way. Hobnobbing with Napo­\nleon and being on speaking terms with \nAlexander the Great are exactly the kind of \nfantasies produced by an inferiority complex. \nBut why, one asks, could not the dream be \nopen and direct about it and say what it had \nto say without ambiguity? \nI have frequently been asked this question, \nand I have asked it myself. I am often surprised \nat the tantalizing way dreams seem to evade \ndefinite information or omit the decisive point. \nFreud assumed the existence of a special func­\ntion of the psyche, which he called the \"cen­\nsor.\" This, he supposed, twisted the dream \nimages and made them unrecognizable or mis­\nleading in order to deceive the dreaming con­\nsciousness about the real subject of the dream. \nBy concealing the critical thought from the \ndreamer, the \"censor\" protected his sleep \nagainst the shock of a disagreeable reminiscence. \nBut I am skeptical about the theory that the \ndream is a guardian of sleep; dreams just as \noften disturb sleep. \nIt rather looks as if the approach to con­\nsciousness has a \"blotting-out\" effect upon the \nsubliminal contents of the psyche. The sublimi­\nnal state retains ideas and images at a much \nlower level of tension than they possess in con­\nsciousness. In the subliminal condition they \nlose clarity of definition; the relations between \nthem are less consequential and more vaguely \nanalogous, less rational and therefore more \"in­\ncomprehensible.\" This can also be observed in \nall dreamlike conditions, whether due to \nfatigue, fever, or toxins. But if something hap­\npens to endow any of these images with greater \ntension, they become less subliminal and, as \nthey come close to the threshold of conscious­\nness, more sharply defined. \nLeft, a down-and-out alcoholic in \na New York slum (from the 1 955 film \nOn the Bowery).  Such a figure might \nappear in the dreams of a man who \nfelt himself to be superior to \nothers. In this way his unconscious \nwould be compensating for his \nconscious mind's onesidedness. \nRight,  The Nightmare,  painted by \nthe 18th-century Swiss-born artist \nHenry Fuseli. Almost everyone has \nbeen awakened, upset, or disturbed \nby his dreams; our sleep does not \nappear to be protected from the \ncontents of the unconscious."

    "raw_text": "It is from this fact that one may understand \nwhy dreams often express themselves as analo­\ngies, why one dream image slides into another, \nand why neither the logic nor the time scale \nof our waking life seems to apply. The form \nthat dreams take is natural to the unconscious \nbecause the material from which they are pro­\nduced is retained in the subliminal state in pre­\ncisely this fashion. Dreams do not guard sleep \nfrom what Freud called the \"incompatible \nwish.\" What he called \"disguise\" is actually \nthe shape all \"impulses naturally take in the \nunconscious. Thus, a dream cannot produce a \ndefinite thought. If it begins to do so, it ceases \nto be a dream because it crosses the threshold \nof consciousness. That is why dreams seem to \nskip the very points that are most important to \nthe conscious mind, and seem rather to mani­\nfest the \"fringe of consciousness,\" like the faint \ngleam of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. \nWe should understand that dream symbols \nare for the most part manifestations of a psyche \nthat is beyond the control of the conscious \nmind. Meaning and purposefulness are not the \nprerogatives of the mind; they operate in the \nwhole of living nature. There is no difference \nin principle between organic and psychic \ngrowth. As a plant produces its flower, so the \npsyche creates its symbols. Every dream is \nevidence of this process. \nSo, by means of dreams (plus all sorts of \nintuitions, impulses, and other spontaneous \nevents), instinctive forces influence the activity \nof consciousness. Whether that influence is for \nbetter or for worse depends upon the actual \ncontents of the unconscious. If it contains too \nmany things that normally ought to be con­\nscious, then its function becomes twisted and \nprejudiced; motives appear that are not based \nupon true instincts, but that owe their exist­\nence and psychic importance to the fact that \nthey have been consigned to the unconscious by \nrepression or neglect. They overlay, as it were, \nthe normal unconscious psyche and distort its \nnatural tendency to express basic symbols and \nmotifs. Therefore it is reasonable for a psycho­\nanalyst, concerned with the causes of a mental \ndisturbance, to begin by eliciting from his \npatient a more or less voluntary confession and \nrealization of everything that the patient dis­\nlikes or fears. \nThis is like the much older confession of the \nChurch, which in many ways anticipated \nmodern psychological techniques. At least this \nis the general rule. In practice, however, it may \nwork the other way round; overpowering feel­\nings of inferiority or serious weakness may make \nit very difficult, even impossible, for the patient \nto face fresh evidence of his own inadequacy. \nSo I have often found it profitable to begin by \ngiving a positive outlook to the patient; this \nprovides a helpful sense of security when he \napproaches the more painful insights. \nTake as an example a dream of \"personal \nexaltation\" in which, for instance, one has tea \nwith the queen of England, or finds oneself on \nintimate terms with the pope. If the dreamer \nis not a schizophrenic, the practical interpreta­\ntion of the symbol depends very much upon his \npresent state of mind — that is, the condition of \nhis ego. If the dreamer overestimates his own \nvalue, it is easy to show (from the material pro­\nduced by association of ideas) how inappropri­\nate and childish the dreamer's intentions are, \nand how much they emanate from childish \nwishes to be equal to or superior to his parents. \nBut if it is a case of inferiority, where an all-\npervading feeling of worthlessness has already \novercome every positive aspect of the dreamer's \npersonality, it would be quite wrong to depress \nhim still more by showing how infantile, ridicu­\nlous, or even perverse he is. That would cruelly \nincrease his inferiority, as well as cause an \nunwelcome and quite unnecessary resistance to \nthe treatment. \nThere is no therapeutic technique or doctrine \nthat is of general application, since every case \nthat one receives for treatment is an individual \nin a specific condition. I remember a patient I \nonce had to treat over a period of nine years. \nRight, the heroic dreams with which \nWalter Mitty (in the 1947 film of \nJamesThurber's story) compensates \nhis sense of inferiority. \n64\n\f\nI saw him only for a few weeks each year, since \nhe lived abroad. From the start I knew what his \nreal trouble was, but I also saw that the least \nattempt to get close to the truth was met by a \nviolent defensive reaction that threatened a \ncomplete rupture between us. Whether I liked \nit or not, I had to do my best to maintain our \nrelation and to follow his inclination, which was \nsupported by his dreams and which led our \ndiscussion away from the root of his neurosis. \nWe ranged so widely that I often accused myself \nof leading my patient astray. Nothing but the \nfact that his condition slowly but clearly \nimproved prevented me from confronting him \nbrutally with the truth. \nIn the 10th year, however, the patient de­\nclared himself to be cured and freed from all \nhis symptoms. I was surprised because theoreti­\ncally his condition was incurable. Noticing my \nastonishment, he smiled and said (in effect): \n\"And I want to thank you above all for your \nunfailing tact and patience in helping me to \ncircumvent the painful cause of my neurosis. \nI am now ready to tell you everything about it. \nIf I had been able to talk freely about it, I \nwould have told you what it was at my first \nconsultation. But that would have destroyed \nmy rapport with you. Where should I have been \nthen? I should have been morally bankrupt. In \nthe course of 10 years I have learned to trust \nyou; and as my confidence grew, my condi­\ntion improved. I improved because this slow \nprocess restored my belief in myself. Now I am \nstrong enough to discuss the problem that was \ndestroying me.\" \nHe then made a devastatingly frank confes­\nsion of his problem, which showed me the reas­\nons for the peculiar course our treatment had \nhad to follow. The original shock had been \nsuch that alone he had been unable to face it. \nHe needed the help of another, and the thera­\npeutic task was the slow establishment of con­\nfidence, rather than the demonstration of a \nclinical theory. \nFrom cases like this I learned to adapt my \nmethods to the needs of the individual patient, \nrather than to commit myself to general theore­\ntical considerations that might be inapplicable \nThe Madhouse,  painted by Goya Note \nthe \"king\" and the \"bishop\" on the \nright'. Schizophrenia often takes \nthe form of \"personal exaltation \" \n65\n\f\nin any particular case. The knowledge of \nhuman nature that I have accumulated in the \ncourse of 60 years of practical experience has \ntaught me to consider each case as a new one \nin which, first ol all, I have had to seek the in­\ndividual approach. Sometimes I have not hesi­\ntated to plunge into a careful study of infantile \nevents and fantasies; at other times I have be­\ngun at the lop, even if this has meant soaring \nstraight into the most remote metaphysical \nspeculations. It all depends on learning the \nlanguage of the individual patient and follow­\ning the gropings of his unconscious toward the \nlight. Some cases demand one method and some \nanother. \nlitis is especially true when one seeks to in­\nterpret symbols. Two different individuals may \nhave almost exactly the same dream. This, as \none soon discovers in clinical experience, is less \nuncommon than the layman may think.) Yet \nif. for instance, one dreamer is young and the \nother old. the problem that disturbs them is \ncorrespondingly different, and it would be \nobviously absurd to interpret both dreams in \nthe same wav. \nAn example that comes to my mind is a \ndream in which a group of young men are \nriding on horseback across a wide field. The \ndreamer is in the lead and he jumps a ditch \nfull of water, just clearing this hazard. The rest \nof the party fall into the ditch. Now the young \nman who first told me this dream was a \ncautious, introverted type. But I also heard the \nsame dream from an old man of daring char­\nacter, who had lived an active and enterprising \nlife. At the time he had this dream, he was an \ninvalid who gave his doctor and nurse a great \ndeal of trouble; he had actually injured him­\nself by his disobedience of medical instructions. \nIt was clear to me that this dream was telling \nthe young man what he ought to do. But it was \ntelling the old man what he actually was still \nlining. Whereas it encouraged the hesitant young \nman. the old man was in no such need of en­\ncouragement ; the spirit of enterprise that still \nflickered within him was. indeed, his greatest \ntrouble. This example shows how the interpre­\ntation of dreams and symbols largely depends \nupon the individual circumstances of the \ndreamer and the condition of his mind. \nAs this museum display shows, the \nfetus of man resembles those of \nother animals (and thus provides \nan indication of man's physical \nevolution) The psyche, too, has \n\"evolved \"; and some contents of \nmodern man's unconscious resemble \nproducts of the mind of ancient \nman Jung termed these products \narchetypal images \n66\n\f\nThe archetype in dream symbolism \nI have already suggested that dreams serve the \npurpose of compensation. This assumption \nmeans that the dream is a normal psychic phe­\nnomenon that transmits unconscious reactions \norspontaneousimpulses to consciousness. Many \ndreams can be interpreted with the help of the \ndreamer, who provides both the associations to \nand the context of the dream image, by means \nof which one can look at all its aspects. \nThis method is adequate in all ordinary \ncases, such as those when a relative, a friend, \nor a patient tells you a dream more or less in \nthe course of conversation. But when it is a \nmatter of obsessive dreaming or of highly emo­\ntional dreams, the personal associations pro­\nduced by the dreamer do not usually suffice for \na satisfactory interpretation. In such cases, we \nhave to take into consideration the fact (first \nobserved and commented on by Freud J that \nelements often occur in a dream that are not \nindividual and that cannot be derived from \nthe dreamer's personal experience. These ele­\nments, as I have previously mentioned, are what \nFreud called \"archaic remnants\" mental \nforms whose presence cannot be explained by \nanything in the individual's own life and which \nseem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited \nshapes of the human mind. \nJust as the human body represents a whole \nmuseum of organs, each with a long evolution­\nary history behind it, so we should expect to \nfind that the mind is organized in a similar \nway. It can no more be a product without his­\ntory than is the body in which it exists. By \n\"history\" I do not mean the fact that the mind \nbuilds itself up by conscious reference to the \npast through language and other cultural tradi­\ntions. I am referring to the biological, prehis­\ntoric, and unconscious development of the mind \nin archaic man, whose psyche was still close to \nthat of the animal. \nThis immensely old psyche forms the basis \nof our mind, just as much as the structure of \nour body is based on the general anatomical \npattern of the mammal. The trained eye of the \nanatomist or the biologist finds many traces of \nthis original pattern in our bodies. The experi­\nenced investigator of the mind can similarly see \nthe analogies between the dream pictures of \nmodern man and the products of the primitive \nmind, its \"collective images,\" and its mytholo­\ngical motifs. \nJust as the biologist needs the science of com­\nparative anatomy, however, the psychologist \ncannot do without a \"comparative anatomy of \nthe psyche.\" In practice, to put it differently, \nthe psychologist must have a sufficient experi­\nence not only of dreams and other products of \nunconscious activity, but also of mythology in \nits widest sense. Without this equipment, no­\nbody can spot the important analogies; it is not \npossible, for instance, to see the analogy be­\ntween a case of compulsion neurosis and that of \na classical demonic possession without a work­\ning knowledge of both. \nMy views about the \"archaic remnants,\" \nwhich I call \"archetypes\" or \"primordial \nimages,\" have been constantly criticized by \npeople who lack a sufficient knowledge of the \npsychology of dreams and of mythology. The \nterm \"archetype\" is often misunderstood as \nmeaning certain definite mythological images \nor motifs. But these are nothing more than \nconscious representations; it would be absurd \nto assume that such variable representations \ncould be inherited. \nThe archetype is a tendency to form such \nrepresentations ofa motif—representations that \ncan vary a great deal in detail without losing \ntheir basic pattern. There are, for instance, \nmany representations of the motif of the hostile \nbrethren, but the motif itself remains the same. \nMy critics have incorrectly assumed that I am \ndealing with \"inherited representations,\" and \non that ground they have dismissed the idea of \nthe archetype as mere superstition. They have \n67\n\f\nMan's unconscious archetypal images \nare as instinctive as the ability \nof geese to migrate (in formation); \nas ants' forming organized societies; \nas bees' tail-wagging dance (above) \nthat communicates to the hive the \nexact location of a food source \nA modern professor had a \"vision\" \nexactly like a woodcut in an old \nbook that he had never seen. Right, \nthe book's title page; and another \nwoodcut, symbolizing the male and \nfemale principles united. Such \narchetypal symbols arise from the \npsyche's age-old collective basis. \n68\n\f\nfailed to take into account the fact that if \narchetypes were representations that originated \nin our consciousness (or were acquired by con­\nsciousness), we should surely understand them, \nand not be bewildered and astonished when \nthey present themselves in our consciousness. \nThey are, indeed, an instinctive trend, as \nmarked as the impulse of birds to build nests, \nor ants to form organized colonies. \nHere I must clarify the relation between \ninstincts and archetypes: What we properly call \ninstincts are physiological urges, and are per­\nceived by the senses. But at the same time, \nthey also manifest themselves in fantasies and \noften reveal their presence only by symbolic \nimages. These manifestations are what I call \nthe archetypes. They are without known origin; \nand they reproduce themselves in any time or \nin any part of the world —even where trans­\nmission by direct descent or \"cross fertilization\" \nthrough migration must be ruled out. \nI can remember many cases of people who \nhave consulted me because they were baflled \nby their own dreams or bv their children's. \nThey were at a complete loss to understand the \nterms of the dreams. The reason was that the \ndreams contained images that they could not \nrelate to anything they could remember or \ncould have passed on to their children. Yet \nsome of these patients were highly educated: A \nfew of them were actually psychiatrists them­\nselves. \nI vividly recall the case of a professor who \nhad had a sudden vision and thought he was \ninsane. He came to see me in a state of com­\nplete panic. I simply took a 400-year-old book \nfrom the shelf and showed him an old woodcut \ndepicting his very vision. \"There's no reason for \nyou to believe that you're insane,\" I said to \nhim. \"They knew about your vision 400 years \nago.\" Whereupon he sat down entirely deflated, \nbut once more normal. \nA very important case came to me from a \nman who was himself a psychiatrist. One day \nhe brought me a handwritten booklet he had \nreceived as a Christmas present from his 10-\n\\ear-old daughter. It contained a whole series \nof dreams she had had when she was eight. \nThey made up the weirdest series of dreams \nthat I have ever seen, and I could well under­\nstand why the father was more than just puz­\nzled by them. Though childlike, they were un-\ncannv. and they contained images whose origin \nwas whollv incomprehensible to the father. \n69\n\f\nHere are the relevant motifs from the dreams: \n1. \"The evil animal.\" a snakelike monster with \nmany horns, kills and devours all other animals. \nBut God comes from the four corners, being in \nfact four separate gods, and gives rebirth to all \nthe dead animals. \n2. An ascent into heaven, where pagan dances \nare being celebrated; and a descent into hell, \nwhere angels are doing good deeds. \n3. A horde of small animals frightens the \ndreamer. The animals increase to a tremendous \nsize, and one of them devours the little girl. \n4. A small mouse is penetrated by worms, \nsnakes, fishes, and human beings. Thus the \nmouse becomes human. This portrays the four \nstages of the origin of mankind. \n5. A drop of water is seen, as it appears when \nlooked at through a microscope. The girl sees \nthat the drop is lull of tree branches. This por­\ntrays the origin of the world. \n6. A bad bov has a clod of earth and throws \nbits of it at everyone who passes. In this way \nall the passers-by become bad. \n7. A drunken woman falls into the water and \ncomes out renewed and sober. \n8. The scene is in America, where many people \nare rolling on an ant heap, attacked by the \nants. The dreamer, in a panic, falls into a river. \n9. There is a desert on the moon where the \ndreamer sinks so deeply into the ground that \nshe reaches hell. \n10. In this dream the girl has a vision of a \nluminous ball. She touches it. Vapors emanate \nfrom it. A man comes and kills her. \n1 1. The girl dreams she is dangerously ill. Sud­\ndenly birds come out of her skin and cover her \ncompletely. \n12. Swarms of gnats obscure the sun. the moon, \nand all the stars, except one. That one star falls \nupon the dreamer. \nIn the unabridged German original, each \ndream begins with the words of the old fairv \n7\"\n\f\nParallels to archetypal motifs in \nthe girl's first dream (p. 70): \nLeft, from Strasbourg Cathedral, \nChrist crucified on Adam's grave -\nsymbolizing the theme of rebirth \n(Christ as the second Adam). In \na Navaho sand painting, above, the \nhorned heads are the four corners \nof the world. In Britain's royal \ncoronation ceremony, the monarch \n(right. Queen Elizabeth II in 1953) \nis presented to the people at the \nfour doors of Westminster Abbey. \ntale: \"Once upon a time. . . .\" By these words \nthe little dreamer suggests that she feels as if \neach dream were a sort of fairy tale, which she \nwants to tell her father as a Christmas present, \nflic lather tried to explain the dreams in \nterms of their context. But he could not do so, \nlor there seemed to he no personal associations \nto them. \nThe possibility that these dreams were con­\nscious elaborations can of course be ruled out \nonly by someone who knew the child well \nenough to be absolutely sure of her truthfulness. \n(They would, however, remain a challenge to \nour understanding even if they were fantasies. | \nIn this case, the lather was convinced that the \ndreams were authentic, and I have no reason to \ndoubt it. I knew the little girl myself, but this \nwas before she gave her dreams to her lather, \nso that I had no chance to ask her about them. \nShe lived abroad and died of an infectious \ndisease about a year after that Christmas. \n7\"\n\f\nHer dreams have a decidedly peculiar char­\nacter. Their leading thoughts are markedly \nphilosophic in concept. The first one, for \ninstance, speaks of an evil monster killing other \nanimals, but God gives rebirth to them all \nthrough a divine Apokatastasis, or restitution. \nIn the Western world this idea is known \nthrough the Christian tradition. It can be found \nin the Acts of the Apostles rn:21: \"[Christ] \nwhom the heaven must receive until the time of \nrestitution of all things. . . .\" The early Greek \nFathers of the Church (for instance, Origen) \nparticularly insisted upon the idea that, at the \nend of time, everything will be restored by the \nRedeemer to its original and perfect state. But, \naccording to St. Matthew xvn:ll, there was \nalready an old Jewish tradition that Elias \"truly \nshall first come, and restore all things.\" I Corin­\nthians xv:22 refers to the same idea in the \nfollowing words: \"For as in Adam all die, even \nso in Christ shall all be made alive.\" \nOne might guess that the child had encoun­\ntered this thought in her religious education. \nBut she had very little religious background. \nHer parents were Protestants in name; but in \nfact they knew the Bible only from hearsay. It \nis particularly unlikely that the recondite image \nof Apokataslasis had been fully explained to the \ngirl. Certainly her father had never heard of \nthis mythical idea. \nNine of the 12 dreams are influenced by the \ntheme of destruction and restoration. And none \nof these dreams shows traces of specific Chris­\ntian education or influence. On the contrary, \nthey are more closely related to primitive \nmyths. This relation is corroborated by the \nother motif—the \"cosmogonic myth\" (the cre­\nation of the world and of man) that appears in \nthe fourth and fifth dreams. The same connec­\ntion is found in I Corinthians xv:22, which I \nhave just quoted. In this passage too, Adam \nand Christ (death and resurrection) are linked \ntogether. \nThe general idea of Christ the Redeemer \nbelongs to the world-wide and pre-Christ theme \nof the hero and rescuer who, although he has \nAbove, the hero-god Raven (of the \nHaida Indians of America's Pacific \nCoast) in the belly of a whale— \ncorresponding to the \"devouring \nmonster\" motif in the girl's first \ndream (p. 70). \nThe girl's second dream—of angels \nin hell and demons in heaven— \nseems to embody the idea of the \nrelativity of morality. The same \nconcept is expressed in the dual \naspect of the fallen angel who is \nboth Satan, the devil, and (right) \nLucifer, the resplendent bringer \nof light. These opposites can also \nbe seen in the figure of God, far \nright (in a drawing by Blake): He \nappears to Job, in a dream, with \na cloven hoof like a demon's. \n72\n\f\nbeen devoured by a monster, appears again in \na miraculous way, having overcome whatever \nmonster it was that swallowed him. When and \nwhere such a motif originated nobody knows. \nWe do not even know how to go about investi­\ngating the problem. The one apparent certainty \nis that every generation seems to have known it \nas a tradition handed down from some preced­\ning time. Thus we can safely assume that it \n\"originated\" at a period when man did not yet \nknow that he possessed a hero myth; in an age, \nthat is to say, when he did not yet consciously \nreflect on what he was saying. The hero figure \nis an archetype, which has existed since time \nimmemorial. \nThe production of archetypes by children is \nespecially significant, because one can some­\ntimes be quite certain that a child has had no \ndirect access to the tradition concerned. In this \ncase, the girl's family had no more than a \nsuperficial acquaintance with the Christian tra­\ndition. Christian themes may, of course, be \nrepresented by such ideas as God, angels, hea­\nven, hell, and evil. But the way in which they \nare treated by this child points to a totally \nnon-Christian origin. \nLet us take the first dream of the God who \nreally consists of four gods, coming from the \n\"four corners.\" The corners of what? There is \nno room mentioned in the dream. A room \nwould not even fit in with the picture of what \nis obviously a cosmic event, in which the Uni­\nversal Being himself intervenes. The quaternity \n(or element of \"fourness\") itself is a strange \nidea, but one that plays a great role in many \nreligions and philosophies. In the Christian re­\nligion, it has been superseded by the Trinity, a \nnotion that we must assume was known to the \nchild. But who in an ordinary middle-class \nfamily of today would be likely to know of a \ndivine quaternity? It is an idea that was once \nfairly familiar among students of the Hermetic \nphilosophy in the Middle Ages, but it petered \nout with the beginning of the 18th century, and \nit has been entirely obsolete for at least 200 \nyears. Where, then, did the little girl pick it up? \nV/jtk Dreams upon my bed thoa nearest ine ^alfngkestme \nwith. Visions 73\n\f\nFrom EzekieFs vision? But there is no Christian \nteaching that identifies the seraphim with God. \nThe same question may he asked about the \nhorned serpent. In the Bible, it is true, there \nare many horned animals in the Book of \nRevelation, for instance. But all these seem to \nbe quadruped, although their overlord is the \ndragon, the Greek word for which (drakon) also \nmeans serpent. The horned serpent appears in \n16th-century Latin alchemy as the quadricor-\nnulus serpens four-horned serpent), a symbol \nof Mercury and an antagonist of the Christian \nTrinity. But this is an obscure reference. So far \nas I can discover, it is made by only one \nauthor; and this child had no means of know­\ning it. \nIn the second dream, a motif appears that is \ndefinitely non-Christian and that contains a re­\nversal of accepted values for instance, pagan \ndances by men in heaven and good deeds by \nangels in hell. This symbol suggests a relativity \nof moral values. Where did the child find such \na revolutionary notion, worthy of Nietzsche's \ngenius? \nThese questions lead us to another: What is \nthe compensatory meaning of these dreams, to \nwhich the little girl obviously attributed so \nmuch importance that she presented them to \nher father as a Christmas present? \nIf the dreamer had been a primitive medi­\ncine man, one could reasonably assume that \nthey represent variations of the philosophical \nthemes ol death, of resurrection or restitution, \nof the origin of the world, the creation of man. \nand the relativity of values. But one might give \nup such dreams as hopelessly difficult if one \ntried to interpret them from a personal level. \nThey undoubtedly contain '\"collective images.\" \nand they are in a way analogous to the doc­\ntrines taught to young people in primitive tribes \nwhen they are about to be initiated as men. At \nsuch times they learn about what God, or the \ngods, or the \"founding\" animals have done, \nhow the world and man were created, how the \nend of the world will come, and the meaning ol \ndeath. Is there any occasion when we, in Chris­\ntian civilization, hand out similar instructions? \nThere is: in adolescence. But many people \nbegin to think again of things like this in old \nage. at the approach of death. \nThe little girl, as it happened, was in both \nthese situations. She was approaching puberty \nand, at the same time, the end of her life. Little \nor nothing in the symbolism of her dreams \nThe little girl's dreams (p. 70) \ncontain symbols of creation, death, \nand rebirth, which resemble the \nteachings given to adolescents in \nprimitive initiation rituals. Left, \nthe end of a Navaho ceremony: \nA girl, having become a woman, \ngoes into the desert to meditate. \nDeath and rebirth symbolism also \nappears in dreams at the end of \nlife, when the approach of death \ncasts a shadow before it. Right, \none of Goya's last paintings: The \nstrange creature, apparently a \ndog, that emerges from the dark \ncan be interpreted as the artist's \nforeshadowing of his death In \nmany mythologies dogs appear as \nguides to the land of the dead \n74\n\f\npoints to the beginning of a normal adult life, \nbut there are many allusions to destruction and \nrestoration. When I first read her dreams, in­\ndeed, I had the uncanny feeling that they sug­\ngested impending disaster. The reason I felt \nlike that was the peculiar nature of the com­\npensation that I deduced from the symbolism. \nIt was the opposite of what one would expect \nto find in the consciousness of a girl of that age. \nThese dreams open up a new and rather \nterrifying aspect of life and death. One would \nexpect to find such images in an aging person \nwho looks back upon life, rather than to be \ngiven them by a child who would normally be \nlooking forward. Their atmosphere recalls the \nold Roman saying, \"Life is a short dream,\" \nrather than the joy and exuberance of its \nspringtime. For this child's life was like a \nver sacrum vovendum (vow of a vernal sacri­\nfice), as the Roman poet puts it. Experience \nshows that the unknown approach of death \ncasts an adumbratio (an anticipatory shadow; \nover the life and dreams of the victim. Even \nthe altar in Christian churches represents, on \nthe one hand, a tomb and, on the other, a place \nof resurrection the transformation of death \ninto eternal life. \nSuch are the ideas that the dreams brought \nhome to the child. They were a preparation for \ndeath, expressed through short stories, like the \ntales told at primitive initiations or the Koans \nof Zen Buddhism. This message is unlike the \northodox Christian doctrine and more like \nancient primitive thought. It seems to have \noriginated outside historical tradition in the \nlong-forgotten psychic sources that, since pre­\nhistoric times, have nourished philosophical and \nreligious speculation about life and death. \nIt was as if future events were casting their \nshadow back by arousing in the child certain \nthought forms that, though normally dormant, \ndescribe or accompany the approach of a fatal \nissue. Although the specific shape in which they \nexpress themselves is more or less personal, their \ngeneral pattern is collective. They are found \neverywhere and at all times, just as animal \ninstincts vary a good deal in the different \nspecies and yet serve the same general pur­\nposes. We do not assume that each new-born \nanimal creates its own instincts as an individual \nacquisition, and we must not suppose that \nhuman individuals invent their specific human \nways with every new birth. Like the instincts, \nthe collective thought patterns of the human \nmind are innate and inherited. They function, \nwhen the occasion arises, in more or less the \nsame way in all of us. \nEmotional manifestations, to which such \nthought patterns belong, are recognizably the \nsame all over the earth. We can identify them \neven in animals, and the animals themselves \nunderstand one another in this respect, even \nthough they may belong to different species. \nAnd what about insects, with their complicated \nsymbiotic functions? Most of them do not even \nknow their parents and have nobody to teach \nthem. Why should one assume, then, that man \nis the only living being deprived of specific \ninstincts, or that his psyche is devoid of all \ntraces of its evolution? \n.Naturally, if you identify the psyche with \nconsciousness, you can easily fall into the erro­\nneous idea that man comes into the world with \na psyche that is empty, and that in later years \nit contains nothing more than what it has \n7.-,\n\f\nlearned by individual experience. But the \npsyche is more than consciousness. Animals \nhave little consciousness, but many impulses \nand reactions that denote the existence of a \npsyche; and primitives do a lot of things whose \nmeaning is unknown to them. \nYou may ask many civilized people in vain \nfor the real meaning of the Christmas tree or \nof the Easter egg. The fact is, they do things \nwithout knowing why they do them. I am \ninclined to the view that things were generally \ndone first and that it was only a long time \nafterward that somebody asked why they were \ndone. The medical psychologist is constantly \nconfronted with otherwise intelligent patients \nwho behave in a peculiar and unpredictable \nway and who have no inkling of what they say \nor do. They are suddenly caught by unreason­\nable moods for which they themselves cannot \naccount. \nSuperficially, such reactions and impulses \nseem to be of an intimately personal nature, \nand so we dismiss them as idiosyncratic be­\nhavior. In fact, they are based upon a pre­\nformed and ever-ready instinctive system that is \ncharacteristic of man. Thought forms, univer­\nsally understandable gestures, and many atti­\ntudes follow a pattern that was established long \nbefore man developed a reflective consciousness. \nIt is even conceivable that the early origins \nof man's capacity to reflect come from the pain­\nful consequences of violent emotional clashes. \nLet me take, purely as an illustration of this \npoint, the bushman who, in a moment of anger \nand disappointment at his failure to catch any \nfish, strangles his much beloved only son, and \nis then seized with immense regret as he holds \nthe little dead body in his arms. Such a man \nmight remember this moment of pain for ever. \nWe cannot know whether this kind of experi­\nence was actually the initial cause of the de­\nvelopment of human consciousness. But there \nis no doubt that the shock of a similar emo­\ntional experience is often needed to make \npeople wake up and pay attention to what they \nare doing. There is a famous case of a 13th-\ncentury Spanish hidalgo, Raimon Lull, who fin­\nally (after a long chase) succeeded in meeting \nthe lady he admired at a secret rendezvous. She \nsilently opened her dress and showed him her \nbreast, rotten with cancer. The shock changed \nLull's life; he eventually became an eminent \ntheologian and one of the Church's greatest \nmissionaries. In the case of such a sudden \nchange one can often prove that an archetype \nhas been at work for a long time in the uncon­\nscious, skillfully arranging circumstances that \nwill lead to the crisis. \nSuch experiences seem to show that arche­\ntypal forms are not just static patterns. They \nare dynamic factors that manifest themselves \nin impulses, just as spontaneously as the in­\nstincts. Certain dreams, visions, or thoughts can \nsuddenly appear; and however carefully one \ninvestigates, one cannot find out what causes \nthem. This does not mean that they have no \ncause; they certainly have. But it is so remote \nor obscure that one cannot see what it is. In \nSome dreams seem to predict the \nfuture (perhaps due to unconscious \nknowledge of future possibilities); \nthus dreams were long used as \ndivination. In Greece the sick \nwould ask the healing god Asklepios \nfor a dream indicating a cure. Left, \na relief depicts such a dream cure: \nA snake (the god's symbol) bites a \nman's diseased shoulder and the \ngod (far left) heals the shoulder. \nRight, Constantine (an Italian \npainting c 1460) dreaming before a \nbattle that was to make him Roman \nEmperor. He dreamed of the cross, \na symbol of Christ, and a voice \nsaid: \"In this sign conquer.\" He \ntook the sign as his emblem, won \nthe battle, and was thus \nconverted to Christianity\n\f\n\n\f\nsuch a case, one must wait either until the \ndream and its meaning are sufficiently under­\nstood, or until some external event occurs that \nwill explain the dream. \nAt the moment of the dream, this event may \nstill lie in the future. But just as our conscious \nthoughts often occupy themselves with the \nfuture and its possibilities, so do the unconscious \nand its dreams. There has long been a general \nbelief that the chief function of dreams is pro­\ngnostication of the future. In antiquity, and as \nlate as the Middle Ages, dreams played their \npart in medical prognosis. I can confirm by a \nmodern dream the element of prognosis (or pre­\ncognition that can be found in an old dream \nrpioted by Artemidorus of Daldis, in the second \ncentury A.O. A man dreamed that he saw his \nlather die in the flames of a house on (ire. Not \nlong afterwards, he himself died in a phlegmon? \n(fire, or high lexer:, which I presume was \npneumonia. \nIt so happened that a colleague of mine was \nonce suffering from a deadly gangrenous fever \nin fact, a phlegmone. A former patient of \nhis, who had no knowledge of the nature of his \ndoctor's illness, dreamed that the doctor died \nin a great fire. At that time the doctor had \njust entered a hospital and the disease was only \nbeginning. The dreamer knew nothing but the \nbare fact that his doctor was ill and in a \nhospital. Three weeks later, the doctor died. \nAs this example shows, dreams may have an \nanticipatory or prognostic aspect, and anybody \ntrying to interpret them must take this into \nconsideration, especially where an obviously \nmeaningful dream does not provide a context \nsufficient to explain it. Such a dream often \ncomes right out of the blue, and one wonders \nwhat could have prompted it. Of course, if one \nknew its ulterior message, its cause would be \nclear. For it is only our consciousness that does \nnot yet know; the unconscious seems already \ninformed, and to have come to a conclusion \nthat is expressed in the dream. In fact, the un­\nconscious seems to be able to examine and to \ndraw conclusions from facts, much as conscious­\nness does. It can even use certain facts, and \nanticipate their possible results, just because we \nare not conscious of them. \nBut as far as one can make out from dreams, \nthe unconscious makes its deliberations instinc­\ntively. The distinction is important. Logical \nanalysis is the prerogative of consciousness; we \nselect with reason and knowledge. The uncon­\nscious, however, seems to be guided chiefly by \ninstinctive trends, represented by corresponding \nthought forms that is. by the archetypes. A \ndoctor who is asked to describe the course of \nan illness will use such rational concepts as \n\"infection\" or \"fever.\" The dream is more \npoetic. It presents the diseased body as a man's \nearthly house, and the fever as the fire that is \ndestroying it. \nAs the above dream shows, the archetypal \nmind has handled the situation in the same way \nas it did in the time of Artemidorus. Something \nthat is of a more or less unknown nature has \nbeen intuitively grasped In the unconscious and \nsubmitted to an archetypal treatment. This sug­\ngests that, instead of the process of reasoning \nthat conscious thought would have applied, the \narchetypal mind has stepped in and taken over \nIn a dream quoted from Artemidorus \non this page, a burning house \nsymbolizes a fever The human body \nis often represented as a house: \nLeft, from an 18th-century Hebrew \nencyclopedia, the body and a house \nare compared in detail—turrets as \nears, windows as eyes, a furnace \nas stomach, etc. Right, in a cartoon \nby James Thurber, a henpecked \nhusband sees his home and his wife \nas the same being\n\f\nthe task of prognostication. The archetypes thus \nhave their own initiative and their own specific \nenergy. These powers enable them both to pro­\nduce a meaningful interpretation (in their own \nsymbolic style) and to interfere in a given situa­\ntion with their own impulses and their own \nthought formations. In this respect, they func­\ntion like complexes; they come and go very \nmuch as they please, and often they obstruct or \nmodify our conscious intentions in an embar­\nrassing way. \nWe can perceive the specific energv of \narchetypes when we experience the peculiar \nfascination that accompanies them. They seem \nto hold a special spell. Such a peculiar quality \nis also characteristic ol the personal complexes; \nand just as personal complexes have their indi­\nvidual history, so do social complexes of an \narchetypal character. But while personal com­\nplexes never produce more than a personal bias, \narchetypes create myths, religions, and philoso­\nphies that influence and characterize whole \nnations and epochs of history. We regard the \npersonal complexes as compensations for one­\nsided or faulty attitudes of consciousness; in \nthe saine way. myths of a religious nature can \nbe interpreted as a sort of mental therapy for \nthe sufferings and anxieties of mankind in \ngeneral hunger, war, disease, old age, death. \nThe universal hero myth, lot example, \nalways refers to a powerful man or god-man \nwho vanquishes evil in the form of dragons, \nserpents, monsters, demons, and so on, and who \nliberates his people from destruction and death, \nfhe narration or ritual repetition of sacred texts \nand ceremonies, and the worship of such a \nfigure with dances, music, hymns, prayers, and \nsacrifices, grip the audience with numinous \nemotions (as if with magic spells) and exalt the \nindividual to an identification with the hero. \nII we try to see such a situation with the \neyes of a believer, we can perhaps understand \nhow the ordinary man can be liberated from \nhis personal impotence and misery and en­\ndowed (at least temporarily) with an almost \nsuperhuman quality. Often enough such a con­\nviction will sustain him for a long time and \ngive a certain style to his life. It may even set \nthe tone of a whole society. A remarkable \ninstance of this can be found in the Eleusinian \nmysteries, which were finally suppressed at the \nbeginning of the seventh century of the Chris­\ntian era. They expressed, together with the \nDelphic oracle, the essence and spirit of ancient \nGreece. On a much greater scale, the Christian \nera itself owes its name and significance to the \nantique mystery of the god-man. which has its \nroots in the archetypal Osiris-Horus myth of \nancient Egypt. \nIt is commonly assumed that on some given \noccasion in prehistoric times, the basic mytho­\nlogical ideas were \"invented\" by a clever old \nphilosopher or prophet, and ever afterward \n\"believed\" by a credulous and uncritical \npeople. It is said that stories told by a power-\nseeking priesthood are not \"true.\" but merely \n\"'wishful thinking.\" But the very word \"invent\" \nis derived from the Latin invenirt, and means \nto \"iind\" and hence to find something by •\"seek­\ning\" it. In the latter case the word itself hints \nat some foreknowledge of what you are going \nto find. \nThe energy of archetypes can be \nfocused (through rituals and other \nappeals to mass emotion) to move \npeople to collective action The \nNazis knew this, and used versions \nof Teutonic myths to help rally \nthe country to their cause Far right, \na propaganda painting of Hitler as \na heroic crusader; right, a solstice \nfestival celebrated in summer by \nthe Hitler Youth, a revival of an \nancient pagan festival\n\f\n8o \nTop, a child's painting of Christmas \nincludes the familiar tree decorated \nwith candles. The evergreen tree is \nconnected with Christ through the \nsymbolism of the winter solstice \nand the \"new year\" (the new aeon of \nChristianity) There are many links \nbetween Christ and the tree symbol: \nThe cross is often seen as a tree, \nas in a medieval Italian fresco, \nleft, of Christ crucified on the tree \nof knowledge. Candles in Christian \nceremonies symbolize divine light, as \nin the Swedish festival of St Lucia \n(above), where girls wear crowns of \nburning candles."

    "raw_text": "Let me go back to the strange ideas con­\ntained in the dreams of the little girl. It seems \nunlikely that she sought them out, since she was \nsurprised to find them. They occurred to her \nrather as peculiar and unexpected stories, which \nseemed noteworthy enough to be given to her \nfather as a Christmas present. In doing so, how­\never, she lifted them up into the sphere of our \nstill living Christian mystery—the birth of our \nLord, mixed with the secret of the evergreen \ntree that carries the new-born Light. (This is \nthe reference of the fifth dream.) \nAlthough there is ample historical evidence \nfor the symbolic relation between Christ and \nthe tree symbol, the little girl's parents would \nhave been gravely embarrassed had they been \nasked to explain exactly what they meant by \ndecorating a tree with burning candles to cele­\nbrate the nativity of Christ. \"Oh, it's just a \nChristmas custom!\" they would have said. A \nserious answer would require a far-reaching \ndissertation about the antique symbolism of the \ndying god, and its relation to the cult of the \nGreat Mother and her symbol, the tree—to \nmention only one aspect of this complicated \nproblem. f \nThe further we delve into the origins of a \n\"collective image\" (or, to express it in ecclesi­\nastical language, of a dogma), the more we un­\ncover a seemingly unending web of archetypal \npatterns that, before modern times, were never \nthe object of conscious reflection. Thus, para­\ndoxically enough, we know more about mytho­\nlogical symbolism than did any generation \nbefore our own. The fact is that in former times \nmen did not reflect upon their symbols; they \nlived them and were unconsciously animated by \ntheir meaning. \nI will illustrate this by an experience I once \nhad with the primitives of Mount Elgon in \nAfrica. Every morning at dawn, they leave their \nhuts and breathe or spit into their hands, which \nthey then stretch out to the first rays of the sun, \nas if they were offering either their breath or \ntheir spittle to the rising god — to mungu. (This \nSwahili word, which they used in explaining \nthe ritual act, is derived from a Polynesian root \nequivalent to mana or mulungu. These and \nsimilar terms designate a \"power\" of extra­\nordinary efficiency and pervasiveness, which we \nshould call divine. Thus the word mungu is \ntheir equivalent for Allah or God.) When I \nasked them what they meant by this act, or \nwhy they did it, they were completely baffled. \nThey could only say: \"We have always done \nit. It has always been done when the sun rises.\" \nThey laughed at the obvious conclusion that \nthe sun is mungu. The sun indeed is not mungu \nwhen it is above the horizon; mungu is the actual \nmoment of the sunrise. \nWhat they were doing was obvious to me, \nbut not to them; they just did it, never reflect­\ning on what they did. They were consequently \nunable to explain themselves. I concluded that \nthey were offering their souls to mungu, be­\ncause the breath (of life) and the spittle mean \n\"soul-substance.\" To breathe or spit upon \nsomething conveys a \"magical\" effect, as, for \ninstance, when Christ used spittle to cure the \nblind, or where a son inhales his dying father's \nlast breath in order to take over the father's \nsoul. It is most unlikely that these Africans ever, \neven in the remote past, knew any more about \nthe meaning of their ceremony. In fact, their \nancestors probably knew even less, because they \nwere even more profoundly unconscious of their \nmotives and thought less about their doings. \nGoethe's Faust aptly says: \"Im Anfang war \ndie Tat [In the beginning was the deed].\" \n\"Deeds\" were never invented, they were done; \nthoughts, on the other hand, are a relatively \nlate discovery of man. First he was moved to \ndeeds by unconscious factors; it was only a long \ntime afterward that he began to reflect upon \nthe causes that had moved him; and it took \nhim a very long time indeed to arrive at the \npreposterous idea that he must have moved \nhimself—his mind being unable to identify any \nother motivating force than his own. \nWe should laugh at the idea of a plant or an \nanimal inventing itself, yet there are many \npeople who believe that the psyche or mind \ninvented itself and thus was the creator of its \nown existence. As a matter of fact, the mind \nhas grown to its present state of consciousness \nas an acorn grows into an oak or as saurians \n81\n\f\ndeveloped into mammals. As it has for so long \nbeen developing, so it still develops, and thus \nwe are moved by forces from within as well as \nby stimuli from without. \nThese inner motives spring from a deep \nsource that is not made by consciousness and is \nnot under its control. In the mythology of \nearlier times, these forces were called mana, or \nspirits, demons, and gods. They are as active \ntoday as they ever were. If they conform to our \nwishes, we call them happy hunches or impulses \nand pat ourselves on the back for being smart \nfellows. If they go against us, then we say that \nit is just bad luck, or that certain people are \nagainst us, or that the cause of our misfortunes \nmust be pathological. The one thing we refuse \nto admit is that we are dependent upon \n\"powers\" that are beyond our control. \nIt is true, however, that in recent times civil­\nized man has acquired a certain amount of will \npower, which he can apply where he pleases. \nHe has learned to do his work efficiently with­\nout having recourse to chanting and drumming \nto hypnotize him into the state of doing. He-\ncan even dispense with a daily prayer for divine \naid. He can carry out what he proposes to do, \nand he can apparently translate his ideas into \naction without a hitch, whereas the primitive \nseems to be hampered at each step by fears, \nsuperstitions, and other unseen obstacles to \naction. The motto \"Where there's a will, there's \na way\" is the superstition of modern man. \nYet in order to sustain his creed, contem­\nporary man pays the price in a remarkable lack \nof introspection. He is blind to the fact that, \nwith all his rationality and efficiency, he is \npossessed by \"powers\" that are beyond his con­\ntrol. His gods and demons have not disappeared \nat all; they have merely got new names. They \nkeep him on the run with restlessness, vague \napprehensions, psychological complications, an \ninsatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food \nand, above all, a large array of neuroses. \nTwo examples of belief in the \n\"magical\" guality of breath: Below \nleft, a Zulu witch doctor cures a \npatient by blowing into his ear \nthrough a cow's horn (to drive the \nspirits out); below, a medieval \npainting of the creation depicts \nGod breathing life into Adam. Right, \nin a 13th-century Italian painting, \nChrist heals a blind man with \nspittle—which, like breath, has \nlong been believed to have a life-\ngiving ability\n\f\nThe soul of man \nWhat we call civilized consciousness has steadily \nseparated itself from the basic instincts. But \nthese instincts have not disappeared. They have \nmerely lost their contact with our consciousness \nand are thus forced to assert themselves in an \nindirect fashion. This may be by means of \nphysical symptoms in the case of a neurosis, or \nby means of incidents of various kinds, such as \nunaccountable moods, unexpected forgetful-\nness, or mistakes in speech. \nA man likes to believe that he is the master \nof his soul. But as long as he is unable to control \nhis moods and emotions, or to be conscious of \nthe myriad secret ways in which unconscious \nfactors insinuate themselves into his arrange­\nments and decisions, he is certainly not his own \nmaster. These unconscious factors owe their \nexistence to the autonomy of the archetypes. \nModern man protects himself against seeing his \nown split state by a system of compartments. \nCertain areas of outer life and of his own \nbehavior are kept, as it were, in separate \ndrawers and arc never confronted with one \nanother. \nAs an example of this so-called compartment \npsychology, I remember the case of an alcoholic \nwho had come under the laudable influence of \na certain religious movement, and, fascinated \nby its enthusiasm, had forgotten that he needed \na drink. He was obviously and miraculously \ncured by Jesus, and he was correspondingly \ndisplayed as a witness to divine grace or to the \nefficiency of the said religious organization. But \nafter a few weeks of public confessions, the \nnovelty began to pale and some alcoholic re­\nfreshment seemed to be indicated, and so he \ndrank again. But this time the helpful organ­\nization came to the conclusion that the case was \n\"pathological\" and obviously not suitable for \nan intervention by Jesus, so they put him into \na clinic to let the doctor do better than the \ndiv ine healer. \nThis is an aspect of the modern \"cultural\" \nmind that is worth looking into. It shows an \n«3\n\f\n84\n\f\nalarming degree of dissociation and psycho­\nlogical confusion. \nIf, for a moment, we regard mankind as one \nindividual, we see that the human race is like \na person carried away by unconscious powers; \nand the human race also likes to keep certain \nproblems tucked away in separate drawers. But \nthis is why we should give a great deal of con­\nsideration to what we are doing, for mankind \nis now threatened by self-created and deadly \ndangers that are growing beyond our control. \nOur world is, so to speak, dissociated like a \nneurotic, with the Iron Curtain marking the \nsymbolic line of division. Western man, becom­\ning aware of the aggressive will to power of \nthe East, sees himself forced to take extraordin­\nary measures of defense, at the same time as \nhe prides himself on his virtue and good \nintentions. \nWhat he fails to see is that it is his own vices, \nwhich he has covered up by good international \nmanners, that are thrown back in his face by \nthe communist world, shamelessly and meth­\nodically. What the West has tolerated, but \nsecretly and with a slight sense of shame (the \ndiplomatic lie, systematic deception, veiled \nthreats), comes back into the open and in full \nmeasure from the East and ties us up in neu­\nrotic knots. It is the face of his own evil shadow \nthat grins at Western man from the other side \nof the Iron Curtain. \nIt is this state of affairs that explains the \npeculiar feeling of helplessness of so many \npeople in Western societies. They have begun \nto realize that the difficulties confronting us are \nmoral problems, and that the attempts to \nanswer them by a policy of piling up nuclear \narms or by economic \"competition\" is achiev­\ning little, for it cuts both ways. Many of us \nnow understand that moral and mental means \nwould be more efficient, since they could pro­\nvide us with psychic immunity against the ever-\nincreasing infection. \n\"Our world is dissociated like a \nneurotic.\" Left, the Berlin Wall. \nBut all such attempts have proved singularly \nineffective, and will do so as long as we try to \nconvince ourselves and the world that it is only \nthey (i.e. our opponents) who are wrong, ft \nwould be much more to the point for us to \nmake a serious attempt to recognize our own \nshadow and its nefarious doings. If we could \nsee our shadow (the dark side of our nature), \nwe should be immune to any moral and mental \ninfection and insinuation. As matters now \nstand, we lay ourselves open to every infection, \nbecause we are really doing practically the \nsame thing as they. Only we have the addi­\ntional disadvantage that we neither see nor \nwant to understand what we ourselves are \ndoing, under the cover of good manners. \nThe communist world, it may be noted, has \none big myth (which we call an illusion, in \nthe vain hope that our superior judgment will \nmake it disappear). It is the time-hallowed \narchetypal dream of a Golden Age (or Para­\ndise), where everything is provided in abund­\nance for everyone, and a great, just, and wise \nchief rules over a human kindergarten. This \npowerful archetype in its infantile form has \ngripped them, but it will never disappear from \nthe world at the mere sight of our superior \npoint of view. We even support it by our own \nchildishness, for our Western civilization is in \nthe grip of the same mythology. Unconsciously, \nwe cherish the same prejudices, hopes, and \nexpectations. We too believe in the welfare \nstate, in universal peace, in the equality of man, \nin his eternal human rights, in justice, truth, \nand (do not say it too loudly) in the Kingdom \nof God on Earth. \nThe sad truth is that man's real life consists \nof a complex of inexorable opposites—day and \nnight, birth and death, happiness and misery, \ngood and evil. We are not even sure that one \nwill prevail against the other, that good will \novercome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a \nbattleground. It always has been, and always \nwill be; and if it were not so, existence would \ncome to an end. \nIt was precisely this conflict within man that \nled the early Christians to expect and hope for \nan early end to this world, or the Buddhists to \n85"

    "raw_text": "Every society has its idea of the \narchetypal paradise or golden age \nthat, it is believed, once existed \nand will exist again. Left, a 19th-\ncentury American painting embodies \nthe idea of a past Utopia: It shows \nWilliam Penn's treaty with the \nIndians in 1682 occurring in an ideal \nsetting where all is harmony and \npeace. Below left, a reflection of \nthe idea of a Utopia yet to come: \nA poster in a Moscow park shows \nLenin leading the Russian people \ntoward the future \nAbove, the Garden of Eden, depicted \nas a walled (and womb-like) garden \nin a 1 5th-century'French painting \nand showing the expulsion of Adam \nand Eve.

These \nbasic answers would be frankly suicidal if they \nwere not linked up with peculiar mental and \nmoral ideas and practices that constitute the \nbulk of both religions and that, to a certain \nextent, modify their radical denial of the world. \nI stress this point because, in our time, there \nare millions of people who have lost faith in \nany kind of religion. Such people do not under­\nstand their religion any longer. While life runs \nsmoothly without religion, the loss remains as \ngood as unnoticed. But when suffering comes, \nit is another matter. That is when people begin \nto seek a way out and to reflect about the \nmeaning of life and its bewildering and painful \nexperiences. \nIt is significant that the psychological doctor \n(within my experience) is consulted more by \nJews and Protestants than by Catholics. This \nmight be expected, for the Catholic Church \nstill feels responsible for the cura animarum \n(the care and welfare of souls). But in this \nscientific age, the psychiatrist is apt to be asked \nthe questions that once belonged in the domain \nof the theologian. People feel that it makes, or \nwould make, a great difference if only they had \na positive belief in a meaningful way of life or \nin God and immortality. The specter of ap­\nproaching death often gives a powerful incen­\ntive to such thoughts. From time immemorial, \nmen have had ideas about a Supreme Being \n(one or several) and about the Land of the \nHereafter. Only today do they think they can \ndo without such ideas. \nBecause we cannot discover God's throne in \nthe sky with a radio telescope or establish (for \ncertain) that a beloved father or mother is still \nabout in a more or less corporeal form, people \nassume that such ideas are \"not true.\" I \nwould rather say that they are not \"true\" \nenough, for these are conceptions of a kind \nthat have accompanied human life from pre­\nhistoric times, and that still break through \ninto consciousness at any provocation. \nModern man may assert that he can \ndispense with them, and he may bolster his \nopinion by insisting that there is no scientific \nevidence of their truth. Or he may even \nregret the loss of his convictions. But since we \nare dealing with invisible and unknowable \nthings (for God is beyond human understand­\ning, and there is no means of proving immor­\ntality), why should we bother about evidence? \nEven if we did not know by reason our need \nfor salt in our food, we should nonetheless \nprofit from its use. We might argue that the \nuse of salt is a mere illusion of taste or a \nsuperstition; but it would still contribute to \nour well-being. Why, then, should we deprive \nourselves of views that would prove helpful in \ncrises and would give a meaning to our \nexistence? \nAnd how do we know that such ideas are \nnot true? Many people would agree with me \n87"

    "raw_text": "if I stated flatly that such ideas are probably \nillusions. What they fail to realize is that the \ndenial is as impossible to \"prove\" as the \nassertion of religious belief. We are entirely \nfree to choose which point of view we take; \nit will in any case be an arbitrary decision. \nThere is, however, a strong empirical reason \nwhy we should cultivate thoughts that can \nnever be proved. It is that they are known to \nbe useful. Man positively needs general ideas \nand convictions that will give a meaning to \nhis life and enable him to find a place for \nhimself in the universe. He can stand the most \nincredible hardships when he is convinced that \nthey make sense; he is crushed when, on top \nof all his misfortunes, he has to admit that he \nis taking part in a \"tale told by an idiot.\" \nIt is the role of religious symbols to give a \nmeaning to the life of man. The Pueblo \nIndians believe that they are the sons of \nFather Sun, and this belief endows their life \nwith a perspective (and a goal) that goes far \nbeyond their limited existence. It gives them \nample space for the unfolding of personality \nand permits them a full life as complete \npersons. Their plight is infinitely more satis­\nfactory than that of a man in our own civiliza­\ntion who knows that he is (and will remain) \nnothing more than an underdog with no inner \nmeaning to his life. \nA sense of a wider meaning to one's exist­\nence is what raises a man beyond mere getting \nand spending. If he lacks this sense, he is \nlost and miserable. Had St. Paul been con­\nvinced that he was nothing more than a \nLeft, the burial coffin of a South \nAmerican Cayapas Indian. The dead \nman is provided with food and \nclothing for his life after death. \nReligious symbols and beliefs of every \nkind give meaning to men's lives \nancient peoples grieved over death \n(right, an Egyptian figurine \nrepresenting mourning, which was \nfound in a tomb); yet their beliefs \nmade them also think of death as a \npositive transformation. \nwandering tent-maker he certainly would \nnot have been the man he was. His real \nand meaningful life lay in the inner certainty \nthat he was the messenger of the Lord. One \nmay accuse him of suffering from megalo­\nmania, but this opinion pales before the testi­\nmony of history and the judgment of sub­\nsequent generations. The myth that took \npossession of him made him something greater \nthan a mere craftsman. \nSuch a myth, however, consists of symbols \nthat have not been invented consciously. They \nhave happened. It was not the man Jesus \nwho created the myth of the god-man. It \nexisted for many centuries before his birth. \nHe himself was seized by this symbolic idea, \nwhich, as St. Mark tells us, lifted him out of \nthe narrow life of the Nazarene carpenter.\n\f\nMyths go back to the primitive storyteller \nand his dreams, to men moved by the stirring \nof their fantasies. These people were not very \ndifferent from those whom later generations \nhave called poets or philosophers. Primitive \nstorytellers did not concern themselves with \nthe origin of their fantasies; it was very much \nlater that people began to wonder where a \nstory originated. Vet. centuries ago, in what \nwe now call \"ancient\"\" Greece, men's minds \nwere advanced enough to surmise that the \ntales of the gods were nothing but archaic \nand exaggerated traditions of long-buried kings \nor chieftains. Men already took the view that \nthe myth was too improbable to mean what it \nsaid. They therefore tried to reduce it to a \ngenerally understandable form. \nIn more recent times, we have seen the same \nthing happen with dream symbolism. We \nbecame aware, in the years when psychology \nwas in its infancy, that dreams had some \nimportance. But just as the Greeks persuaded \nthemselves that their myths were merely elab­\norations of rational or \"normal\" history, so \nsome of the pioneers of psychology came to the \nconclusion that dreams did not mean what they \nappeared to mean. The images or symbols that \nthey presented were dismissed as bizarre forms \nin which repressed contents of the psyche \nappeared to the conscious mind. It thus came \nto be taken for granted that a dream meant \nsomething other than its obvious statement. \nI have already described my disagreement \nwith this idea — a disagreement that led mc \nto study the form as well as the content of \ndreams. Why should they mean something \ndifferent from their contents? Is there any­\nthing in nature that is other than it is? The \ndream is a normal and natural phenomenon, \nand it does not mean something it is not. The \nTalmud even says: \"The dream is its own \ninterpretation.\" The confusion arises because \nthe dream's contents are symbolic and thus \nhave more than one meaning. The symbols \npoint in different directions from those we \napprehend with the conscious mind; and there­\nfore they relate to something either unconscious \nor at least not entirely conscious. \nAbove, a child's drawing of a tree \n(with the sun above it). A tree is \none of the best examples of a motif \nthat often appears in dreams (and \nelsewhere) and that can have an \nincredible variety of meanings. It \nmight symbolize evolution, physical \ngrowth, or psychological maturation; \nit might symbolize sacrifice or \ndeath (Christ's crucifixion on the \ntree); it might be a phallic symbol; \nit might be a great deal more. And \nsuch other common dream motifs \nas the cross (right) or the  lingam \n(far right) can also have a vast \narray of symbolic meanings. \n'I\""

    "raw_text": "To the scientific mind, such phenomena as \nsymbolic ideas are a nuisance because they \ncannot be formulated in a way that is satis­\nfactory to intellect and logic. They are by no \nmeans the only case of this kind in psychology. \nThe trouble begins with the phenomenon of \n\"affect\" or emotion, which evades all the \nattempts of the psychologist to pin it down \nwith a final definition. The cause of the diffi­\nculty is the same in both cases — the interven­\ntion of the unconscious. \nI know enough of the scientific point of \nview to understand that it is most annoying to \nhave to deal with facts that cannot be com­\npletely or adequately grasped. The trouble with \nthese phenomena is that the facts are un­\ndeniable and yet cannot be formulated in \nintellectual terms. For this one would have to be \nable to comprehend life itself, for it is life that \nproduces emotions and symbolic ideas. \nThe academic psychologist is perfectly free \nto dismiss the phenomenon of emotion or the \nconcept of the unconscious (or both) from his \nconsideration. Yet they remain facts to which \nthe medical psychologist at least has to pay \ndue attention; for emotional conflicts and the \nintervention of the unconscious are the classical \nfeatures of his science. If he treats a patient at \nall, he comes up against these irrationalities as \nhard facts, irrespective of his ability to formu­\nlate them in intellectual terms. It is. therefore, \nepiite natural that people who have not had the \nmedical psychologist's experience find it diffi­\ncult to follow what happens when psychology \nceases to be a tranquil pursuit for the scientist \nin his laboratory and becomes an active part \nof the adventure of real life. Target practice \non a shooting range is far from the battlefield; \nthe doctor has to deal with casualties in a \ngenuine war. He must concern himself with \npsychic realities, even if he cannot embody \nthem in scientific definitions. That is why no \ntextbook can teach psychology; one learns only \nby actual experience. \nWe can see this point clearly when we \nexamine certain well-known symbols: \nThe cross in the Christian religion, for in­\nstance, is a meaningful symbol that expresses \na multitude of aspects, ideas, and emotions: \nbut a cross after a name on a list simply indi­\ncates that the individual is dead. The phallus \nfunctions as an all-embracing symbol in the \nHindu religion, but if a street urchin draws \none on a wall, it just reflects an interest in his \npenis. Because infantile and adolescent fan­\ntasies often continue far into adult life, many \ndreams occur in which there are unmistakable \nsexual allusions. It would be absurd to under-\n9i\n\f\nstand them as anything else. But when a mason \nspeaks of monks and nuns to be laid upon \neach other, or an electrician of male plugs and \nfemale sockets, it would be ludicrous to \nsuppose that he is indulging in glowing adoles­\ncent fantasies. He is simply using colorful \ndescriptive names for his materials. When an \neducated Hindu talks to you about the lin-\ngam (the phallus that represents the god Siva \nin Hindu mythology), you will hear things \nwe Westerners would never connect with the \npenis. The lingam is certainly not an obscene \nallusion; nor is the cross merely a sign of \ndeath. Much depends upon the maturity of \nthe dreamer who produces such an image. \nThe interpretation of dreams and symbols \ndemands intelligence. It cannot be turned into \na mechanical system and then crammed into \nunimaginative brains. It demands both an \nincreasing knowledge of the dreamer's indi­\nviduality and an increasing self-awareness \non the part of the interpreter. No experienced \nworker in this field will deny that there are \nrules of thumb that can prove helpful, but they \nmust be applied with prudence and intelligence. \nOne may follow all the right rules and yet get \nbogged down in the most appalling nonsense, \nsimply by overlooking a seemingly unimportant \ndetail that a better intelligence would not have \nmissed. Even a man of high intellect can go \nbadly astray for lack of intuition or feeling. \nWhen we attempt to understand symbols, \nwe are not only confronted with the symbol \nitself, but we are brought up against the \nwholeness of the symbol-producing individual. \nThis includes a study of his cultural back­\nground, and in the process one fills in many \ngaps in one's own education. I have made it \na rule myself to consider every case as an \nentirely new proposition about which I do \nnot even know the ABC. Routine responses \nmay be practical and useful while one is deal­\ning with the surface, but as soon as one gets \nin touch with the vital problems, life itself \ntakes over and even the most brilliant theoreti­\ncal premises become ineffectual words. \nImagination and intuition are vital to our \nunderstanding. And though the usual popular \nopinion is that they are chiefly valuable to \npoets and artists (that in \"sensible\" matters one \nshould mistrust them), they are in fact equally \nvital in all the higher grades of science. Here \nthey play an increasingly important role, which \nsupplements that of the \"rational\" intellect and \nits application to a specific problem. Even \nphysics, the strictest of all applied sciences, \ndepends to an astonishing degree upon intui­\ntion, which works by way of the unconscious \n(although it is possible to demonstrate after­\nward the logical procedures that could have \nled one to the same result as intuition). \nIntuition is almost indispensable in the in­\nterpretation of symbols, and it can often ensure \nthat they are immediately understood by the \ndreamer. But while such a lucky hunch may be \nsubjectively convincing, it can also be rather \ndangerous. It can so easily lead to a false \nfeeling of security. It may, for instance, seduce \nboth the interpreter and the dreamer into \ncontinuing a cosy and relatively easy relation, \nwhich may end in a sort of shared dream. \nThe safe basis of real intellectual knowledge \nand moral understanding gets lost if one is \ncontent with the vague satisfaction of having \nunderstood by \"hunch.\" One can explain and \nknow only if one has reduced intuitions to an \nexact knowledge of facts and their logical \nconnections. \nAn honest investigator will have to admit \nthat he cannot always do this, but it would \nbe dishonest not to keep it always in mind. \nEven a scientist is a human being. So it is \nnatural for him, like others, to hate the things \nhe cannot explain. It is a common illusion to \nbelieve that what we know today is all we \never can know. Nothing is more vulnerable \nthan scientific theory, which is an ephemeral \nattempt to explain facts and not an everlasting \ntruth in itself. \n92 \nAncient mythological beings are \nnow curiosities in museums (right). \nBut the archetypes they expressed \nhave not lost their power to affect \nmen's minds. Perhaps the monsters \nof modern \"horror\" films (far right) \nare distorted versions of archetypes \nthat will no longer be repressed."

    "raw_text": "The role of symbols \nWhen the medical psychologist takes an inter­\nest in symbols, he is primarily concerned with \n\"natural\" symbols, as distinct from \"cultural\" \nsymbols. The former are derived from the \nunconscious contents of the psyche, and they \ntherefore represent an enormous number of \nvariations on the essential archetypal images. \nIn many cases they can still be traced back \nto their archaic roots i.e. to ideas and images \nthat we meet in the most ancient records and \nin primitive societies. The cultural symbols, on \nthe other hand, are those that have been \nused to express \"eternal truths,\" and that are \nstill used in many religions. They have gone \nthrough many transformations and even a long \nprocess of more or less conscious development, \nand have thus become collective images \naccepted by civilized societies. \nSuch cultural symbols nevertheless retain \nmuch of their original numinosity or \"spell.\" \nOne is aware that they can evoke a deep emo­\ntional response in some individuals, and this \npsychic change makes them function in much \nthe same way as prejudices. They are a factor \nwith which the psychologist must reckon; it is \nfolly to dismiss them because, in rational terms, \nthey seem to be absurd or irrelevant. They are \nimportant constituents of our mental make-up \nand vital forces in the building up of human \nsociety; and they cannot be eradicated without \nserious loss. Where they are repressed or neg­\nlected, their specific cnergv disappears into the \nunconscious with unaccountable consequences. \nThe psychic energy that appears to have been \nlost in this way in fact serves to revive and in­\ntensify whatever is uppermost in the uncon­\nscious— tendencies, perhaps, that have hitherto \nhad no chance to express themselves or at least \nhave not been allowed an uninhibited existence \nin our consciousness. \nSuch tendencies form an ever-present and \npotentially destructive \"shadow\" to our con­\nscious mind. Even tendencies that might in \nsome circumstances be able to exert a beneficial \ninfluence are transformed into demons when \nthey are repressed. This is why many well-\nmeaning people are understandably afraid of \nthe unconscious, and incidentally of psychology. \nOur times have demonstrated what it means \nfor the gates of the underworld to be opened. \nThings whose enormity nobody could have \nimagined in the idyllic harmlessness of the first \ndecade of our century have happened and have \nturned our world upside down. Ever since, the \nworld has remained in a state of schizophrenia. \nNot only has civilized Germany disgorged its \n93\n\f\nterrible primitivity, but Russia is also ruled by \nit, and Africa has been set on fire. No wonder \nthat the Western world feels uneasy. \nModern man does not understand how much \nhis \"rationalism\" (which hasdestroyed his capa­\ncity to respond to numinous symbols and ideas I \nhas put him at the mercy of the psychic \n\"underworld.\" He has freed himself frqm \n\"superstition\" (orsohe believes), but in the pro­\ncess he has lost his spiritual values to a positively \ndangerous degree. His moral and spiritual tradi­\ntion has disintegrated, and he is now paying \nthe price for this break-up in world-wide dis­\norientation and dissociation. \nAnthropologists have often described what \nhappens to a primitive society when its spiritual \nvalues are exposed to the impact of modern \ncivilization. Its people lose the meaning of their \nlives, theirsocial organization disintegrates, and \nthey themselves morally decay. We are now in \nthe same condition. But we have never really \nunderstood what we have lost, for our spiritual \nleaders unfortunately were more interested in \nprotecting their institutions than in understand­\ning the mystery that symbols present. In my \nopinion, faith docs not exclude thought (which \nis man's strongest weapon), but unfortunately \nmany believers seem to be so afraid of science \n(and incidentally of psychology) that they turn \na blind eye to the numinous psychic powers \nthat forever control man's fate. We have strip­\nped all things of their mystery and numinosity : \nnothing is holy any longer. \nIn earlier ages, as instinctive concepts welled \nup in the mind of man, his conscious mind \ncould no doubt integrate them into a coherent \npsychic pattern. But the \"civilized\" man is no \nlonger able to do this. His \"advanced\" con­\nsciousness has deprived itself of the means by \nwhich the auxiliary contributions of the in­\nstincts and the unconscious can be assimilated. \nThese organs of assimilation and integration \nwere numinous symbols, held holy by common \nconsent. \nToday, for instance, we talk of \"matter.\" We \ndescribe its physical properties. We conduct \nlaboratory experiments to demonstrate some ol \nits aspects. But the word \"matter\" remains a \ndry, inhuman, and purely intellectual concept, \nwithout any psychic significance for us. How \ndifferent was the former image of matter the \nGreat Mother that could encompass and cx-\n94\n\f\npress the profound emotional meaning of \nMother Earth. In the same way, what was the \nspirit is now identified with intellect and thus \nceases to be the Father of All. It has degen­\nerated to the limited ego-thoughts of man; the \nimmense emotional energy expressed in the \nimage of \"our Father\" vanishes into the sand \nof an intellectual desert. \nThese two archetypal principles lie at the \nfoundation of the contrasting systems of East \nand West. The masses and their leaders do not \nrealize, however, that there is no substantial \ndifference between calling the world principle \nmale and a father (spirit), as the West does, or \nfemale and a mother (matter), as the Com­\nmunists do. Essentially, we know as little of the \none as of the other. In earlier times, these prin­\nciples were worshiped in all sorts of rituals, \nwhich at least showed the psychic significance \nthey held for man. But now they have become \nmere abstract concepts. \nAs scientific understanding has grown, so our \nworld has become dehumanized. Man feels him­\nself isolated in the cosmos, because he is no \nlonger involved in nature and has lost his emo­\ntional \"unconscious identity\" with natural phe­\nnomena. These have slowly lost their symbolic \nimplications. Thunder is no longer the voice of \nan angry god, nor is lightning his avenging \nmissile. No river contains a spirit, no tree is \nthe life principle of a man, no snake the embodi­\nment of wisdom, no mountain cave the home \nof a great demon. No voices now speak to \nman from stones, plants, and animals, nor does \nhe speak to them believing they can hear. His \ncontact with nature has gone, and with it has \ngone the profound emotional energy that this \nsymbolic connection supplied. \nThis enormous loss is compensated for by \nthe symbols of our dreams. They bring up our \noriginal nature its instincts and peculiar \nthinking. Unfortunately, however, they express \ntheir contents in the language of nature, which \nis strange and incomprehensible to us. It there­\nfore confronts us with the task of translating it \ninto the rational words and concepts of modern \nspeech, which has liberated itself from its primi­\ntive encumbrances notably from its mystical \nparticipation with the things it describes. Now­\nadays, when we talk of ghosts and other numi­\nnous figures, we are no longer conjuring them \nup. 'The power as well as the glory is drained \nout of such once-potent words. We have ceased \nto believe in magic formulas; not many taboos \nand similar restrictions are left; and our world \nseems to be disinfected of all such \"supersti­\ntious\" minima as \"witches, warlocks, and wor-\nricows,\" to say nothing ol werewolves, vampires, \nbush souls, and all the other bizarre beings that \npopulated the primeval forest. \nTo be more accurate, the surface of our \nworld seems to be cleansed ol all superstitious \nand irrational elements. Whether, however, the \nreal inner human world mil inn wish-fullilling \n95 \nRepressed unconscious contents can \nerupt destructively in the form of \nnegative emotions as in World War \nII Far left, Jewish prisoners in \nWarsaw after the 1 943 uprising; \nleft, footwear of the dead stacked \nat Auschwitz. \nRight, Australian aborigines who \nhave disintegrated since they lost \ntheir religious beliefs through \ncontact with civilization This tribe \nnow numbers only a few hundred\n\f\nfiction about it) is also freed from primitivity \nis another question. Is the number 13 not still \ntaboo for many people? Are there not still \nmany individuals possessed by irrational preju­\ndices, projections, and childish illusions? A rea­\nlistic picture of the human mind reveals many \nsuch primitive traits and survivals, which are \nstill playing their roles just as if nothing had \nhappened during the last 500 years. \nIt is essential to appreciate this point. Modern \nman is in fact a curious mixture of characteris­\ntics acquired over the long ages of his mental \ndevelopment. This mixed-up being is the man \nand his symbols that we have to deal with, and \nwe must scrutinize his mental products very \ncarefully indeed. Skepticism and scientific con­\nviction exist in him side by side with old-fash­\nioned prejudices, outdated habits of thought \nand feeling, obstinate misinterpretations, and \nblind ignorance. \nSuch are the contemporary human beings \nwho produce the symbols we psychologists in­\nvestigate. In order to explain these symbols \nand their meaning, it is vital to learn whether \ntheir representations are related to purely per­\nsonal experience, or whether they have been \nchosen by a dream for its particular purpose \nfrom a store of general conscious knowledge. \nTake, for instance, a dream in which the \nnumber 13 occurs. The question is whether the \ndreamer himself habitually believes in the un­\nlucky quality of the number, or whether the \ndream merely alludes to people who still in­\ndulge in such superstitions. The answer makes \na great difference to the interpretation. In the \nformer case, you have to reckon with the fact \nthat the individual is still under the spell of the \nunlucky 13, and therefore will feel most un­\ncomfortable in Room 13 in a hotel or sitting \nat a table with 13 people. In the latter case, 13 \nmay not mean any more than a discourteous or \nabusive remark. The \"superstitious\" dreamer \nstill feels the \"spell\" of 13; the more \"rational\" \ndreamer has stripped 13 of its original emo­\ntional overtones. \nThis argument illustrates the way in which \narchetypes appear in practical experience: \nThey are, at the same time, both images and \nemotions. One can speak of an archetype only \nwhen these two aspects are simultaneous. When \nthere is merely the image, then there is simply \na word-picture of little consequence. But by \nbeing charged with emotion, the image gains \nnuminosity (or psychic energy); it becomes \ndynamic, and consequences of some kind must \nflow from it. \nI am aware that it is difficult to grasp this \nconcept, because I am trying to use words to \ndescribe something whose very nature makes it \nincapable of precise definition. But since so \nmany people have chosen to treat archetypes \nas if they were part of a mechanical system \nthat can be learned by rote, it is essential to \ninsist that they are not mere names, or even \nphilosophical concepts. They are pieces of life \nitself- images that are integrally connected to \nthe living individual by the bridge of the \nemotions. That is why it is impossible to give \nan arbitrary (or universal) interpretation of any \narchetype. It must be explained in the manner \nindicated by the whole life-situation of the par­\nticular individual to whom it relates. \nThus, in the case of a devout Christian, the \nsymbol of the cross can be interpreted only in \nits Christian context — unless the dream pro­\nduces a very strong reason to look beyond it. \nEven then, the specific Christian meaning \nshould be kept in mind. But one cannot say \nthat, at all times and in all circumstances, the \nsymbol of the cross has the same meaning. If \nthat were so, it would be stripped of its numin­\nosity, lose its vitality, and become a mere word. \nThose who do not realize the special feeling \ntone of the archetype end with nothing more \nthan a jumble of mythological concepts, which \ncan be strung together to show that everything \nmeans anything — or nothing at all. All the \ncorpses in the world are chemically identical, \nbut living individuals are not. Archetypes come \nto life only when one patiently tries to discover \nwhy and in what fashion they are meaningful \nto a living individual. \nThe mere use of words is futile when you do \nnot know what they stand for. This is particu­\nlarly true in psychology, where we speak of arche­\ntypes such as the anima and animus, the wise \n96\n\f\nThe ancient Chinese connected the \nmoon with the goddess Kwan-Yin \n(pictured above) Other societies \nhave personified the moon as a \ndivinity. And though modern space \nflight has proved that the moon is \nonly a cratered ball of dirt (left), \nwe have retained something of the \narchetypal attitude in our familiar \nassociation of the moon with love \nand romance \n97\n\f\nIn a child's unconscious we can see \nthe power (and universality) of \narchetypal symbols A seven-year-\nold's painting (left) —a huge sun \ndriving away black birds, demons \nof the night—has the flavor of a \ntrue myth Children at play (right) \nspontaneously dance in as natural \na form of self-expression as the \nceremonial dances of primitives. \nAncient folklore still exists in \nchildren's \"ritual\" beliefs: For \ninstance, children all over Britain \n(and elsewhere) believe it is lucky \nto see a white horse—which is a \nwell-known symbol of life A Celtic \ngoddess of creativity, Epona, shown \n(far right) riding a horse, was often \npersonified as a white mare. \nman. the Great Mother, and so on. You can \nknow all about the saints, sages, prophets, and \nother godly men, and all the great mothers of \nthe world. But if they are mere images whose \nnuminosity you have never experienced, it will \nbe as if you were talking in a dream, for you \nwill not know what you are talking about. The \nmere words you use will be empty and valueless. \nThey gain life and meaning only when you \ntry to take into account their numinosity — i.e. \ntheir relationship to the living individual. Only \nthen do you begin to understand that their \nnames mean very little, whereas the way they \nare related to you is all-important. \nThe symbol-producing function of our \ndreams is thus an attempt to bring the original \nmind of man into \"advanced'\" or differentiated \nconsciousness, where it has never been before \nand where, therefore, it has never been sub­\njected to critical self-reflection. For, in ages long \npast, that original mind was the whole of man's \npersonality. As he developed consciousness, so \nhis conscious mind lost contact with some of \nthat primitive psychic energy. And the consci­\nous mind has never known that original mind; \nfor it was discarded in the process of evolving \nthe very differentiated consciousness that alone \ncould be aware of it. \nYet it seems that what we call the uncon­\nscious has preserved primitive characteristics \nthat formed part of the original mind. It is to \nthese characteristics that the symbols of dreams \nconstantly refer, as if the unconscious sought to \nbring back all the old things from which the \nmind freed itself as it evolved illusions, fanta­\nsies, archaic thought forms, fundamental in­\nstincts, and so on. \nThis is what explains the resistance, even \nfear, that people often experience in approach­\ning unconscious matters. These relict contents \nare not merely neutral or indifferent. On the \ncontrary, they are so highly charged that they \nare often more than merely uncomfortable. \nThey can cause real fear. The more they are \nrepressed, the more they spread through the \nwhole personality in the form of a neurosis. \nIt is this psychic energy that gives them such \nvital importance. It is just as if a man who has \nlived through a period of unconsciousness \nshould suddenly realize that there is a gap in \nhis memory — that important events seem to \nhave taken place that he cannot remember. In \nso far as he assumes that the psyche is an ex­\nclusively personal affair (and this is the usual \nassumption), he will try to retrieve the appar­\nently lost infantile memories. But the gaps in \nhis childhood memory are merely the symp­\ntoms of a much greater loss the loss of the \nprimitive psyche. \nAs the evolution of the embryonic body re­\npeats its prehistory, so the mind also develops \nthrough a series of prehistoric stages. The main \n98\n\f\ntask of dreams is to bring bark a sort bf \"recol­\nlection\" of the prehistoric, as well as the infan­\ntile world, right down to the level of the most \nprimitive instincts. Such recollections can have \na remarkably healing effect in certain cases, as \nFreud saw long ago. This observation confirms \nthe view that an infantile memory gap (a so-\ncalled amnesia) represents a positive loss and \nits recovery can bring a positive increase in life \nand well-being. \nBecause a child is physically small and its \nconscious thoughts are scarce and simple, we \ndo not realize the far-reaching complications ol \nthe infantile mind that are based on its original \nidentity with the prehistoric psyche. That \n\"original mind\" is just as much present and \nstill functioning in the child as the evolutionary \nstages of mankind are in its embryonic body. \nII the reader remembers what I said earlier \nabout the remarkable dreams ol the child who \nmade a present of her dreams to her father, he \nwill get a good idea of what 1 mean. \nIn infantile amnesia, one findsstrange mytho­\nlogical fragments that also often appear in later \npsychoses. Images of this kind are highly numi­\nnous and therefore verv important. If such re­\ncollections reappear in adult life, they may in \nsome cases cause profound psychological dis­\nturbance, while in other people they can pro­\nduce miracles of healing or religious conver­\nsions. Often they bring back a piece of life, \nmissing for a long time, that gives purpose to \nand thus enriches human life. \nThe recollection of infantile memories and \nthe reproduction of archetypal ways of psychic \nbehavior can create a wider horizon and a \ngreater extension of consciousness on condi­\ntion that one succeeds in assimilating and inte­\ngrating in the conscious mind the lost and \nregained contents. Since they arc not neutral, \ntheir assimilation will modify the personality, \njust as they themselves will have to undergo \ncertain alterations. In this part of what is called \n\"the individuation process\" (which Dr. M.-L. \nvon Franz describes in a later section of this \nbook), the interpretation of svmbols plavs an \nimportant practical role. For the symbols are \nnatural attempts to reconcile and unite oppo-\nsites within the psyche. \nNaturally, just seeing and then brushing aside \nthe symbols would have no such effect and \nwould merely re-establish the old neurotic con­\ndition and destroy the attempt at a synthesis. \nBttt. unfortunately, those rare people who do \nnot deny the very existence of the archetypes \nalmost invariably treat them as mere words and \nforget their living reality. When their numino­\nsity has thus (illegitimately) been banished, the \nprocess of limitless substitution begins in other \nwords, one glides easily from archetype to \narchetype, with everything meaning every­\nthing. It is true enough that the forms of arche­\ntypes are to a considerable extent exchangeable. \nBut their numinosity is and remains a fact, and \nrepresents the value of an archetypal event. \nThis emotional value must be kept in mind \nand allowed for throughout the whole intel­\nlectual process of dream interpretation. It is \nonly too easy to lose this value, because think­\ning and feeling are so diametrically opposed \nthat thinking almost automatically throws out \nfeeling values and vice versa. Psychology is the \nonly science that has to take the factor of value \n(i.e. feeling) into account, because it is the link \nbetween physical events and life. Psychology \nis often accused of not being scientific on this \naccount; but its critics fail to understand the \nscientific and practical necessity of giving due \nconsideration to feeling. \n9<)\n\f\nIOO\n\f\nHealing the split \nOur intellect has created a new world that \ndominates nature, and has populated it with \nmonstrous machines. The latter are so indu­\nbitably useful that we cannot see even a possi­\nbility of getting rid of them or our subservience \nto them. Man is bound to follow the adventur­\nous promptings of his scientific and inventive \nmind and to admire himself for his splendid \nachievements. At the same time, his genius \nshows the uncanny tendency to invent things \nthat become more and more dangerous, be­\ncause they represent better and better means \nfor wholesale suicide. \nIn view of the rapidly increasing avalanche \nof world population, man has already begun to \nseek ways and means of keeping the rising flood \nat bay. But nature may anticipate all our \nattempts by turning against man his own cre­\native mind. The H-bomb, for instance, would \nput an effective stop to overpopulation. In spite \nof our proud domination of nature, we are still \nher victims, for we have not even learned to \ncontrol our own nature. Slowly but, it appears, \ninevitably, we are courting disaster. \nThere are no longer any gods whom we can \ninvoke to help us. The great religions of the \nworld suffer from increasing anemia, because \nthe helpful numina have fled from the woods, \nrivers, and mountains, and from animals, and \nthe god-men have disappeared underground \ninto the unconscious. There we fool ourselves \nAbove left, the 20th century's \ngreatest city—New York. Below, \nthe end of another city—Hiroshima, \n1945. Though man may seem to have \ngained ascendance over nature, \nJung always pointed out that man \nhas not yet gained control over \nhis own nature. \nthat they lead an ignominious existence among \nthe relics of our past. Our present lives are \ndominated by the goddess Reason, who is our \ngreatest and most tragic illusion. By the aid of \nreason, so we assure ourselves, we have \"con­\nquered nature.\" \nBut this is a mere slogan, for the so-called \nconquest of nature overwhelms us with the \nnatural fact of overpopulation and adds to our \ntroubles by our psychological incapacity to \nmake the necessary political arrangements. It \nremains quite natural for men to quarrel and \nto struggle for superiority over one another. \nHow then have we \"conquered nature\"? \nAs any change must begin somewhere, it is \nthe single individual who will experience it and \ncarry it through. The change must indeed be­\ngin with an individual; it might be any one of \nus. Nobody can afford to look around and to \nwait for somebody else to do what he is loath to \ndo himself. But since nobody seems to know \nwhat to do, it might be worth while for each of \nus to ask himself whether by any chance his or \nher unconscious may know something that will \nhelp us. Certainly the conscious mind seems \nunable to do anything useful in this respect. \nMan today is painfully aware of the fact that \nneither his great religions nor his various philo­\nsophies seem to provide him with those power­\nful animating ideas that would give him the \nsecurity he needs in face of the present condi­\ntion of the world. \nI know what the Buddhists would say: \nThings would go right if people would only \nfollow the \"noble eightfold path\" of the \nDharma (doctrine, law) and had true insight \ninto the Self The Christian tells us that if only \npcople had faith in God, we should have a \nbetter world. The rationalist insists that if \npeople were intelligent and reasonable, all our \nproblems would be manageable. The trouble \nis that none of them manages to solve these \nproblems himself \nIOI\n\f\nChristians often ask why God does not speak \nto them, as he is believed to have done in for­\nmer days. When I hear such questions, it always \nmakes me think of the rabbi who was asked \nhow it could be that God often showed himself \nto people in the olden days whereas nowadays \nnobody ever sees him. The rabbi replied: \n\"Nowadays there is no longer anybody who \ncan bow low enough.\" \nThis answer hits the nail on the head. We \nare so captivated by and entangled in our sub­\njective consciousness that we have forgotten the \nage-old fact that God speaks chiefly through \ndreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the \nworld of unconscious fantasies as useless illu­\nsions; the Christian puts his Church and his \nBible between himself and his unconscious; \nand the rational intellectual does not yet know \nthat his consciousness is not his total psyche. \nThis ignorance persists today in spite of the \nfact that for more than 70 years the uncon­\nscious has been a basic scientific concept that \nis indispensable to any serious psychological \ninvestigation. \nWe can no longer afford to be so God-\nAlmighty-like as to set ourselves up as judges \nof the merits or demerits of natural phenomena. \nWe do not base our botany upon the old-\nfashioned division into useful and useless plants, \nor our zoology upon the naive distinction be­\ntween harmless and dangerous animals. But we \nstill complacently assume that consciousness is \nsense and the unconscious is nonsense. In science \nsuch an assumption would be laughed out of \ncourt. Do microbes, for instance, make sense \nor nonsense? \nWhatever the unconscious may be, it is a \nnatural phenomenon producing symbols that \nprove to be meaningful. We cannot expect \nsomeone who has never looked through a micro­\nscope to be an authority on microbes; in the \nsame way, no one who has not made a serious \nstudy of natural symbols can be considered a \ncompetent judge in this matter. But the general \nundervaluation of the human soul is so great \nthat neither the great religions nor the philoso­\nphies nor scientific rationalism have been will­\ning to look at it twice. \nIn spite of the fact that the Catholic Church \nadmits the occurrence of somma a Deo missa \n(dreams sent by God), most of its thinkers \nmake no serious attempt to understand dreams. \nI doubt whether there is a Protestant treatise or \ndoctrine that would stoop so low as to admit \nthe possibility that the vox Dei might be per­\nceived in a dream. But if a theologian really \nbelieves in God, by what authority does he \nsuggest that God is unable to speak through \ndreams? \nI have spent more than half a century in \ninvestigating natural symbols, and I have come \nto the conclusion that dreams and their symbols \nare not stupid and meaningless. On the con­\ntrary, dreams provide the most interesting in­\nformation for those who take the trouble to \nunderstand their symbols. The results, it is true, \nhave little to do with such worldly concerns \nas buying and selling. But the meaning of life \nis not exhaustively explained by one's business \nlife, nor is the deep desire of the human heart \nanswered by a bank account. \nIn a period of human history when all avail­\nable energy is spent in the investigation of \nnature, very little attention is paid to the essence \nof man, which is his psyche, although many \nresearches are made into its conscious functions. \nBut the really complex and unfamiliar part of \nthe mind, from which symbols are produced, \nis still virtually unexplored. It seems almost in­\ncredible that though we receive signals from it \nevery night, deciphering these communications \nseems too tedious for any but a very few people \nto be bothered with it. Man's greatest instru­\nment, his psyche, is little thought of, and it is \noften directly mistrusted and despised. \"It's \nonly psychological\" too often means: It is \nnothing. \nWhere, exactly, does this immense prejudice \ncome from ? We have obviously been so busy \nwith the question of what we think that we \nentirely forget to ask what the unconscious \npsyche thinks about us. The ideas of Sigmund \nFreud confirmed for most people the existing \ncontempt for the psyche. Before him it had been \nmerely overlooked and neglected; it has now \nbecome a dump for moral refuse. \n102\n\f\nThis modern standpoint is surely one-sided \nand unjust. It does not even accord with the \nknown facts. Our actual knowledge of the un­\nconscious shows that it is a natural phenomenon \nand that, like Nature herself, it is at least \nneutral. It contains all aspects of human nature \nlight and dark, beautiful and ugly, good and \nevil, profound and silly. The study of individual, \nas well as of collective, symbolism is an enor­\nmous task, and one that has not yet been mast­\nered. But a beginning has been made at last. \nThe early results are encouraging, and they \nseem to indicate an answer to many so far un­\nanswered questions of present-day mankind. \nAbove, Rembrandt's  Philosopher \nwith an Open Book  (1 633). The \ninward-looking old man provides an \nimage of Jung's belief that each of us \nmust explore his own unconscious. \nThe unconscious must not be ignored; \nit is as natural, as limitless, and \nas powerful as the stars. \nio3\n\f\nAncient myths and modern man \nJoseph L.

    "raw_text": "Ancient myths and modern man \nThe eternal symbols \nThe ancient history of man is being meaning­\nfully rediscovered today in the symbolic images \nand myths that have survived ancient man. As \narchaeologists dig deep into the past, it is less \nthe events of historical time that we learn to \ntreasure than the statues, designs, temples, and \nlanguages that tell of old beliefs. Other symbols \nare revealed to us by the philologists and reli­\ngious historians, who can translate these beliefs \ninto intelligible modern concepts. These in turn \nare brought to life by the cultural anthropolo­\ngists. They can show that the same symbolic \npatterns can be found in the rituals or myths of \nsmall tribal societies still existing, unchanged \nfor centuries, on the outskirts of civilization. \nAll such researches have done much to cor­\nrect the one-sided attitude ol those modern men \nwho maintain that such symbols belong to the \npeoples of antiquity or to \"backward\"\" modern \ntribes and are therefore irrelevant to the com­\nplexities of modern life. In London or New \nYork we may dismiss the fertility rites of neo­\nlithic man as archaic superstition. If anyone \nclaims to have seen a vision or heard voices, he \nis not treated as a saint or as an oracle. It is \nsaid he is mentally disturbed. We read the \nmyths of the ancient Greeks or the folk stories \nof American Indians, but we fail to see any \nconnection between them and our attitudes to \nthe \"heroes\" or dramatic events of today. \nYet the connections are there. And the sym­\nbols that represent them have not lost their re­\nlevance for mankind. \nOne of the main contributions of\" our time \nto the understanding and revaluing of such \neternal symbols has been made by Dr. Jung's \nSchool of Analytical Psychology. It has helped \nto break down the arbitrary distinction between \nprimitive man. to whom symbols seem a natural \npart of everyday life, and modern man, for \nwhom symbols are apparently meaningless and \nirrelevant. \nAs Dr. Jung has pointed out earlier in this \nbook, the human mind has its own history and \nthe psyche retains traces left from previ­\nous stages of its development. More than this, \nthe contents of the unconscious exert a forma­\ntive influence on the psyche. Consciously we\n\f\nmay ignore- them, hut unconsciously we respond \nto them, and to the symbolic forms including \ndreams—in which they express themselves. \nThe individual may feel that his dreams are \nspontaneous and disconnected. But over a long \nperiod of time the analyst can observe a series \nof dream images and note that they have a \nmeaningful pattern; and by understanding this \nhis patient may eventually acquire a new atti­\ntude to life. Some of the symbols in such \ndreams derive from what Dr. Jung has called \n\"the collective unconscious\" that is, the part \nof the psyche that retains and transmits the \ncommon psychological inheritance of mankind. \nThese symbols are so ancient and unfamiliar \nto modern man that he cannot directly under­\nstand or assimilate them. \nIt is here that the analyst can help. Possibly \nthe patient must be freed from the encumbrance \nof symbols that have grown stale and inappro­\npriate. Or possibly he must be assisted to dis­\ncover the abiding value of an old symbol that, \nfar from being dead, is seeking to be reborn in \nmodern form. \nBefore the analyst can effectively explore the \nmeaning of symbols with a patient, he must \nhimself acquire a wider knowledge of their \norigins and significance. For the analogies be­\ntween ancient myths and the stories that appear \nin the dreams of modern patients are neither \ntrivial nor accidental. They exist because the \nunconscious mind of modern man preserves the \nsymbol-making capacity that once found ex­\npression in the beliefs and rituals of the primi­\ntive. And that capacity still plays a role of vital \npsychic importance. In more ways than we re­\nalize, we are dependent on the messages that \nare carried by such symbols, and both our atti­\ntudes and our behavior are profoundly in­\nfluenced by them. \nIn wartime, for instance, one finds increased \ninterest in the works of Homer, Shakespeare, and \nTolstoi, and we read with a new understanding \nthose passages that give war its enduring (or \n\"archetypal\") meaning. They evoke a response \nfrom us that is much more profound than it \ncould be from someone who has never known \nthe intense emotional experience of war. The \nbattles on the plains of Troy were utterly un­\nlike the fighting at Agincourt or Borodino, yet \nthe great writers are able to transcend the \ndifferences of time and place and to express \nthemes that are universal. We respond because \nthese themes are fundamentally symbolic. \nA more striking example should be familiar \nto anyone who has grown up in a Christian \nsociety. At Christmas we may express our inner \nfeeling for the mythological birth of a semi-\n\\ \nFar left, a symbolic ceremony of \nantiquity in 20th-century form: The \nAmerican astronaut John Glenn in \na Washington parade after his orbit \nof the earth in 1962- like a hero \nof old, after a victory, returning \nhome in a triumphal procession \nCenter left, a cross-like sculpture \nof a Greek fertility goddess (c 2500 \nB.C.). Left, two views of 6 12th-\ncentury Scots stone cross that \nretains some pagan femaleness: \nthe \"breasts\" at the crossbar \nRight, another age old archetype \nreborn in a new guise: a Russian \nposter for an \"atheistic\" festival \nat Easter, to replace the Christian \nfestival |ust as the Christian \nEaster was superimposed on earlier \npagan solstice rites \ntoy\n\f\ndivine child, even though we may not believe \nin the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ or \nhave any kind of conscious religious faith. Un­\nknowingly, we have fallen in with the symbol­\nism of rebirth. This is a relic of an immensely \nolder solstice festival, which carries the hope \nthat the fading winter landscape of the northern \nhemisphere will be renewed. For all our sophis­\ntication we find satisfaction in this symbolic \nfestival, just as we join with our children at \nEaster in the pleasant ritual of Easter eggs and \nEaster rabbits. \nBut do we understand what we do, or see \nthe connection between the story of Christ's \nbirth, death, and resurrection and the folk \nsymbolism of Easter? Usually we do not even \ncare to consider such things intellectually. \nYet they complement each other. Christ's \ncrucifixion on Good Friday seems at first sight \nto belong to the same pattern of fertility sym­\nbolism that one finds in the rituals of such other \n\"saviors\" as Osiris, Tammuz, and Orpheus. \nThey, too, were of divine or semi-divine \nbirth, they flourished, were killed, and were \nreborn. They belonged, in fact, to cyclic reli­\ngions in which the death and rebirth of the \ngod-king was an eternally recurring myth. \nBut the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sun­\nday is much less satisfying from a ritual point \nof view than is the symbolism of the cyclic re­\nligions. For Christ ascends to sit at the right \nhand of God the Father: His resurrection \noccurs once and for all. \nIt is this finality of the Christian concept of \nthe resurrection (the Christian idea of the Last \nJudgment has a similar \"closed\" theme) that \ndistinguishes Christianity from other god-king \nmyths. It happened once, and the ritual merely \ncommemorates it. But this sense of finality is \nprobably one reason why early Christians, still \ninfluenced by pre-Christian traditions, felt that \nChristianity needed to be supplemented by \nsome elements of an older fertility ritual. They \nneeded the recurring promise of rebirth; and \nthat is what is symbolized by the egg and the \nrabbit of Easter. \nI have taken two quite different examples to \nshow how modern man continues to respond to \nprofound psychic influences of a kind that, con­\nsciously, he dismisses as little more than the \nfolk tales of superstitious and uneducated \npeoples. But it is necessary to go much further \nthan this. The more closely one looks at the \nhistory of symbolism, and at the role that sym-\nLeft, a 13th-century Japanese scroll \npainting of the destruction of a \ncity: below, similarly dominated \nby flame and smoke, St. Paul's \nCathedral, London, during an air \nraid in World War II Methods of \nwarfare have changed over the \nages, but the emotional impact of \nwar is timeless and archetypal."

    "raw_text": "bols have played in the life of many different \ncultures, the more one understands that there \nis also a re-creative meaning in these symbols. \nSome symbols relate to childhood and the \ntransition to adolescence, others to maturity, \nand others again to the experience of old age, \nwhen man is preparing for his inevitable death. \nDr. Jung has described how the dreams of a girl \nof eight contained the symbols one normally \nassociates with old age. Her dreams presented \naspects of initiation into life as belonging to the \nsame archetypal pattern as initiation into death. \nThis progression of symbolic ideas may take \nplace, therefore, within the unconscious mind \nof modern man just as it took place in the \nrituals of ancient societies. \nThis crucial link between archaic or primitive \nmyths and the symbols produced by the un­\nconscious is of immense practical importance to \nthe analyst. It enables him to identify and to \ninterpret these symbols in a context that gives \nthem historical perspective as well as psycholo­\ngical meaning. I shall now take some of the \nmore important myths of antiquity and show \nhow — and to what purpose — they are analo­\ngous to the symbolic material that we encoun­\nter in our dreams. \nTop left, Christ's nativity; center, \nhis crucifixion; bottom, his ascension. \nHis birth, death, and rebirth follows \nthe pattern of many ancient hero \nmyths—a pattern originally based on \nseasonal fertility rites like those \nprobably held 3000 years ago at \nEngland's Stonehenge (seen below \nat dawn at the summer solstice).\n\f\nHeroes and hero makers \nThe myth of the hero is the most common and \nthe best-known myth in the world. We find it \nin the classical mythology of Greece and Rome, \nin the Middle Ages, in the Far East, and among \ncontemporary primitive tribes. It also appears \nin our dreams. It has an obvious dramatic \nappeal, and a less obvious, but nonetheless pro­\nfound, psychological importance. \nThese hero myths vary enormously in detail, \nbut the more closely one examines them the \nmore one sees that structurally they are very \nsimilar. They have, that is to say, a universal \npattern, even though they were developed by \ngroups or individuals without any direct cul­\ntural contact with each other—by, for instance, \ntribes of Africans or North American Indians, \nor the Greeks, or the Incas of Peru. Over and \nover again one hears a tale describing a hero's \nmiraculous but humble birth, his early proof of \nsuperhuman strength, his rapid rise to promi­\nnence or power, his triumphant struggle with \nthe forces of evil, his fallibility to the sin of \npride (kybris), and his fall through betrayal or \na \"heroic\" sacrifice that ends in his death. \nI shall later explain in more detail why I be­\nlieve that this pattern has psychological mean­\ning both for the individual, who is endeavoring \nto discover and assert his personality, and for a \nwhole society, which has an equal need to \nestablish its collective identity. But another im­\nportant characteristic of the hero myth provides \na clue. In many of these stories the early weak­\nness of the hero is balanced by the appearance \nof strong \"tutelary\" figures or guardians -\nwho enable him to perform the superhuman \ntasks that he cannot accomplish unaided. \nAmong the Greek heroes, Theseus had Posei­\ndon, god of the sea, as his deity; Perseus had \nAthena; Achilles had Cheiron, the wise cen­\ntaur, as his tutor. \nThese godlike figures are in fact symbolic re­\npresentatives of the whole psyche, the larger \nThe hero's early proof of strength \noccurs in most hero myths Below, \nthe infant Hercules killing two \nserpents.

Their \nspecial role suggests that the essential function \nof the heroic myth is the development of the \nindividual's ego-consciousness — his awareness \nof his own strengths and weaknesses—in a man­\nner that will equip him for the arduous tasks \nwith which life confronts him. Once the indi­\nvidual has passed his initial test and can enter \nthe mature phase of life, the hero myth loses its \nrelevance. The hero's symbolic death becomes, \nas it were, the achievement of that maturity. \nI have so far been referring to the complete \nhero myth, in which the whole cycle from birth \nto death is elaborately described. But it is essen­\ntial to recognize that at each of the stages in \nthis cycle there are special forms of the hero \nstory that apply to the particular point reached \nby the individual in the development of his ego-\nconsciousness, and to the specific problem con­\nfronting him at a given moment. That is to \nsay, the image of the hero evolves in a manner \nthat reflects each stage of the evolution of the \nhuman personality. \nThis concept can be more easily understood \nif I present it in what amounts to a diagram. \nI take this example from the obscure North \nAmerican tribe of Winnebago Indians, because \nit sets out quite clearly four distinct stages in \nthe evolution of the hero. In these stories (which \nDr. Paul Radin published in 1948 under the \ntitle Hero Cycles of the Winnebago) we can see \nthe definite progression from the most primitive \nto the most sophisticated concept of the hero. \nThis progression is characteristic of other hero \ncycles. Though the symbolic figures in them \nnaturally have different names, their roles are \nsimilar, and we shall understand them better \nonce we have grasped the point made by this \nexample. \nDr. Radin noted four distinct cycles in the \nevolution of the hero myth. He named them the \nTrickster cycle, the Hare cycle, the Red Horn \ncycle, and the Twin cycle. He correctly per­\nceived the psychology of this evolution when he \nsaid: \"It represents our efforts to deal with the \nproblem of growing up, aided by the illusion of \nan eternal fiction.\" \nThe Trickster cycle corresponds to the earliest \nand least developed period of life. Trickster is \na figure whose physical appetites dominate his \nbehavior; he has the mentality of an infant. \nLacking any purpose beyond the gratification \nof his primary needs, he is cruel, cynical, and \nunfeeling. (Our stories of Brer Rabbit or Rey­\nnard the Fox preserve the essentials of the \nTrickster myth.) This figure, which at the out­\nset assumes the form of an animal, passes from \none mischievous exploit to another. But, as he-\ndoes so, a change comes over him. At the end \nof his rogue's progress he is beginning to take \non the physical likeness of a grown man. \nI I 2\n\f\nThe next figure is Hare. He also, like \nTrickster (whose animal traits are represented \namong some American Indians by a coyote), \nfirst appears in animal form. He has not yet \nattained mature human stature, but all the \nsame he appears as the founder of human \nculture—the Transformer. The Winnebago be­\nlieve that, in giving them their famous Medicine \nRite, he became their savior as well as their \nculture-hero. This myth was so powerful, Dr. \nRadin tells us, that the members of the Peyote \nRite were reluctant to give up Hare when \nChristianity began to penetrate the tribe. He \nbecame merged with the figure of Christ, and \nsome of them argued that they had no need of \nChrist since they already had Hare. This arche­\ntypal figure represents a distinct advance on \nTrickster: One can see that he is becoming a \nsocialized being, correcting the instinctual and \ninfantile urges found in the Trickster cycle. \nRed Horn, the third of this series of hero \nfigures, is an ambiguous person, said to be the \nyoungest of 10 brothers. He meets the require­\nments of an archetypal hero by passing such \ntests as winning a race and by proving himself \nin battle. His superhuman power is shown by \nhis ability to defeat giants by guile (in a game \nof dice) or by strength (in a wrestling match). \nHe has a powerful companion in the form of a \nthunderbird called \"Storms-as-he-walks,\" whose \nstrength compensates for whatever weakness \nRed Horn may display. With Red Horn we \nhave reached the world of man, though an \narchaic world, in which the aid of superhuman \npowers or tutelary gods is needed to ensure \nman's victory over the evil forces that beset him. \nToward the end of the story the hero-god de­\nparts, leaving Red Horn and his sons on earth. \nThe danger to man's happiness and security \nnow comes from man himself. \nThis basic theme (which is repeated in the \nlast cycle, that of the Twins) raises, in effect, \nthe vital question: How long can human be­\nings, be successful without falling victims to \ntheir own pride or, in mythological terms, to \nthe jealousy of the gods? \nThough the Twins are said to be the sons of \nthe Sun, they are essentially human and to­\ngether constitute a single person. Originally \nunited in the mother's womb, they were forced \napart at birth. Yet they belong together, and \nit is necessary — though exceedingly difficult— \nto reunite them. In these two children we see \nthe two sides of man's nature. One of them. \nFlesh, is acquiescent, mild, and without initia­\ntive; the other, Stump, is dynamic and rebel­\nlious. In some of the stories of the Twin Heroes \nthese attitudes arc refined to the point where \none figure represents the introvert, whose main \nstrength lies in his powers of reflection, and the \nother is an extravert, a man of action who can \naccomplish great deeds. \n\"Trickster\": the first, rudimentary \nstage in the development of the \nhero myth, in which the hero is \ninstinctual, uninhibited, and often \nchildish. Far left, the 16th-century \nChinese epic hero Monkey, shown \n(in a modern Peking opera) tricking \na river king into giving up a magic \nstaff. Left, on a sixth-century \nB.C. jar, the infant Hermes in his \ncradle after having stolen Apollo's \ncattle. Right, the trouble-making \nNorse god Loki (a 19th-century \nsculpture). Far right, Charlie \nChaplin creating a disturbance in \nthe 1936 film  Modern Times —a \n20th-century trickster. \n113\n\f\nFor a long time these two heroes are invin­\ncible: Whether they are presented as two sep­\narate figures or as two-in-one, they carry all \nbefore them. Yet, like the warrior gods of \nNavaho Indian mythology, they eventually \nsicken from the abuse of their own power. There \nare no monsters left in heaven or on earth for \nthem to overcome, and their consequent wild \nbehavior brings retribution in its train. The \nWinnebago say that nothing, in the end, was \nsafe from them — not even the supports on which \nthe world rests. When the Twins killed one of \nthe four animals that upheld the earth, they \nhad overstepped all limits, and the time had \ncome to put a stop to their career. The punish­\nment they deserved was death. \nThus, in both the Red Horn cycle and that of \nthe Twins, we see the theme of sacrifice or \ndeath of the hero as a necessary cure for hybris, \nthe pride that has over-reached itself. In the \nprimitive societies whose levels of culture cor­\nrespond to the Red Horn cycle, it appears that \nthis danger may have been forestalled by the \ninstitution of propitiatory human sacrifice — a \ntheme that has immense symbolic importance \nand recurs continually in human history. The \nWinnebago, like the Iroquois and a few Algon­\nquin tribes, probably ate human flesh as a tote-\nmic ritual that could tame their individualistic \nand destructive impulses. \nIn the examples of the hero's betrayal or de­\nfeat that occur in European mythology, the \ntheme of ritual sacrifice is more specifically em­\nployed as a punishment for hybris. But the \nWinnebago, like the Navaho, do not go so far. \nThough the Twins erred, and though the \npunishment should have been death, they \nthemselves became so frightened by their irre­\nsponsible power that they consented to live in a \nstate of permanent rest: The conflicting sides \nof human nature were again in equilibrium. \nI have given this description of the four types \nof hero at some, length because it provides a \nclear demonstration of the pattern that occurs \nboth in the historic myths and in the hero \ndreams of contemporary man. With this in mind \nwe can examine the following dream of a \nmiddle-aged patient. The interpretation of this \ndream shows how the analytical psychologist \ncan, from his knowledge of mythology, help his \npatient find an answer to what might otherwise \nseem an insoluble riddle. This man dreamed he-\nwas at a theatre, in the role of \"an important \nspectator whose opinion is respected.\" There-\nwas an act in which a white monkey was stand­\ning on a pedestal with men around him. In \nrecounting his dream the man said : \nMy guide explains the theme to me.' It is the \nordeal of a voting sailor who is exposed both to \nThe second stage in the evolution \nof the hero is the founder of human \nculture. Left, a Navaho sand painting \nof the myth of Coyote, who stole \nfire from the gods and gave it to \nman. In Greek myth Prometheus also \nstole fire from the gods for man — \nfor which he was chained to a rock \nand tortured by an eagle (below, \non a sixth-century B.c cup).\n\f\nThe hero in the third stage is a \npowerful man-god — like Buddha. In \nthe first-century sculpture above, \nSiddhartha begins the journey on \nwhich he will receive enlightenment \nand become Buddha. \nBelow left, a medieval Italian \nsculpture of Romulus and Remus, \nthe twins (raised by a wolf) who \nfounded Rome—and who are the \nbest-known instance of the fourth \nstage of the hero myth. \nIn the fourth stage, the Twins \noften misuse their power—as did \nthe Roman heroes Castor and Pollux \nwhen they abducted the daughters \nof Leucippus (below, in a painting \nby the Flemish artist Rubens).\n\f\nthe wind and to being beaten up. I begin to \nobject that this white monkey is not a sailor at \nall; but just at that moment a young man in \nblack stands up and I think that he must be the \ntrue hero. But another handsome young man \nstrides toward an altar and stretches himself out \non it. They are making marks on his bare chest \nas a preparation to offering him as a human \nsacrifice. \nThen I find myself on a platform with several \nother people. We could get down by a small \nladder, but I hesitate to do so because there are \ntwo young toughs standing by and I think that \nthey will stop us. But when a woman in the group \nuses the ladder unmolested, I see that it is safe \nand all of us follow the woman down. \nNow a dream of this kind cannot be quickly \nor simply interpreted. We have to unravel it \ncarefully in order to show both its relation to \nthe dreamer's own life and its wider symbolic \nimplications. The patient who produced it was \na man who had achieved maturity in a physical \nsense. He was successful in his career, and he \nhad apparently done pretty well as a husband \nand father. Yet psychologically he was still \nimmature, and had not completed his youthful \nphase of development. It was this psychic imma­\nturity that expressed itselfin his dreams as differ­\nent aspects of the hero myth. These images still \nexerted a strong attraction for his imagination \neven though they had long since exhausted any \nof their meaning in terms of the reality of his \neveryday life. \nThus, in a dream, we see a series of figures \ntheatrically presented as various aspects of a \nfigure that the dreamer keeps expecting will \nturn out to be the true hero. The first is a white \nmonkey, the second a sailor, the third a young \nman in black, and the last a \"handsome young \nman.\" In the early part of the performance, \nwhich is supposed to represent the sailor's \nordeal, the dreamer sees only the white mon­\nkey. The man in black suddenly appears and as \nsuddenly disappears; he is a new figure who \nfirst contrasts with the white monkey and is then \nfor a moment confused with the hero proper. \n(Such confusion in dreams is not unusual. The \ndreamer is not usually presented with clear \nimages by the unconscious. He has to puzzle out \na meaning from a succession of contrasts and \nparadoxes.) \nSignificantly, these figures appear in the \ncourse of a theatrical performance, and this \ncontext seems to be a direct reference by the \ndreamer to his own treatment by analysis: The \n\"guide\" he mentions is presumably his analyst. \nYet he does not see himself as a patient who is \nbeing treated by a doctor but as \"an important \nspectator whose opinion is respected.\" This is \nthe vantage point from which he sees certain \nfigures whom he associates with the experience \nAn individual psyche develops (as \ndoes the hero myth) from a primitive, \nchildish stage—and often images \nof the early stages can appear in the \ndreams of psychologically immature \nadults. The first stage might be \nrepresented by the carefree play \nof children — like the pillow fight \n(far left) from the 1 933 French film \nZero de Conduite.  The second \nstage might be the reckless thrill-\nseeking of early adolescence: Right, \nAmerican youths test their nerves \nin a speeding car. A later stage \ncan produce idealism, and self-\nsacrifice in late adolescence, \nexemplified in the picture (opposite, \nfar right) taken during the East Berlin \nrising (June 1953) when young men \nfought Russian tanks with stones. \nIlfi\n\f\nof growing up. The white monkey, for instance, \nreminds him of the playful and somewhat law­\nless behavior of boys between the'ages of seven \nand 12. The sailor suggests the adventurousness \nof early adolescence, together with the conse­\nquent punishment by \"beating\" for irrespon­\nsible pranks. The dreamer could offer no asso­\nciation to the young man in black, but in the \nhandsome young man about to be sacrificed he \nsaw a reminder of the self-sacrificing idealism \nof late adolescence. \nAt this stage it is possible to put together the \nhistorical material (or archetypal hero images) \nand the data from the dreamer's personal ex­\nperience in order to see how they corroborate, \ncontradict, or qualify each other. \nThe first conclusion is that the white monkey \nseems to represent Trickster or at least those \ntraits of personality that the Winnebago attri­\nbute to Trickster. But, to me, the monkey also \nstands for something that the dreamer has not \npersonally and adequately experienced for him­\nself— he in fact says that in the dream he was \na spectator. I found out that as a boy he had \nbeen excessively attached to his parents, and \nthat he was naturally introspective. For these \nreasons he had never fully developed the bois­\nterous qualities natural to late childhood; nor \nhad he joined in the games of his schoolfellows. \nHe had not, as the saying goes, \"got up to mon­\nkey tricks\" or practiced \"monkeyshines.\" The \nsaying provides the clue here. The monkey in \nthe dream is in fact a symbolic form of the \nTrickster figure. \nBut why should Trickster appear as a mon­\nkey? And why should it be white? As I have \nalready pointed out, the Winnebago myth tells \nus that, toward the end of the cycle, Trickster \nbegins to emerge in the physical likeness of a \nman. And here, in the dream, is a monkey-\nso close to a human being that it is a laughable \nand not too dangerous caricature of a man. \nThe dreamer himself could offer no personal \nassociation that could explain why the monkey \nwas white. But from our knowledge of primi­\ntive symbolism we can conjecture that white­\nness lends a special quality of \"god-likeness\" to \nthis otherwise banal figure. (The albino is re­\ngarded as sacred in many primitive communi­\nties.) This fits in quite well with Trickster's \nsemi-divine or semi-magical powers. \nThus, it seems, the white monkey symbolizes \nfor the dreamer the positive quality of child­\nhood playfulness, which he had insufficiently \naccepted at the time, and which he now feels \ncalled upon to exalt. As the dream tells us, he \nplaces it \"on a pedestal,\" where it becomes \nsomething more than a lost childhood experi­\nence. It is, for the adult man, a symbol of \ncreative experimentalism. \ni '7\n\f\nNext we come to the conclusion about the \nmonkey. Is it a monkey, or is it a sailor who \nhas to put up with beatings? The dreamer's \nown associations pointed to the meaning of this \ntransformation. But in any case the next stage \nin human development is one in which the irre­\nsponsibility of childhood gives way to a period \nof socialization, and that involves submission to \npainful discipline. One could say, therefore, \nthat the sailor is an advanced form of Trickster, \nwho is being changed into a socially responsible-\nperson by means of an initiation ordeal. Draw­\ning on the history of symbolism, we can assume-\nthat the wind represents the natural elements \nin this process, and the beatings are those that \nare humanly induced. \nAt this point, then, we have a reference to \nthe process that the Winnebago describe in the \nHare cycle, where the culture-hero is a weak \nyet struggling figure, ready to sacrifice childish­\nness for the sake of further development. Once \nagain, in this phase of the dream, the patient is \nacknowledging his failure to experience to the \nfull an important aspect of childhood and early \nadolescence. He missed out on the playfulness \nof the child, and also on the rather more ad­\nvanced pranks of the young teenager, and he \nis seeking ways in which those lost experiences \nand personal qualities can be rehabilitated. \nNext comes a curious change in the dream. \nThe young man in black appears, and for a \nmoment the dreamer feels that this is the \"true \nhero.\" That is all we are told about the man \nin black; yet this fleeting glimpse introduces a \ntheme of profound importance —a theme that \noccurs frequently in dreams. \nThis is the concept of the \"shadow,\" which \nplays such a vital role in analytical psychology. \nDr. Jung has pointed out that the shadow cast \nby the conscious mind of the individual con­\ntains the hidden, repressed, and unfavorable (or \nnefarious) aspects of the personality. But this \ndarkness is not jusl the simple ((inverse of the \nconscious ego. Just as the ego contains unfavor­\nable and destructive attitudes, so the shadow \nhas good qualities— normal instincts and \ncreative impulses. Ego and shadow, indeed, \nalthough separate, are inextricably linked to­\ngether in much the same way that thought and \nfeeling are related to each other. \nThe ego, nevertheless, is in conflict with the \nshadow, in what Dr. Jung once called \"the \nbattle for deliverance.\" In the struggle of \nprimitive man to achieve consciousness, this \nconflict is expressed by the contest between the \narchetypal hero and the cosmic powers of evil, \npersonified by dragons and other monsters. In \nthe developing consciousness of the individual \nthe hero figure is the symbolic means by which \nthe emerging ego overcomes the inertia of the \nunconscious mind, and liberates the mature \nThe young, undifferentiated ego-\npersonality is protected by the \nmother—a protection imaged by \nthe sheltering Madonna, left (in \na painting by the 1 5th-century \nItalian artist Piero della Francesca), \nor by the Egyptian sky goddess Nut, \nright, bending over the earth (in a \nfifth-century B.C. relief). But the \nego must eventually free itself from \nunconsciousness and immaturity; \nand its \"battle for deliverance\" is \noften symbolized by a hero's battle \nwith a monster—like the Japanese \ngod Susanoo's battle with a serpent, \ntop right (in a 19th-century print). \nThe hero doesn't always win at \nonce: For instance, Jonah was \nswallowed by the whale (far right, \nfrom a 14th-century manuscript).\n\f\n\"9\n\f\nman from a regressive longing to return to the \nblissful state of infancy in a world dominated \nby his mother. \nUsually, in mythology, the hero wins his \nbattle against the monster. (I shall say more \nabout this in a moment.) But there are other \nhero myths in which the hero gives in to the \nmonster. A familiar type is that of Jonah and \nthe whale, in which the hero is swallowed by a \nsea monster that carries him on a night sea \njourney from west to east, thus symbolizing the \nsupposed transit of the sun from sunset to \ndawn. The hero goes into darkness, which \nrepresents a kind of death. I have encountered \nthis theme in dreams presented in my own \nclinical experience. \nThe battle between the hero and the dragon \nis the more active form of this myth, and it \nshows more clearly the archetypal theme of the \nego's triumph over regressive trends. For most \npeople the dark or negative side of the person­\nality remains unconscious. The hero, on the \ncontrary, must realize that the shadow exists \nThe ego's emergence can be \nsymbolized not by a battle but by a \nsacrifice: death leading to rebirth. \nRevolution is sacrificial in this way: \nDelacroix's painting (below),  Greece \nexpiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi, \npersonifies the country killed by civil \nwar to be liberated and reborn. As \nindividual sacrifices: the British poet \nByron (above) died in Greece during \nthe revolution (1824). Below left, the \nChristian martyr St. Lucia sacrificed \nher eyes and her life for her religion.\n\f\nand that he can draw strength from it. He must \ncome to terms with its destructive powers if he \nis to become sufficiently terrible to overcome \nthe dragon i.e. before the ego can triumph, it \nmust master and assimilate the shadow. \nOne can see this theme, incidentally, in a \nwell-known literary hero figure (Joe t he's char­\nacter of Faust. In accepting the wager of \nMephistopheles. Faust put himself in the power \nof a \"shadow\"' figure that Goethe describes as \n'\"part of that power which, willing evil, finds \nthe good.\"' Like the man whose dream I have \nbeen discussing, Faust had failed to live out to \nthe full an important part of his early life. He-\nwas, accordingly, an unreal or incomplete per­\nson who lost himself in a fruitless quest for \nmetaphysical goals that failed to materialize. \nHe was still unwilling to accept life's challenge \nto live both the good and the bad. \nIt is to this aspect of the unconscious that the \nyoung man in black in my patient's dream \nseems to refer. Such a reminder of the shadow \nside of his personality, of its powerful potential \nand its role in preparing the hero for the strug­\ngles of life, is an essential transition from the \nearlier parts of the dream to the theme of the \nsacrificial hero: the handsome young man who \nplaces himself on an altar. I his figure repre­\nsents the form of heroism that is commonly \nassociated to the ego-building process of late \nadolescence. A man expresses the ideal prin­\nciples of his life at this time, sensing their power \nboth to transform himself and to change his re­\nlations with others. He is, so to speak, in the \nbloom of youth, attractive, full of energy and \nidealism. Why. then, does he willingly offer \nhimself as a human sacrifice? \nThe reason, presumably, is the same as that \nwhich made the Twins of the Winnebago myth \ngive up their power on pain of destruction. The \nidealism of youth, which drives one so hard, is \nbound to lead to over-confidence: The human \nego can be exalted to experience godlike attri­\nbutes, but only at the cost of over-reaching itself \nand falling to disaster. (This is the meaning of \nthe story of Icarus, the youth who is carried \nBelow, a montage of World War I \na call-to-arms poster, infantry, a \nmilitary cemetery. Memorials and \nreligious services for soldiers who \ngave their lives for their country \noften reflect the cyclic \"death and \nrebirth\" theme of the archetypal \nheroic sacrifice. An inscription \non one British memorial to the dead \nof World War I reads: \"At the going \ndown of the sun and in the morning \nwe will remember them.\" \nIn mythology, a hero's death is \noften due to his own  hybris,  which \ncauses the gods to humble him. As \na modern example: In 1 912 the \nship  Titanic  struck an iceberg and \nsank. (Right, a montage of scenes \nof the sinking, from the 1 943 film \nTitanic.) Yet the  Titanic  had been \ncalled \"unsinkable\": according to \nthe American author Walter Lord, \none sailor was heard to say, \"God \nhimself couldn't sink this ship!\"\n\f\nup to heaven on his fragile, humanly contrived \nwings, but who flies too close to the sun and \nplunges to his doom.) All the same, the youth­\nful ego must always run this risk, for if a young \nman does not strive for a higher goal than he \ncan safely reach, he cannot surmount the ob­\nstacles between adolescence and maturity. \nSo far, I have been talking about the con­\nclusions that, at the level of his personal asso­\nciations, my patient could draw from his own \ndream. Yet there is an archetypal level of the \ndream — the mystery of the proffered human \nsacrifice. It is precisely because it is a mystery \nthat it is expressed in a ritual act that, in its \nsymbolism, carries us a long way back into \nman's history. Here, as the man lies stretched \nout on an altar, we see a reference to an act \neven more primitive than those performed on \nthe altar stone in the temple at Stonehenge. \nThere, as on so many primitive altars, we can \nimagine a yearly solstice rite combined with \nthe death and rebirth of a mythological hero. \nThe ritual has a sorrow about it that is also \na kind of joy, an inward acknowledgment that \ndeath also leads to a new life. Whether it is \nexpressed in the prose epic of the Winnebago \nIndians, in a lament for the death of Balder in \nthe Norse eddas, in Walt Whitman's poems of \nmourning for Abraham Lincoln, or in the \ndream ritual whereby a man returns to his \nI 2 2\n\f\nHeroes often fight monsters to \nrescue \"damsels In distress\" (who \nsymbolize the anima).

Right, in the 1 916 film \nThe Great Secret,  the dragon has \nbecome a locomotive but the heroic \nrescue remains the same. \nyouthful hopes and fears, it is the same theme \n— the drama of new birth through death. \nThe end of the dream brings out a curious \nepilogue in which the dreamer at last becomes \ninvolved in the action of the dream. He and \nothers are on a platform from which they have \nto descend. He does not trust the ladder because \nof the possible interference of hoodlums, but \na woman encourages him to believe he can go \ndown safely and this is accomplished. Since I \nfound out from his associations that the whole \nperformance he witnessed was part of his \nanalysis —a process of inner change that he was \nexperiencing — he was presumably thinking of \nthe difficulty of getting back to everyday reality \nagain. His fear of the \"toughs,\" as he calls \nthem, suggests his fear that the Trickster arche­\ntype may appear in a collective form. \nThe saving elements in the dream are the \nman-made ladder, which here is probably a \nsymbol of the rational mind, and the presence \nof the woman who encourages the dreamer to \nuse it. Her appearance in the final sequence of \nthe dream points to a psychic need to include \na feminine principle as a complement to all \nthis excessively masculine activity. \nIt should not be assumed from what I have \nsaid, or from the fact that I have chosen to use \nthe Winnebago myth to illuminate this particu­\nlar dream, that one must seek for complete and \nwholly mechanical parallels between a dream \nand the materials one can find in the history of \nmythology. Each dream is individual to the \ndreamer, and the precise form it takes is deter­\nmined by his own situation. What I have \nsought to show is the manner in which the un­\nconscious draws on this archetypal material and \nmodifies its patterns to the dreamer's needs. \nThus, in this particular dream, one must not \nlook for a direct reference to what the Winne­\nbago describe in the Red Horn or Twin cycles; \nthe reference is rather to the essence of those \ntwo themes—to the sacrificial element in them. \nAs a general rule it can be said that the need \nfor hero symbols arises when the ego needs \nstrengthening when, that is to say, the con­\nscious mind needs assistance in some task that \nit cannot accomplish unaided or without draw­\ning on the sources of strength that lie in the un­\nconscious mind. In the dream I have been dis­\ncussing, for instance, there was no reference to \none of the more important aspects of the myth \nof the typical hero —his capacity to save or \nprotect beautiful women from terrible danger. \n(The damsel in distress was a favorite myth of \nmedieval Europe.) This is one way in which \nmyths or dreams refer to the \"anima\" — the \nfeminine element of the male psyche that \nGoethe called \"the Eternal Feminine.\" \nThe nature and function of this female ele­\nment will be discussed later in this book by Dr. \nvon Franz. But its relation to the hero figure \ncan be illustrated here by a dream produced \nby another patient, also a man of mature years. \nHe began by saying: \n\"I had returned from a long hike through \nIndia. A woman had equipped myself and a \nfriend for the journey, and on my return I \nreproached her for failing to give us black rain-\nhats, telling her that through this oversight we \nhad been soaked by the rain.\" \nThis introduction to the dream, it later \nemerged, referred to a period in this man's \nyouth when he was given to taking \"heroic\" \nwalks through dangerous mountain country in \ncompany with a college friend. (As he had \n123\n\f\nnever been to India, and in view of his own \nassociations to this dream, I concluded that the \ndream journey signified his exploration of a \nnew region —not, that is to say, a real place but \nthe realm of the unconscious.) \nIn his dream the patient seems to feel that \na woman — presumably a personification of his \nanima —has failed to prepare him properly for \nthis expedition. The lack of a suitable rainhat \nsuggests that he feels in an unprotected state of \nmind, in which he is uncomfortably affected by \nexposure to new and not altogether pleasant \nexperiences. He believes that the woman should \nhave provided a rainhat for him, just as his \nmother provided clothes for him to wear as a \nboy. This episode is reminiscent of his early \npicaresque wanderings, when he was sustained \nby the assumption that his mother (the original \nfeminine image) would protect him against all \ndangers. As he grew older, he saw that this was \na childish illusion, and he now blames his mis­\nfortune on his own anima, not his mother. \nIn the next stage of the dream the patient \nspeaks of participating in a hike with a group of \npeople. He grows tired and returns to an out­\ndoor restaurant where he finds his raincoat, to­\ngether with the rainhat that he had missed \nearlier. He sits down to rest; and, as he does so, \nhe notices a poster stating that a local high-\nschool boy is taking the part of Perseus in a \nplay. Then the boy in question appears — who \nturns out to be not a boy at all but a husky \nyoung man. He is dressed in gray with a black \nhat. and he sits down to talk with another \nyoung man dressed in a black suit. Immediately \nafter this scene the dreamer feels a new vigor, \nand finds that he is capable of rejoining his \nparty. They all then climb over the next hill. \nThere, below them, he sees their destination; it \nis a lovely harbor town. He feels both heartened \nand rejuvenated by the discovery. \nHere, in contrast to the restless, uncomfort­\nable, and lonely journey of the first episode, \nthe dreamer is with a group. The contrast \nmarks a change from an earlier pattern of \nisolation and youthful protest to the socializing \ninfluence of a relation to others. Since this im­\nplies a new capacity for relatedness, it suggests \nthat his anima must now be functioning better \nthan it was before —symbolized by his discov­\nery of the missing hat that the anima figure had \npreviously failed to provide for him. \nBut the dreamer is tired, and the scene at \nthe restaurant reflects his need to look at his \nearlier attitudes in a new light, with the hope \nof renewing his strength by this regression. And \nso it turns out. What he first sees is a poster \nsuggesting the enactment of a youthful hero \nrole a high-school boy playing the part of \nPerseus. Then he sees the boy, now a man, with \na friend who makes a sharp contrast to him. \nThe one dressed in light gray, the other in \nblack, can be recognized, from what I have \npreviously said, as a version of the Twins. They\n\f\nare hero-figures expressing the opposites of ego \nand alter-ego, which, however, appear here in \na harmonious and unified relation. \nThe patient's associations confirmed this and \nemphasized that the figure in gray represents a \nwell-adapted, worldly attitude to life, whereas \nthe figure in black represents the spiritual life, \nin the sense that a clergyman wears black. That \nthey wore hats (and he now had found his own) \npoints to their having achieved a relatively \nmature identity of a kind that he had felt to be \nseverely lacking in his own earlier adolescent \nyears, when the quality of \"Tricksterism\" still \nclung to him, in spite of his idealistic self-image \nas a seeker of wisdom. \nHis association to the Greek hero Perseus \nwas a curious one, which proved especially sig­\nnificant because it revealed a glaring inaccu­\nracy. It turned out that he thought Perseus was \nthe hero who slew the Minotaur and rescued \nAriadne from the Cretan labyrinth. As he wrote \nthe name down for me, he discovered his mis­\ntake—that it was Theseus, not Perseus, who \nslew the Minotaur —and this mistake became \nsuddenly meaningful, as such slips often do, by \nmaking him notice what these two heroes had \nin common. They both had to overcome their \nfear of unconscious demonic maternal powers \nand had to liberate from these powers a single \nyouthful feminine figure. \nPerseus had to cut off the head of the gorgon \nMedusa, whose horrifying visage and snaky \nlocks turned all who gazed upon them to stone. \nHe later had to overcome the dragon that \nguarded Andromeda. Theseus represented the \nyoung patriarchal spirit of Athens who had to \nbrave the terrors of the Cretan labyrinth with \nits monstrous inmate, the Minotaur, which per­\nhaps symbolized the unhealthy decadence of \nmatriarchal Crete. (In all cultures, the laby­\nrinth has the meaning of an entangling and \nconfusing representation of the world oi matri­\narchal consciousness; it can be traversed only \nby those who are ready for a special initiation \ninto the mysterious world of the collective un­\nconscious.) Having overcome this danger, \nTheseus rescued Ariadne, a maiden in distress. \nThis rescue symbolizes the liberation of the \nanima figure from the devouring aspect of the \nmother image. Not until this is accomplished \ncan a man achieve his first true capacity for \nrelatedness to women. The fact that this man \nhad failed adequately to separate the anima \nfrom the mother was emphasized in another \ndream, in which he encountered a dragon —a \nsymbolic image for the \"devouring\" aspect of \nhis attachment to his mother. This dragon pur­\nsued him, and because he had no weapon .he \nbegan to get the worst of the struggle. \nSignificantly, however, his wife appeared in \nthe dream, and her appearance somehow made \nthe dragon smaller and less threatening. This \nchange in the dream showed that in his mar­\nriage the dreamer was belatedly overcoming \nSome heroic battles and rescues \nfrom Greek myth: Far left, Perseus \nslays Medusa (on a sixth-century \nB.C. vase); left, Perseus with \nAndromeda (from a first-century B.C. \nmural) whom he saved from a monster. \nRight, Theseus kills the Minotaur \n(on a first-century B.C. jar) watched \nby Ariadne; below, on a Cretan coin \n(67 B.C.), the Minotaur's labyrinth.\n\f\nthe attachment to his mother. In other words, \nhe had to find a means of freeing the psychic \nenergy attached to the mother-son relationship, \nin order to achieve a more adult relation to \nwomen — and, indeed, to adult society as a \nwhole. The hero-dragon battle was the symbolic \nexpression of this process of \"growing up.\" \nBut the hero's task has an aim that goes \nbeyond biological and marital adjustment. It is \nto liberate the anima as that inner component \nof the psyche that is necessary for any true \ncreative achievement. In this man's case we \nhave to guess the probability of this outcome \nbecause it is not directly stated in the dream of \nthe Indian journey. But I am sure he would \nconfirm my hypothesis that his journey over the \nhill and the sight of his goal as a peaceful har­\nbor town contained the rich promise that he \nwould discover his authentic anima function. \nHe would thus be cured of his early resentment \nat not being given protection (the rainhat) by \nthe woman for his journey through India. (In \ndreams, significantly placed towns can often be \nanima symbols.) \nThe man had won this promise of security \nfor himself by his contact with the authentic \nhero archetype, and had found a new co-opera­\ntive and related attitude to the group. His sense \nof rejuvenation naturally followed. He had \ndrawn on the inner source of strength that the \nhero archetype represents; he had clarified and \ndeveloped that part of him which was symbol­\nized by the woman; and he had, by his ego's \nheroic act, liberated himself from his mother. \nThese and many other examples of the hero \nmyth in modern dreams show that the ego as \nhero is always essentially a bearer of culture \nrather than a purely egocentric exhibitionist. \nEven Trickster, in his misguided or unpurposive \nway, is a contributor to the cosmos as primitive \nman sees it. In Navaho mythology, as Coyote, \nhe hurled the stars into the sky as an act of \ncreation, he invented the necessary contingency \nof death, and in the myth of emergence he \nhelped lead the people through the hollow reed \nwhereby they escaped from one world to an­\nother above it where they were safe from the \nthreat of flood. \nWe have here a reference to that form of \ncreative evolution which evidently begins on a \nchildlike, preconscious, or animal level of exist­\nence. The ego's rise to effective conscious action \nbecomes plain in the true culture-hero. In the \nsame fashion the childish or adolescent ego frees \nitself from the oppression of parental expecta­\ntions and becomes individual. As part of this \nrise to consciousness the hero-dragon battle may \nhave to be fought and refought to liberate \nenergy for the multitude of human tasks that \ncan form a culture pattern out of chaos.\n\f\nThe hero's rescue of a maiden can \nsymbolize the freeing of the anima \nfrom the \"devouring\" aspect of the \nmother. This aspect is represented, \nfar left, by Balinese dancers wearing \nthe mask of Rangda (left), a malign \nfemale spirit; or by the serpent that \nswallowed and then regurgitated the \nGreek hero Jason (above). \nAs in the dream discussed on p 124, \na common anima symbol is a harbor \ntown Below, a poster by Marc Chagall \npersonifies Nice as a mermaid.\n\f\nWhen this is successful, we see the full hero \nimage emerging as a kind of ego strength for, \nif we are speaking in collective terms, a tribal \nidentity) that has no further need to overcome \nthe monsters and the giants. It has reached the \npoint where these deep forces can be person­\nalized. The \"feminine element\" no longer ap­\npears in dreams as a dragon, but as a woman; \nsimilarly, the \"shadow\" side of the personality \ntakes on a less menacing form. \nThis important point is illustrated in the \ndream of a man nearing 50. All his life he had \nsuffered from periodic attacks of anxiety asso­\nciated with fear of failure (originally engen­\ndered by a doubting mother). Yet his actual \nachievements, both in his profession and in his \npersonal relations, were well above average. In \nhis dream his nine-year-old son appeared as a \nyoung man of about 18 or 19, dressed in the \nshining armor of a medieval knight. The young \nman is called upon to fight a host of men in \nblack, which he prepares at first to do. Then he \nsuddenly removes his helmet, and smiles at the \nleader of the menacing host; it is clear that \nthey will not engage in the battle but will \nbecome friends. \nThe son in the dream is the man's own \nyouthful ego, which had frequently felt threat­\nened by the shadow in the form of self-doubt. \nHe had, in a sense, waged a successful crusade \nagainst this adversary all his mature life. Now, \npartly through the actual encouragement of \nseeing his son grow up without such doubts, but \nmainly by forming a suitable image of the hero \nin the form closest to his own environmental \npattern, he finds it no longer necessary to fight \nthe shadow; he can accept it. That is what is \nsymbolized in the act of friendship. He is no \nlonger driven to a competitive struggle for indi­\nvidual supremacy, but is assimilated to the cul­\ntural task of forming a democratic sort of com­\nmunity. Such a conclusion, reached in the full­\nness of life, goes beyond the heroic task and \nleads one to a truly mature attitude. \nThis change, however, does not take place \nautomatically. It requires a period of transition, \nwhich is expressed in the various forms of the \narchetype of initiation. \ni 28 \nThe archetype of initiation \nIn a psychological sense the hero image is not \nto be regarded as identical with the ego proper. \nIt is better described as the symbolic means by \nwhich the ego separates itself from the arche­\ntypes evoked by the parental images in early \nchildhood. Dr. Jung has suggested that each \nhuman being has originally a feeling of whole­\nness, a powerful and complete sense of the Self. \nAnd from the Self the totality of the psyche — \nthe individualized ego-consciousness emerges \nas the individual grows up. \nWithin the past few years, the works of \ncertain followers of Jung have begun to docu­\nment the series of events by which the indi­\nvidual ego emerges during the transition from \ninfancy through childhood. This separation can \nnever become final without severe injury to Un­\noriginal sense of wholeness. And the ego must \ncontinually return to re-establish its relation to \n128\n\f\nthe Self in order to maintain a condition of \npsychic health. \nIt would appear from my studies that the \nhero myth is the first stage in the differentia­\ntion of the psyche. I have suggested that it \nseems to go through a fourfold cycle by which \nthe ego seeks to achieve its relative autonomy \nfrom the original condition of wholeness. Unless \nsome degree of autonomy is achieved, the indi­\nvidual is unable to relate himself to his adult \nenvironment. But the hero myth does not \nensure that this liberation will occur. It only \nshows how it is possible for it to occur, so that \nthe ego may achieve consciousness. There re­\nmains the problem of maintaining and develop­\ning that consciousness in a meaningful way, so \nthat the individual can live a useful life and \ncan achieve the necessary sense of self-distinc­\ntion in society. \nAncient history and the rituals of contem­\nporary primitive societies have provided us with \na wealth of material about myths and rites of \ninitiation, whereby young men and women are \nweaned away from their parents and forcibly \nmade members of their clan or tribe. But in \nmaking this break with the childhood world, \nthe original parent archetype will be injured, \nand the damage must be made good by a heal­\ning process of assimilation into the life of the \ngroup. (The identity of the group and the indi­\nvidual is often symbolized by a totem animal.) \nThus the group fulfills the claims of the injured \narchetv pe and becomes a kind ol second parent \nto which the young are first symbolically sacri­\nficed, only to re-emerge into a new life. \nIn this \"drastic ceremony, which looks very \nlike a sacrifice to the powers that might hold \nthe young man back,\" as Dr. Jung has put it, \nA primitive tribe's  totem  (often an \nanimal) symbolizes each tribesman's \nidentity with the tribal unit. Left, \nan Australian aborigine imitating \n(in a ritual dance) his tribe's totem \n—an emu. Many modern groups \nuse totem-like animals as emblems: \nBelow, a heraldic lion (from the \nBelgian coat of arms) on a 17th-\ncentury allegorical map of Belgium. \nRight, the falcon is the mascot of \nthe American Air Force Academy's \nfootball team. Far right, modern \ntotemistic emblems that aren't \nanimals: a shop window display \nof ties, badges, etc. of British \nschools and clubs. \nI29\n\f\nwc sec how the power of the original archetype \ncan never be permanently overcome, in the \nmanner envisaged by the hero-dragon battle, \nwithout a crippling sense ol alienation from the \nfruitful powers of the unconscious. We saw in \nthe myth of the Twins how their hybris, ex­\npressing excessive ego-Self separation, was cor­\nrected by their own fear of the consequences, \nwhich forced them back into a harmonious ego-\nSelf relation. \nIn tribal societies it is the initiation rite that \nmost effectively solves this problem. The ritual \ntakes the novice back to the deepesl level ol \noriginal mother-child identity or ego-Self iden­\ntity, thus forcing him to experience a symbolic \ndeath. In other words, his identity is tempo­\nrarily dismembered or dissolved in the collective \nunconscious. From this state he is then cere­\nmonially rescued by the rite ol the new birth. \nThis is the first act of true consolidation ol the \nego with the larger group, expressed as totem, \nclan, or tribe, or all three combined. \nThe ritual, whether it is found in tribal \ngroups or in more complex societies, invariably \ninsists upon this rite of death and rebirth, which \nprovides the novice with a \"rite of passage\" \nfrom one stage of life to the next, whether it is \nfrom early childhood to later childhood or from \nearly to late adolescence and from then to \nmaturity."

    "raw_text": "Initiatory events are not, of course, confined \nto the psychology of youth. Every new phase of \ndevelopment throughout an individual's life is \naccompanied by a repetition of the original \nconflict between the claims of the Sell and the \nclaims ol the ego. In fact, this conflict may be \nexpressed more powerfully at the period of \ntransition from early maturity to middle age \n(between 35 and 40 in our society than at any \nother time in life. And the transition from \nmiddle age to old age creates again the need \nfor affirmation of the difference between the \nego and the total psyche; the hero receives his \nlast call to action in defense of ego-conscious­\nness against the approaching dissolution of life \nin death. \nAt these crucial periods, the archetype of \ninitiation is strongly activated to provide a \nmeaningful transition that offers something \nmore spiritually satisfying than the adolescent \nrites with their strong secular flavor. The arche­\ntypal patterns ol initiation in this religious sense \nknown since ancient times as \"the mysteries\" \nare woven into the texture of all ecclesiastical \nrituals requiring a special manner of worship at \nthe time of birth, marriage, or death. \nAs in our study of the hero myth, so in the \nstudy of initiation we must look for examples \nin the subjective experiences of modern people \nand especially of those who have undergone \nanalysis. It is not surprising that there should \nappear, in the unconscious of someone who is \nseeking help from a doctor specializing in \npsychic disorders, images that duplicate the \nmajor patterns of initiation as we know them \nfrom history. \nPerhaps the commonest ol these themes to be \nfound in young people is the ordeal, or trial of \nstrength. This might seem to be identical with \nwhat we have already noticed in modern \ndreams illustrating the hero myth, such as the \nsailor who had to submit to the weather and to \nbeatings, or that proof of fitness represented in \nthe hike through India of the man without a \nrainhat. We can also sec this theme of physical \nsuffering carried to its logical end in the first \ndream I discussed, when the handsome young \nman became a human sacrifice on an altar. \nThis sacrifice resembled the approach to initia­\ntion, but its end was obscured. It seemed to \nround off the hero cycle, to make way lor a \nnew theme. \nThere is one striking difference between the \nhero myth and the initiation rite. The typical \nhero figures exhaust their efforts in achieving \nthe goal of their ambitions; in short, they \nbecome successful even if immediately after­\nward thev are punished or killed for their \nhybris. In contrast to this, the novice for initia­\ntion is called upon to give up willful ambition \nPrimitive initiation rituals bring \nthe youth into adulthood and into \nthe tribe's collective identity. In \nmany primitive societies, initiation \nis accomplished by circumcision (a \nsymbolic sacrifice). Here are four \nstages in a circumcision rite of \nAustralian aborigines. Far left.top \nand center: The boys are placed \nunder blankets (a symbolic death \nfrom which they will be reborn). \nBottom, they are removed and held \nby the men for the actual operation. \nLeft, the circumcised boys are \ngiven men's conical caps, a mark of \ntheir new status. Right, they are \nfinally isolated from the tribe to \nbe purified and given instruction. \n'31\n\f\nand all desire and to submit to the ordeal. He \nmust be willing to experience this trial without \nhope of success. In fact, he must be prepared \nto die; and though the token of his ordeal may \nbe mild (a period of fasting, the knocking out \nof a tooth, or tattooing) or agonizing (the inflic­\ntion of the wounds of circumcision, subincision, \nor other mutilations), the purpose remains \nalways the same: To create the symbolic mood \nof death from which may spring the symbolic \nmood of rebirth. \nA young man of 25 dreams of climbing a \nmountain on top of which there is a kind of \naltar. Near the altar he sees a sarcophagus with \na statue of himself upon it. Then a veiled priest \napproaches carrying a staff on which there \nglows a living sun-disk. (Discussing the dream \nlater, the young man said that climbing a \nmountain reminded him of the effort he was \nmaking in his analysis to achieve self-mastery.) \nTo his surprise, he finds himself, as it were, \ndead, and instead of a sense of achievement he \nfeels deprivation and fear. Then comes a feeling \nof strength and rejuvenation as he is bathed \nin the warm rays of the sun-disk. \nThis dream shows quite succinctly the dis­\ntinction we must make between initiation and \nthe hero myth. The act of climbing the moun­\ntain seems to suggest a trial of strength: It is \nthe will to achieve ego-consciousness in the \nheroic phase of adolescent development. The \npatient had evidently thought that his approach \nto therapy would be like his approach to other \ntests of manhood, which he had approached in \nthe competitive manner characteristic of young \nmen in our society. But the scene by the altar \ncorrected this mistaken assumption, showing \nhim that his task is rather to submit to a power \ngreater than himself. He must see himself as if \nhe were dead and entombed in a symbolic form \n(the sarcophagus) that recalls the archetypal \nmother as the original container of all life. Only \nby such an act of submission can he experience \nrebirth. An invigorating ritual brings him to life \nagain as the symbolic son of a Sun Father. \nHere again we might confuse this with a hero \ncycle — that of the Twins, the \"children of the \nSun.\" But in this case we have no indication \nthat the initiate will over-reach himself. Instead, \nhe has learned a lesson in humility by experi­\nencing a rite of death and rebirth that marks \nhis passage from youth to maturity. \nAccording to his chronological age he should \nalready have made this transition, but a pro­\nlonged period of arrested development has held \nhim back. This delay had plunged him into a \nneurosis for which he had come for treatment, \nand the dream offers him the same wise counsel \nthat he could have been given by any good \ntribal medicine man — that he should give up \nscaling mountains to prove his strength and \nsubmit to the meaningful ritual of an initiatory \nchange that could fit him for the new moral \nresponsibilities of manhood. \nThe theme of submission as an essential \nattitude toward promotion of the successful \ninitiation rite can be clearly seen in the case of \ngirls or women. Their rite of passage initially \nemphasizes their essential passivity, and this is \nreinforced by the psychological limitation on \ntheirautonomyimposedby the menstrual cycle. \nIt has been suggested that the menstrual cycle \nmay actually be the major part of initiation \nfrom a woman's point of view, since it has the \npower to awaken the deepest sense of obedience \nto life's creative power over her. Thus she will­\ningly gives herself to her womanly function, \nmuch as a man gives himself to his assigned \nrole in the community life of his group. \nOn the other hand, the woman, no less than \nthe man, has her initial trials of strength that \nA sarcophagus from second-century \nA.D.

This sacrifice enables a \nwoman to free herself from the entanglement of \npersonal relations and fits her for a more con­\nscious role as an individual in her own right. \nIn contrast, a man's sacrifice is a surrender of \nhis sacred independence: He becomes more \nconsciously related to woman. \nHere we come to that aspect of initiation \nwhich acquaints man with woman and woman \nwith man in such a way as to correct some sort \nof original male-female opposition. Man's \nknowledge (Logos) then encounters woman's \nrelatedness Eros i and their union is represented \nas that symbolic ritual of a sacred marriage \nwhich has been at the heart of initiation since \nits origins in the mystery-religions of antiquity. \nBut this is exceedingly difficult for modern \npeople to grasp, and it frequently takes a special \ncrisis in their lives to make them understand it. \nSeveral patients have told me dreams in \nwhich the motif of sacrifice is combined with \nthe motif of the sacred marriage. One of these \nwas produced by a young man who had fallen \nin love but was unwilling to marry for fear that \nmarriage would become a kind of prison pre­\nsided over by a powerful mother figure. His \nown mother had been a strong influence in his \nchildhood, and his future mother-in-law pre­\nsented a similar threat.

If it were possible for him to achieve \nthis condition, marriage would then become \nacceptable to him. \nIn the ritual dance each man faced his \nwoman partner, and all four took their places \nat the corners of a square dancing ground. As \nthey danced, it became apparent that this was \nalso a kind of sword dance. Each dancer had \nin his hand a short sword with which to per­\nform a difficult arabesque, moving arms and \nlegs in a series of movements that suggested \nalternate impulses ol aggression and submission \nto each other. In the final scene of the dance \nall four dancers had to plunge- the swords into \ntheir own breasts and die. Only the dreamer \nrefused to accomplish the final suicide, and was \nleft standing alone after the others had fallen. \nHe felt deeply ashamed of his cowardly failure \nto sacrifice himself with the others. \nThis dream brought home to my patient the \nfact that he was more than ready to change \nhis attitude to life. He had been self-centered, \nseeking the illusory safety of personal indepen­\ndence but inwardly dominated by the fears \ncaused by childhood subjection to his mother. \nHe needed a challenge to his manhood in order \nto see that unless he sacrificed his childish state \nof mind he would be left isolated and ashamed. \nThe dream, and his subsequent insight into its \nmeaning, dispelled his doubts. He had passed \nthrough the symbolic rite by which a young \nman gives up his exclusive autonomy and \naccepts his shared life in a related, not just \nheroic, form. \nAnd so he married and found appropriate \nfulfillment in his relationship with his wife. Far \nfrom impairing his effectiveness in the world, \nhis marriage actually enhanced it. \nQuite apart from the neurotic fear that \ninvisible mothers or lathers may be lurking \nbehind the marriage veil, even the normal \nvoting man has good reason to leel apprehen­\nsive about the wedding ritual. It is essentially \na woman's initiation rite, in which a man is \nbound to feel like anything but a conquering \nhero.

    "raw_text": "rape of the bride. These enable the man to \ncling to the remnants of his heroic role at the \nvery moment that he must submit to his bride \nand assume the responsibilities of marriage. \nBut the theme of marriage is an image of \nsuch universality that it also has a deeper mean­\ning. It is an acceptable, even necessary, sym­\nbolic discovery of the feminine component of a \nman's own psyche, just as much as it is the \nacquisition of a real wife. So one may encoun­\nter this archetype in a man of any age in \nresponse to a suitable stimulus. \nNot all women, however, react trustingly to \nthe married state. A woman patient who had \nunfulfilled longings for a career, which she had \nhad to give up for a very difficult and short­\nlived marriage, dreamed that she was kneeling \nopposite a man who was also kneeling. He had \na ring that he prepared to put on her finger, \nbut she stretched out her right-hand ring finger \nin a tense manner—evidently resisting this \nritual of marital union. \nIt was easy to point out her significant error. \nInstead of offering the left-hand ring finger (by \nwhich she could accept a balanced and natural \nrelation to the masculine principle) she had \nwrongly assumed that she had to put her entire \nconscious (i.e. right-sided) identity in the ser­\nvice of the man. In fact, marriage required her \nto share with him only that subliminal, natural \n(i.e. left-sided) part of herself in which the \nprinciple of union would have a symbolic, not \na literal or absolute, meaning. Her fear was the \nfear of the woman who dreads to lose her \nidentity in a strongly patriarchal marriage, \nwhich this woman had good reason to resist. \nNevertheless, the sacred marriage as an \narchetypal form has a particularly important \nmeaning for the psychology of women, and one \nfor which they are prepared during their ado­\nlescence by many preliminary events of an \ninitiatory character. \nThe archetypal sacred marriage (the \nunion of opposites, of the male and \nfemale principles) represented here \nby a 19th-century Indian sculpture \nof the deities Siva and Parvati."

    "raw_text": "Beauty and the Beast \nGirls in our society share in the masculine hero \nmyths because, like boys, they must also de­\nvelop a reliable ego-identity and acquire an \neducation. But there is an older layer of the \nmind that seems to come to the surface in their \nfeelings, with the aim of making them into \nwomen, not into imitation men. When this \nancient content of the psyche begins to make \nits appearance, the modern young woman may \nrepress it because it threatens to cut her off \nfrom the emancipated equality of friendship \nand opportunity to compete with men that \nhave become her modern privileges. \nThis repression may be so successful that for \na time she will maintain an identification with \nthe masculine intellectual goals she learned at \nschool or college. Even when she marries, she \nwill preserve some illusion of freedom, despite \nher ostensible act of submission to the archetype \nof marriage—with its implicit injunction to \nbecome a mother. And so there may occur, as \nwe very frequently see today, that conflict \nwhich in the end forces the woman to redis­\ncover her buried womanhood in a painful (but \nultimately rewarding) manner. \nI saw an example of this in a young married \nwoman who did not yet have any children but \nwho intended to have one or two eventually, \nbecause it would be expected of her. Mean­\nwhile her sexual response was unsatisfactory. \nThis worried her and her husband, though they \nwere unable to offer any explanation for it. \nShe had graduated with honors from a good \nwomen's college and enjoyed a life of intellec­\ntual companionship with her husband and other \nmen. Although this side of her life went well \nenough much of the time, she had occasional \noutbursts of temper and talked in an aggressive \nfashion that alienated men and gave her an in­\ntolerable feeling of dissatisfaction with herself. \nShe had a dream at this time that seemed so \nimportant she sought professional advice to \nunderstand it. She dreamed she was in a line \nof young women like herself, and as she looked \nahead to where they were going she saw that as \neach came to the head of the line she was de­\ncapitated by a guillotine. Without any fear the \ndreamer remained in the line, presumably quite \nwilling to submit to the same treatment when \nher turn came. \nI explained to her that this meant she was \nready to give up the habit of \"living in her \nhead\"; she must learn to free her body to dis­\ncover its natural sexual response and the fulfill­\nment of its biological role in motherhood. The \ndream expressed this as the need to make a \ndrastic change; she had to sacrifice the \"mascu­\nline\" hero role. \nAs one might expect, this educated woman \nhad no difficulty in accepting this interpretation \nat an intellectual level, and she set about trying \nto change herself into a more submissive kind \nof woman. She did then improve her love-life \nand became the mother of two very satisfactory \nchildren. As she grew to know herself better, \nshe began to sec that for a man (or the mascu­\nline-trained mind in women) life is something \nthat has to be taken by storm, as an act of the \nheroic will; but for a woman to feel right about \nherself, life is best realized by a process of \nawakening. \nA universal myth expressing this kind of \nawakening is found in the fairy tale of Beauty \nand the Beast. The best-known version of this \nstory relates how Beauty, the youngest of four \ndaughters, becomes her father'sfavorite because \nof her unselfish goodness. When she asks her \nfather only for a white rose, instead of the more \ncostly presents demanded by the others, she is \naware only of her inner sincerity of feeling. She \ndoes not know that she is about to endanger \nher father's life and her ideal relation with him. \nFor he steals the white rose from the enchanted \ngarden of Beast, who is stirred to anger by the \ntheft and requires him to return in three \nmonths for his punishment, presumably death. \n137\n\f\n(In allowing the lather this reprieve to go \nhome with his gilt. Beast behaves out of char­\nacter, especially when he also oilers to send him \na trunk full of gold when he gets home. As \nBeauty's father comments, the Beast seems cruel \nand kind at the same time.) \nBeauty insists upon taking her father's pun­\nishment and returns after three months to the \nenchanted castle. There she is given a beautiful \nroom where she has no worries and nothing to \nfear except the occasional visits of Beast, who \nrepeatedly comes to ask her if she will someday \nmarry him. She always refuses. Then, seeing in \na magic mirror a picture of her father lying ill. \nshe begs Beast to allow her to return to comfort \nhim, promising to return in a week. Beast tells \nher that he will die if she deserts him. but she \nmay go for a week. \nAt home, her radiant presence brings joy to \nher lather and envy to her sisters, who plot to \ndetain her longer than her promised stay. At \nlength she dreams that Beast is dying of despair. \nSo. realizing she has overstayed her time, she \nreturns to resuscitate him. \nQuite forgetting the dying Beast's ugliness. \nBeauty ministers to him. He tells her that_hc \nwas unable to live without her. and that he will \ndie happy now that she has returned. But \nBeauty realizes that she cannot live without \nBeast, that she has fallen in love with him. She \ntells him so. and promises to be his wile if only \nhe will noi die. \nAt this the castle is Idled with a blaze of light \nand the sound of music, and Beast disappears. \nIn his place stands a handsome prince, who \ntells Beauty that he had been enchanted by a \nwitch and turned into the Beast. The spell was \nordained to last until a beautiful girl should \nlove Beast for his goodness alone. \nIn this story, if we unravel the symbolism, we \nare likely to see that Beauty is any young girl \nor woman who has entered into an emotional \nbond with her lather, no less binding because \nof its spiritual nature. Her goodness is symbol­\nized by her request lor a white rose, but in a \nsignificant twist of meaning her unconscious \nintention puts her lather and then herself in \nthe power of a principle that expresses not \ngoodness alone, but cruelty and kindness com­\nbined. It is as if she wished to be rescued from \na love holding her to an exclusively virtuous \nand unreal attitude. \nBv learning to love Beast she awakens to the \npower of human love concealed in its animal \nand therefore imperfect but genuinely erotic \nform. Presumably this represents an awakening \nof her true function of relatcdncss, enabling her \nto accept the erotic component of her original \nwish, which had to be repressed because ol a \nfear of incest. To leave her father she had. as \nit were, lo accept the inccsl-lear. to allow her­\nself to live in its presence in fantasy until she \ncould get to know the animal man and discover \nher own true response to it as a woman. \nThree scenes from the 1 946 film of \nBeauty and the Beast  (directed by \nFrance's Jean Cocteau): Left, \nBeauty's father caught stealing the \nwhite rose from the Beast's garden; \nright, the Beast dying; far right, \nthe Beast transformed into a Prince, \nwalking with Beauty. The story can \nbe said to symbolize a young girl's \ninitiation — i.e. her release from \nher bond with the father, in order \nto come to terms with the erotic \nanimal side of her nature. Until this \nis done, she cannot achieve a true \nrelationship with a man.\n\f\nIn ihis way she redeems herself and her \nimage ol the masculine from the forces of re­\npression, bringing to consciousness her capacity \nto trust her love as something that combines \nspirit and nature in the best sense of the words. \nA dream <>l an emancipated woman patient \nol mine represented this need to remove the \nincest-fear, a very real fear in this patient's \nthoughts, because ol her father's over-close \nattachment to her following his wife's death. \nI he dream showed her being chased In a furi­\nous bull. She lied at first, but realized it was no \nuse. She fell and the bull was upon her. She \nknew her only hope was to sing to the bull, and \nwhen she did. though in a quavering voice, the \nhull calmed down and began licking her hand \nwith its tongue. The interpretation showed that \nshe could now learn to relate to men in a more \nconfidently feminine way not only sexually, \nhut erotically in the wider sense of relatedness \non the level ol her conscious identity. \nBut in the cases of older women, the Beasi \ntheme may not indicate the need to find the \nanswer to a personal fixation or to release \na sexual inhibition, or any of the things that \nthe psychoanalytically minded rationalist may \nsee in the myth. It can be. in fact, (he expres­\nsion ol a certain kind of woman's initiation, \nwhich may be just as meaningful al the onset \nof the menopause as at the height of adoles­\ncence; and it may appeal at any age. when the \nunion ol spirit and nature has been disturbed. \nA woman of menopausal age reported the \nfollowing dream: \nI am with several anonymous women whom I \ndon't seem to know. We go downstairs in a \nstrange house, and are confronted suddenly by \nsome grotesque \"ape-men'' with evil laces dressed \nin fur with trray and black rings, with tails, hor­\nrible and leering. We arc completely in their \npower, but suddenly I feel the only way we can \nsave ourselves is not to panic and run or fight, \nbut to treat these creatures with humanity as il \nto make them aware of their better side. So one \nol the ape-men comes up to me and I greet him \nlike a dancing partner and begin to dance with \nhim. \nLater. I have been given supernatural healing \npowers and there is a man who is at death's door. \nI have a kind of quill or perhaps a bird's beak \nthrough which I blow air into his nostrils and he \nbegins to breathe again. \nDuring the years of her marriage and the \nraising of her children, this woman bad been \nobliged to neglect her creative gill, with which \nshe had once made a small but genuine reputa­\ntion as a writer. At the lime of her dream she \nbad been trying to force herself back to work \nagain, at the same time criticizing hersell un­\nmercifully lor not being a better wife, friend, \nand mother. The dream showed her problem \nin the light of other women who might be going \nthrough a similar transition, descending, as the \ndream puts il. into the lower regions ol a \nstrange bouse from a too highly conscious level.\n\f\nThis we can guess to be the entrance to some \nmeaningful aspect of the collective unconscious, \nwith its challenge to accept the masculine prin­\nciple as animal-man, that same heroic, clown­\nlike Trickster figure we met at the beginning \nof the primitive hero cycles. \nFor her to relate to this ape-man, and hu­\nmanize him by bringing out what is good in \nhim, meant that she would first have to accept \nsome unpredictable element of her natural \ncreative spirit. With this she could cut across \nthe conventional bonds of her life and learn to \nwrite in a new way, more appropriate for her \nin the second part of life. \nThat this impulse is related to the creative \nmasculine principle is shown in the second scene \nwhere she resuscitates a man by blowing air \nthrough a kind of bird's beak into his nose. \nThis pneumatic procedure suggests the need for \na revival of the spirit rather than the principle \nof erotic warmth. It is a symbolism known all \nover the world: The ritual act brings the \ncreative breath of life to any new achievement. \nThe dream of another woman emphasizes \nthe \"nature\" aspect of Beauty and the Beast: \nSomething flies or is thrown in through the \nwindow, like a large insect with whirling spiral \nlegs, yellow and black. It then becomes a queer \nanimal, striped yellow and black, like a tiger, with \nbear-like, almost human paws and a pointed wolf­\nlike face. It may run loose and harm children. \nIt is Sunday afternoon, and I see a little girl all \ndressed in white on her way to Sunday school. \nI must get the police to help. \nBut then I see the creature has become part \nwoman, part animal. It fawns upon me, wants to \nbe loved. I feel it's a fairy-tale situation, or a \ndream, and only kindness can transform it. I try \nto embrace it warmly, but I can't go through with \nit. I push it away. But I have the feeling I must \nkeep it near and get used to it and maybe some­\nday I'll be able to kiss it. \nHere we have a different situation from the \nprevious one. This woman had been too inten­\nsively carried away by the masculine creative \nfunction within herself, which had become a \ncompulsive, mental (that is, \"air-borne\") pre­\noccupation. Thus she has been prevented from \ndischarging her feminine, wifely function in a \nnatural way. (In association to this dream she \nsaid: \"When my husband comes home, my \ncreative side goes underground and I become \nthe over-organized housewife.\") Her dream \ntakes this unexpected turn of transforming her \nspirit gone bad into the woman she must accept \nand cultivate in herself; in this way she can \nharmonize her creative intellectual interests \nwith the instincts that enable her to relate \nwarmly to others. \nThis involves a new acceptance of the dual \nprinciple of life in nature, of that which is cruel \nbut kind, or, as we might say in her case, ruth­\nlessly adventurous but at the same time humbly \nand creatively domestic. These opposites obvi­\nously cannot be reconciled except on a highly \nsophisticated psychological level of awareness, \nand would of course be harmful to that inno­\ncent child in her Sunday-school dress. \nThe interpretation one could place on this \nwoman's dream is that she needed to overcome \nsome excessively naive image of herself. She had \nto be willing to embrace the full polarity of her \nfeelings — just as Beauty had to give up the \ninnocence of trusting in a father who could not \ngive her the pure white rose of his feeling with­\nout awakening the beneficent fury of the Beast. \nAbove, the Greek god Dionysus \necstatically playing the lute (in a \nvase painting). The frenzied and \norgiastic rites of the Dionysiac \ncults symbolized initiation into \nnature's mysteries. Right, Maenads \nworshiping Dionysus; far right, \nsatyrs in the same wild worship. \n140"

    "raw_text": "Orpheus and the Son of Man \n\"Beauty and the Beast\" is a fairy tale with the \nquality of a wild flower, appearing so unexpect­\nedly and creating in us such a natural sense of \nwonder that we do not notice for the moment \nthat it belongs to a definite class, genus, and \nspecies of plant. The kind of mystery inherent \nin such a story is given a universal application \nnot only in a larger historical myth, but also in \nthe rituals whereby the myth is expressed or \nfrom which it may be derived. \nThe type of ritual and myth appropriately \nexpressing this type of psychological experience \nis exemplified in the Greco-Roman religion of \nDionysus, and in its successor, the religion of \nOrpheus. Both of these religions provided a \nsignificant initiation of the type known as \"mys­\nteries.\" They brought forth symbols associated \nwith a god-man of androgynous character who \nwas supposed to have an intimate understand­\ning of the animal or plant world and to be \nthe master of initiation into their secrets. \nThe Dionysiac religion contained orgiastic \nrites that implied the need for an initiate to \nabandon himself to his animal nature and \nthereby experience the full fertilizing power of \nthe Earth Mother. The initiating agent for this \nrite of passage in the Dionysiac ritual was wine. \nIt was supposed to produce the symbolic lower­\ning of consciousness necessary to introduce the \nnovice into the closely guarded secrets of \nnature, whose essence was expressed by a sym­\nbol of erotic fulfillment: the god Dionysus \njoined with Ariadne, his consort, in a sacred \nmarriage ceremony. \nIn time the rites of Dionysus lost their emo­\ntive religious power. There emerged an almost \noriental longing for liberation from their exclu­\nsive preoccupation with the purely natural sym­\nbols of life and love. The Dionysiac religion, \nshifting constantly from spiritual to physical \nand back again, perhaps proved too wild and \nturbulent for some more ascetic souls. These \ncame to experience their religious ecstasies in­\nwardly, in the worship of Orpheus. \nOrpheus was probably a real man, a singer, \nprophet, and teacher, who was martyred and \nI4I\n\f\nwhose tomb became a shrine. No wonder the \nearly Christian church saw in Orpheus the pro­\ntotype of Christ. Both religions brought to the \nlate Hellenistic world the promise of a future \ndivine life. Because they were men, yet also \nmediators of the divine, for the multitudes of \nthe dying Grecian culture in the days of the \nRoman Empire they held the longed-for hope \nof a future life. \nThere was, however, one important differ­\nence between the religion ol Orpheus and the \nreligion of Christ. Though sublimated into a \nmystical form, the Orphic mysteries kept alive \nthe old Dionysiac religion. The spiritual im­\npetus came from a demi-god, in whom was \npreserved the most significant cpiality of a \nreligion rooted in the art of agriculture. That \ncpiality was the old pattern of the fertility gods \nwho came only for the season in other words, \nthe eternally recurrent cycle of birth, growth, \nfullness, and decay. \nChristianity, on the other hand, dispelled the \nmysteries. Christ was the product and reformer \nof a patriarchal, nomadic, pastoral religion, \nwhose prophets represented their Messiah as a \nbeing of absolutely divine origin. The Son of \nMan. though born of a human virgin, had his \nbeginning in heaven, whence he came in an \nact of God's incarnation in man. Alter his \ndeath, he returned to heaven but returned \nonce and for all. to reign on the right hand ol \nGod until the Second Coming \"when the dead \nshall arise.\" \nOf course the asceticism of early Christianity \ndid not last. The memory of the cyclic mysteries \nhaunted its followers to the extent that the \nChurch eventually had to incorporate many \npractices from the pagan past into its rituals. \nThe most meaningful ol these may be found in \nthe old records of what was done on Holy \nSaturday and Easter Sunday in celebration of \nthe resurrection of Christ the baptismal ser­\nvice that the medieval church made into a suit­\nable and deeply meaningful initiation rite. But \nthat ritual has scarcely survived into modern \ntimes, and it is completely absent in Pro­\ntestantism. \nThe ritual that has survived much better, \nand that still contains the meaning of a central \ninitiation mystery for the devout, is the Catholic \npractice of the elevation of the chalice. It has \nbeen described by Dr. Jung in his \"Transfor­\nmation Symbolism in the Mass\": \n\"The lifting up of the chalice in the air pre­\npares the spiritualization . . . of the wine. This \nis confirmed by the invocation to the Holy \n142\n\f\nGhost that immediately follows. . . . The invo­\ncation serves to infuse the wine with holy spirit, \nlor it is the Holy Ghost who begets, fulfills, and \ntransforms. . . . After the elevation, the chalice \nwas, in former times, set down to the right of \nthe Host, to correspond with the blood that \nflowed from the right side of Christ.\" \nThe ritual of communion is everywhere the \nsame, whether it is expressed by drinking of the \ncup of Dionysus or of the holy Christian cha­\nlice; but the level ol awareness each brings to \n(he individual participant is different. The \nDionysiac participant looks back to the origin \nol things, to the \"storm-birth\" of the god who \nis blasted from the resistant womb of Mother \nEarth. In the frescoes of the Villa de Misteri in \nPompeii, the enacted rite evoked the god as a \nmask of terror reflected in the cup of Dionysus \noffered by the priest to the initiate. Eater we \nfind the winnowing basket, with its precious \nfruits of the earth, and the phallus as creative \nsymbols of the god's manifestation as the prin­\nciple of breeding and growth. \nIn contrast to this backward look, with its \ncentral focus on nature's eternal cycle of birth \nand death, the Christian mystery points for­\nward to the initiate's ultimate hope of union \nwith a transcendent god. Mother Nature, with \nAbove, a Dionysiac ritual depicted \non the great fresco in the Villa \nof the Mysteries at Pompeii. In \nthe center an initiate is offered \nthe ceremonial cup of Dionysus, in \nwhich he sees a reflection of the \ngod-mask held behind. This is a \nsymbolic infusion of the drink with \nthe god's spirit — which can be said \nto parallel the Roman Catholic \nceremony of elevating the chalice \nduring Mass (below) \n143\n\f\nLeft, Orpheus charming the beasts \nwith his song (in a Roman mosaic); \nabove, the murder of Orpheus by \nThracian women (on a Greek vase). \nBelow left, Christ as the Good \nShepherd (a sixth-century mosaic). \nBoth Orpheus and Christ parallel \nthe archetype of the man of nature \n—also reflected in the painting by \nCranach (below) of \"natural man's\" \ninnocence. Facing page, left, the \n18th-century French philosopher \nRousseau, who put forward the idea \nof the \"noble savage\"—the simple \nchild of nature free of sin and evil. \nFar right, the title page of  Walden, \nby the 19th -century American writer \nThoreau, who believed in and followed \na natural way of life almost wholly \nindependent of civilization. \nI44\n\f\nall her beautiful seasonal changes, has been left \nbehind, and the central figure of Christianity \noffers spiritual certainty, for he is the Son of \nGod in heaven. \nYet the two somehow fuse in the figure of \nOrpheus, the god who remembers Dionysus but \nlooks forward to Christ. The psychological \nsense of this intermediate figure has been de­\nscribed by the Swiss author Linda Fierz-David, \nin her interpretation of the Orphic rite pictured \nin the Villa de Misteri: \n\"Orpheus taught while he sang and played \nthe lyre, and his singing was so powerful that \nit mastered all nature; when he sang to his \nlyre the birds flew about him, the fish left the \nwater and sprang to him. The wind and the \nsea became still, the rivers flowed upward to­\nward him. It did not snow and there was no \nhail. Trees and the very stones followed after \nOrpheus; tiger and lion lay down near him \nnext to the sheep, and the wolves next to the \nstag and the roe. Now what does this mean? \nIt surely means that through a divine insight \ninto the meaning of natural events . . . nature's \nhappenings become harmoniously ordered from \nwithin. Everything becomes light and all crea­\ntures appeased when the mediator, in the \nact of worshiping, represents the light of nature. \nOrpheus is an embodiment of devotion and \npiety; he symbolizes the religious attitude that \nsolves all conflicts, since thereby the whole soul \nis turned toward that which lies on the other \nside of all conflict. . . . And as he does this, he \nis truly Orpheus; that is, a good shepherd, his \nprimitive embodiment. . . .\" \nBoth as good shepherd and as mediator. \nOrpheus strikes the balance between the Dio­\nnysiac religion and the Christian religion, since \nwe find both Dionysus and Christ in similar \nroles, though, as I have said, differently orien­\nted as to time and direction in space one a \ncyclic religion of the nether world, the other \nheavenly and eschatological, or final. This series \nof initiatory events, drawn from the context of \nreligious history, is repeated endlessly and with \npractically every conceivable individual twist of \nmeaning in the dreams and fantasies of modern \npeople. \nIn a state of heavy fatigue and depression, a \nwoman undergoing analysis had this fantasy: \nI sit on the side of a long narrow table in a \nhigh vaulted room with no window. My body is \nhunched over and shrunken. There is nothing \nover me but a long white linen cloth that hangs \nfrom my shoulders to the floor. Something crucial \nhas happened to me. There is not much life lelt \nin me. Red crosses on gold disks appear before \nmy eyes. I recall that I have made some sort of \ncommitment a long time ago and wherever I am \nnow must be part of this. I sit there a long time. \nNow I slowly open my eyes and I see a man \nwho sits beside me who is to heal me. He appears \nnatural and kind and he is talking to me though \nI don't hear him. He seems to know all about \nwhere I have been. I am aware that I am very \nugly and that there must be an odor of death \naround me. I wonder if he will be repelled. 1 look \nat him for a very long time. He does not turn \naway. I breathe more easily. \nThen I feel a cool breeze, or cool water, pour \nover my body. I wrap the white linen cloth across \nme now and prepare for a natural sleep. The \nman's healing bands are on my shoulders. I recall \nvaguely that there was a time when there were \nwounds there but the pressure of his hands seems \nto give me strength and healing. \nThis woman had previously felt threatened \nbv doubts about her original religious affilia­\ntion. She had been brought up as a devout \n'45\n\f\nCatholic of the old school, but since her youth \nshe had struggled to free herself from the \nformal religious conventions followed by her \nfamily. Yet the symbolic events of the church \nyear and the richness of her insight into their \nmeaning remained with her throughout the \nprocess of her psychological change; and in her \nanalysis I found this working knowledge of \nreligious symbolism most helpful. \nThe significant elements she singled out of \nher fantasy were the white cloth, which she \nunderstood as a sacrificial cloth; the vaulted \nroom, which she considered to be a tomb; and \nher commitment, which she associated with the \nexperience of submission. This commitment, as \nshe called it, suggested a ritual of initiation with \na perilous descent into the vault of death, which \nsymbolized the way she had left church and \nfamily to experience God in her own fashion. \nShe had undergone an \"imitation of Christ\" in \nthe true symbolic sense, and like him she had \nsuffered the wounds that preceded this death. \nThe sacrificial cloth suggests the winding \nsheet or shroud in which the crucified Christ \nwas wrapped and then placed in the tomb. The \nend of the fantasy introduces the healing figure \nof a man, loosely associated with me as her \nanalyst but appearing also in his natural role \nas a friend fully aware of her experience. He \nspeaks to her in words she cannot yet hear, but \nhis hands are reassuring and give a sense of \nhealing. One senses in this figure the touch and \nthe word of the good shepherd, Orpheus or \nChrist, as mediator and also, of course, as \nhealer. He is on the side of life and has to con­\nvince her that she may now come back from \nthe vault of death. \nShall we call this rebirth or resurrection? \nBoth, perhaps, or neither. The essential rite pro­\nclaims itself at the end: The cool breeze or \nwater flowing over her body is the primordial \nact of purification or cleansing of the sin of \ndeath, the essence of true baptism. \nThe same woman had another fantasy in \nwhich she felt that her birthday fell upon the \nday of Christ's resurrection. (This was much \nmore meaningful for her than the memory of \nher mother, who had never given her the feel-\n146\n\f\ning of reassurance and renewal she so much \nwished for on her childhood birthdays.) But \nthis did not mean she identified herself with \nthe figure of Christ. For all his power and \nglory, something was lacking; and as she tried \nto reach him through prayer, he and his \ncross were lifted up to heaven out of her \nhuman reach. \nIn this second fantasy she fell back upon the \nsymbol of rebirth as a rising sun, and a new \nfeminine symbol began to make its appearance. \nFirst of all it appeared as an \"embryo in a \nwatery sack.\" Then she was carrying an eight-\nyear-old boy through the water \"passing a \ndanger point.\" Then a new movement occurred \nin which she no longer felt threatened or under \nthe influence of death. She was \"in a forest by \na little spring waterfall . . . green vines grow all \naround. In my hands I have a stone bowl in \nwhich there is spring water, some green moss, \nand violets. I bathe myself under the waterfall. \nIt is golden and 'silky' and I feel like a child.\" \nThe sense of these events is clear, though it is \npossible to miss the inner meaning in the cryp­\ntic description of so many changing images. \nHere we have, it seems, a process of rebirth in \nwhich a larger spiritual self is reborn and bap­\ntized in nature as a child. Meanwhile she has \nrescued an older child who was, in some way, \nher own ego at the most traumatic period of \nher childhood. She then carried it through \nwater past the danger point, thus indicating her \nfear of a paralyzing sense of guilt if she should \ndepart too far from her family's conventional \nreligion. But religious symbolism is significant \nby its absence. All is in the hands of nature; we \nare clearly in the realm of the shepherd \nOrpheus rather than the risen Christ. \nA dream followed this sequence, which \nbrought her to a church resembling the church \nin Assisi with Giotto's frescoes of St. Francis. \nShe felt more at home here than she would in \nother churches because St. Francis, like \nOrpheus, was a religious man of nature. This \nrevived her feelings about the change in her \nreligious affiliation that had been so painful to \nundergo, but now she believed she could joy­\nfully face the experience, inspired by the light \nof nature. \nThe series of dreams ended with a distant \necho of the religion of Dionysus. (One could \nsay that this was a reminder that even Orpheus \ncan at times be a little too far removed from \nthe fecundating power of the animal-god in \nman.) She dreamed that she was leading a fair-\nhaired child by the hand. \"We are happily \nparticipating in a festival that includes the sun \nand the forests and flowers all around. The \nchild has a little white flower in her hand, and \nshe places it on the head of a black bull. The \nbull is part of the festival and is covered with \nfestive decorations.\" This reference recalls the \nancient rites that celebrated Dionysus in the \nguise of a bull. \nBut the dream did not end there. The \nwoman added: \"Some time later the bull is \nAbove left, the Persian god Mithras \nsacrificing the bull. The sacrifice \n(also part of Dionysiac rites) can \nbe seen as a symbol of the victory \nof man's spiritual nature over his \nanimality—of which the bull is a \ncommon symbol. (This may explain \nthe popularity in some countries \nof bullfighting, left.) Right, an \netching by Picasso (1 935) depicts \na girl threatened by a Minotaur— \nhere, as in the myth of Theseus, \na symbol of man's uncontrollable \ninstinctive forces.\n\f\npierced by a golden arrow.\" Now, besides \nDionysus, there is another pre-Christian rite in \nwhich the bull plays a symbolic role. The Per­\nsian sun-god Mithras sacrifices a bull. He, like \nOrpheus, represents the longing for a life of \nthe spirit that might triumph over the primitive \nanimal passions of man and, after a ceremony \nof initiation, give him peace. \nThis series of images confirms a suggestion \nthat is found in many fantasy or dream \nsequences of this type that there is no final \npeace, no resting point. In their religious quest \nmen and women — especially those who live in \nmodern Western Christianized societies — are \nstill in the power of those early traditions that \nstrive within them for supremacy, It is a con­\nflict of pagan or Christian beliefs, or, one might \nsay, of rebirth or resurrection. \nA more direct clue to the solution of this \ndilemma is to be found, in this woman's first \nfantasy, in a curious piece of symbolism that \ncould easily be overlooked. The woman says \nthat in her death vault she saw before her eyes \na vision of red crosses on gold disks. As became \nclear later in her analysis, she was about to ex­\nperience a profound psychic change and to \nemerge out of this \"death\" into a new kind of \nlife. We might imagine, therefore, that this \nimage, which came to her in the depth of her \ndespair of life, should in some way herald her \nfuture religiousattitude. In her subsequent work \nshe did in fact produce evidence for thinking \nthat the red crosses represented her devotion to \nthe Christian attitude, while the gold disks re­\npresented her devotion to the pre-Christian \nmystery religions. Her vision had told her that \nshe must reconcile these Christian and pagan \nelements in the new life that lay ahead. \nOne last, but important, observation con­\ncerns the ancient initiation rites and their rela­\ntion to Christianity. The initiation rite cele­\nbrated in the Eleusinian mysteries (the rites of \nworship of the fertility goddesses Demeter and \nPersephone] was not considered appropriate \nmerely for those who sought to live life more \nabundantly; it was also used as a preparation \nfor death, as if death also required an initia­\ntory rite of passage of the same kind. \nOn a funeral urn found in a Roman grave \nnear the Columbarium on the Esquiline Hill we \nfind a clear bas-relief representing scenes of the \nfinal stage of initiation where the novice is \nadmitted to the presence and converse of the \ngoddesses. The rest of the design is devoted to \ntwo preliminary ceremonies of purification— the \nsacrifice of the \"mystic pig,\" and a mysticized \nversion of the sacred marriage. This all points \nto an initiation into death, but in a form that \nlacks the finality of mourning. It hints at that \nelement of the later mysteries — especially of \nOrphism which makes death carry a promise \nof immortality. Christianity went even further. \nIt promised something more than immortality \n(which in the old sense of the cyclic mysteries \nmight merely mean reincarnation), for itoffered \nthe faithful an everlasting life in heaven. \nSo we see again, in modern life, the tendency \nto repeat old patterns. Those who have to learn \nto face death may have to relearn the old mes­\nsage that tells us that death is a mystery for \nwhich we must prepare ourselves in the same \nspirit of submission and humility as we once \nlearned to prepare ourselves for life. \ni4«\n\f\nSymbols of transcendence \nThe symbols that influence man vary in their \npurpose. Some men need to be aroused, and \nexperience their initiation in the violence of a \nDionysiac \"thunder rite.\" Others need to be \nsubdued, and they are brought to submission in \nthe ordered design of temple precinct or sacred \ncave, suggestive of the Apollonian religion of \nlater Greece. A full initiation embraces both \nthemes, as we can see when we look either at \nthe material drawn from ancient texts or at \nliving subjects. But it is quite certain that the \nfundamental goal of initiation lies in taming the \noriginal Trickster-like wildness of the juvenile \nnature. It therefore has a civilizing or spiritu­\nalizing purpose, in spite of the violence of the \nrites that are required to set this process in \nmotion. \nThere is, however, another kind of symbolism, \nbelonging to the earliest known sacred tradi­\ntions, that is also connected with the periods of \ntransition in a persons life. But these symbols \ndo not seek to integrate the initiate with any \nreligious doctrine or secular group-conscious­\nness. On the contrary, they point to man's need \nfor liberation from any state of being that is \ntoo immature, too fixed or final. In other words, \nthey concern man's release from or transcend­\nence of—any confining pattern of existence, as \nhe moves toward a superior or more mature \nstage in his development. \nA child, as I have said, possesses a sense of \ncompleteness, but only before the initial emer­\ngence of his ego-consciousness. In the case of an \nadult, a sense of completeness is achieved \nthrough a union of\" the consciousness with the \nunconscious contents of the mind. Out of this \nunion arises what Jung called \"the transcend­\nent function of the psyche,\" by which a man \ncan achieve his highest goal: the full realization \nof the potential of his individual Self. \nBoth a bird and a shaman (i.e. a \nprimitive medicine man) are \ncommon symbols of transcendence, \nand often are combined: Left, a \nprehistoric cave painting at Lascaux \nshows a shaman in a bird mask. Below, \na shaman priestess of a Siberian \npeople, in a bird costume. Right, \na shaman's coffin (also Siberian) \nwith bird figures on the posts \n149\n\f\n\n\f\nThus, what we call \"symbols of transcend­\nence\" are the symbols that represent man's \nstriving to attain this goal. They provide the \nmeans by which the contents of the unconscious \ncan enter the conscious mind, and they also \nare themselves an active expression of those \ncontents. \nThese symbols are manifold inform. Whether \nwe encounter them in history or in the dreams \nof contemporary men and women who are at a \ncritical stage in their lives, we can see their \nimportance. At the most archaic level of this \nsymbolism we again meet the Trickster theme. \nBut this time he no longer appears as a lawless \nwould-be hero. He has become the shaman \nthe medicine man —whose magical practices \nand flights of intuition stamp him as a primitive \nmaster of initiation. His power resides in his \nsupposed ability to leave his body and fly about \nthe universe as a bird. \nIn this case the bird is the most fitting symbol \nof transcendence. It represents the pecu­\nliar nature of intuition working through a \n\"medium,\" that is, an individual who is capable \nof obtaining knowledge of distant events —or \nfacts of which he consciously knows nothing— \nby going into a trancelike state. \nEvidence of such powers can be found as far \nback as the paleolithic period of prehistory, as \nthe American scholar Joseph Campbell has \npointed out in commenting upon one of the \nfamous cave paintings recently discovered in \nFrance. At Lascaux, he writes, \"there is a sha­\nman depicted, lying in a trance, wearing a bird \nmask with a figure of a bird perched on a staff \nbeside him. The shamans of Siberia wear such \nbird costumes to this day, and many are be­\nlieved to have been conceived by their mothers \nfrom the descent of a bird .... The shaman, \nthen, is not only a familiar denizen, but even \nthe favored scion of those realms of power that \nare invisible to our normal waking conscious­\nness, which all may visit briefly in vision, but \nthrough which he roams, a master.\" \nAt the highest level of this type of initiatory \nactivity, far from those tricks-of-the-trade by \nwhich magic so frequently replaces true spiritual \ninsight, we find the Hindu master yogis. In \ntheir trance states they go far beyond the nor­\nmal categories of thought. \nOne of the commonest dream symbols for \nthis type of release through transcendence is the \ntheme of the lonely journey or pilgrimage, \nwhich somehow seems to be a spiritual pilgrim-\nln myths or dreams, a lonely tourney \noften symbolizes the liberation of \ntranscendence. Above left, a 1 5th-century \npainting of the poet Dante \nholding his book (the  Divine Comedy) \nwhich relates his dream of a journey \nto hell (lower left of picture), \npurgatory, and heaven. Far left, an \nengraving of the lourney made by the \npilgrim in the British author John \nBunyan's  Pilgrim's Progress  (1 678). \n(Note that the journey isa circular \nmovement toward an inner center.) \nThis book, too, is told as a dream; \nleft, the pilgrim dreaming. \nMany people want some change \nfrom a containing pattern of life; \nbut the freedom gained by travel \n(urged by the \"run away to sea\" \nposter, right) is no substitute \nfor a true inner liberation. \n'51\n\f\nage on which the initiate becomes acquainted \nwith the nature of death. But this is not death \nas a last judgment or other initiatory trial of \nstrength; it is a journey of release, renuncia­\ntion, and atonement, presided over and fostered \nby some spirit of compassion. This spirit is more \noften represented by a \"mistress\" rather than a \n\"master\" of initiation, a supreme feminine \n(i.e. anima) figure such as Kwan-Yin in Chin­\nese Buddhism, Sophia in the Christian-Gnostic \ndoctrine, or the ancient Greek goddess of \nwisdom Pallas Athena. \nNot only the flight of birds or the journey \ninto the wilderness represents this symbolism, \nbut any strong movement exemplifying release. \nI n the first part of life, when one is still attached \nto the original family and social group, this \nmay be experienced as that moment of initia­\ntion at which one must learn to take the decisive \nsteps into life alone. It is the moment that \nT. S. Eliot describes in \"The Waste Land,\" \nwhen one faces \nThe awful daring of a moment's surrender, \nwhich an age of prudence can never retract. \nAt a.later period oflife one may not need to \nbreak all ties with the symbols of meaningful \ncontainment. But nonetheless one can be filled \nwith that spirit of divine discontent which forces \nall free men to face some new discovery or to \nlive their lives in a new way. This change may \nbecome especially important in the period be­\ntween middle age and old age, which is the \ntime in life when so many people are consider­\ning what to do in their retirement whether to \nwork or to play, whether to stay at home or to \ntravel. \nIf their lives have been adventurous, insecure, \nor full of change, they may long for a settled \nlife and the consolations of religious certainty. \nBut if they have lived chiefly within the social \npattern in which they were born, they may \ndesperately need a liberating change. This need \nmay be filled, temporarily, by a trip around the \nworld, or by nothing more than a move to a \nsmaller house. But none of these external \nchanges will serve unless there has been some \ninner transcendence of old values in creating, \nnot just inventing, a new pattern oflife. \nA case of this latter sort is a woman who \nhad lived in a style oflife that she, her family, \nand friends had long enjoyed because it was so \nwell rooted, culturally nourishing, and secure \nfrom transitory fashions. She had this dream: \nI found some strange pieces of wood, not \ncarved but with natural beautiful shapes. Some-\nLeft, the British explorer R. F. Scott \nand his companions, photographed in \nthe Antarctic in 1911. Explorers, \nventuring into the unknown, provide \nan apt image of the liberation, the \nbreaking out of containment, that \ncharacterizes transcendence. \nThe symbol of the snake is commonly \nlinked with transcendence, because \nit was traditionally a creature of \nthe underworld — and thus was a \n\"mediator\" between one way of life \nand another. Right, the snake and \nstaff symbol of the Greco-Roman \ngod of medicine Asklepios on a card \nused to identify a doctor's car in \nmodern France. \n>52\n\f\none said: '\"Neanderthal man brought them.\" \nThen I saw at a distance these Neanderthal men \nlooking like a dark mass, but I could not see one \nof them distinctly. I thought I would take back \nfrom this place a piece of their wood. \nThen I went on, as if on a journey by myself, \nand I looked down into an enormous abyss like \nan extinct volcano. There was water in part of it \nand there I expected to see more Neanderthal \nmen. But instead I saw black water pigs that had \ncome out of the water and were running in and \nout of the black volcanic rocks. \nIn contrast to this woman's family attach­\nments and her highly cultivated style of life, \nthe dream takes her to a prehistoric period \nmore primitive than anything we can visualize. \nShe can find no social group among these \nancient men: She sees them as an embodiment \nof a truly unconscious, collective \"dark mass\" \nin the distance. Yet they are alive, and she may \ncarry away a piece of their wood. The dream \nemphasizes that the wood is natural, not carved; \ntherefore it comes from a primordial, not a cul­\nturally conditioned, level of the unconscious. \nThe piece of wood, remarkable for its great age, \nlinks this woman's contemporary experience to \nthe distant origins of human life. \nWe know from many examples that an \nancient tree or plant represents symbolically the \ngrowth and development of psychic life (as \ndistinct from instinctual life, commonly symbo­\nlized by animals). Hence, in this piece of wood, \nthis woman acquired a symbol of her link with \nthe deepest layers of the collective unconscious. \nNext she speaks of continuing her journey \nalone. This theme, as I have already pointed \nout, symbolizes the need for release as an initia­\ntory experience. So here we have another sym­\nbol of transcendence. \nThen, in the dream, she sees a huge crater of \nan extinct volcano, which has been the channel \nfor a violent eruption of fire from the deepest \nlayers of the earth. We can surmise that this \nrefers to a significant memory trace, which leads \nback to a traumatic experience. This she asso­\nciated to a personal experience early in her life \nwhen she had felt the destructive, yet creative, \nforce of her passions to such an extent that she \nfeared she would go out of her mind. She had \nfound, in late adolescence, a quite unexpected \nneed to break away from her family's exces­\nsively conventional social pattern. She had \nachieved this break without serious distress, and \nhad been able to return eventually to make her \npeace with the family. But there lingered a \nprofound wish to make a still greater differen­\ntiation from her family background and to find \nfreedom from her own pattern of existence. \nThis dream recalls another. It came from a \nyoung man who had a totally different problem \nbut who seemed to need a similar type of in­\nsight. He too had the urge to achieve differen­\ntiation. He dreamed of a volcano, and from its \ncrater he saw two birds taking flight as if in \nfear that the volcano was about to erupt. This \nwas in a strange, lonely place with a body of \nwater between him and the volcano. In this \ncase, the dream represented an individual \ninitiation journey. . \nIt is similar to cases reported among the \nsimple food-gathering tribes, which are the least \nfamily-conscious groups we know. In these \nsocieties the young initiate must take a lonely \njourney to a sacred place (in Indian cultures of \nthe North Pacific coast, it may actually be a \ncrater lake) where, in a visionary or trancelike \nstate, he encounters his \"guardian spirit\" in the \n'53\n\f\nform of an animal, a bird, or natural object. \nHe closely identifies himself with this \"bush \nsouT'and thereby becomesa man. Withoutsuch \nan experience he is regarded, as an Achumaui \nmedicine man put it, as \"an ordinary Indian, \nnobody.\" \nThe young man's dream came at the begin­\nning of his life, and it pointed to his future \nindependence and identity as a man. The \nwoman I have described was approaching the \nend of her life, and she experienced a similar \njourney and seemed to need to acquire a simi­\nlar independence. She could live out the re­\nmainder of her days in harmony with an eternal \nhuman law that, by its antiquity, transcended \nthe known symbols of culture. \nBut such independence does not end in a \nstate of yogi-like detachment that would mean \na renunciation of the world with all its impuri­\nties. In the otherwise dead and blasted land­\nscape of her dream the woman saw signs of \nanimal life. These are \"water pigs,\" unknown \nto her as a species. They therefore would carry \nthe meaning of a special type of animal, one \nthat can live in two environments, in water or \non the earth. \nThis is the universal quality of the animal as \na symbol of transcendence. These creatures, \nfiguratively coming from the depths of the \nancient Earth Mother, are symbolic denizens of \nthe collective unconscious. They bring into the \nfield of consciousness a special chthonic (under­\nworld) message that is somewhat different from \nthe spiritual aspirations symbolized by the birds \nin the young man's dream. \nOther transcendent symbols of the depths are \nrodents, lizards, snakes, and sometimes fish. \nThese are intermediate creatures that combine \nunderwater activity and the bird-flight with an \nintermediate terrestrial life. The wild duck or \nthe swan are cases in point. Perhaps the com­\nmonest dream symbol of transcendence is the \nsnake, as represented by the therapeutic symbol \nof the Roman god of medicine Aesculapius, \nwhich has survived to modern times as a sign \nof the medical profession. This was originally \na nonpoisonous tree snake; as we sec it, coiled \naround the staff of the healing god, it seems to \nembody a kind of mediation between earth and \nheaven. \nA still more important and widespread sym­\nbol of chthonic transcendence is the motif of \nthe two entwined serpents. These are the famous \nNaga serpents of ancient India; and we also \nfind them in Greece as the entwined serpents \non the end of the staff belonging to the god \nHermes. An early Grecian herm is a stone \npillar with a bust of the god above. On one side \nare the entwined serpents and on the other an \nerect phallus. As the serpents are represented \n154"

Hermes is Trickster \nin a different role as a messenger, a god of the \ncross-roads, and finally the leader of souls to \nand from the underworld. His phallus therefore \npenetrates from the known into the unknown \nworld, seeking a spiritual message of deliverance \nand healing. \nOriginally in Egypt Hermes was known as \nthe ibis-headed god Thoth, and therefore was \nconceived as the bird form of the transcendent \nprinciple. Again, in the Olympian period of \nGreek mythology, Hermes recovered attributes \nof the bird life to add to his chthonic nature as \nserpent. His staff acquired wings above the ser­\npents, becoming the caduceus or winged staff \nof Mercury, and the god himself became the \n\"flying man\" with his winged hat and sandals. \nHere we see his full power of transcendence, \nwhereby the lower transcendence from under­\nworld snake-consciousness, passing through the \nmedium of earthly reality, finally attains trans­\ncendence to superhuman or transpersonal \nreality in its winged flight. \nSuch a composite symbol is found in other \nrepresentations as the winged horse or winged \ndragon or other creatures that abound in the \nartistic expressions of alchemy, so fully illus­\ntrated in Dr. Jung's classic work on this subject. \nWe follow the innumerable vicissitudes of these \nsymbols in our work with patients. They show \nwhat our therapy can expect to achieve when \nit liberates the deeper psychic contents so that \nthey can become part of our conscious equip­\nment for understanding life more effectively. \nIt is not easy for modern man to grasp the \nsignificance of the symbols that come down to \nus from the past or that appear in our dreams. \nNor is it easy to see how the ancient conflict \nbetween symbols ofcontainment and liberation \nWinged dragons (above, from a 15th-\ncentury manuscript) combine the \ntranscendent symbolism of the snake \nand the bird. Right, an image of \nspiritual transcendence: Mohammed \non the winged mare Buraq flies \nthrough the celestial spheres \n156\n\f\nrelates to our own predicament. Yet it becomes \neasier when we realize it is only the specific-\nforms of these archaic patterns that change, \nnot their psychic meaning. \nWe have been talking of wild birds as sym­\nbols of release or liberation. But today we could \nas well speak of jet planes and space rockets, \nfor they are the physical embodiment of the \nsame transcendent principle, freeing us at least \ntemporarily from gravity. In the same way the \nancient symbols of containment, which once \ngave stability and protection, now appear in \nmodern man's search for economic security \nand social welfare. \nAny of us can see, of course, that there is a \nconflict in our lives between adventure and dis­\ncipline, or evil and virtue, or freedom and \nsecurity. But these are only phrases we use to \ndescribe an ambivalence that troubles us, and \nto which we never seem able to find an answer. \nThere is an answer. There is a meeting point \nbetween containment and liberation, and we \ncan find it in the rites of initiation that I have \nbeen discussing. They can make it possible for \nindividuals, or whole groups of people, to unite \nthe opposing forces within themselves and \nachieve an equilibrium in their lives. \nBut the rites do not offer this opportunity \ninvariably, or automatically. They relate to \nparticular phases in the life of an individual, or \nof a group, and unless they are properly under­\nstood and translated into a new way oflife, the \nmoment can pass. Initiation is, essentially, a \nprocess that begins with a rite of submission, \nfollowed by a period of containment, and then \nby a further rite of liberation. In this way every \nindividual can reconcile the conflicting elements \nof his personality: He can strike a balance that \nmakes him truly human, and truly the master \nof himself. \nIn the dreams and fantasies of many \nmodern people, the flights of the \ngreat rockets of space research \nhave often appeared as symbolic \n20th-century embodiments of the \nurge toward liberation and release \nthat is called transcendence. \n'57\n\f\nThe process of individuation \nM.-L. von Franz \nThe rose window of the cathedral of Notre Dame, Paris \n3"

    "raw_text": "The pattern of psychic growth \nAt the beginning of this book Dr. C. G. Jung \nintroduced the reader to the concept of the un­\nconscious, its personal and collective structures, \nand its symbolic mode of expression. Once one \nhas seen the vital importance (that is, the heal­\ning or destructive impact) of the symbols pro­\nduced by the unconscious, there remains the \ndifficult problem of interpretation. Dr. Jung has \nshown that everything depends on whether any \nparticular interpretation \"clicks\" and is mean­\ningful to the individual concerned. In this way \nhe has indicated the possible meaning and func­\ntion of dream symbolism. \nBut, in the development of Jung's theory, \nthis possibility raised another question: What \nis the purpose of the total dream life of the in­\ndividual? What role do dreams play, not only \nin the immediate psychic economy of the hu­\nman being, but in his life as a whole? \nBy observing a great many people and study­\ning their dreams (he estimated that he inter­\npreted at least 80,000 dreams), Jung discovered \nnot only that all dreams are relevant in varying \ndegrees to the life of the dreamer, but that they \nare all parts of one great web of psychological \nfactors, fcle also found that, on the whole, they \nseem to follow an arrangement or pattern. This \npattern Jung called \"the process of individua­\ntion.\" Since dreams produce different scenes \nand images every night, people who are not \ncareful observers will probably be unaware of \nany pattern. But if one watches one's own \ndreams over a period of years and studies the \nentire sequence, one will see that certain con­\ntents emerge, disappear, and then turn up \nagain. Many people even dream repeatedly of \nthe same figures, landscapes, or situations; and \nif one follows these through a whole series, one \nwill see that they change slowly but perceptibly. \nThese changes can be accelerated if the dream­\ner's conscious attitude is influenced by appro­\npriate interpretation of the dreams and their \nsymbolic contents. \nBelow, a \"meander\" (a decoration \nin a seventh-century manuscript). \nIndividual dreams seem as strange \nand fragmented as the detail, above, \nfrom the decoration; but over a \nlifetime's dreaming, a meandering \npattern appears -revealing the \nprocess of psychic growth \ni bo \nThe process of individuation\n\f\nThus our dream life creates a meandering \npattern in which individual strands or tenden­\ncies become visible, then vanish, then return \nagain. If one watches this meandering design \nover a long period of time, one can observe a \nsort of hidden regulating or directing tendency \nat work, creating a slow, imperceptible process \nof psychic growth the process of individuation. \nGradually a wider and more mature person­\nality emerges, and by degrees becomes effective \nand even visible to others. The fact that we \noften speak of \"arrested development\" shows \nthat we assume that such a process of growth \nand maturation is possible with every indivi­\ndual. Since this psychic growth cannot be \nbrought about by a conscious effort of will \npower, but happens involuntarily and natur­\nally, it is in dreams frequently symbolized by \nthe tree, whose slow, powerful, involuntary-\ngrowth fulfills a definite pattern. \nThe organizing center from which the regu­\nlatory effect stems seems to be a sort of \"nu­\nclear atom\" in our psychic system. One could \nalso call it the inventor, organizer, and source \nof dream images. Jung called this center the \n\"Self\" and described it as the totality of the \nwhole psyche, in order to distinguish it from \nthe \"ego,\" which constitutes only a small part of \nthe total psyche. \nThroughout the ages men have been intui­\ntively aware of the existence of such an inner \ncenter. The Greeks called it man's inner dai-\nmon; in Egypt it was expressed by the concept \nof the Ba-soul; and the Romans worshiped it \nas the \"genius\" native to each individual. In \nmore primitive societies it was often thought of \nas a protective spirit embodied within an \nanimal or a fetish. \nThis inner center is realized in exceptionally \npure, unspoiled form by the Naskapi Indians, \nwho still exist in the forests of the Labrador \npeninsula. These simple people are hunters who \nlive in isolated family groups, so far from one \nThe psyche can be compared to a \nsphere with a bright field (A) on its \nsurface, representing consciousness \nThe  ego  is the field's center (only if \n\"I\" know a thing is it conscious) \nThe  Self  is at once the nucleus \nand the whole sphere (B); its internal \nregulating processes produce dreams \nanother that they have not been able to evolve \ntribal customs or collective religious beliefs and \nceremonies. In his lifelong solitude the Naskapi \nhunter has to rely on his own inner voices and \nunconscious revelations; he has no religious \nteachers who tell him what he should believe, \nno rituals, festivals, or customs to help him \nalong. In his basic view oflife, the soul of man \nis simply an \"inner companion,\" whom he calls \n\"my friend\" or Mista'peo, meaning \"Great \nMan.\" Mista'peo dwells in the heart and is im­\nmortal; in the moment of death, or shortly \nbefore, he leaves the individual, and later re­\nincarnates himself in another being. \nThose Naskapi who pay attention to their \ndreams and who try to find their meaning and \ntest their truth can enter into a deeper connec­\ntion with the Great Man. He favors such \npeople and sends them more and better dreams. \nThus the major obligation of an individual \nNaskapi is to follow the instructions given by \nhis dreams, and then to give permanent form \nto their contents in art. Lies and dishonesty \ndrive the (beat Man away from one's inner \nrealm, whereas generosity and love of one's neighbors and of animals attract him and give \nib i \nThe psyche can he compared to a \nsphere with a bright field (A) on its \nsurface, representing consciousness \nThe  ego  is the field's center (only if \n\"I\" know a thing is it conscious) \nThe  Self  is at once the nucleus \nand the whole sphere (B); its internal \nregulating processes produce dreams\n\f\nhim life. Dreams give the Naskapi complete \nability to find his way in life, not only in the \ninner world but also in the outer world of na­\nture. They help him to foretell the weather and \ngive him invaluable guidance in his hunting, \nupon which his life depends. I mention these \nvery primitive people because they are uncon-\ntaminated by our civilized ideas and still have \nnatural insight into the essence of what Jung \ncalls the Self. \nThe Self can be defined as an inner guiding \nfactor that is different from the conscious per­\nsonality and that can be grasped only through \nthe investigation of one's own dreams. These \nshow it to be the regulating center that brings \nabout a constant extension and maturing of the \npersonality. But this larger, more nearly total \naspect of the psyche appears first as merely an \ninborn possibility. It may emerge very slightly, \nor it may develop relatively completely during \none's lifetime. How far it develops depends on \nwhether or not the ego is willing to listen to \nthe messages of the Self. Just as the Naskapi \nhave noticed that a person who is receptive to \nthe hints of the Great Man gets better and more \nhelpful dreams, we could add that the inborn \nGreat Man becomes more real within the \nreceptive person than in those who neglect him. \nSuch a person also becomes a more complete \nhuman being. \nIt even seems as if the ego has not been pro­\nduced by nature to follow its own arbitrary \nimpulses to an unlimited extent, but to help to \nmake real the totality — the whole psyche. It is \nthe ego that serves to light up the entire system, \nallowing it to become conscious and thus to be \nrealized. If, for example, I have an artistic \ntalent of which my ego is not conscious, nothing \nwill happen to it. The gift may as well be non­\nexistent. Only if my ego notices it can T bring \nit into reality. The inborn but hidden totality \nof the psyche is not the same thing as a whole­\nness that is fully realized and lived. \nOne could picture this in the following way: \nThe seed of a mountain pine contains the \nwhole future tree in a latent form; but each \nseed falls at a certain time onto a particular \nplace, in which there are a number of special \nfactors, such as the quality of the soil and the \nstones, the slope of the land, and its exposure \nto sun and wind. The latent totality of the pine \nin the seed reacts to these circumstances by \navoiding the stones and inclining toward the \nsun, with the result that the tree's growth is \nshaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes \ninto existence, constituting the fulfillment of its \ntotality, its emergence into the realm of reality. \nWithout the living tree, the image of the pine is \nonly a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the \nrealization of this uniqueness in the individual \nman is the goal of the process of individuation. \nFrom one point of view this process takes \nplace in man (as well as in every other living \nbeing) by itself and in the unconscious; it is a \nprocess by which man lives out his innate hu­\nman nature. Strictly speaking, however, the \nprocess of individuation is real only if the indi­\nvidual is aware of it and consequently makes a \nliving connection with it. We do not know \nwhether the pine tree is aware of its own \ngrowth, whether it enjoys and suffers the dif­\nferent vicissitudes that shape it. But man cer­\ntainly is able to participate consciously in his \ndevelopment. He even feels that from time to \ntime, by making free decisions, he can co­\noperate actively with it. This co-operation \nbelongs to the process of individuation in the \nnarrower sense of the word. \nMan, however, experiences something that \nis not contained in our metaphor of the pine \ntree. The individuation process is more than a \ncoming to terms between the inborn germ of \nwholeness and the outer acts of fate. Its subjec­\ntive experience conveys the feeling that some \nsupra-personal force is actively interfering in a \ncreative way. One sometimes feels that the un­\nconscious is leading the way in accordance with \na secret design. It is as if something is looking \nat me, something that I do not see but that sees \nme — perhaps that Great Man in the heart, who \ntells me his opinions about me by means of \ndreams. \nBut this creatively active aspect of the psy­\nchic nucleus can come into play only when the \nego gets rid of all purposive and wishful aims \nand tries to get to a deeper, more basic form \n162\n\f\nof existence. The ego must be able to listen \nattentively and to give itself, without any fur­\nther design or purpose, to that inner urge to­\nward growth. Many existentialist philosophers \ntry to describe this state, but they go only as \nfar as stripping off the illusions of conscious­\nness: They go right up to the door of the un­\nconscious and then fail to open it. \nPeople living in cultures more securely rooted \nthan our own have less trouble in understand­\ning that it is necessary to give up the utilitarian \nattitude of conscious planning in order to make \nway for the inner growth of the personality. I \nonce met an elderly lady who had not achieved \nmuch in her life, in terms of outward achieve­\nment. But she had in fact made a good mar­\nriage with a difficult husband, and had some­\nhow developed into a mature personality. When \nshe complained to me that she had not \"done\" \nanything in her life, I told her a story related \nby a Chinese sage, Chuang-Tzu. She under­\nstood immediately and felt great relief. This is \nthe story: \nA wandering carpenter, called Stone, saw on his \ntravels a gigantic old oak tree standing in a field \nnear an earth-altar. The carpenter said to his \napprentice, who was admiring the oak: \"This is \na useless tree. II you wanted to make a ship, it \nwould soon rot; if you wanted to make tools, they \nwould break. You can't do anything useful with \nthis tree, and that's why it has become so old.\" \nBut in an inn, that same evening, when the car­\npenter went to sleep, the old oak tree appeared \nto him in his dream and said: \"Why do you com­\npare me to your cultivated trees such as white­\nthorn, pear, orange, and apple trees, and all the \nothers that bear fruit? Even before they can ripen \ntheir fruit, people attack and violate them. Their \nbranches are broken, their twigs are torn. Their \nown gifts bring harm to them, and they cannot \nlive out their natural span. That is what happens \neverywhere, and that is why I have long since \ntried to become completely useless. You poor mor­\ntal! Imagine if I had been useful in any way, \nwould I have reached this size? Furthermore, \nyou and I are both creatures, and how can one \ncreature set himself so high as to judge another \ncreature? You useless mortal man, what do you \nknow about useless trees?\" \nThe carpenter woke up and meditated upon his \ndream, and later, when his apprentice asked him \nwhy just this one tree served to protect the earth-\naltar, he answered, \"Keep your mouth shut! Let's \nhear no more about it! The tree grew here on \npurpose because anywhere else people would have \nill-treated it. If it were not the tree of the earth-\naltar, it might have been chopped down.\" \nThe carpenter obviously understood his \ndream. He saw that simply to fulfill one's des­\ntiny is the greatest human achievement, and \nthat our utilitarian notions have to give way in \nthe face of the demands of our unconscious \npsyche; If we translate this metaphor into psy­\nchological language, the tree symbolizes the \nprocess of individuation, giving a lesson to our \nshortsighted ego. \nUnder the tree that fulfilled its destiny, there \nwas—in Chuang-Tzu's story —an earth-altar. \nThis was a crude, unwrought stone upon which \npeople made sacrifices to the local god who \n\"owned\" this piece of land. The symbol of the \nearth-altar points to the fact that in order to \nbring the individuation process into reality, one \nmust surrender consciously to the power of the \nunconscious, instead of thinking in terms of \nwhat one should do, or of what is generally \nthought right, or of what usually happens. One \nmust simply listen, in order to learn what the \n163 \nAn earth altar beneath a tree (In \na 19th-century Chinese painting) \nSuch round or square structures \nusually symbolize the Self, to which \nthe ego must submit to fulfill the \nprocess of individuation.\n\f\ninner totality the Self wants one to do here \nand now in a particular situation. \nOur attitude must be like that of the moun­\ntain pine mentioned above: It does not get \nannoyed when its growth is obstructed by a \nstone, nor does it make plans about how to \novercome the obstacles. It merely tries to feel \nwhether it should grow more toward the left or \nthe right, toward the slope or away from it. \nLike the tree, we should give in to this almost \nimperceptible, yet powerfully dominating, im­\npulse an impulse that comes from the urge to­\nward unique, creative self-realization. And this \nis a process in which one must repeatedly seek \nout and find something that is not yet known \nto anyone. The guiding hints or impulses come, \nnot from the ego, but from the totality of the \npsyche: the Self. \nIt is, moreover, useless to cast furtive glances \nat the way someone else is developing, because \neach of us has a unique task of self-realization. \nAlthough many human problems are similar, \nthey are never identical. All pine trees are very \nmuch alike (otherwise we should not recognize \nthem as pines), yet none is exactly the same as \nanother. Because of these factors of sameness \nand difference, it is difficult to summarize the \ninfinite variations of the process of individua­\ntion. The fact is that each person has to do \nsomething different, something that is uniquely \nhis own. \nMany people have criticized the Jungian \napproach for not presenting psychic material \nsystematically. But these critics forget that the \nmaterial itself is a living experience charged \nwith emotion, by nature irrational and ever-\nchanging, which does not lend itself to systema-\ntization except in the most superficial fashion. \nModern depth psychology has here reached the \nsame limits that confront microphysics. That is, \nwhen we are dealing with statistical averages, \na rational and systematic description of the facts \nis possible. But when we are attempting to de­\nscribe a single psychic event, we can do no more \nthan present an honest picture of it from as \nmany angles as possible. I n the same way, scien­\ntists have to admit that they do not know what \nlight is. They can say only that in certain ex­\nperimental conditions it seems to consist of par­\nticles, while in other experimental conditions it \nseems to consist of waves. But what it is \"in \nitself\" is not known. The psychology of the un­\nconscious and any description of the process of \nindividuation encounter comparable difficulties \nof definition. But I will try here to give a sketch \nof some of their most typical features.\n\f\nThe first approach of the unconscious \nFor most people the years of youth are char­\nacterized by a state of gradual awakening in \nwhich the individual slowly becomes aware of \nthe world and of himself. Childhood is a period \nof great emotional intensity, and a child's \nearliest dreams often manifest in symbolic form \nthe basic structure of the psyche, indicating how \nit will later shape the destiny of the individual \nconcerned. For example, J ting once told a group \nof students about a young woman who was so \nhaunted by anxiety that she committed suicide \nat the age of 26. As a small child, she had \ndreamed that \"Jack Frost\" had entered her \nroom while she was lyiilg in bed and pinched \nher on the stomach. She woke and discovered \nthat she had pinched herself with her own hand. \nThe dream did not frighten her; she merely re­\nmembered that she had bad such a dream. Hut \nthe fact that she did not react emotionally to \nher strange encounter with the demon of the \ncold of congealed life did not augur well for \nthe future and was itself abnormal. It was with \na cold, unfeeling hand that she later put an end \nto her life. From this single dream it is possible \nto deduce the tragic fate of the dreamer, which \nwas anticipated by her psyche in childhood. \nSometimes it is not a dream but some very \nimpressive and unforgettable real event that, \nlike a prophecy, anticipates the future in sym­\nbolic form. It is well known that children often \nforget events that seem impressive to adults but \nkeep a vivid recollection of some incident or \nstory that no one else has noticed. When we \nlook into one of these childhood memories, we \nusually find that it depicts (if interpreted as if \nit were a symbol) a basic problem of the child's \npsychic makeup. \nWhen a child reaches school age, the phase \nof building up the ego and of adapting to the \nouter world begins. This phase generally brings \na number of painful shocks. At the same time, \nsome children begin to feel very different from \nothers, and this feeling of being unique brings \na certain sadness that is part of the loneliness \nof many youngsters. The imperfections of the \nworld, and the evil within oneself as well as out-\nA child, adapting to the outside \nworld, receives many psychological \nshocks: far left, the fearful first \nday at school; center, the surprise \nand pain resulting from an attack \nby another child, left, the grief \nand bewilderment of the first \nexperience of death As in effect \na protection from such shocks, the \nchild may dream or draw a circular, \nquadrangular, nuclear motif (above) \nthat symbolizes the all important \ncenter of the psyche \n'65\n\f\nside, become conscious problems; the child must \ntry to cope with urgent (but not yet understood) \ninner impulses as well as the demands of the \nouter world. \nIf the development of consciousness is dis­\nturbed in its normal unfolding, children fre­\nquently retire from outer or inner difficulties \ninto an inner \"fortress\"; and when that hap­\npens, their dreams and symbolic drawings of \nunconscious material often reveal to an unusual \ndegree a type of circular, quadrangular, and \n\"nuclear\" motif (which I will explain later). \nThis refers to the previously mentioned psychic \nnucleus, the vital center of the personality from \nwhich the whole structural development of con­\nsciousness stems. It is natural that the image of \nthe (Ciller should appear in an especially strik­\ning way when the psychic life of the individual \nis threatened. From this central nucleus (as far \nas we know today), the whole building up of ego \nconsciousness is directed, the ego apparently be­\ning a duplicate or structural counterpart ol the \noriginal center. \nIn this early phase there are many children \nwho earnestly seek for some meaning in life that \ncould help them to deal with the chaos both \nwithin and outside themselves. There are others, \nhowever, who are still unconsciously carried \nalong by the dynamism of inherited and instinc­\ntive archetypal pat terns. These young people are \nnot concerned about the deeper meaning oflife, \nbecause their experiences with love, nature, \nsport, and work contain an immediate and \nsatisfying meaning for them. They are not neces­\nsarily more superficial; usually they are carried \nby the stream of life with less friction and dis­\nturbance than their more introspective fellows. \nIf I travel in a car or train without looking out, \nit is only the stops, starts, and sudden turns that \nmake me realise I am moving at all. \nThe actual process of individuation the con­\nscious coming-to-terms with one's own inner \ncenter (psychic nucleus) or Self—generally be­\ngins with a wounding of the personality and the \nsuffering that accompanies it. This initial shock \namounts to a sort of \"call,\" although it is not \noften recognized as such. On the contrary, the \nego feels hampered in its will or its desire and \nusually projects the obstruction onto something \nexternal. That is. the ego accuses God or Un­\neconomic situation or the boss or the marriage-\npartner of being responsible for whatever is \nobstructing it. \nOr perhaps everything seems outwardly all \nright, but beneath the surface a person is suffer­\ning from a deadly boredom that makes every-\n166\n\f\nthing seem meaningless and empty. Many \nmyths and fairy tales symbolically describe this \ninitial stage in the process of individuation by \ntelling of a king who has fallen ill or grown old. \nOther familiar story patterns are that a royal \ncouple is barren; or that a monster steals all the \nwomen, children, horses, and wealth of the king­\ndom; or that a demon keeps the king's army \nor his ship from proceeding on its course; or \nthat darkness hangs over the lands, wells dry \nup, and flood, drought, and frost afflict the \ncountry. Thus it seems as if the initial encounter \nwith the Self casts a dark shadow ahead of \ntime, or as if the \"inner friend\" comes at first \nlike a trapper to catch the helplessly struggling \nego in his snare. \nI n myths one finds that the magic or talisman \nthat can cure the misfortune of the king or his \ncountry always proves to be something very \nspecial. In one tale \"a white blackbird\"' or \"a \nfish that carries a golden ring in its gills'\" is \nneeded to restore the king's health. In another, \nthe king wants \"the water of life'\" or \"three \ngolden hairs from the head of the devil\" or \"a \nwoman's golden plait\" (and afterward, natur­\nally, the owner of the plait). Whatever it is, the \nthing that can drive away the evil is always \nunique and hard to find. \nIt is exactly the same in the initial crisis in \nthe life of an individual. One is seeking some­\nthing that is impossible to find or about which \nnothing is known. In such moments all well-\nmeant, sensible advice is completely useless-\nadvice that urges one to try to be responsible, \nto take a holiday, not to work so hard (or to \nwork harder), to have more (or less) human con­\ntact, or to take up a hobby. None of that helps, \nor at best only rarely. There is only one thing \nthat seems to work; and that is to turn directly \ntoward the approaching darkness without pre­\njudice and totally naively, and to try to find \nout what its secret aim is and what it wants \nfrom you. \nThe hidden purpose of the oncoming dark­\nness is generally something so unusual, so unique \nand unexpected, that as a rule one can find out \nwhat it is only by means of dreams and fanta­\nsies welling up from the unconscious. If one \nfocuses attention on the unconscious without \nrash assumptions or emotional rejection, it often \nbreaks through in a flow of helpful symbolic \nimages. But not always. Sometimes it first offers \na series of painful realizations of what is wrong \nwith oneself and one's conscious attitudes. Then \none must begin the process by swallowing all \nsorts of bitter truths. \nFar left, a woodcut from a 1 7th-\ncentury alchemical manuscript \ndepictsa king who has fallen ill — \na common symbolic image of the \nemptiness and boredom (in the \nconsciousness) that can mark the \ninitial stage of the individuation \nprocess. Left, from the 1 960 Italian \nfilm  La Dolce Vita,  another image \nof this psychological state: Guests \nexplore the run-down interior of \na decayed aristocrat's castle. \nRight, a painting by the modern \nSwiss artist Paul Klee entitled \nFairy Tale.  It illustrates a tale \nof a young man who sought and \nfound the \"bluebird of happiness.\" \nand so could marry a princess. \nIn many fairy tales such a talisman \nis necessary to cure illness or \nmisfortune, symbols of our \nfeelings of emptiness and futility.\n\f\nThe realization of the shadow \nWhether the unconscious comes up at first in \na helpful or a negative form, after a time the \nneed usually arises to readapt the conscious \nattitude in a better way to the unconscious fac­\ntors therefore to accept what seems to be \n\"criticism\" from the unconscious. Through \ndreams one becomes acquainted with aspects of \none's own personality that for various reasons \none has preferred not to look at too closely. \nThis is what Jung called \"the realization of the \nshadow.\" (He used the term \"shadow\" for this \nunconscious part of the personality because it \nactually often appears in dreams in a personi­\nfied form.) \nThe shadow is not the whole of the uncon­\nscious personality. It represents unknown or \nlittle-known attributes and qualities of the ego \n— aspects that mostly belong to the personal \nsphere and that could just as well be conscious. \nIn some aspects, the shadow can also consist of \ncollective factors that stem from a source out­\nside the individual's personal life. \nWhen an individual makes an attempt to see \nhis shadow, he becomes aware of (and often \nashamed of those qualities and impulses he \ndenies in himself but can plainly see in other \npeople such things as egotism, mental laziness, \nand sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and \nplots; carelessness and cowardice; inordinate \nlove of money and possessions in short, all Un­\nlit tie sins about which he might previously have \ntold himself: \"That doesn't matter; nobody \nwill notice it, and in any case other people \ndo it too.\" \nIf you feel an overwhelming rage coming up \nin you when a friend reproaches you about a \nfault, you can be fairly sure that at this point \nyou will find a part of your shadow, of which \nyou are unconscious. It is, of course, natural to \nbecome annoyed when others who are \"no bet­\nter\" criticize you because of shadow faults. But \nwhat can you say if your own dreams — an inner \njudge in your own being reproach you? That \nis the moment when the ego gets caught, and \nthe result is usually embarrassed silence. After­\nward the painful and lengthy work of self-edu­\ncation begins a work, we might say, that is \nthe psychological equivalent of the labors of \nHercules. This unfortunate hero's first task, you \nwill remember, was to clean up in one day the \nAugean Stables, in which hundreds of cattle had \ndiopprd theii dung for main decades a task \nThree examples of a \"collective \ninfection'\" that can weld people \ninto an irrational mob and to \nwhich the  shadow  (the dark side of \nthe ego-personality) is vulnerable \nLeft, a scene from a 1 961 Polish \nfilm concerning 1 7th century \nFrench nuns who were possessed \nby the devil \" Right, a drawing \nby Brueghel depicts the affliction \n(largely psychosomatic) called \"St \nVitus' Dance.\" which was widespread \nin the Middle Ages Far right, the \nfiery-cross emblem of the Ku Klux \nKlan, the white supremacy \"secret \nsociety\" of America s South whose \nracial intolerance has often led \nto acts of mob violence\n\f\nso enormous that the ordinary mortal would be \novercome by discouragement at the mere \nthought of it. \nThe shadow does not consist only of omis­\nsions. It shows up just as often in an impulsive \nor inadvertent act. Before one has time to think, \nthe evil remark pops out, the plot is hatched, \nthe wrong decision is made, and one is con­\nfronted with results that were never intended \nor consciously wanted. Furthermore, the sha­\ndow is exposed to collective infections to a much \ngreater extent than is the conscious personality. \nWhen a man is alone, for instance, he feels rela­\ntively all right; but as soon as \"the others\" do \ndark, primitive things, he begins to fear that if \nhe doesn't join in, he will be considered a fool. \nThus he gives way to impulses that do not really \nbelong to him at all. It is particularly in con­\ntacts with people of the same sex that one \nstumbles over both one's own shadow and those \nof other people. Although we do see the shadow \nin a person of the opposite sex, we are usually \nmuch less annoyed by it and can more easily \npardon it. \nIn dreams and myths, therefore, the shadow \nappeals as a person of the same sex as that of \nthe dreamer. The following dream may serve \nas an example. The dreamer was a man of 48 \nwho tried to live very much for and bv him­\nself, working hard and disciplining himself, re­\npressing pleasure and spontaneity to a far \ngreater extent than suited his real nature. \n1 owned and inhabited a very big house in \ntown, and I didn't yet know all its different parts. \nSo I took a walk through it and discovered, \nmainly in the cellar, several rooms about which \nI knew nothing and even exits leading into other \ncellars or into subterranean streets. I felt uneasy \nwhen I found that several of these exits were not \nlocked and some had no locks at all. Moreover, \nthere were some laborers at work in the neighbor­\nhood who could have sneaked in. . . . \nWhen I came up again to the ground floor, I \npassed a back yard where again I discovered dil-\nferent exits into the street or into other houses. \nWhen I tried to investigate them mote closely, a \nman came up to me laughing loudly and calling \nout that we were old pa Is from the elementary \nschool. I remembered him too, and while he was \ntelling me about his life, I walked along with him \ntoward the exit and strolled with him through the \nstreets. \nThere was a strange chiaroscuro in the air as \nwe walked through an enormous circular street\n\f\nand arrived at a green lawn where three gallop­\ning horses suddenly passed us. They were beauti­\nful, strong animals, wild but well-groomed, and \nthey had no rider with them. (Had they run away \nfrom military service?) \nThe maze of strange passages, chambers, and \nunlocked exits in the cellar recalls the old \nEgyptian representation of the underworld, \nwhich is a well-known symbol of the uncon­\nscious with its unknown possibilities. It also \nshows how one is \"open\" to other influences in \none's unconscious shadow side, and how un­\ncanny and alien elements can break in. The \ncellar, one can say, is the basement of the \ndreamer's psyche. In the back yard of the \nstrange building (which represents the still un-\nperceived psychic scope of the dreamer's person­\nality) an old school friend suddenly turns up. \nThis person obviously personifies another aspect \nof the dreamer himself—an aspect that had \nbeen part of his life as a child but that he had \nforgotten and lost. It often happens that a per­\nson's childhood qualities (for instance, gaiety, \nirascibility, or perhaps trustfulness) suddenly \ndisappear, and one does not know where or how \nthey have gone. It is such a lost characteristic \nof the dreamer that now returns (from the back \nyard) and tries to make friends again. This \nfigure probably stands for the dreamer's \nneglected capacity for enjoying life and for his \nextraverted shadow side. \nBut we soon learn why the dreamer feels \"un­\neasy \"just before meeting this seemingly harm­\nless old friend. When he strolls with him in the \nstreet, the horses break loose. The dreamer \nthinks they may have escaped from military \nservice (that is to say, from the conscious disci­\npline that has hitherto characterized his life). \nThe fact that the horses have no rider shows \nthat instinctive drives can get away from con­\nscious control. In this old friend, and in the \nhorses, all the positive force reappears that was \nlacking before and that was badly needed by \nthe dreamer. \nThis is a problem that often comes up when \none meets one's \"other side.\" The shadow usu­\nally contains values that are needed by consci­\nousness, but that exist in a form that makes it \ni 70\n\f\nLeft,  Anxious Journey  by the modern \nItalian artist de Chirico. The title \nand gloomy passages of the painting \nexpress the nature of the first \ncontact with the unconscious when \nthe individuation process begins. \nThe unconscious is often symbolized \nby corridors, labyrinths, or mazes: \nRight, on a papyrus (c, 1400 B.C.), \nthe seven doors of the Egyptian \nunderworld, itself seen as a maze. \nBelow, drawings of three mazes: \nleft to right, a Finnish stone maze \n(Bronze Age): a 19th century British \nturf maze: and a maze (in tiles) on \nthe floor of Chartres Cathedral \n(it could be walked as a symbolic \npilgrimage to the Holy Land). \ndifficult to integrate them into one's life. The \npassages and the large house in this dream also \nshow that the dreamer does not yet know his \nown psychic dimensions and is not yet able to \nfill them out. \nThe shadow in this dream is typical for an \nintrovert fa man who tends to retire too much \nfrom outer life). In the case of an cxtravert, who \nis turned more toward outer objects and outer \nlife, the shadow would look quite different. \nA young man who had a very lively tempera­\nment embarked again and again on successful \nenterprises, while at the same time his dreams \ninsisted that he should finish off a piece of pri­\nvate creative work he had begun. The follow­\ning was one of those dreams: \nA man is lying on a couch and has pulled the \ncover over his face. He is a Frenchman, a des­\nperado who would take on any criminal job. An \nofficial is accompanying me downstairs, and I \nknow that a plot has been made against me: \nnamely, that the Frenchman should kill me as if \nby chance. (That is how it would look from the \noutside.) He actually sneaks up behind me when \nwe approach the exit, but I am on my guard. A \ntall, portly man (rather rich and influential) sud­\ndenly leans against the wall beside me, feeling ill. \nI quickly grab the opportunity to kill the official \nby stabbing his heart. \"One only notices a bit of \nmoisture\"—this is said like a comment. Now I \nam safe, for the Frenchman won't attack me since \nthe man who gave him his orders is dead. (Prob­\nably the official and the successful portly man \nare the same person, the latter somehow replacing \nthe former.) \nThe desperado represents the other side of \nthe dreamer—his introversion —which has \nreached a completely destitute state. He lies on \na couch (i.e. he is passive) and pulls the cover \nover his face because he wants to be left alone. \nThe official, on the other hand, and the prosper­\nous portly man (who are secretly the same per­\nson ) personify the dreamer's successful outer re­\nsponsibilities and activities. The sudden illness \nof the portly man is connected with the fact that \nthis dreamer had in fact become ill several times \nwhen he had allowed his dynamic energy to ex­\nplode too forcibly in his external life. But this \n'7'\n\f\nsuccessful man has no blood in his veins only \na sort of moisture which means that these ex­\nternal ambitious activities of the dreamer con­\ntain no genuine life and no passion, but are \nbloodless mechanisms. Thus it would be no real \nloss if the portly man were killed. At the end of \nthe dream, the Frenchman is satisfied; he obvi­\nously represents a positive shadow figure who \nhad turned negative and dangerous only be­\ncause the conscious attitude of the dreamer did \nnot agree with him. \nThis dream shows us that the shadow can \nconsist of many different elements for in­\nstance, of unconscious ambition (the successful \nportly man) and of introversion (the French­\nman). This particular dreamer's association to \nthe French, moreover, was that they know how \nto handle love affairs very well. Therefore the \ntwo shadow figures also represent two well-\nknown drives: power and sex. The power drive \nappears momentarily in a double form, both as \nan official and as a successful man. The official, \nor civil servant, personifies collective adapta­\ntion, whereas the successful man denotes ambi­\ntion ; but naturally both serve the power drive. \nWhen the dreamer succeeds in stopping this \ndangerous inner force, the Frenchman is sud­\ndenly no longer hostile. In other words, the \nequally dangerous aspect of the sex drive has \nalso surrendered. \nObviously, the problem of the shadow plays \na great role in all political conflicts. If the man \nwho had this dream had not been sensible about \nhis shadow problem, he could easily have iden­\ntified the desperate Frenchman with the \"dan­\ngerous Communists'' of outer life, or the official \nplus the prosperous man with the \"grasping \ncapitalists.\" In this way he would have avoided \nseeing that he had within him such warring \nelements. If people observe their own uncon­\nscious tendencies in other people, this is called \na \"projection.\" Political agitation in all coun­\ntries is full of such projections, just as much as \nthe back-yard gossip of little groups and indi­\nviduals. Projections of all kinds obscure our \nview of our fellow men, spoiling its objectivity, \nand thus spoiling all possibility of genuine \nhuman relationships. \n'72 \n\"For over live years this man \nhas been chasing around Europe \nlike a madman in search of \nsomething he could set on lire. \nUntoitunalely he again and \nagain finds hirelings who \nopen the gates ol their country \nto this international incendiaiy \"\n\f\nAnd there is an additional disadvantage in \nprojecting our shadow. If we identify our own \nshadow with, say, the Communists or the capi­\ntalists, a part of our own personality remains \non the opposing side. The result is that we shall \nconstantly (though involuntarily) do things he-\nhind our own backs that support this other side, \nand thus we shall unwittingly help our enemy. \nIf, on the contrary, we realize the projection and \ncan discuss matters without fear or hostility, \ndealing with the other person sensibly, then \nthere is a chance of mutual understanding or \nat least of a truce. \nWhether the shadow becomes our friend or \nenemy depends largely upon ourselves. As the \ndreams of the unexplored house and the French \ndesperado both show, the shadow is not neces­\nsarily always an opponent. In fact, he is exactly \nlike any human being with whom one has to get \nalong, sometimes by giving in, sometimes by re­\nsisting, sometimes by giving love whatever the \nsituation requires. The shadow becomes hostile \nonly when he is ignored or misunderstood. \nSometimes, though not often, an individual \nfeels impelled to live out the worse side of his \nnature and to repress his better side. In such \ncases the shadow appears as a positive figure in \nhis dreams. But to a person who lives out his \nnatural emotions and feelings, the shadow may \nappear as a cold and negative intellectual; it \nthen personifies poisonous judgments and nega­\ntive thoughts that have been held back. So, \nwhatever form it takes, the function of the \nshadow is to represent the opposite side of the \nego and to embody just those qualities that one \ndislikes most in other people. \nIt would be relatively easy if one could inte­\ngrate the shadow into the conscious personality \njust by attempting to be honest and to use one's \ninsight. But, unfortunately, such an attempt \ndoes not always work. There is such a passionate \ndrive within the shadowy part of oneself that \nreason may not prevail against it. A bitter ex­\nperience coming from the outside may occa­\nsionally help; a brick, so to speak, has to drop \non one's head to put a stop to shadow drives \nand impulses. At times a heroic decision may \nserve to halt them, but such a superhuman \neffort is usually possible only if the Creat Man \nwithin (the Self) helps the individual to carry \nit through. \nThe fact that the shadow contains the over­\nwhelming power of irresistible impulse does not \nmean, however, that the drive should always be \nheroically repressed. Sometimes the shadow is \npowerful because the urge of the Self is point­\ning in the same direction, and so one does not \nknow whether it is the Self or the shadow that \nis behind the inner pressure. In the unconscious, \none is unfortunately in the same situation as in \na moonlit landscape: All the contents arc \nblurred and merge into one another, and one \nnever knows exactly what or where anything \nis, or where one thing begins and ends. (This is \nknown as the \"contamination\" of unconscious \ncontents.) \nWhen Jung called one aspect of the uncon­\nscious personality the shadow, he was referring \nto a relatively well-defined factor. But some­\ntimes everything that is unknown to the ego is \nmixed up with the shadow, including even the \nmost valuable and highest forces. Who, for in-\nRather than face our defects as \nrevealed by the shadow  wepro/ect \nthem on to others for instance, \non to our political enemies Above \nleft, a poster made for a parade \nin Communist China shows America \nas an evil serpent (bearing Nazi \nswastikas) killed by a Chinese hand \nLeft, Hitler during a speech; the \nquotation is  his description of \nChurchill Projections also flourish \nin malicious gossip (right from \nthe British television series \nCoronation Street)\n\f\nAbove, the wild white stallion from \nthe 1 953 French film  Crin Blanc \nWild horses often symbolize the \nuncontrollable instinctive drives \nthat can erupt from the unconscious \n— and that many people try to repress. \nIn the film, the horse and a boy \nform a strong attachment (though \nthe horse still runs wild with his \nherd). But local horsemen set out \nto capture the wild horses. The \nstallion and his boy rider are \npursued for miles; finally they \nare cornered on the seashore. \nRather than submit to capture, the \nboy and the horse plunge into the \nsea to be swept away Symbolically, \nthe story's end seems to represent \nan escape into the unconscious \n(the sea) as a way to avoid facing \nreality in the outside world.\n\f\nstance, could be quite sure whether the French \ndesperado in the dream I quoted was a useless \ntramp or a most valuable introvert? And the \nbolting horses of the preceding dream — should \nthey be allowed to run free or not? In a case \nwhen the dream itself does not make things \nclear, the conscious personality will have to \nmake the decision. \nIf the shadow figure contains valuable, vital \nforces, they ought to be assimilated into actual \nexperience and not repressed. It is up to the ego \nto give up its pride and priggishness and to live \nout something that seems to be dark, but actu­\nally may not be. This can require a sacrifice \njust as heroic as the conquest of passion, but \nin an opposite sense. \nThe ethical difficulties that arise when one \nmeets one's shadow are well described in the \n18th Book of the Koran. In this tale Moses \nmeets Khidr (\"the Green One\" or \"first angel \nof God\") in the desert. They wander along to­\ngether, and Khidr expresses his fear that Moses \nwill not be able to witness his deeds without \nindignation. If Moses cannot bear with him and \ntrust him, Khidr will have to leave. \nPresently Khidr scuttles the fishing boat of \nsome poor villagers. Then, before Moses's eyes, \nhe kills a handsome young man, and finally he \nrestores the fallen wall of a city of unbelievers. \nMoses cannot help expressing his indignation, \nand so Khidr has to leave him. Before his de­\nparture, however, he explains the reasons for \nhis actions: By scuttling the boat he actu­\nally saved it for its owners because pirates \nwere on their way to steal it. As it is, the fisher­\nmen can salvage it. The handsome young man \nwas on his way to commit a crime, and by kill­\ning him Khidr saved his pious parents from \ninfamy. By restoring the wall, two pious young \nmen were saved from ruin because their trea­\nsure was buried under it. Moses, who had been \nso morally indignant, saw now (too late) that \nhis judgment had been too hasty. Khidr's doings \nhad seemed to be totally evil, but in fact they \nwere not. \nLooking at this story naively, one might \nassume that Khidr is the lawless, capricious, \nevil shadow of pious, law-abiding Moses. But \nthis is not the case. Khidr is much more the per­\nsonification of some secret creative actions of \nthe Godhead. (One can find a similar meaning \nin the famous Indian story of \"The King and \nthe Corpse\" as interpreted by Henry Zimmer.) \nIt is no accident that I have not quoted a dream \nto illustrate this subtle problem. I have chosen \nthis well-known story from the Koran because \nit sums up the experience of a lifetime, which \nwould very rarely be expressed with such clarity \nin an individual dream. \nWhen dark figures turn up in our dreams and \nseem to want something, we cannot be sure \nwhether they personify merely a shadowy part of \nourselves, or the Self, or both at the same time. \nDivining in advance whether our dark partner \nsymbolizes a shortcoming that we should \novercome or a meaningful bit of life that we \nThe shadow can be said to have two \naspects, one dangerous, the other \nvaluable The painting of the Hindu \ngod Vishnu, far left, images such \na duality: Usually considered a \nbenevolent god, Vishnu here appears \nin a demonic aspect, tearing a man \napart Left, from a Japanese \ntemple (AD 759), a sculpture of \nBuddha also expresses duality: \nThe god's many arms hold symbols \nof both good and evil Right, the \ndoubt-stricken Martin Luther \n(portrayed by Albert Finney in the \n1961 play  Luther  by Britain's John \nOsborne): Luther was never sure \nwhether his break from the Church \nwas inspired by God or arose from \nhis own pride and obstinacy (in \nsymbolic terms, the \"evil\" side \nof his shadow).\n\f\nshould accept this is one of the most difficult \nproblems that we encounter on the way to indi­\nviduation. Moreover, the dream symbols are \noften so subtle and complicated that one can­\nnot be sure of their interpretation. In such a \nsituation all one can do is accept the discom­\nfort of ethical doubt — making no final decisions \nor commitments and continuing to watch the \ndreams. This resembles the situation of Cinder­\nella when her stepmother threw a heap of good \nand bad peas in front of her and asked her to \nsort them out. Although it seemed quite hope­\nless, Cinderella began patiently to sort the peas, \nand suddenly doves (or ants, in some versions) \ncame to help her. These creatures symbolize \nhelpful, deeply unconscious impulses that can \nonly be felt in one's body, as it were, and that \npoint to a way out. \nSomewhere, right at the bottom of one's own \nbeing, one generally does know where one \nshould go and what one should do. But there \nare times when the clown we call \"I\" behaves \nin such a distracting fashion that the inner voice \ncannot make its presence felt. \nSometimes all attempts to understand the \nhints of the unconscious fail, and in such a \ndifficulty one can only have the courage to do \nwhat seems to be right, while being ready to \nchange course if the suggestions of the uncon­\nscious should suddenly point in another direc­\ntion. It may also happen (although this is \nunusual) that a person will find it better to \nresist the urge of the unconscious, even at the \nprice of feeling warped by doing so, rather than \ndepart too far from the state of being human. \n(This would be the situation of people who \nhad to live out a criminal disposition in order \ntf) be completely themselves.) \nThe strength and inner clarity needed by the \nego in order to make such a decision stem \nsecretly from the Great Man, who appar­\nently does not want to reveal himself too clearly. \nIt may be that the Self wants the ego to make \na free choice, or it may be that the Self depends \non human consciousness and its decisions to \nhelp him to become manifest. When it comes \nto such difficult ethical problems, no one can \ntruly judge the deeds of others. Each man has \nto look to his own problem and try to determine \nwhat is right for himself. As an old Zen Budd­\nhist Master said, we must follow the example \nof the cowherd who watches his ox \"with a \nstick so that it will not graze on other people's \nmeadows.\" \nThese new discoveries of depth psychology \nare bound to make some change in our collective \nethical views, for they will compel us to judge \nall human actions in a much more individual \nand subtle way. The discovery of the uncon­\nscious is one of the most far-reaching discov­\neries of recent times. But the fact that \nrecognition of its unconscious reality involves \nhonest self-examination and reorganization of \none's life causes many people to continue to \nbehave as if nothing at all has happened. It \ntakes a lot of courage to take the unconscious \nseriously and to tackle the problems it raises. \nMost people are too indolent to think deeply \nabout even those moral aspects of their beha­\nvior of which they are conscious; they are cer­\ntainly too lazy to consider how the unconscious \naffects them. \n176\n\f\nThe anima: the woman within \nDifficult and subtle ethical problems are not in­\nvariably brought up by the appearance of the \nshadow itself. Often another \"inner figure\" \nemerges. If the dreamer is a man, he will dis­\ncover a female personification of his uncon­\nscious; and it will be a male figure in the case \nof a woman. Often this second symbolic figure \nturns up behind the shadow, bringing up new \nand different problems. Jung called its male \nand female forms \"animus\" and \"anima.\" \nThe anima is a personification of all feminine \npsychological tendencies in a man's psyche, such \nas vague feelings and moods, prophetic hunches, \nreceptiveness to the irrational, capacity for per­\nsonal love, feeling for nature, and — last but not \nleast — his relation to the unconscious. It is no \nmere chance that in olden times priestesses (like \nthe Greek Sibyl) were used to fathom the divine \nwill and to make connection with the gods. \nA particularly good example of how the \nanima is experienced as an inner figure in a \nman's psyche is found in the medicine men and \nprophets (shamans) among the Eskimo and \nother arctic tribes. Some of these even wear \nwomen's clothes, or have breasts depicted on \ntheir garments, in order to manifest their inner \nfeminine side — the side that enables them to \nconnect with the \"ghost land\" (i.e. what we \ncall the unconscious). \nOne reported case tells of a young man who \nwas being initiated by an older shaman and \nwho was buried by him in a snow hole. He fell \ninto a state of dreaminess and exhaustion. In \nthis coma he suddenly saw a woman who \nemitted light. She instructed him in all he \nneeded to know and later, as his protective \nspirit, helped him to practice his difficult pro­\nfession by relating him to the powers of the be-\nThe anima (the female element in \na male psyche) is often personified \nas a witch or a priestess — women \nwho have links with \"forces of \ndarkness\" and \"the spirit world\" \n(i.e. the unconscious).

Such an experience shows the anima as \nthe personification of a man's unconscious. \nIn its individual manifestation the character \nof a man's anima is as a rule shaped by his \nmother. If he feels that his mother had a nega­\ntive influence on him, his anima will often ex­\npress itself in irritable, depressed moods, \nuncertainty, insecurity, and touchiness. (If, \nhowever, he is able to overcome the negative \nassaults on himself, they can even serve to re­\ninforce his masculinity.) Within the soul of such \na man the negative mother-anima figure will \nendlessly repeat this theme: \"I am nothing. \nNothing makes any sense. With others it's differ­\nent, but for me ... I enjoy nothing.\" These \n\"anima moods\" cause a sort of dullness, a fear \nof disease, of impotence, or of accidents. The \nwhole of life takes on a sad and oppressive \naspect. Such dark moods can even lure a man \nto suicide, in which case the anima becomes a \ndeath demon. She appears in this role in \nCocteau's film Orphee. \nThe French call such an anima figure a \nfemme fatale. (A milder version of this dark \nanima is personified by the Queen of the Night \nin Mozart's Magic Flute.) The Greek Sirens or \nthe German Lorelei also personify this dan­\ngerous aspect of the anima, which in this form \nsymbolizes destructive illusion. The following \nSiberian tale illustrates the behavior of such a \ndestructive anima: \nOne day a lonely hunter sees a beautiful \nwoman emerging from the deep forest on the \nother side of the river. She waves at him and \nsings: \nOh. come, lonely hunter in the stillness of dusk. \nCome, come! I miss you. I miss you! \nNow I will embrace you. embrace you! \nCome, come! My nest is near, my nest is near. \nCome, come, lonely hunter, now in the stillness \nof dusk. \nHe throws oil his clothes and swims across the \nriver, but suddenly she Hies awav in the form \"I \nan owl. laughing mockingly at him. When he \ntries to swim back to find his clothes, he drowns \nin the cold river. \nIn this tale the anima symbolizes an unreal \ndream of love, happiness, and maternal warmth \n(her nest) — a dream that lures men away from \nThe anima (like the shadow) has \ntwo aspects, benevolent and malefic \n(or negative) Left, a scene from \nOrphee (a film version by Cocteau \nof the Orpheus myth): The woman \ncan be seen as a lethal anima. for \nshe has led Orpheus (being carried \nby dark \"underworld'' figures) to \nhis doom.

Below right, a \nparallel from Slavonic myth: the \nRusalka. These beings were thought \nto be spirits of drowned girls who \nbewitch and drown passing men. \n.78\n\f\nreality. The hunter is drowned because he ran \nafter a wishful fantasy that could not be \nfulfilled. \nAnother way in which the negative anima in \na man's personality can be revealed is in \nwaspish, poisonous, effeminate remarks by \nwhich he devalues everything. Remarks of this \nsort always contain a cheap twisting of the truth \nand are in a subtle way destructive. There are \nlegends throughout the world in which \"a \npoison damsel\" (as they call her in the Orient) \nappears. She is a beautiful creature who has \nweapons hidden in her body or a secret poison \nwith which she kills her lovers during their first \nnight together. In this guise the anima is as \ncold and reckless as certain uncanny aspects of \nnature itself, and in Europe is often expressed \nto this day by the belief in witches. \nII, on the other hand, a man's experience of \nhis mother has been positive, this can also affect \nhis anima in typical but different ways, with \nthe result that he either becomes effeminate or \nis preyed upon by women and thus is unable \nto cope with the hardships of life. An anima of \nthis sort can turn men into sentimentalists, or \nthey may become as touchy as old maids or as \nsensitive as the fairy-tale princess who could \nfeel a pea under 30 mattresses. A still more \nsubtle manifestation of a negative anima \nappears in some fairy tales in the form of a \nprincess who asks her suitors to answer a series \nof riddles or, perhaps, to hide themselves under \nher nose. If they cannot give the answers, or if \nshe can find them, they must die and she in­\nvariably wins. The anima in this guise involves \nmen in a destructive intellectual game. We can \nnotice the effect of this anima trick in all those \nneurotic pseudo-intellectual dialogues that in­\nhibit a man from getting into direct touch with \nlife and its real decisions. He reflects about life \nso much that he cannot live it and loses all his \nspontaneity and outgoing feeling. \nThe most frequent manifestation of the \nanima takes the form of erotic fantasy. Men \nmay be driven to nurse their fantasies by look­\ning at films and strip-tease shows, or by day­\ndreaming over pornographic material. This is a \ncrude, primitive aspect of the anima, which \nAbove, four scenes from the 1 930 \nGerman film  The Blue Angel,  which \nconcerns a strait-laced professor's \ninfatuation with a cabaret singer, \nclearly a negative anima figure \nThe girl uses her charm to degrade \nthe professor, even making him \na buffoon in her cabaret act. \nRight, a drawing of Salome with \nthe head of John the Baptist, \nwhom she had killed to prove her \npower over King Herod\n\f\nAbove, a painting by the 1 5th century \nItalian artist Stefano di Giovanni \ndepicting St. Anthony confronted by \nan attractive young girl.

The film is concerned with \nthe exploits of a  femme fatale \n(played by the French actress Jeanne \nMoreau) —a widely known term for \nthe \"dangerous\" women whose \nrelationships with men clearly image \nthe nature of the negative anima. \nThe following is a description \n(taken from the poster above) of \nthe central character of the film \n(a melodramatic description, but one \nthat might fit many personifications \nof the negative anima): \"Mysterious \ntantalizing — alluring -wanton-\nbut deep within her burning the \nviolent fires that destroy a man.\" \nbecomes compulsive only when a man does not \nsufficiently cultivate his feeling relationships-\nwhen his feeling attitude toward life has \nremained infantile. \nAll these aspects of the anima have the same \ntendency that we have observed in the shadow: \nThat is, they can be projected so that they \nappear to the man to be the qualities of some \nparticular woman. It is the presence of the \nanima that causes a man to fall suddenly in \nlove when he sees a woman for the first time \nand knows at once that this is \"she.\" In this \nsituation, the man feels as if he has known this \nwoman intimately for all time; he falls for her \nso helplessly that it looks to outsiders like com­\nplete madness. Women who are of \"fairy-like\" \ncharacter especially attract such anima projec­\ntions, because men can attribute almost any­\nthing to a creature who is so fascinatingly \nvague, and can thus proceed to weave fanta­\nsies around her. \nThe projection of the anima in such a sud­\nden and passionate form as a love affair can \ngreatly disturb a man's marriage and can lead \nto the so-called \"human triangle,\" with its \naccompanying difficulties. A bearable solution \nto such a drama can be found only if the anima \nis recognized as an inner power. The secret aim \nof the unconscious in bringing about such an \nentanglement is to force a man to develop and \nto bring his own being to maturity by integrat­\ning more of his unconscious personality and \nbringing it into his real life. \nBut I have said enough about the negative \nside of the anima. There are just as many im­\nportant positive aspects. The anima is, for \ninstance, responsible for the fact that a man is \nable to find the right marriage partner. Another \nfunction is at least equally important: When­\never a man's logical mind is incapable of dis­\ncerning facts that are hidden in his unconscious, \nthe anima helps him to dig them out. Even \nmore vital is the role that the anima plays in \nputting a man's mind in tune with the right \ninner values and thereby opening the way into \nmore profound inner depths. It is as if an inner \n\"radio\" becomes tuned to a certain wavelength \nthat excludes irrelevancies but allows the voice \nof the Great Man to be heard.

That is how she appears \nin the example of the initiations of shamans \nthat I described earlier; this is the role of Bea­\ntrice in Dante's Paradiso, and also of the god­\ndess Isis when she appeared in a dream to \nApuleius, the famous author of The Golden \nAss, in order to initiate him into a higher, more \nspiritual form of life. \nThe dream of a 45-year-old psychotherapist \nmay help to make clear how the anima can be \nan inner guide. As he was going to bed on the \nevening before he had this dream, he thought \nto himself that it was hard to stand alone in \nlife, lacking the support of a church. He found \nhimself envying people who are protected by \nthe maternal embrace of an organization. (He \nhad been born a Protestant but no longer had \nany religious affiliation.) This was his dream: \nI am in the aisle of an old church filled with \npeople. Together with my mother and my wife, \nI sit at the end of the aisle in what seem to be \nextra seats. \nI am to celebrate the Mass as a priest, and I \nhave a big Mass book in my hands, or, rather, a \nprayer book or an anthology of poems. This book \nis not familiar to me, and I cannot find the right \ntext. I am very excited because I have to begin \nsoon, and, to add to my troubles, my mother and \nwife disturb me by chattering about unimportant \ntrifles. Now the organ stops, and everybody is \nwaiting for me, so I get up in a determined way \nand ask one of the nuns who is kneeling behind \nme to hand me her Mass book and point out the \nright place which she does in an obliging man­\nner. Now, like a sort of sexton, this same nun pre­\ncedes me to the altar, which is somewhere behind \nme and to the left, as if we are approaching it \nfrom a side aisle. The Mass book is like a sheet of \npictures, a sort of board, three feet long and a \nfoot wide, and on it is the text with ancient pic­\ntures in columns, one beside the other. \nFirst the nun has to read a part of the liturgy \nbefore I begin, and 1 have still not found the right \nplace in the text. She has told me that it is Num­\nber 15, but the numbers are not clear, and I can­\nnot find it. With determination, however, I turn \ntoward the congregation, and now I have found \nNumber 15 (the next to the last on the board), \nalthough I do not yet know if I shall be able to \ndecipher it. I want to try all the same. I wake up. \nMen project the anima on to things \nas well as women. For instance, \nships are always known as \"she\"' \nabove, the female figurehead on \nthe old British clipper ship \nCutty Sark.  The captain of a ship \nis symbolically \"her\" husband, \nwhich may be why he must \n(according to tradition) go down \nwith the ship if \"she\" sinks. \nA car is another kind of possession \nthat is usually feminized — i.e. that \ncan become the focus of many men's \nanima projections. Like ships, cars \nare called \"she.'' and their owners \ncaress and pamper them (below) \nlike favorite mistresses. \nI 83\n\f\n'Illis dream expressed in a symbolic way an \nanswer from the unconscious to the thoughts \nthat the dreamer had had the evening before. \nIt said to him, in effect: \"You yourself must \nbecome a priest in your own inner church in \nthe church of your soul.\"\" Thus the dream \nshows that the dreamer does have the helpful \nsupport of an organization: he is contained in \na church not an external church but one that \nexists inside his own soul. \nThe people (all his own psychic qualities) \nwant him to function as the priest and celebrate \nthe Mass himself. Now the dream cannot mean \nthe actual Mass. for its Mass book is very dif­\nferent from the real one. It seems that the idea \nof the Mass is used as a symbol, and therefore \nit means a sacrificial act in which the Divinity \nis present so that man can communicate with \nit. This symbolic solution is. of course, not gen­\nerally valid but relates to this particular \ndreamer. It is a typical solution for a Protes­\ntant, because a man who through real faith is \n184 \nTwo stages in the development of \nthe anima: First, primitive woman \n(above, from a painting by Gauguin); \nsecond, romanticized beauty —as in \nthe idealized portrait, left, of a \nRenaissance Italian girl who is \ndepicted as Cleopatra The second \nstage was classically embodied in \nHelen of Troy (below, with Pans)\n\f\nstill contained in the Catholic Church usually \nexperiences his anima in the image of the \nChurch herself, and her sacred images are for \nhim the symbols of the unconscious. \nOur dreamer did not have this ecclesiastical \nexperience, and this is why he had to follow an \ninner way. Furthermore, the dream told him \nwhat he should do. It said: \"Your mother-\nboundness and your cxtravcrsion represented \nby the wife who is an cxtravert distract you \nand make you feel insecure, and by meaning­\nless talk keep you from celebrating the inner \nMass. But if you follow the nun (the introverted \nanima . she will lead you as both a servant and \na priest. She owns a strange Mass book which \nis composed of 16 four times four ancient pic­\ntures. Your Mass consists of your contemplation \nof these psychic images that your religious \nanima reveals to you.\"' In other words, if the \ndreamer overcomes his inner uncertainty, \ncaused by his mother complex, he will find that \nhis life (ask has the nature and quality of a \nreligious service and that if he meditates about \nthe symbolic meaning of the images in his soul, \nihc\\ will lead him to this realization. \nIn this dream the anima appears in her pro­\nper positive role that is. as a mediator between \nthe ego and the Self. The four-times-four con­\nfiguration of the pictures points to the fact that \nthe celebration of this inner Mass is performed \nin the service of totality. As Jung has demon­\nstrated, the nucleus of the psyche (the Sell\" \nnormally expresses itself in some kind of four­\nfold structure. The number four is also con­\nnected with the anima because, as Jung noted, \nthere are four stages in its development. The \nfirst stage is best symbolized by the figure of \nEve, which represents purely instinctual and \nbiological relations. The second can be seen in \nFaust's Helen: She personifies a romantic and \naesthetic level that is. however, still character­\nized by sexual elements. The third is represen­\nted, for instance, by the Virgin Mary a figure \nwho raises love eros to the heights of spiritual \ndevotion. The fourth type is symbolized by \nSapientia. wisdom transcending even the most \nholy and the most pure. Of this another symbol \nis the Shulamite in the Song of Solomon. (In the \nAbove, the anima's third stage is \npersonified asthe Virgin Mary (in \na painting by van Eyck). The red of \nher robe is the symbolic color of \nfeeling (or  eros):  but in this stage \nthe  eros  has become spiritualized. \nBelow, two examples of the fourth \nstage: the Greek goddess of wisdom \nAthena (left), and the  Mona Lisa. \n'85\n\f\npsychic development of modern man this stage \nis rarely reached. I he Mona Lisa comes nearest \nto such a wisdom anima.) \nAt this stage I am only pointing out that the \nconcept of fourfoldness frequently occurs in \ncertain types of symbolic material. The essen­\ntial aspects of this will be discussed later. \nBut what does the role of the anima as guide \nto the inner world mean in practical terms? \nThis positive function occurs when a man takes \nseriously the feelings, moods, expectations, and \nfantasies sent by his anima and when he fixes \nthem in some form for example, in writing, \npainting, sculpture, musical composition, or \ndancing. When he works at this patiently and \nslowly, other more deeply unconscious material \nwells up from the depths and connects with the \nearlier material. After a fantasy has been fixed \nin some specific form, it must be examined both \nintellectually and ethically, with an evaluating \nfeeling reaction. And it is essential to regard it \nas being absolutely real; there must be no lurk­\ning doubt that this is \"only a fantasy.\"\" If this \nis practiced with devotion over a long period, \nthe process of individuation gradually becomes \nthe single reality and can unfold in its true form. \nMany examples from literature show the \nanima as a guide and mediator to the inner \nworld: Francesco Colonna's Hypnerolomachia, \nRider Haggard's She, or \"the eternal feminine\" \nin Goethe's Faust. In a medieval mystical text, \nan anima figure explains her own nature \nas follows: \nI am the flower of the field and the lily of the \nvalleys. I am the mother of lair love and of fear \nand of knowledge and of holy hope. ... I am \nthe mediator of the elements, making one to agree \nwitli another; that which is warm I make cold \nand the reverse, and that which is dry I make \nmoist and the reverse, and that which is hard I \nsoften. ... I am the law in the priest and the \nword in the prophet and the counsel in the wise. \nI will kill and I will make to live and there is \nnone that can deliver out of my hand. \nIn the Middle Ages there took place a per­\nceptible spiritual differentiation in religious, \npoetical, and other cultural matters; and the \nfantasy world of the unconscious was recog-\nLeft, a 17th-century engraving \ndominated by the symbolic figure \nof the anima as mediator between \nthis world (the monkey, probably \nrepresenting man's instinctual \nnature) and the next (the hand of \nGod, reaching from the clouds). \nThe anima figure seems to parallel \nthe woman of the Apocalypse, who \nalso wore a crown of 1 2 stars; \nantiquity's moon goddesses; the \nOld Testament's Sapientia (the \nfourth stage of the anima, p. 185); \nand the Egyptian goddess Isis (who \nalso had flowing hair, a half-moon \nat her womb, and stood with one \nfoot on land and one on water). \nRight, the anima as mediator (or \nguide) in a drawing by William \nBlake: It illustrates a scene from \nthe \"Purgatorio\" of Dante's  Divine \nComedy,  and shows Beatrice leading \nDante along a symbolically tortuous \nmountain path Far right, from \nan early film of Rider Haggard's \nnovel  She,  a mysterious woman \nleads explorers through mountains. \n18b\n\f\nnizcd more clearly than before. During this \nperiod, the knightly cult of the lady signified \nan attempt to differentiate the feminine side of \nman's nature in regard to the outer woman as \nwell as in relation to the inner world. \nThe lady to whose service the knight pledged \nhimself, and for whom he performed his heroic \ndeeds, was naturally a personification of the \nanima. The name of the carrier of the Grail, \nin Wolfram von Eschcnbach's version of the \nlegend, is especially significant: Conduir-amour \n(\"guide in love matters\"). She taught the hero \nto differentiate both his feelings and his be­\nhavior toward women. Later, however, this in­\ndividual and personal effort of developing the \nrelationship with the anima was abandoned \nwhen her sublime aspect fused with the figure \nof the Virgin, who then became the object of \nboundless devotion and praise. When the \nanima, as Virgin, was conceived as being all-\npositive, her negative aspects found expression \nin the belief in witches. \nIn China the figure parallel to that of Mary \nis the goddess Kwan-Yin. A more popular \nA connection between the motif of \nfour and the anima appears above in \na painting by the Swiss artist Peter \nBirkhauser A four eyed anima \nappears as an overwhelming, terrifying \nvision The four eyes have a symbolic \nsignificance similar to that of the \n16 pictures in the dream quoted on \np. 183: They allude to the fact that \nthe anima contains the possibility \nof achieving wholeness. \nIn the painting, right, by the \nmodern artist Slavko, the \nSelf is separate from the anima \nbut still merged with nature. The \npainting can be called a \"soul \nlandscape\": On the left sits a \ndark-skinned, naked woman the \nanima. On the right is a bear, the \nanimal soul or instinct Near the \nanima is a double tree— \nsymbolizing the individuation process \nin which the inner opposites unite \nIn the background one at first sees \na glacier, but on looking closely \none sees that it is also a face. \nThis face (from which the life-\nstream flows) is the Self. It has \nfour eyes, and looks something like \nan animal, because it comes from \ninstinctive nature (The painting \nthus provides a good example of \nthe way an unconscious symbol can \ninadvertently find its way into \na fantasy landscape.)\n\f\nChinese anima-figure is the \"Lady of the \nMoon,\" who bestows the gift of poetry or music \non her favorites and can even give them im­\nmortality. In India the same archetype is repre­\nsented by Shakti, Parvati, Rati, and many \nothers; among the Moslems she is chiefly \nFatima, the daughter of Mohammed. \nWorship of the anima as an officially recog­\nnized religious figure brings the serious disad­\nvantage that she loses her individual aspects. \nOn the other hand, if she is regarded as an \nexclusively personal being, there is the danger \nthat, if she is projected into the outer world, it \nis only there that she can be found. This latter \nstate of affairs can create endless trouble, be­\ncause man becomes either the victim of his \nerotic fantasies or compulsively dependent on \none actual woman. \nOnly the painful (but essentially simple) de­\ncision to take one's fantasies and feelings seri­\nously can at this stage prevent a complete stag­\nnation of the inner process of individuation, \nbecause only in this way can a man discover \nwhat this figure means as an inner reality. Thus \nthe anima becomes again what she originally \nwas—the \"woman within,\" who conveys the \nvital messages of the Self. \nMedieval Europe's idea of \"courtly \nlove\" was influenced by the worship \nof the Virgin Mary: Ladies to whom \nknights pledged love were believed \nto be as pure as the Virgin (of \nwhom a typical medieval image was \nthe doll-like carving, top of page, \nc. 1400). On a 15th-century shield, \nfar left, a knight kneels to his \nlady, with death behind him. This \nidealized view of woman produced \nan opposing view: the belief in \nwitches. Left, a 19th-century \npainting of a witches' sabbath. \nWhen the anima is projected on to \nan \"official\" personification, she \ntends to fall apart into a double \naspect, such as Mary and witch \nLeft, another opposing duality \n(from a 1 5th-century manuscript): \npersonifications of the Church \n(on the right, identified with \nMary) and of the Synagogue (here \nidentified with the sinful Eve). \n88"

    "raw_text": "The animus: the man within \nThe male personification of the unconscious in \nwoman —the animus exhibits both good and \nbad aspects, as does the anima in man. But the \nanimus does not so often appear in the form of \nan erotic fantasy or mood; it is more apt to \ntake the form of a hidden \"sacred\" conviction. \nWhen such a conviction is preached with a \nloud, insistent, masculine voice or imposed on \nothers by means of brutal emotional scenes, the \nunderlying masculinity in a woman is easily \nrecognized. However, even in a woman who is \noutwardly very feminine the animus can be an \nequally hard, inexorable power. One may sud­\ndenly find oneself up against something in a \nwoman that is obstinate, cold, and completely \ninaccessible. \nOne ol the favorite themes that the animus \nrepeats endlessly in the ruminations of this kind \nof woman goes like this: \"The only thing in \nthe world that I want is love—and he doesn't \nlove me\"; or \"In this situation there are only \ntwo possibilities and both are equally bad.\" \n(The animus never believes in exceptions.) One \ncan rarely contradict an animus opinion be­\ncause it is usually right in a general way; yet \nit seldom seems to fit the individual situation. \nIt is apt to be an opinion that seems reasonable \nbut beside the point. \nJust as the character of a man's anima is \nshaped by his mother, so the animus is basically \ninfluenced by a woman's father. The father \nendows his daughter's animus with the special \ncoloring of unarguable, incontestably \"true\" \nconvictions convictions that never include the \npersonal reality of the woman herself as she \nactually is. \nThis is why the animus is sometimes, like the \nanima, a demon of death. For example, in a \ngypsy fairy tale a handsome stranger is received \nby a lonely woman in spite of the fact that she \nhas had a dream warning her that he is the \nking of the dead. After he has been with her \nfor a time, she presses him to tell her who he \nreally is. At first he refuses, saying that she will \nAbove, Joan of Arc (played by Ingrld \nBergman in the 1948 film), whose \nanimus —  the male side of the female \npsyche—took the form of a \"sacred \nconviction \" Right, two images of \nthe negative animus: a 16th-century \npainting of a woman dancing with \ndeath; and (from a manuscript c \n1500) Hades with Persephone, whom \nhe abducted to the underworld. \n[89\n\f\nHeathchff, the sinister protagonist \nof the British author Emily Bronte's \nnovel,  Wuthenng Heights  (1847), is \npartly a negative, demonic animus \nfigure probably a manifestation of \nEmily Bronte's own animus. In the \nmontage above, Heathcliff (played \nby Laurence Olivier in the 1939 \nfilm) confronts Emily (a portrait \nby her brother); in the background, \nWuthenng Heights as it is today. \nTwo examples of dangerous animus \nfigures: Left, an illustration (by \nthe 19th-century French artist \nGustave Dore) to the folk tale of \nBluebeard Here Bluebeard warns his \nwife against opening a certain door \n(Of course, she does so and finds \nthe corpses of Bluebeard's former \nwives. She is caught, and joins \nher predecessors ) Right, a 19th \ncentury painting of the highwayman \nClaude Duval, who once robbed a \nlady traveler but gave his booty back \non the condition that she dance \nwith him by the roadside \n19\"\n\f\ndie if he tells her. She insists, however, and \nsuddenly he reveals to her that he is death \nhimself. The woman immediately dies of fright. \nViewed mythologically, the beautiful stran­\nger is probably a pagan father-image or god-\nimage, who appears here as king of the dead \ndike Hades' abduction of Persephone). But \npsychologically he represents a particular form \nol the animus that lures women away from all \nhuman relationships and especially from all \ncontacts with real men. He personifies a cocoon \nofdreamy thoughts, filled with desire and judg­\nments about how things \"ought to be,\" which \ncut a woman off from the reality of life. \nThe negative animus does not appear only \nas a death-demon. In myths and fairy tales he \nplays the role of robber and murderer. One \nexample is Bluebeard, who secretly kills all his \nwives in a hidden chamber. In this form the \nanimus personifies all those semiconscious, cold, \ndestructive reflections that invade a woman in \nthe small hours, especially when she has failed \nto realize some obligation of feeling. It is then \nthat she begins to think about the family herit­\nage and matters of that kind—a sort of web of \ncalculating thoughts, filled with malice and in­\ntrigue, which get her into a state where she \neven wishes death to others. (\"When one of us \ndies, I'll move to the Riviera,\" said a woman \nto her husband when she saw the beautiful \nMediterranean coast a thought that was ren­\ndered relatively harmless by reason ol the fact \nthat she said it! I \nBy nursing secret destructive attitudes, a wife \ncan drive her husband, and a mother her chil­\ndren, into illness, accident, or even death. Or \nshe may decide to keep the children from \nmarrying—a deeply hidden form of evil that \nrarely comes to the surface of the mother's con­\nscious mind. (A naive old woman once said to \nme, while showing me a picture of her son, who \nwas drowned when he was 27: \"I prefer it this \nway; it's better than giving him away to an­\nother woman.\") \nA strange passivity and paralysis of all feel­\ning, or a deep insecurity that can lead almost \nto a sense of nullity, may sometimes be the \nresult of an unconscious animus opinion. In the \ndepths of the woman's being, the animus whis­\npers: \"You are hopeless. What's the use of \ntrying? There is no point in doing anything. \nLife will never change for the better.\" \nThe animus is often personified as \na group of men A negative group \nanimus might appear as a dangerous \nband of criminals like the wreckers \n(above, in an 18th-century Italian \npainting) who once lured ships onto \nrocks with lights, killed survivors, \nand looted the wrecks \n•91\n\f\nA frequent personification of the \nnegative group animus in women's \ndreams has been the band of romantic \nbut dangerous outlaws. Above, an \nominous group of bandits from the \n1953 Brazilian film  The Bandit. \nconcerning an adventurous woman \nschoolteacher who falls in love \nwith a bandit leader. \nBelow, an illustration by Fuseli of \nShakespeare's  Midsummer Night's \nDream. The fairy queen has been \ncaused (by magic) to fall in love \nwith a peasant who has been given \nan ass's head, also by magic. This \nis a comic twist on the tales in \nwhich a girl's love releases a man \nfrom a magic spell\n\f\nUnfortunately, whenever one of these per­\nsonifications of the unconscious takes possession \nof our mind, it seems as if we ourselves are hav­\ning such thoughts and feelings. The ego identi­\nfies with them to the point where it is unable \nto detach them and see them for what they are. \nOne is really \"possessed\" by the figure from the \nunconscious. Only after the possession has fallen \naway does one realize with horror that one has \nsaid and done things diametrically opposed to \none's real thoughts and feelings—that one has \nbeen the prey of an alien psychic factor. \nLike the anima, the animus does not merely \nconsist of negative qualities such as brutality, \nrecklessness, empty talk, and silent, obstinate, \nevil ideas. He too has a very positive and valu­\nable side; he too can build a bridge to the Self \nthrough his creative activity. The following \ndream of a woman of 45 may help to illustrate \nthis point: \nTwo veiled figures climb onto the balcony and \ninto the house. They are swathed in black hooded \ncoats, and they seem to want to torment me and \nmy sister. She hides under the bed, but they pull \nher out with a broom and torture her. Then it is \nmy turn. The leader of the two pushes me against \nthe wall, making magical gestures before my face. \nIn the meantime his helper makes a sketch on \nthe wall, and when I see it, I say (in order to \nseem friendly), \"Oh! But this is well drawn!\" \nNow suddenly my tormentor has the noble head \nof an artist, and he says proudly, \"Yes, indeed,\" \nand begins to clean his spectacles. \nAbove left, the singer Franz Grass \nin the title role of Wagner's opera \nThe Flying Dutchman,  based on the \ntale of the sea captain doomed to \nsail a ghost ship until a woman's \nlove breaks the curse on him. \nIn many myths a woman's lover is \na figure of mystery whom she must \nnever try to see. Left, a late 18th -\ncentury engraving of an example \nfrom Greek myth: The maiden Psyche, \nloved by Eros but forbidden to try \nto look at him. Eventually she did \nso and he left her; she was able to \nregain his love only after a long \nsearch and much suffering. \nThe sadistic aspect of these two figures was \nwell known to the dreamer, for in reality she \nfrequently suffered bad attacks of anxiety dur­\ning which she was haunted by the thought that \npeople she loved were in great danger—or even \nthat they were dead. But the fact that the ani­\nmus figure in the dream is double suggests that \nthe burglars personify a psychic factor that is \ndual in its effect, and that could be something \nquite different from these tormenting thoughts. \nThe sister of the dreamer, who runs away from \nthe men, is caught and tortured. In reality this \nsister died when fairly young. She had been \nartistically gifted, but had made very little use \nof her talent. Next the dream reveals that the \nveiled burglars are actually disguised artists, \nand that if the dreamer recognizes their gifts \n(which are her own), they will give up their evil \nintentions. \nWhat is the deeper meaning of the dream? \nIt is that behind the spasms of anxiety there is \nindeed a genuine and mortal danger; but there \nis also a creative possibility for the dreamer. \nShe, like the sister, had some talent as a painter, \nbut she doubted whether painting could be a \nmeaningful activity for her. Now her dream \ntells her in the most earnest way that she must \nlive out this talent. If she obeys, the destruc­\ntive, tormenting animus will be transformed \ninto a creative and meaningful activity. \nAs in this dream, the animus often appears \nas a group of men. In this way the unconscious \nsymbolizes the fact that the animus represents \na collective rather than a personal element. \nBecause of this collective-mindedness women \nhabitually refer (when their animus is speaking \nthrough them) to \"one\" or \"they\" or \"every­\nbody,\" and in such circumstances their speech \nfrequently contains the words \"always\" and \n\"should\" and \"ought.\" \nA vast number of myths and fairy tales tell of \na prince, turned by witchcraft into a wild ani­\nmal or monster, who is redeemed by the love \nof a girl — a process symbolizing the manner in \nwhich the animus becomes conscious. (Dr. Hen­\nderson has commented on the significance of \nthis \"Beauty and the Beast\" motif in the pre­\nceding chapter.) Very often the heroine is not \n193\n\f\nallowed to ask questions about her mysterious, \nunknown lover and husband; or she meets him \nonly in the dark and may never look at him. \nThe implication is that, by blindly trusting and \nloving him, she will be able to redeem her \nbridegroom. But this never succeeds. She \nalways breaks her promise and finally finds her \nlover again only after a long, difficult quest and \nmuch suffering. \nThe parallel in life is that the conscious atten­\ntion a woman has to give to her animus prob­\nlem takes much time and involves a lot of suf­\nfering. But if she realizes who and what her \nanimus is and what he does to her, and if she \nfaces these realities instead of allowing herself \nto be possessed, her animus can turn into an \ninvaluable inner companion who endows her \nwith the masculine qualities of initiative, cour­\nage, objectivity, and spiritual wisdom. \nThe animus, just like the anima, exhibits four \nstages of development. He first appears as a \npersonification of mere physical power—for \ninstance, as an athletic champion or \"muscle \nman.\" In the next stage he possesses initiative \nand the capacity for planned action. In the \nthird phase, the animus becomes the \"word,\" \noften appearing as a professor or clergyman. \nFinally, in his fourth manifestation, the animus \nis the incarnation of meaning. On this highest \nlevel he becomes (like the anima) a mediator \nof the religious experience whereby life acquires \nnew meaning. He gives the woman spiritual \nfirmness, an invisible inner support that com­\npensates for her outer softness. The animus in \nhis most developed form sometimes connects \nthe woman's mind with the spiritual evolution \nEmbodiments of the four stages \nof the animus: First, the wholly \nphysical man — the fictional \nlungle heroTarzan (top, played by \nJohnny Weismuller). Second, the \n\"romantic\" man— the 19th century \nBritish poet Shelley (center left): \nor the \"man of action\"—America's \nErnest Hemingway, war hero, hunter, \netc. Third, the bearer of the \"word\" \n— Lloyd George, the great political \norator Fourth, the wise guide to \nspiritual truth—often projected \non to Gandhi (left). \nAbove right, an Indian miniature \nof a girl gazing with love at a \nman's portrait. A woman falling \nin love with a picture (ora film \nstar) is clearly projecting her \nanimus onto the man. The actor \nRudolph Valentino (right, in a \nfilm made in 1 922) became the \nfocus of animus projection for \nthousands of women while he \nlived—and even after he died \nFar right, part of the immense floral \ntribute sent by women all over the \nworld to Valentino's funeral in 1 926 \nI'M\n\f\nof her age, and can thereby make her even \nmore receptive than a man to new creative \nideas. It is for this reason that in earlier times \nwomen were used by many nations as diviners \nand seers. The creative boldness of their posi­\ntive animus at times expresses thoughts and \nideas that stimulate men to new enterprises. \nThe \"inner man\" within a woman's psyche \ncan lead to marital troubles similar to those \nmentioned in the section on the anima. What \nmakes things especially complicated is the fact \nthat the possession of one partner by the animus \n(or anima) may automatically exert such an \nirritating effect upon the other that he (or she) \nbecomes possessed too. Animus and anima \nalways tend to drag conversation down to a \nvery low level and to produce a disagreeable, \nirascible, emotional atmosphere. \nAs I mentioned before, the positive side of \nthe animus can personify an enterprising spirit, \ncourage, truthfulness, and in the highest form, \nspiritual profundity. Through him a woman \ncan experience the underlying processes of her \ncultural and personal objective situation, and \ncan find her way to an intensified spiritual atti­\ntude to life. This naturally presupposes that her \nanimus ceases to represent opinions that are \nabove criticism. The woman must find the \ncourage and inner broadmindedness to question \nthe sacredness of her own convictions. Only \nthen will she be able to take in the suggestions \nof the unconscious, especially when they con­\ntradict her animus opinions. Only then will the \nmanifestations of the Self get through to her, \nand will she be able consciously to understand \ntheir meaning.\n\f\nThe Self: symbols of totality \nIf an individual has wrestled seriously enough \nand long enough with the anima (or animus) \nproblem so that he, or she, is no longer partially \nidentified with it, the unconscious again changes \nits dominant character and appears in a new \nsymbolic form, representing the Self, the inner­\nmost nucleus of the psyche. In the dreams of a \nwoman this center is usually personified as a \nsuperior female figure—a priestess, sorceress, \nearth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In \nthe case of a man, it manifests itself as a mas­\nculine initiator and guardian (an Indian guru), \na wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth. \nTwo folk tales illustrate the role that such a \nfigure can play. The first is an Austrian tale: \nA king has ordered soldiers to keep the night \nwatch beside the corpse of a black princess, who \nhas been bewitched. Every midnight she rises and \nkills the guard. At last one soldier, whose turn it \nis to stand guard, despairs and runs away into \nthe woods. There he meets an \"old guitarist who \nis our Lord Himself.\" This old musician tells him \nwhere to hide in the church and instructs him \non how to behave so that the black princess can­\nnot get him. With this divine help the soldier \nactually manages to redeem the princess and \nmarry her. \nClearly, \"the old guitarist who is our Lord \nHimself\" is, in psychological terms, a symbolic \npersonification of the Self. With his help the \nego avoids destruction and is able to overcome \n— and even redeem — a highly dangerous aspect \nof his anima. \nIn a woman's psyche, as I have said, the Self \nassumes feminine personifications. This is illus­\ntrated in the second story, an Eskimo tale: \nA lonely girl who has been disappointed in love \nmeets a wizard traveling in a copper boat. He is \nthe \"Spirit of the Moon,\" who has given all the \nanimals to mankind and who also bestows luck in \nhunting. He abducts the girl to the heavenly \nrealm. Once, when the Spirit of the Moon has \nleft her, she visits a little house near the Moon \nGhost's mansion. There she finds a tiny woman \nclothed in the \"intestinal membrane of the \nbearded seal,\" who warns the heroine against the \nSpirit of the Moon, saying that he plans to kill \nher. (It appears that he is a killer of women, a \nsort of Bluebeard.) The tiny woman fashions a \nlong rope by means of which the girl can descend \nto earth at the time of the new moon, which is \nthe moment when the little woman can weaken \nthe Moon Spirit. The girl climbs down, but when \nshe arrives on earth, she does not open her eyes \nas quickly as the little woman told her to. Because \nof this, she is turned into a spider and can never \nbecome human again. \nAs we have noted, the divine musician in the \nfirst tale is a representation of the \"wise old \nman,\" a typical personification of the Self. He \nis akin to the sorcerer Merlin of medieval \nlegend or to the Greek god Hermes. The little \nwoman in her strange membrane-clothing is a \nparallel figure, symbolizing the Self as it \nappears in the feminine psyche. The old musi­\ncian saves the hero from the destructive anima, \nand the little woman protects the girl against \nthe Eskimo \"Bluebeard\" (who is, in the form of \nthe Moon Spirit, her animus). In this case, how­\never, things go wrong—a point that I shall take \nup later. \nThe Self, however, does not always take the \nform of a wise old man or wise old woman. \nThese paradoxical personifications are attempts \nto express something that is not entirely con­\ntained in time—something simultaneously \nyoung and old. The dream of a middle-aged \nman shows the Self appearing as a young man: \nComing from the street, a youth rode down \ninto our garden. (There were no bushes and no \nfence as there are in real life, and the garden lay \nopen.) I did not quite know if he came on pur­\npose, or if the horse carried him here against \nhis will. \nI stood on the path that leads to my studio and \nwatched the arrival with great pleasure. The sight \ni g6\n\f\nThe Self— the inner center of the \ntotal psyche — is often personified \nin dreams as a superior human \nfigure To women, the Self might \nappear as a wise and powerful \ngoddess —like the ancient Greek \nmother goddess Demeter (right, \nshown with her son Triptolemus \nand daughter Kore. in a fifth -\ncentury-B.c. relief). The \"fairy \ngodmother\" of many tales is also \na symbolic personification of the \nfemale Self: above. Cinderella's \ngodmother (from an illustration \nby Gustave Dore). Below, a helpful \nold woman (also a fairy godmother) \nrescues a girl in an illustration of a \nHans Christian Andersen tale \n1(>7\n\f\nPersonifications of the Self in \nmen's dreams often take the form \nof \"wise old men.\" Far left, the \nmagician Merlin of the Arthurian \nlegends (in a 14th-century English \nmanuscript) Center, a  guru \n(wise man) from an 18th-century \nIndian painting.

Before the \nboy's hands hovers a flower—as if \nhe need only raise his hands and a \nmagical flower will appear. He is \nblack because of his nocturnal (i.e. \nunconscious) origin. \nof the boy on his beautiful horse impressed me \ndeeply. \nThe horse was a small, wild, powerful animal, \na symbol of energy (it resembled a boar), and it \nhad a thick, bristly, silvery-gray coat. The boy \nrode past me between the studio and house, \njumped off his horse, and led him carefully away \nso that he would not trample on the flower bed \nwith its beautiful red and orange tulips. The \nflower bed had been newly made and planted by \nmy wife fa dream occurrence). \nThis youth signifies the Self, and with it re­\nnewal of life, a creative elan vital, and a new \nspiritual orientation by means of which every­\nthing becomes full of life and enterprise. \nIf a man devotes himself to the instructions \nof his own unconscious, it can bestow this gift, \nso that suddenly life, which has been stale and \ndull, turns into a rich, unending inner adven­\nture, full of creative possibilities. In a woman's \npsychology, this same youthful personification \nof the Self can appear as a supernaturally gifted \ngirl. The dreamer in this instance is a woman \nin her late forties: \nI stood in front of a church and was washing \nthe pavement with water. Then I ran down the \nstreet just at the moment when the students from \nthe high school were let out. I came to a stagnant \nriver across which a board or tree trunk had been \nlaid; but when I was attempting to walk across, \na mischievous student bounced on the board so \nthat it cracked and I nearly fell into the water. \n\"Idiot!\" I yelled out. On the other side of the \nriver three little girls were playing, and one of \nthem stretched out her hand as if to help me. I \nthought that her small hand was not strong \nenough to help me, but when I took it, she suc­\nceeded, without the slightest effort, in pulling me \nacross and up the bank on the other side. \nThe dreamer is a religious person, but \naccording to her dream she cannot remain in \nthe Church (Protestant) any longer; in fact, she \nseems to have lost the possibility of entering it, \nalthough she tries to keep the access to it as \nclean as she can. According to the dream, she \nmust now cross a stagnant river, and this indi­\ncates that the flow of life is slowed down \nbecause of the unresolved religious problem. \n(Crossing a river is a frequent symbolic image \nfor a fundamental change of attitude.) The \nstudent was interpreted by the dreamer herself \nas the personification of a thought that she had \npreviously had — namely, that she might satisfy \nher spiritual yearning by attending high school. \nObviously the dream does not think much of \nthis plan. When she dares to cross the river \nalone, a personification of the Self (the girl), \nsmall but supernaturally powerful, helps her. \nBut the form of a human being, whether \nyouthful or old, is only one of the many ways \nin which the Self can appear in dreams or \nvisions. The various ages it assumes show not \nonly that it is with us throughout the whole of \nlife, but also that it exists beyond the con-\n199\n\f\nsciously realized flow of life — which is what \ncreates our experience of time. \nJust as the Self is not entirely contained in \nour conscious experience of time (in our space-\ntime dimension), it is also simultaneously omni­\npresent. Moreover, it appears frequently in a \nform that hints at a special omnipresence; that \nis, it manifests itself as a gigantic, symbolic \nhuman being who embraces and contains the \nwhole cosmos. When this image turns up in the \ndreams of an individual, we may hope for a \ncreative solution to his conflict, because now \nthe vital psychic center is activated (i.e. the \nwhole being is condensed into oneness) in order \nto overcome the difficulty. \nIt is no wonder that this figure of the Cosmic \nMan appears in many myths and religious \nteachings. Generally he is described as some­\nthing helpful and positive. He appears as \nAdam, as the Persian Gayomart, or as the \nHindu Purusha. This figure may even be de­\nscribed as the basic principle of the whole world. \nThe ancient Chinese, for instance, thought that \nbefore anything whatever was created, there \nwas a colossal divine man called P'an Ku who \ngave heaven and earth their form. When he \ncried, his tears made the Yellow River and the \nYangtze River; when he breathed, the wind \nrose; when he spoke, thunder was loosed; and \nwhen he looked around, lightning flashed. If he \nwas in a good mood, the weather was fine; if \nhe was sad, it clouded over. When he died, he \nfell apart, and from his body the five holy \nmountains of China sprang into existence. His \nhead became the T'ai mountain in the East, \nhis trunk became the Sung mountain in the cen­\nter, his right arm the Heng mountain in the \nNorth, his left arm the Heng mountain in the \nSouth, and his feet the Hua mountain in the \nWest. His eyes became the sun and moon. \nWe have already seen that symbolic struc­\ntures that seem to refer to the process of indi­\nviduation tend to be based on the motif of the \nnumber four such as the four functions of \nconsciousness, or the four stages of the anima \nor animus. It reappears here in the cosmic \nshape of P'an Ku. Only under specific circum­\nstances do other combinations of numbers \nappear in the psychic material. The natural un­\nhampered manifestations of the center are \ncharacterized by fourfoldness- that is to say, by \nhaving four divisions, or some other structure \nderiving from the numerical series of 4, 8, 16, \nand so on. Number 16 plays a particularly im­\nportant role, since it is composed of four fours. \nIn our Western civilization, similar ideas of \na Cosmic Man have attached themselves to the \nsymbol of Adam, the First Man. There is a \nJewish legend that when God created Adam, \nhe first gathered red, black, white, and yellow \ndust from the four corners of the world, and \nthus Adam \"reached from one end of the world \nto the other.\" When he bent down, his head \nwas in the East and his feet in the West. \nAccording to another Jewish tradition, the \nwhole of mankind was contained in Adam from \nthe beginning, which meant the soul of every­\nbody who would ever be born. The soul of \nAdam, therefore, was \"like the wick of a lamp \ncomposed of innumerable strands.\" In this \nsymbol the idea of a total oneness of all human \nexistence, beyond all individual units, is clearly \nexpressed. \nIn ancient Persia, the same original First \nMan called Gayomart — was depicted as a \nhuge figure emitting light. When he died, every \nkind of metal sprang from his body, and from \nhis soul came gold. His semen fell upon the \nearth, and from it came the first human couple \nin the form of two rhubarb shrubs. It is striking \n200 \nMany people today personify the \nSelf in their dreams as prominent \npublic figures Jungian psychologists \nfind that, in men's dreams. \nDr. Albert Schweitzer (far left) and \nSir Winston Churchill (left) \noften appear; in women's dreams, \nEleanor Roosevelt (right) and \nQueen Elizabeth II (far right, a \nportrait on an African house).\n\f\nCosmic Man the gigantic, all-\nembracing figure that personifies and \ncontains the entire universe—is a \ncommon representation of the Self in \nmyths and dreams. Left, the title page \nof Leviathan,  by the 17th-century \nEnglish philosopher Thomas Hobbes. \nThe gigantic figure of Leviathan \nis made up of all the people of the \n\"commonwealth\" — Hobbes's ideal \nsociety, in which the people choose \ntheir own central authority (or \n\"sovereign,\" hence Leviathan's \ncrown, sword, and scepter). Above, \nthe cosmic figure of ancient \nChina's Pan Ku — shown covered in \nleaves to indicate that Cosmic Man \n(or First Man) simply existed, like \na plant, grown in nature. Below, \non a leaf from an 18th-century \nIndian illuminated manuscript, the \nCosmic Lion Goddess holding the \nsun (the lion is made up of many \npeople and animals) \n201\n\f\nthat the Chinese P'an Ku was also depicted \ncovered by leaves like a plant. Perhaps this is \nbecause the First Man was thought of as a self-\ngrown, living unit that just existed without any \nanimal impulse or self-will. Among a group of \npeople who live on the banks of the Tigris. \nAdam is still, at the present time, worshiped as \nthe hidden \"super-soul\" or mystical \"protective \nspirit\" of the entire human race. These people \nsay that he came from a date palm another \nrepetition of the plant motif. \nIn the East, and in some gnostic circles in the \nWest, people soon recognized that the Cosmic \nMan was more an inner psychic image than a \nconcrete outer reality. According to Hindu \ntradition, for instance, he is something that lives \nwithin the individual human being and is the \nonly part that is immortal. This inner Great \nMan redeems the individual by leading him \nout of creation and its sufferings, back into his \noriginal eternal sphere. But he can do this only \nif man recognizes him and rises from his sleep \nin order to be led. In the symbolic myths of \nold India, this figure is known as the Purusha, \na name that simply means \"man\" or \"per­\nson.\" The Purusha lives within the heart of \nevery individual, and yet at the same time he \nfills the entire cosmos. \nAccording to the testimony of many myths, \nthe Cosmic Man is not only the beginning but \nalso the final goal of all life of the whole of \ncreation. \"All cereal nature means wheat, all \ntreasure nature means gold, all generation \nmeans man,\" says the medieval sage Meister \nEckhart. And if one looks at this from a psy­\nchological standpoint, it is certainly so. The \nwhole inner psychic reality of each individual \nis ultimately oriented toward this archetypal \nsymbol of the Self. \nIn practical terms this means that the exist­\nence of human beings will never be satisfactorily \nexplained in terms of isolated instincts or pur­\nposive mechanism such as hunger, power, sex, \nsurvival, perpetuation of the species, and so on. \nThat is, man's main purpose is not to eat, drink, \netc., but lo be human. Above and beyond these \ndrives, our inner psychic reality serves to mani­\nfest a living mystery that can be expressed only \nby a symbol, and for its expression the uncon­\nscious often chooses the powerful image of the \nCosmic Man. \nIn our Western civilization the Cosmic Man \nhas been identified to a great extent with Christ, \nand in the East with Krishna or with Buddha. \nIn the Old Testament this same symbolic figure \nturns up as the \"Son of Man\" and in later \nJewish mysticism is called Adam Kadmon. \nCertain religious movements of late antiquity \nsimply called him Anthropos (the Greek word \nfor man). Like all symbols this image points to \n202 \nTop left, a Rhodesian rock painting \nof a creation myth, in which the \nFirst Man (the moon) mates with \nthe morning star and evening star \nto produce the creatures of earth. \nCosmic Man often appears as an \nAdam-like original man—and Christ, \ntoo, has become identified with \nthis personification of the Self: \nTop right, a painting by the 15th-\ncentury German artist Grunewald \nshows the figure of Christ with \nall the majesty of Cosmic Man\n\f\nan unknowable secret — to the ultimate un­\nknown meaning of human existence. \nAs we have noted, certain traditions assert \nthat the Cosmic Man is the goal of creation, \nbut the achievement of this should not be under­\nstood as a possible external happening. From \nthe point of view of the Hindu, for example, it \nis not so much that the external world will one \nday dissolve into the original Great Man, but \nthat the ego's extraverted orientation toward \nthe external world will disappear in order to \nmake way for the Cosmic Man. This happens \nwhen the ego merges into the Self. The ego's \ndiscursive flow of representations (which goes \nfrom one thought to another) and its desires \n(which run from one object to another) calm \ndown when the Great Man within is encount­\nered. Indeed, we must never forget that for us \nouter reality exists only in so far as we perceive \nit consciously, and that we cannot prove that \nit exists \"in and by itself.\" \nThe many examples coming from various \ncivilizations and different periods show the uni-\nExamples of the \"royal couple\" (a \nsymbolic image of psychic totality \nand the Self): left, a third-century \nAD.

In \na letter to the owner Jung added \nthat the head \"has, like his analogs \nAdonis, Tammuz, and .. Baldur, all \nthe grace and charm of either sex.\" \n203\n\f\nRight, a pre-Roman sculpture of the \nCeltic bear goddess Artio, found \nat Berne (which means \"bear\"). \nShe was probably a mother goddess, \nresembling the she-bear in the \ndream quoted on this page.

His \nimage is present in the minds of men as a sort \nof goal or expression of the basic mystery of \nour life. Because this symbol represents that \nwhich is whole and complete, it is often con­\nceived of as a bisexual being. In this form the \nsymbol reconciles one of the most important \npairs of psychological opposites — male and \nfemale. This union also appears frequently in \ndreams as a divine, royal, or otherwise distin­\nguished couple. The following dream of a man \nof 47 shows this aspect of the Self in a dra­\nmatic way: \nI am on a platform, and below me I see a huge, \nblack, beautiful she-bear with a rough but well-\ngroomed coat. She is standing on her hind legs, \nand on a stone slab she is polishing a flat oval \nblack stone, which becomes increasingly shiny. \nNot far away a lioness and her cub do the same \nthing, but the stones they are polishing are bigger \nand round in shape. After a while the she-bear \nturns into a fat, naked woman with black hair \nand dark, fiery eyes. I behave in an erotically pro­\nvocative way toward her, and suddenly she moves \nnearer in order to catch me. I get frightened and \ntake refuge up on the building of scaffolding \nwhere I was before. Later I am in the midst of \nmany women, half of whom are primitive and \nhave rich black hair (as if they arc transformed \nfrom animals); the other half are our women [of \nthe same nationality as the dreamer] and have \nblonde or brown hair. The primitive women sing \na very sentimental song in melancholy, high-\npitched voices. Now, in a high elegant carriage, \nthere comes a young man who wears on his head \na royal golden crown, set with shining rubies-\n204\n\f\na very beautiful sight. Beside him sits a blonde \nyoung woman, probably his wife, but without a \ncrown. It seems that the lioness and her cub have \nbeen transformed into this couple. They belong \nto the group of primitives. Now all the women \n(the primitives and the others) intone a solemn \nsong, and the royal carriage slowly travels toward \nthe horizon. \nHere the inner nucleus of the dreamer's \npsyche shows itself at first in a temporary vision \nof the royal couple, which emerges from the \ndepths of his animal nature and the primitive \nlayer of his unconscious. The she-bear in the \nbeginning is a sort of mother goddess. (Artemis, \nfor instance, was worshiped in Greece as a she-\nbear. ) The dark oval stone that she rubs and \npolishes probably symbolizes the dreamer's in­\nnermost being, his true personality. Rubbing \nand polishing stones is a well-known, exceed­\ningly ancient activity of man. In Europe \"holy\" \nstones, wrapped in bark and hidden in caves, \nhave been found in main places; as containers \nof divine powers they were probably kept there \nby men of the Stone Age. At the present time \nsome of the Australian aborigines believe that \ntheir dead ancestors continue to exist in stones \nas virtuous and divine powers, and that if they \nrub these stones, the power increases (like \ncharging them with electricity) for the benefit \nof both the living and the dead. \nThe man who had the dream wc are discus­\nsing had hitherto refused to accept a marital \nbond with a woman. His fear of being caught \nby this aspect of life caused him, in the dream, \nto flee from the bear-woman to the spectator's \nplatform where he could passively watch things \nwithout becoming entangled. Through the \nmotif of the stone being rubbed by the bear, the \nunconscious is trying to show him that he should \nlet himself come into contact with this side of \nlife; it is through the frictions of married life \nthat his inner being can be shaped and polished. \nWhen the stone is polished, it will begin to \nshine like a mirror so that the bear can see her­\nself in it; this means that only by accepting \nearthly contact and suffering can the human \nsoul be transformed into a mirror in which the \ndivine powers can perceive themselves. But the \nIn dreams a mirror can symbolize \nthe power of the unconscious to \n\"mirror\" the individual objectively \n—giving him a view of himself that \nhe may never have had before Only \nthrough the unconscious can such a \nview (which often shocks and upsets \nthe conscious mind) be obtained — \njust as in Greek myth the Gorgon \nMedusa, whose look turned men to \nstone, could be gazed upon only in \na mirror. Below, Medusa reflected \nin a shield (a painting by the 17th-\ncentury artist Caravaggio). \ndreamer runs away to a higher place - i.e. into \nall sorts of reflections by which he can escape \nthe demands of life. The dream then shows him \nthat if he runs away from the demands of life, \none part of his soul (his anima) will remain \nundifferentiated, a fact symbolized by the group \nof nondescript women that splits apart into a \nprimitive half and a more civilized one. \nThe lioness and her son, which then appear \non the scene, personify the mysterious urge to­\nward individuation, indicated by their work at \nshaping the round stones. (A round stone is a \nsymbol of the Self.) The lions, a royal couple, \nare in themselves a symbol of totality. In medi­\neval symbolism, the \"philosopher's stone\" (a \n205\n\f\npre-eminent symbol of man's wholeness) is re­\npresented as a pair of lions or as a human \ncouple riding on lions. Symbolically, this points \nto the fact that often the urge toward individu­\nation appears in a veiled form, hidden in the \noverwhelming passion one may feel for another \nperson. (In fact, passion that goes beyond the \nnatural measure of love ultimately aims at the \nmystery of becoming whole, and this is why one \nfeels, when one has fallen passionately in love, \nthat becoming one with the other person is the \nonly worthwhile goal of one's life.) \nAs long as the image of totality in this dream \nexpresses itself in the form of a pair of lions, it \nis still contained in some such overwhelming \npassion. But when lion and lioness have turned \ninto a king and queen, the urge to individuate \nhas reached the level of conscious realization, \nand can now be understood by the ego as being \nthe real goal of life. \nBefore the lions had transformed themselves \ninto human beings, it was only the primitive \nwomen who sang, and they did so in a senti­\nmental manner; that is to say, the feelings of \nthe dreamer remained on a primitive and sen­\ntimental level. But in honor of the humanized \nlions, both the primitive and the civilized \nwomen chant a common hymn of praise. Their \nexpression of their feelings in a united form \nshows that the inner split in the animal has now \nchanged into inner harmony. \nStill another personification of the Self \nappears in a report of a woman's so-called \n\"active imagination.\" (Active imagination is a \ncertain way of meditating imaginatively, by \nOften the Self is represented as a \nhelpful animal (a symbol of the \npsyche's instinctual basis). Top left, \nthe magic fox of Grimm'sfairy tale \n\"The Golden Bird.\" Center, the \nHindu monkey god Hanuman \ncarrying two gods in his heart. \nBottom, Rin Tin Tin the heroic dog \nonce popular in American films and \ntelevision. \nStones are frequent images of the \nSelf (because they are complete— \ni.e. unchanging—and lasting). \nMany people today look for stones \nof special beauty — perhaps on \nbeaches, top right. Some Hindus \npass from father to son stones \n(center) believed to have magical \npowers. \"Precious\" stones, like the \njewels of Queen Elizabeth I (1 558 \n1 603), bottom, are an outward \nsign of wealth and position.\n\f\nwhich one may deliberately enter into contact \nwith the unconscious and make a conscious \nconnection with psychic phenomena. Active \nimagination is among the most important of \nJung's discoveries. While it is in a sense com­\nparable to Eastern forms of meditation, such as \nthe technique of Zen Buddhism or of Tantric \nYoga, or to Western techniques like those of \nthe Jesuit Exercitia, it is fundamentally differ­\nent in that the meditator remains completely \ndevoid of any conscious goal or program. Thus \nthe meditation becomes the solitary experiment \nof a free individual, which is the reverse of a \nguided attempt to master the unconscious. This, \nhowever, is not the place to enter into a de­\ntailed analysis of active imagination; the reader \nwill find one of Jung's descriptions of it in his \npaper on \"The Transcendent Function.\") \nIn the woman's meditation the Self appeared \nas a deer, which said to the ego: \"I am your \nchild and your mother. They call me the 'con­\nnecting animal' because I connect people, ani­\nmals, and even stones with one another if I enter \nthem. I am your fate or the 'objective I.' When \nI appear, I redeem you from the meaningless \nhazards of life. The fire burning inside me burns \nin the whole of nature. If a man loses it, he \nbecomes egocentric, lonely, disoriented, and \nweak.\" \nThe Self is often symbolized as an animal, \nrepresenting our instinctive nature and its con­\nnectedness with one's surroundings. (That is \nwhy there are so many helpful animals in \nmyths and fairy tales.) This relation of the Self \nto all surrounding nature and even the cosmos \nprobably comes from the fact that the \"nuclear \natom\" of our psyche is somehow woven into \nthe whole world, both outer and inner. All the \nhigher manifestations of life are somehow tuned \nto the surrounding space-time continuum. \nAnimals, for example, have their own special \nfoods, their particular home-building materials, \nand their definite territories, to all of which \ntheir instinctive patterns are exactly tuned and \nadapted. Time rhythms also play their part: \nWe have only to think of the fact that most \ngrass-eating animals have their young at pre­\ncisely the time of year when the grass is richest \n207"

With such considerations \nin mind, a well-known zoologist has said that \nthe \"inwardness\" of each animal reaches far \nout into the world around it and \"psychifies\" \ntime and space. \nIn ways that are still completely beyond our \ncomprehension, our unconscious is similarly \nattuned to our surroundings to our group, to \nsociety in general, and, beyond these, to the \nspace-time continuum and the whole of nature. \nThus the Great Man of the Naskapi Indians \ndoes not merely reveal inner truths; he also \ngives hints about where and when to hunt. And \nso from dreams the Naskapi hunter evolves the \nwords and melodies of the magical songs with \nwhich he attracts the animals. \nBut this specific help from the unconscious \nis not given to primitive man alone. Jung dis­\ncovered that dreams can also give civilized man \nthe guidance he needs in finding his way \nthrough the problems of both his inner and his \nouter life. Indeed, many ol our dreams are con­\ncerned with details of our outer life and our \nsurroundings. Such things as the tree in front \nof the window, one's bicycle or car, or a stone \npicked up during a walk may be raised to the \nlevel of symbolism through our dream life and \nbecome meaningful. If we pay attention to our \ndreams, instead of living in a cold, impersonal \nworld of meaningless chance, we may begin to \nemerge into a world of our own, full of impor­\ntant and secretly ordered events. \nOur dreams, however, are not as a ride \nprimarily concerned with our adaptation to \nouter life. In our civilized world, most dreams \nhave to do with the development (by the ego) \nof the \"right\" inner attitude toward the Self, \nfor this relationship is far more disturbed in us \nby modern ways of thinking and behaving than \nis the case with primitive people. They gen­\nerally live directly from the inner center, but \nwe, with our uprooted consciousness, are so \nentangled with external, completely foreign \nmatters that it is very difficult for the messages \nof the Self to get through to us.

In many \ndreams the nuclear center, the Self, also appears \nas a crystal. The mathematically precise \narrangement of a crystal evokes in us the intui­\ntive feeling that even in so-called \"dead\" mat­\nter there is a spiritual ordering principle at \nwork. Thus the crystal often symbolically stands \nfor the union of extreme opposites —of matter \nand spirit. \nPerhaps crystals and stones are especially apt \nsymbols of the Self because of the \"just-so-ness\" \nof their nature. Many people cannot refrain \nfrom picking up stones of a slightly unusual \ncolor or shape and keeping them, without know­\ning why they do this. It is as if the stones held \na living mystery that fascinates them. Men have \ncollected stones since the beginning of time and \nhave apparently assumed that certain ones were \nthe containers of the life-force with all its mys­\ntery. The ancient Germans, for instance, be­\nlieved that the spirits of the dead continued to \nlive in their tombstones. The custom of placing \nstones on graves may spring partly from the \nsymbolic idea that something eternal of the dead \nperson remains, which can be most fittingly \nrepresented by a stone, for while the human \nbeing is as different as possible from a stone, yet \nman's innermost center is in a strange and \nspecial way akin to it (perhaps because the stone \nsymbolizes mere existence at the farthest remove \nfrom the emotions, feelings, fantasies, and \ndiscursive thinking of ego-consciousnessi. In \nthis sense the stone symbolizes what is perhaps \nthe simplest and deepest experience —the ex­\nperience of something eternal that man can \nhave in those moments when he feels immortal \nand unalterable. \nThe urge that we find in practically all civili­\nzations to erect stone monuments to famous \nmen or on the site of important events probably \nalso stems from this symbolic meaning of the \nstone. The stone that Jacob placed on the spot \nwhere he had his famous dream, or certain \nstones left by simple people on the tombs of \nlocal saints or heroes, show the original nature \nof the human urge to express an otherwise inex­\npressible experience by the stone-symbol. It is \nno wonder that many religious cults use a stone \nto signify God or to mark a place of worship. \nThe holiest sanctuary of the Islamic world is the\n\f\nKa'aba, the black stone in Mecca to which all \npious Moslems hope to make their pilgrimage. \nAccording to Christian ecclesiastical sym­\nbolism, Christ is \"the stone which the builders \nrejected,\" which became \"the head of the cor­\nner\" (Luke xx: 17). Alternatively he is called \nthe \"spiritual rock\" from which the water of \nlife springs (1 Cor. x: 4). Medieval alchemis.ts, \nwho searched for the secret of matter in a pre-\nscientific way, hoping to find God in it, or \nat least the working of divine activity, believed \nthat this secret was embodied in their famous \n\"philosopher's stone.\" But some of the alche­\nmists dimly perceived that their much-sought-\nafter stone was a symbol of something that can \nbe found only within the psyche of man. An \nold Arabian alchemist, Morienus, said: \"This \nthing [the philosopher's stone] is extracted from \nyou: you are its mineral, and one can find it \nin you; or, to put it more clearly, they [the \nalchemists] take it from you. If you recognize \nthis, the love and approbation of the stone will \ngrow within you. Know that this is true with­\nout doubt.\" \nThe alchemical stone (the lapis) symbolizes \nsomething that can never be lost or dissolved, \nsomething eternal that some alchemists com­\npared to the mystical experience of God within \none's own soul. It usually takes prolonged \nsuffering to burn away all the superfluous \npsychic elements concealing the stone. But some \nprofound inner experience of the Self does occur \nto most people at least once in a lifetime. From \nthe psychological standpoint, a genuinely reli­\ngious attitude consists of an effort to discover \nthis unique experience, and gradually to keep \nin tune with it (it is relevant that a stone is \nitself something permanent), so that the Self be­\ncomes an inner partner toward whom c /ie's \nattention is continually turned. \nThe fact that this highest and most frequent \nsymbol of the Self is an object of lifeless mat­\nter points to yet another field of inquiry and \nspeculation: that is, the still unknown relation­\nship between what we call the unconscious \npsyche and what we call \"matter\" — a mystery \nwith which psychosomatic medicine endeavors \nto grapple. In studying this still undefined and \nLeft, the Black Stone of Mecca, \nblessed by Mohammed (in an Arabic \nmanuscript illustration) to integrate \nit into the Islamic religion. It is \ncarried by four tribal chieftains \n(at the four corners of a carpet) \ninto the Ka'aba, the holy sanctuary \nto which thousands of Moslems make \nan annual pilgrimage (below left). \nRight, another symbolic stone: \nthe Stone of Scone (or Stone of \nDestiny) on which Scottish kings \nwere formerly crowned. It was taken \nto England's Westminster Abbey in \nthe 1 3th century, but it never lost \nits importance for Scotland On \nChristmas Day, 1 950, a group of \nScottish Nationalists stole the \nStone from the Abbey and took it \nback to Scotland (It was returned \nto the Abbey in April 1951.) \nRight, a tourist kisses the famous \n\"Blarney Stone'' of Irish legend. It \nis supposed to confer the gift of \neloquence on those who kiss it\n\f\nunexplained connection (it may prove to be that \n\"psyche\" and \"matter\" are actually the same \nphenomenon, one observed from \"within\" and \nthe other from \"without\"), Dr. Jung put for­\nward a new concept that he called synchroni-\ncily. This term means a \"meaningful coinci­\ndence\" of outer and inner events that are not \nthemselves causally connected. The emphasis \nlies on the word \"meaningful.\" \nIf an aircraft crashes before my eyes as I am \nblowing my nose, this is a coincidence of events \nthat has no meaning. It is simply a chance \noccurrence of a kind that happens all the time. \nBut if I bought a blue frock and, by mistake, \nthe shop delivered a black one on the day one \nof my near relatives died, this would be a \nmeaningful coincidence. The two events are not \ncausally related, but they are connected by the \nsymbolic meaning that our society gives to the \ncolor black. \nWherever Dr. Jung observed such meaningful \ncoincidences in an individual's life, it seemed (as \nthe individual's dreams revealed) that there \nwas an archetype activated in the unconscious \nof the individual concerned. To illustrate this by \nmy example of the black frock: In such a case \nthe person who receives the black frock might \nalso have had a dream on the theme of death. \nIt seems as if the underlying archetype is mani­\nfesting itself simultaneously in inner and exter­\nnal events. The common denominator is a \nsymbolically expressed message — in this case a \nmessage about death. \nAs soon as we notice that certain types of \nevent \"like\" to cluster together at certain times, \nwe begin to understand the attitude of the \nChinese, whose theories of medicine, philoso­\nphy, and even building are based on a \"science\" \nof meaningful coincidences. The classical Chi­\nnese texts did not ask what causes what, but \nrather what \"likes\" to occur with what. One can \nA painting by the modern artist \nHans Haffenrichter resembles the \npattern of a crystal — like ordinary \nstone, a symbol of wholeness. \nsee much the same underlying theme in astro­\nlogy, and in the way various civilizations have \ndepended on consulting oracles and paying at­\ntention to omens. All of these are attempts to \nprovide an explanation of coincidence that is \ndifferent from one that depends on straightfor­\nward cause and effect. \nIn creating the concept of synchronicity, Dr. \nJung sketched a way in which we might pene­\ntrate deeper into the inter-relation of psyche \nand matter. And it is precisely toward such a \nrelation that the symbol of the stone seems to \npoint. But this is still a completely open and \ninsufficiently explored matter, with which \nfuture generations of psychologists and physi­\ncists must deal. \nIt may seem that my discussion of synchroni­\ncity has led me away from my main theme, but \nI feel it is necessary to make at least a brief \nintroductory reference to it because it is a \nJungian hypothesis that seems to be pregnant \nwith future possibilities of investigation and \napplication. Synchronistic events, moreover, \nalmostinvariably accompany thecrucial phases \nof the process of individuation. But too often \nthey pass unnoticed, because the individual has \nnot learned to watch for such coincidences and \nto make them meaningful in relation to the \nsymbolism of his dreams. \n2 I I\n\f\nThe relation to the Self \nNowadays more and more people, especially \nthose who live in large cities, suffer from a ter­\nrible emptiness and boredom, as if they were \nwaiting for something that never arrives. Movies \nand television, spectator sports and political \nexcitements may divert them for a while, but \nagain and again, exhausted and disenchanted, \nthey have to return to the wasteland of their \nown lives. \nThe only adventure that is still worthwhile \nfor modern man lies in the inner realm of the \nunconscious psyche. With this idea vaguely in \nmind, many now turn to Yoga and other \nEastern practices. But these offer no genuine \nnew adventure, for in them one only takes over \nwhat is already known to the Hindus or the \nChinese without directly meeting one's own \ninner life center. While it is true that Eastern \nmethods serve to concentrate the mind and \ndirect it inward (and that this procedure is in \na sense similar to the introversion of an analy­\ntical,treat ment), there is a very important differ­\nence. Jung evolved a way of getting-to one's \ninner center and making contact with the living \nmystery of the unconscious, alone and unaided. \nThat is utterly different from following a well-\nworn path. \nTrying to give the living reality of the Self \na constant amount of daily attention is like \ntrying to live simultaneously on two levels or in \ntwo different worlds. One gives one's mind, as \nbefore, to outer duties, but at the same time \none remains alert for hints and signs, both in \ndreams and in external events, that the Self \nuses to symbolize its intentions — the direction in \nwhich the life-stream is moving. \nOld Chinese texts that are concerned with \nthis kind of experience often use the simile of \nthe cat watching the mousehole. One text says \nthat one should allow no other thoughts to in­\ntrude, but one's attention should not be too \nsharp —nor should it be too dull. There is \nexactly the right level of perception. \"If the \ntraining is undergone in this manner ... it will \nbe effective as time goes on, and when the cause \ncomes to fruition, like a ripe melon that auto­\nmatically falls, anything it may happen to \ntouch or make contact with will suddenly cause \nthe individual's supreme awakening. This is the \nmoment when the practitioner will be like one \nwho drinks water and alone knows whether it \nis cold or warm. He becomes free of all doubts \nabout himself and experiences a great happiness \nsimilar to that one feels in meeting one's own \nfather at the crossroads.\" \nThus, in the midst of ordinary outer life, \none is suddenly caught up in an exciting inner \nadventure; and because it is unique for each \nindividual, it cannot be copied or stolen. \nThere are two main reasons why man loses \ncontact with the regulating center of his soul. \nOne of them is that some single instinctive drive \n2 I 2\n\f\nor emotional image can carry him into a one-\nsidedness that makes him lose his balance. This \nalso happens to animals; for example, a sexu­\nally excited stag will completely forget hunger \nand security. This one-sided ness and consequent \nloss of balance are much dreaded by primitives, \nwho call it \"loss of soul.\" Another threat to the \ninner balance comes from excessive daydream­\ning, which in a secret way usually circles around \nparticular complexes. In fact, daydreams arise \njust because they connect a man with his com­\nplexes; at the same time they threaten the con­\ncentration and continuity of his consciousness. \nThe second obstacle is exactly the opposite, \nand is due to an over-consolidation of ego-\nconsciousness. A11 hough a disci |)lined conscious­\nness is necessary for the performance of civilized \nactivities (we know what happens if a railway \nsignalman lapses into daydreaming), it has the \nserious disadvantage that it is apt to block the \nreception of impulses and messages coming from \nthe center. This is why so many dreams of \ncivilized people are concerned with restoring \nthis receptivity by attempting to correct the \nattitude of consciousness toward the uncon­\nscious center or Self. \nAmong the mythological representations of \nthe Self one finds much emphasis on the four \ncorners of the world, and in many pictures the \nGreat Man is represented in the center of a \ncircle divided into four. Jung used the Hindu \nword mandala (magic circle) to designate a \nstructure of this order, which is a symbolic re­\npresentation of the \"nuclear atom\" of the \nhuman psyche whose essence we do not know. \nIn this connection it is interesting that a Nas­\nkapi hunter pictorially represented his Great \nMan not as a human being but as a mandala. \nWhereas the Naskapi experience the inner \ncenter directly and naively, without the help of \nreligious rites or doctrines, other communities \nuse the mandala motif in order to restore a lost \ninner balance. Forinstance, the Navaho Indians \ntry, by means of mandala-structurcd sand \npaintings, to bring a sick person back into har­\nmony with himself and with the cosmos and \nthereby to restore his health. \nIn Eastern civilizations similar pictures are \nused to consolidate the inner being, or to enable \none to plunge into deep meditation. The con­\ntemplation of a mandala is meant to bring an \ninner peace, a feeling that life has again found \nits meaning and order. The mandala also con­\nveys this feeling when it appears spontaneously \nin the dreams of modern men who are not influ­\nenced by any religious tradition of this sort and \nknow nothing about it. Perhaps the positive \neffect is even greater in such cases because \nknowledge and tradition sometimes blur or even \nblock the spontaneous experience. \nAn example of a spontaneously produced \nmandala occurs in the following dream of a 62-\nThe feelings of boredom and apathy \nfrom which city dwellers today often \nsuffer is only temporarily offset \nby such artificial excitements as \nadventure films (far left) and time-\nkilling \"amusements\" (left). Jung \nstressed that the only real adventure \nremaining for each individual is the \nexploration of his own unconscious. \nThe ultimate goal of such a search \nis the forming of a harmonious and \nbalanced relationship with the Self \nThe circular mandala images this \nperfect balance —embodied in the \nstructure of the modern cathedral \n(right) of the city of Brasilia.\n\f\nTop, a Navaho makes a sand painting \n(a mandala) in a healing ritual; the \npatient sits in the painting.

It emerged as a prelude to a \nnew phase of life in which she became very \ncreative: \nI see a landscape in a dim light. In the back­\nground I see the rising and then evenly continu­\ning crest of a hill. Along the line where it rises \nmoves a quadrangular disk that shines like gold. \nIn the foreground I see dark plowed earth that is \nbeginning to sprout. Now I suddenly perceive a \nround table with a gray stone slab as its top, and \nat the same moment the quadrangular disk sud­\ndenly stands upon the table. It has left the hill, \nbut how and why it has changed its place I do \nnot know. \nLandscapes in dreams (as well as in art) fre­\nquently symbolize an inexpressible mood. In \nthis dream, the dim light of the landscape indi­\ncates that the clarity of daytime consciousness \nis dimmed. \"Inner nature\" may now begin to \nreveal itself in its own light, so we are told that \nthe quadrangular disk becomes visible on the \nhorizon. Hitherto the symbol of the Self, the \ndisk, had been largely an intuitive idea on the \ndreamer's mental horizon, but nowin thedream \nit shifts its position and becomes the center of \nthe landscape of her soul. A seed, sown long \nago, begins to sprout: for a long time previ­\nously the dreamer had paid careful attention \nto her dreams, and now this work bears fruit. \n(One is reminded of the relation between the \nsymbol of the Great Man and plant life, which \nI mentioned before.) Now the golden disk sud­\ndenly moves to the \"right\" side — the side where \nthings become conscious. Among other things \n\"right\" often means, psychologically, the side \nof consciousness, of adaptation, of being \"right,\" \nwhile \"left\" signifies the sphere of unadapted, \nunconscious reactions or sometimes even of \nsomething \"sinister.\" Then, finally, the golden \ndisk stops its movement and comes to rest on — \nsignificantly —a round stone table. It has found \na permanent base. \nAs Aniela Jaffe observes later in this book, \nroundness (the mandala motif) generally sym­\nbolizes a natural wholeness, whereas a quadr­\nangular formation represents the realization of \nthis in consciousness. In the dream the square \ndisk and the round table meet, and thus a con­\nscious realization of the center is at hand. The \nround table, incidentally, is a well-known sym­\nbol of wholeness and plays a i-ole in mythology \n— for instance, King Arthur's round table, \nwhich itself is an image derived from the table \nof the Last Supper. \nIn fact, whenever a human being genuinely \nturns to the inner world and tries to know him­\nself— not by ruminating about his subjective \nthoughts and feelings, but by following the ex­\npressions of his own objective nature such as \ndreams and genuine fantasies — then sooner or \nlater the Self emerges. The ego will then find \nan inner power that contains all the possibilities \nof renewal. \nIn the paintings, left, of the dream \nquoted on this page (painted by the \ndreamer), the mandala motif appears \nas a quadrangle rather than a circle \nUsually quadrangular forms symbolize \nconscious realization of inner \nwholeness: the wholeness itself is \nmost often represented in circular \nforms, such as the round table that \nalso appears in the dream. Right, \nthe legendary Round Table of King \nArthur (from a 15th-century \nmanuscript), at which the Holy \nGrail appeared in a vision and \nstarted the knights on the famous \nquest. The Grail itself symbolizes \nthe inner wholeness for which men \nhave always been searching.\n\f\nBut there is a great difficulty that I have \nmentioned only indirectly up till now. This is \nthat every personification of the unconscious — \nthe shadow, the anima, the animus, and the Self \n— has both a light and a dark aspect. We saw \nbefore that the shadow may be base or evil, an \ninstinctive drive that one ought to overcome. \nIt may, however, be an impulse toward growth \nthat one should cultivate and follow. In the \nsame way the anima and animus have dual \naspects: They can bring life-giving development \nand creativeness to the personality, or they can \ncause petrification and physical death. And \neven the Self, the all-embracing symbol of the \nunconscious, has an ambivalent effect, as for in­\nstance in the Eskimo tale (page 196), when \nthe \"little woman\" offered to save the heroine \nfrom the Moon Spirit but actually turned her \ninto a spider. \nThe dark side of the Self is the most dan­\ngerous thing of all, precisely because the Self \nis the greatest power in the psyche. It can \ncause people to \"spin\" megalomaniac or other \ndelusory fantasies that catch them up and \n\"possess\" them. A person in this state thinks \nwith mounting excitement that he has grasped \nand solved the great cosmic riddles; he there­\nfore loses all touch with human reality. A re­\nliable symptom of this condition is the loss of \none's sense of humor and of human contacts. \nThus the emerging of the Self may bring \ngreat danger to a man's conscious ego. The \ndouble aspect of the Self is beautifully illustra­\nted by this old Iranian fairy tale, called \"The \nSecret of the Bath Badgerd\": \nThe great and noble Prince Hatim Tai receives \norders from his king to investigate the mysterious \nBath Badgerd [castle of nonexistence]. When he \napproaches it, having gone through many dan­\ngerous adventures, he hears that nobody ever re­\nturned from it, but he insists on going on. He is \nreceived at a round building by a barber with a \nmirror who leads him into the bath, but as soon \nas the prince enters the water, a thunderous noise \nbreaks out. it gets completely dark, the barber \ndisappears, and slowly the water begins to rise. \nHatim swims desperately round until the water \nfinally reaches the top of the round cupola, which \nforms the roof of the bath. Now he fears he is \nlost, but he says a prayer and grabs the center-\nstone of the cupola. Again a thunderous noise, \neverything changes, and Hatim stands alone in a \ndesert. \nAfter long and painful wandering, he comes to \na beautiful garden in the middle of which is a \ncircle of stone statues. In the center of the statues, \nhe sees a parrot in its cage, and a voice from above \nsays to him: \"Oh, hero, you probably will not \nescape alive from this bath. Once Gayomart [the \nFirst Man] found an enormous diamond that \nshone more brightly than sun and moon. He de­\ncided to hide it where no one can find it, and \ntherefore he built this magical bath in order to\n\f\nprotect it. The parrot that you see here forms \npart of the magic. At its feet lie a golden bow and \narrow on a golden chain, and with them you \nmay try three times to shoot the parrot. If you \nhit him the curse will be lifted; if not, you will \nbe petrified, as were all these other people.\" \nHatim tries once, and fails. His legs turn to \nstone. He fails once more and is petrified up to \nhis chest. The third time he just shuts his eyes, \nexclaiming \"God is great,\" shoots blindly, and \nthis time hits the parrot. An outbreak of thun­\nder, clouds of dust. When all this has subsided, in \nplace of the parrot is an enormous, beautiful dia­\nmond, and all the statues have come to life again. \nThe people thank him for their redemption. \nThe reader will recognize the symbols of the \nSelf in this story- the First Man Gayomart, the \nround mandala-shaped building, the center-\nstone, and the diamond. But this diamond is \nsurrounded by danger. The demonic parrot \nsignifies the evil spirit of imitation that makes \none miss the target and petrify psychologically. \nAs I pointed out earlier, the process of indivi­\nduation excludes any parrot-like imitation of \nothers. Time and again in all countries people \nhave tried to copy in \"outer\" or ritualistic be­\nhavior the original religious experience of their \ngreat religious teachers Christ or Buddha or \nsome other master —and have therefore become \n\"petrified.\" To follow in the steps of a great \nspiritual leader does not mean that one should \ncopy and act out the pattern of the individua­\ntion process made by his life. It means that we \nshould try with a sincerity and devotion equal \nto his to live our own lives. \nThe barber with the mirror, who vanishes, \nsymbolizes the gift of reflection that Hatim \nloses when he wants it most; the rising waters \nrepresent the risk that one may drown in the \nunconscious and get lost in one's own emotions. \nIn order to understand the symbolic indications \nof the unconscious, one must be careful not to \nget outside oneself or \"beside oneself,\" but to \nstay emotionally within oneself. Indeed, it is \nvitally important that the ego should continue \nto function in normal ways. Only if I remain \nan ordinary human being, conscious of my in­\ncompleteness, can I become receptive to the \nsignificant contents and processes of the uncon­\nscious. But how can a human being stand the \ntension ol feeling himself at one with the whole \nuniverse, while at the same time he is only a \nmiserable earthly human creature? If, on the \none hand, I despise myself as merely a statistical \ncipher, my life has no meaning and is not worth \nliving. But if, on the other hand, I feel myself \nto be part of something much greater, how am \nI to keep my feet on the ground? It is very \ndifficult indeed to keep these inner opposites \nunited within oneself without toppling over into \none or the other extreme. \nFar left, the torrential waters \nof the river Heraclitos overwhelm \na Greek temple, in a painting by \nthe modern French artist Andre \nMasson The painting can be seen \nas an allegory of the results of \nimbalance: Greek overemphasis on \nlogic and reason (the temple) \nleading to a destructive eruption \nof instinctual forces Left, a \nmore direct allegory, from a \n15th-century illustration to the \nFrench allegorical poem  Le Roman \nde la Rose:  the figure of Logic (on \nthe right) is thrown into confusion \nwhen confronted by Nature \nRight, the repentant St Mary \nMagdalen gazes into a mirror (in \na painting by the 1 7th-century \nFrench artist Georges de la Tour) \nHere, as in the tale of the Bath \nBadgerd, the mirror symbolizes the \nmuch-needed faculty of true, \ninward-looking \"reflection,\"\n\f\nThe social aspect of the Self \nToday the enormous growth of population, \nespecially obvious in large cities, inevitably has \na depressing effect on us. We think, \"Oh, well, \nI am only so-and-so living at such-and-such an \naddress, like thousands of other people. If a \nfew of them get killed, what difference can it \nmake? There are far too many people in any \ncase.\" And when we read in the paper about the \ndeaths of innumerable unknown people who \npersonally mean nothing to us, the feeling that \nour lives count for nothing is further increased. \nThis is the moment when attention to the un­\nconscious brings the greatest help, for dreams \nshow the dreamer how each detail of his life is \ninterwoven with the most significant realities. \nWhat we all know theoretically — that every \nthing depends on the individual — becomes \nthrough dreams a palpable fact that everyone \ncan experience for himself. Sometimes we have \na strong feeling that the Great Man wants \nsomething from us and has set us very special \ntasks. Our response to this experience can help \nus to acquire the strength to swim against the \nstream of collective prejudice by taking our \nown soul seriously into account. \nNaturally this is not always an agreeable \ntask. For instance, you want to make a trip with \nfriends next Sunday; then a dream forbids it \nand demands that you do some creative work \ninstead. If you listen to your unconscious and \nobey it, you must expect constant interference \nwith your conscious plans. Your will is crossed \nby other intentions — intentions that you must \nsubmit to, or at any rate must seriously con­\nsider. This is partly why the obligation attached \nto the process of individuation is often felt to be \na burden rather than an immediate blessing. \nSt. Christopher, the patron of all travelers, \nis a fitting symbol for this experience. According \nto the legend, he felt an arrogant pride in his \ntremendous physical strength, and was willing \nto serve only the strongest. First he served a \nking; but when he saw that the king feared \nthe devil, he left him and became the devil's \nservant. Then one day he discovered that the \ndevil feared the crucifix, and so he decided to \nserve Christ if he could find him. He followed \nthe advice of a priest who told him to wait for \nChrist at a ford. In the years that passed he \ncarried many people across the river. But once, \non a dark, stormy night, a small child called \nout that he wanted to be carried over the river. \nWith the greatest ease, St. Christopher lifted \nthe child on to his shoulders, but he walked\n\f\nThe achievement of psychological \nmaturity is an individual task— \nand so is increasingly difficult \ntoday when man's individuality is \nthreatened by widespread conformity. \nFar left, a British housing development \nwith its stereotyped dwellings; \nleft, a Swiss athletics display \nprovides an image of mass \nregimentation. \nmore slowly with every step, for his burden be­\ncame heavier and heavier. When he arrived in \nmidstream, he felt \"as if he carried the whole \nuniverse.\" He realized then that he had taken \nChrist upon his shoulders — and Christ gave \nhim remission of his sins and eternal life. \nThis miraculous child is a symbol of the Self \nthat literally \"depresses\" the ordinary human \nbeing, even though it is the only thing that can \nredeem him. In many works of art the Christ \nchild is depicted as, or with, the sphere of the \nworld, a motif that clearly denotes the Self, for \na child and a sphere are both universal symbols \nof totality. \nWhen a person tries to obey the unconscious, \nhe will often, as we have seen, be unable to do \njust as he pleases. But equally he will often be \nunable to do what other people want him to \ndo. It often happens, for instance, that he must \nseparate from his group — from his family, his \npartner, or other personal connections—in \norder to find himself. That is why it is sometimes \nsaid that attending to the unconscious makes \npeople antisocial and egocentric. As a rule this \nis not true, for there is a little-known factor that \nenters into this attitude: the collective (or, we \ncould even say, social) aspect of the Self. \nAbove, a page from William Blake's \nSongs of Innocence and Experience, \nin which the poems reveal Blake's \nconcept of the \"divine child\"—a \nwell-known symbol of the Self. \nRight, a 16th-century painting of \nSt. Christopher carrying Christ \nas a divine child (who is encircled \nby a world sphere—a mandala and \na symbol of the Self). This burden \nsymbolizes the \"weight\" of the \ntask of individuation—just as St. \nChristopher's role as the patron \nof travelers (far right, a St. \nChristopher medallion on a car's \nignition key) reflects his link \nwith man's need to travel the path \nto psychological wholeness.\n\f\nFrom a practical angle this factor reveals \nitself in that an individual who follows his \ndreams for a considerable time will find that \nthey are often concerned with his relationships \nwith other people. His dreams may warn him \nagainst trusting a certain person too much, or \nhe may dream about a favorable and agreeable \nmeeting with someone whom he may previously \nhave never consciously noticed. If a dream does \npick up the image of another person for us in \nsome such fashion, there are two possible inter­\npretations. First, the figure may be a projection, \nwhich means that the dream-image of this per­\nson is a symbol for an inner aspect of the \ndreamer himself. One dreams, for instance, of \na dishonest neighbor, but the neighbor is used \nby the dream as a picture of one's own dis­\nhonesty. It is the task of dream interpretation \nto find out in which special areas one's own \ndishonesty comes into play. (This is called \ndream interpretation on the subjective level.) \nBut it also happens at times that dreams \ngenuinely tell us something about other people. \nIn this way, the unconscious plays a role that is \nfar from being fully understood. Like all the \nhigher forms of life, man is in tune with the \nliving beings around him to a remarkable de­\ngree. He perceives their sufferings and prob­\nlems, their positive and negative attributes and \nvalues, instinctively — quite independently of \nhis conscious thoughts about other people. \nOur dream life allows us to have a look at \nthese subliminal perceptions and shows us that \nthey have an effect upon us. After having an \nagreeable dream about somebody, even with­\nout interpreting the dream, I shall involuntarily \nlook at that person with more interest. The \ndream image may have deluded me, because \nof my projections; or it may have given me \nobjective information. To find out which is the \nThe conscious realization of the \nSelf can create a bond among people \nthat ignores more obvious, natural \ngroups like the family (above left) \nA mental kinship on a conscious \nlevel can often be the nucleus of \ncultural development: above, the \n18th-century French encyclopedists \n(including Voltaire, with raised \nhand); below, a painting by Max Ernst \nof the early 20th-century \"Dadaist\" \nartists; and research physicists \nat Britain's Wills Laboratory \n220\n\f\nThe psychological balance and unity \nthat man needs today have been \nsymbolized in many modern dreams \nby the union of the French girl \nand the Japanese man in the widely \npopular French film  Hiroshima Mon \nAmour (1 959), above And in the \nsame dreams, the opposite extreme \nfrom wholeness (i.e. complete \npsychological dissociation, or \nmadness) has been symbolized by \na related 20th-century image— \na nuclear explosion (right). \ncorrect interpretation requires an honest, atten­\ntive attitude and careful thought. But, as is the \ncase with all inner processes, it is ultimately the \nSelf that orders and regulates one's human rela­\ntionships, so long as the conscious ego lakes \nthe trouble to detect the delusive projections \nand deals with these inside himself instead of \noutside. It is in this way that spiritually attuned \nand similarly oriented people find their way to \none another, to create a group that cuts across \nall the usual social and organizational affilia­\ntions of people. Such a group is not in conflict \nwith others; it is merely different and inde­\npendent. The consciously realized process of \nindividuation thus changes a person's relation­\nships. The familiar bonds such as kinship or \ncommon interests are replaced by a different \ntype of unity — a bond through the Self. \nAll activities and obligations that belong ex­\nclusively to the outer world do definite harm to \nthe secret activities of the unconscious. Through \nthese unconscious ties those who belong to­\ngether come together. That is one reason why \nattempts to influence people by advertisements \nand political propaganda are destructive, even \nwhen inspired by idealistic motives. \nThis raises the important question of whether \nthe unconscious part of the human psyche can \nbe influenced at all. Practical experience and \naccurate observation show that one cannot in­\nfluence one's own dreams. There are people, it \nis true, who assert that they can influence them. \nBut if you look into their dream material, you \nfind that they do only what I do with my dis­\nobedient dog; I order him to do those things I \nnotice he wants to do anyhow, so that I can \npreserve my illusion of authority. Only a long \nprocess of interpreting one's dreams and con­\nfronting oneself with what they have to say can \ngradually transform the unconscious. And con­\nscious attitudes also must change in this process. \nIf a man who wants to influence public \nopinion misuses symbols for this purpose, they \nwill naturally impress the masses in so far as \nthey are true symbols, but whether or not the \nmass unconscious will be emotionally gripped \nby them is something that cannot be calculated \nin advance, something that remains completely \nirrational. No music publisher, for instance, can \ntell in advance whether a song will become a \nhit or not, even though it may draw on popular \nimages and melodies. No deliberate attempts to \ninfluence the unconscious have yet produced \nany significant results, and it seems that the \nmass unconscious preserves its autonomy just \nas much as the individual unconscious. \n22 I\n\f\nAt times, in order to express its purposes, the \nunconscious may use a motif from our external \nworld and thus may seem to have been influ­\nenced by it. For instance, I have come across \nmany dreams of modern people that have to \ndo with Berlin. In these dreams Berlin stands \nas a symbol of the psychic weak spot—the \nplace of danger—and for this reason is the \nplace where the Self is apt to appear. It is the \npoint where the dreamer is torn by conflict and \nwhere he might, therefore, be able to unite the \ninner opposites. I have also encountered an \nextraordinary number of dream reactions to the \nfilm Hiroshima Mon Amour. In most of these \ndreams the idea was expressed that either the \ntwo lovers in the film must unite (which sym­\nbolizes the union of inner opposites) or there \nwould be an atomic explosion (a symbol of com­\nplete dissociation, equivalent to madness). \nOnly when the manipulators of public \nopinion add commercial pressure or acts of \nviolence to their activities do they seem to \nachieve a temporary success. But in fact this \nmerely causes a repression of the genuine un­\nconscious reactions. And mass repression leads \nto the same result as individual repression; that \nis, to neurotic dissociation and psychological \nillness. All such attempts to repress the reactions \nof the unconscious must fail in the long run, for \nthey are basically opposed to our instincts. \nWe know from studying the social behavior \nof the higher animals that small groups (from \napproximately 10 to 50 individuals) create the \nAs in the dream quoted on p. 223, \npositive anima figures often assist \nand guide men. Top of page, from a \n10th-century psalter, David inspired \nby the muse. Above, a goddess \nsaves a shipwrecked sailor (in a 16th-\ncentury painting). Right, on an early \n20th-century postcard from Monte \nCarlo, gamblers' \"Lady Luck\"—also \na helpful anima. \n111 \nRight, Liberty leading the French \nrevolutionaries (in a painting by \nDelacroix) images the anima's \nfunction of assisting individuation \nby liberating unconscious contents \nFar right, in a scene from the 1925 \nfantasy film  Metropolis,  a woman \nurges robot-like workers to find \nspiritual \"liberation.\"\n\f\nbest possible living conditions for the single \nanimal as well as for the group, and man seems \nto be no exception in this respect. His physical \nwell-being, his spiritual psychic health, and, \nbeyond the animal realm, his cultural efficiency \nseem to flourish best in such a social function. \nAs far as we at present understand the process \nof individuation, the Self apparently tends to \nproduce such small groups by creating at the \nsame time sharply defined ties of feeling be­\ntween certain individuals and feelings of re-\nlatedness to all people. Only if these connections \nare created by the Self can one feel any assur­\nance that envy, jealousy, fighting, and all man­\nner of negative projections will not break up the \ngroup. Thus an unconditional devotion to one's \nown process of individuation also brings about \nthe best possible adaptation. \nThis does not mean, of course, that there \nwill not be collisions of opinion and conflicting \nobligations, or disagreement about the \"right\" \nway. in the face of which one must constantly \nwithdraw and listen to one's inner voice in \norder to find the individual standpoint that the \nSelf intends one to have. \nFanatical political activity (but not the per­\nformance of essential duties) seems somehow-\nincompatible with individuation. A man who \ndevoted himself entirely to freeing his country \nfrom foreign occupation had this dream: \nWith some of my compatriots I go up a stair­\nway to the attic of a museum, where there is a \nhall painted black and looking like a cabin on a \nship. A distinguished-looking middle-aged lady \nopens the door; her name is X, daughter of X. \n[X was a famous national hero of the dreamer's \ncountry who attempted some centuries ago to free \nit. He might be compared to Joan of Arc or Wil­\nliam Tell. In reality X had no children.] In the \nhall we see the portraits of two aristocratic ladies \ndressed in flowery brocaded garments. While Miss \nX is explaining these pictures to us, they sud­\ndenly come to life; first the eyes begin to live, and \nthen the chest seems to breathe. People are sur­\nprised and go to a lecture room where Miss X \nwill speak to them about the phenomenon. She \nsays that through her intuition and feeling these \nportraits came alive; but some of the people are \nindignant and say that Miss X is mad; some even \nleave the lecture room. \nThe important feature of this dream is that \nthe anima figure, Miss X, is purely a creation \nof the dream. She has, however, the name of a \nfamous national hero-liberator (as if she were, \nfor instance. Wilhelmina Tell, the daughter of \nWilliam Tell). By the implications contained in \nthe name, the unconscious is pointing to the \nfact that today the dreamer should not try, as \nX did long ago, to free his country in an outer \nway. Now, the dream says, liberation is accom­\nplished by the anima (by the dreamer's soul), \nwho accomplishes it by bringing the images of \nthe unconscious to life. \nThat the hall in the attic of the museum \nlooks partly like a ship's cabin painted black is \nvery meaningful. The black color hints at dark­\nness, night, a turning inward, and if the hall is \n223\n\f\na cabin, then the museum is somehow also a \nship. This suggests that when the mainland of \ncollective consciousness becomes flooded by un­\nconsciousness and barbarism, this museum-ship, \nfilled with living images, may turn into a saving \nark that will carry those who enter it to another \nspiritual shore. Portraits hanging in a museum \nare usually the dead remains of the past, and \noften the images of the unconscious are re­\ngarded in the same way until we discover that \nthey are alive and meaningful. When the anima \n(who appears here in her rightful role of soul-\nguide) contemplates the images with intuition \nand feeling, they begin to live. \nThe indignant people in the dream represent \nthe side of the dreamer that is influenced by \ncollective opinion—something in him that dis­\ntrusts and rejects the bringing to life of psychic \nimages. They personify a resistance to the un­\nconscious that might express itself something \nlike this: \"But what if they begin dropping \natom bombs on us? Psychological insight won't \nbe much help then!\" \nThis resistant side is unable to free itself from \nstatistical thinking and from extraverted \nrational prejudices. The dream, however, points \nout that in our time genuine liberation can start \nonly with a psychological transformation. To \nwhat end does one liberate one's country if \nafterward there is no meaningful goal of life-\nno .goal for which it is worthwhile to be free? \nIf man no longer finds any meaning in his life, \nit makes no difference whether he wastes away \nunder a Communist or a capitalist regime. Only \nif he can use his freedom to create something \nmeaningful is it relevant that he should be free. \nThat is why finding the inner meaning of life \nis more important to the individual than any­\nthing else, and why the process of individuation \nmust be given priority. \nAttempts to influence public opinion by \nmeans of newspapers, radio, television, and \nadvertising are based on two factors. On the \none hand, they rely on sampling techniques that \nreveal the trend of \"opinion\" or \"wants\"- -that \nis, of collective attitudes. On the other, they \nexpress prejudices, projections, and uncon­\nscious complexes (mainly the power complex) \nof those who manipulate public opinion. But \nstatistics do no justice to the individual. \nAlthough the average size of stones in a heap \nmay be five centimeters, one will find very few \nstones of exactly this size in the heap. \nThat the second factor cannot create any­\nthing positive is clear from the start. But if a \nsingle individual devotes himself to individua­\ntion, he frequently has a positive contagious \neffect on the people around him. It is as if a \nspark leaps from one to another. And this usu­\nally occurs when one has no intention of influ­\nencing others and often when one uses no \nwords. It is onto this inner path that Miss X \ntried to lead the dreamer. \nNearly all religious systems on our planet \ncontain images that symbolize the process of \nindividuation, or at least some stages of it. In \nChristian countries the Self is projected, as I \nsaid before, onto the second Adam: Christ. In \nthe East the relevant figures are those of \nKrishna and Buddha. \nFor people who are contained in a religion \n(that is, who still really believe in its content \nand teachings), the psychological regulation of \ntheir lives is effected by religious symbols, and \neven their dreams often revolve around them. \nWhen the late Pope Pius XII issued the decla­\nration of the Assumption of Mary, a Catholic \nwoman dreamed, for instance, that she was a \nCatholic priestess. Her unconscious seemed to \nextend the dogma in this way: \"If Mary is now \nalmost a goddess, she should have priestesses.\" \nAnother Catholic woman, who had resistances \nto some of the minor and outer aspects of her \ncreed, dreamed that the church of her home \ncity had been pulled down and rebuilt, but that \nthe tabernacle with the consecrated host and \nthe statue of the Virgin Mary were to be trans­\nferred from the old to the new church. The \ndream showed her that some of the man-made \naspects of her religion needed renewal, but that \nits basic symbols — Cod's having become Man, \nand the Great Mother, the Virgin Mary— \nwould survive the change. \nSuch dreams demonstrate the living interest \nthat the unconscious takes in the conscious re­\nligious representations of an individual. This \n224\n\f\nraises the question whether it is possible to de­\ntect a general trend in all the religious dreams \nof contemporary people. In the manifestations \nof the unconscious found in our modern Chris­\ntian culture, whether Protestant or Catholic, \nDr. Jung often observed that there is an un­\nconscious tendency at work to round off our \ntrinitarian formula of the Godhead with a \nfourth element, which tends to be feminine, \ndark, and even evil. Actually this fourth ele­\nment has always existed in the realm of our \nreligious representations, but it was separated \nfrom the image of God and became his coun­\nterpart, in the form of matter itself (or the lord \nof matter —i.e. the devil). Now the unconscious \nseems to want to reunite these extremes, the \nlight having become too bright and the dark­\nness too somber. Naturally it is the central sym­\nbol of religion, the image of the Godhead, that \nis most exposed to unconscious tendencies to­\nward transformation. \nA Tibetan abbot once told Dr. Jung that the \nmost impressive mandalas in Tibet are built up \nby imagination, or directed fantasy, when the \npsychological balance of the group is disturbed \nor when a particular thought cannot be rend­\nered because it is not yet contained 1n the sac­\nred doctrine and must therefore be searched \nfor. In these remarks, two equally important \nbasic aspects of mandala symbolism emerge. \nThe mandala serves a conservative purpose-\nnamely, to restore a previously existing order. \nBut it also serves the creative purpose of giving \nexpression and form to something that does \nnot yet exist, something new and unique. The \nsecond aspect is perhaps even more important \nthan the first, but does not contradict it. For, \nin most cases, what restores the old order simul­\ntaneously involves some element of new crea­\ntion. In the new order the older pattern returns \non a higher level. The process is that of the \nascending spiral, which grows upward while \nsimultaneously returning again and again to the \nsame point. \nA painting by a simple woman who was \nbrought up in Protestant surroundings shows a \nmandala in the form of a spiral. In a dream \nthis woman received an order to paint the God­\nhead. Later (also in a dream) she saw it in a \nbook. Of God himself she saw only his wafting \ncloak, the drapery of which made a beautiful \ndisplay of light and shadow. This contrasted \nimpressively with the stability of the spiral in \nthe deep blue sky. Fascinated by the cloak and \nthe .spiral, the dreamer did not look closely at \nthe other figure on the rocks. When she awoke \nand thought about who these divine figures \nwere, she suddenly realized that it was \"God \nhimself.\" This gave her a frightful shock, which \nshe felt for a long time. \nUsually the Holy Ghost is represented in \nChristian art by a fiery wheel or a dove, but \nhere it has appeared as a spiral. This is a new \nthought, \"not yet contained in the doctrine,\" \nThis 1 5th-century statue of Mary \ncontains within it images of both \nGod and Christ—a clear expression \nof the fact that the Virgin Mary \ncan be said to be a representation \nof the \"Great Mother\" archetype \n225\n\f\nA miniature from the 1 5th-century \nFrench  Book of Hours,  showing Mary \nwith the Holy Trinity. The Catholic \nChurch's dogma of the Assumption \nof the Virgin — in which Mary, as \ndomina rerum.  Queen of Nature, was \ndeclared to have entered heaven \nwith soul and body reunited—can \nbe said to have made the Trinity \nfourfold, corresponding with the \nbasic archetype of completeness \nwhich has spontaneously arisen from the un­\nconscious. That the Holy Ghost is the power \nthat works for the further development of our \nreligious understanding is not a new idea, of \ncourse, but its symbolic representation in the \nform of a spiral is new. \nThe same woman then painted a second \npicture, also inspired by a dream, showing the \ndreamer with her positive animus standing \nabove Jerusalem when the wing of Satan de­\nscends to darken the city. The satanic wing \nstrongly reminded her of the wafting cloak of \nGod in the first painting, but in the former \ndream the spectator is high up, somewhere in \nheaven, and sees in front of her a terrific split \nbetween the rocks. The movement in the cloak \nof God is an attempt to reach Christ, the figure \non the right, but it does not quite succeed. In \nthe second painting, the same thing is seen from \nbelow from a human angle. Looking at it \nfrom a higher angle, what is moving and \nspreading is a part of God; above that rises the \nspiral as a symbol of possible further develop­\nment. But seen from the basis of our human \nreality, this same thing in the air is the dark, \nuncanny wing of the devil. \nIn the dreamer's life these two pictures be­\ncame real in a way that does not concern us \nhere, but it is obvious that they also contain a \ncollective meaning that reaches beyond the per­\nsonal. They may prophesy the descent of a \ndivine darkness upon the Christian hemisphere, \na darkness that points, however, toward the \npossibility of further evolution. Since the axis \nof the spiral does not move upward but into \nthe background of the picture, the further evo­\nlution will lead neither to greater spiritual \nheight nor down into the realm of matter, but \nto another dimension, probably into the back­\nground of these divine figures. And that means \ninto the unconscious. \nWhen religious symbols that are partly dif­\nferent from those we know emerge from the \nunconscious of an individual, it is often feared \nthat these will wrongfully alter or diminish the \nofficially recognized religious symbols. This fear \neven causes many people to reject analytical \npsychology and the entire unconscious. \n226\n\f\nII I look at such a resistance from a psy­\nchological point of view, I should have to com­\nment that as far as religion is concerned, \nhuman beings can be divided into three types. \nFirst, there are those who still genuinely believe \ntheir religious doctrines, whatever they may be. \nFor these people, the symbols and doctrines \n\"click\" so satisfyingly with what they feel deep \ninside themselves that serious doubts have no \nchance to sneak in. This happens when the \nviews of consciousness and the unconscious \nbackground are in relative harmony. People of \nthis sort can afford to look at new psycho­\nlogical discoveries and facts without prejudice \nand need not fear that they may be caused to \nlose their faith. Even if their dreams should \nbring up some relatively unorthodox details, \nthese can be integrated into their general view. \nThe second type consists of those people who \nhave completely lost their faith and have re­\nplaced it with purely conscious, rational \nopinions. For these people, depth psychology \nsimply means an introduction into newly dis­\ncovered areas of the psyche, and it should cause \nno trouble when they embark on the new ad­\nventure and investigate their dreams to test the \ntruth of them. \nThen there is a third group of people who in \none part of themselves (probably the head) no \nlonger believe in their religious traditions, \nwhereas in some other part they still do believe. \nThe French philosopher Voltaire is an illustra­\ntion of this. He violently attacked the Catholic \nChurch with rational argument (ecrasez I'in-\nfdme), but on his deathbed, according to some \nreports, he begged for extreme unction. \nWhether this is true or not, his head was cer-\ntainly unreligious, whereas his feelings and \nemotions seem still to have been orthodox. Such \npeople remind one of a person getting stuck \nin the automatic doors of a bus; he can neither \nget out into free space nor re-enter the bus. Of \ncourse the dreams of such persons could prob­\nably help them out of their dilemma, but such \npeople frequently have trouble turning toward \nthe unconscious because they themselves do not \nknow what they think and want. To take the \nunconscious seriously is ultimately a matter of \npersonal courage and integrity. \nThe complicated situation of those who are \ncaught in a no-man's-land between the two \nstates of mind is partly created by the fact that \nall official religious doctrines actually belong to \nthe collective consciousness (what Freud called \nthe super-ego); but once, long ago, they sprang \nfrom the unconscious. This is a point that many \nhistorians of religion and theologians challenge. \nThey choose to assume that there was once \nsome sort of \"revelation.\" I have searched for \nmany years for concrete evidence for the Jun-\nPaintings of the dreams discussed \non pp. 225-6: Left, the spiral (a \nform of mandala) represents the \nHoly Ghost; right, the dark wing \nof Satan, from the second dream \nNeither motif would be a familiar \nreligious symbol to most people \n(nor were they to the dreamer): \nEach emerged spontaneously \nfrom the unconscious.\n\f\ngian hypothesis about this problem; but it has \nbeen difficult to find because most rituals are \nso old that one cannot trace their origin. The \nfollowing example, however, seems to me to \noffer a most important clue: \nBlack Elk, a medicine man of the Oglala \nSioux, who died not long ago, tells us in his \nautobiography Black Elk Speaks that, when he \nwas nine years old, he became seriously ill and \nduring a sort of coma had a tremendous vision. \nHe saw four groups of beautiful horses coming \nfrom the four corners of the world, and then, \nseated within a cloud, he saw the Six Grand­\nfathers, the ancestral spirits of his tribe, \"the \ngrandfathers of the whole world.\" They gave \nhim six healing symbols for his people and \nshowed him new ways of life. But when he was \n16 years old, he suddenly developed a terrible \nphobia whenever a thunder storm was ap­\nproaching, because he heard \"thunder beings\" \ncalling to him \"to make haste.\" It reminded \nhim of the thundering noise made by the ap­\nproaching horses in his vision. An old medicine \nman explained to him that his fear came from \nthe fact that he was keeping his vision to him­\nself, and said that he must tell it to his tribe. \nHe did so, and later he and his people acted \nout the vision in a ritual, using real horses. \nNot merely Black Elk himself, but many other \nmembers of his tribe felt infinitely better after \nthis play. Some were even cured of their dis­\neases. Black Elk said: \"Even the horses seemed \nto be healthier and happier after the dance.\" \nThe ritual was not repeated because the tribe \nwas destroyed soon afterward. But here is a \ndifferent case in which a ritual still survives. \nSeveral Eskimo tribes living near the Colville \nRiver in Alaska explain the origin of their eagle \nfestival in the following way: \nA young hunter shot dead a very unusual eagle \nand was so impressed by the beauty of the dead \nbird that he stuffed and made a fetish of him, \nhonoring him by sacrifices. One day, when the \nhunter had traveled far inland during his hunt­\ning, two animal-men suddenly appeared in the \nrole of messengers and led him to the land of the \neagles. There he heard a dark drumming noise, \nand the messengers explained that this was the \nheartbeat of the dead eagle's mother. Then the \neagle spirit appeared to the hunter as a woman \nclothed in black. She asked him to initiate an \neagle festival among his people to honor her dead \nson. After the eagle people had shown him how \nto do this, he suddenly found himself, exhausted, \nback in the place where he had met the messen­\ngers. Returning home, he taught his people how \nto perform the great eagle festival—as they have \ndone faithfully ever since. \nFrom such examples we see how a ritual or \nreligious custom can spring directly from an \nunconscious revelation experienced by a single \nindividual. Out of such beginnings, people liv­\ning in cultural groups develop their various re­\nligious activities with their enormous influence \non the entire life of the society. During a long \nprocess of evolution the original material is \nshaped and reshaped by words and actions, is \nbeautified, and acquires increasingly definite \nforms. This crystallizing process, however, has \na great disadvantage. More and more people \nhave no personal knowledge of the original ex­\nperience and can only believe what their elders \nand teachers tell them about it. They no longer \nknow that such happenings are real, and they \nare of course ignorant about how one feels dur­\ning the experience. \nIn their present forms, worked over and ex­\nceedingly aged, such religious traditions often \nresist further creative alterations by the uncon­\nscious. Theologians sometimes even defend \nthese \"true\" religious symbols and symbolic \ndoctrines against the discovery of a religious \nfunction in the unconscious psyche, forgetting \nthat the values they fight for owe their exist­\nence to that very same function. Without a \nhuman psyche to receive divine inspirations \nand utter them in words or shape them in art, \nno religious symbol has ever come into the \nreality of our human life. (We need only think \nof the prophets and the evangelists.) \nIf someone objects that there is a religious \nreality in itself, independent of the human \npsyche, I can only answer such a person with \nthis question: \"Who says this, if not a human \npsyche?\" No matter what we assert, we can \n2 2Q\n\f\nnever get away from the existence of the psyche \n—for we are contained within it, and it is the \nonly means by which we can grasp reality. \nThus the modern discovery of the uncon­\nscious shuts one door forever. It definitely ex­\ncludes the illusory idea, so favored by some \nindividuals, that a man can know spiritual \nreality in itself. In modern physics, too, a door \nhas been closed by Heisenberg's \"principle of \nindeterminacy,\" shutting out the delusion that \nwe can comprehend an absolute physical re­\nality. The discovery of the unconscious, how­\never, compensates for the loss of these beloved \nillusions by opening before us an immense and \nunexplored new field of realizations, within \nwhich objective scientific investigation com­\nbines in a strange new way with personal \nethical adventure. \nBut, as I said at the outset, it is practically \nimpossible to impart the whole reality of one's \nexperience in the new field. Much is unique \nand can be only partially communicated by \nlanguage. Here, too, a door is shut against the \nillusion that one can completely understand \nanother person and tell him what is right for \nhim. Once again, however, one can find a com­\npensation for this in the new realm of experi­\nence by the discovery of the social function of \nthe Self, which works in a hidden way to \nunite separate individuals who belong together. \nIntellectual chit-chat is thus replaced by-\nmeaningful events that occur in the reality of \nthe psyche. Hence, for the individual to enter \nseriously into the process of individuation in the \nway that has been outlined means a completely \nnew and different orientation toward life. For \nscientists it also means a new and different \nscientific approach to outer facts. How this will \nwork out in the field of human knowledge and \nin the social life of human beings cannot be \npredicted. But to me it seems certain that \nJung's discovery of the process of individuation \nis a fact that future generations will have to \ntake into account if they want to avoid drifting \ninto a stagnant or even regressive outlook. \nThis painting (by Erhard Jacoby) \nillustrates the fact that each of \nus, perceiving the world through \nan individual psyche, perceives it \nin a slightly different way from \nothers The man, woman, and child \nare looking at the same scene; but, \nfor each, different details become \nclear or obscured Only by means of \nour conscious perception does the \nworld exist \"outside\": We are \nsurrounded by something completely \nunknown and unknowable (here \nrepresented by the painting's \ngray background) \n229\n\f\nSymbolism in the visual arts \nAniela Jaffe \nVariation within a Sphere no. 10: The Sun,  by Richard Lippold \n4\n\f\n\n\f\nSacred symbols—the stone and the animal \nThe history of symbolism shows that everything \ncan assume symbolic significance: natural \nobjects (like stones, plants, animals, men, moun­\ntains and valleys, sun and moon, wind, water, \nand fire), or man-made things (like houses, \nboats, or cars), or even abstract forms (like num­\nbers, or the triangle, the square, and the circle). \nIn fact, the whole cosmos is a potential symbol. \nMan, with his symbol-making propensity, \nunconsciously transforms objects or forms into \nsymbols (thereby endowing them with great psy­\nchological importance) and expresses them in \nboth his religion and his visual art. The inter­\ntwined history of religion and art, reaching back \nto prehistoric times, is the record that our ances­\ntors have left of the symbols that were mean­\ningful and moving to them. Even today, as \nmodern painting and sculpture show, the inter­\nplay of religion and art is still alive. \nFor the first part of my discussion of sym­\nbolism in the visual arts, I intend to examine \nsome of the specific motifs that have been uni­\nversally sacred or mysterious to man. Then, for \nthe remainder of the chapter, I wish to discuss \nthe phenomenon of 20th-century art, not in \nterms of its use of symbols, but in terms of its \nsignificance as a symbol itself—a symbolic \nexpression of the psychological condition of the \nmodern world. \nIn the following pages, I have chosen three \nrecurring motifs with which to illustrate the \npresence and nature of symbolism in the art of \nmany different periods. These are the symbols \nof the stone, the animal, and the circle—each \nof which has had enduring psychological signi­\nficance from the earliest expressions of human \nconsciousness to the most sophisticated forms of \n20th-century art. \nWe know that even unhewn stones had a \nhighly symbolic meaning for ancient and primi­\ntive societies. Rough, natural stones were often \nbelieved to be the dwelling places of spirits or \ngods, and were used in primitive cultures as \n232 \nSymbolism in the visual arts"

Their use may be regarded as \na primeval form of sculpture a first attempt to \ninvest the stone with more expressive power \nthan chance and nature could give it. \nThe Old Testament story of Jacob's dream is \na typical example of how, thousands of years \nago, man felt that a living god or a divine spirit \nwas embodied in the stone and how the stone \nbecame a symbol: \nAnd Jacob . . . went toward Haran. And he \nlighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all \nnight, because the sun was set; and he took of \nthe stones of the place, and put them for his pil­\nlows and lay down in that place to sleep. And he \ndreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the \nearth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and \nbehold the angels of God ascending and descend­\ning on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, \nand said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy \nfather, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon \nthou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. \nAnd Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, \nSurely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it \nnot. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful \nis this place! this is none other but the house of \nGod, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob \nrose up early in the morning and took the stone \nthat he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a \npillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he \ncalled the name of that place Beth-el. \nFor Jacob, the stone was an integral part of the \nrevelation. It was the mediator between himself \nand God. \nIn many primitive stone-sanctuaries, the deity \nis represented not by a single stone but by a \ngreat many unhewn stones, arranged in distinct \npatterns. (The geometrical stone alignments in \nBrittany and the stone circle at Stonehenge are \nfamous examples.) Arrangements of rough \nnatural stones also play a considerable part in \nthe highly civilized rock gardens of Zen \nBuddhism. Their arrangement is not geometri­\ncal but seems to have come about by pure \nchance. In fact, however, it is the expression of \na most refined spirituality. \nVery early in history, men began trying to \nexpress what they felt to be the soul or spirit of \na rock by working it into a recognizable form. \nIn many cases, the form was a more or less de­\nfinite approximation to the human figure—for \ninstance, the ancient menhirs with their crude \noutlines of faces, or the herms that developed \nout of boundary stones in ancient Greece, or the \nAbove left, the stone alignments \nat Carnac in Brittany, dating from \nc. 2000 B.C.—crude stones set \nupright in rows that are thought to \nhave been used in sacred rituals \nand religious processions. Left, \nrough stones resting on raked sand \nin a Zen Buddhist rock garden (in \nthe Ryoanji temple, Japan). Though \napparently haphazard, the stones' \narrangement in fact expresses a \nhighly refined spirituality. \nRight, a prehistoric  menhir —a \nrock that has been slightly carved \ninto a female form (probably a \nmother goddess). Far right, a \nsculpture by Max Ernst (born \n1891) has also hardly altered the \nnatural shape of the stone.\n\f\nmany primitive stone idols with human features. \nThe animation of the stone must be explained \nas the projection of a more or less distinct \ncontent of the unconscious into the stone. \nThe primitive tendency to give merely a hint \nof a human figure, and to retain much of the \nstone's natural form, can also be seen in \nmodern sculpture. Many examples show the \nartists\" concern with the \"self-expression\" of 'tin­\nstone; to use the language of myth, the stone is \nallowed to \"speak for itself.\" This can be seen, \nfor instance, in the work of the Swiss sculptor \nHans Aeschbacher, the American sculptor \nJames Rosati, and the German-born artist Max \nErnst. In a letter from Maloja in 1935, Ernst \nwrote: \"Alberto [the Swiss artist Giacometti] \nand I are afflicted with sculpturitis. We work \non granite boulders, large and small, from the \nmoraine of the Forno glacier. Wonderfully pol­\nished by time, frost, and weather, they are in \nthemselves fantastically beautiful. No human \nhand can do that. So why not leave the spade-\nwork to the elements, and confine ourselves to \nscratching on them the runes of our own \nmystery?\" \nWhat Ernst meant by \"mystery\" is not ex­\nplained. But later in this chapter I shall try to \nshow that the \"mysteries\" of the modern artist \nare not very different from those of the old \nmasters who knew the \"spirit of the stone.\" \nThe emphasis on this \"spirit\" in much sculp­\nture is one indication of the shifting, indefinable \nborderline between religion and art. Sometimes \none cannot be separated from the other. The \nsame ambivalence can also be seen in another \nsymbolic motif, as it appears in age-old works \nof art: the symbol of the animal. \nAnimal pictures go back to the last Ice Age \n(between 60,000 and 10,000 B.C.). They were \ndiscovered on the walls of caves in France \nand Spain at the end of the last century, but it \nwas not until early in the present century that \narchaeologists began to realize their extreme \nimportance and to inquire into their meaning. \nThese inquiries revealed an infinitely remote \nprehistoric culture whose existence had never \neven been suspected. \nEven today, a strange music seems to haunt \nthe caves that contain the rock engravings and \npaintings. According to the German art his­\ntorian Herbert Kiihn, inhabitants of the \nareas in Africa, Spain, France, and Scandinavia \nwhere such paintings are found could not be \ninduced to go near the caves. A kind of religious \nawe, or perhaps a fear of spirits hovering among \nthe rocks and the paintings, held them back. \nPassing nomads still lay their votive offerings \nbefore the old rock paintings in North Africa. \nIn the 15thcentury. Pope Calixtus 11 prohibited \nreligious ceremonies in the \"cave with the horse-\npictures.\" Which cave the pope meant is not \nknown, but there can be no doubt that it was a \ncave of the Ice Age containing animal pictures. \nAll this goes to prove that the caves and rocks \n234\n\f\nFar left, animal paintings on cave \nwalls at Lascaux The paintings \nwere not simply decorative; they \nhad a magical function. Left, a \ndrawing of a bison covered with \narrow and spear marks: The cave \ndwellers believed that by ritually \n\"killing\" the image, they would be \nmore likely to kill the animal. \nEven today the destruction of an \neffigy or statue is a symbol ic \nkilling of the person depicted. \nRight, a statue of Stalin destroyed \nby Hungarian rebels in 1956; far \nright, rebels hang a bust of the former \nStalinist Hungarian premier \nMatyas Rakosi. \nwith the animal paintings have always been \ninstinctively felt to be what they originally \nwere —religious places. The numen of the place \nhas outlived the centuries. \nIn a number of caves the modern visitor must \ntravel through low, dark, and damp passages \ntill he reaches the point where the great painted \n\"chambers\" suddenly open out. This arduous \napproach may express the desire of the primi­\ntive men to safeguard from common sight all \nthat was contained and went on in the caves, \nand to protect their mystery. The sudden and \nunexpected sight of the paintings in the cham­\nbers, coming after the difficult and awe-inspir­\ning approach, must have made an overwhelm­\ning impression on primitive man. \nThe paleolithic cave paintings consist almost \nentirely of figures of animals, whose movements \nand postures have been observed in nature and \nrendered with great artistic skill. There are, \nhowever, many details that show that the fig­\nures were intended to be something more than \nnaturalistic reproductions. Kiihn writes: \"The \nstrange thing is that a good many primitive \npaintings have been used as targets. At Monte-\nspan there is an engraving of a horse that is \nbeing driven into a trap; it is pitted with the \nmarks of missiles. A clay model of a bear in the \nsame cave has 42 holes.\" \nThese pictures suggest a hunting-magic like \nthat still practiced today by hunting tribes in \nAfrica. The painted animal has the function of \na \"double\"; by its symbolic slaughter, the \nhunters attempt to anticipate and ensure the \ndeath of the real animal. This is a form of sym­\npathetic magic, which is based on the \"reality\" \nof a double represented in a picture: What \nhappens to the picture will happen to the \noriginal. The underlying psychological fact is \na strong identification between a living being \nand its image, which is considered to be the \nbeing's soul. (This is one reason why a great \nmany primitive people today will shrink from \nbeing photographed.) \nOther cave pictures must have served magic \nfertility rites. They show animals at the \nmoment of mating; an example can be seen in \nthe figures of a male and female bison in the \nTuc d'Audubert cave in France. Thus the rea­\nlistic picture of the animals was enriched by \novertones of magic and took on a symbolic sig­\nnificance. It became the image of the living \nessence of the animal. \nThe most interesting figures in the cave \npaintings are those of semihuman beings in \nanimal disguise, which are sometimes to be \nfound besides the animals. In the Trois Freres \ncave in France, a man wrapped in an animal \nhide is playing a primitive flute as if he meant \nto put a spell on the animals. In the same cave, \nthere is a dancing human being, with antlers, a \nhorse's head, and bear's paws. This figure, dom­\ninating a medley of several hundred animals, is \nunquestionably the \"Lord of the Animals.\" \n235\n\f\nThe customs and usages of some primitive \nAfrican tribes today can throw some light on \nthe meaning of these mysterious and doubtless \nsymbolic figures. In initiations, secret societies, \nand even the institution of monarchy in these \ntribes, animals and animal disguises often play \nan important part. The king and chief are ani­\nmals too—generally lions or leopards. Vestiges \nof this custom may be discerned in the title of \nthe last emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie \n(Lion of Judah), or the honorific name of Dr. \nHastings Banda (The Lion of Malawi). \nThe further back we go in time, or the more \nprimitive and close to nature the society is, the \nmore literally such titles must be taken. A pri­\nmitive chief is not only disguised as the animal; \nwhen he appears at initiation rites in full animal \ndisguise, he is the animal. Still more, he is an \nanimal spirit, a terrifying demon who per­\nforms circumcision. At such moments he incor­\nporates or represents the ancestor of the tribe \nand the clan, and therefore the primal god \nhimself. He represents, and is, the \"totem\" \nanimal. Thus we probably should not go far \nwrong in seeing in the figure of the dancing \nanimal-man in the Trois Freres cave a kind of \nchief who has been transformed by his disguise \ninto an animal demon. \nIn the course of time, the complete animal \ndisguise was superseded in many places by ani­\nmal and demon masks. Primitive men lavished \nall their artistic skill on these masks, and many \nof them are still unsurpassed in the power and \nintensity of their expression. They are often the \nobjects of the same veneration as the god or \ndemon himself. Animal masks play a part in the \nfolk arts of many modern countries, like Switzer­\nland, or in the magnificently expressive masks \nof the ancient Japanese No drama, which is \nstill performed in modern Japan. The symbolic \nfunction of the mask is the same as that of the \noriginal animal disguise. Individual human ex­\npression is submerged, but in its place the \nwearer assumes the dignity and the beauty (and \nalso the horrifying expression) of an animal \ndemon. In psychological terms, the mask trans­\nforms its wearer into an archetypal image. \nDancing, which was originally nothing more \nthan a completion of the animal disguise by \nappropriate movements and gestures, was prob­\nably supplementary to the initiation or other \nrites. It was, so to speak, performed by demons \nin honor of a demon. In the soft clay of the Tuc \nd'Audubert cave, Herbert Kiihn found foot­\nprints that led around animal figures. They show \nthat dancing was part of even the Ice Age rites. \n\"Only heel prints can be seen,\" Kiihn writes. \n\"The dancers had moved like bisons. They had \ndanced a bison dance for the fertility and in­\ncrease of the animals and for their slaughter.\" \nIn his introductory chapter, Dr. Jung has \npointed out the close relation, or even identifi-\nFar left, a prehistoric painting from \nTrois Freres cave includes (lower \nright corner) a human figure, perhaps \na shaman, with horns and hoofs. \nAs examples of \"animal\" dances: \nleft, a Burmese buffalo dance in \nwhich masked dancers are possessed \nby the buffalo spirit; right, a \nBolivian devil dance in which the \ndancers wear demonic animal masks; \nfar right, an old southwest German \nfolk dance in which the dancers \nare disguised as witches and \nas animal-like \"wild men,\" \n236\n\f\ncation, between the native and his totem animal \n(or \"bush-soul\"). There are special ceremonies \nfor the establishment of this relationship, especi­\nally the initiation rites for boys. The boy enters \ninto possession of his \"animal soul,\" and at the \nsame time sacrifices his own \"animal being\" by \ncircumcision. This dual process admits him to \nthe totem clan and establishes his relationship \nto his totem animal. Above all, he becomes a \nman, and (in a still wider sense) a human being. \nEast Coast Africans described the uncircum-\ncised as \"animals.\" They had neither received \nah animal soul nor sacrificed their \"animality.\" \nIn other words, since neither the human nor the \nanimal aspect of an uncircumcised boy's soul \nhad become conscious, his animal aspect was \nregarded as dominant. \nThe animal motif is usually symbolic of \nman's primitive and instinctual nature. Even \ncivilized men must realize the violence of their \ninstinctual drives and their powerlessness in face \nof the autonomous emotions erupting from the \nunconscious. This is still more the case with \nprimitive men, whose consciousness is not highly \ndeveloped and who are still less well equipped \nto weather the emotional storm. In the first \nchapter of this book, when Dr. Jung is discus­\nsing the ways in which man developed the \npower of reflection, he takes an example of an \nAfrican who fell into a rage and killed his \nbeloved little son. When the man recovered \nhimself, he was overwhelmed with grief and re­\nmorse for what he had done. In this case a \nnegative impulse broke loose and did its deadly \nwork regardless of the conscious will. The ani­\nmal demon is a highly expressive symbol for \nsuch an impulse. The vividness and concrete-\nness of the image enables man to establish a \nrelationship with it as a representative of the \noverwhelming power in himself. He fears it and \nseeks to propitiate it by sacrifice and ritual. \nA large number of myths are concerned with \na primal animal, which must be sacrificed in \nthe cause of fertility or even creation. One ex­\nample of this is the sacrifice of a bull by the \nPersian sun-god Mithras, from which sprang the \nearth with all wealth and fruitfulness. In the \nChristian legend of St. George slaying the \ndragon, the primeval rite of sacrificial slaughter \nagain appears. \nIn the religions and religious art of practi­\ncally every race, animal attributes are ascribed \nto the supreme gods, or the gods are repre­\nsented as animals. The ancient Babylonians \ntranslated their gods into the heavens in the \nshape of the Ram, the Bull, the Crab, the Lion, \nthe Scorpion, the Fish, and so on — the signs of \nthe Zodiac. The Egyptians represented the god­\ndess Hathor as cow-headed, the god Amon as \nram-headed, and Thoth as ibis-headed or in the \nshape of a baboon. Ganesha, the Hindu god of \ngood fortune, has a human body but the head \n237\n\f\nof an elephant, Vishnu is a boar, Hanuman is an \nape-god, etc. (The Hindus, incidentally, do not \nassign the first place in the hierarchy of being \nto man: The elephant and lion stand higher.) \nGreek mythology is full of animal sym­\nbolism. Zeus, the father of the gods, often \napproaches a girl whom he desires in the shape \nof a swan, a bull, or an eagle. In Germanic \nmythology, the cat is sacred to the goddess \nFreya, while the boar, the raven, and the horse \nare sacred to Wotan. \nEven in Christianity, animal symbolism plays \na surprisingly great part. Three of the Evange­\nlists have animal emblems: St. Euke has the \nox, St. Mark the lion, and St. John the eagle. \nOnly one, St. Matthew, is represented as a man \nor as an angel. Christ himself symbolically \nappears as the Lamb of God or the Fish, but he \nis also the serpent exalted on the cross, the lion, \nand in rarer cases the unicorn. These animal \nattributes of Christ indicate that even the Son \nof God (the supreme personification of man) \ncan no more dispense with his animal nature \nthan with his higher, spiritual nature. The sub­\nhuman as well as the superhuman is felt to be­\nlong to the realm of the divine; the relationship \nof these two aspects of man is beautifully sym­\nbolized in the Christmas picture of the birth of \nChrist, in a stable among animals. \nThe boundless profusion of animal symbolism \nin the religion and art of all times does not \n238 \nLeft, a mask used in the ancient \nNo drama of Japan, in which the \nplayers often portray gods, spirits, \nor demons. Above right, masked \nperformers in Japanese dance theater \nBelow right, an actor in Japan's \nKabuki drama, dressed as a medieval \nhero, with mask-like make up\n\f\nmerely emphasize the importance of the sym­\nbol ; it shows how vital it is for men to integrate \ninto their lives the symbol's psychic content — \ninstinct. In itself, an animal is neither good nor \nevil; it is a piece of nature. It cannot desire \nanything that is not in its nature. To put this \nanother way, it obeys its instincts. These in­\nstincts often seem mysterious to us, but they \nhave their parallel in human life: The founda­\ntion of human nature is instinct. \nBut in man, the \"animal being\" (which lives \nin him as his instinctual psyche) may become \ndangerous if it is not recognized and integrated \nin life. Man is the only creature with the power \nto control instinct by his own will, but he is also \nable to suppress, distort, and wound it and an \nanimal, tospeak metaphorically, is never so wild \nand dangerous as when it is wounded. Sup­\npressed instincts can gain control of a man; they \ncan even destroy him. \nThe familiar dream in which the dreamer is \npursued by an animal nearly always indicates \nthat an instinct has been split off from consci­\nousness and ought to be (or is trying to be) re­\nadmitted and integrated into life. The more \ndangerous the behavior of the animal in the \ndream, the more unconscious is the primitive \nand instinctual soul of the dreamer, and the \nmore imperative is its integration into his life if \nsome irreparable evil is to be forestalled. \nSuppressed and wounded instincts are the \ndangers threatening civilized man; uninhibited \ndrives are the dangers threatening primitive \nman. In both cases the \"animal\" is alienated \nfrom its true nature; and for both, the accept­\nance of the animal soul is the condition for \nwholeness and a fully lived life. Primitive man \nmust tame the animal in himself and make it \nhis helpful companion : civilized man must heal \nthe animal in himself and make it his friend. \nOther contributors to this book have discussed \nthe importance of the stone and animal motifs \nin terms of dream and myth; I have used them \nhere only as general examples of the appearance \nof such living symbols throughout the history \nof art (and especially religious art). Let us now \nexamine in the same way a most powerful and \nuniversal symbol: the circle. \nExamples of animal symbols of \ndivinities from three religions: \nTop of page, the H indu god Ganesha \n(a painted sculpture from the \nRoyal Palace of Nepal), god of \nprudence and wisdom; above, the \nGreek god Zeus in the form of a \nswan (with Leda); right, on opposite \nsides of a medieval coin, the \ncrucified Christ shown as a man \nand as a serpent \n239\n\f\nThe symbol of the circle \nDr. M.-E. von Franz has explained the circle \n(or sphere) as a symbol of the Self. It expresses \nthe totality of the psyche in all its aspects, in­\ncluding the relationship between man and the \nwhole of nature. Whether the symbol of the \ncircle appears in primitive sun worship or \nmodern religion, in myths or dreams, in the \nmandalas drawn by Tibetan monks, in the \nground plans of cities, or in the spherical con­\ncepts of early astronomers, it always points to \nthe single most vital aspect of life its ultimate \nwholeness. \nAn Indian creation myth relates that the \ngod Brahma, standing on a huge, thousand-\npetaled lotus, turned his eyes to the four points \nof the compass. This fourfold survey from the \ncircle of the lotus was a kind of preliminary \norientation, an indispensable taking of bearings, \nbefore he began his work of creation. \nA similar story is told of Buddha. At the \nmoment of his birth, a lotus flower rose from the \nearth and he stepped into it to gaze into the 10 \ndirections of space. (The lotus in this case was \neight-rayed; and Buddha also gazed upward \nand downward, making 10 directions.) This \nsymbolic gesture of survey was the most concise \nmethod of showing that from the moment of \nhis birth, the Buddha was a unique personality, \npredestined to receive illumination. His person­\nality and his further existence were given the \nimprint of wholeness. \nThe spatial orientation performed by Brahma \nand Buddha may be regarded as symbolic of the \nhuman need for psychic orientation. The four \nfunctions of consciousness described by Dr. Jung \nin his chapter, p. 61 thought, feeling, intui­\ntion, and sensation equip man to deal with \nthe impressions of the world he receives from \nwithin and without. It is by means of these \nfunctions that he comprehends and assimilates \nhis experience; it is by means of them that he \ncan respond. Brahma's four-fold survey of the \nuniverse symbolizes the necessary integration of \nthese four functions that man must achieve. (In \nart, the circle is often eight-rayed. This expresses \na reciprocal overlapping of the four functions of \nconsciousness, so that four further intermediate \nfunctions come about — for instance, thought \ncolored by feeling or intuition, or feeling tend­\ning toward sensation.) \nIn the visual art of India and the Far East, \nthe four- or eight-rayed circle is the usual pat­\ntern of the religious images that serve as instru­\nments of meditation. In Tibetan Lamaism \nespecially, richly figured mandalas play an \nimportant part. As a rule, these mandalas repre­\nsent the cosmos in its relation to divine powers. \nBut a great many of the eastern meditation \nfigures are purely geometrical in design; these \nare calledyanlras. Aside from the circle, a very \ncommon yantra motif is formed by two inter­\npenetrating triangles, one point-upward, the \nother point-downward. Traditionally, thisshape \nSymbolizes the union of Shiva and Shakti, the \nmale and female divinities, a subject that also \nappears in sculpture in countless variations. In \nterms of psychological symbolism, it expresses \nthe union of opposites — the union of the per­\nsonal, temporal world of the ego with the \nnon-personal, timeless world of the non-ego. \nUltimately, this union is the fulfillment and goal \nof all religions: It is the union of the soul with \nGod. The two interpenetrating triangles have a \nsymbolic meaning similar to that of the more \nRight, a  yantra  (a form of mandala). \ncomposed of nine linked triangles \nThe mandala, symbolizing wholeness, \nis often connected with exceptional \nbeings of myth or legend. Far right, \na Tibetan painting of the birth of \nBuddha: in the lower left corner, \nBuddha takes his first stepson a \ncross formed of circular blossoms. \nAbove right, the birth of Alexander \nthe Great (a 16th-century manuscript \nillustration) heralded by comets— \nin circular or mandala form. \nI\"\n\f\ncommon circular mandala. They represent the \nwholeness of the psyche or Self, of which con­\nsciousness is just as much a part as the \nunconscious. \nIn both the triangle yantras and the \nsculptural representations of the union of Shiva \nand Shakti, the emphasis lies on a tension be­\ntween the opposites. Hence the marked erotic \nand emotional character of many of them. This \ndynamic quality implies a process the crea­\ntion, or coming into being, of wholeness — while \nthe four- or eight-rayed circle represents whole­\nness as such, as an existing entity. \nThe abstract circle also figures in Zen paint­\ning. Speaking of a picture entitled The Circle, \nby the famous Zen priest Sangai, another Zen \nmaster writes: \"In the Zen sect, the circle re­\npresents enlightenment. It symbolizes human \nperfection.\" \nAbstract mandalas also appear in European \nChristian art. Some of the most splendid \nexamples are the rose windows of the cathedrals. \nThese are representations of the Self of man \ntransposed onto the cosmic plane. (A cosmic \nmandala in the shape of a shining white rose \nwas revealed to Dante in a vision.) We may re­\ngard as mandalas the haloes of Christ and the \nChristian saints in religious paintings. In many \ncases, the halo of Christ is alone divided into \nlour, a significant allusion to his sufferings as \nthe Son of Man and his death on the Cross, and \nat the same time a symbol of his differentiated \nwholeness. On the walls of early Romanesque \nchurches, abstract circular figures can some­\ntimes be seen; they may go back to pagan \noriginals. \nIn non-Christian art, such circles are called \n\"sun wheels.\" They appear in rock engravings \nthat date back to the neolithic epoch before the \nwheel was invented. As Jung has pointed out, \nthe term \"sun wheel\" denotes only the external \naspect of the figure. What really mattered at \nall times was the experience of an archetypal. \n241\n\f\nLeft, an example of the mandala in \nreligious architecture: the Angkor \nWat Buddhist temple in Cambodia, \na square building with entrances at \nthe four corners. Right, the ruins \nof a fortified camp in Denmark (c. \nAD. 1000), which was laid out in \na circle - as is the fortress town \n(center right) of Palmanova, Italy \n(built in 1 593), with its star-\nshaped fortifications. Far right, \nthe streets that meet at L'Etoile, Paris, \nto form a mandala \ninner image, which Stone Age man rendered in \nhis art as faithfully as he depicted bulls, gazelles, \nor wild horses. \nMany pictorial mandalas are to be found in \nChristian art: for example, the rather rare pic­\nture of the Virgin in the center of a circular \ntree, which is the God-symbol of the burning \nbush. The most widely current mandalas in \nChristian art are those of Christ surrounded by \nthe four Evangelists. These go back to the \nancient Egyptian representations of the god \nHorus and his four sons. \nIn architecture the mandala also plays an \nimportant part but one that often passes \nunnoticed. It forms the ground plan of both \nsecular and sacred buildings in nearly all civili­\nzations; it enters into classical, medieval, and \neven modern town planning. A classical example \nappears in Plutarch's account of the foundation \nof Rome. According to Plutarch, Romulus sent \nfor builders from Etruria who instructed him by \nsacred usages and written rules about all the \nceremonies to be observed — in the same way \"as \nin the mysteries.\" First they dug a round pit \nwhere the Comitium, or Court of Assembly, now \nstands, and into this pit they threw symbolic \nofferings of the fruits of the earth. Then each \nman took a small piece of earth of the land from \nwhich he came, and these were all thrown into \nthe pit together. The pit was given the name of \nmundus (which also meant the cosmos). Around \nit Romulus drew the boundary of the city in a \ncircle with a plow drawn by a bull and a cow. \nWherever a gate was planned, the plowshare \nwas taken out and the plow carried over. \nThe city founded in this solemn ceremony \nwas circular in shape. Yet the old and famous \ndescription of Rome is urbs quadrata, the \nsquare city. According to one theory that \nattempts to reconcile this contradiction, the \nword quadrata must be understood to mean \n\"quadripartite\"; that is, the circular city was \ndivided into four parts by two main arteries \nrunning from north to south and west to east. \nThe point of intersection coincided with the \nmundus mentioned by Plutarch. \nAccording to another theory, the contradic­\ntion can be understood only as a symbol, namely \nas a visual representation of the mathematically \ninsoluble problem of the squaring of the circle, \nwhich had greatly preoccupied the Greeks and \nwas to play so great a part in alchemy. Strangely \nenough, before describing the circle ceremony \nof the foundation of the city by Romulus, \nPlutarch also speaks of Rome as Roma quad­\nrata, a square city. For him, Rome was both a \ncircle and a square. \nIn each theory a true mandala is involved, \nand that links up with Plutarch's statement that \nthe foundation of the city was taught by the \nEtruscans \"as in the mysteries,\" as a secret rite. \nIt was more than a mere outward form. By its \nmandala ground plan, the city, with its inhabi­\ntants, is exalted above the purely secular realm. \nThis is further emphasized by the fact that the \ncity has a center, the mundus, which established \nthe city's relationship to the \"other\" realm, the \nabode of the ancestral spirits. (The mundus was \ncovered by a great stone, called the \"soul stone.\" \nOn certain days the stone was removed, and \nthen, it was said, the spirits of the dead rose \nfrom the shaft.) \nA number of medieval cities were founded \non the ground plan of a mandala and were \n-' I -\n\f\nsurrounded by an approximately circular wall. \nIn such a city, as in Rome, two main arteries \ndivided it into \"quarters\" and led to the four \ngates. The church or cathedral stood at the \npoint of intersection of these arteries. The in­\nspiration of the medieval city with its quarters \nwas the Heavenly Jerusalem (in the Book of \nRevelation), which had a square ground plan \nand walls with three times four gates. But Jeru­\nsalem had no temple at its center, for God's \nimmediate presence was the center of it. (The \nmandala ground plan for a city is by no means \noutmoded. A modern example is the city of \nWashington, D.C.) \nWhether in classical or in primitive founda­\ntions, the mandala ground plan was never \ndictated by considerations of aesthetics or \neconomics. It was a transformation of the city \ninto an ordered cosmos, a sacred place bound \nby its center to the other world. And this trans­\nformation accorded with the vital feelings and \nneeds of religious man. \nEvery building, sacred or secular, that has a \nmandala ground plan is the projection of an \narchetypal image from within the human un­\nconscious onto the outer world. The city, the \nfortress, and the temple become symbols of \npsychic wholeness, and in this way exercise a \nspecific influence on the human being who \nenters or lives in the place. (It need hardly be \nemphasized that even in architecture the pro­\njection of the psychic content was a purely un­\nconscious process. \"Such things cannot be \nthought up,\" Dr. Jung has written, \"but must \ngrow again from the forgotten depths if they are \nto express the deepest insights of consciousness \nand the loftiest intuitions of thespirit, thusamal-\ngamating the uniqueness of present-day consci­\nousness with the age-old past of humanity.\") \nThe central symbol of Christian art is not the \nmandala, but the cross or crucifix. Up to Caro-\nlingian times, the equilateral or Greek cross was \nthe usual form, and therefore the mandala was \nindirectly implied. But in the course of time the \nMedieval religious architecture was \nusually based on the shape of the \ncross. Left, a 1 3th-century church \n(in Ethiopia) cut from the rock. \nRenaissance religious art shows a \nreorientation to the earth and the \nbody: Right, a plan for a circular \nchurch or basilica based on the \nbody's proportions, drawn by the \n1 5th-century Italian artist and \narchitect Francesco di Giorgio \n243\n\f\ncenter moved upward until the cross took on \nthe Latin form, with the stake and the cross­\nbeam, that is customary today. This develop­\nment is important because it corresponds to the \ninward development of Christianity up to the \nhigh Middle Ages. In simple terms, it symbo­\nlized the tendency to remove the center of man \nand his faith from the earth and to \"elevate\" it \ninto the spiritual sphere. This tendency sprang \nfrom the desire to put into action Christ's say­\ning : \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" Earthly \nlife, the world, and the body were therefore \nforces that had to be overcome. Medieval man's \nhopes were thus directed to the beyond, for it \nwas only from paradise that the promise of \nfulfillment beckoned. \nThis endeavor reached its climax in the \nMiddle Ages and in medieval mysticism. The \nhopes of the beyond found expression not only \nin the raising of the center of the cross; it can \nalso be seen in the increasing height of the \nGothic cathedrals, which seem to set the laws \nof gravity at defiance. Their cruciform ground \nplan is that of the elongated Latin cross (though \nthe baptisteries, with the font in the center, have \na true mandala ground plan). \nWith the dawning of the Renaissance, a revo­\nlutionary change began to occur in man's con­\nception of the world. The \"upward\" movement \n(which reached its climax in the late Middle \nAges) went into reverse; man turned back to \nthe earth. He rediscovered the beauties of \nnature and the body, made the first circumnavi­\ngation of the globe, and proved the world to be \na sphere. The laws of mechanics and causality \nbecame the foundations of science. The world of \nreligious feeling, of the irrational, and of mysti­\ncism, which had played so great a part in medi­\neval times, was more and more submerged by \nthe triumphs of logical thought. \nSimilarly, art became more realistic and sen­\nsuous. It broke away from the religious subjects \nof the Middle Ages and embraced the whole \nvisible world. It was overwhelmed by the mani-\nfbldness of the earth, by its splendor and horror, \nand became what Gothic art had been before \nit: a true symbol of the spirit of the age. Thus \nit can hardly be regarded as accidental that\n\f\na change also came over ecclesiastical build­\ning. In contrast to the soaring Gothic cathedrals, \nthere were more circular ground plans. The \ncircle replaced the Latin cross. \nThis change in form, however — and this is \nthe important point for the history of symbol­\nism- must be attributed to aesthetic, and not to \nreligious, causes. That is the only possible ex­\nplanation for the fact that the center of these \nround churches (the truly \"holy\" place) is \nempty, and that the altar stands in a recess in \na wall away from the center. For that reason \nthe plan cannot be described as a true man­\ndala. An important exception is St. Peter's in \nRome, which was built to ihe plans of Bra-\nmante and Michelangelo. Here the altar stands \nin the center. One is tempted, however, to \nattribute this exception to the genius of the \narchitects, for great genius is always both of and \nbeyond its time. \nIn spite of the far-reaching changes in art, \nphilosophy, and science brought about by the \nRenaissance, the central symbol of Christianity \nremained unchanged. Christ was still repre­\nsented on the Latin cross, as he is today. That \nmeant that the center of religious man re­\nmained anchored on a higher, more spiritual \nplane than that of earthly man, who had \nturned back to nature. Thus a rift arose be­\ntween man's traditional Christianity and his \nrational or intellectual mind. Since that time, \nthese two sides of modern man have never been \nbrought together. In the course of the centuries, \nwith man's growing insight into nature and its \nlaws, this division has gradually grown wider; \nand it still splits the psyche of the western \nChristian in the 20th century. \nOf course, the brief historical summary given \nhere has been over-simplified. Moreover, it \nomits the secret religious movements within \nChristianity that took account, in their beliefs, \nof what was usually ignored by most Chris­\ntians: the question of evil, the chthonic (or \nearthly) spirit. Such movements were always in \na minority and seldom had any very visible \ninfluence, but in their way they fulfilled the \nimportant role of a contrapuntal accompani­\nment to Christian spirituality. \nThe Renaissance interest in outer \nreality produced the Copernican sun-\ncentered universe (left) and turned \nartists away from \"imaginative\" art \nto nature: Below left, Leonardo's \nstudy of the human heart. \nRenaissance art — with its sensuous \nconcern with light, nature, and the \nbody (far left, a Tintoretto, 16th \ncentury) — set a pattern that lasted \nuntil the Impressionists. Below, a \npainting by Renoir (1841 -1919).\n\f\nFar left, the symbolic alchemical \nconcept of the squared circle— \nsymbol of wholeness and of \nthe union of opposites (notethe \nmale and female figures)-Left, \na modern squared circle by the \nBritish artist Ben Nicholson (born \n1894): It is a strictly geometrical, \nempty form possessing aesthetic \nharmony and beauty but without \nsymbolic meaning. \nRight, a \"sun wheel' in a painting \nby the modern Japanese artist Sofu \nTeshigahara (born 1900) follows the \ntendency of many modern painters, \nwhen using \"circular\" shapes, to make \nthem asymmetrical. \nAmong the many sects and movements that \narose about A.D. 1000, the alchemists played a \nvery important part. They exalted the mysteries \nof matter and set them alongside those of the \n\"heavenly\" spirit of Christianity. What they \nsought was a wholeness of man encompassing \nmind and body, and they invented a thousand \nnames and symbols for it. One of their central \nsymbols was the quadratura circuli (the squar­\ning of the circle), which is no more than the \ntrue mandala. \nThe alchemists not only recorded their work \nin their writings; they created a wealth of pic­\ntures of their dreams and visions —symbolic \npictures that are still as profound as they are \nbaffling. They were inspired by the dark side of \nnature — evil, the dream, the spirit of earth. \nThe mode of expression was always fabulous, \ndreamlike, and unreal, in both word and pic­\nture. The great 15th-century Flemish painter \nHieronymus Bosch may be regarded as the \nmost important representative of this kind of \nimaginative art. \nBut at the same time, more typical Renais­\nsance painters (working in the full light of day, \nso to speak) were producing the most splendid \nworks of sensuous art. Their fascination with \nearth and nature went so deep that it practi­\ncally determined the development of visual art \nfor the next five centuries. The last great repre­\nsentatives of sensuous art, the art of the passing \nmoment, of light and air, were the 19th-century \nimpressionists. \nW'e may here discriminate between two radi­\ncally different modes of artistic representation. \nMany attempts have been made to define their \ncharacteristics. Recently Herbert Kiihn (whose \nwork on the cave-paintings I have already men­\ntioned) has tried to draw a distinction between \nwhat he calls the \"imaginative\" and the \"sen­\nsory\" style. The \"sensory\" style generally de­\npicts a direct reproduction of nature or of the \npicture-subject. The \"imaginative,\" on the \nother hand, presents a fantasy or experience of \nthe artist in an \"unrealistic,\" even dreamlike, \nand sometimes \"abstract\" manner. Kiihn's two \nconceptions seem so simple and so clear that I \nam glad to make use of them. \nThe first beginnings of imaginative art go \nback very far in history. In the Mediterranean \nbasin, its efflorescence dates from the third mill­\nennium B.C. It has only recently been realized \nthat these ancient works of art are not the \nresults of incompetence or ignorance; they are \nmodes of expression of a perfectly definite reli­\ngious and spiritual emotion. And they have a \nspecial appeal today, for, during the last half-\ncentury, art has been passing once more \nthrough a phase that can be described by the \nterm \"imaginative.\" \nToday the geometrical, or \"abstract,\" symbol \nof the circle has again come to play a con­\nsiderable role in painting. But with few excep­\ntions the traditional mode of representation has \nundergone a characteristic transformation that \ncorresponds to the dilemma of modern man's ex-\n246\n\f\nistence. The circle is no longer a single mean­\ningful figure that embraces a whole world and \ndominates the picture. Sometimes the artist has \ntaken it out of its dominant position, replacing \nit by a loosely organized group of circles. Some­\ntimes the plane of the circle is asymmetrical. \nAn example of the asymmetrical circular \nplane may be seen in the famous sun disks of \nthe French painter Robert Delaunay. A paint­\ning by the modern English painter Ceri \nRichards, now in Dr. Jung's collection, contains \nan entirely asymmetrical circular plane, while \nfar to the left there appears a very much smaller \nand empty circle. \nIn the French painter Henri Matisse's Slill \nLife with Vase of Nasturtiums, the focus of \nvision is a green sphere on a slanting black \nbeam, which seems to gather into itself the \nmanifold circles of the nasturtium leaves. The \nsphere overlaps a rectangular figure, the top \nleft-hand corner of which is folded over. Given \nthe artistic perfection of the painting it is easy \nto forget that in the past these two abstract \nfigures (the circle and the square) would have \nbeen united, and would have expressed a world \nof thoughts and feelings. But anyone who does \nremember, and raises the question of meaning, \nwill find food for thought: The two figures that \nfrom the beginning of time have formed a whole \nare in this painting torn apart or incoherently \nrelated. Yet both are there and are touching \neach other. \nIn a picture painted by the Russian-born \nartist VVassily Kandinsky there is a loose assem­\nbly of colored balls or circles that seem to be \ndrifting like soap bubbles. They. too. are tenu­\nously connected with a background of one large \nrectangle with two small, almost square rect­\nangles contained in it. I n another picture, which \nhe called A Few Circles, a dark cloud (or is it a \nLeft,  Limits of Understanding  by \nPaul Klee (1879-1940) —one20th-\ncentury painting in which the \nsymbol of the circle retains a \ndominant position. \n*47\n\f\nswooping bird?) again bears a loosely arranged \ngroup of bright balls or circles. \nCircles often appear in unexpected con­\nnections in the mysterious compositions ol the \nBritish artist Paul Nash. In the primeval soli­\ntude of his landscape Event on the Downs, a \nball lies in the right foreground. Though it is \napparently a tennis ball, the design on its \nsurface forms the Tai-gi-tit, the Chinese sym­\nbol of eternity; thus it opens up a new \ndimension in the loneliness of the landscape. \nSomething similar happens in Nash's Land­\nscape from a Dream. Balls are rolling out of sight \nin an infinitely wide mirrored landscape, with \na huge sun visible on the horizon. Another ball \nlies in the foreground, in front of the roughly \nsquare mirror. \nIn his drawing Limits of Understanding, the \nSwiss artist Paul Klee places the simple figure \nof a sphere or a circle above a complex struc-\nCircles appear broken or loosely \nscattered in  The Sun and the Moon. \ntop, by Robert Delaunay (1885 \n1941); in  A Few Circles,  left, \nby Kandinsky (1866-1944); and in \nLandscape from a Dream,  right, \nby Paul Nash (1889-1946) Below, \nComposition by Piet Mondrian \n(1872-1944) is dominated by squares. \n248\n\f\nture of ladders and lines. Dr. Jung has pointed \nout thai a true symbol appears only when there \nis a need to express what thought cannot think \nor what is only divined or felt; that is the pur­\npose of Rice's simple figure at the \"limits of \nunderstanding.\" \nIt is important to note that the square, or \ngroups of rectangles and squares, or rectangles \nand rhomboids, have appeared in modern art \njust as often as the circle. The master of har­\nmonious (indeed, \"musical\" ) compositions with \nsquares is the Dutch-born artist Piet Mondrian. \nAs a rule there is no actual center in any of his \npictures, yet they form an ordered whole in \ntheir own strict, almost ascetic fashion. Still \nmore common are paintings by other artists \nwith irregular quaternary compositions, or \nnumerous rectangles combined in more or less \nloose groups. \nThe circle is a symbol of the psyche even \nPlato described the psyche as a sphere). The \nsquare 'and often the rectangle is a symbol \nofearthbound matter, of the body and reality. \nIn most modern art, the connection between \nthese two primary forms is either nonexistent, \nor loose and casual. Their separation is \nanother symbolic expression of the psychic \nstate of 20th-century man: His soul has lost \nits roots and he is threatened bv dissocia­\ntion. Even in the world situation of today \nfas Dr. Jung pointed out in his opening chap­\nter), this split has become evident: The west­\nern and eastern halves of the earth are separ­\nated by an Iron Curtain. \nBut the frequency with which the square and \nthe circle appear must not be overlooked. There \nseems to be an uninterrupted psychic urge to \nbring into consciousness the basic factors of life \nthat they symbolize. Also, in certain abstract \npictures of our time (which merely represent a \ncolored structure or a kind of \"primal matter\" ), \nthese forms occasionally appear as if they were \ngerms of new growth. \nThe symbol of the circle has played a curious \npart in a very different phenomenon of the life \nof our day, and occasionally still does so. In \nthe last years of the Second World War, there \narose the \"visionary rumor\" of round flying \nbodies that became known as \"flying saucers\" \nor IT'Os unidentified flying objects). Jung has \nexplained the UFOs as a projection of a psy­\nchic content (of wholeness that has at all times \nbeen symbolized by the circle. In other winds, \nthis \"visionary rumor,\" as can also be seen in \nmany dreams of our time, is an attempt by the \nunconscious collective psyche to heal the split in \nour apocalyptic age by means of the symbol \nof the circle. \n- 1') \nAbove, an illustration from a 1 6th \ncentury German broadsheet of some \nstrange circular objects seen in \nthe sky - similar to the \"flying \nsaucers\" that have been seen in \nrecent years. Jung has suggested \nthat such visions are projections \nof the archetype of wholeness.\n\f\nModern painting as a symbol \nThe terms \"modern art\" and \"modern paint­\ning\" are used in this chapter as the layman uses \nthem. What I will be dealing with, to use \nKiihn\"s term, is modern imaginative painting. \nPictures of this kind can be \"abstract\" (or rather \n\"non-figurative\") but they need not always be \nso. There will be no attempt to distinguish \namong such various forms as fauvism, cubism, \nexpressionism, futurism, suprematism, con­\nstructivism, orphism, and so on. Any specific \nallusion to one or the other of these groups will \nbe quite exceptional. \nAnd I am not concerned with an aesthetic \ndifferentiation of modern paintings; nor, above \nall, with artistic evaluations. Modern imagina­\ntive painting is here taken simply as a phenome­\nnon of our time. That is the only way in which \nthe question of its symbolic content can be justi­\nfied and answered. In this brief chapter it is pos­\nsible to mention only a few artists, and to \nselect a few of their works more or less at ran­\ndom. I must content myself with discussing \nmodern painting in terms of a small number of \nits representatives. \nMy starting point is the psychological fact \nthat the artist has at all times been the instru­\nment and spokesman of the spirit of his age. \nHis work can be only partly understood in \nterms of his personal psychology. Consciously \nor unconsciously, the artist gives form to the \nnature and values of his time, which in their \nturn form him. \nThe modern artist himself often recognizes \nthe interrelation of the work of art and its time. \nThus the French critic and painter Jean Baz-\naine writes in his Notes on Contemporary \nPainting: \"Nobody paints as he likes. All a \npainter can do is to will with all his might the \npainting his age is capable of.\" The German \nartist Franz Marc, who died in the First World \nWar, said: \"The great artists do not seek their \nforms in the mist of the past, but take the deep­\nest soundings they can of the genuine, pro-\nfoundest center of gravity of their age.\" And, \nas far back as 1911, Kandinsky wrote in his \nfamous essay \"Concerning the Spiritual in \nArt\": \"Every epoch is given its own measure \nof artistic freedom, and even the most creative \ngenius may not leap over the boundary of that \nfreedom.\" \nFor the last 50 years, \"modern art\" has been \na general bone of contention, and the discussion \nhas lost none of its heat. The \"yeas\" are as \npassionate as the \"nays\"; yet the reiterated \nprophecy that \"modern\" art is finished has \nnever come true. The new way of expression \nhas been triumphant to an unimagined degree. \nIf it is threatened at all, it will be because it \nhas degenerated into mannerism and modish-\nness. (In the Soviet Union, where non-figura­\ntive art has often been officially discouraged \nand produced only in private, figurative art is \nthreatened by a similar degeneration.) \nThe general public, in Europe at any rate, \nis still in the heat of the battle. The violence \nof the discussion shows that feeling runs high \nin both camps. Even those who are hostile to \nmodern art cannot avoid being impressed by \nthe works they reject; they are irritated or re­\npelled, but (as the violence of their feelings \nshows) they are moved. As a rule, the negative \nfascination is no less strong than the positive. \nThe stream of visitors to exhibitions of modern \nart, wherever and whenever they take place, \ntestifies to something more than curiosity. \nCuriosity would be satisfied sooner. And the \nfantastic prices that are paid for works of \nmodern art are a measure of the status con­\nferred upon them by society. \nFascination arises when the unconscious has \nbeen moved. The effect produced by works of \nmodern art cannot be explained entirely by \ntheir visible form. To the eye trained in \"clas­\nsic\" or \"sensory\" art,\" they are new and alien. \nNothing in works of non-figurative art reminds \nthe spectator of his own world no objects in \n250\n\f\ntheir own everyday surroundings, no human \nbeing or animal that speaks a familiar lan­\nguage. There is no welcome, no visible accord \nin the cosmos created by the artist. And yet, \nwithout any question, there is a human bond. \nIt may be even more intense than in works of \nsensory art, which make a direct appeal to feel­\ning and empathy. \nIt is the aim of the modern artist to give \nexpression to his inner vision of man, to the \nspiritual background of life and the world. The \nmodern work of art has abandoned not only \nthe realm of the concrete, \"natural,\" sensuous \nworld, but also that of the individual. It has \nbecome highly collective and therefore (even \nin the abbreviation of the pictorial hieroglyph) \ntouches not only the few but the many. What \nremains individual is the manner of represen­\ntation, the style and quality of the modern \nwork of art. It is often difficult for the layman \nto recognize whether the artist's intentions are \ngenuine and his expressions spontaneous, \nneither imitated nor aimed at effect. In many \ncases he must accustom himself to new kinds \nof line and color. He must learn them, as he \nwould learn a foreign language, before he can \njudge their expressiveness and quality. \nThe pioneers of modern art have apparently \nunderstood how much they were asking of the \npublic. Never have artists published so many \n\"manifestoes'\" and explanations of their aims \nas in the 20th century. It is, however, not only \nto others that they are striving to explain and \njustify what they are doing; it is also to them­\nselves. For the most part, these manifestoes are \nartistic confessions of faith —poetic and often \nconfused or self-contradictory attempts to give \nclarity to the strange outcome of today's artistic \nactivities. \nWhat really matters, of course, is (and \nalways has been) the direct encounter with the \nwork of art. Yet, for the psychologist who is \nconcerned with the symbolic content of modern \nart, the study of these writings is most instruc­\ntive. For that reason the artists, wherever pos­\nsible, will be allowed in the following discus­\nsion to speak for themselves. \nThe beginnings of modern art appeared in \nthe early 1900s. One of the most impressive \npersonalities of that initiatory phase was Kan-\ndinsky, whose influence is still clearly traceable \nin the paintings of the second half of the cen­\ntury. Many of his ideas have proved prophetic. \nIn his essay \"Concerning Form,\" he writes: \n\"The art of today embodies the spiritual ma­\ntured to the point of revelation. The forms of \nthis embodiment may be arranged between two \npoles: (1) great abstraction; (2) great realism. \nThese two poles open two paths, which both \nlead to one goal in the end. These two elements \nhave always been present in art; the first was ex­\npressed in the second. Today it looks as if they \nwere about to carry on separate existences. Art \nseems to have put an end to the pleasant com­\npletion of the abstract by the concrete, and \nvice versa.\" \nSensory (or representational) art \nversus imaginative (or \"unrealistic\") \nart: Right, a painting by the 19th-\ncentury British artist William \nFrith, part of a sequence depicting \na gambler's downfall.

    "raw_text": "Left and above, two compositions \nby Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948). \nHis kind of imaginative art uses \n(and transforms) ordinary  things— \nin this case, old tickets, paper, \nmetal, etc. Below left, pieces of \nwood similarly used by Hans Arp \n(1887-1 966). Below, in a sculpture \nby Picasso (1881 -1973), ordinary \nobjects —leaves—are part of the \nsubject rather than the material.\n\f\nTo illustrate Kandinsky's point that the two \nelements of art, the abstract and the concrete, \nhave parted company: In 1913, the Russian \npainter Kasimir Malevich painted a picture \nthat consisted only of a black square on a white \nground. It was perhaps the first purely \"ab­\nstract\" picture ever painted. He wrote of it: \n\"In my desperate struggle to liberate art from \nthe ballast of the world of objects, I took refuge \nin the form of the square.\" \nA year later, the French painter Marcel \nDuchamp set up an object chosen at random \n(a bottle rack) on a pedestal and exhibited it. \nJean Bazaine wrote of it: \"This bottle rack, \ntorn from its utilitarian context and washed \nup on the beach, has been invested with \nthe lonely dignity of the derelict. Good for \nnothing, there to be used, ready for anything, \nit is alive. It lives on the fringe of existence its \nown disturbing, absurd life. The disturbing \nobject that is the first step to art.\" \nIn its weird dignity and abandonment, the \nobject was immeasurably exalted and given \nsignificance that can only be called magical. \nHence its \"disturbing, absurd life.\" It became \nan idol and at the same time an object of \nmockery. Its intrinsic reality was annihilated. \nBoth Malcvich's square and Duchamp's \nbottle rack were symbolic gestures that had \nnothing to do with art in the strict sense of \nthe word. Yet they mark the two extremes \n(\"great abstraction\" and \"great realism\") be­\ntween which the imaginative art of the succeed­\ning decades may be aligned and understood. \nFrom the psychological standpoint, the two \ngestures toward the naked object (matter) and \nthe naked non-object (spirit) point to a collec­\ntive psychic rift that created its symbolic expres­\nsion in the years before the catastrophe of the \nFirst World War. This rift had first appeared \nin the Renaissance, when it became manifest as \na conflict between knowledge and faith. Mean­\nwhile, civilization was removing man further \nand further from his instinctual foundation, so \nthat a gulf opened between nature and mind, \nbetween the unconscious and consciousness. \nThese opposites characterize the psychic situa­\ntion that is seeking expression in modern art. \nThe secret soul of things \nAs we have seen, the starting point of \"the \nconcrete\" was Duchamp's famous — or notori­\nous— bottle rack. The bottle rack was not in­\ntended to be artistic in itself. Duchamp called \nhimself an \"anti-artist.\" But it brought to light \nan element that was to mean a great deal to \nartists for a long time to come. The name they \ngave to it was objel Iroiwe or \"ready-made.\" \nThe Spanish painter Joan Miro, for instance, \ngoes to the beach every dawn \"to collect things \nwashed up by the tide. Things lying there, \nwaiting for someone to discover their person­\nality.\" He keeps his finds in his studio. Now \nand then he assembles some of them and the \nmost curious compositions result: \"The artist \nis often surprised himself at the shapes of his \nown creation.\" \nAs far back as 1912, the Spanish-born artist \nPablo Picasso and the French artist Georges \nBraque made what they called \"collages\" from \nscraps of rubbish. Max Ernst cut clippings from \nthe illustrated papers of the so-called age of big \nbusiness, assembled them as the fancy took him, \nand so transformed the stuffy solidity of the \nbourgeois age into a demonic, dreamlike un­\nreality. The German painter Kurt Schwitters \nworked with the contents of his ash can: He \nused nails, brown paper, ragged scraps of news­\npaper, railway tickets, and remnants of cloth. \nHe succeeded in assembling this rubbish with \nsuch seriousness and freshness that surprising \neffects of strange beauty came about. In \nSchwitters' obsession with things, however, this \nmanner of composition occasionally became \nmerely absurd. He made a construction of \nrubbish that he called \"a cathedral built for \nthings.\" Schwitters worked on it for 10 years, \nand three stories of his own house had to be de­\nmolished to give him the space he needed. \nSchwitters' work, and the magical exaltation \nof the object, give the first hint of the place of \nmodern art in the history of the human mind, \nand of its symbolic significance. They reveal \n253\n\f\nthe tradition that was being unconsciously per­\npetuated. It is the tradition of the hermetic \nChristian brotherhoods of the Middle Ages, \nand of the alchemists, who conferred even on \nmatter, the stuff of the earth, the dignity of \ntheir religious contemplation. \nSchwitters' exaltation of the grossest material \nto the rank of art, to a \"cathedral\" (in which \nthe rubbish would leave no room for a human \nbeing), faithfully followed the old alchemical \ntenet according to which the sought-for pre­\ncious object is to be found in filth. Kandinsky \nexpressed the same ideas when he wrote: \n\"Everything that is dead quivers. Not only the \nthings of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, \nbut even a white trouser button glittering out \nof a puddle in the street .... Everything has \na secret soul, which is silent more often than it \nspeaks.\" \nWhat the artists, like the alchemists, prob­\nably did not realize was the psychological fact \nthat they were projecting part of their psyche \ninto matter or inanimate objects. Hence the \n\"mysterious animation\" that entered into such \nthings, and the great value attached even to \nrubbish. They projected their own darkness, \ntheir earthly shadow, a psychic content that \nthey and their time had lost and abandoned. \nUnlike the alchemists, however, men like \nSchwitters were not contained in and protected \nby the Christian order. In one sense, Schwit­\nters' work is opposed to it: A kind of mono­\nmania binds him to matter, while Christianity \nseeks to vanquish matter. And yet, paradoxi­\ncally, it is Schwitters' monomania that robs the \nmaterial in his creations of its inherent signifi­\ncance as concrete reality. In his pictures, matter \nis transformed into an \"abstract\" composition. \nTherefore it begins to discard its substantiality, \nand to dissolve. In that very process, these pic­\ntures become a symbolic expression of our time, \nwhich has seen the concept of the \"absolute\" \nconcreteness of matter undermined by modern \natomic physics. \nPainters began to think about the \"magic \nobject\" and the \"secret soul\" of things. The \nItalian painter Carlo Carra wrote: \"It is \ncommon things that reveal those forms of \nsimplicity through which wc can realize that \nhigher, more significant condition of being \nwhere the whole splendor of art resides.\" \nPaul Klee said: \"The object expands beyond \nthe bounds of its appearance by our knowledge \nthat the thing is more than its exterior presents \nto our eyes.\" And Jean Bazaine wrote: \"An \nobject awakens our love just because it seems \nto be the bearer of powers that are greater \nthan itself.\" \nSayings of this kind recall the old alchemical \nconcept of a \"spirit in matter,\" believed to be \nthe spirit in and behind inanimate objects like \nmetal or stone. Psychologically interpreted, this \nspirit is the unconscious. It always manifests \nitself when conscious or rational knowledge has \nreached its limits and mystery sets in, for man \ntends to fill the inexplicable and mysterious \nwith the contents of his unconscious. He pro­\njects them, as it were, into a dark, empty vessel. \nThe feeling that the object was \"more than \nmet the eye,\" which was shared by many art­\nists, found a most remarkable expression in \nthe work of the Italian painter Giorgio de \nChirico. He was a mystic by temperament, and \na tragic seeker who never found what he \nsought. On his self-portrait (1908) he wrote: \nEl quid, amabo nisi quod aenigma esl (\"And \nwhat am I to love if not the enigma?\"). \nChirico was the founder of the so-called \npillura melajisica. \"Every object,\" he wrote, \n\"has two aspects: The common aspect, which \nis the one we generally sec and which is seen \nby everyone, and the ghostly and metaphysical \naspect, which only rare individuals see at \nmoments of clairvoyance and metaphysical \nmeditation. A work of art must relate some­\nthing that does not appear in its visible form.\" \nChirico's works reveal this \"ghostly aspect\" \nof things. They are dreamlike transpositions of \nreality, which arise as visions from the uncon­\nscious. But his \"metaphysical abstraction\" is \nexpressed in a panic-stricken rigidity, and the \natmosphere of the pictures is one of nightmare \nand of fathomless melancholy. The city squares \nof Italy, the towers and objects, are set in an \nover-acute perspective, as if they were in a \nvacuum, illuminated by a merciless, cold light \n254\n\f\nAn example of \"surrealist\" art: \nLes Souliers Rouges,  by the French \npainter Rene Magntte (1898-1967) \nMuch of the disturbing effect of \nsurrealist painting comes from its \nassociation and juxtaposition of \nunrelated objects often absurd, \nirrational, and dreamlike \nfrom an unseen source. Antique heads or \nstatues of gods conjure up the classical past. \nIn one of the most terrifying of his pictures, \nhe has placed beside the marble head oi a god­\ndess a pair of red rubber gloves, a \"magic \nobject'\" in the modern sense. A green ball on the \nground acts as a symbol, uniting the crass \nopposites; without it, there would be more than \na hint of psychic disintegration. This picture was \nclearly not the result of over-sophisticated de­\nliberation ; it must be taken as a dream picture. \nChirico was deeply influenced by the philo­\nsophies of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. He \nwrote: \"Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were the \nfirst to teach the deep significance of the sense­\nlessness of life, and to show how this senseless­\nness could be transformed into art .... The \ndreadful void they discovered is the very soul­\nless and untroubled beauty of matter.\" It may \nbe doubted whether Chirico succeeded in trans­\nposing the \"dreadful void\" into \"untroubled \nbeauty.\" Some of his pictures are extremely \ndisturbing; many are as terrifying as night­\nmares. But in his effort to find artistic expres­\nsion for the void, he penetrated to the core of \nthe existential dilemma of contemporary man. \nNietzsche, whom Chirico quotes as his auth­\nority, has given a name to the \"dreadful void\" \nin his saying \"God is dead.\" Without referring \nto Nietzsche, Kandinsky wrote in On the Spiri­\ntual in Art: \"Heaven is empty. God is dead.\" \nA phrase of this kind may sound abominable. \nBut it is not new. The idea of the \"death of God\" \nand its immediate consequence, the \"meta­\nphysical void.\" had troubled the minds of 19th-\ncentury poets, especially in France and Ger­\nmany. It was a long development that, in the \n20th century, reached the stage of open discus­\nsion and found expression in art. The cleavage \nbetween modern art and Christianity was fin­\nally accomplished. \nDr. Jung also came to realize that this \nstrange and mysterious phenomenon of the \ndeath of God is a psychic fact of our time. In \n1937 he wrote: \"I know and here I am ex­\npressing what countless other people know \nthat the present time is the time of God's dis­\nappearance and death.\" For years he had ob­\nserved the Christian God-image fading in his \npatients\" dreams that is, in the unconscious of \nmodern men. The loss of that image is the loss \nof the supreme factor that gives life a meaning. \nIt must be pointed out, however, that neither \nNietzsche's assertion that God is dead, nor \nChirico's \"\"metaphysical void,\" nor Jung's de­\nductions from unconscious images, have any­\nthing final to say about the reality and exist­\nence of God or of a transcendental being or \nnot-being. They are human assertions. In each \ncase they are based, as Jung has shown in \nPsychology and Religion, on contents of the \nunconscious psyche that have entered conscious­\nness in tangible form as images, dreams, ideas, \nor intuitions. The origin of these contents, and \nthe cause of such a transformation (from a \nliving to a dead God), must remain unknown, \non the frontier of mystery. \nChirico never came to a solution ol the pro­\nblem presented to him by the unconscious. His \nfailure may be seen most clearly in his represen­\ntation of the human figure. Given the present \nreligious situation, it is man himself to whom\n\f\nBoth Giorgio de Chirico (born 1888) \nand Marc Chagall (born 1887) have \nsought to look behind the outward \nappearances of things; their work \nseems to have risen from the depths \nof the unconscious. But Chirico's \nvision (below, his  Philosopher and \nPoet) was gloomy, melancholy, even \nnightmarish. Chagall's has always \nbeen rich, warm, and alive. Right, \none of his great stained-glass \nwindows created in 1962 for a \nJerusalem synagogue \nIn Chmco's  Song of Love  (left), \nthe marble head of the goddess \nand the rubber glove are crass \nopposites The green ball seems \nto act as a uniting symbol \nRight,  Metaphysical Muse  by —Carlo \nCarra (1881 -1966) The faceless \nmanikin was a frequent theme \nof Chirico's as well. \n256\n\f\nshould be accorded a new, if impersonal, dig­\nnity and responsibility. (Jung described it as a \nresponsibility to consciousness.) But in Chirico's \nwork, man is deprived of his soul; he becomes \na mamchino, a puppet without a face (and \ntherefore also without consciousness). \nIn the various versions of his Great Meta­\nphysician, a faceless figure is enthroned on a \npedestal made of rubbish. The figure is a con­\nsciously or unconsciously ironical representation \nof the man who strives to discover the \"truth\" \nabout metaphysics, and at the same time a \nsymbol of ultimate loneliness and senselessness. \nOr perhaps the manichini (which also haunt \nthe works of other contemporary artists) are a \npremonition of the faceless mass man. \nWhen he was 40, Chirico, abandoned his/;//-\nlura metafisica; he turned back to traditional \nmodes, but his work lost depth. Here is certain \nproof that there is no \"back to where you came \nfrom\" for the creative mind whose unconscious \nhas been involved in the fundamental dilemma \nof modern existence. \nA counterpart to Chirico might be seen in \nthe Russian-born painter Marc Chagall. His \nquest in his work is also a \"mysterious and \nlonely poetry\" and \"the ghostly aspect of things \nthat only rare individuals may see.\" But Cha­\ngall's rich symbolism is rooted in the piety of \nEastern Jewish Hassidism and in a warm feel­\ning for life. He was faced with neither the pro­\nblem of the void nor the death of God. He \nwrote : \"Everything may change in our demor­\nalized world except the heart, man's love, and \nhis striving to know the divine. Painting, like \nall poetry, has its part in the divine; people \nfeel this today just as much as they used to.\" \nThe British author Sir Herbert Read once \nwrote of Chagall that he never quite crossed \nthe threshold into the unconscious, but \"has \nalways kept one foot on the earth that had \nnourished him.\" This is exactly the \"right\" re­\nlation to the unconscious. It is all the more im­\nportant that, as Read emphasizes, \"Chagall has \nremained one of the most influential artists of \nour time.\" \nWith the contrast between Chagall and Chi­\nrico, a question arises that is important for the \nunderstanding of symbolism in modern art: \nHow does the relationship between conscious­\nness and the unconscious take shape in the work \nof modern artists? Or, to put it another way, \nwhere does man stand? \nOne answer may be found in the movement \ncalled surrealism, of which the French poet \nAndre Breton is regarded as the founder. (Chi­\nrico too may be described as a surrealist.) As a \nstudent of medicine, Breton had been intro­\nduced to the work of Freud. Thus dreams came \nto play an important part in his ideas. \"Can \ndreams not be used to solve the fundamental \nproblems of life?\" he wrote. \"I believe that the \napparent antagonism between dream and re­\nality will be resolved in a kind of absolute \nreality — in surreality.\" \nBreton grasped the point admirably. What \nhe sought was a reconciliation of the opposites, \nconsciousness and the unconscious. But the way \nhe took to reach his goal could only lead him \nastray. He began to experiment with Freud's \nmethod of free association as well as with auto­\nmatic writing, in which the words and phrases \narising from the unconscious are set down with­\nout any conscious control. Breton called it: \n\"thought's dictation, independent of anv aes­\nthetic or moral preoccupation.\" \nBut that process simply means that the way \nis opened to the stream of unconscious images, \nand the important or even decisive part to be \nplayed by consciousness is ignored. As Dr. Jung \nhas shown in his chapter, it is consciousness \nthat holds the key to the values of the uncon­\nscious, and that therefore plays the decisive \npart. Consciousness alone is competent to de­\ntermine the meaning of the images and to \nrecognize their significance for man here and \nnow, in the concrete reality of the present. Only \nin an interplay of consciousness and the uncon­\nscious can the unconscious prove its value, and \nperhaps even show a way to overcome the mel­\nancholy of the void. If the unconscious, once in \naction, is left to itself, there is a risk that its con­\ntents will become overpowering or will mani­\nfest their negative, destructive side. \nIf we look at surrealist pictures (like Salvador \nDali's The Burning Giraffe) with this in mind. \n257\n\f\nwe may feel the wealth of their fantasy and the \noverwhelming power of their unconscious \nimagery, but we realize the horror and the sym­\nbolism of the end of all things that speaks from \nmany of them. The unconscious is pure nature, \nand, like nature, pours out its gifts in profusion. \nBut left to itself and without the human re­\nsponse from consciousness, it can (again like \nnature) destroy its own gifts and sooner or later \nsweep them into annihilation. \nThe question of the role of consciousness in \nmodern painting also arises in connection with \nthe use of chance as a means of composing \npaintings. In Beyond Painting Max Ernst \nwrote: \"The association of a sewing machine \nand an umbrella on a surgical table [he is \nquoting from the poet Lautreamont] is a fami­\nliar example, which has now become classical, \nof the phenomenon discovered by the surreal­\nists, that the association of two (or more) \napparently alien elements on a plane alien to \nboth is the most potent ignition of poetry.\" \nThat is probably as difficult for the layman \nto comprehend as the comment Breton made \nto the same effect: \"The man who cannot visu­\nalize a horse galloping on a tomato is an idiot.\" \nOne of the best-known of modern \n\"surrealist\" painters is Salvador \nDali (born 1904) Above, his \nfamous painting  The Burning \nGiraffe. Below, one of Max Ernst's \nfrottages (usually rubbings taken \nfrom scratches on tiles), from \nhis  Natural History. \nErnst's  Natural History  resembles \nthe interest taken in the past in \n\"accidental\" patterns in nature. \nBelow, an engraving of an 18th-\ncentury Dutch museum exhibit that \nis also a kind of surrealist \"natural \nhistory\" with its inclusion of coral, \nstones, and skeletons. \n258\n\f\n(We might recall here the \"chance\" association \nof a marble head and red rubber gloves in Chi­\nrico's picture.) Of course, many of these asso­\nciations were intended as jokes and nonsense. \nBut most modern artists have been concerned \nwith something radically different from jokes. \nChance plays a significant part in the work of \nthe French sculptor Jean (or Hans) Arp. His \nwoodcuts of leaves and other forms, thrown to­\ngether at random, were another expression of \nthe quest for, as he put it, \"a secret, primal \nmeaning slumbering beneath the world of ap­\npearances.\" He called them Leaves arranged ac­\ncording to the laws of chance and Squares arranged \naccording to the laws of chance. In these com­\npositions it is chance that gives depth to the \nwork of art; it points to an unknown but active \nprinciple of order and meaning that becomes \nmanifest in things as their \"secret soul.\" \nIt was above all the desire to \"make chance \nessential\" (in Paul Klee's words) that underlay \nthe surrealists' efforts to take the grain of wood, \ncloud formations, and so on as a starting point \nfor their visionary painting. Max Ernst, for \ninstance, went back to Leonardo da Vinci, who \nwrote an essay on Botticelli's remark that if \nyou throw a paint-soaked sponge at a wall, in \nthe splashes it makes you will see heads, animals, \nlandscapes, and a host of other configurations. \nErnst has described how a vision pursued \nhim in 1925. It forced itself on him as he was \nstaring at a tiled floor marked by thousands \nof scratches. \"In order to give foundation to my \npowers of meditation and hallucination, I made \na series of drawings of the tiles by laying sheets \nof paper on them at random and then taking \ngraphite rubbings. When I fixed my eyes on the \nresult, I was astounded by a suddenly sharpened \nsense of a hallucinatory series of contrasting and \nsuperposed pictures. I made a collection of the \nfirst results obtained from these 'frottages' and \ncalled it Hisloire Nalurelle.\" \nIt is important to note that Ernst placed over \nor behind some of these frottages a ring or \ncircle, which gives the picture a peculiar atmo­\nsphere and depth. Here the psychologist can \nrecognize the unconscious drive to oppose the \nchaotic hazards of the image's natural language \nby the symbol of a self-contained psychic whole, \nthus establishing equilibrium. The ring or circle \ndominates the picture. Psychic wholeness rules \nnature, itself meaningful and giving meaning. \nRight. Roman coins used in places \nprogressively farther away from Rome. \nOn the last coin (farthest from the \ncontrolling center) the face has dis­\nintegrated. This strangely corresponds \nto the psychic disintegration that \nsuch drugs as LSD 25 can induce. \nBelow, drawings done by an artist \nwho took this drug in a test held in \nGermany in 1951. The drawings grow \nmore abstract as conscious control \nis overcome by the unconscious. \n2 59\n\f\nIii Max Ernst's efforts to pursue the secret \npattern in things, we may detect an affinity \nwith the 19th-century Romantics. They spoke \nof nature's \"handwriting,\"' which can be seen \neverywhere, on wings, eggshells, in clouds, \nsnow, ice crystals, and other \"strange conjunc­\ntions of chance\" just as much as in dreams or \nvisions. They saw everything as the expression \nof one and the same \"pictorial language of \nnature.\" Thus it was a genuinely romantic ges­\nture when Max Ernst called the pictures pro­\nduced by his experiments \"natural history.\" \nAnd he was right, for the unconscious (which \nhad conjured up the pictures in the chance \nconfiguration of things) is nature. \nIt is with Ernst's Natural History or Arp's \ncompositions of chance that the reflections of \nthe psychologist begin. He is faced with the \nquestion of what meaning a chance arrange­\nment—wherever and whenever it comes about \n— can have for the man who happens on it. \nWith this question, man and consciousness \ncome into the matter, and with them the possi­\nbility of meaning. \nThe chance-created picture may be beautiful \nor ugly, harmonious or discordant, rich or poor \nin content, well- or ill-painted. These factors \ndetermine its artistic value, but they cannot \nsatisfy the psychologist (often to the distress of \nthe artist or of anyone who finds supreme satis­\nfaction in the contemplation of form). The psy­\nchologist seeks further and tries to understand \nthe \"secret code\" of chance arrangement -in \nso far as man can decipher it at all. The num­\nber and form of the objects thrown together at \nrandom by Arp raise as many questions as any \ndetail of Ernst's fantastic frottages. For the psy­\nchologist, they are symbols; and therefore they \ncan not only be felt but (up to a certain point) \ncan also be interpreted. \nThe apparent or actual retreat of man from \nmany modern works of art, the lack of reflection, \nand the predominance of the unconscious over \nconsciousness offer critics frequent points of \nattack. They speak of pathological art or com­\npare it with pictures by the insane, for it is \ncharacteristic of psychosis that consciousness \nand the ego-personality are submerged and \n\"drowned\" by floods of contents from the un­\nconscious regions of the psyche. \nIt is true that the comparison is not so odious \ntoday as it was even a generation ago. When \nDr. Jung first pointed out a connection of this \nkind in his essay on Picasso (1932), it provoked \na storm of indignation. Today, the catalogue of \na well-known Zurich art gallery speaks of the \n\"almost schizophrenic obsession\" of a famous \nartist, and the German writer Rudolf Kassner \ndescribed Georg Trakl as \"one of the greatest \nGerman poets,\" continuing: \"There was some­\nthing schizophrenic about him. It can be felt in \nhis work; there is a touch of schizophrenia in it \ntoo. Yes, Trakl is a great poet.\" \nIt is now realized that a state of schizo­\nphrenia and the artistic vision are not mutually \nexclusive. To my mind, the famous experiments \nwith mescalin and similar drugs have contri­\nbuted to this change of attitude. These drugs \ncreate a condition accompanied by intense \nvisions of colors and forms — not unlike schizo­\nphrenia. More than one artist of today has \nsought inspiration in such a drug.\n\f\nThe retreat from reality \nFranz Marc once said : \"The art that is coming \nwill give formal expression to our scientific con­\nviction.\" This was a truly prophetic saying. \nWe have traced the influence on artists of \nFreud's psychoanalysis and of the discovery (or \nrediscovery) of the unconscious in the early \nyears of the 20th century. Another important \npoint is the connection between modern art and \nthe results of research in nuclear physics. \nTo put it in simple, nonscientific terms, nu­\nclear physics has robbed the basic units of \nmatter of their absolute concreteness. It has \nmade matter mysterious. Paradoxically, mass \nand energy, wave and particle, have proved to \nbe interchangeable. The laws of cause and \neffect have become valid only up to a certain \npoint. It does not matter at all that these rela­\ntivities, discontinuities, and paradoxes hold \ngood only on the margins of our world only \nfor the infinitely small (the atom) and the in­\nfinitely great (the cosmos). They have caused \na revolutionary change in the concept of re­\nality, for a new. totally different, and irrational \nreality has dawned behind the reality of our \n\"natural\" world, which is ruled by the laws of \nclassical physics. \nCorresponding relativities and paradoxes \nwere discovered in the domain of the psyche. \nHere. too. another world dawned on the mar­\ngin of the world of consciousness, governed by \nnew and hitherto unknown laws that are \nstrangely akin to the laws of nuclear physics. \nThe parallelism between nuclear physics and \nthe psychology of the collective unconscious \nwas often a subject of discussion between Jung \nand Wolfgang Pauli, the Xobel prizewinner in \nphysics. The space-time continuum of physics \nand the collective unconscious can be seen, so \nto speak, as the outer and inner aspects of one \nand the same reality behind appearances. (The \nrelationship between physics and psychology \nwill be discussed by Dr. M.-L. von Franz in \nher concluding essay.) \nIt is characteristic of this one world behind \nthe worlds of physics and the psyche that its \nlaws, processes, and contents are unimaginable. \nThat is a fact of outstanding importance for \nthe understanding of the art of our time. For \nthe main subject of modern art is, in a certain \nsense, unimaginable too. Therefore much mod­\nern art has become \"abstract.\" The great artists \nof this century have sought to give visible form \nto the \"life behind things\" and so their works \nare a symbolic expression of a world behind \nThe paintings on these pages, all \nby Franz Marc (1880-1916), show \nhis gradual development away from \na concern with outward things, toward \na more completely \"abstract\" art \nFar left,  Blue Horses  (1911 ); \ncenter,  Roesina Wood  (1913-14); \nbelow,  Play of Forms  (1914),\n\f\nconsciousness (or, indeed, behind dreams, for \ndreams are only rarely non-figurative). Thus \nthey point to the \"one\" reality, the \"one\" life, \nwhich seems to be the common background of \nthe two domains of physical and psychic-\nappearances. \nOnly a few artists realized the connection be­\ntween their form of expression and physics and \npsychology. Kandinsky is one of the masters who \nexpressed the deep emotion he felt at the early \ndiscoveries of modern physical research. \"In \nmy mind, the collapse of the atom was the \ncollapse of the whole world: Suddenly the \nstoutest walls fell. Everything turned unstable, \ninsecure, and soft. I would not have been sur­\nprised if a stone had melted into thin air before \nmy eyes. Science seemed to have been annihi­\nlated.\" What resulted from this disillusion was \nthe artist's withdrawal from the \"realm of \nnature,\" from the \"populous foreground of \nthings.\" \"It seemed,\" Kandinsky added, \"as if \nI saw art steadily disengaging itself from \nnature.\" \nThis separation from the world of things \nhappened more or less at the same time to \nother artists, too. Franz Marc wrote: \"Have \nwe not learned from a thousand years of ex­\nperience that things cease to speak the more \nwe hold up to them the visual mirror of their \nappearance? Appearance is eternally flat. . . .\" \nFor Marc, the goal of art was \"to reveal un­\nearthly life dwelling behind everything, to \nbreak the mirror of life so that we may look \nbeing in the face.\" Paul Klee wrote: \"The \nartist does not ascribe to the natural form of \nLeft, Piet Mondrian's  Painting \nNo 7—an example of the modern \napproach to \"pure form\" (Mondrian's \nterm) through the use of wholly \nabstract, geometrical shapes. \nThe art of Paul Klee is a visual \nexploration and expression of the \nspirit in and behind nature—the \nunconscious or, as he termed it, the \n\"secretly perceived.\" Sometimes \nhis vision can be disturbing and \ndemonic, as in his  Death and Fire, \nright; or it can be a more poetic \nkind of fantasy, as in his  Sinbad \nthe Sailor  (far right). \nappearance the same convincing significance as \nthe realists who are his critics. He does not feel \nso intimately bound to that reality, because he \ncannot see in the formal products of nature the \nessence of the creative process. He is more con­\ncerned with formative powers than with formal \nproducts.\" Piet Mondrian accused cubism of \nnot having pursued abstraction to its logical \nend, \"the expression of pure reality.\" That can \nonly be attained by the \"creation of pure form,\" \nunconditioned by subjective feelings and ideas. \n\"Behind changing natural forms there lies \nchangeless pure reality.\" \nA great number of artists were seeking to \nget past appearances into the \"reality\" of the \nbackground or the \"spirit in matter\" by a trans­\nmutation of things —through fantasy, surreal­\nism, dream pictures, the use of chance, etc. The \n\"abstract\" artists, however, turned their backs \non things. Their paintings contained no identi­\nfiable concrete objects; they were, in Mon­\ndrian's words, simply \"pure form.\" \nBut it must be realized that what these artists \nwere concerned with was something far greater \nthan a problem of form and the distinction \nbetween \"concrete\" and \"abstract,\" figurative \naad non-figurative. Their goal was the center \nof life and things, their changeless background, \nand an inward certitude. Art had become \nmysticism. \nThe spirit in whose mystery art was sub­\nmerged was an earthly spirit, which the medi­\neval alchemists had called Mercurius. He is a \nsymbol of the spirit that these artists divined or \nsought behind nature and things, \"behind the \nPainting No. 1, 1 926.Co//ect/on. The Museum of \nModern Art, New York\n\f\nappearance of nature.\" Their mysticism was \nalien to Christianity, for that \"Mercurial\" \nspirit is alien to a \"heavenly\" spirit. Indeed, it \nwas Christianity's dark adversary that was forg­\ning its way in art. Here we begin to see the \nreal historical and symbolic significance of \n\"modern art.\" Like the hermetic movements in \nthe Middle Ages, it must be understood as a \nmysticism of the spirit of earth, and therefore as \nan expression of our time compensatory to \nChristianity. \nNo artist sensed this mystic background of \nart more clearly or spoke of it with greater \npassion than Kandinsky. The importance of the \ngreat works of art of all time did not lie, in his \neyes, \"on the surface, in externals, but in the \nroot of all roots — in the mystical content of \nart.\" Therefore he says: \"The artist's eye \nshould always be turned in upon his inner life, \nand his ear should be always alert for the voice \nof inward necessity. This is the only way of \ngiving expression to what the mystic vision \ncommands.\" \nKandinsky called his pictures a spiritual ex­\npression of the cosmos, a music of the spheres, \na harmony of colors and forms. \"Form, even \nif it is quite abstract and geometrical, has an \ninward clang; it is a spiritual being with effects \nthat coincide absolutely with that form.\" \"The \nimpact of the acute angle of a triangle on a \ncircle is actually as overwhelming in effect as \nthe finger of God touching the finger of Adam \nin Michelangelo.\" \nIn 1914, Franz Marc wrote in his Aphor­\nisms: \"Matter is a thing that man can at best \ntolerate; he refuses to recognize it. The contem­\nplation of the world has become the penetration \nof the world. There is no mystic who, in his \nmoments of sublimest rapture, ever attained \nthe perfect abstraction of modern thought, or \ntook his soundings with a deeper plummet.\" \nPaul Klee, who may be regarded as the poet \namong modern painters, says: \"It is the artist's \nmission to penetrate as far as may be toward \nthat secret ground where primal law feeds \ngrowth. Which artist would not wish to dwell \nat the central organ of all motion in space-time \n(be it the brain or the heart of creation) from \nwhich all functions derive their life? In the \nwomb of nature, in the primal ground of crea­\ntion, where the secret key to all things lies \nhidden? . . . Our beating heart drives us down­\nward, far down to the primal ground.\" What is \nencountered on this journey \"must be taken \nmost seriously when it is perfectly fused with \nthe appropriate artistic means in visible form,\" \nbecause, as Klee adds, it is not a question of \nmerely reproducing what is seen; \"the secretly \nperceived is made visible.\" Klee's work is rooted \nin that primal ground. \"My hand is entirely the \ninstrument of a more distant sphere. Nor is it \nmy head that functions in my work; it is some­\nthing else . . . .\" In his work the spirit of'na-\nture and the spirit of the unconscious became \ninseparable. They have drawn him and draw \nus, the onlookers, into their magic circle. \nKlee's work is the most complex expression \n— now poetic, now demonic — of the chthonic \nspirit. Humor and bizarre ideas build a bridge \nfrom the realm of the dark underworld to the \n263"

    "raw_text": "human world; the bond between his fantasy \nand the earth is the careful observation of the \nlaws of nature and the love for all creatures. \n\"For the artist,\" he once wrote, \"the dialogue \nwith nature is the conditio sine qua non of his \nwork.\" \nA different expression of the hidden uncon­\nscious spirit can be found in one of the most \nnotable of the younger \"abstract\" painters, \nJackson Pollock, an American who was killed \nin a car accident when he was 44. His work \nhas had a great influence on the younger artists \nof our time. In My Painting, he revealed that \nhe painted in a kind of trance: \"When I am \nin my painting I am not aware of what I am \ndoing. It is only after a sort of'get acquainted' \nperiod that I see what I have been about. I \nhave no fears about making changes, destroy­\ning the image, etc., because the painting has a \nlife of its own. I try to let it come through. It \nis only when I lose contact with the painting \nthat the result is a mess. Otherwise there is \npure harmony, an easy give and take, and the \npainting comes out well.\" \nPollock's pictures, which were painted prac­\ntically unconsciously, arc charged with bound­\nless emotional vehemence. In their lack of \nstructure they are almost chaotic, a glowing \nlava stream of colors, lines, planes, and points. \nThey may be regarded as a parallel to what the \nalchemists called the mass a confusa, the prima \nmateria, or chaos — all ways of defining the \nprecious prime matter of the alchemical pro­\ncess, the starting point of the quest for the \nessence of being. Pollock's pictures represent \nthe nothing that is everything—that is, the un­\nconscious itself. They seem to live in a time \nbefore the emergence of consciousness and be­\ning, or to be fantastic landscapes of a time \nafter the extinction of consciousness and being. \nIn the middle ol our century, the purely ab­\nstract picture without any regular order of \nforms and colors has become the most frequent \nexpression in painting. The deeper the dissolu­\ntion of \"reality,\" the more the picture loses its \nsymbolic content. The reason for this lies in the \nnature of the symbol and its function. The sym­\nbol is an object of the known world hinting at \nsomething unknown; it is the known expressing \nthe life and sense of the inexpressible. But in \nmerely abstract paintings, the world of the \nknown has completely vanished. Nothing is left \nto form a bridge to the unknown. \nOn the other hand, these paintings reveal an \nunexpected background, a hidden sense. They \noften turn out to be more or less exact images \nof nature itself, showing an astounding simi­\nlarity with the molecular structure of organic \nand inorganic elements of nature. This is a per­\nplexing fact. Pure abstraction has become an \nimage of concrete nature. But Jung may give \nus the key to understanding:\n\f\n\"The deeper layers of the psyche,\" he has \nsaid, \"lose their individual uniqueness as they \nretreat farther and fartherintodarkness. 'Lower \ndown,\" that is to say, as they approach the auto­\nnomous functional systems, they become in­\ncreasingly collective until they arc universalized \nand extinguished in the body's materiality, i.e. \nin chemical substances. The body's carbon is \nsimply carbon. Hence 'at bottom' the psyche is \nsimply 'world.' \nA comparison of abstract paintings and \nmicrophotographs shows that utter abstraction \nof imaginative art has in a secret and surpris­\ning way become \"naturalistic,\" its subject be­\ning elements of matter. The \"great abstraction\" \nand the \"great realism,\" which parted at the \nbeginning of our century, have come together \nagain. We remember Kandinsky's words: \"The \npoles open two paths, which both lead to one \ngoal at the end.\" This \"goal,\" the point of \nunion, is reached in modern abstract paintings. \nBut it is attained completely unconsciously. The \nartist's intention plays no part in the process. \nThis point leads to a most important fact \nabout modern art: The artist is, as it were, not \nso free in his creative work as he may think he \nis. If his work is performed in a more or less \nunconscious way, it is controlled by laws of \nnature that, on the deepest level, correspond to \nthe laws of the psyche, and vice versa. \nThe great pioneers of modern art gave clear-\nest expression to its true aims and to the depths \nfrom which the spirit rose that left its imprint \non them. This point is important, though later \nartists, who may have failed to realize it, did \nnot always plumb the same depths. Yet neither \nKandinsky, nor Klee, nor any other of the early \nmasters of modern painting, was ever aware of \nthe grave psychological danger he was under­\ngoing with the mystical submersion in the \nchthonic spirit and the primal ground of nature. \nThat danger must now be explained. \nAs a starting point we may take another \naspect of abstract art. The German writer Wil-\nhelm Worringer interpreted abstract art as the \nexpression of a metaphysical unease and anx­\niety that seemed to him to be more pronounced \namong northern peoples. As he explained, they \nsuffer from reality. The naturalness of the \nsouthern peoples is denied to them and they \nlong for a super-real and super-sensual world \nto which they give expression in imaginative or \nabstract art. \nBut. as Sir Herbert Read remarks in his \nConcise History of Modern Art, metaphysical \nanxiety is no longer only Germanic and north­\nern ; it now characterizes the whole of the mod­\nern world. Read quotes Klee, who wrote in \nhis Diary at the beginning of 1915: \"The more \nhorrifying this world becomes (as it is in these \ndays) the more art becomes abstract; while a \nworld at peace produces realistic art.\" To Franz \nMarc, abstraction offered a refuge from the \nevil and ugliness in this world. \"Very early in \nlife I felt that man was ugly- The animals \nseemed to be more lovely and pure, yet even \namong them I discovered so much that was re­\nvolting and hideous that my painting became \nmore and more schematic and abstract.\" \nA good deal may be learned from a conver­\nsation that took place in 1958 between the \nItalian sculptor Marino Marini and the writer \nEdouard Roditi. The dominant subject that \nMarini treated for years in many variations is \nthe nude figure of a youth on a horse. In the \nearly versions, which he described in the con­\nversation as \"symbols of hope and gratitude\" \n(after the end of the Second World War), the \nrider sits his horse with outstretched arms, his \nThe paintings of Jackson Pollock \n(left, his/Vo  23)  were painted in \na trance (unconsciously) as are the \nworks of other modern artists—such \nasthe French \"action\" painter Georges \nMathieu (far left). The chaotic but \npowerful result may be compared to \nthe  massa confusa  of alchemy, and \nstrangely resembles the hitherto \nhidden forms of matter as revealed \nin microphotographs (see p 22). \nRight, a similar configuration: \na vibration pattern made by sound \nwaves in glycerine.\n\f\nbody bending slightly backward. In the course \nof years the treatment of the subject became \nmore \"abstract.\" The more or less \"classical\" \nform of the rider gradually dissolved. \nSpeaking of the feeling underlying this \nchange, Marini said: \"If you look at my \nequestrian statues of the last 12 years in order \nof time, you will notice that the animal's panic \nsteadily increases, but that it is frozen with \nterror and stands paralyzed rather than rear­\ning or taking flight. That is all because I be­\nlieve that we are approaching the end of the \nworld. In every figure, I strove to express a \ndeepening fear and despair. In this way I am \nattempting to symbolize the last stage of a \ndying myth, the myth of the individual, vic­\ntorious hero, of the humanist's man of virtue.\" \nIn fairy tale and myth, the \"victorious hero\" \nis a symbol of consciousness. His defeat, as \nMarini says himself, means the death of the \nindividual, a phenomenon that appears in a \nsocial context as the submergence of the indi­\nvidual in the mass, and in art as the decline of \nthe human element. \nWhen Roditi asked whether Marini's style \nwas abandoning the classical canon on its way \nto becoming \"abstract,\" Marini replied, \"As \nsoon as art has to express fear, it must of \nitself depart from the classical ideal.\" He found \nsubjects for his work in the bodies excavated \nat Pompeii. Roditi called Marini's art a \"Hiro­\nshima style,\" for it conjures up visions of the \nend of a world. Marini admitted it. He felt, \nhe said, as if he had been expelled from an \nearthly paradise. \"Until recently, the sculptor \naimed at full sensual and powerful^forms. But \nfor the last 15 years, sculpture prefers forms in \ndisintegration.\" \nThe conversation between Marini and Roditi \nexplains the transformation of'sensory\" art into \nabstraction that should be clear to anyone who \nhas ever walked open-eyed through an exhibi­\ntion of modern art. However much he may \nappreciate or admire its formal qualities, he \ncan scarcely fail to sense the fear, despair, ag­\ngression, and mockery that sounds like a cry \nfrom many works. The \"metaphysical anxiety\" \nthat is expressed by the distress in these pictures \n266\n\f\nand sculptures may have arisen from the des­\npair of a doomed world, as it did with Marini. \nIn other cases, the emphasis may lie on the \nreligious factor, on the feeling that God is dead. \nThere is a close connection between the two. \nAt the root of this inner distress lies the de­\nfeat (or rather the retreat) of consciousness. In \nthe upsurge of mystical experience, everything \nthat once bound man to the human world, to \nearth, to time and space, to matter and the \nnatural living of life, has been cast aside or \ndissolved. But unless the unconscious is bal­\nanced by the experience of consciousness, it \nwill implacably reveal its contrary or negative \naspect. The wealth of creative sound that made \nthe harmony of the spheres, or the wonderful \nmysteries of the primal ground, have yielded to \ndestruction and despair. In more than one case \nthe artist has become the passive victim of the \nunconscious. \nIn physics, too, the world of the background \nhas revealed its paradoxical nature; the laws \nof the inmost elements of nature, the newly \ndiscovered structures and relations in its basic \nunit, the atom, have become the scientific foun­\ndation for unprecedented weapons of destruc­\ntion, and opened the way to annihilation. \nUltimate knowledge and the destruction of the \nworld are the two aspects of the discovery of \nthe primal ground of nature. \nJung, who was as familiar with the danger­\nous dual nature of the unconscious as with the \nTop left and center, two sculptures \nby Marino Marini (1901 -66), from \n1945 and 1951 respectively, show \nhow the theme of horse and rider \nwas altered from an expression of \ntranquility to one of tortured fear \nand despair, while the sculptures \nthemselves grew correspondingly \nmore and more abstract. Marini's later \nwork was influenced by the equally \npanic-stricken shapes of bodies \nfound at Pompeii (left). \nimportance of human consciousness, could \noffer mankind only one weapon against cata­\nstrophe: the call for individual consciousness, \nwhich seems so simple and yet is so arduous. \nConsciousness is not only indispensable as a \ncounterpoise to the unconscious, and not only \ngives the possibility of meaning to life. It has \nalso an eminently practical function. The evil \nwitnessed in the world outside, in neighbors or \nneighboring peoples, can be made conscious as \nevil contents of our own psyche as well, and \nthis insight would be the first step to a radical \nchange in our attitude to our neighbors. \nEnvy, lust, sensuality, lies, and all known \nvices are the negative, \"dark\" aspect of the un­\nconscious, which can manifest itself in two \nways. In the positive sense, it appears as a \n\"spirit of nature,\" creatively animating man, \nthings, and the world. It is the \"chthonic \nspirit\" that has been mentioned so often in this \nchapter. In the negative sense, the unconscious \n(that same spirit) manifests itself as a spirit of \nevil, as a drive to destroy. \nAs has already been pointed out, the alche­\nmists personified this spirit as \"the spirit Mercu-\nrius\" and called it, with good reason, Mercurius \nduplex (the two-faced, dual Mercurius). In the \nreligious language of Christianity, it is called \nthe devil. But, however improbable it may \nseem, the devil too has a dual aspect. In the \npositive sense, he appears as Lucifer—literally, \nthe light-bringer. \nLooked at in the light of these difficult and \nparadoxical ideas, modern art (which we have \nrecognized as symbolic of the chthonic spirit) \nalso has a dual aspect. In the positive sense it \nis the expression of a mysteriously profound \nnature-mysticism; in the negative, it can only \nbe interpreted as the expression of an evil- or \ndestructive spirit. The two sides belong to­\ngether, for the paradox is one of the basic \nqualities of the unconscious and its contents. \nTo prevent any misunderstanding, it must \nonce more be emphasized that these considera­\ntions have nothing to do with artistic and \naesthetic values, but are solely concerned with \nthe interpretation of modern art as a symbol of \nour time. \n267"

    "raw_text": "Union of opposites \nThere is one more point to be made. The \nspirit of the age is in constant movement. It is \nlike a river that flows on, invisibly but surely, \nand given the momentum of life in our century, \neven 10 years is a long time. \nAbout the middle of this century a change \nbegan to come over painting. It was nothing \nrevolutionary, nothing like the change that \nhappened about 1910, which meant the recon­\nstruction of art to its very foundations. But \nthere were groups of artists who formulated \ntheir aims in ways not heard before. This trans­\nformation is going on within the frontiers of \nabstract painting. \nThe representation of concrete reality, which \nsprings from the primal human need of catch­\ning the passing moment on the wing, has be­\ncome a truly concrete sensuous art in the photo­\ngraphy of such men as France's Henri Cartier-\nBresson, Switzerland's Werner Bischof, and \nothers. We can therefore understand why artists \ncontinued on their own way of inwardness and \nimagination. For a good many of the young \nartists, however, abstract art as it had been \npracticed for many years offered no adventure, \nno field of conquest. Seeking the new, they \nfound it in what lay nearest, yet had been lost \n— in nature and man. They were not and are \nnot concerned with the reproduction of nature \nin pictures, but with the expression of their own \nemotional experience of nature. \nThe French painter Alfred Manessier defined \nthe aims of his art in these words: \"What we \nhave to reconquer is the weight of lost reality. \nWe must make for ourselves a new heart, a new \nspirit, a new soul, in the measure of man. The \npainter's true reality lies neither in abstraction \nnor in realism, but in the reconquest of his \nweight as a human being. At present non-fig­\nurative art seems to me to offer the one oppor­\ntunity for the painter to approach the inward \nreality of himself and to grasp the consciousness \nof his essential self, or even of his being. It is \nonly by the rcconquest of his position, I believe, \nthat the painter will be able, in the time to \ncome, to return slowly to himself, to rediscover \nhis own weight and so to strengthen it that it \ncan even reach the outward reality of the \nworld.\" \nJean Bazaine speaks in similar terms: \"It is \na great temptation for the painter of today to \npaint the pure rhythm of his feeling, the most \nsecret pulse of his heart, instead of embodying \nit in a concrete form. That, however, leads only \nto a desiccated mathematics or a kind of ab­\nstract expressionism, which ends in monotony \nand a progressive impoverishment of form. . . . \nBut a form that can reconcile man with his \nworld is an 'art of communion' by which man, \nat any moment, can recognize his own un­\nformed countenance in the world.\" \nWhat in fact artists now have at heart is a \nconscious reunion of their own inward reality \nwith the reality of the world or of nature; or, \nin the last resort, a new union of body and soul, \nmatter and spirit. That is their way to the \"re-\nconquest of their weight as human beings.\" \nOnly now is the great rift that set in with \nmodern art (between \"great abstraction\" and \n\"great realism\") being made conscious and on \nthe way to being healed. \nFor the onlooker, this first becomes evident \nin the changed atmosphere in the works of these \nartists. There radiates from the pictures of such \nartists as Alfred Manessier or the Belgian-born \npainter Gustave Singier, in spite of all abstrac­\ntion, a belief in the world, and, in spite of all \nintensity of feeling, a harmony of forms and \ncolors that often attains serenity. In the French \npainter Jean Lurcat's famous tapestries of the \n268 \nIn this century the depiction of \nactuality—once the province of \nthe painter and sculptor—has been \ntaken over by the photographer, \nwhose camera can not only record \nbut (like any landscape painting \nof past centuries) can express the \nphotographer's own emotional \nexperience of the subject. Right, a \nJapanese scene photographed \nby Werner Bischof (1916-54).\n\f\n\n\f\n1950s the exuberance of nature pervades the \npicture. His art could be called sensuous as well \nas imaginative. \nWe find a serene harmony of forms and col­\nors also in the work of Paul Klee. This har­\nmony was what he had always been striving \nfor. Above all, he had realized the necessity \nof not denying evil. \"Even evil must not be a \ntriumphant or degrading enemy, but a power \ncollaborating in the whole.\" But Klee's starting \npoint was not the same. He lived near \"the \ndead and the unborn\" at an almost cosmic dis­\ntance from this world, while the younger gen­\neration of painters can be said to be more \nfirmly rooted in earth. \nAn important point to notice is that modern \npainting, just when it has advanced far enough \nto discern the union of the opposites, has taken \nup religious themes. The \"metaphysical void\" \nseems to have been overcome. And the utterly \nunexpected has happened: The Church has be­\ncome a patron of modern art. We need only \nmention here All Saints at Basle, with windows \nby Alfred Manessier; Assy church, with pic­\ntures by a large number of modern artists; the \nMatisse chapel at Vence; and the church at \nAudincourt, which has works by Jean Bazaine \nand the French artist Fernand Leger. \nThe admission of modern art to the Church \nmeans more than an act of broadmindedness \non the part of its patrons. It is symbolic of the \nfact that the part played by modern art in re­\nlation to Christianity is changing. The compen­\nsatory function of the old hermetic movements \nhas made way for the possibility of collabora­\ntion. In discussing the animal symbols of Christ, \nit was pointed out that the light and the chtho-\nnic spirits belonged to each other. It seems as \nif the moment had come today when a new \nstage in the solution of this millennial problem \nmight be reached. \nWhat the future will yield we cannot know — \nwhether the bridging of the opposites will give \npositive results, or whether the way will lead \nthrough yet more unimaginable catastrophes. \nThere is too much anxiety and too much dread \nat work in the world, and this is still the pre­\ndominant factor in art and society. Above all, \nthere is still too much unwillingness on the part \nof the individual to apply to himself and his \nlife the conclusions that can be drawn from art, \nalthough he might be ready to accept them in \nart. The artist can often express many things, \nunconsciously and without awakening hostility, \nwhich are resented when they are expressed by a \npsychologist (a fact that could be demonstrated \neven more conclusively in literature than in the \nvisual arts). Confronted by the statements of the \npsychologist, the individual feels directly chal­\nlenged; but what the artist has to say, particu-\n270\n\f\nlarly in our century, usually remains in an \nimpersonal sphere. \nAnd yet it seems important that the sug­\ngestion of a more whole, and therefore more \nhuman, form of expression should have be­\ncome visible in our time. It is a glimmer of \nhope, symbolized for me (at the time of writ­\ning: 1961) by a number of paintings by the \nFrench artist Pierre Soulages. Behind a cataract \nof huge, black rafters there glimmers a clear, \npure blue or a radiant yellow. Light is dawn­\ning behind darkness. \nMid-20th-century art seems to be \nmoving away from a Marini-like \ndespair—as is seen in the gesture \nof Jean Lurcat, who exhibited his \nwork in a field (top left), a link \nwith nature and the earth. Above, \nDedicace a Sainte Marie Madeleine \nby Alfred Manessier (born 1911). \nTop right,  Pour la Naissance du \nSurhomme by France's Pierre-Yves \nTremois (born 1921) Both works \nindicate a tendency toward life and \nwholeness. The painting, right, by \nPierre Soulages (born 1919) might \nbe understood as a symbol of hope: \nBehind the cataclysmic darkness \ncan be seen a glimmer of light.\n\f\nSymbols in an individual analysis \nJolande Jacob! \nA 1 7th-century engraving of \"The Palace of Dreams.\" \ni"

    "raw_text": "The beginning of the analysis \nThere is a widespread belief that the methods \nof Jungian psychology are applicable only to \nmiddle-aged people. True, many men and \nwomen reach middle age without achieving \npsychological maturity, and it is therefore \nnecessary to help them through the neglected \nphases of their development. They have not \ncompleted the first part of the process of indi­\nviduation that Dr. M.-L. von Franz has de­\nscribed. But it is also true that a young person \ncan encounter serious problems as he grows up. \nIf a young person is afraid of life and finds it \nhard to adjust to reality, he might prefer to \ndwell in his fantasies or to remain a child. In \nsuch a young person (especially if he is intro­\nverted) one can sometimes discover unexpected \ntreasures in the unconscious, and by bringing \nthem into consciousness strengthen his ego and \ngive him the psychic energy he needs to grow \ninto a mature person. That is the function of \nthe powerful symbolism of our dreams. \nOther contributors to this book have de­\nscribed the nature of these symbols and the role \nthey play in man's psychological nature. I wish \nto show how analysis can aid the individuation \nprocess by taking the example of a young en­\ngineer, aged 25, whom I shall call Henry. \nHenry came from a rural district in eastern \nSwitzerland. His father, of Protestant peasant \nstock, was a general practitioner: Henry de­\nscribed him as a man with high moral standards, \nbut a rather withdrawn person who found it \ndifficult to relate to other people. He was more \nof a father to his patients than to his children. \nAt home, Henry's mother was the dominant \npersonality. \"We were raised by the strong \nhand of our mother,\" he said on one occasion. \nShe came from a family with an academic \nbackground and wide artistic interests. She her­\nself, in spite of her strictness, had a broad spiri­\ntual horizon; she was impulsive and romantic \n(she had a great love for Italy). Though she was \nby birth a Catholic, her children had been \nbrought up in the Protestantism of their father. \nHenry had a sister, older than himself, with \nwhom he had a good relationship. \nHenry was introverted, shy, finely drawn, \nand very tall, with light hair, a high pale fore­\nhead, and blue eyes with dark shadows. He did \nnot think that neurosis (the most usual reason) \nhad brought him to me, but rather an inner \nurge to work on his psyche. A strong mother-\ntie, however, and a fear of committing himself \nto life were hidden behind this urge; but these \nwere only discovered during the analytical work \nwith me. He had just completed his studies and \ntaken a position in a large factory, and he was \nfacing the many problems of a young man on \nthe threshold of manhood. \"It appears to me,\" \nhe wrote in a letter asking for an interview, \n\"that this phase of my life is particularly im­\nportant and meaningful. I must decide either \nto remain unconscious in a well-protected secu­\nrity, or else to venture on a yet unknown way \nof which I have great hopes.\" The choice thus \nconfronting him was whether to remain a \nlonely, vacillating, and unrealistic youth or to \nbecome a self-sufficient and responsible adult. \nHenry told me that he preferred books to \nsociety; he felt inhibited among people, and \nwas often tormented by doubts and self-criti­\ncism. He was well read for his age and had a \nleaning toward aesthetic intellectualism. After \nan earlier atheistic stage, he became rigorously \nProtestant, but finally his religious attitude \nbecame completely neutral. He had chosen a \ntechnical education because he felt his talents \nlay in mathematics and geometry. He possessed \na logical mind, trained in the natural sciences, \nbut he also had a propensity toward the irra­\ntional and mystical that he did not want to \nadmit even to himself. \nAbout two years before his analysis began, \nHenry had become engaged to a Catholic girl \nfrom the French part of Switzerland. He de­\nscribed her as charming, efficient, and full of \n274 \nSymbols in an individual analysis\n\f\ninitiative. Nevertheless, he was uncertain \nwhether he should undertake the responsibility \nof marriage. Since he had so little acquaintance \nwith girls, he thought it might be better to wait, \nor even to remain a bachelor dedicated to a \nscholarly life. His doubts were strong enough \nto prevent his reaching a decision; he needed \na further step toward maturity before he could \nfeel sure of himself. \nAlthough qualities of both'his parents were \ncombined in Henry, he was markedly mother-\nbound. In his consciousness,'he was identified \nwith his real (or \"light\") mother, who repre­\nsented high ideals and intellectual ambitions. \nBut in his unconscious he was deeply in the \npower of the dark aspects of his mother-bound \ncondition. His unconscious still held his ego in \na strangle-hold. All his clear-cut thinking and \nhis efforts to find a firm standpoint in the \npurely rational remained nothing more than an \nintellectual exercise. \nThe need to escape from this \"mother-\nprison\" was expressed in hostile reactions to his \nreal mother and a rejection of the \"inner \nmother\" as a symbol of the feminine side of the \nunconscious. But an inner power sought to \nhold him back in the condition of childhood, \nresisting everything that attracted him to the \noutside world. Even the attractions of his \nfiancee were not enough to free him from his \nmother-ties, and thus help him find himself. He \nwas not aware that his inner urge for growth \n(which he felt strongly) included the need to \ndetach himself from his mother. \nMy analytical work with Henry lasted nine \nmonths. Altogether, there were 35 sessions in \nwhich he presented 50 dreams. So short an \nanalysis is rare. It is only possible when energy-\nladen dreams like Henry's speed up the process \nof development. Of course, from the Jungian \npoint of view, there is no rule for the length of \ntime required for a successful analysis. All de­\npends on the individual's readiness to realize \ninner facts and on the material presented by \nhis unconscious. \nLike most introverts, Henry led a rather \nmonotonous outer life. During the day he was \ncompletely involved in his job. In the evenings \nhe sometimes went out with his fiancee or with \nfriends, with whom he liked to have literary \ndiscussions. Quite often he sat in his lodgings \nabsorbed in a book or in his own thoughts. \nThough we regularly discussed the happenings \nof his daily life, and also his childhood and \nyouth, we usually got fairly quickly to the in­\nvestigation of his dreams and the problems his \ninner life presented to him.

    "raw_text": "plosive the dreamer's dream symbols may be \nfor him. The analyst can hardly be too careful \nand reserved. If too bright a light is thrown on \nthe dream-language of symbols, the dreamer \ncan be driven into anxiety, and thus led into \nrationalization as a defense mechanism. Or he \ncan no longer assimilate them, and can fall into \na severe psychic crisis. Also, the dreams re­\nported and commented on here arc by no \nmeans all the dreams that Henry had during \nhis analysis. I can discuss only an important \nfew that influenced his development. \nIn the beginning of our work, childhood \nmemories with important symbolic meanings \ncame up. The oldest dated back to Henry's \nfourth year. He said: \"One morning I was \nallowed to go with my mother to the baker's \nshop and there I received a crescent roll from \nthe baker's wife. I did not eat the roll but \ncarried it proudly in my hand. Only my mother \nand the baker's wife were present, so I was the \nonly man.\" Such crescents are popularly called \n\"moon-teeth,\" and this symbolic allusion to the \nmoon underlines the dominating power of the \nfeminine a power to which the little boy may \nhave felt exposed and which, as the \"only \nman,\" he was proud of being able to confront. \nAnother childhood memory came from his \nfifth year. It concerned Henry's sister, who \ncame home after her examinations at school \nand found him constructing a toy barn. The \nbarn was made with blocks of wood arranged \nin the form of a square and surrounded with \na kind of hedge that looked like the battle­\nments of a castle. Henry was pleased with his \nachievement, and said teasingly to his sister: \n\"You have started school but you're already on \nholiday.\" Her reply, that he was on holiday all \nyear, upset him terribly. He felt deeply hurt \nthat his \"achievement\" was not taken seriously. \nEven years later Henry had not forgotten \nthe bitter hurt and injustice that he had felt \nwhen his construction was rejected. His later \nproblems concerning the assertion of his mas­\nculinity and the conflict between rational and \nfantasy values are already visible in this early \nexperience. And these problems are also to be \nseen in the images of his first dream. \n276\n\f\nThe initial dream \nThe day after Henry's first visit to me, he had \nthe following dream: \nI was on an excursion with a group of people \nI did not know. We were going to the Zinalrot-\nhorn. We had started from Samaden. We only \nwalked about an hour because we were to camp \nand have some theatricals. I was not given an \nactive part. I especially remember one performer \n—a young woman in a pathetic role wearing a long \nflowing robe. \nIt was midday and I wanted to go on to the \npass. As all the others preferred to remain, I went \nup alone, leaving my equipment behind. How­\never, I found myself right back in the valley and \ncompletely lost my orientation. I wanted to re­\nturn to my party but did not know which moun­\ntainside I should climb. I was hesitant about ask­\ning. Finally, an old woman showed me the way \nI must go. \nThen I ascended from a different starting \npoint than our group had used in the morning. \nIt was a matter of making a turn at the right \naltitude and then following the mountain slope \nto return to the party. I climbed 'along a cog­\nwheel mountain railway on the right side. On my \nleft little cars constantly passed me, each con­\ntaining one hidden bloated little man in a blue \nsuit. It is said they are dead. I was afraid of other \ncars coming from behind and kept turning around \nto look, so as not to be run over. My anxiety was \nneedless. \nAt the point where I had to turn off. to the \nright, there were people awaiting me. They took \nme to an inn. A cloudburst came up. I regretted \nthat my equipment my rucksack, and my motor \nbike—were not there, but I was told not to get \nthem till next morning. I accepted the advice. \nOne of Henry's childhood memories \ninvolved a crescent roll, which he \ndrew (top left). Center, the same \nshape on a modern Swiss bakery sign. \nThe crescent shape has long been \nlinked with the moon and thus with \nthe feminine principle, as in the \ncrown (left) of the goddess Ishtar \nof third-century B.C. Babylon. \nDr. Jung assigned great importance to the \nfirst dream in an analysis, for, according to \nhim, it often has anticipatory value. A deci­\nsion to go into analysis is usually accompanied \nby an emotional upheaval that disturbs the \ndeep psychic levels from which archetypal sym­\nbols arise. The first dreams therefore often \npresent \"collective images\" that provide a per­\nspective for the analysis as a whole and can \ngive the therapist insight into the dreamer's \npsychic conflicts. \nWhat does the above dream tell us of Henry's \nfuture development? We must first examine \nsome of the associations that Henry himself sup­\nplied. The village of Samaden had been the \nhome of Jiirg Jenatsch, a famous 17th-century \nSwiss freedom-fighter. The \"theatricals\" called \nup the thought of Goethe's Wilhelm Meisters \nLehrjahre, which Henry liked very much. In \nthe woman he saw a resemblance to the figure \nin a painting called The Island of Ihe Dead by \nthe 19th-century Swiss artist Arnold Bocklin. \nThe \"wise old woman,\" as he called her, \nseemed to be associated on the one hand to \nhis analyst, on the other to the charwoman in \nJ. B. Priestley's play They Came to a City. The \ncog-wheel railway reminded him of the barn \n(with battlements) that he had built as a child. \nThe dream describes an \"excursion\" (a sort \nof \"walking tour\"), which is a striking parallel \nto Henry's decision to undertake analysis. The \nindividuation process is often symbolized by a \nvoyage of discovery to unknown lands. Such \na voyage takes place in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's \nProgress, or in Dante's Divina Commedia. The \n\"traveler\" in Dante's poem, searching for a \nway, comes to a mountain that he decides to \nclimb. But because of three strange animals (a \nmotif that will also appear in one of Henry's \nlater dreams) he is forced to descend into the \nvalley and even into hell. (Later he ascends \nagain to purgatory and finally reaches para­\ndise.) From this parallel one could deduce that \n277\n\f\nThe initial stage of the process of \nindividuation can sometimes be a \nperiod of disorientation—as was the \ncase with Henry. Left, the first \nwoodcut from the 1 5th century book \nThe Dream of Poliphilo  shows the \ndreamer fearfully entering a dark \nwood —perhaps representing his \nentrance into the unknown. \nAssociations produced by Henry \nto his first dream: right,  Island \nof the Deadby  the 19th-century \nSwiss artist Arnold Bocklin. Far \nright, a scene from the 1944 London \nproduction of J. B. Priestley's  They \nCame to a City,  which concerns the \nreactions of a group of people from \nmany walks of life to an \"ideal \ncity.\" One of the central characters \nis a charwoman, left of picture. \nthere might be a similar period of disorienta­\ntion and lonely seeking in store for Henry. The \nfirst part of this life-journey, represented as \nclimbing a mountain, offers ascent from the \nunconscious to an elevated point of view of the \nego i.e. to an increased consciousness. \nSamaden is named as the starting point of \nthe excursion. This is where Jenatsch (whom \nwe may take as embodying the \"freedom-seek­\ning\" sense within Henry's unconscious) started \nhis campaign for the liberation of the Veltlin \nregion of Switzerland from the French. \nJenatsch had other characteristics in common \nwith Henry: He was a Protestant who fell in \nlove with a Catholic girl; and, like Henry, \nwhose analysis was to free him from his mother-\nties and from fear of life, Jenatsch also fought \nfor liberation. One could interpret this as a \nfavorable augury for the success of Henry's own \nfight for freedom. The goal of the excursion is \nthe Zinalrothorn, a mountain in western Swit­\nzerland that he did not know. The word rol \n(\"red\") in Zinalro/horn touches on Henry's \nemotional problem. Red is usually symbolic of \nfeeling or passion; here it points to the value \nof the feeling-function, which was insufficiently \ndeveloped in Henry. And the word \"horn\" \nreminds one of the crescent roll in the baker's \nshop of Henry's childhood. \nAfter a short walk, a halt is called, and \nHenry can return to a state of passivity. This \nalso belongs to his nature. The point is under­\nlined by the \"theatricals.\" Attending the theatre \n(which is an imitation of real life) is a popular \nway of evading an active part in life's drama. \nThe spectator can identify with the play, yet \ncontinue to pander to his fantasies. This kind \nof identification permitted the Greeks to experi­\nence catharsis, much as the psycho-drama initi­\nated by the American psychiatrist J. L. Moreno \nis now used as a therapeutic aid. Some such \nprocess may have enabled Henry to undergo \nan inner development when his associations \nraised memories of Wilhelm Meisler, Goethe's \nstory of the maturing of a young man. \nThat Henry should have been impressed by \nthe romantic appearance of a woman is also \nnot surprising. This figure resembles Henry's \nmother and is at the same time a personifica­\ntion of his own unconscious feminine side. The \nconnection Henr\\ makes between her and \nBocklin's Island of Ihe Dead points to his de­\npressive mood, so well expressed by the painting, \nwhich shows a white-robed priest-like figure \nsteering a boat bearing a coffin toward an \nisland. We have here a significant double \nparadox: The keel of the boat seems to sug­\ngest a contrary course, away from the island; \nand the \"priest\" is a figure of uncertain sex. \nIn Henry's associations, this figure is certainly \nhermaphroditic. The double paradox coincides \nwith Henry's ambivalence: The opposites in \n278\n\f\nhis soul are still too undifferentiated to be \nclearly separated. \nAfter this interlude in the dream. Henry \nsuddenly becomes aware that it is noon and \nhe must go on. So he again starts for the pass. \nA mountain pass is a well-known symbol for a \n\"situation of transition\" that leads from an old \nattitude of mind to a new one. Henry must go \nalone; it is essential for his ego to surmount \nthe test unaided. Thus he leaves his kit behind \nan action that signifies that his mental equip­\nment has become a burden, or that he must \nchange his normal way of going about things. \nBut he does not reach the pass. He loses his \nbearings and finds himself back in the valley. \nThis failure shows that while Henry's ego de­\ncides on activity, his other psychic entities (re­\npresented by the other members of the party) \nremain in the old state of passivity and refuse \nto accompany the ego. (When the dreamer \nhimself appears in a dream, he usually repre­\nsents only his conscious ego; the other figures \nstand for his more or less unknown, uncon­\nscious qualities.) \nHenry is in a situation where he is helpless, \nyet ashamed to admit it. At this moment he \nmeets an old woman who indicates the right \nway to him. He can do nothing but accept \nher advice. The helpful \"old woman\" is a \nwell-known symbol in myths and fairy talcs for \nthe wisdom of the eternal female nature. The \nrationalist Henry hesitates to accept her help \nbecause such acceptance requires a sacrificium \nintelleclus—a sacrifice, or discarding, of a \nrational way of thought. (This demand will \noften be made of Henry in later dreams.) Such \na sacrifice is unavoidable; it applies to his \nrelationship with the analysis as well as with \neveryday life. \nHe associated the figure of the \"old woman\" \nto the charwoman in Priestley's play about a \nnew \"dream\" city (perhaps an analogy to the \nNew Jersusalem of the Apocalypse) into which \nthe characters can enter only after a kind of \ninitiation. This association seems to show that \nHenry had intuitively recognized this confron­\ntation as something decisive for him. The char­\nwoman in Priestley's play says that in the city \n\"they have promised me a room of my own.\" \nThere she will be self-reliant and independent, \nas Henry seeks to be. \nIf such a technically minded young man as \nHenry is consciously to choose the way of \npsychic development, he must be prepared for \na reversal of his old attitudes. Therefore, on the \nadvice of the woman, he must start his climb \nfrom a different spot. Only then will it be pos­\nsible for him to judge at what level he must \ndeviate to reach the group — the other qualities \nof his psyche that he had left behind. \n1 le climbs a cog-wheel rail\\va\\ track a motif \nperhaps reflecting his technical education) and \n*79\n\f\nkeeps to the right side of the track —which is \nthe conscious side. (In the history of symbolism, \nthe right side generally represents the realm of \nconsciousness; the left, the unconscious.) From \nthe left, little cars are coming down, and in \neach a little man is hidden. Henry is afraid that \nan unnoticed upward-bound car might hit him \nfrom the rear. His anxiety proves groundless, \nbut it reveals that Henry is afraid of what, so \nto speak, lies behind his ego. \nThe bloated, blue-clothed men might sym­\nbolize sterile intellectual thoughts that are be­\ning brought down mechanically. Blue often \ndenotes the function of thinking. Thus the \nmen might be symbols of ideas or attitudes that \nhave died on the intellectual heights where the \nair is too thin. They could also represent life­\nless inner parts of Henry's psyche. \nA comment on these men is made in the \ndream: \"It is said they are dead.\" But Henry \nis alone. Who makes this statement? It is a \nvoice — and when a voice is heard in a dream it \nis a most meaningful occurrence. Dr. Jung \nidentified the appearance of a voice in dreams \nwith an intervention of the Self. It stands for a \nknowledge that has its roots in the collective \nfundaments of the psyche. What the voice says \ncannot be disputed. \nThe insight Henry has gained about the \n\"dead\" formulas, to which he has been too \ncommitted, marks a turning point in the dream. \nHe has at last reached the right place for tak­\ning a new direction, to the right (the conscious \ndirection), toward the conscious and the outer \nworld. There he finds the people he left behind \nwaiting for him; and thus he can become con­\nscious of previously unknown aspects of his per­\nsonality. Since his ego has surmounted the \ndangers it confronted alone (an accomplish­\nment that could make him more mature and \nstable), he can rejoin the group or \"collective\" \nand get shelter and food. \nThen comes the rain, a cloudburst that re­\nlaxes tension and makes the earth fertile. In \nmythology, rain was often thought to be a \n\"love-union\" between heaven and earth. In the \nEleusinian mysteries, for instance, after every­\nthing had been purified by water, the call went \nup to heaven: \"Let it rain!\" and down to \nLeft, the Greek maiden Danae, who \nwas impregnated by Zeus in the form \nof a shower of gold (from a painting \nby the 1 6th century Flemish artist \nJan Gossaert) Like Henry's dream, \nthis myth reflects the symbolism of \nthe cloudburst as a sacred marriage \nbetween heaven and earth. \nIn another of Henry's dreams a doe \nappears - an image of shy femininity \nas is the fawn in the painting, \nright, by the 19th century British \nartist Edwin Landseer\n\f\nearth: \"Be fruitful!\" This was understood as \na sacred marriage of the gods. In this way rain \ncan be said to represent a \"solution\" in the \nliteral sense of the word. \nComing down, Henry again meets the col­\nlective values symbolized by the rucksack and \nmotorcycle. He has passed through a phase in \nwhich he has strengthened his ego-conscious­\nness by proving he can hold his own, and he \nhas a renewed need for social contact. However, \nhe accepts the suggestion of his friends that he \nshould wait and fetch his things the next morn­\ning. Thus he submits for the second time to \nadvice that comes from elsewhere: the first \ntime, to the advice of the old woman, to a \nsubjective power, an archetypal figure; the \nsecond time, to a collective pattern. With this \nstep Henry has passed a milestone on the road \nto maturity. \nAs an anticipation of the inner development \nthat Henry could hope to achieve through \nanalysis, this dream was extraordinarily pro­\nmising. The conflicting opposites that kept \nHenrys soul in tension were impressively sym­\nbolized. On the one hand, there was his con­\nscious urge to ascend, and on the other his \ntendency to passive contemplation. Also, the \nimage of the pathetic young woman in her \nwhite robes (representing Henry's sensitive and \nromantic feelings) contrasts with the bloated \ncorpses in blue suits (representing his sterile in­\ntellectual world). However, to overcome these \nobstacles and bring about a balance between \nthem would be possible for Henry only after the \nmost severe trials. \nFear of the unconscious \nThe problems we encountered in Henry's initial \ndream showed up in many others problems \nlike vacillation between masculine activity and \nfeminine passivity, or a tendency to hide be­\nhind intellectual asceticism. He feared the \nworld, yet was attracted to it. Fundamentally, \nhe feared the obligations of marriage, which \ndemanded that he form a responsible relation­\nship with a woman. Such an ambivalence is \nnot unusual for someone on the threshold of \nmanhood. Though in terms of age Henry had \nleft that phase behind him, his inner maturity \ndid not match his years. This problem is often \nmet in the introvert, with his fear of reality and \nouter life. \nThe fourth dream that Henry recounted \nprovided a striking illustration of his psycho­\nlogical state: \nIt seems to me that I have had this dream \nendless times. Military service, long-distance race. \nAlone I go on my way. I never reach the goal. \nWill I be the last? The course is well known to \nme, all of it deja vu. The start is in a little wood, \nand the ground is covered with dry leaves. The \nterrain slopes gently to an idyllic little brook \nthat invites one to tarry. Later, there is a dusty \ncountry road. It leads toward Hombrechtikon, a \nsmall village near the upper lake of Zurich. A \nbrook bordered by willows similar to a painting \nof Bocklin's in which a dreamy female figure \nfollows the course of the water. Night falls. In a \nvillage I ask for directions to the road. I am told \nthe road leads on for seven hours over a pass. I \ngather myself together and go on. \nHowever, this time the end of the dream differs. \nAfter the willow-bordered brook I get into a \nwood. There I discover a doe that runs away. \nI am proud of this observation. The doe has \nappeared on the left side and now I turn to the \nright. Here I see three strange creatures, hall \npig, half dog, with the legs of a kangaroo. The \nfaces are quite undifferentiated, with large droop­\ning dog ears. Maybe they are costumed people. As a \nboy, I once masqueraded in the circus costume of \na donkey. \n28l\n\f\nThe beginning of the dream is conspicuously \nlike Henry's initial dream. A dreamlike female \nfigure again appears, and the setting of the \ndream is associated with another painting \nby Bocklin. This painting, called Autumn \n'Thoughts, and the dry leaves mentioned earlier \nin the dream underline the autumnal mood. \nA romantic atmosphere also reappears in this \ndream. Apparently this inner landscape, repre­\nsenting Henry's melancholy, is very familiar to \nhim. Again he is in a collective of people, but \nthis time with military comrades on a long­\ndistance race. \nThis whole situation (as the military service \nalso suggests) might be regarded as a repre­\nsentation of an average man's fate. Henry him­\nself said: \"It's a symbol of life.\" But the \ndreamer does not want to adjust to it. He goes \non alone - which was probably always the case \nwith Henry. That is why he has the impres­\nsion that everything is dejci vu. His thought \n(\"I never reach the goal\") indicates strong feel­\nings of inferiority and a belief that he cannot \nwin the \"long-distance race.\" \nHis way leads to Hornbrechtikon, a name \nthat reminds him of his secret plans to break \naway from home (Horn = home, brechen = to \nbreak). But because this breaking away does \nnot occur, he again (as in the initial dream) \nloses his sense of orientation and must ask for \ndirections. \nDreams compensate more or less explicitly \nfor the dreamer's conscious attitude of mind. \nThe romantic, maidenly figure of Henry's con­\nscious ideal is balanced by the appearance of \nthe strange, female-like animals. Henry's world \nof instincts is symbolized by something femi­\nnine. The wood is a symbol of an unconscious \narea, a dark place where animals live. At first \na doe — a symbol of shy, fugitive, innocent \nwomanliness — emerges, but only for a moment. \nThen Henry sees three mixed-up animals of a \nstrange and repulsive appearance. They seem \nto represent undifferentiated instinctuality — a \nsort of confused mass of his instincts, contain­\ning the raw material for a later development. \nTheir most striking characteristic is that they \nare all virtually faceless, and thus without the \nslightest glimmerings of consciousness. \nIn the minds of many people, the pig is \nclosely associated to dirty sexuality. (Circe, \nfor example, changed the men who desired her \ninto swine.) The dog may stand for loyalty, \nbut also for promiscuity, because it shows no \ndiscrimination in its choice of partners. The \nkangaroo, however, is often a symbol for moth-\nerliness and tender carrying capacity. \nAll these animals present only rudimentary \ntraits, and even these are senselessly contami­\nnated. In alchemy, the \"prime material\" was \noften represented by such monstrous and fabu­\nlous creatures mixed forms of animals. In \npsychological terms, they would probably sym­\nbolize the original total unconsciousness, out \nof which the individual ego can rise and begin \nto develop toward maturity. \nLeft, Henry's drawing of the strange \nanimals of his dream. They are mute \nand blind, unable to communicate, \nand so represent his unconscious \nstate The animal on the ground \n(which he colored green, the color of \nvegetation and nature, and in folk \nlore a symbol of hope) hints at \npossibilities of growth and a chance \nof differentiation.\n\f\nHenry's fear of the monsters becomes evident \nby his attempt to make them seem harmless. \nHe wants to convince himself that they are \nonly dressed-up people, like himself in a boy­\nhood masquerade. His anxiety is natural. A \nman discovering such inhuman monsters in his \ninner self, as symbols of certain traits of his \nunconscious, has every reason to be afraid. \nAnother dream also shows Henry's fear of \nthe depths of the unconscious: \nI am a cabin boy in a sailing boat. Paradoxi­\ncally, the sails are spread, though there is a \ncomplete calm. My task consists of holding a \nrope that serves to fasten a mast. Strangely enough, \nthe railing is a wall covered with stone slabs. \nThis whole structure lies exactly on the border \nbetwren the water and the sailing boat that \nfloats there alone. I hold fast to the rope (not to \nthe mast) and I am forbidden to look into the \nwater. \nIn this dream Henry is in a psychological \nborderline situation. The railing is a wall that \nprotects him but at the same time obstructs his \nview. He is forbidden to look into the water \n(where he might discover unknown powers). \nAll these images reveal his doubt and fear. \nThe man who fears the communications of \nhis inner depths (like Henry) is as much afraid \nof the feminine element in himself as he is of \nreal women. At one moment he is fascinated \nby her, at another he tries to escape; fascinated \nand terrified, he flees so as not to become her \n\"prey.\" He does not dare to approach a be­\nloved (and therefore idealized) partner with \nhis animal-like sexuality. \nAs a typical result of his mother-tie, Henry \nhad difficulty in giving both feeling and sensu­\nality to the same woman. Again and again his \ndreams brought proof of his desire to free him-\nsell from this dilemma In one dream he \nwas a \"monk on a secret mission.\" In another, \nhis instincts tempted him into a brothel: \nTogether with a military comrade who has had \nmany erotic adventures I find myself waiting in \nfront of a house on a dark street in an unknown \ncity. Entrance is permitted only to women. There­\nfore, in the hall, my friend puts on a little carni­\nval mask of a woman's face and goes up the stairs. \nPossibly I did the same as he, but I do not remember \nclearlv. \nWhat this dream proposes would satisfy \nHenry's curiosity — but only at the price of a \nfraud. As a man he lacks the courage to enter \nthe house, which is obviously a brothel. But if \nhe divests himself of his masculinity, he might \ngain an insight into this forbidden world for­\nbidden by his conscious mind. The dream, \nhowever, does not tell us whether he decides \nto enter. Henry had not yet overcome his inhi­\nbitions an understandable failure if we con­\nsider the implications of going into the brothel. \nThe above dream seemed to me to reveal a \nhomoerotic strain in Henry: He appeared to \nfeel that a feminine \"mask\" would make him \nThe pig like animal of the dream \nconnotes bestiality and lustfulness— \nas in the myth of Circe, who turned \nmen into swine Above left, from \na Greek vase, a pig-man, Odysseus, \nand Circe, Right, in one of the \ncartoons by George Grosz attacking \npre war German society, a man (with \na prostitute) is given a pig's head \nto show his vulgarity"

    "raw_text": "attractive to men. This hypothesis was sup­\nported by the following dream: \nThe saint and the prostitute \nI find myself back in rny fifth or sixth year. My \nplaymate of those days tells me how he partici­\npated in an obscene act with the director of a \nfactory. My friend laid his right hand on the \nman's penis to keep it warm and at the same \ntime to warm his own hand. The director was an \nintimate friend of my father's whom I venerated \nfor his broad and varied interests. But he was \nlaughed at by us as an \"eternal youth.\" \nFor children of that age homoerotic play is \nnot unusual. That Henry still came to it in his \ndream suggests that it was loaded with guilt \nfeelings, and therefore strongly repressed. Such \nfeelings were linked to his deep fear about form­\ning a lasting tie with a woman. Another dream \nand its associations illustrated this conflict: \nI take part in the wedding of an unknown couple. \nAt one in the morning the little wedding party \nreturns from the festivities—the bridal couple, the \nbest man, and the maid of honor. They enter a \nlarge courtyard where I await them. It seems \nthat the newlyweds have already had a quarrel, as \nwell as the other couple. They finally find the \nsolution by having the two men and the two women \nretire separately. \nHenry explained: \"You see here the war of \nthe sexes as Giraudoux describes it.\" And then \nhe added: \"The palace in Bavaria, where I \nremember seeing this dream-courtyard, has \nuntil lately been disfigured by emergency \nhousing for poor people. When I visited there, \nI asked myself if it would not be preferable to \neke out a poor existence in the ruins of classic \nbeauty than to lead an active life surrounded \nby the ugliness of a great city. I also asked \nmyself when I was a witness at the wedding \nof a comrade whether his marriage would last, \nfor his bride made an unfavorable impression \non me.\" \nThe longing to withdraw into passivity and \nintroversion, the fear of an unsuccessful mar­\nriage, the dream's separation of the sexes — all \nthese are unmistakable symptoms of the secret \ndoubts hidden beneath Henry's consciousness. \nHenry's psychic condition was most impres­\nsively depicted in the following dream, which \nexposed his fear of primitive sensuality and \nhis desire to escape into a kind of asceticism. \nIn it one can see the direction his development \nwas taking. For this reason the dream will be \ninterpreted at greater length. \nI find myself on a narrow mountain road. On \nthe left (going down) there is a deep abyss, on \nthe right a wall of rock. Along the road there are \nseveral caves, shelters, cut out of the rock, as \nprotection from the weather for lonely wan­\nderers. In one of these caves, half hidden, a \nprostitute has taken refuge. Strangely, I see her \nfrom behind, from the rock side. She has a form­\nless, spongy body. I look at her with curiosity \nand touch her buttocks. Perhaps, it suddenly \nseems to me, she is not a woman but a kind of \nmale prostitute. \nThis same creature comes then to the fore as a \nsaint with a short crimson coat thrown around \nhis shoulders. He strides down the road and goes \ninto another, much larger cave fitted with rough-\nhewn chairs and benches. With a haughty look \nhe drives out all those already present, also me. \nThen he and his followers move in and establish \nthemselves. \nThe personal association that Henry contri­\nbuted to the prostitute was the \"Venus of Wil-\nlendorf,\" a little carved figure (from the paleo-\n284\n\f\nlitliic age) of a fleshy woman, probably a \nnature or fertility goddess. Then he added : \n\"I first heard that touching the buttocks is a \nfertility rite when I was on a tour through the \nWallis [a canton in French Switzerland ], where \nI visited ancient Celtic graves and excavations. \nThere I was told that there was once a smooth \nsloping surface of tiles smeared with all kinds \nof substances. Infertile women had to slide \ndown on their bare buttocks in order to cure \ntheir sterility.\" \nTo the coat of the \"saint,\" Henry associated \nthis: \"My fiancee owns a jacket of similar \nshape, but it's white. On the evening before \nthe dream we were out dancing, and she was \nwearing this white jacket. Another girl, who \nis her friend, was with us. She had a crimson \njacket that I liked better.\" \nIf dreams are not wish-fulfillments (as Freud \ntaught) but rather, as Jung assumed, \"self-re­\npresentations of the unconscious,\" then we must \nadmit that Henry's psychic condition could \nhardly be better represented than in the de­\nscription given in the \"saint\" dream. \nHenry is a \"lonely wanderer\" on the narrow \npath. But (perhaps thanks to analysis)\" he is \nalready on his way down from inhospitable \nheights. To the left, on the side of the uncon­\nscious, his road is bordered by the terrifying \ndepths of an abyss. On the right side, the side \nof consciousness, the way is blocked by the \nrigid rock wall of his conscious views. How­\never, in the caves (which might represent, so \nto speak, unconscious areas in Henry's field of \nconsciousness) there are places where refuge can \nbe found when bad weather comes in other \nwords, when outside tensions become too \nthreatening. \nThe caves are the result of purposeful human \nwork: cut into the rock. In a way they re­\nsemble the gaps that occur in our conscious­\nness when our power of concentration has \nreached its limits and is broken, so that the \nstuff of fantasy can penetrate without restraint. \nAt such times something unexpected can reveal \nitself and allow a deep insight into the back­\nground of the psyche a glimpse into the un­\nconscious regions where our imagination has \nfree play. Moreover, rock caves may be symbols \nof the womb of Mother Earth, appearing as \nmysterious caverns in which transformation \nand rebirth can come about. \nThus the dream seems to represent Henry's \nintroverted withdrawal —when the world be­\ncomes too difficult for him - into a \"cave\" with­\nin his consciousness where he can succumb to \nsubjective fantasies. This interpretation would \nalso explain why he seeks the female figure -\nLeft, Henry's drawing of the boat \nof his dream, with a stone wall for \na railing—another image of his \nintroversion and fear of life \nRight, the prehistoric sculpture \nknown as the \"Venus of Willendorf\" \n- one of Henry's associations to \nthe image of the prostitute in his \ndream. In the same dream, the saint \nis seen in a sacred cave. Many \nactual caves are holy places —like \nthe Cave of Bernadette (far right) \nat Lourdes, where a vision of the \nVirgin Mary appeared to a girl. \n285\n\f\na replica of some of the inner feminine traits of \nhis psyche. She is a formless, spongy, half-\nhidden prostitute representing the repressed \nimage in his unconscious of a woman whom \nHenry would never have approached in con­\nscious life. She would always have been strictly \ntaboo to him in spite of the fact that (as the \nopposite of a too-much-venerated mother) the \nprostitute would have a secret fascination for \nhim —as for every son with a mother-complex. \nThe idea of restricting a relationship with a \nwoman to a purely animal-like sensuality, ex­\ncluding all feelings, is often enticing to such a \nyoung man. In such a union he can keep his \nfeelings split off, and thus can remain \"true\" \nto his mother in an ultimate sense. Thus, in \nspite of everything, the taboo set by the mother \nagainst every other woman remains inflexibly \neffective in the psyche of the son. \nHenry, who seems to have withdrawn totally \nto the background of his fantasy-cave, sees the \nprostitute only \"from behind.\" He dares not \nlook her in the face. But \"from the back\" also \nmeans from her least human side her buttocks \n(i.e. the part of her body that will stimulate \nthe sensual activity of the male). \nBy touching the buttocks of the prostitute, \nHenry unconsciously carries out a kind of fer­\ntility rite, similar to the rites that are practiced \nin many primitive tribes. The laying on of \nhands and healing often go together; in the \nsame way, touching with the hand can be \neither a defense or a curse. \nImmediately the idea arises that the figure is \nnot a woman after all but a male prostitute. \nThe figure thus becomes hermaphroditic, like \nmany mythological figures (and like the \"priest\" \nfigure of the first dream). Insecurity concerning \nhis own sex can often be observed in a pubes­\ncent individual; and for this reason homosexu­\nality in adolescence is not considered unusual. \nNor is such uncertainty exceptional for a young \nman with Henry's psychological structure; he \nhad already implied this in some of his earlier \ndreams. \nBut repression (as well as sexual uncertainty) \nmay have caused the confusion about the sex \nof the prostitute. The female figure that has \nA coat can often symbolize the outer \nmask or  persona that one presents to \nthe world. The mantle of the prophet \nElijah bore a similar meaning: When \nhe ascended to heaven (left, in a \nSwedish peasant painting), he left \nthe mantle behind for his successor \nElisha Thus the mantle represented \nthe prophet's power and role, to be \nassumed by his successor (In the \npainting the mantle is red, like the \nsaint'scoat in Henry's dream.)\n\f\nboth attracted and repelled the dreamer is \ntransformed first of all into a man and then \ninto a saint. The second transformation elimi­\nnates everything sexual from the image, and \nimplies that the only means of escape from the \nreality of sex lies in the adoption of an ascetic \nand holy life, denying the flesh. Such dramatic \nreversals are common in dreams: Something \nturns into its opposite (as the prostitute becomes \na saint) as if to demonstrate that by transmuta­\ntion even extreme opposites can change into \neach other. \nHenry also saw something significant in the \nsaint's coat. A coat is often a symbol of the \nprotective cover or mask (which Jung called the \npersona) that an individual presents to the \nworld. It has two purposes: first, to make a \nspecific impression on other people: second, to \nconceal the individual's inner self from their \nprying eyes. The persona that Henry's dream \ngives the saint tells us something about his atti­\ntude to his fiancee and her friend. The saint's \ncoat has the color of the friend's jacket, which \nHenry had admired, but it also had the shape \nof his fiancee's coat. This may imply that \nHenry's unconscious wanted to confer the \nquality of saintliness on both women, in order \nto protect himself against their womanly attrac­\ntiveness. Also, the coat is red, which (as has \nbeen noted before) is traditionally the symbolic \ncolor of feeling and passion. It thus gives the \nsaint figure a kind of eroticized spirituality — a \nquality that is frequently found in men who \nrepress their own sexuality and try to rely solely \non their \"spirit\" or reason. \nSuch an escape from the world of the flesh, \nhowever, is unnatural in a young person. In \nthe first half of life, we should learn to accept \nour sexuality : It is essential to the preservation \nand continuation of our species. The dream \nseems to be reminding Henry of just this point. \nWhen the saint leaves the cave and walks \ndown the road (descending from the heights \ntoward the valley), he enters a second cave \nwith rough-hewn benches and chairs, which \nreminds one of the early Christians' places of \nworship and refuge from persecution. This cave \nseems to be a healing, holy place a place of \nmeditation and of the mystery of transforma­\ntion from the earthly to the heavenly, from the \ncarnal to the spiritual. \nHenry is not permitted to follow the saint, \nbut is turned out of the cave with all those \npresent (that is, with his unconscious entities). \nSeemingly. Henry and all the others who are \nnot followers of the saint are being told that \nthey must live in the outside world. The dream \nseems to say that Henry must first succeed in \nouter life before he will be able to immerse him­\nself in a religious or spiritual sphere. The figure \nof the saint also seems to symbolize (in a rela­\ntively undifferentiated, anticipatory fashion) \nthe Self; but Henry is not yet mature enough to \nstay in the immediate vicinity of this figure. \nHenry's touching the prostitute can \nbe related to the belief in the \nmagical effect of a touch: Left, \nthe 17th century Irishman Valentine \nGreatrakes, famous for healing by \nlaying on of hands \nRight, another example of the \npersona The clothing worn by \nrebellious British \"beatnik\" youths \nin the 1960s indicated the values \nand way of life that they wanted to \ndisplay to the outer world.\n\f\nHow the analysis developed \nIn spite of an initial skepticism and resistance, \nHenry began to take a lively interest in the \ninner happenings of his psyche. He was obvi­\nously impressed by his dreams. They seemed to \ncompensate for his unconscious life in a mean­\ningful way and to give him valuable insights \ninto his ambivalence, his vacillation, and his \npreference for passivity. \nAfter a time more positive dreams appeared \nthat showed that Henry was already \"well on \nhis way.\" Two months after his analysis had \nbegun he reported this dream: \nIn the harbor of a little place not far from my \nhome, on the shore of a lake in the neighborhood, \nlocomotives and freight cars are being raised \nfrom the bottom of the lake where they had been \nsunk in the last war. First a large cylinder like \na locomotive boiler is brought up. Then an enor­\nmous, rusty freight car. The whole picture pre-\nsents a horrible yet romantic sight. The recovered \npieces have to be transported away under the \nrails and cables of the nearby railway station. \nThen the bottom of the lake changes into a green \nmeadow. \nHere we see what a remarkable inner ad­\nvance Henry has made. Locomotives (probably \nsymbols of energy and dynamism) have been \n\"sunk\" —i.e. repressed into the unconscious — \nbut are now being brought into the light of \nday. With them are freight cars, in which all \nkinds of valuable cargo (psychic qualities) can \nbe transported. Now that these \"objects\" have \nagain become available for Henry's conscious \nlife, he can begin to realize how much active \npower could be at his disposal. The transforma­\ntion of the dark lake bottom into a meadow \nunderlines his potential for positive action. \nSometimes, on Henry's \"lonely journey\" to­\nward maturity, he also received help from his\n\f\nfeminine side. In his 24th dream he meets a \n\"humpbacked girl\": \nI am on the way to a school together with an \nunknown young lady of small and daintv appear­\nance but disfigured by a hump. Many other \npeople also go into the schoolhouse. While the \nothers disperse to different rooms for singing \nlessons, the girl and I sit at a little square table. \nShe gives me a private singing lesson. I feel an \nimpulse of pity for her and therefore kiss her on \nthe mouth. I am conscious, however, that by this \nact I am unfaithful to my fiancee- even though it \nmay be excusable. \nSinging is one of the immediate expressions \nof feelings. But (as we have seen) Henry is afraid \nof his feelings; he knows them only in an \nidealized adolescent form. Nevertheless, in this \ndream he is taught singing (the expression of \nfeelings) at a square table. The table, with its \nfour equal sides, is a representation of the \n\"fourfoldness\" motif, usually a symbol of com­\npleteness. Thus the relation between singing \nAs in the painting, left (by the \n19th century British artist William \nTurner), entitled  Rain, Steam, and \nSpeed,  the locomotive is clearly an \nimage of driving, dynamic energy \nIn Henry'sdream (which hedrew, \nbelow), locomotives are raised out \nof a lake — an expression of the \nrelease of a potential for valuable \naction that had previously been \nrepressed into his unconscious \nand the square table seems to indicate that \nHenry must integrate his \"feeling\" side before \nhe can achieve psychic wholeness. In fact, the \nsinging lesson does move his feelings, and he \nkisses the girl on her mouth. Thereby he has, in \na sense, \"espoused\" her (otherwise he would \nnot feel \"unfaithful\"); he has learned to relate \nto \"the woman within.\" \nAnother dream demonstrates the part that \nthis little humpbacked girl had to play in \nHenry's inner development: \nI am in an unknown boys\" school. During the \ninstruction period I secretly force my way into \nthe house. I don't know for what purpose. I hide in \nthe room behind a little square closet. The door to \nthe corridor is half open. I fear being detected. An \nadult goes by without seeing me. But a little hump­\nbacked girl comes in and sees me at once. She pulls \nme out of my hiding place. \nNot only does the same girl appear in both \ndreams, but both appearances take place in a \nschoolhouse. In each instance Henry must learn \nsomething to assist his development. Seemingly, \nhe would like to satisfy his desire for know­\nledge while remaining unnoticed and passive. \nThe figure of a deformed little girl appears \nin numerous fairy tales. In such tales the ugli­\nness of the hump usually conceals great beauty, \nwhich is revealed when the \"right man\" comes \nto free the girl from a magic spell —often by a \nkiss. The girl in Henry's dream may be a \nsymbol of Henry's soul, which also has to be \nreleased from the \"spell\" that has made it ugly. \nWhen the humpbacked girl tries to awaken \nHenry's feelings by song, or pulls him out of \nhis dark hiding place (forcing him to confront \nthe light of dayi, she shows herself as a helpful \nguide. Henry can and must in a sense belong \nsimultaneously to both his fiancee and the little \nhumpbacked girl (to the first as a representative \nof the real, outer woman, and to the second \nas the embodiment of the inner psychic anima). \n289\n\f\nThe oracle dream \nPeople who rely totally on their rational think­\ning and dismiss or repress every manifestation \nof their psychic life often have an almost inex­\nplicable inclination to superstition. They listen \nto oracles and prophecies and can be easily \nhoodwinked or influenced by magicians and \nconjurers. And because dreams compensate \none's outer life, the emphasis such people put \non their intellect is offset by dreams in which \nthey meet the irrational and cannot escape it. \nHenry experienced this phenomenon in the \ncourse of his analysis, in an impressive way. \nFour extraordinary dreams, based on such irra­\ntional themes, represented decisive milestones \nin his spiritual development. The first of these \ncame about 10 weeks after the analysis began. \nAs Henry reported the dream: \nAlone on an adventurous journey through South \nAmerica, I feel, at last, the desire to return home. In \na foreign city situated on a mountain I try to reach \nthe railway station, which I instinctively suspect \nto be in the center of the town at its highest level. I \nfear I may be too late. \nFortunately, however, a vaulted passage breaks \nthrough the row of houses on my right, built \nclosely together as in the architecture of the \nMiddle Ages, forming an impenetrable wall be­\nhind which the station is probably to be found. \nThe whole scene offers a very picturesque aspect. \nI see the sunny, painted facades of the houses, the \ndark archway in whose shadowy obscurity four \nragged figures have settled down on the pave­\nment. With a sigh of relief, I hurry toward the \npassage—when suddenly a stranger, a trapper-\ntype, appears ahead of me evidently filled with \nthe same desire to catch the train. \nAt our approach the four gatekeepers, who \nturn out to be Chinese, jump up to prevent our \npassage. In the ensuing fight my left leg is injured \nby the long nails on the left foot of one of the \nChinese. An oracle has to decide now whether the \nway could be opened to us or whether our lives \nmust be forfeited. \nI am the first to be dealt with. While my com­\npanion is bound and led inside, the Chinese con­\nsult the oracle by using little ivory sticks. The \njudgment goes against me, but I am given an­\nother chance. I am fettered and led aside, just \nas my companion was, and he now takes my \nplace. In his presence, the oracle has to decide \nmy fate for the second time. On this occasion it is \nin my favor. I am saved. \nOne immediately notices the singularity and \nthe exceptional meaning of the dream, its \nwealth of symbols, and its compactness. How­\never, it seemed as if Henry's conscious mind \nwanted to ignore the dream. Because of his skep­\nticism toward the products of his unconscious \nit was important not to expose the dream to \nthe danger of rationalization, but rather to let \nit act on him without interference. So I re­\nfrained at first from my interpretation. Instead \nI offered only one suggestion: I advised him \nto read and then to consult (as did .the Chinese \nfigures in his dream) the famous Chinese oracle \nbook, the / Ching. \nThe / Ching, the so-called \"Book of \nChanges,\" is a very ancient book of wisdom; \nits roots go back to mythical times, and it comes \nto us in its present form from 3000 B.C. Accord­\ning to Richard Wilhelm (who translated it into \nGerman and provided an admirable commen­\ntary), both of the main branches of Chinese \nphilosophy—Taoism and Confucianism—have \ntheir common origin in the / Ching. The book \nis based on the hypothesis of the oneness of \nman and the surrounding cosmos, and of the \ncomplementary pairs of opposites Yang and \nYin (i.e. the male and female principles). It \nconsists of 64 \"signs\" each represented by a \ndrawing made up of six lines. In these signs are \ncontained all the possible combinations of Yang \nand Yin. The straight lines are looked upon as \nmale, the broken lines as female. \nEach sign describes changes in the human \nor cosmic situation, and each prescribes, in a \n290\n\f\npictorial language, the course of action to be \nfollowed at such times. The Chinese consulted \nthis oracle by means that indicated which of \nthe signs was relevant at a given moment. They \ndid so by using 50 small sticks in a rather com­\nplicated way that yielded a given number. \n(Incidentally, Henry said that he had once read \n— probably in Jung's commentary on \"The \nSecret of the Golden Flower\"—of a strange \ngame sometimes used by the Chinese to find \nout about the future.) \nToday the more usual method of consulting \nthe / Ching is to use three coins. Each throw \nof the three coins yields one line. \"Heads,\" \nwhich stands for a male line, count as three; \n\"tails,\" a broken female line, count as two. \nThe coins are thrown six times, and the num­\nbers that are produced indicate the sign or \nhexagram (i.e. the set of six lines) to be \nconsulted. \nBut what significance has such \"fortune tell­\ning\" for our own time? Even those who accept \nthe idea that the / Ching is a storehouse of \nwisdom will find it hard to believe that con­\nsultation of the oracle is anything more than \nan experiment in the occult. It is indeed diffi­\ncult to grasp that more is involved, for the \nordinary person today consciously dismisses all \ndivining techniques as archaic nonsense. Yet \nthey are not nonsense. As Dr. Jung has shown, \nthey are based on what he calls the \"principle \nof synchronicity\" for, more simply, meaningful \ncoincidence). He has described this difficult new \nidea in his essay \"Synchronicity: An Acausal \nConnecting Principle.\" It is based on the \nassumption of an inner unconscious knowledge \nthat links a physical event with a psychic con­\ndition, so that a certain event that appears \n\"accidental\" or \"coincidental\" can in fact be \npsychically meaningful; and its meaning is \noften symbolically indicated through dreams \nthat coincide with the event. \nSeveral weeks after having studied the / \nChing, Henry followed my suggestion (with \nconsiderable skepticism) and threw the coins. \nWhat he found in the book had a tremendous \nimpact on him. Briefly, the oracle to which he \nreferred bore several startling references to his \ndream, and to his psychological condition gen­\nerally. By a remarkable \"synchronistic\" coinci­\ndence, the sign that was indicated by the coin-\npattern was called MENG- or \"Youthful Folly.\" \nLeft, two pages of the /  Ching \nshowing the hexagram MENG (which \nstands for \"youthful folly\"). The \ntop three lines of the hexagram \nsymbolize a mountain, and can also \nrepresent a gate; the bottom three \nlines symbolize water and the abyss. \nRight, Henry's drawing of the sword \nand helmet that appeared to him in \na fantasy, and that also related to \na section of the /  Ching —  Li, \"the \nclinging, fire.\"\n\f\nIn this chapter there are several parallels to the \ndream motifs in question. According to the text \nof the / Ching, the three upper lines of this \nhexagram symbolize a mountain, and have the \nmeaning of ''keeping still\"; they can also be \ninterpreted as a gate. The three lower lines sym­\nbolize water, the abyss, and the moon. All these \nsymbols have occurred in Henry's previous \ndreams. Among many other statements that \nseemed to apply to Henry was the following \nwarning: \"For youthful folly, it is the most \nhopeless thing to entangle itself in empty imag­\ninings. The more obstinately it clings to such \nunreal fantasies the more certainly will humilia­\ntion overtake it.\" \nIn this and other complex ways, the oracle \nseemed to be directly relevant to Henry's pro­\nblem. This shook him. At first he tried to sup­\npress its effect by willpower, but he could not \nescape it or his dreams. The message of the \n/ Clung seemed to touch him deeply in spite of \nthe puzzling language in which it was expressed. \nHe became overpowered by the very irration­\nality whose existence he had so long denied. \nSometimes silent, sometimes irritated, reading \nthe words that seemed to coincide so strongly \nwith the symbols in his dreams, he said, \"I must \nthink all this over thoroughly,\" and he left \nbefore our session was up. He canceled his next \nsession by telephone, because of influenza, and \ndid not reappear. I waited '\"keeping still\") \nbecause I supposed that he might not yet have \ndigested the oracle. \nA month went by. Finally Henry reappeared, \nexcited and disconcerted, and told me what had \nhappened in the meantime. Initially his intel­\nlect (which he had until then relied upon so \nmuch) had suffered a great shock — and one \nthat he had at first tried to suppress. However, \nhe soon had to admit that the communications \nof the oracle were pursuing him. He had in­\ntended to consult the book again, because in \nhis dream the oracle had been consulted twice. \nBut the text of the chapter \"Youthful Folly\" \nexpressly forbids the putting of a second ques­\ntion. For two nights Henry had tossed sleep-\nlessly in bed; but on the third a luminous \ndream image of great power had suddenly \nappeared before his eyes: a helmet with a \nsword floating in empty space. \nHenry immediately took up the / Ching \nagain and opened it at random to a commen­\ntary on Chapter 30, where (to his great sur­\nprise) he read the following passage: \"The \nclinging is fire, it means coats of mail, helmets, \nit means lances and weapons.\" Now he felt \nthat he understood why a second intentional \nconsulting of the oracle was forbidden. For in \nhis dream the ego was excluded from the \nsecond question; it was the trapper who had \nto consult the oracle the second time. In the \nsame way, it was Henry's semi-unconscious \naction that had unintentionally asked the \nsecond question of the / Ching by opening the \nbook at random and coming upon a symbol \nthat coincided with his nocturnal vision. \nHenry was clearly so deeply stirred that it \nseemed time to try to interpret the dream that \nhad sparked the transformation. In view of the \nevents of the dream, it was obvious that the \ndream-elements should be interpreted as con­\ntents of Henry's inner personality and the six \ndream-figures as personification of his psychic \nqualities. Such dreams are relatively rare, but \nwhen they do occur their after-effects are all \nthe more powerful. That is why they could \nbe called \"dreams of transformation.\" \nWith dreams of such pictorial power, the \ndreamer seldom has more than a few personal \nassociations. All Henry could offer was that he \nhad recently tried for a job in Chile, and had \nbeen refused because they would not employ \nunmarried men. He also knew that some \nChinese let the nails of their left hand grow \nas a sign that instead of working they have \ngiven themselves over to meditation. \nHenry's failure (to get a job in South \nAmerica! was presented to him in the dream. \nIn it he is transported into a hot southern \nRight, a parallel to the gatekeepers \nof Henry's \"oracle dream\": one of \na pair of sculptures (1 Oth-1 3th \ncentury) that guard the entrance \nto China's Mai-chi-san caves. \n292\n\f\nworld — a world that, in contrast to Europe, he \nwould call primitive, uninhibited, and sensual. \nIt represents an excellent symbolic picture of \nthe realm of the unconscious. \nThis realm was the opposite of the cultivated \nintellect and Swiss puritanism that ruled Hen­\nry's conscious mind. It was, in fact, his natural \n\"shadow land,\" for which he had longed; but \nafter a while he did not seem to feel too com­\nfortable there. From the chthonic. dark, \nmaternal powers (symbolized by South Ameri­\nca) he is drawn back in the dream to the light, \npersonal mother and to his fiancee. He sud­\ndenly realizes how far he has gone away from \nthem ; he finds himself alone in a \"foreign city.\" \nThis increase in consciousness is symbolized \nin the dream as a \"higher level\"; the city was \nbuilt on a mountain. So Henry \"climbed up\" \nto a greater consciousness in the \"shadow \nland\"; from there he hoped \"to find his way \nhome.\" This problem of ascending a mountain \nhad already been put to him in his initial \ndream. And, as in the dream of the saint and \nthe prostitute, or in many mythological tales, a \nmountain often symbolizes a place of revela­\ntion, where transformation and change may \ntake place. \nThe \"city on the mountain\" is also a well-\nknown archetypal symbol that appears in the \nhistory of our culture in many variations. The \ncity, corresponding in its ground plan to a man-\ndala, represents that \"region of the soul\" in the \nmiddle of which the Self (the psyche's inner­\nmost center and totality) has its abode. \nSurprisingly, the seat of the Self is repre­\nsented in Henry's dream as a traffic center of \nthe human collective — a railway station. This \nmay be because the Self (if the dreamer is \nyoung and has a relatively low level of spiritual \ndevelopment) is usually symbolized by an object \nfrom the realm of his personal experience \noften a banal object, which compensates the \ndreamer's high aspirations. Only in the mature \nperson acquainted with the images of his soul \nis the Self realized in a symbol that corresponds \nto its unique value. \nEven though Henry does not actually know \nwhere the station is, he nevertheless supposes it \nto be in the center of the city, on its highest \npoint. Here, as in earlier dreams, he receives \nhelp from his unconscious. Henry's conscious \nmind was identified with his profession as an \nengineer, so he would also like his inner world \nto relate to rational products of civilization, like \na railway station. The dream, however, rejects \nthis attitude and indicates a completely dif­\nferent way. \nThe way leads \"under\" and through a dark \narch. An arched gateway is also a symbol for a \nthreshold, a place where dangers lurk, a place \nthat at the same time separates and unites. \nInstead of the railway station that Henry was \nlooking for, which was to connect uncivilized \nSouth America with Europe, Henry finds him­\nself before a dark arched gateway where four \nragged Chinese, stretched on the ground, block \nthe passage. The dream makes no distinction \nbetween them, so they may be seen as four still \nundifferentiated aspects of a male totality. (The \nnumber (bur, a symbol of wholeness and com-\n293\n\f\npleteness, represents an archetype that Dr. Jung \nhas discussed at length in his writings.) \nThe Chinese thus represent unconscious male \npsychic parts of Henry that he cannot pass, be­\ncause the \"way to the Self\" (i.e. to the psychic \ncenter) is barred by them and must still be \nopened to him. Until this issue has been settled \nhe cannot continue his journey. \nStill unaware of the impending danger, \nHenry hurries to the gateway, expecting at last \nto reach the station. But on his way he meets \nhis \"shadow\" — his unlived, primitive side, \nwhich appears in the guise of an earthy, rough \ntrapper. The appearance of this figure probably \nmeans that Henry's introverted ego has been \njoined by his extraverted (compensatory) side, \nwhich represents his repressed emotional and \nirrational traits. This shadow figure pushes itself \npast the conscious ego into the foreground, and, \nbecause it personifies the activity and autonomy \nof unconscious qualities, it becomes the proper \ncarrier of fate, through whom everything \nhappens. \nThe dream moves toward its climax. During \nthe fight between Henry, the trapper, and the \nfour ragged Chinese, Henry's left leg is \nscratched by the long nails on the left foot of \none of the four. (Here, it seems, the European \ncharacter of Henry's conscious ego has collided \nwith a personification of the ancient wisdom of \nthe East, with the extreme opposite of his ego. \nThe Chinese come from an entirely different \npsychic continent, from an \"other side\" that is \nstill quite unknown to Henry and that seems \ndangerous to him.) \nThe Chinese can also be said to stand for the \n\"yellow earth\"; for the Chinese people are \nrelated to the earth as few people are. And it \nis just this earthy, chthonic quality that Henry \nhad to accept. The unconscious male totality \nof his psyche, which he met in his dream, had \na chthonic material aspect that his intellectual \nconscious side lacked. Thus the fact that he \nrecognized the four ragged figures as Chinese \nshows that Henry had gained an increase of \ninner awareness concerning the nature of his \nadversaries. \nHenry had heard that the Chinese sometimes \nlet the nails of their left hand grow long. But \nin the dream the long nails are on the left foot; \nthey are, so to speak, claws. This may indicate \nthat the Chinese have a point of view so dif­\nferent from Henry's that it injures him. As we \nBelow, a drawing by a patient under \nanalysis depicts a black monster \n(on the red or \"feeling\" side) and a \nMadonna-like woman (on the blue \nor spiritual side). This was Henry's \nposition: over-emphasis on purity, \nchastity, etc. and fear of the \nirrational unconscious. (But note \nthat the green, mandala-like flower \nacts as a link between the opposing \nsides.) Below left, another patient's \npainting depicting his insomnia— \ncaused by his repressing too \nstrongly his passionate, red, \ninstinctual drives (which may \noverwhelm his consciousness) \nby a black \"wall\" of anxiety \nand depression.\n\f\nknow, Henry's conscious attitude toward the \nchthonic and feminine, toward the material \ndepths of his nature, was most uncertain and \nambivalent. This attitude, symbolized by his \n\"left leg\" (the point of view or \"standpoint\" of \nhis feminine, unconscious side of which he is \nstill afraid), was harmed by the Chinese. \nThis \"injury,\" however, did not itself bring \nabout a change in Henry. Every transforma­\ntion demands as its precondition \"the ending of \na world\" — the collapse of an old philosophy of \nlife. As Dr. Henderson has pointed out earlier \nin this book, at ceremonies of initiation a youth \nmust suffer a symbolic death before he can be \nreborn as a man and be taken into the tribe \nas a full member. Thus the scientific, logical \nattitude of the engineer must collapse to make \nroom for a new attitude. \nIn the psyche of an engineer, everything \n\"irrational\" may be repressed, and therefore \noften reveals itself in the dramatic paradoxes of \nthe dream-world. Thus the irrational appeared \nin Henry's dream as an \"oracle game\" of for­\neign origin, with a fearful and inexplicable \npower to decide human destinies. Henry's \nratirnal ego had no alternative but to surrender \nunconditionally in a real sacrificium intellectus. \nYet the conscious mind of such an inexperi­\nenced, immature person as Henry is not suffi­\nciently prepared for such an act. He loses the \nturn of fortune, and his life is forfeit. He is \ncaught, unable to go on in his accustomed way \nor to return home — to escape his adult respon­\nsibilities. (It was this insight for which Henry \nhad to be prepared by this \"great dream.\") \nNext, Henry's conscious, civilized ego is \nbound and put aside while the primitive trap­\nper is allowed to take his place and to consult \nthe oracle. Henry's life depends on the result. \nBut when the ego is imprisoned in isolation, \nthose contents of the unconscious that are per­\nsonified in the shadow-figure may bring help \nand solution. This becomes possible when one \nrecognizes the existence of such contents and \nhas experienced their power. They can then \nbecome our consciously accepted constant com­\npanions. Because the trapper (his shadow) wins \nthe game in his place, Henry is saved. \nFacing the irrational \nHenry's subsequent behavior clearly showed \nthat the dream (and the fact that his dreams \nand the oracle book of the / Ching had brought \nhim to face deep and irrational powers within \nhimself) had a very deep effect on him. From \nthen on he listened eagerly to the communica­\ntions of his unconscious, and the analysis took \non a more and more agitated character. The \ntension that until then had threatened the \ndepths of his psyche with disruption came to \nthe surface. Nevertheless, he courageously held \nto the growing hope that a satisfactory conclu­\nsion would be reached. \nBarely two weeks after the oracle dream (but \nbefore it was discussed and interpreted), Henry \nhad another dream in which he was once again \nconfronted with the disturbing problem of the \nirrational: \nAlone in my room. A lot of disgusting black \nbeetles crawl out of a hole and spread out over my \ndrawing table. I try to drive them back into their \nhole by means of some sort of magic. I am success­\nful in this except for four or five beetles, which \nleave my table again and spread out into the \nwhole room. I give up the idea of following them \nfurther; they are no longer so disgusting to me. I \nset fire to the hiding place. A tall column of flame \nrises up. I fear my room might catch fire, but this \nfear is unfounded. \nBy this time, Henry had become relatively \nskilful in the interpretation of his dreams, so he \ntried to give this dream an explanation of his \nown. He said : \"The beetles are my dark quali­\nties. They were awakened by the analysis and \ncome up now to the surface. There is a danger \nthat they may overflow my professional work \n(symbolized by the drawing table). Yet I did \nnot dare to crush the beetles, which reminded \nme of a kind of black scarab, with my hand as \nI first intended, and therefore had to use \n'magic' In setting fire to their hiding place I, \n295"

    "raw_text": "so to speak, call for the collaboration of some­\nthing divine, as the upshooting column of flame \nmakes me think of the fire that I associate with \nthe Ark of the Covenant.\" \nTo go deeper into the symbolism of the \ndream, we must first of all note that these \nbeetles are black, which is the color of darkness, \ndepression, and death. In the dream, Henry is \n\"alone\" in his room a situation that can lead \nto introversion and corresponding states of \ngloom. In mythology, scarab beetles often \nappear golden; in Egypt they were sacred \nanimals symbolizing the sun. But if they arc \nblack, they symbolize the opposite side of the \nsun something devilish. Therefore. Henry's \ninstinct is quite correct in wanting to fight the \nbeetles with magic. \nThough lour or five of the beetles remain \nalive, the decrease in the number of beetles is \nenough to free Henry from his fear and disgust. \nHe then tries to destroy their breeding ground \nby fire. This is a positive action, because fire \ncan symbolically lead to transformation and re­\nbirth (as, for instance, it does in the ancient \nmyth of the phoenix). \nIn his waking life, Henry now seemed full of \nenterprising spirit, but apparently he had not \nyet learned to use it to the right effect. There­\nfore, I want to consider another, later dream \nthat throws an even clearer light on his pro­\nblem. This dream presents in symbolic language \nHenrys fear of a responsible relationship with \na woman and his tendency to withdraw from \nthe feeling side of life: \nAbove, an Egyptian relief (c 1 300 \nB.C.) shows a scarab beetle and the \ngod Amon within the circle of the \nsun. In Egypt the golden scarab was \nitself a symbol of the sun. Below, \na guite different kind of insect, \nmore like the \"devilish\" beetles \nof Henry's dream: an engraving by \nthe 19th-century artist James Ensor \nof humans with dark, repulsive \ninsect bodies. \nAn old man is breathing his last. He is sur­\nrounded by his relatives, and I am among them. \nMore and more people gather in the large room, \neach one characterizing himself through precise \nstatements. There are a good 40 persons present. \nThe old man groans and mutters about \"unlived \nlife.\" His daughter, who wants to make his con­\nfession easier, asks him in what sense \"unlived\" \nis to be understood; whether cultural or moral. \nI he old man will not answer. His daughter sends \nme to a small adjoining room where I am to find \nthe answer by telling a fortune with cards. The \n\"nine\" that I turn up will give the answer, accord­\ning to the color. \n296\n\f\nI expect to turn up a nine at the very begin­\nning, but at first I turn up various kings and \nqueens. I am disappointed. Now I turn up nothing \nbut scraps of paper that don't belong to the game \nat all. Finally, I discover that there are no more \ncards in the deck but only envelopes and other \npieces of paper. Together with my sister, who is \nalso present, I look everywhere for the cards. \nFinally I discover one under a textbook or a note­\nbook. It is nine, a nine of spades. It seems to me \nthat this can only mean one thing: that it was \nmoral chains that prevented the old man from \n\"living his life.\" \nThe essential message of this strange dream \nwas to warn Henry what awaited him if he \nfailed to \"live his life.\" Ihe \"old man\" prob­\nably represents the dying \"ruling principle\"-\nthe principle that rules Henry's consciousness, \nbut whose nature is unknown to him. The 40 \npeople present symbolize the totality of Henry's \npsychic traits (40 is a number of totality, an \nelevated form of the number four). That the \nold man is dying could be a sign that part of \nHenry's male personality is on the verge of a \nfinal transformation. \nThe daughter's query about the possible \ncause of death is the unavoidable and decisive \nquestion. There seems to be an implication that \nthe old man's \"morality\" has prevented him \nfrom living out his natural feelings and drives. \nYet the dying man himself is silent. Therefore \nhis daughter (the personification of the mediat­\ning feminine principle, the anima) has to be­\ncome active. \nShe sends Henry to discover the answer from \nthe fortune-telling cards — the answer that will \nbe given by the color of the first nine turned up. \nThe fortune telling has to take place in an un­\nused, remote room (revealing how far away \nsuch a happening is from Henry's conscious \nattitude). \nHe is disappointed when at first he uncovers \nonly kings and queens (perhaps collective \nimages of his youthful veneration for power \nand wealth]. This disappointment becomes in­\ntense when the picture-cards run out, for this \nshows that the symbols of the inner world have \nalso been exhausted. Only \"scraps of paper\" \nare left, without any images. Thus the source \nof pictures dries up in the dream. Henry then \nhas to accept the help of his feminine side (this \ntime represented by his sister) to find the last \ncard. Together with her, he finally finds a card \n— the nine of spades. It is this card that must \nserve to indicate by its color what the phrase \n\"unlived life\" meant in the dream. And it is \nsignificant that the card is hidden under a text­\nbook or notebook- which probably represents \nthe arid intellectual formulas of Henry's tech­\nnical interests. \nThe nine has been a \"magic number\" for \ncenturies. According to the traditional symbol­\nism of numbers, it represents the perfect form \nof the perfected Trinity in its threefold eleva­\ntion. And there are endless other meanings \nassociated with the number nine in various ages \nand cultures. The color of the nine of spades is \nthe color of death and of lifelessness. Also, the \n\"spade\" image strongly brings to mind the form \nof a leaf, and therefore its blackness emphasizes \nthat instead of being green, vital, and natural \nit is now dead. Furthermore, the word \"spade\" \nderives from the Italian spada, which means \n\"sword\" or \"spear.\" Such weapons often sym­\nbolize the penetrating, \"cutting\" function of \nthe intellect. \nThus the dream makes it clear that it was \nthe \"moral bonds\" (rather than \"cultural\") that \ndid not allow the old man to \"live his life.\" In \nHenry's case, these \"bonds\" probably were his \nfear of surrendering fully to life, of accepting \nresponsibilities to a woman and thereby becom­\ning \"unfaithful\" to his mother. The dream has \ndeclared that the \"unlived life\" is an illness of \nwhich one can die. \nHenry could no longer disregard the message \nof this dream. He realized that one needs some­\nthing more than reason as a helpful compass in \nthe entanglements of life; it is necessary to seek \nthe guidance of the unconscious powers that \nemerge as symbols out of the depths of the \npsyche. With this recognition, the goal of this \npart of his analysis was reached. He now knew \nthat he was finally expelled from the paradise \nof an uncommitted life and that he could never \nreturn to it. \n297"

    "raw_text": "Above, a phoenix reborn in flames \n(from a medieval Arabic manuscript) \n—a well-known example of the \nmotif of death and rebirth by fire. \nBelow, a woodcut by the 19th-\ncentury French artist Grandville \nreflects some of the symbolic value \nof playing cards The Spades suit, \nfor instance, in French  Piques,  is \nsymbolically linked with the \n\"penetrating\" intellect and, by its \nblack color, with death. \nThe final dream \nA further dream came to confirm irrevocably \nthe insights Henry had gained. After some un­\nimportant short dreams that concerned his \neveryday life, the last dream (the 50th in the \nseries) appeared with all the wealth of symbols \nthat characterizes the so-called \"great dreams.\" \nFour of us form a friendly group, and we have \nthe following experiences: Evening: We are sitting \nat a long, raw-lumber table and drinking out of \neach of three different vessels: from a liqueur \nglass, a clear, yellow, sweet liqueur; from a wine \nglass, dark red Campari; from a large, classically \nshaped vessel, tea. In addition to us there is also \na girl of reserved, delicate nature. She pours her \nliqueur into the tea. \nNight: We have returned from a big drinking \nbout. One of us is the President de la Republique \nFranchise. We are in his palace. Walking out onto \nthe balcony we perceive him beneath us in the \nsnowy street as he, in his drunken condition, \nurinates against a mound of snow. His bladder \ncontent seems to be inexhaustible. Now he even \nruns after an old spinster who carries in her arms \na child wrapped in a brown blanket. He sprays \nthe child with his urine. The spinster feels the \nmoisture but ascribes it to the child. She hurries \naway with long steps. \nMorning: Through the street, which glistens in \nthe winter sun, goes a Negro: a gorgeous figure, \ncompletely naked. He walks toward the east, \ntoward Berne (that is, the Swiss capital). We are \nin French Switzerland. We decide to go to pay \nhim a visit. \nNoon: After a long automobile trip through a \nlonely snowy region we come to a city, and into \na dark house where the Negro is said to have put up. \nWe are very much afraid that he might be frozen \nto death. However, his servant, who is just as \ndark, receives us. Negro and servant are mute. \nWe look into the rusksacks we have brought \nwith us, to see what each could give the Negro as a \ngift. It must be some sort of object characteristic of \ncivilization. I am the first to make up my mind and \nI take a package of matches from the floor and \noffer it to the Negro with deference. After all have \npresented their gifts, we join with the Negro in a \nhappy feast, a joyous revel.\n\f\nEven at first glance the dream with its four \nparts makes an unusual impression. It encom­\npasses a whole day and moves toward the \n\"right,\" in the direction of growing conscious­\nness. The movement starts with the evening, \ngoes over into the night, and ends at noon, \nwhen the sun is at its zenith. Thus the cycle of \nthe \"day\" appears as a totality pattern. \nIn this dream the four friends seem to sym­\nbolize the unfolding masculinity of Henry's \npsyche, and their progress through the four \n\"acts\" of the dream has a geometric pattern \nthat reminds one of the essential construction \nof the mandala. As they first came from the \neast, then from the west, moving on toward \nthe \"capital\" of Switzerland (i.e. the center), \nthey seem to describe a pattern that tries to \nunite the opposites in a center. And this point is \nunderlined by the movement in time — the de­\nscent into the night of the unconsciousness, fol­\nlowing the sun's circuit, which is followed by \nan ascent to the bright zenith of consciousness. \nThe dream begins in the evening, a time \nwhen the threshold of consciousness is lowered \nand the impulses and images of the unconscious \ncan pass across it. In such a condition (when \nthe feminine side of man is most easily evoked) \nit is natural to find that a female figure joins \nthe four friends. She is the anima figure that \nbelongs to them all (\"reserved and delicate,\" \nreminding Henry of his sister) and connects \nthem all to each other. On the table stand three \nvessels of different character, which by their \nconcave form accentuate the receptiveness that \nis symbolic of the feminine. The fact that these \nvessels are used by all present indicates a \nmutual and close relatedness among them. The \nvessels differ in form (liqueur glass, wine glass, \nand a classically formed container) and in the \ncolor of their contents. The opposites into \nwhich these fluids divide—sweet and bitter, red \nand yellow, intoxicating and sobering—are all \nintermingled, through being consumed by each \nof the five persons present, who sink into an \nunconscious communion. \nThe girl seems to be the secret agent, the \ncatalyst who precipitates events (for it is the \nrole of the anima to lead a man into his UP. \nconscious, and thus to force him to deeper \nrecollection and increased consciousness). It is \nalmost as though with the mixing of liqueur \nand tea the party would approach its climax. \nThe second part of the dream tells us more \nof the happenings of this \"night.\" The four \nfriends suddenly find themselves in Paris \n(which, for the Swiss, represents the town of \nsensuality, of uninhibited joy and love). Here \na certain differentiation of the four takes place, \nespecially between the ego in the dream (which \nis to a great extent identified with the leading \nthinking function) and the \"President de la Re-\npublique,\" who represents the undeveloped \nand unconscious feeling function. \nThe ego (Henry and two friends, who may \nbe considered as representing his semi-conscious \nfunctions) looks down from the height of a \nbalcony on the President, whose characteristics \nare exactly what one would expect to find in \nthe undifferentiated side of the psyche. He is \nunstable, and has abandoned himself to his \ninstincts. He urinates on the street in a drunken \nstate; he is unconscious of himself, like a person \noutside civilization, following only his natural \nanimal urges. Thus the President symbolizes a \ngreat contrast to the consciously accepted stan­\ndards of a good middle-class Swiss scientist. \nOnly in the darkest night of the unconscious \ncould this side of Henry reveal itself. \nHowever, the President-figure also has a very \npositive aspect. His urine (which could be the \nsymbol of a stream of psychic libido) seems in­\nexhaustible. It gives evidence of abundance, of \ncreative and vital strength. (Primitives, for in­\nstance, regard everything coming from the body \n— hair, excrement, urine, or saliva—as creative, \nas having magical powers.) This unpleasant \n299\n\f\nPrcsidcnt-imagc, therefore, could also be a sign \nof the power and plenty that often adheres to \nthe shadow side of the ego. Not only does he \nurinate without embarrassment, but he runs \nafter an old woman who is holding a child. \nThis \"old spinster\" is in a way the opposite \nor complement of the shy, fragile anima of the \nfirst part of the dream. She is still a virgin, even \nthough old and seemingly a mother; in fact, \nHenry associated her to the archetypal image \nof Mary with the child Jesus. But the fact that \nthe baby is wrapped in a brown (earth-colored) \nblanket makes it seem to be the chthonic, earth-\nbound counter-image of the Savior rather than \na heavenly child. The President, who sprinkles \nthe child with his urine, seems to perform a \ntravesty of baptism. If we take the child as a \nsymbol of a potentiality within Henry that is \nstill infantile, then it could receive strength \nthrough this ritual. But the dream says nothing \nmore; the woman hurries away with the child. \nThis scene marks the turning point of the \ndream. It is morning again. Everything that \nwas dark, black, primitive, and powerful in the \nlast episode has been gathered together and \nsymbolized by a magnificent Negro, who \nappears naked -i.e. real and true. \nJust as darkness and bright morning—or hot \nurine and cold snow—are opposites, so now the \nblack man and the white landscape form a \nsharp antithesis. The four friends now must \norient themselves within these new dimensions. \nA drinking vessel from ancient \nPeru, in the shape of a woman, \nreflects the feminine symbolism \nof such containers, which occurs \nin Henry'sfinal dream. \nTheir position has changed; the way that led \nthrough Paris has brought them unexpectedly \ninto French Switzerland (where Henry's fian­\ncee came from). A transformation has taken \nplace in Henry during the earlier phase, when \nhe was overpowered by unconscious contents of \nhis psyche. Now, for the last time, he can begin \nto find his way forward from a place that was \nhis fiancees home (showing that he accepts her \npsychological background). \nAt the beginning he went from eastern \nSwitzerland to Paris (from the east to the west, \nwhere the way leads into darkness, the uncon­\nsciousness). He has now made a turn of 180\", \ntoward the rising sun and the ever-increasing \nclarity of consciousness. This way points to the \nmiddle of Switzerland, to its capital. Berne, and \nsymbolizes Henry's striving toward a center \nthat would unite the opposites within him. \nThe Negro is for some people the archetypal \nimage of \"the dark primal creature\" and thus \na personification of certain contents of,the un­\nconscious. Perhaps this is one reason why the \nNegro is so often rejected and feared by people \nof the white race. In him the white man sees \nhis living counterpart, his hidden, dark side \nbrought before his eyes. (This is just what most \npeople try to avoid; they want to cut it off and \nrepress it.) White men project onto the Negro \nthe primitive drives, the archaic powers, the \nuncontrolled instincts that they do not want to \nadmit in themselves, of which they are uncon­\nscious, and that they therefore designate as the \ncorresponding qualities of other people. \nFor a young man of Henry's age the Negro \nmay stand on the one hand for the sum of all \ndark traits repressed into unconsciousness; on \nthe other hand, he may represent the sum of \nhis primitive, masculine strength and poten­\ntialities, his emotional and physical power. That \nHenry and his friends intend consciously to \nconfront the Negro signifies therefore a decisive \nstep forward on the way to manhood. \nIn the meantime it has become noon, when \nthe sun is at its highest, and consciousness has \nreached its greatest clarity. We might say that \nHenrv's ego has continued to become more and \nmore compact, that he has enhanced his capa-\n300\n\f\ncity consciously to make decisions. It is still \nwinter, which may indicate a lack of feeling \nand warmth in Henry; his psychic landscape is \nstill wintry and apparently intellectually very \ncold. The four friends are afraid that the naked \nNegro (being accustomed to a warm climate) \nmight be frozen. But their fear turns out to be \ngroundless, for after a long drive through de­\nserted snow-covered country they stop in a \nstrange city and enter a dark house. This drive \nand the desolate country is symbolic of the long \nand wearisome search for self-development. \nA further complication awaits the four \nfriends here. The Negro and his servant are \nmute. Therefore it is not possible to make \nverbal contact with them; the four friends must \nseek other means to get in touch with the \nNegro. They cannot use intellectual means \n(words) but rather a feeling gesture to approach \nhim. They offer him a present as one gives an \noffering to the gods, to win their interest and \ntheir affection. And it has to be an object of \nour civilization, belonging to the values of the \nintellectual white man. Again a sacrificium \nintellectus is demanded to win the favor of the \nNegro, who represents nature and instinct. \nHenry is the first to make up his mind what \nto do. This is natural, since he is the bearer of \nthe ego, whose proud consciousness (or hybris) \nhas to be humbled. He picks up a box of \nmatches from the floor and presents it \"with \ndeference\" to the Negro. At first glance it may \nseem absurd that a small object lying on the \nfloor and probably thrown away should be the \nproper gift, but this was the right choice. \nMatches are stored and controlled fire, a means \nby which a flame can be lit and put out at any­\ntime. Fire and flame symbolize warmth and \nlove, feeling and passion; they are qualities of \nthe heart, found wherever human beings exist. \nIn giving the Negro such a present, Henry \nsymbolically combines a highly developed civil­\nized product of his conscious ego with the \ncenter of his own primitivity and male strength, \nsymbolized by the Negro. In this way, Henry \ncan come into the full possession of his male \nsides, with which his ego must remain in con­\nstant touch from now on. \nThis was the result. The six male persons — \nthe four friends, the Negro, and his servant — \nare now together in a gay spirit at a communal \nmeal. It is clear that here Henry's masculine \ntotality has been rounded out. His ego seems \nto have found the security it needs to enable \nhim consciously and freely to submit to the \ngreater archetypal personality within himself, \nwhich foreshadows the emergence of the Self. \nWhat happened in the dream had its parallel \nalso in Henry's waking life. Now he was sure \nof himself. Deciding quickly, he became serious \nabout his engagement. Exactly nine months \nafter his analysis had begun, he married in a \nlittle church of western Switzerland; and he \nleft the following day with his young wife for \nCanada to take up an appointment that he had \nreceived during the decisive weeks of his last \ndreams. Since then he has been living an active, \ncreative life as the head of a little family and \nholds an executive position in a great industry. \nHenry's case reveals, so to speak, an acceler­\nated maturation to an independent and respon­\nsible manliness. It represents an initiation into \nthe reality of outer life, a strengthening of the \nego and of his masculinity, and with this a com­\npletion of the first half of the individuation \nprocess. The second half—which is the estab­\nlishment of a right relationship between the ego \nand the Self—still lies ahead of Henry, in the \nsecond half of his life. \nNot every case runs such a successful and \nstirring course, and not every case can be \nhandled in a similar way. On the contrary, \nevery case is different. Not only do the young \nand the old, or the man and the woman, call \nfor different treatment; so does every indi­\nvidual in all these categories. Even the same \nsymbols require different interpretation in each \ncase. I have selected this one because it repre­\nsents an especially impressive example of the \nautonomy of the unconscious processes and \nshows by its abundance of images the untiring \nsymbol-creating power of the psychic back­\nground. It proves that the self-regulating action \nof the psyche (when not disturbed by too much \nrational explanation or dissection) can support \nthe development process of the soul. \n3oi"

    "raw_text": "In Psychology and Alchemy  Dr. Jung \ndiscusses a sequence of over 1000 \ndreams produced by one man. The \nsequence revealed a striking number \nand variety of representations of the \nmandala motif—which is so often \nlinked with the realization of the \nSelf (see pp. 213 ff.). These pages \npresent a few examples of mandala \nimagery from the dreams, to indicate \nthe vastly different forms in which \nthis archetype can manifest itseif, \neven in one individual's unconscious. \nThe interpretative meanings offered \nhere may, because of their brevity, \nseem to be arbitrary assertions. In \npractice no Jungian would produce \nan interpretation of a dream without \nknowledge of the dreamer and careful \nstudy of his associations to the \ndream. These interpretative statements \nmust be taken as hints toward \npossible meanings — nothing more. \nLeft: In the dream the anima accuses \nthe man of being inattentive to her. \nA clock says five minutes to the hour. \nThe man is being \"pestered\" by his \nunconscious: the tension thus \ncreated is heightened by the clock, \nby waiting for something to happen \nin five minutes. \nBelow: A skull (which the man tries \nin vain to kick away) becomes a \nred ball, then a woman's head. \nHere the man may try to reject the \nunconscious (kicking the skull), \nbut it asserts itself by means of the \nball (perhaps alluding to the sun) \nand the anima figure.\n\f\nLeft: In part of a dream, a prince \nplaces a diamond ring on the fourth \nfinger of the dreamer's left hand. \nThe ring, worn like a wedding ring, \nindicates that the dreamer has \ntaken a \"vow\" to the Self. \nBelow left: A veiled woman uncovers \nher face, which shines like the sun. \nThe image implies an illumination \nof the unconscious (involving the \nanima) — quite different from \nconscious elucidation. \nBelow: From a transparent sphere \ncontaining small spheres, a green \nplant grows. The sphere symbolizes \nunity: the plant, life and growth. \nBelow: Troops, no longer preparing \nfor war, form an eight-rayed star \nand rotate to the left. This image \nperhaps indicates that some inner \nconflict has given way to harmony.\n\f\nConclusion: M.-L. von Franz \nScience and the unconscious \nIn the preceding chapters C. G.Jung and some \nof his associates have tried to make clear the \nrole played by the symbol-creating function in \nman's unconscious psyche and to point out some \nfields of application in this newly discovered \narea of life. We are still far from understanding \nthe unconscious or the archetypes — those dyna­\nmic nuclei of the psyche — in all their implica­\ntions. All we can see now is that the archetypes \nhave an enormous impact on the individual, \nforming his emotions and his ethical and mental \noutlook, influencing his relationships with \nothers, and thus affecting his whole destiny. We \ncan also see that the arrangement of archetypal \nsymbols follows a pattern of wholeness in the \nindividual, and that an appropriate understand­\ning of the symbols can have a healing effect. \nAnd we can see that the archetypes can act as \ncreative or destructive forces in our mind: \ncreative when they inspire new ideas, destruc­\ntive when these same ideas stiffen into con­\nscious prejudices that inhibit further discoveries. \nJung has shown in his chapter how subtle and \ndifferentiated all attempts at interpretation must \nbe, in order notto weaken the specific individual \nand cultural values of archetypal ideas and sym­\nbols by leveling them out--i.e. by giving them \na stereotyped, intellectually formulated mean­\ning.Jung himsclfdedicated his entire life to such \ninvestigations and interpretative work; natur­\nally this book sketches only an infinitesimal part \nof his vast contribution to this new field of \npsychological discovery. He was a pioneer and \nremained fully aware that an enormous number \nof further questions remained unanswered and \ncall for further investigation. This is why his \nconcepts and hypotheses are conceived on as \nwide a basis as possible (without making them \ntoo vague and all-embracing) and why his views \nform a so-called \"open system\" that does not \nclose the door against possible new discoveries. \nTo Jung, his concepts were mere tools or \nheuristic hypotheses that might help us to ex­\nplore the vast new area of reality opened up by \nthe discovery of the unconscious— a discovery \nthat has not merely widened our whole view of \nthe world but has in fact doubled it. We must \nalways ask now whether a mental phenomenon \nis conscious or unconscious and, also, whether a \n\"real\" outer phenomenon is perceived by con­\nscious or unconscious means. \nThe powerful forces of the unconscious most \ncertainly appear not only in clinical material \nbut also in the mythological, religious, artistic, \nand all the other cultural activities by which \nman expresses himself. Obviously, if all men \nhave common inherited patterns of emotional \nand mental behavior (which Jung called the \narchetypes), it is only to be expected that we \nshall find their products (symbolic fantasies, \nthoughts, and actions) in practically every field \nof human activity. \nImportant modern investigations of many of \nthese fields have been deeply influenced by \nJung's work. For instance, this influence can be \nseen in the study of literature, in such books as \nJ. B. Priestley's Literature and Western Man, \nGottfried Diener's Fausts Weg zu Helena, or \nJames Kirsch's Shakespeare's Hamlet. Simi­\nlarly, Jungian psychology has contributed to the \nstudy of art, as in the writings of Herbert Read \nor of Aniela Jaffe, Erich Neumann's examina­\ntion of Henry Moore, or Michael Tippett's \nstudies in music. Arnold Toynbee's work on his­\ntory and Paul Radin's on anthropology have \nbenefited from Jung's teachings, as have the \ncontributions to sinology made by Richard Wil-\nhelm, Enwin Rousselle, and Manfred Porkert. \nSound waves, given off by a \nvibrating steel disk and made \nvisible in a photograph, produce \na strikingly mandala-like pattern \n304"

    "raw_text": "Of course, this does not mean that the special \nfeatures of art and literature (including their \ninterpretations) can be understood only from \ntheir archetypal foundation. These fields all \nhave their own laws of activity; like all really \ncreative achievements, they cannot ultimately \nbe rationally explained. But within their areas of \naction one can recognize the archetypal patterns \nas a dynamic background activity. And one can \noften decipher in them (as in dreams) the mes­\nsage of some seemingly purposive, evolutionary \ntendency of the unconscious. \nThe fruitfulness of Jung's ideas is more imme­\ndiately understandable within the area of the \ncultural activities of man: Obviously, if the \narchetypes determine our mental behavior, they \nmust appear in all these fields. But, unexpect­\nedly, Jung's concepts have also opened up new \nways of looking at things in the realm of the \nnatural sciences as well—for instance, in \nbiology. \nThe physicist Wolfgang Pauli has pointed out \nthat, due to new discoveries, our idea of the \nevolution of life requires a revision that might \ntake into account an area of interrelation be­\ntween the unconscious psyche and biological \nprocesses. Until recently it was assumed that the \nmutation of species happened at random and \nthat a selection took place by means of which \nthe \"meaningful,\" well-adapted varieties sur­\nvived, and the others disappeared. But modern \nevolutionists have pointed out that the selections \nof such mutations by pure chance would have \ntaken much longer than the known age of our \nplanet allows. \nJung's concept of synchronicity may be help­\nful here, for it could throw light upon the occur­\nrence of certain rare \"border-phenomena,\" or \nexceptional events; thus it might explain how \n\"meaningful\" adaptations and mutations could \nhappen in less time than that required by en­\ntirely random mutations. Today we know of \nmany instances in which meaningful \"chance\" \nevents have occurred when an archetype is acti­\nvated. For example, the history of science con­\ntains many cases of simultaneous invention or \ndiscovery. One of the most famous of such cases \ninvolved Darwin and his theory of the origin of \nspecies: Darwin had developed the theory in a \nlengthy essay, and in 1844 was busy expanding \nthis into a major treatise. \nWhile he was at work on this project he \nreceived a manuscript from a young biologist, \nunknown to Darwin, named A. R. Wallace. \nThe manuscript was a shorter but otherwise \nparallel exposition of Darwin's theory. At the \ntime Wallace was in the Molucca Islands of the \nMalay Archipelago. He knew of Darwin as a \nnaturalist, but had not the slightest idea of the \nkind of theoretical work on which Darwin was \nat the time engaged. \nIn each case a creative scientist had inde­\npendently arrived at a hypothesis that was to \nchange the entire development of the science. \nAnd each had initially conceived of the hypo­\nthesis in an intuitive \"flash\" (later backed up \nby documentary evidence). The archetypes thus \nseem to appear as the agents, so to speak, of a \ncreatio continua. (What Jung calls synchronistic \nevents are in fact something like \"acts of crea­\ntion in time.\") \nSimilar \"meaningful coincidences\" can be \nsaid to occur when there is a vital necessity for \nan individual to know about, say, a relative's \ndeath, or some lost possession. In a great many \ncases such information has been revealed by \nmeans of extrasensory perception. This seems \nto suggest that abnormal random phenomena \nmay occur when a vital need or urge is aroused; \nand this in turn might explain why a species of \nanimals, under great pressure or in great need, \ncould produce \"meaningful\" (but acausal) \nchanges in its outer material structure. \nBut the most promising field for future studies \nseems (as Jung saw it) to have unexpectedly \nopened up in connection with the complex field \nof microphysics. At first sight, it seems most un­\nlikely that we should find a relationship between \npsychology and microphysics. The interrelation \nof these sciences is worth some explanation. \nThe most obvious aspect of such a connection \nlies in the fact that most of the basic concepts \nof physics (such as space, time, matter, energy, \ncontinuum or field, particle, etc.) were origin­\nally intuitive, semi-mythological, archetypal \nideas of the old Greek philosophers — ideas that \n306\n\f\nthen slowly evolved and became more accurate \nand that today are mainly expressed in abstract \nmathematical terms. The idea of a particle, for \ninstance, was formulated by the fourth-century \nB.C. Greek philosopher Leucippus and his pupil \nDemocritus, who called it the \"atom\" i.e. the \n\"indivisible unit.\" Though the atom has not \nproved indivisible, we still conceive matter ulti­\nmately as consisting of waves and particles (or \ndiscontinuous \"quanta\"). \nThe idea of energy, and its relationship to \nforce and movement, was also formulated by \nearly Greek thinkers, and was developed by \nStoic philosophers. They postulated the exist­\nence of a sort of life-giving \"tension\" (tonos), \nwhich supports and moves all things. This is \nobviously a semi-mythological germ of our \nmodern concept of energy. \nEven comparatively modern scientists and \nthinkers have relied on half-mythological, \narchetypal images when building up new con­\ncepts. In the 17th century, for instance, the \nabsolute validity of the law of causality seemed \n\"proved\" to Rene Descartes \"by the fact that \nGod is immutable in His decisions and actions.\" \nAnd the great German astronomer Johannes \nKepler asserted that there arc not more and not \nless than three dimensions of space on account \nof the Trinity. \nThese are just two examples among many \nthat show how even our modern and basic \nscientific concepts remained for a long time \nlinked with archetypal ideas that originally \ncame from the unconscious. They do not neces­\nsarily express \"objective\" facts (or at least we \ncannot prove that they ultimately do) butspring \nfrom innate mental tendencies in man — tenden­\ncies that induce him to find \"satisfactory\" \nrational explanatory connections between the \nvarious outer and inner facts with which he has \nto deal. When examining nature and the uni­\nverse, instead of looking for and finding objec­\ntive qualities, \"man encounters himself,\" in the \nphrase of the physicist Werner Heisenberg. \nBecause of the implications of this point of \nview, Wolfgang Pauli and other scientists have \nbegun to study the role of archetypal symbolism \nin the realm of scientific concepts. Pauli be­\nlieved that we should parallel our investigation \nof outer objects with a psychological investiga­\ntion of the inner origin of our scientific con­\ncepts. (This investigation might shed new light \non a far-reaching concept to be introduced later \nin this chapter—the concept of a \"one-ness\" \nbetween the physical and psychological spheres, \nquantitative and qualitative aspects of reality.) \nBesides this rather obvious link between the \npsychology of the unconscious and physics, there, \nare other even more fascinating connections. \nJung (working closely with Pauli) discovered \nthat analytical psychology has been forced by \ninvestigations in its own field to create concepts \nthat turned out later to be strikingly similar to \nthose created by the physicists when confronted \nwith microphysical phenomena. One of the most \nimportant among the physicists' concepts is \nNiels Bohr's idea of complementarity. \nModern microphysics has discovered that one \ncan describe light only by means of two logic­\nally opposed but complementary concepts: The \nideas of particle and wave. In grossly simplified \nterms, it might be said that under certain ex­\nperimental conditions light manifests itself as if \nit were composed of particles; under others, as \nThe American physicist Mrs. Maria \nMayer, who in 1963 shared the Nobel \nprize for physics Her discovery— \nconcerning the constituents of the \natomic nucleus— was made like so \nmany other scientific discoveries: \nin an intuitive flash of insight \n(sparked by a colleague's chance \nremark). Her theory indicates that \nthe nucleus consists of concentric \nshells: The innermost contains two \nprotons or two neutrons, the next \ncontains eight of one or the other, \nand so on through what she calls the \n\"magic numbers\"—20, 28, 50, 82.1 26 \nThere is an obvious link between this \nmodel and the archetypes of the \nsphere and of numbers 3<>7\n\f\nif it were a wave. Also, it was discovered that we \ncan accurately observe either the position or the \nvelocity of a subatomic particle - but not both \nat once. The observer must choose his experi­\nmental set-up, but by doing so he excludes (or \nrather must \"sacrifice\") some other possible set­\nup and its results. Furthermore, the measuring \napparatus has to be included in the description \nof events because it has a decisive but uncontrol­\nlable influence upon the experimental set-up. \nPauli says: \"The science of microphysics, on \naccount of the basic 'complementary' situation, \nis faced with the impossibility of eliminating the \neffects of the observer by determinable correc­\ntives and has therefore to abandon in principle \nany objective understanding of physical pheno­\nmena. Where classical physics still saw 'deter­\nmined causal natural laws of nature' we now \nlook only for 'statistical laws' with 'primary \npossibilities.' \" \nIn other words, in microphysics the observer \ninterferes with the experiment in a way that \ncannot be measured and that therefore cannot \nbe eliminated. No natural laws can be formu­\nlated, saying \"such-and-such will happen in \nevery case.\" All the microphysicist can say is \n\"such-and-such is, according to statistical \nprobability, likely to happen.\" This naturally \nrepresents a tremendous problem for our \nclassical physical thinking. It requires a con­\nsideration, in a scientific experiment, of the \nmental outlook of the participant-observer: It \ncould thus be said that scientists can no longer \nhope to describe any aspects of outer objects in \na completely \"objective\" manner. \nMost modern physicists have accepted the \nfact that the role played by the conscious ideas \nof an observer in every microphysical experi­\nment cannot be eliminated; but they have not \nconcerned themselves with the possibility that \nthe total psychological condition (both conscious \nand unconscious) of the observer might play a \nrole as well. As Pauli points out, however, we \nhave at least no a priori reasons for rejecting \nthis possibility. But we must look at this as a still \nunanswered and an unexplored problem. \nBohr's idea of complementarity is especially \ninteresting to Jungian psychologists, for Jung \nsaw that the relationship between the conscious \nand unconscious mind also forms a complemen­\ntary pair of opposites. Each new content that \ncomes up from the unconscious is altered in its \nbasic nature by being partly integrated into the \nconscious mind of the observer. Even dream \ncontents (if noticed at all) are in that way \nsemi-conscious. And each enlargement of the \nobserver's consciousness caused by dream inter­\npretation has again an immeasurable repercus­\nsion and influence on the unconscious. Thus the \nunconscious can only be approximately de­\nscribed (like the particles of microphysics] by \nparadoxical concepts. What it really is \"in \nitself\" we shall never know, just as we shall \nnever know this about matter. \nTo take the parallels between psychology and \nmicrophysics even further: What Jung calls the \narchetypes (or patterns of emotional and mental \nbehavior in man) could just as well be called, \nto use Pauli's term, \"primary possibilities\" of \npsychic reactions. As has been stressed in this \nbook, there are no laws governing the specific \nform in which an archetype might appear. \nThere are only \"tendencies\" (see p. 67) that, \nagain, enable us to say only that such-and-such \nis likely to happen in certain psychological \nsituations. \nAs the American psychologist William James \nonce pointed out, the idea of an unconscious \ncould itself be compared to the \"field\" concept \nin physics. We might say that, just as in a mag­\nnetic field the particles entering into it appear \nin a certain order, psychological contents also \nappear in an ordered way within that psychic \narea which we call the unconscious. If we call \nsomething \"rational\" or \"meaningful\" in our \nconscious mind, and accept it as a satisfactory \n\"explanation\" of things, it is probably due to \nthe fact that our conscious explanation is in \nharmony with some preconscious constellation \nof contents in our unconscious. \nIn other words, our conscious representations \nare sometimes ordered (or arranged in a pat­\ntern) before they have become conscious to us. \nThe 19th-century German mathematician Karl \nFriedrich Gauss gives an example of an experi­\nence of such an unconscious order of ideas: He \n308\n\f\nsays that he found a certain rule in the theory \nof numbers \"not by painstaking research, but \nby the Grace of God, so to speak. The riddle \nsolved itself as lightning strikes, and I myself \ncould not tell or show the connection between \nwhat I knew before, what I last used to experi­\nment with, and what produced the final suc­\ncess.\" The French scientist Henri Poincare is \neven more explicit about this phenomenon; he \ndescribes how during a sleepless night he actu­\nally watched his mathematical representations \ncolliding in him until some of them \"found a \nmore stable connection. One feels as if one \ncould watch one's own unconscious at work, the \nunconscious activity partially becoming mani­\nfest to consciousness without losing its own \ncharacter. At such moments one has an intui­\ntion of the difference between the mechanisms \nof the two egos.\" \nAs a final example of parallel developments \nin microphysics and, psychology, we can con­\nsider Jung's concept of meaning. Where before \nmen looked for causal (i.e. rational) explana­\ntions of phenomena, Jung introduced the idea \nof looking for the meaning (or, perhaps we \ncould say, the \"purpose\"). That is, rather than \nask why something happened (i.e. what caused \nit), Jung asked : What did it happen for? This \nsame tendency appears in physics: Many \nmodern physicists are now looking more for \n\"connections\" in nature than for causal laws \n(determinism). \nPauli expected that the idea of the uncon­\nscious would spread beyond the \"narrow frame \nof therapeutic use\" and would influence all \nnatural sciences that deal with general life \nphenomena. Since Pauli suggested this develop­\nment he has been echoed by some physicists who \nare concerned with the new science of cyberne­\ntics— the comparative study of the \"control\" \nsystem formed by the brain and nervous system \nand such mechanical or electronic information \nand control systems as computers. In short, as \nthe modern French scientist Oliver Costa de \nBeauregard has put it, science and psychology \nshould in future \"enter into an active dialogue.\" \nThe unexpected parallelisms of ideas in \npsychology and physics suggest, as Jung pointed \nout, a possible ultimate one-ness of both fields of \nreality that physics and psychology study—i.e. \na psychophysical one-ness of all life phenomena. \nJung was even convinced that what he calls \nthe unconscious somehow links up with the \nstructure of inorganic matter—a link to which \nthe problem of so-called \"psychosomatic\" ill­\nness seems to point. The concept of a unitarian \nidea of reality (which has been followed up by \nPauli and Erich Neumann) was called by Jung \nthe unus mundus (the one world, within which \nmatter and psyche are not yet discriminated or \nseparately actualized). He paved the way to­\nward such a unitarian point of view by pointing \nout that an archetype shows a \"psychoid\" (i.e. \nnot purely psychic but almost material) aspect \nwhen it appears within a synchronistic event— \nfor such an event is in effect a meaningful \narrangement of inner psychic and outer facts. \nIn other words, the archetypes not only fit \ninto outer situations (as animal patterns of be­\nhavior fit into their surrounding nature); at \nbottom they tend to become manifest in a syn­\nchronistic \"arrangement\" that includes both \nmatter and psyche. But these statements are just \nhints at some directions in which the investiga­\ntion of life phenomena might proceed. Jung \nfelt that we should first learn a great deal more \nabout the interrelation of these two areas (mat­\nter and psyche) before rushing into too many \nabstract speculations about it. \nThe field that Jung himself felt would be most \nfruitful for further investigations was the study \nof our basic mathematical axiomata—which \nPauli calls \"primary mathematical intuitions,\" \nand among which he especially mentions the \nideas of an infinite series of numbers in arith­\nmetic, or of a continuum in geometry, etc. As \nthe German-born author Hannah Arendt has \nsaid, \"with the rise of modernity, mathematics \ndo not simply enlarge their content or reach out \ninto the infinite to become applicable to the \nimmensity of an infinite and infinitely growing, \nexpanding universe, but cease to be concerned \nwith appearance at all. They are no longer the \nbeginnings of philosophy, or the 'science' of \nBeing in its true appearance, but become \ninstead the science of the structure of the \n309\n\f\nhuman mind.\" (A Jungian would at once add \nthe question: Which mind? The conscious or \nthe unconscious mind?) \nAs we have seen with reference to the \nexperiences of Gauss and Poincare, the mathe­\nmaticians also discovered the fact that our \nrepresentations are \"ordered\" before we become \naware of them. B. L. van der Waerden, who \ncites many examples of essential mathematical \ninsights arising from the unconscious, concludes: \n\"... the unconscious is not only able to associate \nand combine, but even to judge. The judgment of \nthe unconscious is an intuitive one, but it is under \nfavorable circumstance's completely sure.\" \nAmong the many mathematical primary in­\ntuitions, or a priori ideas, the \"natural num­\nbers\" seem psychologically the most interesting. \nNot only do they serve our conscious everyday \nmeasuring and counting operations; they have \nfor centuries been the only existing means for \n\"reading\" the meaning of such ancient forms of \ndivination as astrology, numerology, geomancy, \netc. all of which are based on arithmetical \ncomputation and all of,which have been inves­\ntigated by Jung in terms of his theory of syn­\nchronicity. Furthermore, the natural numbers \n— viewed from a psychological angle — must cer­\ntainly be archetypal representations, for we are \nforced to think about them in certain definite \nways. Nobody, for instance, can deny that 2 is \nthe only existing even primary number, even if \nhe has never thought about it consciously \nbefore. In other words, numbers are not con­\ncepts consciously invented by men for purposes \nof calculation: They are spontaneous and \nautonomous products of the unconscious — as \nare other archetypal symbols. \nBut the natural numbers are also qualities \nadherent to outer objects: We can assert and \ncount that there are two stones here or three \ntrees there. Even if we strip outer objects of all \nsuch qualities as color, temperature, size, etc., \nthere still remains their \"many-ness\" or special \nmultiplicity. Yet these same numbers are also \njust as indisputably parts of our own mental \nset-up — abstract concepts that we can study \nwithout looking at outer objects. Numbers thus \nappear to be a tangible connection between the \nspheres of matter and psyche. According to hints \ndropped by Jung, it is here that the most fruit­\nful field of further investigation might be found. \nI mention these rather difficult concepts \nbriefly in order to show that, to me, Jung's ideas \ndo not form a \"doctrine\" but are the beginning \nof a new outlook that will continue to evolve \nand expand. I hope they will give the reader \na glimpse into what seems to me to have been \nessential to and typical of Jung's scientific atti­\ntude. He was always searching, with unusual \nfreedom from conventional prejudices, and at \nthe same time with great modesty and accuracy, \nto understand the phenomenon of life. He did \nnot go further into the ideas mentioned above, \nbecause he felt that he had not yet enough \nfacts in hand to say anything relevant about \nthem—just as he generally waited several years \nbefore publishing his new insights, checking \nthem again and again in the meantime, and \nhimself raising every possible doubt about them. \nTherefore, what might at first sight strike the \nreader as a certain vagueness in his ideas comes \nin fact from this scientific attitude of intellectual \nmodesty- -an attitude that does not exclude (by \nrash, superficial pseudo-explanations and over­\nsimplifications) new possible discoveries, and \nthat respects the complexity of the phenomenon \nof life. For this phenomenon was always an \nexciting mystery to Jung. It was never, as it is \nfor people with closed minds, an \"explained\" \nreality about which it can be assumed that we \nknow everything. \nCreative ideas, in my opinion, show their \nvalue in that, like keys, they help to \"unlock\" \nhitherto unintelligible connections of facts and \nthus enable man to penetrate deeper into the \nmystery of life. I am convinced that Jung's \nideas can serve in this way to find and interpret \nnew facts in many fields of science (and also of \neveryday life), simultaneously leading the indi­\nvidual to a more balanced, more ethical, and \nwider conscious outlook. If the reader should \nfeel stimulated to work further on the investi­\ngation and assimilation of the unconscious— \nwhich always begins by working on oneself— \nthe purpose of this introductory book would be \nfulfilled. \n310\n\f\nNotes \nApproaching the unconscious C.

Richard Wilhelm (with \nan introduction by C. G.Jung), Routledge and Kegan \nPaul, London, 1951, vols. I and II. \n292 The symbolism in the three upper lines of the sign \nMeng the \"gate\" is mentioned in op. cit., vol. 11, \np. 299, which also states that this sign \". . . is a bypath, \nit means little stones, doors and openings . . . eunuchs \nand watchmen, the fingers . . .\" For the sign Meng, see \nalso vol. I, p. 20 ff. \n292 The quotation from the / Ching is in vol. I, p. 23. \n292 Concerning a second consulting of the / Ching, Jung \nwrites (in his Introduction to the English edition, \np. x): \"A repetition of the experiment is impossible for \nthe simple reason that the original situation cannot \nbe reconstructed. Therefore in each instance there is \nonly a first and single answer.\" \n292 For the commentary on the sign Li, see op. cit., vol. \nI„ p. 178; and a reference in vol. II, p. 299. \n293 The motif of the \"city on the mountain\" is discussed \nby K. Kerenyi in Das Ceheimnis der hohen Sl'ddte, \nEuropdische Revue, 1942, Juli-August-Heft; and in Essays \non a Science of Mythology, Bollingen Series XXIII, p. 16. \n294 Jung's discussions of the motif of four appear, for \ninstance, in his Collected Works, vol. IX, XI, XII, and \nXIV; but the problem of the four, with all its impli­\ncations, is woven like a red thread through all his works. \n297 For some of the symbolic meanings ascribed to \nplaying cards, see Handworterbuch des Deutschen Aberglaubens, \nvol. IV, p. 1015, and vol. V, p. 1 110. \n297 The symbolism of the number nine is discussed in \n(among other works) F. V. Hopper's Medieval Number \nSymbolism, 1938, p. 138. \n299 Concerning the \"night-sea-journey\" pattern of this \ndream, see J. Jacobi, \"The Process of Individuation,\" \nJournal of Analytical Psychology, vol. Ill, no. 2, 1958, p. 95. \n300 The primitive belief in the power of bodily secretions \nis discussed by E. Neumann in Origins of Consciousness \n(German edition), p. 39. \nScience and the unconscious M.-L. von Franz \n304 The archetypes as nuclei of the psvche are discussed \nby W. Pauli in Aufsdirj und Vortrdge iiber Physik und \nErkennlnis-iheorie, Verlag Vieweg Braunschweig. 1961. \n304 Concerning the inspiring or inhibiting power of the \narchetypes, see C. G.Jung and W. Pauli, Naturerkldrung \nund Psyche, Zurich, 1952, p. 163 and passim. \n306 Pauli's suggestion concerning biology appears in \nAufsdtze und Vortrdge, op. cit., p. 123. \n306 For further explanation of the statement concerning \nthe time required for mutation, see Pauli, op. cit., pp. 123-25. \n306 The story of Darwin and Wallace can be found in \nHenshaw Ward's Charles Darwin, 1927. \n307 The reference to Descartes is expanded in M.-L. von \nFranz's \"Der Traum des Descartes,\" in Studien des C. C. \nJung Instituts, called \"Zeitlose Dokuments der Seele.\" \n307 Kepler's assertion is discussed by Jung and Pauli \nin Naturerkldrung und Psyche, op. at., p. 117. \n307 Heisenberg's phrase was quoted by Hannah Arendt \nin The Human Condition, Chicago Univ. Press, 1958, p. 26. \n307 Pauli's suggestion of parallel psychological and \nphysical studies appears in Naturerkldrung, op. at., p. 163. \n307 For Niels Bohr's ideas of complementarity, see his \nAtomphysik und menschliche Erkennln/s, Braunschweig, p. 26 ff. \n308 \"Momentum\" (of a subatomic particle) is, in \n(ierman, Bewegungsgrosse. \n308 The statement quoted from Pauli was quoted by \nJung in \"The Spirit of Psychology,\" in Jos. Campbell's \nColl. Papers of the Eranos Year Book, Bollingen Series XXX, \n1, N.Y. Pantheon Books, 1954, p. 439. \n308 Pauli discusses the \"primary possibilities\" in \nVortrdge, op. cit., p. 125. \n308 The parallels between microphysics and \npsychological concepts also appear in Vortrdge: the \ndescription of the unconscious by paradoxes, pp. 1 15-16; \nthe archetypes as \"primary possibilities,\" p. 115; the \nunconscious as a \"field,\" p. 125. \n309 The quotation from Gauss is translated from his \nWerke, vol. X, p. 25, letter to Olbcrs, and is quoted in B. L. \nvan der Waerden, Einfall und Ueberlegung: Drei klane \nBeitrdge zur Psychologic des mathematischen Denkens, \nBasel,1 1954. \n309 Poincare's statement is quoted in ibid., p. 2. \n309 Pauli's belief that the concept of the unconscious \nwould affect all natural sciences is in Vortrdge, p. 125. \n309 The idea of the possible one-ness of life phenomena \nwas taken up by Pauli, ibid., p. 118. \n309 For Jung's ideas on the \"synchronistic arrangement\" \nincluding matter and psyche, see his \"Synchronicity: An \nAcausal Connecting Principle,\" Coll. Works vol. VIII. \n309 Jung's idea of the unus mundus follows some medieval \nphilosophic ideas in scholasticism (John Duns Scotus, \netc.) : The unus mundus was the total or archetypal \nconcept of the world in God's mind before he put it into \nactual reality. \n309 The quotation from Hannah Arendt appears in \nThe Human Condition, op. at., p. 266. \n309 For further discussion of \"primary mathematical \nintuitions,\" see Pauli, Vortrdge, p. 122; and also Ferd. \nConseth, \"Les mathematiques et la realite,\" 1948. \n310 Pauli, following Jung, points out that our conscious \nrepresentations are \"ordered\" before becoming conscious \nin Vortrdge, p. 122. See also Conseth, op. at. \n310 B. L. van der Waerden's statement is from his \nEinfall und Ueberlegung, op. at., p. 9. \n3'5"

They show the nature and \nfunction of dreams; explore the sym­\nbolic meaning of modern art; and re­\nveal the psychological meanings of the \nordinary experiences of everyday life. \nThey are a reinforcement to Jung's \nthought and an integral part of MAN \nAND His SYMBOLS. \n.. [Contemporary man] is blind to \nthe fact that, with all his rationality \nand efficiency, he is possessed by 'pow­\ners' liiiu are beyond his control. His \ngods and demons have not disappeared \nat all; they have merely got new names. \nThey keep him on the run with rest­\nlessness, vague apprehensions, psycho­\nlogical complications, an insatiable \nneed for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food— \nand, above all, an impressive array of \nneuroses.\" \nCarl Gustav Jung \nTibetan Mandala photo Realit6s Paris. \nPrinted in Spain\n\f\nMan and his Symbols \nCarl G.Jung"
