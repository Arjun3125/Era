    "raw_text": "Preface\nI started working at an intelligence agency in August 2001. A few\nweeks later, the world changed forever.\nEveryone at the agency suddenly found themselves thrust into\npositions and responsibilities they weren’t ready for. My job\ninvolved constantly ﬁguring out how to do things few had even\nimagined possible. Not only did I need to solve complicated and\nnew problems, but people’s lives were at stake. Failure was not an\noption.\nOne night, I was walking home at 3:00 a.m. after one of our\noperations. The outcome wasn’t what I had hoped for. I knew I’d\nhave to face my boss in the morning and explain what happened\nand what I’d been thinking when I made the choices I did.\nHad I thought everything through clearly? Was there something I\nmissed? How was I to know?\nMy thinking would be laid bare for everyone to see and judge.\nI walked into my boss’s oﬃce the next day and explained what\nwent through my mind. When I ﬁnished, I told him I wasn’t ready\nfor this job or the level of responsibility it required. He put his pen\ndown, drew a deep breath, and said, “No one is ready for this job,\nShane. But you and this team are all we got.”\nHis response wasn’t exactly comforting. By “team” he meant\ntwelve people working eighty hours a week for years. By “all we\ngot” he meant starting the most important new program the agency\nhad seen in generations. I walked away from our brief encounter\nwith my head spinning.\nThat night I started asking myself questions that I’d continue\nexploring for the next decade. How can we get better at reasoning?\nWhy do people make bad decisions? Why do some people\nconsistently get better results than others who have the same\ninformation? How can I be right more often, and decrease the\n\f\nprobability of a bad outcome when lives are on the line?\nUp until that point in my career, I’d been fairly lucky, and while\nI wanted that luck to continue, I also wanted to depend on it less. If\nthere was a method for clear thinking and good judgment—I\nwanted to harness it.\nIf you’re like me, no one ever taught you how to think or make\ndecisions. There’s no class called Clear Thinking 101 in school.\nEveryone seems to expect you to know how to do it already or to\nlearn how on your own. As it turns out, though, learning about\nthinking—thinking clearly—is surprisingly hard.\nFor the next several years, I devoted myself to learning how to\nthink better. I watched how people acquired information, reasoned,\nand acted in practice, and how their actions unfolded into positive\nor negative outcomes. Were some people just smarter than others?\nOr did they have better systems or practices in place? In the\nmoments that mattered, were people even aware of the quality of\ntheir thinking? How could I avoid the obvious errors?\nI followed the most senior people around to meetings. I’d sit\nthere quietly[*]* listening to what they thought was important and\nwhy. I read anything I could on cognition and talked to anyone who\nwould pick up the phone.\nI sought out the titans of industry[*] who seemed to consistently\nthink clearly even when others couldn’t. They seemed to know\nsomething that was not commonly known, and I was determined to\nﬁnd out what.\nWhile the rest of us are chasing victory, the best in the world\nknow they must avoid losing before they can win. It turns out this is\na surprisingly eﬀective strategy.\nTo catalog my learning, I created an anonymous website called\nFarnam Street, found at fs.blog, named in honor of Charlie Munger\nand Warren Buﬀett,[*] two people who exercise judgment for a\nliving and who have had a profound impact on how I see the world.\n[*] I’ve been fortunate over the years to talk to my heroes Charlie\nMunger and Daniel Kahneman about thinking and decision-making,\nalong with other master practitioners like Bill Ackman, Annie Duke,\nAdam Robinson, Randall Stutman, and Kat Cole. Many of these\nconversations are public on The Knowledge Project podcast. Others,\n\f\nlike my time spent with Munger, must remain private. Among all\nthe people I’ve spoken with, though, no one has inﬂuenced my\nthinking and ideas more than my friend Peter D. Kaufman.\nThousands of conversations have yielded a key insight.\nIn order to get the results we desire, we must do two things. We\nmust ﬁrst create the space to reason in our thoughts, feelings, and\nactions; and second, we must deliberately use that space to think\nclearly. Once you have mastered this skill, you will ﬁnd you have\nan unstoppable advantage.\nDecisions made through clear thinking will put you in\nincreasingly better positions, and success will only compound from\nthere.\nThis book is a practical guide to mastering clear thinking.\nThe ﬁrst half of the book is about creating space for it. First, we\nidentify the enemies of clear thinking. You will learn how most of\nwhat we consider to be “thinking” is in fact reacting without\nreasoning, prompted by biological instincts that evolved to preserve\nour species. When we react without reasoning, our position is\nweakened, and our options get increasingly worse. When we\nritualize a response to our biological triggers, we create the space to\nthink clearly, and strengthen our position. Then, we identify a\nnumber of practical, actionable ways to both manage your\nweaknesses and build your strengths so that space is consistently\ncreated when you’re under pressure.\nThe second half of the book is about putting clear thinking into\npractice. Once you are in a place where you’ve shored up your\nstrengths and managed your weaknesses—when you’ve created the\npause between thought and action—you can turn clear thinking\ninto eﬀective decisions. In Part 4 I share the most practical tools\nyou can use to solve problems.\nFinally, once you have mastered the skills of making your\ndefaults work for instead of against you and maximizing the tool\nthat is your rational mind, I’ll turn to perhaps the most important\nquestion of all: the question of what your goals are in the ﬁrst\nplace. All the successful execution in the world is worthless if it’s\nnot in service of the right outcome, but how do you decide what\nthat is?\n\f\nAlong the way, I’ll show you the most eﬀective approaches to\nthinking in a way few people talk about. We won’t use fancy jargon,\nspreadsheets, or decision trees. Instead, we’ll focus on the practical\nskills I’ve learned from others, discovered on my own, and tested on\nthousands of people from various organizations, cultures, and\nindustries.\nTogether we’ll uncover the missing link between behavioral\nscience and real-world results and turn ordinary moments into\nextraordinary results.\nThe lessons in this book are simple, practical, and timeless. They\ndraw heavily on the wisdom of others and my own lived experience\nputting them into practice. I relied on these lessons and insights to\nmake better decisions inside the intelligence agency, build and scale\nmultiple businesses, and surprisingly become a better parent. How\nyou use them is up to you.\nIf there is a tagline to my life, it is “Mastering the best of what\nother people have already ﬁgured out,” and this book is a tribute to\nthat belief. I’ve done my best to attribute those ideas to the people\nwho deserve the credit. I’ve probably missed some, and for that I\napologize. When you put things into practice, they become part of\nyou. After two decades, thousands of conversations with the best in\nthe world, and more books devoured than I can count, it’s not easy\nto remember where everything comes from. Most of it has just been\ningrained into my unconscious. It’s safe to assume that anything\nuseful in this book is someone else’s idea, and that my main\ncontribution is to put the mosaic of what I’ve learned from others\nwho came before me out there for the world."

    "raw_text": "introduction\nThe Power of Clear Thinking in Ordinary Moments\nWhat happens in ordinary moments determines your future.\nWe’re taught to focus on the big decisions, rather than the\nmoments where we don’t even realize we’re making a choice. Yet\nthese ordinary moments often matter more to our success than the\nbig decisions. This can be diﬃcult to appreciate.\nWe think that if only we get the big things right, everything will\nmagically fall into place. If we choose to marry the right person, it’ll\nall be okay. If we choose the right career, we’ll be happy. If we pick\nthe right investment, we’ll be rich. This wisdom is, at best, partially\ntrue. You can marry the most amazing person in the world, but if\nyou take them for granted, it will end. You can pick the best career,\nbut if you don’t work your butt oﬀ, you won’t get opportunities.\nYou can ﬁnd the perfect investment, only to look at your savings\naccount and have nothing to invest. Even when we get the big\ndecisions directionally right, we’re not guaranteed to get the results\nwe want.\nWe don’t think of ordinary moments as decisions. No one taps us\non the shoulder as we react to a comment by a coworker to tell us\nthat we’re about to pour either gasoline or water onto this ﬂame. Of\ncourse, if we knew we were about to make the situation worse, we\nwouldn’t. No one tries to win the moment at the expense of the\ndecade, and yet that is often how it goes.\nThe enemies of clear thinking—the more primal parts of our\nnature—make it hard to see what’s happening and instead just\nmake our lives more challenging. When we react with emotion to a\ncolleague in a meeting, we must make amends. When we make a\ndecision to prove we’re right rather than get the best outcome\n\f\npossible, we only end up with a mess to clean up later. If we start\nbickering with our partner on Friday, the entire weekend can be\nlost. No wonder we have less energy, more stress, and feel busy all\nthe time.\nIn most ordinary moments the situation thinks for us. We don’t\nrealize it at the time because these moments seem so insigniﬁcant.\nHowever, as days turn into weeks and weeks into months, the\naccumulation of these moments makes accomplishing our goals\neasier or harder.\nEach moment puts you in a better or worse position to handle\nthe future. It’s that positioning that eventually makes life easier or\nharder. When our ego takes over and we show someone we’re the\nboss, we make the future harder. When we are passive-aggressive\nwith a colleague at work, our relationship becomes worse. And\nwhile these moments don’t seem to matter much at the time, they\ncompound into our current position. And our position determines\nour future.\nA good position allows you to think clearly rather than be forced\nby circumstances into a decision. One reason the best in the world\nmake consistently good decisions is they rarely ﬁnd themselves\nforced into a decision by circumstances.\nYou don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if\nyou can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when they’re\nin a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot\nwhen they’re in a bad one.\nThe greatest aid to judgment is starting from a good position.\nThe company with cash on the balance sheet and low debt has\nnothing but good options to choose from. When bad times come,\nand they always do, their options go from good to great. On the\nother hand, a company with no cash and high debt has nothing but\nbad options to choose from. Things quickly go from bad to worse.\nAnd this example easily extends beyond the boardroom as well.\nTime is the friend of someone who is properly positioned and the\nenemy of someone poorly positioned. When you are well\npositioned, there are many paths to victory. If you are poorly\npositioned, there may be only one. You can think of this a bit like\nplaying Tetris. When you play well, you have many options for\n\f\nwhere to put the next piece. When you play poorly, you need just\nthe right piece.\nWhat a lot of people miss is that ordinary moments determine\nyour position, and your position determines your options. Clear\nthinking is the key to proper positioning, which is what allows you\nto master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them.\nIt doesn’t matter what position you ﬁnd yourself in right now.\nWhat matters is whether you improve your position today.\nEvery ordinary moment is an opportunity to make the future\neasier or harder. It all depends on whether you’re thinking clearly."

You will never\nknow all of its secrets.\n—CORDELIA FINE, A Mind of Its Own: How Your Brain\nDistorts and Deceives\nTHE FIRST THING I heard was shouting. Generally, this is not what you\nexpect to hear when approaching the CEO’s oﬃce. This CEO was\ndiﬀerent.\nI walked into his oﬃce, put my briefcase on the table, and sat\ndown directly across from him. He didn’t acknowledge my presence.\nWhile months of working for him had led me to expect as much, it\nwas still unsettling.\nI was his designated right hand, and almost nothing and no one\ngot to him without going through me ﬁrst. That’s what made this call\nso interesting. It wasn’t on his calendar.\nWhomever he was talking with, the conversation had turned him\nred with rage. I had already learned the hard way not to interrupt him\nduring moments like this with a nudge to take a breath. If I did, his\nwrath would quickly direct itself at me.\nAs he hung up, his eyes met mine. I knew I had a split second to\nsay something, or he’d start yelling at me for having to take this\nunscheduled call.\n“What was that all about?” I asked.\n“They needed to be put in their place,” he said.\n\f\nI didn’t know who had been on the other end of the phone, but\nthe pitch of his anger led me to believe it was someone unfamiliar\nwith him. The people who worked for this CEO knew it was easier\nnot to tell him anything that might upset him. This included bad\nnews, ideas that clashed with his beliefs, and of course a nudge to\nstop when he was making a situation worse.\nIt would be one of the last calls he ever took in his oﬃce. This\nordinary moment changed everything.\nIt turned out, the person on the other end of that phone call was\ndesperately trying to report a problem with serious consequences for\nthe organization. When their concern was met with wrath that day,\nthey decided to take their concerns to the board. Not long afterward,\nthe CEO was ﬁred.\nWhile part of me wants to tell you it was directly because of his\nbehavior, we both know that wouldn’t be true. He was ﬁred for not\nacting on the very information the person on the other end of the\nphone was trying to tell him, because his ego wouldn’t allow for it. If\nhe had been thinking clearly, he might still have his job.[*]*\n⦁"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 1.1\nThinking Badly—or Not Thinking at All?\nRationality is wasted if you don’t know when to use it.\nWhen you ask people about improving thinking, they typically\npoint toward numerous tools designed to help people think more\nrationally. Bookstores are full of books that assume the problem is\nour ability to reason. They list the steps we should take and the\ntools we should use to exercise better judgment. If you know you\nshould be thinking, these can be helpful.\nWhat I’ve learned from watching real people in action is that,\njust like the angry CEO, they’re often unaware circumstances are\nthinking for them. It’s as if we expect the inner voice in our head to\nsay, “STOP! THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN YOU NEED TO THINK!”\nAnd because we don’t know we should be thinking, we cede\ncontrol to our impulses.\nIn the space between stimulus and response, one of two things\ncan happen. You can consciously pause and apply reason to the\nsituation. Or you can cede control and execute a default behavior.\nThe problem is, our default behavior often makes things worse.\nWhen someone slights us, we lash out with angry words.\nWhen someone cuts us oﬀ, we assume malice on their part.\nWhen things go slower than we want, we become frustrated and\nimpatient.\nWhen someone is passive-aggressive, we take the bait and\nescalate.\nIn these moments of reaction, we don’t realize that our brains\nhave been hijacked by our biology, and that the outcome will go\nagainst what we seek. We don’t realize that hoarding information to\ngain an advantage is hurting the team. We don’t realize we’re\n\f\nconforming to the group’s ideas when we should be thinking for\nourselves. We don’t realize our emotions are making us react in\nways that create problems downstream.\nSo our ﬁrst step in improving our outcomes is to train ourselves\nto identify the moments when judgment is called for in the ﬁrst\nplace, and pause to create space to think clearly. This training takes\na lot of time and eﬀort, because it involves counterbalancing our\nhardwired biological defaults evolved over many centuries. But\nmastery over the ordinary moments that make the future easier or\nharder is not only possible, it’s the critical ingredient to success and\nachieving your long-term goals.\nThe High Cost of Losing Control\nReacting without reasoning makes every situation worse.\nConsider a common scenario that I’ve seen countless times. A\ncoworker slights a project you’re leading in a meeting. Instinctively\nyou hit back with a comment that undermines them or their work.\nYou didn’t make a conscious choice to respond, you just did. Before\nyou even know what’s happening, the damage is done. Not only\ndoes the relationship suﬀer but the meeting goes sideways.\nToo much energy is then consumed getting you back to where\nyou were. The relationship needs to be repaired. The derailed\nmeeting needs to be rescheduled. You might need to talk to the\nother people in the meeting to clear the air. And even after all of\nthis, you might still be worse oﬀ than you were before. Every\nwitness and every person they talked to about what happened\nreceived an unconscious signal that eroded their trust in you.\nRebuilding that trust takes months of consistent behavior.\nAll the time and energy you spend ﬁxing your unforced errors\ncomes at the expense of moving toward the outcomes you want.\nThere is a huge advantage in having more of your energy instead go\ntoward achieving your goals instead of ﬁxing your problems. The\nperson who learns how to think clearly ultimately applies more of\ntheir overall eﬀort toward the outcomes they want than the person\nwho doesn’t.\nYou have little hope of thinking clearly, though, if you can’t"

    "raw_text": "manage your defaults.\nBiological Instincts\nThere’s nothing stronger than biological instincts. They control us\noften without us even knowing. Failing to come to terms with them\nonly makes you more susceptible to their inﬂuence.\nIf you’re having trouble understanding why you sometimes react\nto situations in the worst possible way, the problem isn’t your mind.\nYour mind is doing exactly what biology programmed it to do: act\nquickly and eﬃciently in response to threats, without wasting\nvaluable time thinking.\nIf someone breaks into your house, you instinctively stand\nbetween them and your kids. If someone approaches you with a\nmenacing expression, you tense up. If you sense your job is at risk,\nyou might unconsciously start hoarding information. Your animal\nbrain believes you can’t be ﬁred if you’re the only one who knows\nhow to do your job. Biology, not your rational mind, told you what\nto do.\nWhen our unthinking reactions make situations worse, that little\nvoice in our head starts to beat us up: “What were you thinking,\nyou idiot?” The truth of the matter is, you weren’t thinking. You\nwere reacting, exactly like the animal you are. Your mind wasn’t in\ncharge. Your biology was.\nOur biological tendencies are hardwired within us.[*] Those\ntendencies often served our prehistoric ancestors well, but they tend\nto get in our way today. These timeless behaviors have been\ndescribed and discussed by philosophers and scientists from\nAristotle and the Stoics to Daniel Kahneman and Jonathan Haidt.[1]\nFor instance, like all animals, we are naturally prone to defend\nour territory.[2] We might not be defending a piece of terrain on\nthe African savanna, but territory isn’t just physical, it’s also\npsychological. Our identity is part of our territory too. When\nsomeone criticizes our work, status, or how we see ourselves, we\ninstinctively shut down or defend ourselves. When someone\nchallenges our beliefs, we stop listening and go on the attack. No\nthoughts, just pure animal instinct.\n\f\nWe’re naturally wired to organize the world into a\nhierarchy. We do this to help make sense of the world, maintain\nour beliefs, and generally feel better. But when someone infringes\non our place in the world and our understanding of how it works,\nwe react without thinking. When someone cuts you oﬀ on the\nhighway and road rage kicks in, that’s your unconscious mind\nsaying, “Who are you to cut me oﬀ?” You’re reacting to a threat to\nyour inherent sense of hierarchy. On the road we are all equals.\nWe’re all supposed to play by the same rules. Cutting someone oﬀ\nviolates those rules and implies higher status.[*] Or consider when\nyou get frustrated with your kids and end an argument with\n“Because I said so.” (Or the oﬃce equivalent: “Because I’m the\nboss.”) In these moments you’ve stopped thinking and regressed to\nyour biological tendencies of reaﬃrming the hierarchy.\nWe’re self-preserving. Most of us would never intentionally\npush someone else down to get where we want to go.[*] The key\nword here is “intentionally,” because intention involves thought.\nWhen we’re triggered and not thinking, our desire to protect\nourselves ﬁrst takes over. When layoﬀs loom at a company,\notherwise decent people will quickly throw each other under the\nbus to keep a job. Sure, they wouldn’t consciously want to hurt\ntheir colleagues, but if it comes down to “them versus me,” they\nwill ensure they come out on top. That’s biology.\nOur biological instincts provide an automatic response without\nconscious processing. After all, that’s what they’re for!\nConscious processing takes both time and energy. Evolution\nfavored stimulus-response shortcuts because they’re advantageous\nfor the group: they enhance group ﬁtness, group survival, and\nreproduction. As humans continued ﬂourishing in groups,\nhierarchies developed, creating order out of chaos and giving us all\na place. Territory is how we tried to avoid ﬁghting others—you stay\nout of my territory, I’ll stay out of yours. And self-preservation\nmeans we choose survival over rules, norms, or customs.\nThe problem occurs when you zoom in from the aggregate to the\nindividual, from the eons of evolution to the present moment of\ndecision. In today’s world, basic survival is no longer in question.\nThe very tendencies that once served us now often act as an anchor"

They\nhave many names, but for the purposes of this book, let’s call them\nthe emotion default, the ego default, the social default, and the inertia\ndefault.\nHere’s how each essentially functions:\n1. The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than\nreasons and facts.\n2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens\nour sense of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy.\n3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our\nlarger social group.\n4. The inertia default: we’re habit forming and comfort seeking.\nWe tend to resist change, and to prefer ideas, processes, and\nenvironments that are familiar.\nThere are no hard edges between defaults; they often bleed into one\nanother. Each on their own is enough to cause unforced errors, but\nwhen they act together, things quickly go from bad to worse.\nPeople who master their defaults get the best real-world results.\nIt’s not that they don’t have a temper or an ego, they just know how\nto control both rather than be controlled by them. With the ability\nto think clearly in ordinary moments today, they consistently put\nthemselves in a good position for tomorrow.\nIn the following section I’ll give an overview of how these\ndefaults manifest in human behavior, and how to recognize when\nthey’re at play in your own life. Not only will your own past actions\n\f\nmake more sense after taking defaults into account, but you’ll also\nlearn to identify when others are reacting to them too."

With\nhis defaults under control, he never reacts without reasoning, and\nwhen he does react, it’s ruthlessly eﬀective.\nVito’s oldest son, Santino, a.k.a. Sonny, is Vito’s heir apparent.\nUnlike his father, however, Sonny is vengeful, impulsive, and\nhotheaded. He easily ﬂies into ﬁts of rage, reacting ﬁrst and\nreasoning later. His unforced errors ensure he’s constantly playing\nlife on hard mode.\nThe emotion default controls Sonny, and he doesn’t realize it. On\none occasion, he beats his brother-in-law, Carlo Rizzi, in public, an\nact that will have unintended future consequences. On another\noccasion, a rival family approaches Vito about partnering to sell\ndrugs. Vito declines. But Sonny, quick to react without thinking,\njumps in and undermines his father’s position. After the meeting,\nVito oﬀers his son a lesson: “Never tell anyone outside the family\nwhat you’re thinking again.” But the lesson comes too late; the\ndamage is already done. The dealer decides that if Vito can be taken\nout, Sonny will take the deal. Sonny’s indiscretion leads to an\nassassination attempt on Vito’s life, which critically wounds his\nfather.\nWhile Vito is in the hospital, Sonny becomes acting head of the\nfamily. True to his impulsive nature, he initiates an all-out war with\nthe other families. Meanwhile, Carlo Rizzi continues to resent\nSonny for beating him in front of his crew, and conspires with a\nrival family to kill him. Carlo baits Sonny into reacting without\n\f\nreasoning, which leads to Sonny’s brutal assassination on the Jones\nBeach Causeway.\nSonny’s quick temper ultimately leads to his downfall, as it does\nfor many people. When we respond without reasoning, we’re more\nlikely to make mistakes that seem obvious in hindsight. In fact,\nwhen we respond emotionally, we often don’t even realize that\nwe’re in a position that calls for thinking at all. When you are\npossessed by the moment, all the reasoning tools in the world won’t\nhelp you.\nFrom Emotion to Action\nThere’s a bit of Sonny in each of us. You experience anger, fear, or\nsome other emotion, and feel compelled to act immediately. But in\nthese moments, the action you’re pushed toward rarely serves you.\nAnger at a rival prevents you from doing what’s in your own best\ninterest. Fear of losing an opportunity pushes you to cut thinking\nshort and act impulsively. Outrage at a criticism causes you to lash\nout in defense, alienating potential allies. The list goes on.\nEmotions can multiply all of your progress by zero. It doesn’t\nmatter how much you’ve thought about or worked at something, it\ncan all be undone in an instant. No one is immune. The Olympian\nMatthew Emmons, for instance, was a prodigy who’d come to\ndominate the ﬁeld of competitive riﬂe shooting. He was poised to\nwin his second Olympic gold when the emotion default worked its\nmischief. Emmons was in the ﬁnal round. He aimed. He ﬁred.\nBullseye. The only problem: he shot at the wrong target! Had it\nbeen the right one, he would’ve won the gold. Instead, he was\nawarded zero points and slipped to eighth place.\nAfterward, Emmons said that he usually looked through the riﬂe\nscope at the number above the target to make sure it was the\ncorrect one before lowering the riﬂe to the bullseye. In this case,\nhe’d skipped that crucial ﬁrst step.\n“On that shot,” he said, “I was just worrying about calming\nmyself down . . . so I didn’t even look at the number.”[1] So he\nscored a point for the emotion default, instead.\nWhile Emmons’s Olympic loss is epic, it pales in comparison to"

I noticed that Steve always seemed to shut\ndown whenever politics came up during work dinners. One day,\naway from the group, I asked him why.\nHe told me a story I’d never forget.\nOne night, Steve’s parents came over for dinner. When they\nstarted talking about politics and taxes, the conversation grew\nheated. Steve’s emotions soon took over, and he started saying\nthings he probably didn’t mean. Things that couldn’t be unsaid.\nThings we might say when we’re reacting and not thinking.\nThat was the last conversation he ever had with his parents.

They often have help, though. Later we’ll\nsee some of the many inbuilt biological vulnerabilities that leave us\neven more exposed to the emotion default’s inﬂuence: sleep\ndeprivation, hunger, fatigue, emotion, distraction, stress from\nfeeling rushed, and being in an unfamiliar environment. If you ﬁnd\nyourself in any of these conditions, be on your guard! The emotion\ndefault is likely running the show. We’ll also explore the safeguards\nthat can protect you in such situations.\n\f\nCHAPTER 1.3\nThe Ego Default\nGoing back to The Godfather, Carlo Rizzi is an example of a diﬀerent\ndefault at work: the ego.\nCarlo becomes a member of the Corleone family when he\nmarries Vito’s daughter, Connie. As an outsider, he occupies a\nrelatively low position in the social hierarchy. Full of pride and ego,\nhe becomes increasingly frustrated by his marginal role in the\nfamily business. This frustration leads him to take some\nunforgivable actions.\nThat’s just what happens in life sometimes; the ego default\nprompts us to promote and protect our self-image at all costs.\nIn Carlo’s case, being reminded of his low status in the family\ncombines with his desire to defend his self-image (“I can do more\nthan the job I’m in, but they won’t give me more”) and leads him to\nmake the ultimate betrayal. Carlo never intended to tear the\nCorleone family apart from within. He just wanted a role in line\nwith how he saw himself. The daily indignation of being treated as\nlesser set oﬀ a chain reaction he never intended.\nAppearing Successful vs. Being Successful\nNot all conﬁdence is created equally. Sometimes, it comes from a\ntrack record of applying deep knowledge successfully, and other\ntimes it comes from the shallowness of reading an article. It’s\namazing how often the ego turns unearned knowledge into reckless\nconﬁdence.\nA little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, as one of my kids\nlearned the hard way. Not wanting to write out his homework in\n\f\nFrench, which would take a lot of time and eﬀort, he realized he\ncould write it out in English and put it through an online translator.\nWhen I asked him how he ﬁnished so quickly, he told me it was\neasy and left it at that. Of course, his French teacher realized what\nhe had done and gave him a zero.\nOur ego tempts us into thinking we’re more than we are. Left\nunchecked, it can turn conﬁdence into overconﬁdence or even\narrogance. We get a bit of knowledge on the internet and suddenly\nwe are full of hubris. Everything seems easy. As a result, we take\nrisks that we may not understand we’re taking. We must resist this\nkind of unearned conﬁdence, though, if we are to get the results we\ndesire.\nRecently, after a talk I attended on the growing homeless\npopulation, the person sitting next to me commented on how easy it\nwould be to solve this deep and complex issue. He was intoxicated\nwith a little unearned conﬁdence, based on shallow understanding,\nso the problem seemed simple to him. However, those with\ncompetence based on hard-earned knowledge didn’t think the\nproblem was simple at all. They were fully aware of the realities of\nthe situation.\nUnearned knowledge rushes us to judgment. “I’ve got this,” we\nthink. We convince ourselves that low-chance events are zero-\nchance events and think only of best-case outcomes. We feel\nimmune to bad luck—to the bad things that happen to other people,\nbecause of our newfound (and false) sense of conﬁdence.[1]\nConﬁdence doesn’t make bad outcomes any less likely or good\noutcomes more likely, it only blinds us to risk. The ego also makes\nus more concerned with maintaining or improving our perceived\nposition in a social hierarchy than with extending our knowledge or\nskills.\nOne reason people ﬁnd it hard to empower others at work is that\nhaving them depend on us for every decision makes us feel\nimportant and indispensable. Having them depend on us makes us\nfeel not only necessary but powerful. The more people who depend\non us the more powerful we feel. However, this position is often\nself-defeating. Slowly and then all at once we become a prisoner of\nthe circumstances we created; more and more eﬀort is needed to\n\f\nstay in the same place, and we approach the ceiling of brute force.\n[*] It’s only a matter of time until things break.\nThe person who wants to be seen as great shows the world how\nto manipulate them. We’re prone to being less concerned with\nactual greatness than with exuding the appearance of greatness.\nWhen someone steps on how we see ourselves (or how we want to\nbe seen), the ego leaps into action, and we often react without\nreasoning. Carlo Rizzi is a ﬁctional example, but there are many\nreal ones.\nIn September 1780, for instance, the American general Benedict\nArnold secretly met a British spy. In exchange for £20,000 and a\nBritish military command, Arnold agreed to give the British control\nof the fort at West Point, which was then under his command.\nWhat powerful force could make someone betray his country?\nArnold’s reason was the same as Carlo Rizzi’s: long-harbored\nresentment about his social standing.\nArnold had been an accomplished military oﬃcer, but he wasn’t\ngenerally well-liked. He had a jealous disposition and frequently\ncomplained about Congress promoting younger, less competent\noﬃcers ahead of him. He was quick to react to social slights, both\nreal and imagined. And his tendency to prove his superiority by\nhumiliating people with whom he disagreed created an invisible\narmy of enemies.\nHe nevertheless managed to earn the conﬁdence of the\nContinental Army’s commander in chief, George Washington, who\nappointed Arnold military governor of Philadelphia. Around this\ntime, Arnold sought the hand of Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a\nwealthy Philadelphia family.\nThe Shippens were loyalist sympathizers interested in making\nconnections only with similarly wealthy people. Arnold, however,\nwas not wealthy. His alcoholic father had squandered the family\nfortune when Arnold was a boy. Arnold had been trying to\nreestablish the family’s position in society ever since.\nArnold lived extravagantly, throwing lavish parties, with the\nhope of earning the respect of Philadelphia’s wealthy elite. He\npromised the Shippens that he would bestow on Peggy a large sum\nin advance of their wedding as proof of his ﬁnancial means, and\n\f\ntook out a large mortgage to purchase a mansion. When Arnold and\nPeggy were ﬁnally married, Arnold was deeply in debt. He and\nPeggy couldn’t even occupy that mansion because he needed to rent\nit out to pay the mortgage.\nArnold’s lifestyle caught the attention of his many enemies,\nincluding Pennsylvania’s unscrupulous president of the Supreme\nExecutive Council, Joseph Reed. Reed built a ﬂimsy case against\nArnold which, it seemed, was more intended to disgrace the man\npublicly than anything else. It turned out, however, that Arnold had\nbeen using his position as military governor to beneﬁt himself\nﬁnancially. Eventually, his case was brought before a court martial.\nGeneral Washington gave Arnold only a light reprimand, yet Arnold\nfelt that Washington had betrayed him.\nA short while later, he would go on to betray his country.\nArnold’s pride had been wounded. He wanted to show others his\nvalue and importance. He wanted others to see him the way he saw\nhimself. When they didn’t, he stopped exercising judgment, and\nended up going down in history for all the wrong reasons.\nWho hasn’t found themselves in a similar situation? Someone\nclose to you doesn’t appreciate you the way you want to be\nappreciated. Perhaps they don’t see how insightful you are. Or\nmaybe they don’t see how much you do for them. Desperate to\nsatisfy the ego, either personally or professionally, you stop\nthinking and do things you otherwise wouldn’t, like approach a\ncompetitor or ﬂirt with someone at a party. One example I’ve seen\ntoo many times in the workplace is when you stop putting in 100\npercent of what you are capable of because you feel\nunderappreciated.[*] The ego grabs your unconscious, throws your\nlong-term goals out the window, and sets you sailing on a path\ntoward destruction.\nIf Arnold hadn’t been so consumed by ego—had he instead\nreacted less and reasoned more—he might have seen that his long-\nterm political objectives and his family’s well-being demanded a\nmore modest way of life.\nFeeling Right over Being Right\n\f\nOur desire to feel right overpowers our desire to be right.\nThe ego default urges us to feel right at the expense of being\nright. Few things feel better than being right—so much so that we\nwill unconsciously rearrange the world into arbitrary hierarchies to\nmaintain our beliefs and feel better about ourselves. My ﬁrst\nmemory of doing so dates back to my days of working in a grocery\nstore at age sixteen.\nOne particular customer would always treat the staﬀ poorly.\nHe’d drive up in his fancy car, park it illegally outside, and run in to\nget something. When there was a line, he’d rudely comment and\nraise his voice telling everyone to hurry up. We called him Mr.\nRolex.\nOne day when he was waiting in my line, he told me to “hurry\nthe f**k up because this Rolex doesn’t pay for itself.”\nI’ll leave my reply out but let’s just say that it cost me a job.\nIt was worth it, though, because the experience made me realize\nthat some people organize their unconscious hierarchy by money\nand status. Those were the ways Mr. Rolex had of keeping the score\nto always come out on top.\nI remember walking home that night thinking that while I might\nnot have a job, at least I wasn’t like him. And at that moment I\nrearranged the world in such a way that I, the newly unemployed\nhigh school student without a car or a lavish wristwatch, came out\non top. I had unconsciously organized the world in a way where I\ncould be above him and feel better about myself.\nBoth of us reverted to the ego default that day.\nMost people go through life assuming that they’re right . . . and\nthat people who don’t see things their way are wrong.[2] We\nmistake how we want the world to be with how it actually is. The\nsubject doesn’t matter: we’re right about politics, other people, our\nmemories; you name it. We mistake how we want the world to\nwork for how it does work.\nOf course, we can’t be right about everything all the time.\nEveryone makes mistakes or misremembers some things. But we\nstill want to feel right all the time, and ideally get other people to\nreinforce that feeling. Hence, we channel inordinate amounts of\nenergy to proving to others—or ourselves—that we’re right. When\n\f\nthis happens, we’re less concerned with outcomes and more\nconcerned with protecting our egos.\nLater I’ll discuss more about how to combat the ego default. For\nthe time being, keep in mind how to recognize it when it rears its\nhead. If you ﬁnd yourself expending tremendous energy on how\nyou are seen, if you often feel your pride being wounded, if you\nﬁnd yourself reading an article or two on a subject and thinking\nyou’re an expert, if you always try to prove you’re right and have\ndiﬃculty admitting mistakes, if you have a hard time saying “I\ndon’t know,” or if you’re frequently envious of others or feel as\nthough you’re never given the recognition you deserve—be on\nguard! Your ego is in charge."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 1.4\nThe Social Default\nWhere all think alike, no one thinks very much.\n—WALTER LIPPMANN, The Stakes of Diplomacy\nYears ago, I witnessed a particularly ugly and grim talk at a\nconference. When it ended, others started clapping. I hesitated but\ntentatively joined them anyway. It would have felt awkward not to.\n[*] The social default inspires conformity. It coaxes us to fall in line\nwith an idea or behavior simply because other people do. It\nembodies what the term “social pressure” refers to: wanting to\nbelong to the crowd, fear of being an outsider, fear of being\nscorned, fear of disappointing other people.\nOur desire to ﬁt in with the group comes from our history.\nGroup interests were well served from a high level of conformity.\nBut so too were our individual interests. Survival inside the tribe\nwas hard but survival outside the tribe was impossible. Because we\nneeded the group, our individual interests became secondary to the\ngroup interests. Though the world we live in today is very diﬀerent\nfrom the one we evolved from, we still look to others for cues on\nhow to behave.\nThe social rewards for going with the crowd are felt long before\nthe beneﬁts of going against it are gained. One measure of a person\nis the degree to which they’ll do the right thing when it goes against\nthe popular belief. However, it is easy to overestimate our\nwillingness to diverge from the crowd, and underestimate our\nbiological instinct to ﬁt in.\nThe social default encourages us to outsource our thoughts,\nbeliefs, and outcomes to others. When everyone else is doing\n\f\nsomething, it’s easy to rationalize doing it too. No need to stand\nout, take responsibility for outcomes, or think for yourself. Just put\nyour brain on autopilot and take a nap.\nThe social default inspires virtue signaling—getting other people\nto accept or praise your professed beliefs. Especially when there is\nno cost to such signals.\nPrinceton professor Robert George wrote, “I sometimes ask\nstudents what their position on slavery would have been had they\nbeen white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what?\nThey all would have been abolitionists! They all would have\nbravely spoken out against slavery, and worked tirelessly against\nit.”[1]\nNo, they wouldn’t have. They may understandably want to send\nthat signal now when it’s safe to do so, but back then they would\nhave likely behaved the same most everyone else did at the time.[2]\nLemmings Rarely Make History\nThe social default makes us fear being snubbed, ridiculed, and\ntreated like an idiot. In most people’s minds, this fear of losing\nsocial capital outweighs any potential upsides of deviating from the\nsocial norm and disposes them to accept it.[3]\nFear holds us back from taking risks and reaching our potential.\nNo one grows up saying I want to do the same thing everyone\nelse is doing. And yet there is a comfort to surrounding yourself\nwith people who agree with you, or who are doing the same thing\nyou’re doing. So while there is sometimes embedded wisdom in the\ncrowd, mistaking the comfort of the collective for evidence that\nwhat you’re doing is going to lead to better results is the social\ndefault’s big lie.\nThe only way to outperform if you’re doing undiﬀerentiated\nwork is to work harder than everyone else. Imagine a team of\nditchdiggers working with their hands. A slight variation in the\namount of soil moved per hour is barely perceptible. Your work is\nindistinguishable from that of the person next to you. The only way\nto move more dirt is to dig for longer. Within this paradigm, the\nditchdigger who takes a week oﬀ to experiment and invent the\n\f\nshovel seems crazy. Not only do they look like a fool for taking a\nrisk, but their cumulative production falls behind for every day they\nare not digging. Only when the shovel comes along do others see its\nadvantage. Success requires shamelessness. So too does failure.\nDoing something diﬀerent means you might underperform, but it\nalso means you might change the game entirely.\nIf you do what everyone else does, you’ll get the same results\nthat everyone else gets.[*] Best practices aren’t always the best. By\ndeﬁnition, they’re average.\nIf you don’t know enough about what you’re doing to make your\nown decisions, you probably should do what everyone is doing. If\nyou want better-than-average results, though, you’ll have to think\nclearly. And thinking clearly is thinking independently. Sometimes\nyou have to break free of the social default and do something\ndiﬀerently from those around you. Fair warning: it’s going to get\nuncomfortable.\nOur desire to ﬁt in often overpowers our desire for a better\noutcome. Instead of trying something new, we tell ourselves\nsomething new.\nDeviating from established practices can be painful. Who wants\nto try something diﬀerent that might not work? We could end up\nlosing people’s respect, their friendship, and even our job if we\ndeviate too far from the status quo without producing the right\nresults. This is why we rarely try new approaches, and when we do,\nwe often proceed with so much trepidation that the smallest setback\nsends us back to the safety blanket of conformity.\nIt’s easy to take comfort in the fact that other people agree with\nus. As legendary investor Warren Buﬀett pointed out, though, “The\nfact that other people agree or disagree with you makes you neither\nright nor wrong. You will be right if your facts and reasoning are\ncorrect.”\nThe people executing established practices say they want new\nideas, but they just don’t want the bad ones. And because they so\nwant to avoid the bad ones, they never deviate enough to ﬁnd new\ngood ones.\nWhile we need divergence from the norm to make progress, not\nall divergence is advantageous. To be successful, it’s not enough to\n\f\ndo something diﬀerent; you also need to be right. To do something\ndiﬀerent, you need to think diﬀerent. And that means you will\nstand out.[*]\nLou Brock might have put it best when he said, “Show me a guy\nwho’s afraid to look bad, and I’ll show you a guy you can beat every\ntime.” In other words, someone who’s possessed by the social\ndefault is easy to defeat.\nWarren Buﬀett similarly highlighted the eﬀects of the social\ndefault in his 1984 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders:\nMost managers have very little incentive to make the\nintelligent-but-with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot\ndecision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if\nan unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on\nthe back and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip.\n(Failing conventionally is the route to go; as a group,\nlemmings may have a rotten image, but no individual\nlemming has ever received bad press.)[4]\nLemmings might make small changes, sure, but not the changes\nthey need in order to make an outsize impact. While they’ll talk\nabout how they’re doing great things to change the course of\nevents, when you dig beneath the surface, things are the same as\nbefore. What’s really changed is the marketing.\nChange happens only when you’re willing to think\nindependently, when you do what nobody else is doing, and risk\nlooking like a fool because of it. Once you realize you’ve been doing\nwhat everyone else is doing—and only because they’re already\ndoing it—it’s time to try something new.\nLater I’ll discuss more examples of how the social default\noperates and how to combat it. For the time being keep the\nfollowing in mind: if you ﬁnd yourself exerting energy to ﬁt in with\na crowd, if you’re frequently fearful of disappointing other people,\nif you’re afraid of being an outsider, or if the threat of scorn ﬁlls\nyou with dread, then beware! The social default is in charge."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 1.5\nThe Inertia Default\nThe great enemy of any attempt to change men’s habits is inertia.\nCivilization is limited by inertia.\n— EDWARD L. BERNAYS, Propaganda\nIn the mid-2000s, I invested a signiﬁcant portion of my net worth\ninto a small restaurant chain. A large investor had bought a\ncontrolling stake in the company and managed to turn around the\noperations, but those changes weren’t yet reﬂected in the\ncompany’s stock price. The CEO said and did all the right things. It\nwas a compelling opportunity, so I went all in.\nOver the subsequent years, however, the CEO’s attitude changed.\nWhat began as a fair partnership turned into a dictatorship. Like a\npot of water coming to boil, the change was slow and hard to notice\nuntil, all of a sudden, it was boiling over.\nI’d made multiples on the investment and believed in its future,\nso I was hesitant to exit the position too quickly—but eventually the\nfacts became overwhelming, and I had to sell. After a bit of success,\nthe ego default had taken control of the CEO. Suddenly all partners\nweren’t exactly equal, one was better than the rest.[*]\nChanging my mind took a while. Each transgression by the CEO\nwas minor and easy to explain away. It was only after I’d stepped\naway from the situation and began viewing it with some\nperspective that I realized how far the behavior had gone. I was\nlucky to get out before it became apparent to everyone else—I came\nawfully close to losing a whole lot of money.[*]\nThe inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting\nsomething is hard but so too is stopping something.[1] We resist\n\f\nchange even when change is for the best.\nThe Latin word inertia means literally “inertness”: that is,\nlaziness or idleness. In physics, “inertia” refers to an object resisting\na change in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating\nNewton’s ﬁrst law of motion—the law of inertia—is this: “A body in\nmotion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at\nrest.”\nObjects never change if they’re left alone. They don’t start\nmoving on their own, nor do they stop moving till something stops\nthem.[*] This law of physics can also be applied to human behavior\nand our instinct to resist even beneﬁcial change. The physicist\nLeonard Mlodinow sums it up this way: “Once our minds are set in\na direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted\nupon by some outside force.”[2] This cognitive inertia is why\nchanging our minds is hard.\nInertia keeps us in jobs we hate and in relationships that don’t\nmake us happy, because in both cases we know what to expect and\nit’s comforting to have our expectations reliably met.\nOne reason we resist change is that keeping things the way they\nare requires almost no eﬀort. This helps explain why we get\ncomplacent. It takes a lot of eﬀort to build momentum but far less\nto maintain it. Once something becomes “good enough,” we can\nstop the eﬀort and still get decent results. The inertia default\nleverages our desire to stay in our comfort zone, relying on old\ntechniques or standards even when they’re no longer optimal.\nAnother reason we tend to push back against change is that\ndoing something diﬀerent might lead to worse results. There is an\nasymmetry to change—we take negative results to heart more than\npositive ones. Worse results make us stand out for the wrong\nreasons. Why risk looking like an idiot when you can remain\naverage? We’d rather be average than risk the possibility of landing\nsomewhere below average.\nInertia is evident in many of our daily habits, such as when we\nstick to the same grocery store brand even if a new, superior one\nappears on the market. This reluctance to try new products is often\ndue to the uncertainty and eﬀort involved in evaluating them. To\ncombat this, companies often oﬀer free samples to customers, which\n\f\nserves as a low-risk way for them to try a new product and evaluate\nits quality without the fear of disappointment.\nWe like to think we’re open-minded and willing to change our\nbeliefs when the facts change, but history has shown otherwise.\nWhen the automobile was ﬁrst introduced, many critics dismissed it\nas a mere fad, arguing that horses and carriages were a more\nreliable mode of transportation. Similarly, when the airplane was\nﬁrst invented, people were skeptical of its practicality and safety.\nThe radio, television, and internet all faced similar initial\nskepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a\nprofound impact on the way we live today.\nThe “zone of average” is a dangerous place when it comes to\ninertia. It’s the point where things are working well enough that we\ndon’t feel the need to make any changes. We hope things will\nmagically improve. Of course, they rarely do. For example, staying\nin a relationship that is too good to leave and too bad to stay is a\nperfect example of the zone of average. If things were much worse,\nwe would act, but since they’re not terrible, we stay, and hope\nthings get better.\nDoubling Down When You’re Wrong\nAs the famous quote often falsely attributed to Charles Darwin goes,\n“It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most\nintelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to\nchange.”[3] Even though it’s a misquotation, it’s not useless just\nbecause it’s not Darwin.\nWhen circumstances change, we need to adapt. But inertia closes\nminds and stiﬂes the motivation to change how we’ve been doing\nthings. It makes it harder to imagine alternative methods, and\ndiscourages experimentation and course correction.\nFor instance, public statements can create inertia. Putting\nsomething on the record establishes expectations along with social\npressure to meet those expectations. When new information\nchallenges one of our statements, we might instinctively dismiss it\nand emphasize the old information that supported it. We want to be\nconsistent with what we said. Changing our minds becomes\n\f\nincreasingly diﬃcult. We witness how, say, people label a politician\na “ﬂip-ﬂopper” instead of “intelligent” when they change their\nposition in response to the facts, and our fear of the social\nimplications of changing our minds continues to grow.\nInertia also prevents us from doing hard things. The longer we\navoid the hard thing we know we should do, the harder it becomes\nto do. Avoiding conﬂict is comfortable and easy. The longer we\navoid the conﬂict, however, the more necessary it becomes to\ncontinue avoiding it. What starts out as avoiding a small but\ndiﬃcult conversation quickly grows into avoiding a large and\nseemingly impossible one. The weight of what we avoid eventually\naﬀects our relationship.\nGroups create inertia of their own. They tend to value\nconsistency over eﬀectiveness, and reward people for maintaining\nthe status quo. Inertia makes deviating from group norms diﬃcult.\nThe threat of standing out in a negative way too often keeps people\nin line. As a result, group dynamics end up favoring people who\ndon’t deviate from the defaults.\nGroup inertia is partly responsible for why a friend of mine, and\nI suspect a host of others, got married in the ﬁrst place. According\nto him, in hindsight, “All the signs were there that it might not\nwork out, but it seemed like a lot to start over with someone new,\nand everyone around us was getting engaged, so that’s what we\ndid.”\nThe inﬂuence of inertia isn’t just troubling in our work and\nrelationships, it can also be bad for our health. In 1910, America’s\nleading expert on industrial toxicology, Alice Hamilton, was\nappointed to head a survey on industrial illness in the state of\nIllinois. Over the next few years, she provided deﬁnitive evidence of\nthe dangers of lead exposure in the workplace and of lead-tainted\nexhaust fumes from automobiles. But despite the evidence, General\nMotors and other car manufacturers continued producing lead-\nfueled vehicles. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the US ﬁnally banned\nleaded fuel. Even today, lead continues to be used for other\napplications, despite the availability of nontoxic options at a similar\nprice.[4]\nInertia keeps us doing things that don’t get us what we want. It\n\f\noperates in our subconscious largely undetected until its eﬀects are\ntoo hard to counter. Later I’ll discuss more examples of the inertia\ndefault at work and how to combat it. For the time being keep the\nfollowing in mind: if you ﬁnd yourself biting your tongue in group\nsituations, if you ﬁnd yourself or your team resisting change or\ncontinuing to do something in one way simply because that’s how\nyou’ve always done it in the past—be on your guard! The inertia\ndefault is likely at work."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 1.6\nDefault to Clarity\nA man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills.\n—ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER\nWhile we can’t eliminate our defaults, we can reprogram them. If\nwe want to improve our behavior, accomplish more of our goals,\nand experience greater joy and meaning in our lives, we need to\nlearn to manage our defaults.\nThe good news is that the same biological tendencies that make\nus react without reasoning can be reprogrammed into forces for\ngood.\nThink of your default patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting as\nalgorithms you’ve been programmed to run unconsciously in\nresponse to inputs from other people or the environment. We don’t\nthink about moving our knee when the doctor hits it with a reﬂex\nhammer. It just moves. The same thing happens with your thoughts\nand actions. We receive some type of input from the world and then\nexecute an algorithm that processes that input and automatically\nproduces an output.\nMany of the algorithms you’re running have been programmed\ninto you by evolution, culture, ritual, your parents, and your\ncommunity. Some of these algorithms help move you closer to what\nyou want; others move you further away.\nYou unconsciously adopt the habits of the people you spend time\nwith, and those people make it easier or harder for you to achieve\nprogress toward what you want to achieve. The more time you\nspend with people, the more likely you start to think and act as they\ndo.\n\f\nEventually, almost everyone loses the battle with willpower; it’s\nonly a matter of time. Consider my parents. Neither of them smoked\nwhen they joined the armed forces, but it didn’t take long for them\nto follow the lead of their smoking coworkers. At ﬁrst, they resisted,\nbut as the days turned into weeks, the grind of constantly saying no\nwore them down. Decades later, quitting proved nearly impossible\nbecause everyone around them smoked. The very same force that\nencouraged them to start was now preventing them from stopping.\nThey were only able to kick their habit when they changed their\nenvironment. They had to ﬁnd new friends whose default behavior\nwas their desired behavior.\nThat’s just how it goes sometimes when we’re forming or\nbreaking habits. What may look like discipline often involves a\ncarefully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. And\nwhat may look like poor choices is often just someone trying their\nbest to use willpower and bumping up against their defaults. The\npeople with the best defaults are typically the ones with the best\nenvironment. Sometimes it’s part of a deliberate strategy, and\nsometimes it’s just plain luck. Either way, it’s easier to align\nyourself with the right behavior when everyone else is already\ndoing it.\nThe way to improve your defaults isn’t by willpower but by\ncreating an intentional environment where your desired behavior\nbecomes the default behavior.\nJoining groups whose default behaviors are your desired\nbehavior is an eﬀective way to create an intentional environment. If\nyou want to read more, join a book club. If you want to run more,\njoin a running club. If you want to exercise more, hire a trainer.\nYour chosen environment, rather than your willpower alone, will\nhelp nudge you toward the best choices.\nIt’s easier said than done, though. Reprogramming a computer is\nsimply a matter of rewriting lines of code, while reprogramming\nyourself is a longer and more involved process. It’s this process that\nI describe in the chapters that follow.\n\f\nPART 2\nBUILDING STRENGTH\nCriticizing others is easier than coming to know\nyourself.\n—BRUCE LEE\nCOUNTERACTING THE ENEMIES of clear thinking requires more than\nwillpower.\nOur defaults work oﬀ deeply ingrained biological tendencies—our\ntendencies for self-preservation, for recognizing and maintaining\nsocial hierarchies, and for defending ourselves and our territory. We\ncan’t simply know these tendencies exist and then will them out of\nexistence. On the contrary, the feeling that willpower is all it takes to\nremove these forces is one of the tricks they use to keep us under\ntheir control.\nTo stop our defaults from impeding good judgment, we need to\nharness equally powerful biological forces. We need to take the\nsame forces that the defaults would use to ruin us and turn them to\nour advantage. Chief among them is the force of inertia.\nInertia is a double-edged sword. We saw earlier that inertia is a\ntendency to maintain the status quo. If the status quo is sub-optimal\nor dysfunctional, inertia works against us. But the status quo doesn’t\nhave to be sub-optimal. If you train yourself to consistently think,\nfeel, and act in ways that further your most important goals—if, in\nother words, you build strength—then inertia becomes a nearly\nunstoppable force that unlocks your potential.\nEstablishing rituals is the key to creating positive inertia. Rituals\nfocus the mind on something other than the moment. They can be\nas simple as taking a quick pause before responding to someone’s\npoint of contention at work. One of my old mentors used to tell me,\n\f\n“When someone slights you in a meeting, take a deep breath before\nyou speak and watch how often you change what you’re about to\nsay.”\nRituals are hidden in plain sight anywhere temperament matters\nfor performance. The next time you watch a basketball game or\ntennis match, notice how the players always bounce the ball the\nsame number of times before shooting a free throw or serving. It\ndoesn’t matter if the previous play was the best or worst of your\ncareer. Rituals force the mind to focus on the next play, not the last\none.\nStrength is the power to press pause on your defaults and\nexercise good judgment. It doesn’t matter what’s going on in the\nworld, or how unfair things may seem. It doesn’t matter that you feel\nembarrassed, threatened, or angry. The person who can take a step\nback for a second, center themselves, and get out of the moment\nwill outperform the person who can’t.\nWhen Rudyard Kipling wrote his classic poem “If—”the one that\ngoes, “If you can keep your head when all about you / Are losing\ntheirs and blaming it on you, / If you can trust yourself when all . . .\ndoubt you”—he made a convincing case for personal strength.[*]\nBuilding strength is about domesticating the wild horses of our\nnature—training and harnessing them to improve our lives. It’s about\nturning the headwinds of our biology into tailwinds that carry us\nreliably toward our most cherished goals.\nHere are four key strengths you’ll need:\nSelf-accountability: holding yourself accountable for developing\nyour abilities, managing your inabilities, and using reason to govern\nyour actions\nSelf-knowledge: knowing your own strengths and weaknesses—\nwhat you’re capable of doing and what you’re not\nSelf-control: mastering your fears, desires, and emotions\nSelf-conﬁdence: trusting in your abilities and your value to others\nI’ll deﬁne each of these strengths and discuss how they counteract\nyour defaults, before explaining how you can begin to build them\nand take command of your life.\n\f\n⦁"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 2.1\nSelf-Accountability\nI am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\n—W. E. HENLEY, “INVICTUS”\nSelf-accountability means taking responsibility for your abilities,\nyour inabilities, and your actions. If you can’t do that, you might\nnever move forward.\nYou might not have someone in your life who holds you\naccountable, but that doesn’t matter. You can hold yourself\naccountable. Others might not expect more from you, but you can\nexpect more from yourself. No one else need reward or punish you\ninto it.\nExternal rewards are nice, but they’re optional; you don’t need\nthem to do your best. Your honest judgments about yourself are\nmore important than anyone else’s. And when you screw up, you\nshould be strong enough to look in the mirror and say, “This was\nmy fault. I need to do better.” While you may never have asked for\nit, you’re in charge of your own life—and a larger part of your\noutcomes than you may think.\nPeople who lack self-accountability tend to run on autopilot.\nThis is the exact opposite of commanding your own life. These\npeople constantly succumb to external pressure: seeking rewards,\navoiding punishments, and measuring themselves against other\npeople’s scoreboards. They’re followers, not leaders. They don’t take\nresponsibility for their mistakes. Instead, they always try to blame\nother people, circumstances, or bad luck—nothing’s ever their fault.\nWell, I have news for you.

    "raw_text": "better your position tomorrow. You might not be able to solve the\nproblem, but your next action will make the situation better or\nworse. There is always an action you can control, however tiny,\nthat helps you achieve progress.\nExcuses, Excuses\nComplaining is not a strategy. You have to work with the world as you ﬁnd it,\nnot as you would have it be.\n—JEFF BEZOS[1]\nOne Sunday morning early in my career, I arrived at work to ﬁnd a\ncolleague of mine already there. We were working on a critical\npiece of software for an upcoming covert operation. He approached\nme shortly after I sat down at my desk.\n“That code you were writing was supposed to be done two days\nago,” he said. “The operation is tonight, and we can’t go without\nyou. We still have to test. You’ve put the whole thing in jeopardy.\nPeople are relying on us.”\nIn the post-9/11 world, we were all working nonstop and were\nunder a lot of pressure. No one was sleeping more than ﬁve or six\nhours a night. Our health was questionable as we injected ourselves\nwith coﬀee and Jolt cola once or twice an hour.\nWe were writing complex, mission-critical software at the lowest\nlevels of the operating system—diﬃcult stuﬀ even in the best of\ncircumstances. There was no manual for this stuﬀ, and you couldn’t\nsimply Google how to do it.\nWe were breaking new ground. The time pressure didn’t help.\nWe were doing all we could, yet it never seemed like enough. And\nafter years of sixty-hour workweeks and constant pressure, our\npersonal and professional relationships were strained and starting to\ncrack.\nMy response felt completely natural: “But . . . I had all of these\nmeetings and got pulled into this other project the director said was\ntop priority. And . . . I planned to work on it Friday morning, but\nthe bus got stuck in the snow, and it took two hours to get to\nwork.”\n\f\nI thought I kept my composure pretty well, but my inner\ndialogue was even more defensive. It went something like this:\n“Dude! Cut me some slack. It’s Sunday. I haven’t had a vacation in\nyears. I spend way more time with you than with my girlfriend. I’m\ndoing the best I can, and nothing I do ever seems to be enough.”\n“So, you’re telling me this wasn’t your fault?” he said innocently,\nsetting a trap I didn’t see.\n“Look, a lot of stuﬀ came up that I couldn’t control,” I said.\n“Don’t worry. I’ll get it done today.”\n“That’s bullshit! It is your fault. Stop making excuses.” He turned\nhis back and started walking away. “Do what needs to be done, or\nwe’ll have to call oﬀ the operation because of you,” he said without\na backward glance.\nI suddenly felt energized, and not with the positive energy of\nsurging toward a goal. The defaults took control. This was ego-\ndefending energy. I was defending my territory, defending my very\nsense of self.\nThere’s no greater source of renewable energy in the world than\nwhen you’re defending your own self-image. While my colleague\ndidn’t threaten me physically, he threatened how I saw myself as\nworking hard and getting things done. And when someone\nthreatens how you see yourself, you stop thinking and start\nreacting.\nI began writing up a list of all the things I’d done that week—\nhow many hours I’d worked, how many projects I’d worked on, how\nmany people and operations I’d helped. As I rehearsed these points,\nI got angrier and angrier. The inertia of my negative emotions\nturned into a powerful doom loop. I wasn’t conscious of the path I\nwas on. I was reacting, not reasoning. My power to make excuses\nfelt limitless: “Who is this guy to tell me it’s my fault?! He doesn’t\nsee what I see!”\nI emailed him the list. It ﬁlled over a page. His response arrived\na few moments later:\nI don’t care. It’s your responsibility to our team and our mission\nto get your shit done. If you can’t own that, learn from it, and\nﬁgure it out for next time. I don’t want to work with you.\n\f\nPS Don’t blame the bus for being late. Buy a car.\nWTF!?!! My response moved beyond mental and became physical.\nMy heart rate increased, and my eyes narrowed as I lost control of\nmy feelings and thoughts. That short email derailed me for a few\nhours.\nAll the energy we put into defending ourselves comes at the\nexpense of the very thing that would make the situation better:\nmoving on and doing what needs to be done. It’s a choice we don’t\nrealize we’re making. Had someone tapped me on the shoulder and\nsaid, “You’re about to spend three hours of energy on this, are you\nsure you want to do that?” I would have said no.\nWhile that email was neither nice nor fair, it was kind and it\nchanged my life. Sure, my colleague could’ve been gentler.[*] But\nthat didn’t mean he was wrong.\nToo often, the people we ask for feedback are kind but not nice.\nKind people will tell you things a nice person will not. A kind\nperson will tell you that you have spinach on your teeth. A nice\nperson won’t because it’s uncomfortable. A kind person will tell us\nwhat holds us back even when it’s uncomfortable. A nice person\navoids giving us critical feedback because they’re worried about\nhurting out feelings. No wonder we end up thinking other people\nwill be interested in our excuses.[*]\nMy team was unmoved by the fact that the bus was late and it\nwasn’t my fault. All that mattered was the success of the operation.\nAnd results are what it usually boils down to.\nNo one cares about your excuses as much as you do. In fact, no\none cares about your excuses at all, except you.\nNo One Cares. It’s Your Fault\nWhen people’s actions have outcomes that don’t line up with how\nthey see themselves, they tend to insulate their egos by blaming\nother people or unfavorable circumstances. Psychologists even have\na term for this tendency. They call it self-serving bias, a habit of\nevaluating things in ways that protect or enhance our self-image.\nStatements like “It was a great idea just poorly executed,” “We did"

    "raw_text": "the best we could,” and “We never should’ve been in this situation\nin the ﬁrst place” are often manifestations of this bias.[*]\nHere’s the thing: It might be true. Maybe it really wasn’t a bad\nidea, just bad execution. Maybe you really did do the best you\ncould. Maybe you never should have been in that situation in the\nﬁrst place. Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter. No one cares. None of it\nchanges the outcome or solves the problems that still remain.\nNot Your Fault? It’s Still Your Responsibility\nJust because something happened that was outside of your control\ndoesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility to deal with it the best you\ncan.\nOur desire to protect ourselves prevents us from moving forward.\nIt’s tempting to absolve yourself, throwing your hands up and\nclaiming you have no control over the situation you’ve landed in.\nAnd sure, sometimes that’s true. There are circumstances of chance\nthat have a negative impact. People suﬀer misfortune all the time\nfor reasons beyond their control: stray bullets, diseases, getting\nstruck by a drunk driver.\nComplaining does nothing to change the present situation you\nﬁnd yourself in, though. Thinking about how it wasn’t your fault\ndoesn’t make anything better. The consequences are still yours to\ndeal with.\nAlways focus on the next move, the one that gets you closer or\nfurther from where you want to go.\nIf you play poker, you learn this intuitively. You’re dealt a hand\nbased mostly on luck. Feeling sorry for yourself, complaining about\nthe hand you were dealt, or blaming others for how they played\ntheir hands only distracts you from what you can control. Your\nresponsibility is to play the hand as best you can.\nYou can put energy into things you control or things you don’t\ncontrol. All the energy you put toward things you don’t control\ncomes out of the energy you can put toward the things you can.\nWhile no one chooses diﬃcult circumstances, adversity provides\nopportunity. It allows us to test ourselves, and see who we’ve\nbecome. The test isn’t against other people, though; it’s against our\n\f\nformer selves. Are we better than we were yesterday? When\ncircumstances are easy, it’s hard to distinguish ordinary people from\nextraordinary ones, or to see the extraordinary within ourselves. As\nthe Roman slave Publilius Syrus once said, “Anyone can steer the\nship when the sea is calm.”[*]\nThe path to being exceptional begins when you decide to be\nresponsible for your actions no matter the situation. Exceptional\npeople know they can’t change the hand they’ve been dealt, and\ndon’t waste time wishing for a better one. They focus instead on\nhow they’re going to play the cards they have to achieve the best\nresult. They don’t hide behind others. The best people rise to the\nchallenge—whatever it is. They choose to live up to their best self-\nimage instead of surrendering to their defaults.\nOne of the most common mistakes people make is bargaining\nwith how the world should work instead of accepting how it does\nwork. Anytime you ﬁnd yourself or your colleagues complaining\n“that’s not right,” or “that’s not fair,” or “it shouldn’t be that way,”\nyou’re bargaining, not accepting. You want the world to work in a\nway that it doesn’t.\nFailing to accept how the world really works puts your time and\nenergy toward proving how right you are. When the desired results\ndon’t materialize, it’s easy to blame circumstances or others. I call\nthis the wrong side of right. You’re focused on your ego not the\noutcome.\nSolutions appear when you stop bargaining and start accepting\nthe reality of the situation. That’s because focusing on the next\nmove, rather than how you got here in the ﬁrst place, opens you up\nto a lot of possibilities. When you put outcome over ego, you get\nbetter results.\nHow You Respond Can Always Make Things Better or Worse\nYou can’t control everything, but you can control your response,\nwhich makes circumstances better or worse. Each response has an\nimpact on the future, taking you either a step closer to or a step\nfurther from the outcomes you want and the person you want to be.\nOne eﬀective question to ask yourself before you act is, “Will this\n\f\naction make the future easier or harder?”[*] This surprisingly simple\nquestion helps change your perspective on the situation and avoid\nmaking things worse. As my grandfather (and many others) used to\nsay, “If you ﬁnd yourself in a hole, the ﬁrst thing you need to do is\nstop digging.”\nOne day in my mid-twenties, I found myself in my mentor’s\noﬃce. I had missed out on a promotion—the ﬁrst one I’d been up\nfor and failed to get—and I was complaining to him about how\nunfair it was.\n“Why is this happening to me?” I remember saying. “Is someone\ntrying to send me a message?” I started talking trash about the\nperson who’d made the decision, when my mentor cut me oﬀ.\n“You’re refusing to accept something that already happened,” he\nsaid. “And that’s crazy.”\n“Crazy?” I replied.\n“Yes. It’s already happened. You can’t argue with it.”\n“Listen,” he continued, “it really sucks. You’re more than\nqualiﬁed. But you didn’t get it, and there is a reason you didn’t get\nit. The key here is to stop blaming others and take ownership.”\nI let his point sink in. He was right. The world didn’t just happen\nto me. It wasn’t out to get me. I needed to look inside myself,\nhonestly assess what I’d contributed to this outcome, and update\nmy way of doing things.\nAs I left my mentor’s oﬃce, the implication was clear. If I\ncouldn’t learn self-accountability, I wasn’t going to go very far.\nComplaining Is Not a Solution\nFacing reality is hard. It’s much easier to blame things we have no\ncontrol over than look for our own contributions.\nToo often we ﬁght against the feedback the world gives us, to\nprotect our beliefs. Rather than changing ourselves, we want the\nworld to change. And if we don’t have the power to change it, we\ndo the only thing we feel we can do: complain.\nComplaining isn’t productive. It only misleads you into thinking\nthat the world should function in a way that it doesn’t. Distancing\nyourself from reality makes it harder to solve the problems you\n\f\nface. There is always something you can do today to make the\nfuture easier, though, and the moment you stop complaining is the\nmoment you start ﬁnding it.\nYou Are Not a Victim\nThe most important story is the one you tell yourself. While telling\nyourself a positive story doesn’t ensure a good outcome, telling\nyourself a negative story often guarantees a bad one.\nEach of us is the hero of the story we tell ourselves about\nourselves. Being at fault when things go wrong doesn’t suit the hero\nstatus we ascribe to ourselves. So, when it comes to explaining why\nthings went wrong, we look for someone else to blame.\nWhile pointing ﬁngers when we don’t get the results we want\nmight satisfy us in the moment, it doesn’t give us better judgment,\nand it doesn’t make us better people. It’s instead a defensive\nreaction prompted by our ego default—a reaction that keeps us\nnestled in the arms of weakness and fragility.\nWhen you constantly blame circumstances, the environment, or\nother people, you are eﬀectively claiming that you had little ability\nto aﬀect the outcome. But that’s not what actually happened. The\ntruth is that we make repeated choices in life that become habits,\nthose habits determine our paths, and those paths determine our\noutcomes. When we explain away those unwanted outcomes, we\nabsolve ourselves of any responsibility for producing them.\nThere’s a word for people who always respond to problems by\nblaming others or circumstances: victims. Of course, they’re often\nnot actually victims. They just feel like they are, and that feeling\ngets in the way of good judgment. Chronic victims feel helpless,\npowerless, and often hopeless. Nothing is ever their fault; it is\nalways someone or something else that got in the way. No one\nbegins life wanting to be a chronic victim, but the slow\naccumulation of responses that avoid responsibility makes it hard\nfor people to see that’s what they’re becoming. Eventually, it’s just\nwho they are.\nThere are points in the process of becoming a chronic victim\nwhen people realize they’re lying to themselves. They realize the\n\f\nstory they’re telling themselves isn’t quite true. They know they’re\nresponsible. But facing reality and taking responsibility is hard. It’s\nuncomfortable. It’s so much easier to hide and to blame other\npeople, circumstances, or luck.\nIronically, the people who care the most about chronic victims\noften unintentionally encourage their blame game. When things\ndon’t go our way, it’s natural to vent to family members or close\nfriends. They’re loving and supportive and have the best intentions\nfor us. They would love to validate our interpretation of the\nsituation, and oﬀer us relief. But when they do that, nothing has\nchanged. Our incorrect view of the world remains intact. They don’t\nencourage us to re-evaluate our patterns of thinking, feeling, and\nacting. And if we’re thrust into similar circumstances later on, we’ll\nlikely respond the same way and get the same disappointing results.\nOn the other hand, have you ever had a friend tell you, “You\nmessed up pretty bad there. How can I help you make this right?”\nor “Let me tell you the one thing I think is holding you back from\ngetting the results you want”?\nIf you have a friend like that, call them now and thank them.\nTheir presence in your life is a rare gift. Cherish it!\nOr perhaps one of your parents has done that for you. When I\nwas thirteen years old, I was standing with a group of my friends\nafter school. They were teasing one of our classmates and I was\nwatching. The teachers intervened before things got out of control,\nand it ended as quickly as it began. I didn’t realize, however, that\nmy father was parked nearby, watching. When I got in the car, he\nasked me what had happened.\n“Nothing,” I said. My father looked at me with that parental look\nI now give my own kids. “We were just giving the guy a bit of a\nhard time,” I said.\n“Why?” he asked.\n“Everyone was doing it. It wasn’t serious. Relax.”\nHe stopped the car in the middle of the road, and gave me that\nlook again.\n“You chose to be there, and you chose not to stop it,” he said.\n“You can’t do stuﬀ just because everyone else is doing it and expect\nto get a free pass. You’re responsible for your choices. You’re better\n\f\nthan you were in that moment.”\nThen he didn’t say another word to me until the next day.\nThe lesson was an important one: the things you choose not to\ndo often matter as much as the things you choose to do. The real\ntest of a person is the degree to which they are willing to\nnonconform to do the right thing.\nIt took a while for me to realize that he was more disappointed\nin me for not stopping the others than for being there in the ﬁrst\nplace.[2] He didn’t want me to become a passive person—the kind\nof person whose behavior is dictated by the people and events\naround him. He didn’t want me to become a chronic victim of\ncircumstances.\nNo successful person wants to work with a chronic victim. The\nonly people who want to work with victims are other victims.\nIf you pay attention to chronic victims, you’ll notice how fragile\nthey are—how dependent their attitudes and feelings are on things\nthey don’t control. When things go their way, they’re happy; when\nthings don’t, they’re defensive, passive-aggressive, and occasionally\naggressive-aggressive. If their spouse is in a bad mood, they’re in a\nbad mood too. If they hit traﬃc on the way to work, they bring\ntheir anger and frustration to work with them. If a project they’re\nleading isn’t on track, they blame someone on their team.\nSelf-accountability is the strength of realizing that even though\nyou don’t control everything, you do control how you respond to\neverything. It’s a mindset that empowers you to act and not just\nreact to whatever life throws at you. It transforms obstacles into\nopportunities for learning and growth. It means realizing that the\nway you respond to hardship matters more to your happiness than\nthe hardship itself. And it means understanding that the best path is\noften just to accept things and move on."

You must know what you can do and what you can’t;\nyour powers and limitations, your strengths and vulnerabilities,\nwhat’s in your control and what isn’t. You know what you know,\nand what you don’t know. And you know, moreover, that you have\ncognitive blind spots—that there are things you don’t know, and\nyou don’t know you don’t know them—what Donald Rumsfeld\nfamously called “unknown unknowns.”\nIf you want to better understand your level of self-knowledge,\nask yourself how many times a day you utter the phrase “I don’t\nknow.” If you never say, “I don’t know,” you’re probably dismissing\nthings that surprise you or explaining away outcomes instead of\nunderstanding them.\nUnderstanding what you do and don’t know is the key to playing\ngames you can win.\nI witnessed a powerful display of self-knowledge recently, at a\ngroup dinner with a very successful friend who’d made a fortune in\nreal estate. A savvy investor at the dinner pitched him on a\ncompany he was taking private. The idea was one of the most\ncompelling I had heard in years.\nAfter hearing out the pitch, my friend paused for a second, took\na sip of water, and said, “I’m not interested in investing.” The entire\ntable sat in silence, wondering what we had missed. Someone\nﬁnally broke the silence by asking him why he was passing.\n\f\n“I don’t know anything about that space,” he said. “I like to stick\nto what I know.”\nAs we left the restaurant, the conversation continued. He\nadmitted that the pitch sounded great, he trusted the person, and\nthought investors would make a lot of money on the deal. (They\ndid.) Then he told me, “The key to successful investing is to know\nwhat you know and stick to it.”\nMy friend knew real estate well, and he knew if he played in that\nspace and was patient, he couldn’t help but be successful.\nIt’s Not the Size of Your Knowledge, but How You Use It\nKnowing just what it is that you know is among the most practical\nskills you can have. The size of what you know isn’t nearly as\nimportant as having a sense of your knowledge’s boundaries.\nAt dinner one night, Charlie Munger elaborated on the same idea\nmy real estate investor friend had put forth. He said, “When you\nplay games where other people have the aptitude and you don’t,\nyou’re going to lose. You have to ﬁgure out where you have an edge\nand stick to it.”\nIt’s not enough to know where you have an edge; you also have\nto know when you are operating outside of it. If you don’t know\nwhich side of the line you’re on, or that there even is a line at all,\nyou’re outside your boundaries.\nSelf-knowledge isn’t limited just to hard skills, though. It’s also\nabout knowing when you’re vulnerable to your defaults—the kinds\nof situations where circumstances do the thinking for you. Maybe\nyou’re prone to being overly emotional—to sadness, anger, or\nintrusive self-defeating thoughts. Maybe you have a short temper\nwhen you’re tired, or you become an ogre when you’re hungry.\nMaybe you’re acutely sensitive to social pressure and the threat of\nsocial scorn.\nKnowing about your strengths and weaknesses, your abilities and\ntheir limits is essential to counteracting your defaults. If you don’t\nknow your vulnerabilities, your defaults will exploit them to gain\ncontrol of your circumstances."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 2.3\nSelf-Control\nGive me that man\nThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him\nIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart.\n—WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, Hamlet\nSelf-control is the ability to master your fears, desires, and other\nemotions.\nEmotions are an inescapable part of human life. Mammals like us\nevolved to respond quickly to immediate environmental threats and\nopportunities—fear in response to a threat, enjoyment in response\nto a social-bonding experience, sadness in response to a loss. We\ncan’t eliminate these physiological reactions or the conditions that\ntrigger them. We can only manage how we respond to them.\nSome people are like corks bobbing around in the waves of an\nemotional sea. Their actions are in thrall to their emotions: anger,\njoy, sadness, fear—whatever gets triggered in the moment. Other\npeople, however, decide to take command of their life. They seize\nthe helm, decide where they want to go, and steer the ship in that\ndirection despite the waves. They still experience ups and downs\nlike everybody else; they just don’t allow those waves of emotion to\ndetermine the direction of their life. Instead, they turn the wheel as\nneeded using good judgment to keep themselves on course.\nSelf-control is about creating space for reason instead of just\nblindly following instincts. It’s about being able to view and\nmanage your emotions as if they were inanimate objects—things\nthat don’t have the power to determine what you do unless you let\n\f\nthem. It’s about putting distance between yourself and your\nemotions, and realizing that you have the power to determine how\nyou respond to them. You can react when they prompt you, or\ninstead think clearly and consider whether they’re worth following.\nThe emotion default tries to remove any distance between you\nand your emotions, triggering a reaction in the absence of any\ndeliberation. It wants to win the present moment, even if it means\nsabotaging the future. Self-control empowers you to keep emotion\nin check, though.\nIf you’ve ever seen a toddler throw a tantrum, you’ve seen what\nthe emotion default can do with someone who hasn’t learned self-\ncontrol. What’s truly frightening is that some adults are only\nmarginally better than a toddler at fending it oﬀ. These are people\nwho lack self-control and are routinely carried away by their\nemotions.\nA large part of achieving success is having the self-control to do\nwhatever needs to be done, regardless of whether you feel like\ndoing it at the moment. Emotional intensity is far less important in\nthe long run than disciplined consistency. Inspiration and\nexcitement might get you going, but persistence and routine are\nwhat keep you going until you reach your goals. Anyone can\nmaintain excitement for a few minutes, but the longer a project\ntakes, the fewer the people who can maintain their excitement for\nit. The most successful people have the self-control to keep going\nanyway. It’s not always exciting, but they still show up."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 2.4\nSelf-Conﬁdence\nSelf-conﬁdence is about trusting in your abilities and your value to\nothers.\nYou need self-conﬁdence to think independently and to stand\nﬁrm in the face of social pressure, ego, inertia, or emotion. You\nneed it to understand that not all results are immediate, and to\nfocus on doing what it takes to earn them eventually.\nChildren develop self-conﬁdence when they learn simple skills\nlike pulling up a zipper, tying their shoes, or riding a bike.\nEventually, that self-conﬁdence evolves and propels them to\ndevelop more complex abilities as adults—for instance, writing\nsoftware, painting murals, or cheering up a disheartened friend.\nSelf-conﬁdence empowers resilience in the aftermath of negative\nfeedback, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances.\nYou know what your abilities are and how they add value, whether\nother people appreciate them or not. If you’ve forged a healthy\nsense of self-conﬁdence, it will see you through whatever emerging\nchallenges and diﬃculties come your way.\nConﬁdence vs. Ego\nSelf-conﬁdence is what empowers you to execute diﬃcult decisions\nand develop self-knowledge. While the ego tries to prevent you\nfrom acknowledging any deﬁciencies you may have, self-conﬁdence\ngives you the strength to acknowledge those deﬁciencies. This is\nhow you learn humility.\nConﬁdence without humility is generally the same thing as\noverconﬁdence—a weakness, not a strength. Conﬁdent people have\n\f\nthe strength to admit weaknesses and vulnerabilities, to\nacknowledge that other people might be better at something than\nthey are, and to ask when they need help.\nIt’s only human to have doubts about whether you are up to a\ngiven task. Even the most capable people have doubts about this\nfrom time to time. But those who have self-conﬁdence never give in\nto feelings of despair or worthlessness. That’s just another ego trap.\nInstead, conﬁdent people stay focused on completing the task at\nhand, even if it involves relying on the help of others to do so.\nEvery successful task only further serves to deepen your trust in\nyourself, and that’s how conﬁdence is earned.\nConﬁdence also Comes from How You Talk to Yourself\nMore dreams die from a lack of conﬁdence than a lack of\ncompetence. But while conﬁdence is often a byproduct of our\naccomplishments, it also comes from how you talk to yourself.\nThat little voice in your head may whisper its doubts, but it\nshould also remind you of the many hardships and challenges\nyou’ve overcome in the past and the fact that you persevered. No\nmatter who you are, you’ve given that little voice many positive\nmoments to speak of. You learned to walk, despite falling down\nthousands of times. Maybe you failed a test at ﬁrst, but then ﬁgured\nout what went wrong, and nailed it the next time. Perhaps you were\nﬁred, but moved on and ended up in a better position as a result.\nMaybe your relationship ended or your business failed or you were\nscared the ﬁrst time you put on skis—whatever it was, you\novercame it, moved past it, and you’re stronger as a result.\nIt’s important to talk to yourself about the adversity you’ve\nfaced, because past hardship is where you get the conﬁdence to face\nfuture hardship.\nWhen I took my youngest son cliﬀ jumping, we faced a serious\ndilemma. After reaching the top and looking down at the twenty-\nﬁve-foot drop, he got scared and wanted to climb back down. That\nwasn’t possible, however, because the climb down was far more\ndangerous than the jump—one small error and he would have\nlanded on a bed of sharp rocks. The more he looked down, the more\n\f\nnervous he became. I had to do something to help him help himself\nout of this situation.\nThe ﬁrst thing we did was to focus on our breathing. Your breath\nis a powerful tool that helps you calm your mind. We started taking\na normal inhale and then immediately inhaling again with a smaller\nbreath. It’s the same way we naturally breathe when we’re sobbing,\nand the results are similarly soothing. Only once we had relaxed our\nphysical bodies could we change our inner dialogue.\nI asked him how he was talking to himself at that moment—and\nit wasn’t good. He was beating himself up, telling himself how\ndumb it had been to climb up in the ﬁrst place, how he should have\nknown better, and how scared he was. This is the same way we all\ntend to talk to ourselves sometimes—or at least it is in my\nexperience.\nThe second thing we did was change the conversation he was\nhaving inside his head. We know how the words we say to other\npeople impact how they feel, but we rarely think of how the words\nwe say to ourselves impact us. I asked him to list oﬀ some of the\nthings he’d already done that he had feared before doing them. The\nquestion was barely out of my mouth when he started to tell me\nabout snowboarding and the time we “mistakenly” ended up on a\ndouble black diamond and the ﬁrst time he went wakeboarding.\nThe list went on. There was no shortage of situations he’d been in\nthat had required courage.\nOnce he realized he had done diﬃcult things before for the ﬁrst\ntime, he went back to focusing on his breathing. Then he jumped.\nWithin seconds, he emerged from the water, and I could see his\nhuge smile as he climbed back up for round two.\nPeople who are conﬁdent aren’t afraid of facing reality because\nthey know they can handle it. Conﬁdent people don’t care what\nother people think about them, aren’t afraid of standing out, and\nare willing to risk looking like an idiot while they try something\nnew. They’ve been beaten down and rebuilt themselves enough\ntimes to know that they can do it again if they have to. Crucially,\nthey also know that to outperform the crowd, you have to do things\ndiﬀerently sometimes, and that hecklers and naysayers inevitably\ntend to follow. They take their feedback from reality, not popular\n\f\nopinion.\nThe most important voice to listen to is the one that reminds you\nof all that you’ve accomplished in the past. And while you might\nnot have done this particular thing before, you can ﬁgure it out.\nConﬁdence and Honesty\nSelf-conﬁdence is also the strength to accept hard truths. We all\nhave to deal with the world as it is, not as we want it to be. The\nquicker you stop denying inconvenient truths and start responding\nto diﬃcult realities, the better.\nWe all have something that we’re denying right now because\naccepting it is hard, and we want to avoid the pain. Maybe you’re in\na dead-end job or you’re about to go bankrupt, or you’re holding an\ninvestment that you have trouble admitting didn’t work out. The\nquicker you accept reality, though, the quicker you can deal with\nthe implications, and the sooner you do that, the easier those\nimplications are to manage. Most of the time, needing to wait for\nthe right moment to do a hard thing is just an excuse: a way to\nrationalize putting oﬀ what needs to be done. There is no perfect\nmoment.[1] There’s only the desire to continue waiting for one.\nPeople with self-conﬁdence are honest about their own\nmotivations, actions, and results. They recognize when the voice in\ntheir head might be ignoring reality. They also listen to the\nfeedback the world gives them, instead of shopping around for\nother opinions.\nThe internet makes it easy to ﬁnd people who agree with us no\nmatter what we believe. Want to deny the Holocaust? There’s a\ngroup for that. Think vaccines cause autism? Many others do as\nwell. Heck, we still have a ﬂat-earth society, whose membership\nspans around the globe.\nYou can quickly and easily be surrounded by people who share\nthe same delusions. That doesn’t make them true. Reality isn’t a\npopularity contest. Surrounding yourself with people who tell you\nyou’re right doesn’t mean you are. And once you dive into the\nwarm water of group acceptance, it’s hard to get back out. The\nsocial default strikes again!"

    "raw_text": "The groups we surround ourselves with encourage us to think\nthe problem is with the world and not with us. We think we are\nright and everyone else is wrong, denying reality at the expense of\nthe energy and focus we need to adapt and improve. We do this\nbecause it feels more comfortable than accepting reality, even\nthough it’s only after we accept reality that we can attempt to\nchange it. And we continue wondering, deep down, why we aren’t\ngetting the results we want. We wonder why some people get better\nresults than we do, and what they’re doing diﬀerently.\nI was taking a stroll one day with the CEO of a large public\ncompany, when we started discussing how he hired people for key\nroles.\nI asked, “If you could pick one trait that would predict how\nsomeone would turn out, what would it be?”\n“That’s easy,” he said. “How willing they are to change their\nmind about what they think they know.”\nThe most valuable people, he continued, weren’t the ones with\nthe best initial ideas, but the ones with the ability to quickly change\ntheir minds. They were focused on outcome over ego. By contrast,\nhe said, the people most likely to fail were those obsessed with\nminute details that supported their point of view.\n“They’re too focused on proving they’re right instead of being\nright,” he said.\nAs I mentioned previously in the chapter on self-accountability,\nthis is what I call the wrong side of right. It’s what happens when\notherwise smart people confuse the best outcome with the best\noutcome for them personally.[2]\nIn order to be right, you must be willing to change your mind. If\nyou’re not willing to change your mind, you’re going to be wrong a\nlot. The people who frequently ﬁnd themselves on the wrong side of\nright are people who can’t zoom in and out and see the problem\nfrom multiple angles. They get locked into one perspective: their\nown. When you can’t see a problem from multiple points of view,\nyou have blind spots. And blind spots get you in trouble.\nAdmitting you’re wrong isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of\nstrength. Admitting that someone has a better explanation than you\nshows that you’re adaptable. Facing reality takes courage. It takes\n\f\ncourage to revise your ideas, or rethink something you thought you\nknew. It takes courage to tell yourself something is not working. It\ntakes courage to accept feedback that bruises your self-image.\nThe challenge of facing reality is ultimately the challenge of\nfacing ourselves. We must acknowledge the things we cannot\ncontrol and focus our eﬀorts to manage the things we can. Facing\nreality demands acknowledging our mistakes and failures, learning\nfrom them, and moving forward.\nThe Wrong Side of Right\nOnce, in New York, after I’d given a talk on making eﬀective\ndecisions, a woman in the audience came up to me with a question.\nThe event had run late and I really had to get to the airport, which I\napologetically informed her. In response, she oﬀered to have her\ndriver take me to the airport, if she could pick my brain along the\nway.[*]\nAs we got into the car, she started telling me about a very\ndiﬃcult problem she was wrestling with. She was one of two\ncandidates to become the next CEO of her organization and felt like\nthe problem she was facing would make or break her chances. She\nwalked me through the details and told me her proposed solution.\nAlthough it sounded as though her idea would indeed solve the\nproblem, it was complicated and full of execution risk. But there\nwas an alternative—a solution that was simpler, lower cost, and\ncarried less risk. It was objectively a better solution. The only\nproblem was that it was her rival’s.\nAs she detailed some of her thinking, she spent a lot of time and\neﬀort defending herself, trying to prove her solution was the better\none. She only succeeded in making it clear that she knew her own\nsolution wasn’t the best. She was on the wrong side of right. She\njust didn’t want to admit it.\nMany people feel the same way: they think they’ll be worthless if\nthey’re not right. I myself used to feel the same way. Rather than let\nher ﬁgure out her mistake the hard way, I shared some of the harsh\nand expensive lessons I’d learned about that mindset and about\nbeing on the wrong side of right.\n\f\nI told her that for the longest time, I thought if the best idea\nwasn’t my idea, I’d be nothing. I thought that no one would see me\nas valuable, that no one would see me as insightful, that I wouldn’t\nbe contributing anything. I had my identity wrapped up in being\nright.\nIt wasn’t until I began running a business that I realized how\nwrong I’d been. When everything is on your shoulders and the cost\nof being wrong is high, I told her, you tend to focus on what’s right\ninstead of who’s right. The more I’d given up wanting to be right,\nthe better the outcomes I had. I didn’t care about getting the credit;\nI cared about getting the results.\n“If you owned 100 percent of this company and couldn’t sell it\nfor one hundred years,” I asked her, “which solution would you\nprefer?”\nThere was a long pause before she answered.\n“I know what I need to do,” she said. “Thank you.”\nA few months later, my phone rang. It was her.[*]\n“You won’t believe what happened!” she said. “I got the CEO job\nthanks in part to your help. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I\nended up supporting my rival’s solution, and that’s what ended up\ntipping the scales in my favor. When the board saw that I could put\naside my ego and do what was best for the company—even if it\nmeant supporting someone competing with me for the same role—\nthey knew I was the right person.”\nSelf-conﬁdence is the strength to focus on what’s right instead of\nwho’s right. It’s the strength to face reality. It’s the strength to\nadmit mistakes, and the strength to change your mind. Self-\nconﬁdence is what it takes to be on the right side of right.\nOutcome over ego.\n\f\nCHAPTER 2.5\nStrength in Action\nSelf-accountability, self-knowledge, self-control, and self-conﬁdence\nare essential to exercising good judgment. Here are a couple\nexamples of how they work together.\nExample 1: Going against the Norm\nMost people who work for a three-letter agency end up staying\nthere for their entire career. Why wouldn’t you? Great salaries, a\npension indexed to inﬂation, and a mission-focused organization\nfull of incredibly smart and dedicated people.\nWhen I told one of my colleagues I was quitting, they looked at\nme with surprise. They told me about all the risks, how I’d lose my\ngolden pension and my beneﬁts. They focused on what I was losing,\nnot what I was gaining: mainly, the freedom of my time.\nLeaving this job illustrates the four strengths in action. I had the\nself-conﬁdence that I could ﬁgure out what came next without\nneeding to know all the details, the self-knowledge to know that I\nvalued time over money, the self-control to get up the next day\nwithout missing a beat, and the self-accountability to set a higher\nstandard for performance than I ever had before.\nWithout self-knowledge, I never would have known what made\nme happy. Without self-conﬁdence, I never would have left.\nWithout self-accountability and self-control, I probably would have\nknown what to work on, but I would have ﬁlled my days with easy\nbusywork instead of the activities that moved me forward."

    "raw_text": "Example 2: Resisting the Social Default\nSuppose you know from experience that you’re susceptible to social\npressure. On numerous occasions, for instance, you’ve been cajoled\ninto buying things you didn’t want from pushy salespeople, and\nyou’ve agreed to take on jobs you didn’t have the bandwidth for by\npushy colleagues. You don’t trust yourself to do better in the future\nusing sheer willpower alone.\nTo protect yourself from the inﬂuence of the social default, you\ndecide to implement a safeguard. You form a rule for yourself:\nnever say yes to something important without thinking it over for a\nday.\nPracticing this safeguard isn’t very enjoyable. Putting someone\non hold for a day might be uncomfortable in the moment, but the\nlong-term results of implementing this safeguard are worth it. As\nsimple as they seem, automatic rules for common situations get\nresults. We’ll explore automatic rules in the next chapter.\nImplementing this plan illustrates all four of the strengths I’ve\nmentioned. Knowing your vulnerability to social pressure and the\nlimits of your power to resist it requires self-knowledge. Deciding to\ndo something about this vulnerability to secure better outcomes\ninvolves self-conﬁdence. Following the rule you’ve made for\nyourself takes self-accountability. And overcoming short-term\ndiscomfort in ordinary moments for long-term gain displays self-\ncontrol.[*]\nAll four of these strengths are necessary for resisting the\ninﬂuence of the social default. Once you have them all working\ntogether, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish. Now let’s\ntake a look at how to build those strengths.\n\f\nCHAPTER 2.6\nSetting the Standards\nIt is inevitable if you enter into relations with people on a regular\nbasis . . . that you will grow to be like them. . . . Place an extinguished\npiece of coal next to a live one, and either it will cause the other one to\ndie out, or the live one will make the other reignite. . . . Remember that\nif you consort with someone covered in dirt you can hardly avoid\ngetting a little grimy yourself.\n—EPICTETUS, Discourses\nThe ﬁrst step to building any of your strengths is raising the\nstandards to which you hold yourself, a practical matter of looking\naround at the people and practices that pervade your day-to-day\nenvironment.\nOur surroundings inﬂuence us—both our physical environment\nand the people around us. Few things are more important in life\nthan avoiding the wrong people. It’s tempting to think that we are\nstrong enough to avoid adopting the worst of others, but that’s not\nhow it typically works.\nWe unconsciously become what we’re near. If you work for a\njerk, sooner or later you’ll become one yourself. If your colleagues\nare selﬁsh, sooner or later you become selﬁsh. If you hang around\nsomeone who’s unkind, you’ll slowly become unkind. Little by little,\nyou adopt the thoughts and feelings, the attitudes and standards of\nthe people around you. The changes are too gradual to notice until\nthey’re too large to address.\nBecoming like the people around you means that over time you\ncome to adopt their standards. If all you see are average people, you\nwill end up with average standards. But average standards aren’t\ngoing to get you where you want to go. Standards become habits,\n\f\nand habits become outcomes. Few people realize that exceptional\noutcomes are almost always achieved by people with higher-than-\naverage standards.\nThe most successful people have the highest standards, not only\nfor others but for themselves. For instance, when I was once sent to\na remote location to work, I remember standing up in a meeting to\nexplain how some element of an operation worked. After a few\nmoments, another person, who was widely recognized as the expert\nin this specialty, interrupted and asked me to stop talking until I\nknew what I was talking about. Then he got up and explained it in\nmore detail than I thought possible. After the meeting I went to his\noﬃce and talked to him. He explained that while he didn’t know\nwhat it was like where I was from, the standard here was you don’t\nspeak unless you know what you’re talking about.\nChampions don’t create the standards of excellence. The\nstandards of excellence create champions.[*]\nHigh standards are consistent across top performers. When you\nlook at any athlete or team that performs on a level beyond what\nyou can explain by luck or talent, you ﬁnd a commitment to high\nstandards. The New England Patriots and their coach Bill Belichick\nhave won more games over a twenty-year span than any other NFL\nteam. Not only that, but they also did it with a salary cap designed\nto level the playing ﬁeld and make dynasties like theirs impossible.\nWhen all-star cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was the best in the\ngame at his position, was a few minutes late for a practice one day,\nCoach Belichick sent him home immediately.[1] Belichick didn’t\nmake a big deal about it, but he was ﬁrm. Revis wouldn’t be treated\ndiﬀerently from other players. Coach didn’t care what star players\ngot away with on other teams. Revis was a New England Patriot,\nand he had to rise to the team’s standards.\nThe best teachers expect more from their students and from\nthemselves. And more often than not, the students rise to meet\nthose expectations. The best leaders expect more from people; they\nhold them to the same standards they hold themselves—a higher\nstandard than most would otherwise know is possible."

    "raw_text": "Smart People with Low Standards\nThe diﬀerence between average and exceptional results for a leader\noften comes down to whether they’re consistently getting more out\nof smart but otherwise lazy people. I once found myself working\nwith one such fellow. I’d recently been promoted, and he sent me a\ndraft asking for my “guidance and feedback.” The draft was terrible\nand full of obvious ﬂaws. It wasn’t his best work. I knew it. And he\nknew it.\nIf you work in a large organization, I’m sure something similar\nhas happened to you. Someone creates a half-assed draft of\nsomething that’s full of poor thinking, sends it around, and waits for\nothers to correct it. This tactic takes advantage of one of our\ndefaults: we love correcting people. If someone does something\nwrong, we almost can’t help but tell them how to do it the right\nway. So you do the work, and they get the credit in a fraction of the\ntime it would’ve taken them to do it themselves. Smart. But lazy.\nI didn’t want to spend the rest of the evening (or my career)\ncorrecting this guy’s work for him. I needed a way of changing his\nbehavior. But how?\nI remembered a story I’d read about Henry Kissinger. A staﬀer\nhad drafted a memo and left it on Kissinger’s desk for him to read.\nA while later Kissinger approached him and asked if it was his best\nwork. The staﬀer said no and rewrote the entire memo. The next\nday the staﬀer ran into Kissinger again and asked what he thought.\nKissinger asked him again if this was the best he could do. The\nstaﬀer took the memo and rewrote it yet again. The next morning\nthe same scenario played out, only this time the poor staﬀer stated\nthat yes indeed it was his best work. Kissinger replied, “Okay, now\nI’ll read it.”\nI decided to adopt Kissinger’s approach. I simply replied to the\nemail with “Is this your best work?”\nThe fellow responded no, asked for a few days to clarify his\nthinking, and came back with a version he thought was\ndramatically improved. Without opening the document, I shot back\nthe same thing.\nHe replied, “Yes, this is the best I can do.”\n\f\nI read that version, and it was excellent. Now that I knew what\nhe was capable of and he knew that I knew, I told him I expected\nthat out of him every time. The standard was clear. I was never\ndisappointed.\nWhy We Have Low Standards\nMost of the time when we accept substandard work from ourselves,\nit’s because we don’t really care about it. We tell ourselves it’s good\nenough, or the best we can manage given our time constraints. But\nthe truth is, at least in this particular thing, we’re not committed to\nexcellence.\nWhen we accept substandard work from others, it’s for the same\nreason: we’re not all in. When you’re committed to excellence, you\ndon’t let anyone on your team half-ass it. You set the bar, you set it\nhigh, and you expect anyone working with you to work just as hard\nand level up to what you expect or above. Anything less is\nunacceptable.\nWhen Zhang Ruimin took over as CEO at the Qingdao\nRefrigerator Plant, the precursor to the appliance company Haier,\nthe company was close to failure. To send a clear signal to his new\nemployees, Ruimin gathered them outside to witness seventy-six\nsubstandard refrigerators smashed to pieces by a sledgehammer.\nRuimin kept a sledgehammer in a glass case in the boardroom for\nthe remainder of his tenure, as a symbol of the high standard he\nexpected from the company.[2]\nExcellence Demands Excellence\nMasters of their craft don’t merely want to check oﬀ a box and\nmove on. They’re dedicated to what they do, and they keep at it.\nMaster-level work requires near fanatical standards, so masters\nshow us what our standards should be. A master communicator\nwouldn’t accept a ponderous, rambling email. A master\nprogrammer wouldn’t accept ugly code. Neither of them would\naccept unclear explanations as understanding.\nWe’ll never be exceptional at anything unless we raise our"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 2.7\nExemplars + Practice\nThere are two components to building strength by raising the bar:\n(a) Choose the right exemplars—ones that raise your standards.\nExemplars can be people you work with, people you admire,\nor even people who lived long ago. It doesn’t matter. What\nmatters is they make you better in a certain area, like a skill,\ntrait, or value.\n(b) Practice imitating them in certain ways. Create space in the\nmoment to reﬂect on what they’d do in your position, and\nthen act accordingly.\nLet’s consider these components one at a time.\nIn the previous section, we discussed something most people\nnever think about: if you don’t curate the people in your life, the\npeople who end up surrounding you will be there by chance and\nnot by choice. That group includes your parents, your friends, your\nfamily, your coworkers. Sure, your high school friends might be\ngreat examples of character and acumen, but odds are they’re\naverage. Sure, your parents might be some of the smartest\nbusinesspeople in the world, but odds are they’re not. It’s not that\nyou should remove these people from your life, though; controlling\nyour environment just means intentionally adding exemplars into\nthe mix.\nYour Exemplars\nShow me your role models and I’ll show you your future."

    "raw_text": "When I ﬁrst started working at a three-letter intelligence agency,\nI looked up to my colleague Matt. He was one of the best in the\nworld at understanding how operating systems work and the\nvarious ways you can use them to your advantage. What struck me\nmost about Matt was his incredibly high standards. Like Michael\nJordan, Matt combined natural talent with a ﬁrst-class work ethic.\nAnd he demanded perfection. (Is it any wonder that he was one of\nthe best in the world?)\nYou couldn’t say anything around Matt unless you really knew\nwhat you were talking about, or he’d correct you. He raised the bar\nfor the entire team. Not only did he work harder than anyone else,\nbut he consistently came up with elegant solutions to complicated\nproblems. Matt was an exemplar: someone who modeled an\nexemplary way of being. He showed you what was possible.\nI got lucky. Chance could’ve given me an average boss. Instead,\nit gave me Matt. The thing is, though, you don’t have to rely on\nluck. It’s possible for you to choose the people whose behavior you\nemulate—your exemplars—rather than merely hope you end up\nworking with one of them.\nWhen you choose the right exemplars—people with standards\nhigher than yours—you can transcend the standards you’ve\ninherited from parents, friends, and acquaintances. Your exemplars\nshow you what your standards should be. As Peter Kaufman once\ntold me, “No technique has been more responsible for my success in\nlife than studying and adopting the good models of others.”\nThis wisdom has been around for a long time. In his letters to\nLucilius, Seneca urges him to choose a role model or exemplar to\nprovide a standard to live by:\nThe mind should have someone whom it can respect—\nsomeone whose authority might make even its inner shrine\nmore hallowed. . . . Happy is he who can so respect a man\nthat the very memory of that man can calm and direct him!\nHe who can thus respect another will quickly be respected\nhimself. Therefore, choose a Cato, or if this seems too strict\nfor you, choose a gentler spirit—a man like Laelius. Choose\nsomeone whose life and speech pleases you, and who displays\n\f\noutwardly the same character he has. Present him to yourself\nalways as your guardian or exemplar. There is need, I insist,\nfor someone against whom to measure our way of life; unless\nyou have a ruler, you can’t straighten what is crooked.[1]\nThe people we choose as our exemplars exhibit the principles, the\nresolve, and the overall patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting that\nwe want to make our own. Their example helps us navigate the\nworld. It becomes our North Star.\nMost people didn’t want to adopt Matt’s standards because those\nstandards were so exacting. Yet if you were willing to put in the\nwork, Matt was a shortcut to excellence hiding in plain sight.\nPeople at the far right of the bell curve (the positive outliers) can\nteach you tips, tricks, and insights that might otherwise take a\nlifetime to learn. They’ve done the heavy lifting. They’ve already\npaid for the lessons, so you don’t have to. Learning from and\nattempting to live up to Matt’s standards helped me become\nproﬁcient much faster than I would have become otherwise.\nLook around, ﬁnd the best examples you can of people with the\nattributes you want to cultivate—the people whose default behavior\nis your desired behavior, those who inspire you to raise the bar and\nmake you want to be a better version of yourself.\nYour exemplars needn’t be alive. They can be either dead or\nﬁctional, as well. We can learn from both Atticus Finch and Warren\nBuﬀett, along with Genghis Khan and Batman. It’s up to you.\nYour Personal Board of Directors\nPut all of your exemplars on your “personal board of directors,” a\nconcept that originates with author Jim Collins:\nBack in the early ’80s, I made Bill [Lazier] the honorary\nchairman of my personal board of directors. And when I\nchose members . . . they were not chosen for their success.\nThey were chosen for their values and their character. . . .\nThey’re the sorts of people I wouldn’t want to let down.[2]\n\f\nThe exemplars on your personal board can be a mix of high\naccomplishment and high character. The only requirement is that\nthey have a skill, attitude, or disposition you want to cultivate in\nyourself. They don’t have to be perfect. All people have ﬂaws, and\nyour personal board will be no diﬀerent. But everyone is better than\nus at something. Our job is to ﬁgure out what that something is and\nlearn from it while ignoring the rest.\nOne of the biggest mistakes that I see people make is they don’t\nwant to learn from someone who has a character blemish or a\nworldview that doesn’t align with theirs. Seneca captured the right\napproach when he said in On the Tranquility of the Mind, “I shall\nnever be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good.” Or, as\nCato the Elder put it, “Be careful not to rashly refuse to learn from\nothers.”[3] Don’t throw away the apple because of a bruise on the\nskin.\nYour personal board of directors isn’t static. People come and go.\nYou’re always curating the list. To take it back to The Godfather,\nsometimes you want the peacetime consigliere and sometimes you\nwant the wartime consigliere. Sometimes you’ve learned what you\ncan from someone, and you want to replace them with someone\nelse. Each person tends to lead you to the next.\nMasters have a diﬀerent standard—often one of elegance and\nbeauty. And when you put masters on your board, you raise the bar\nfor yourself. What seemed good enough before doesn’t seem good\nenough anymore.\nOne of my exemplars is Charlie Munger, the billionaire business\npartner of Warren Buﬀett. He raised my standard for holding an\nopinion. One night at dinner, he commented, “I never allow myself\nto have an opinion on anything unless I know the other side’s\nargument better than they do.”\nTalk about raising the bar! Many people have opinions, but very\nfew have done the work required to hold them. Doing that work\nmeans you can argue against yourself better than your real\nopponents can. It forces you to challenge your beliefs because you\nhave to argue from both sides. It’s only when you put in the work\nthat you come to really understand an argument. You understand\nthe reasons for and against it. Through that work you earn the\n\f\nconﬁdence to endorse it.[4]\nThere is no better way to learn than working directly with your\nheroes. The beneﬁt of working with someone in person is that it\nallows for a natural back-and-forth—more a coaching relationship\nthan a mere model. A personal relationship also allows you to ask\nfor help—to reach out when you need it. But working in person\nwith someone you admire isn’t always possible. Still, that doesn’t\nmean you have to accept the lot of people around you.\nThe phone in your pocket literally gives you access to the\nsmartest people who’ve ever existed, alive or dead. Even if you\ndon’t have direct contact with them, you can often listen to them\ntalk in their own words—unﬁltered! Think about that for a second.\nFor the ﬁrst time in history, you have the opportunity to listen to\nyour exemplars explain things in their own way, without someone\ngetting in the middle.[*]\nIf your hero is Tobi Lütke, who started Shopify, one of the most\nsuccessful companies in the history of the world, you can ﬁnd\ncountless interviews with him on the internet. You can sit at the\nfeet of the master and learn as he shares how he thinks, how he\nmakes decisions, how he runs his company. The same goes for Peter\nD. Kaufman, Warren Buﬀett, Jeﬀ Bezos, Tom Brady, Simone Biles,\nSerena Williams, or Katie Ledecky.\nYou can choose among the greats of history: Richard Feynman,\nGeorge Washington, Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Coco\nChanel, Charlie Munger, Marie Curie, Marcus Aurelius. All of them\nare ready to accept your invitation to be on your personal board.\nAll you need to do is collect the best of them together and unite\nthem in your mind. As Montaigne put it, “I have gathered a garland\nof other men’s ﬂowers, and nothing is mine but the cord that binds\nthem.”[5]\nYou’re never alone if you have a personal board of directors.\nThey’re always there. You can imagine them watching you make\ndecisions and power moves. And once you imagine them watching,\nyour behavior is bound to reﬂect this new audience. They will help\nset the standards that you strive to live up to, and give you a ruler\nagainst which to measure yourself. You’re not a failure if you come\nup short—if you don’t write a bestselling book, or become a"

Victory is being a little better today.\nYour Repository of Good Behavior\nChoosing the right exemplars helps create a repository of “good\nbehavior.” As you read what people have written, as you talk to\nthem, as you learn from their experiences, as you learn from your\nown experiences, you begin to build a database of situations and\nresponses. Building this database is one of the most important\nthings you’ll ever do because it helps create space for reason in your\nlife. Instead of reacting, and simply copying those around you, you\nthink, “Here’s what the outliers do.”\nWhen you face a new situation, you have a catalog of the\nresponses that people on the far right of the bell curve have had in\nsimilar situations. Your baseline response moves from good to great\n—from reaction to reason.\nYour board can pull you in the right direction despite your\ninstincts.\nIf we have our board stacked with high-character people, we’ll\nend up wanting to be the highest-character version of ourselves.\nWe’ll have the conﬁdence to take a moral stand, and to act alone\nwhen the social tide goes the wrong way.

You never know how or when you’ll have an impact, or\nhow important your example can be to someone else.”[6]\nMaybe it’s the new employee down the hall. Maybe it’s your\nkids. Maybe it’s your cousin. It doesn’t matter. What matters is\nthere’s someone out there looking up at you and using your\nbehavior as their North Star.

    "raw_text": "but even when he is in their thoughts!”[7]\nPractice, Practice, Practice\nStrengths of character result from habit. . . . We acquire them just as we\nacquire skills . . . we become builders, for instance, by building, and we\nbecome harpists by playing the harp. So too we become just by doing just\nactions, temperate by doing temperate actions, brave by doing brave actions.\n—ARISTOTLE, Nicomachean Ethics, Book 2, Chapter 1\nIt’s not enough just to pick exemplars and assemble a personal\nboard of directors. You also have to follow their example—not just\nonce or twice, but again and again. Only then will you internalize\nthe standards they embody, and become the kind of person you\nwant to be.\nImitating your exemplars involves creating space in the moment\nto exercise reason and evaluate your thoughts, feelings, and\npossible courses of action. Doing this retrains past patterns of\nbehavior so they align more closely with the patterns of your\nexemplars.\nOne way of creating space for reason in your thinking is to ask\nyourself what your exemplars would do if they were in your\nposition. It’s the natural next step. Once you imagine them\nwatching, you make decisions and put them into action. If, for\ninstance, you’re making an investment decision, ask yourself, “What\nwould Warren Buﬀett do?” Likewise, ask yourself, “How would I\npitch this idea to my personal board of directors? What kinds of\nfactors would they care about? What kinds of factors would they\ndismiss as irrelevant?”\nIf you imagine your exemplars watching you, you’d tend to do\nall the things you know they’d want you to do and avoid the things\nyou know would get in the way.\nIt’s important to engage in this thoughtful exercise often. You\nhave to keep doing it until you acquire a new pattern of thinking,\nfeeling, and acting. Keep practicing until the pattern becomes\nsecond nature: an element of who you are, rather than just who you\nwant to be.\nOne strategy for building strength is to practice in a sandbox. As\n\f\nyou may have guessed, the sandbox is metaphorical—a situation in\nwhich any mistakes you make are relatively inconsequential and\neasily reversed. A sandbox allows you to make and learn from\nmistakes while containing their cost. Practicing in a sandbox\nincreases the likelihood that you’ll be successful when the stakes are\nhigher and the outcomes more consequential and less reversible.\nOne reason why you usually start out managing just one other\nperson or a small team, rather than an entire organization, is that\nyour failures are contained. Starting with a small-scale management\nrole is one example of a sandbox. When you’re running a whole\norganization, mistakes are costlier and harder to contain than when\nyou’re managing a team.\nThere’s no substitute for practicing with the real thing, yet\nsandboxes can remove the downside of the mistakes you inevitably\nmake when practicing. At the intelligence agency, we’d always\npractice and rehearse before an operation in an environment in\nwhich it was safe to fail. We treated the practice as if it were the\noperation itself; we’d do all the things we planned on doing during\nthe operation, and tried to predict and respond to all the things that\ncould conceivably happen. If something didn’t go as planned, we\nwould adapt. And sometimes we’d fail. Failing in that sandbox,\nthough, provided a learning opportunity with few real-world\nconsequences, whereas failing in a real operation could cost people\ntheir lives."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 3.1\nKnowing Your Weaknesses\nWe all have weaknesses, many of which are built into our biology.\nWe are, for instance, vulnerable to being hungry, thirsty, fatigued,\nsleep deprived, emotional, distracted, or stressed. All of these\nconditions can push us toward reacting instead of thinking clearly,\nand blind us to the deciding moments of our lives.\nEach of us also has a limited perspective on things: we can see\nand know only so much. In addition, we have inbuilt tendencies to\nform judgments and opinions even in the absence of knowledge.\nWe’ve seen that our instincts for self-preservation, group\nmembership, hierarchy, and territoriality can all trigger bad\njudgments that harm us and the people around us.\nSome of our weaknesses aren’t built into our biology; instead\nthey are acquired through habit, and stay with us by force of\ninertia.\nBad habits are easy to acquire when there is a delay between\naction and consequence. If you eat a chocolate bar or skip a\nworkout today, you’re not going to suddenly go from healthy to\nunhealthy.

Moreover, we’re often unaware when they do.\nThe Two Ways of Managing Weakness\nThere are two ways to manage your weaknesses. The ﬁrst is to build\nyour strengths, which will help you overcome the weaknesses\nyou’ve acquired. The second is to implement safeguards, which will\nhelp you manage any weaknesses you’re having trouble overcoming\nwith strength alone. In addition, safeguards help us manage\nweaknesses that are impossible to overcome—for example, the ones\nwe owe to our biological limitations.\nHow to Manage Inbuilt Weaknesses\nSafeguards\n\f\nHow to Manage Acquired Weaknesses\nStrength + safeguards\nWe saw in Part 2 how strength can overcome weaknesses that\nwe’ve acquired. For example, developing self-control empowers you\nto overcome emotion-driven behavior and avoid the regrets it\nproduces. Developing self-conﬁdence empowers you to overcome\ninertia and execute diﬃcult decisions. It empowers you to overcome\nsocial pressure so that you have the strength to go against the\ncrowd. It also empowers you to overcome your ego, acknowledge\nyour deﬁciencies, and start on the path to doing and being better.\nBlind Spots\nSome of our weaknesses are the limitations on what we can know,\nour blind spots. We’re all familiar with perceptual blind spots—our\ninability to see accurately beyond a certain distance, and in\nenvironments without enough light. We have deaf spots, too; we\ncan’t hear sounds below a certain volume or above a certain pitch.\nWhat’s true of perception is also true of cognition—our ability to\nthink and judge. The cognitive capacities we’ve inherited from\nnatural selection weren’t designed to achieve maximum accuracy,\nbut only enough to increase our chances of survival and\nreproduction. In fact, some of these capacities weren’t designed for\naccuracy at all. They exist to prompt us to avoid serious threats to\nour survival and reproductive potential.\nThink of how a rabbit bolts even if you don’t pose a real threat\nto it. Rabbits have this behavioral tendency because, from an\nevolutionary perspective, they know it’s better to be safe than sorry.\nThe survival cost of a false negative is much higher than the cost of\na false positive. Many of our cognitive biases work the same way.\nThey were originally designed to bias us toward behaviors that\npromoted survival and reproduction, and away from behaviors that\nmight compromise them.\nFor example, both falling in with a group and acting swiftly on\nthe basis of limited information had survival value for our\nprehistoric ancestors. But both tendencies can trigger errors in\n\f\njudgment, and provide us with additional blind spots.\nKnowing about Your Blind Spots Isn’t Enough\nIt’s not enough to know about your biases and other blind spots.\nYou have to take steps to manage them. If you don’t, the defaults\nwill take control.\nSome blind spots are due to our perspective. None of us can\nknow everything about a situation from every angle. Think of poker\nplayers. If a player had complete information about who had which\ncards, they wouldn’t make any mistakes. As it is, players can see\nonly their own cards and just the ones dealt faceup. Because they\nare blind to the other hands, they make mistakes.\nWhile we can only guess why other people do what they do in\npoker or any other situation, our biggest blind spot tends to be\nknowing our own weaknesses. There’s a famous quote from Richard\nFeynman: “The ﬁrst principle is that you must not fool yourself—\nand you are the easiest person to fool.”[1]\nWe fail to see our own weaknesses for three main reasons.\nFirst, those ﬂaws can be hard for us to detect because they’re\npart of the way we’re accustomed to thinking, feeling, and acting.\nFlawed behavior has become ingrained through a long process of\nhabit formation. Those ﬂaws are part of who we are, even if it’s not\nin line with who we want to be.\nSecond, seeing our ﬂaws bruises our egos—especially when those\nﬂaws are behaviors that are deeply ingrained. They’re diﬀerent\nfrom shortcomings like, say, lacking a technical skill, because they\nfeel like a referendum on the kind of person we think we are. We\nare territorial about how we see ourselves and tend to dismiss\ninformation that challenges our self-image.\nThird, we have a limited perspective. It is very hard to\nunderstand a system that we are a part of. Just as you look back on\nyour sixteen-year-old self and wonder what you were thinking, your\nfuture self will look back on your current self and think the same\nthing. Your present self is blind to the perspective of your future\nself.\nPerspective and human nature make it hard to see our own\n\f\nﬂaws, and yet it’s easy to see the ﬂaws in others. We are practically\nexperts about where our colleagues and friends are weak and where\nthey are strong. It’s hard to accept, however, that others might see\nus just as clearly in kind. When we get feedback about our own\nweaknesses from the world, it’s a rare opportunity for getting better\nand getting closer to the kind of people we really want to be. Use\nthese opportunities wisely!\nBlind Spots on the USS Benfold\nThe story of the USS Benfold provides an important example of how\nto recognize and overcome blind spots.[2]\nThe Benfold was one of the worst-performing warships in the\nentire US Navy. Commissioned in 1996 for duty in the Paciﬁc Fleet,\nit housed one of the Navy’s most advanced arsenals of missiles and\ntechnology at the time. Its radar system was so advanced that it\ncould track a bird from ﬁfty miles. Its mission was to be prepared\nfor war at all times. But it was falling short.\nDespite otherwise brilliant military careers, previous\ncommanders had been unable to turn its performance around. So\nmuch of a ship’s performance comes down to people, not\ntechnology.\nThere’s nothing more important for a leader than getting the\nmost out of your crew. Often that comes down to removing\nobstacles that limit potential. All the technology in the world isn’t\ngoing to make you better if the people using it are checked out.\nThe destiny of the USS Benfold changed the day Michael\nAbrashoﬀ was named commander. He was in his mid-thirties when\nthe Navy oﬀered him the Benfold, his ﬁrst sea command. At the\ntime, he said, the “dysfunctional ship had a sullen crew that\nresented being there and could not wait to get out of the Navy.”\nAnd yet, in under twenty months, Abrashoﬀ turned the Benfold into\none of the highest-performing ships in the Navy. And he did it\nwithin a stiﬂing hierarchy.\nBut how?\nWhat’s incredible is how he didn’t do it. He didn’t ﬁre or demote\nanyone. He didn’t change the hierarchy. He didn’t change any\n\f\ntechnology. The only real change was within himself. He started to\nidentify his potential blind spots, and to look at the world from the\ncrew’s perspective.\nAbrashoﬀ observed one of the ship’s usual Sunday afternoon\ncookouts shortly after assuming command, and noticed a long line\nof sailors waiting to get their lunch while oﬃcers cut to the head of\nthe line to get their food. Not only that, but after getting their food,\nthe oﬃcers went to a private deck to eat apart from the sailors.\nImagine you’re a sailor on the ship and your boss comes and hops\nthe line in front of you. What message does this send? Does it make\nyou want to go all in on your job? Does it make you want to come\nup with new ideas to help the ship?\n“The oﬃcers weren’t bad people,” Abrashoﬀ recalls, “they just\ndidn’t know any diﬀerent. It’s always been that way.” Rather than\napproaching the oﬃcers and telling them what to do (a typical\ncommand-and-control approach that rarely works in the long term),\nAbrashoﬀ simply went to the end of the line.\nA supply oﬃcer approached him and said, “You don’t\nunderstand. You go to the head of the line.” Abrashoﬀ shrugged this\noﬀ, saying it didn’t seem right to him. He waited in line, got his\nfood, and then sat down with the sailors. The next weekend\neveryone waited in line and ate together. No command was ever\nissued.\nFrom the start, Abrashoﬀ knew you can’t simply order people to\nbe better. Even if that appears to work, the results are short term\nand the consequences enormous. It doesn’t matter if you’re on a\nship or running a manufacturing company. You don’t tap into\npeople’s resourcefulness, intelligence, and skills by command-and-\ncontrol.\n“Show me an organization in which employees take ownership,\nand I will show you one that beats its competitors,” says Abrashoﬀ.\n“Captains need to see the ship from the crew’s perspective. They\nneed to make it easy and rewarding for crew members to express\nthemselves and their ideas.”[3]\nThere is a gap in our thinking that comes from believing that the\nway we see the world is the way the world really works. It’s only\nwhen we change our perspective—when we look at the situation\n\f\nthrough the eyes of other people—that we realize what we’re\nmissing. We begin to appreciate our own blind spots and see what\nwe’ve been missing."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 3.2\nProtecting Yourself with Safeguards\nThere are many inbuilt biological vulnerabilities that can impede\ngood judgment: sleep deprivation, hunger, fatigue, emotion,\ndistraction, stress from feeling rushed, and being in an unfamiliar\nenvironment are just some examples. We can’t avoid ﬁnding\nourselves in these conditions from time to time. But we can\nimplement safeguards to protect us from our defaults when we are.\nSafeguards are tools for protecting ourselves from ourselves—\nfrom weaknesses that we don’t have the strength to overcome.\nHere’s a simple example. Suppose you want to start eating a\nhealthier diet. You make this task exponentially harder on yourself\nif you inhabit an unhealthy environment—if, say, your pantry and\nfridge are full of junk food. Purging your home of all junk food is a\nsafeguard. It protects you against impulsively ripping open a bag of\npotato chips when you’re feeling hungry or bored. Of course, you\ncan still go to the store and buy chips, but that’s a lot of work. You\nhave to think, plan, and act. In the time it takes you to do all that,\nyou might think better of your options, and choose to eat something\nmore in line with your health goals.\nPurging your home of all junk food is an example of one\nsafeguarding strategy: increasing the amount of “friction” required\nto do something that’s contrary to your long-term goals. There are\nlots of safeguard strategies, though. My favorites include\nprevention, creating rules for yourself, making checklists, shifting\nyour frame of reference, and making the invisible visible. Let’s talk\nabout each strategy.\n\f\nSafeguard Strategy 1: Prevention\nThe ﬁrst kind of safeguard aims at preventing problems before they\nhappen. One way to do this is to avoid decision-making in\nunfavorable conditions. Stress, for instance, is a big contributor to\nbad decisions. Some studies have shown that stress short-circuits\nthe deliberation process—it undermines the systematic evaluation\nof alternatives that’s needed for eﬀective decision-making.[1]\nAlcoholics Anonymous has a helpful safeguard for its members.\nThey call it HALT—an acronym that stands for Hungry, Angry,\nLonely, and Tired. When you feel like having a drink, they say, ask\nyourself whether any of these conditions apply. If so, deal with the\nreal problem—hunger, anger, loneliness, or fatigue—instead of\nreaching for a drink.\nYou can use the principles behind HALT as a safeguard for\ndecision-making in general. If you have an important decision to\nmake, ask yourself: “Am I hungry? Am I angry or otherwise\nemotional? Am I lonely or otherwise stressed by my circumstances,\nsuch as being in an unfamiliar environment or pressed for time? Am\nI tired, sleep-deprived, or physically fatigued?” If the answer is yes\nto any of these questions, avoid making the decision if you can.\nWait for a more opportune time. Otherwise, your defaults will take\nover.\nSafeguard Strategy 2: Automatic Rules for Success\nReactive choices are automatic responses to a stimulus. Most of\nthese responses are below the level of consciousness: We’re not even\naware of them. Sometimes we’re able to slow down enough to\noverride our ingrained responses, but this requires a lot of conscious\neﬀort on our part. Fortunately, there’s an easier way: creating new\nbehaviors that help you get what you want. Think of them as\nautomatic rules for success.\nNothing forces you to accept the ingrained behaviors and rules\nfrom your upbringing and life circumstances. You can decide to\neliminate them at any time, and replace them with better ones.\nIn my conversation with Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, the\n\f\ngodfather of cognitive biases and thinking errors, he revealed an\nunexpected way we can improve our judgment: replacing decisions\nwith rules.[2] It turns out that rules can help us automate our\nbehavior to put us in a position to achieve success and accomplish\nour goals.\nWhen we make decisions, we often think of the goals we want to\nachieve and work backward to identify the means of achieving\nthem. If you want to get in shape, you start going to the gym and\neating healthier. If you want to save more money, you might hide\npart of your paycheck from yourself every week. We use our\nwillpower to accomplish these goals. Once they’re accomplished,\nwe often go back to the default behavior we had before. Eventually\nwe realize we’re back where we don’t want to be, so we begin the\nentire process again.\nThis approach is ﬂawed. It involves constant decision-making\nand eﬀort. Choosing goals is necessary but not suﬃcient for\naccomplishing them. You also need to pursue those goals\nconsistently. That means continuing every day to make choices in\npursuit of your goals. Every day, you have to choose to work out or\nto skip dessert. As these choices add up, it becomes harder, not\neasier, to consistently make choices that move you toward your\ngoals and not away from them.\nMaking all these choices requires a lot of sustained eﬀort. When\nwe cave into something we didn’t want to do, we oﬀer ourselves\nconvenient excuses: “I had a long day,” or “I forgot my gym\nclothes,” or “I have a lot of prep for tomorrow’s meeting.”\nEventually it becomes easier to make those excuses than to make\nthe choices that lead us to our goals.\nWhen it comes to your health, just like many other elements of\nyour life, environment determines behavior. Your environment\nmakes one path easier than another.[*] It’s easier to make healthy\nfood choices if the only foods available to you are good for you. It’s\nalso easier to stick to a consistent pattern of choices if you’re in\nyour familiar operating environment. When you’re in an unfamiliar\nenvironment, it’s harder to maintain your familiar patterns of\nbehavior, which is why a lot of people stop exercising or eating\nhealthy when they travel.\n\f\nYour environment isn’t just your physical surroundings. It also\nincludes people. Sometimes it’s hard saying no to someone. We’re\nwired in a way that makes us want to be liked by others, and we’re\nafraid that saying no to someone will make them like us less. Saying\nno to someone repeatedly can be even more diﬃcult. We might say\nno when our friend oﬀers us a sugary beverage after a workout one\nday, but if he does it three days in a row, we cave. That’s only\nhuman.\nWe’re also wired to want to ﬁt in with other people. Think of\nhow often you have ended up having a social drink when you really\njust wanted water. Your friends or colleagues ordered ﬁrst—a glass\nof wine, say—and you somehow felt guilty about not ordering a\ndrink yourself. So, you order wine too and compromise on what you\nreally want.\nWhy not bypass individual choices altogether and create an\nautomatic behavior—a rule—that requires no decision-making in\nthe moment and that gets no pushback from others? Why not set a\nrule that you order a social drink only when you actually feel like\none, and never just to ﬁt in with what the group is doing?\nSimilarly, suppose your goal is to drink less soda.[*] Rather than\ndeciding on a case-by-case basis whether you’re going to drink soda\n—something that requires a lot of eﬀort and that is prone to error—\nmake a rule instead. For example, “I only drink soda at dinner on\nFriday,” or maybe, “I don’t drink soda at all.” Having a rule means\nnot having to decide at every meal. The execution path is short, and\nless error prone.\nIn a quirk of psychology, people typically don’t argue with your\npersonal rules. They just accept them as features of who you are.\nPeople question decisions, but they respect rules.\nKahneman told me his favorite rule was never to say yes to a\nrequest on the phone. He knows that he wants people to like him,\nso he wants to say yes in the moment, but after ﬁlling up his\nschedule with things that didn’t make him happy, he decided to be\nmore vigilant about what he agrees to do and why. When people\nask him for things over the phone now, he says something along the\nlines of, “I’ll have to get back to you after I think about it.” Not only\ndoes this give him time to think without the immediate social\n\f\npressure, but it also allows a lot of these requests to just drop away\nbecause people choose not to follow up. He rarely gets back to any\nof these people and says yes.[*]\nAfter speaking with Kahneman, I spent some time thinking about\nwhat automatic rules I could create for myself so that my desire in\nthe moment didn’t overpower my ultimate desire.\nThe way I did this was to imagine a ﬁlm crew following me\naround documenting how successful I was.[*] Regardless of whether\nI was a success or not, how would I act to show someone I deserved\nmy success? What would I want them to see? What am I doing that\nI would want them not to see because I’m embarrassed or ashamed?\nWhen I run this experiment by people, I am constantly surprised.\nWe all know something we could do to improve our odds of success.\nAnd we all know something we can stop doing that would also\nimprove our odds of success.\nJust because I can’t control all the things I need to do doesn’t\nmean I can’t control when I do them. The version of me that I’d\nwant the ﬁlm crew to see focused on what mattered.\nUsing this prompt, I decided to create space every day to work\non the biggest opportunities. I imagined the ﬁlm crew watching me\nmake breakfast for the kids and then going to work. While the crew\nwould be expecting to see meetings and people asking me for\nthings, what they’d see is no calls or meetings until lunch so I could\nspend time working on the most important opportunity. This is\nwhere my no-meetings-before-lunch rule came from.[*]\nWe’re taught our whole lives to follow rules, and yet no one ever\ntold us about how we can create powerful rules that help us get\nwhat we want. I ﬁnd it hard to go to the gym three days a week, so\nmy rule is I go every day. I do not feel like going to the gym every\nday. In fact, some days I hate it. I also know it’s easier to follow my\nrule than to break it. When it comes to the gym, going every day is\neasier than going some days.\nCreating personal rules is a powerful technique for protecting\nyourself from your own weaknesses and limitations. Sometimes\nthose rules have surprising beneﬁts."

    "raw_text": "Safeguard Strategy 3: Creating Friction\nAnother safeguarding strategy is to increase the amount of eﬀort it\ntakes to do things that are contrary to your goals. I used to ﬁnd\nmyself checking my email whenever I have a second. I’d check it\nbefore I got out of bed, on the walk home from work, in line at the\ngrocery store.\nIt’s easy to tell myself that I’m not the only one, that everyone\ndoes this too. The dopamine hit of something new prevents many of\nus from working on our priorities. It isn’t just that I was spending\ntoo much time on email, though, it’s that email could hijack my\ntime from what’s important. The scary thing is, I often wanted it to\ntake me away from what I was supposed to be doing.\nConsider a major report I needed to complete early in my career.\nI would get to work and rather than write the report, which was\nclearly the most important thing for me to do, I’d check my email. If\nthere was anything in my inbox that required even a modicum of\nattention, I’d tell myself I needed to do that before starting on the\nreport. And, of course, by the time I was done with that ﬁrst email,\nmore had come in that needed attention. It didn’t take much to\nconvince myself I needed to do that before I started. Only near the\nend of the workday would I ﬁnally sit down to write the report,\nmentally exhausted.\nWhen you step back and think about it for a second, I was giving\none of the most important things I wanted to do the worst of\nmyself. Email, which I dread on the best of days, was getting my\nmost energetic and creative self. Many of us do this with our\npartners too. By the time everything we need to do over the course\nof a long day is ﬁnished, we’re exhausted. And this is the time we\ngive to our spouse, the most important person in our lives!\nIf there were a recipe for accumulated disaster, it would be\ngiving the best of ourselves to the least important things and the\nworst of ourselves to the most important things.\nThe path to breaking bad habits is making your desired behavior\nthe default behavior. To get on track with the report, I told my\ncolleagues that until the report was submitted, I’d buy them all\nlunch if they caught me with my email open before 11:00 a.m. My\n\f\nbeing competitive and not wanting to buy them lunch created\nenough friction to keep me from checking it ﬁrst thing in the\nmorning.\nI’d work free from distraction all morning. In the afternoon, I’d\ndo email, take calls, and attend or conduct meetings. It’s incredible\nhow much I got done.\nIt’s easy to underestimate the role ease plays in decision-making.\nSince behavior follows the path of least resistance, a surprisingly\nsuccessful approach is to add friction where you ﬁnd yourself doing\nthings you don’t want to do.\nSafeguard Strategy 4: Putting in Guardrails\nAnother safeguarding strategy is to formulate operating procedures\nfor yourself because you know from hard experience when your\ndefaults tend to override your decision-making. The defaults\nprevent us from seeing what’s actually happening and from\nresponding in ways aligned with our best self-image.\nWe’ve already discussed setting automatic rules such as\nKahneman’s resolution to not say yes to things on the phone, and\navoiding making important decisions under unfavorable conditions.\nThere are other eﬀective safeguarding procedures, though, that also\nforce you to slow down in the moment, creating a pocket of time in\nwhich to think more clearly about any situation. These procedures\nmake us take a step back and ask, “What am I trying to achieve?”\nand “Is this moving me closer to that or further away?” These seem\nlike basic questions, but they’re often forgotten in the heat of the\nmoment.\nChecklists, for instance, oﬀer a simple way to override your\ndefaults. Pilots go through a preﬂight checklist every time they ﬂy.\nSurgeons go through preoperative checklists every time they\noperate. You might have a packing checklist every time you travel.\nIn each of these cases, the checklist acts as a safeguard, forcing us\nto slow down whatever we’re doing and go back to basics: “What\nam I trying to accomplish? And what are the things I need to\naccomplish it?” Questions like these are the guardrails that will\nkeep you on the road to success.[*]"

    "raw_text": "Safeguard Strategy 5: Shifting Your Perspective\nEach of us sees things only from a particular point of view. Nobody\ncan possibly see everything. That doesn’t mean, however, that we\ncan’t shift the way we see things in any given situation.\nIn physics, a frame of reference is a set of coordinates for\nobserving events. Diﬀerent observers occupy diﬀerent frames of\nreference, and what’s visible from one isn’t necessarily visible from\nanother. For example, you occupy one frame of reference if you’re\nseated in a traveling train car, while I occupy a diﬀerent one if I’m\nstanding at the station, watching your train pass by. Within your\nframe of reference, you and the bench on which you’re sitting are\nstationary. From mine, though, you and the bench are both moving\nfast.\nImagine now that it were possible for you to shift your frame of\nreference. What if, for instance, I were live streaming the approach\nof your train to you? You would then be able to see yourself and\nyour position from my perspective, giving you more information\nabout your situation that wasn’t visible from your frame of\nreference. Suppose your train were on a collision course with an\nobstacle on the tracks ahead that was only visible from my frame of\nreference. Within your view, everything would seem ﬁne. You\nwouldn’t know you were headed toward disaster. Shifting your\nframe of reference and seeing things from my perspective would\ngive you crucial information and enable you to take steps to avoid a\ncatastrophe.\nWhat applies in the train example applies to many other cases.\nWhile you might be seated on your couch reading this book and not\nmoving at all, from the sun’s point of view, you’re moving at sixty-\nseven thousand miles per hour around it. Having an outside\nperspective on your situation allows you to see more of what’s\nactually happening. Changing your perspective changes what you\nsee.\nShifting your frame of reference is a powerful safeguard against\nblind spots. Earlier, we saw that Michael Abrashoﬀ was able to turn\naround the performance of the USS Benfold by shifting his frame of\nreference. Rather than continuing to see things from the Benfold’s\n\f\nestablished frame of reference—a frame in which it was normal for\noﬃcers to treat sailors as second-class citizens—Abrashoﬀ shifted\nhis frame of reference and looked at things instead from the\nperspective of ordinary sailors and ordinary fairness.\nI once had a coworker who was also a friend. One day he walked\ninto my oﬃce with some news. “I ﬁgured out what I’m doing\nwrong,” he said. “I’m so busy trying to prove to everyone I’m right\nthat I can’t see the world from their point of view.”\nThe problem wasn’t that he wasn’t smart. He was. It wasn’t that\nhe didn’t work hard. He did. The problem was that he couldn’t\nrelate to other people because he hadn’t even made any eﬀort to see\nthings through their eyes. Now he’d come to realize it himself and\nstarted to change his behavior.\nFrom that point on, whenever he discussed something with\nanyone at work, he would start by oﬀering his impressions of how\nthe other person saw things. Then he would ask, “What did I miss?”\nAsking this question is a clever move. It implies that he’s open to\ncorrection and gives the other person a chance to correct him. One\nof the deepest-rooted human instincts is to correct other people, so\nby asking this question, he makes it easy for the other person to\nengage with him. Then, if the other person does in fact correct him,\nit reveals to him which factors are most important to that person.\nWhen the other person is done answering that ﬁrst question, my\nfriend still doesn’t oﬀer his own thoughts right away. He ﬁrst asks a\nfollow-up: “What else did I miss?”\nThis approach to interpersonal communication is an example of\na reference-shifting safeguard. Asking the two questions, and\nlistening to the answers people give him, forces him to see things\nthrough other people’s eyes. Taking the time to do that protects him\nagainst a tendency that he identiﬁed as a weakness.\nA few months after making the change, he became a conduit\nbetween his team and the rest of the organization. As time went on,\npeople started asking that he accompany his boss to meetings.\nWhen his boss eventually moved to a new role, everyone wanted\nhim to ﬁll the vacancy. He never even had to ask.\n\f\nCHAPTER 3.3\nHow to Handle Mistakes\nMistakes are an unavoidable part of life. Even the most skilled\npeople make mistakes, because there are so many factors beyond\nour knowledge and control that impact our success. This is true\nespecially when we’re pushing the boundaries of knowledge or\npotential. On the frontier of what we can know or do, there are no\nwagon tracks to follow, no familiar landmarks, no mile markers, no\nroad maps to guide us. We’re moving forward without the beneﬁt of\nanyone else’s hindsight. Missteps will happen. Part of taking\ncommand of our lives is managing those missteps when they do\nhappen.\nWhen things don’t work out the way we’d like, most of us default\nto blaming the world rather than ourselves. This is a form of what\npsychologists call self-serving bias: a tendency to evaluate things in\nways that protect or enhance our self-image, which I mentioned\nearlier when discussing self-accountability. When people succeed at\nsomething, they tend to attribute their success to their own ability\nor eﬀort: “I’m really smart”; “I worked really hard”; “I knew all the\nangles.” By contrast, when people fail at something, they tend to\nattribute their failure to external factors: “My boss doesn’t like me,”\n“The test was unfair,” etc.\nIn other words, “Heads, I’m right. Tails, I’m not wrong.”\nIf you got some results you didn’t want, the world is telling you\nat least one of two things:\n(a) you were unlucky;\n(b) your ideas about how things work were wrong."

When you repeatedly don’t get the\noutcomes you want, though, the world is telling you to update your\nunderstanding.\nMany people don’t want to hear that their ideas are wrong. They\ndon’t want to be conscious of the ﬂaws in their thinking and would\nprefer instead to sleepwalk through life. They do this in part\nbecause recognizing that their ideas are wrong is a blow to their\nself-image: it’s proof that they’re not as smart or knowledgeable as\nthey’ve believed themselves to be. That’s the ego default at work.\nIf you want to see whether your thinking is wrong, you need to\nmake it visible. Making what was previously invisible visible gives\nus the best chance of seeing what we knew and what we thought at\nthe time we made a decision. Relying on memory won’t work\nbecause the ego distorts information to make us look better than we\nactually were.\nOnce you realize that it’s time to update your ideas, though,\nchanging what you believe about the world requires a lot of work.\nSo people tend to ignore what the world is trying to tell them. They\nkeep doing what they’ve always done and keep getting the same\nresults. That’s the inertia default at work.\nMistakes Present Us with a Choice\nAs with anything else, there are better and worse ways of handling\nmistakes. The world doesn’t stop just because you made a mistake.\nLife goes on, and you need to go on too. You can’t simply throw\nyour hands up and walk away. There are other decisions to make,\nother things to accomplish, and hopefully you won’t repeat that\nkind of mistake in the future.\nEveryone makes mistakes because everyone has limitations. Even\nyou. Trying to avoid responsibility for your decisions, your actions,\nor their outcomes, though, is tantamount to pretending you don’t\nhave limitations. One thing that sets exceptional people apart from\nthe crowd is how they handle mistakes and whether they learn from\nthem and do better as a result.\nMistakes present a choice: whether to update your ideas, or"

The ﬁrst mistake is expensive; the second one\ncosts a fortune.\nMy kids learned this the hard way. One day, I came home to ﬁnd\na weird piece of broken glass on the ﬂoor. I held it up and asked\nwhat had happened, and they pleaded ignorance. When I opened\nthe garbage, though, and moved a sheet of paper that seemed to\nhave been carefully placed on top, I found the remains of a\nshattered vase.

Even if the mistake isn’t entirely your\nfault, it’s still your problem, and you still have a role to play in\nhandling it.\nWhen mistakes happen, the emotion default works hard to usurp\ncontrol over the situation.

If it’s an emergency, and you don’t have time to reﬂect at the\nmoment, be sure to come back to it. If you don’t identify the\nproblem’s causes, after all, you can’t ﬁx them.

It could be a matter\nof building a strength like greater self-accountability or greater self-\nconﬁdence.

That doesn’t mean\nit happens instantly, though. Just as it takes a while for a wound to\nheal, it takes a while for a relationship to heal. It’s not enough to\n\f\naccept the impact of your behavior and sincerely apologize. You\nneed to be consistent in doing better going forward. Any immediate\ndeviation quickly reverses any repair.\nNot all mistakes are like this. Some mistakes have consequences\nthat are irreversible. The key here is not letting a bad situation\nbecome a worse situation.\nA friend of mine is the general manager of a major sports team.\nWhen talking about mistakes, he told me about a mentor of his who\nhad made a “bad trade” based on impulse, not reason. After the\npaperwork was signed, he couldn’t take it back. His mentor knew it\nwas a mistake before the player suited up for their ﬁrst game. His\ninner voice, the inner saboteur we all have, told him he was an\nimposter and now the whole world knew it. It told him he was an\nidiot. That little voice undid years of exceptional player\nmanagement, eroding his conﬁdence and paralyzing him, rendering\nhim unable to make eﬀective decisions under uncertainty. He kept\nthinking that gathering more data would help him remove\nuncertainty. It wasn’t long before he lost his job.\nMistakes turn into anchors if you don’t accept them. Part of\naccepting them is learning from them and then letting them go. We\ncan’t change the past, but we can work to undo the eﬀects it’s had\non the future.\nThe most powerful story in the world is the one you tell yourself.\nThat inner voice has the power to move you forward or anchor you\nto the past. Choose wisely."

    "raw_text": "PART 4\nDECISIONS: CLEAR THINKING IN\nACTION\nIf you choose not to decide, you still have made a\nchoice.\n—NEIL PEART\nONCE YOU HAVE reprogrammed your defaults to create space for\nclear thinking, you must master the skill of decision-making.\nDecisions are diﬀerent from choices. If you casually select an\noption from a range of alternatives, you’ve made a choice. If you\nreact without thinking, you’ve made an unconscious choice. But\nneither of these is the same as a decision. A decision is a choice\nthat involves conscious thought.\nThe decision = the judgment that a certain option is the best one\nOften what seems like poor judgment in hindsight doesn’t even\nregister as a decision in the moment. When the defaults conspire,\nwe react without thinking. And that reaction doesn’t even count as a\ndecision. Once we register the opportunity to make a conscious\nchoice, the question becomes: How can we make the best decision\npossible?\nThe decision itself should represent the outcome of the decision-\nmaking process. That process is about weighing your options with\nthe aim of selecting the best one, and it’s composed of four stages:\ndeﬁning the problem, exploring possible solutions, evaluating the\noptions, and ﬁnally making the judgment and executing the best\noption. We will discuss each of these components in detail\nthroughout this chapter.\n\f\nIf you don’t apply this process, your choice doesn’t necessarily\ncount as a decision.\nSmall children tend to make choices without any kind of\nevaluation. Sometimes adults do too. Perhaps it’s because we have\nto make a choice so quickly that we don’t have time to evaluate the\noptions. Or maybe it’s because we let habit choose for us, the inertia\nof past choices carrying us through the present moment without\nexploring our options. Or maybe it’s just that we let our emotions\nmake choices without even realizing it—momentary anger, fear, or\ndesire preempting evaluation and pushing us to act without thinking\nor reason.\nNone of these examples count as decisions. That doesn’t mean\nwe’re not responsible for them. We are! It simply means we’re not\nreasoning. We’re not consciously thinking. Instead, we’re reacting,\nand giving up our deciding moment to our defaults. It’s in these\nmoments that we often do something contrary to what we’d decide is\nbest if we reasoned instead of reacted. When we react without\nreason, we cause more problems than we solve. If only we had the\nhindsight of our future selves as our foresight now!\nNot every bad decision is rushed, nor is every good one made\nslowly. It’s not that simple.\nPeople mistake choosing for decisiveness and the decision-\nmaking process for waﬄing. Part of what makes slowing down and\nreasoning through a problem diﬃcult is that, to the outside observer,\n\f\nit might look like inaction. But inaction is a choice.\nWhen the stakes are low, inaction hurts you more than speed.\nSometimes it’s better just to make a quick choice and not spend\ntime deliberating. Why waste time evaluating if an action is\ninconsequential and its eﬀects are easily reversed? For example, if\nthere are two identical squat racks in the gym and both are\nmomentarily open, it makes no diﬀerence which one you take. If you\nwait and decide, they’ll both be taken by someone else. Just choose\neither one.\nWhen the stakes are higher, though, speed can hurt you. If an\naction could have a major impact on your life or your business and\nits eﬀects can’t be reversed, you must decide and not merely\nchoose. In these cases, the magnitude of the potential losses makes\ncareful decision-making a worthwhile investment of your time. In\nthese cases, evaluate the options and decide. Don’t just choose.\nThe next few sections describe some tools for reasoning better\nwhen making decisions. They won’t solve every decision-making\nproblem, because no tool is right for every job; each has its uses\nand limitations. You need multiple tools in your toolbox. Otherwise,\nyou end up solving the wrong problems. As the old adage says, “If\nthe only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem\nas a nail.”\nKnowing how to use these tools depends on keeping your\ndefaults in check so you can reason. If you can’t, you’ll just react\nwith one of your defaults. While you might get the outcomes you\ndesire for a while, it’s only a matter of time before lack of thinking\ncatches up to you. It’s only after you’ve mastered the defaults that\nthe tools I describe become useful.\nIf you can’t keep those in check—if you’re easily swayed by\nemotion, if you can’t adapt to change, if you value being right more\nthan doing what’s best—then all the tools in the world aren’t going to\nhelp you. The defaults will overwhelm you, rout your decision-\nmaking process, and seize control of your life.\n⦁\n\f\nCHAPTER 4.1\nDeﬁne the Problem\nThe ﬁrst principle of decision-making is that the decider needs to\ndeﬁne the problem.[*] If you’re not the one making the decision,\nyou can suggest the problem that needs to be solved, but you don’t\nget to deﬁne it. Only the person responsible for the outcome does.\nThe decision-maker can take input from anywhere—bosses,\nsubordinates, colleagues, experts, etc. However, the responsibility\nto get to the bottom of the problem—to sort fact from opinion and\ndetermine what’s really happening—rests with them.\nDeﬁning the problem starts with identifying two things: (1) what\nyou want to achieve, and (2) what obstacles stand in the way of\ngetting it.\nUnfortunately, people too often end up solving the wrong\nproblem.\nPerhaps you can relate to this scenario, which I’ve seen\nthousands of times over the years. A decision-maker assembles a\ndiverse team to solve a critical and time-sensitive problem. There\nare ten people in the room all giving input about what’s happening\n—each from a diﬀerent perspective. Within a few minutes someone\nannounces what they think the problem is, the room goes silent for\na microsecond . . . and then everyone starts discussing possible\nsolutions.\nOften the ﬁrst plausible description of the situation deﬁnes the\nproblem that the team will try to solve.[*] Once the group comes up\nwith a solution, the decision-maker feels good. That person then\nallocates resources toward the idea and expects the problem to be\nsolved. But it isn’t. Because the ﬁrst lens into an issue rarely reveals\nwhat the real problem is, so the real problem doesn’t get solved.\n\f\nWhat’s happening here?\nThe social default prompts us to accept the ﬁrst deﬁnition people\nagree on and move forward. Once someone states a problem, the\nteam shifts into “solution” mode without considering whether the\nproblem has even been correctly deﬁned. This is what happens\nwhen you put a bunch of smart, type A people together and tell\nthem to solve a problem. Most of the time, they end up missing the\nreal problem and merely addressing a symptom of it. They react\nwithout reasoning.\nMany of us have been taught that solving problems is how we\nadd value. In school, teachers give us problems to solve, and at\nwork our bosses do the same. We’ve been taught our whole lives to\nsolve problems.\nBut when it comes to deﬁning problems, we have less\nexperience. Things are often uncertain. We seldom have all the\ninformation. Sometimes, there are competing ideas about what the\nproblem is, competing proposals to solve it, and then lots of\ninterpersonal friction. So we’re much less comfortable deﬁning\nproblems than solving them, and the social default uses that\ndiscomfort. It encourages us to react instead of reason, in order to\nprove we’re adding value. Just solve a problem—any problem!\nThe result: organizations and individuals waste a lot of time\nsolving the wrong problems. It’s so much easier to treat the\nsymptoms than ﬁnd the underlying disease, to put out ﬁres rather\nthan prevent them, or to simply punt things into the future. The\nproblem with this approach is that the ﬁres never burn out, they\nﬂare up repeatedly. And when you punt something into the future,\nthe future eventually arrives.\nWe’re busier than ever at work, but most of the time what we’re\nbusy doing is putting out ﬁres—ﬁres that started with a poor initial\ndecision made years earlier, which should’ve been prevented in the\nﬁrst place.\nAnd because there are so many ﬁres and so many demands on\nour time, we tend to focus on just putting out the ﬂames. Yet as any\nexperienced camper knows, putting out ﬂames doesn’t put out the\nﬁre. Since all our time is spent running around and putting out the\nﬂames, we have no time to think about today’s problems, which can"

    "raw_text": "create the kindling for tomorrow’s ﬁres.\nThe best decision-makers know that the way we deﬁne a\nproblem shapes everyone’s perspective about it and determines the\nsolutions. The most critical step in any decision-making process is\nto get the problem right. This part of the process oﬀers invaluable\ninsight. Since you can’t solve a problem you don’t understand,\ndeﬁning the problem is a chance to take in lots of relevant\ninformation. Only by talking to the experts, seeking the opinions of\nothers, hearing their diﬀerent perspectives, and sorting out what’s\nreal from what’s not can the decision-maker understand the real\nproblem.\nWhen you really understand a problem, the solution seems\nobvious. Later, we’ll talk about the tells that reveal when people are\nsolving a problem they don’t fully understand.\nThese two principles follow the example of the best decision-\nmakers:\nthe deﬁnition principle: Take responsibility for deﬁning the problem.\nDon’t let someone deﬁne it for you. Do the work to understand it. Don’t use\njargon to describe or explain it.\nthe root cause principle: Identify the root cause of the problem. Don’t be\ncontent with simply treating its symptoms.\nI once took over a department where the software would regularly\nfreeze. Solving the problem required physically rebooting the\nserver. (The drawback of working in a top secret facility was our\nlack of connectivity to the outside world.)\nAlmost every weekend, one of the people on my team would be\ncalled into work to ﬁx the problem. Without fail, he’d have the\nsystem back up and running quickly. The outage was small, the\nimpact minimal. Problem solved. Or was it?\nAt the end of the ﬁrst month, I received the overtime bill to sign.\nThose weekend visits were costing a small fortune. We were\naddressing the symptom without solving the problem. Fixing the\nreal problem required a few weeks of work, instead of a few\nminutes on the weekend. No one wanted to solve the real problem\n\f\nbecause it was painful. So we just kept putting out ﬂames and\nletting the ﬁre reignite.\nA handy tool for identifying the root cause of a problem is to ask\nyourself, “What would have to be true for this problem not to exist\nin the ﬁrst place?” Here’s another example of this tool put to use:\nThe ASPCA is one of the largest animal-welfare groups in the\nUnited States. It estimates that more than 3 million dogs enter\nshelters each year and are put up for adoption. Roughly 1.4 million\nof them are successfully adopted, but that leaves more than 1\nmillion unadopted dogs in the US each year.[*]\nThere are only so many people willing to adopt a pet, and only\nso many pets a given family can handle, so the question facing most\nshelters is, “How can we get more people to adopt?” But answering\nthat question doesn’t make any progress toward a long-term\nsolution.\nOne shelter took a diﬀerent approach. The founder of Downtown\nDog Rescue in Los Angeles, Lori Weise, asked instead, “What would\nhave to be true for there to be fewer dogs to adopt in the ﬁrst\nplace?”[1] Weise dug into the data and found that 30 percent of\ndogs entering a shelter were owner surrenders—pets voluntarily\ngiven up by their owners. She found that many times caring owners\nsurrendered their pets because they couldn’t aﬀord to feed them\nand thought someone else could better care for the animal. With\nthis insight, a better and more permanent solution became\napparent.\nWeise started a new program: Whenever a family came in to\nsurrender a pet, the staﬀ asked if they would prefer to keep the pet.\nIf the answer was yes, the staﬀ used their network to help resolve\nthe problem—whether it was just a matter of a ten-dollar rabies\nshot, or long-term access to pet food. Weise and her team found\nthat it was actually cheaper to help a family feed and keep a pet\nthan to house it at the shelter. More important, the program\nenabled 75 percent of the families who came in intending to\nsurrender pets to keep them permanently instead.\nIdentifying the root cause of a problem applies in business too. A\ncompany might think that its problem is getting too few new sales,\nso it marshals resources to get new leads. But what if getting new\n\f\nsales isn’t the root of the problem? What if there’s an issue with,\nsay, the product itself? The root cause of any problem like this is\ncustomer satisfaction, and that’s not necessarily the same as getting\nnew customers. It could also be keeping existing customers happy.\nThe way you deﬁne a problem changes what you see.\nYour defaults are always present, and despite your eﬀorts to\nfollow the Deﬁnition Principle and the Root Cause Principle, it’s\nstill possible to get sidetracked.\nHow to Safeguard the Problem-Deﬁning Stage\nThere are two ways to safeguard this stage of the decision process\nagainst our defaults: create a ﬁrewall and use time to your\nadvantage.\nsafeguard: Build a problem-solution ﬁrewall. Separate the problem-deﬁning\nphase of the decision-making process from the problem-solving phase.\nA mentor of mine once taught me that the best way to avoid ﬁnding\nthe perfect solution to the wrong problem at work, when time\nallows, is to hold two separate meetings: one to deﬁne the problem,\nand one to come up with the solution.\nThe most precious resources in any organization are time and\nthe brainpower of your best employees. Asking for two separate\nmeetings to come up with a solution to a problem that seemed\nobvious to everyone is not an easy sell. But it’s worth it. I’ve used\nthis safeguard for many years, and I’ve seen it used over and over\nby people who consistently make good decisions. As soon as they\nstart implementing it, they learn that having a single meeting for\nboth tasks only makes them vulnerable to the social default—either\ntheir action-oriented teams will likely spend only a moment or two\ndeﬁning the problem and the rest of the meeting trying to solve it,\nor everyone will start suggesting solutions to their version of the\nproblem. Either way the meeting won’t be as useful as it should be.\nWhen you spend time trying to understand the problem, you\nrealize that you have a room full of people who have insight that\n\f\nyou don’t have. One way to keep meetings short and avoid the\nsignaling that comes from repeating information that everyone\nknows is simply asking everyone, “What do you know about this\nproblem that other people in the room don’t know?”\nThat question makes people think. They stop ﬁlling the air with\nideas everyone already knows and start explaining how they think\nabout the problem.\nNot only do you start learning from each other, but you come to\nunderstand the problem at a deeper level because you start to see\n(and hopefully appreciate) diﬀerent perspectives. Later, when you\nreconvene at the second meeting, the solutions often become\nobvious to everyone. And because everyone understands the\nproblem, each person knows how to move their part of the\norganization in a way that solves it for everyone, not just\nthemselves. An apocryphal quote often attributed to the philosopher\nLudwig Wittgenstein sums up this idea: “To understand is to know\nwhat to do.”[*]\nPeople go fast in operational environments. If you insert too\nmuch process into decisions, you miss the expiring windows of\nopportunity. But fast-paced environments are a feast for defaults.\nYou need to slow down—but not too much—and use a combination\nof judgment, principles, and safeguards to make sure you’re getting\nto the best answer possible and thinking clearly. Probing and asking\ndeeper questions slows down the process just enough to\ndramatically improve your chances of solving the right problem.\nCreating space between the deﬁnition of a problem and the\nsolution to it works at a personal level too. Give yourself time to get\nclear on what the problem is before you jump into solving it. More\noften than not, you’ll discover that your ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne the\nunderlying issue is rarely the most accurate.\ntip: Remember that writing out the problem makes the invisible visible. Write\ndown what you think the problem is, and then look at it the next day. If you\nﬁnd yourself using jargon in your description, it’s a sign that you don’t fully\nunderstand the problem. And if you don’t understand it, you shouldn’t be\nmaking a decision about it.\n\f\nLet’s move on to the second way of safeguarding this stage of the\ndecision-making process.\nsafeguard: Use the test of time. Test whether you’re addressing the root\ncause of a problem, rather than merely treating a symptom, by asking\nyourself whether it will stand the test of time. Will this solution ﬁx the problem\npermanently, or will the problem return in the future? If it seems like the latter,\nthen chances are you’re only treating a symptom.\nSuppose, for example, that Downtown Dog Rescue in Los Angeles\nhad tried to solve its problem with overcrowding by hosting a\nspring dog-adoption campaign, rather than addressing one of the\nroot causes: pet owners’ inability to continue caring for their dogs.\nThe campaign might have succeeded in reducing the number of\ndogs the rescue housed at the time, but only temporarily. A few\nmonths later, the facility would have once again been overcrowded.\nShort-term solutions might make sense in the moment, but they\nnever win in the long term. You feel like you’re moving forward\nwhen you’re actually just going in circles. People gravitate toward\nthem because ﬁnding a short-term ﬁx signals to others that they’re\ndoing something. That’s the social default at work. It fools people\ninto mistaking action for progress, the loudest voice for the right\none, and conﬁdence for competence. Time eventually reveals short-\nterm solutions to be Band-Aids that cover deeper problems. Don’t\nbe fooled!\nYou can put your energy into short-term solutions or long-term\nsolutions but not both. Any energy that’s channeled toward short-\nterm solutions depletes energy that could be put into ﬁnding a long-\nterm ﬁx.[2] Sometimes short-term solutions are necessary to create\nspace for long-term solutions. Just make sure you’re not putting out\nﬂames in the present that will reignite in the future. When the same\nproblem returns again and again, people end up exhausted and\ndiscouraged because they never seem to make real progress.\nExtinguish the ﬁre today so it can’t burn you tomorrow.\nThese principles, safeguards, and tips will keep you from\njumping at the social default’s whim."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 4.2\nExplore Possible Solutions\nOnce you’re clear on the problem, it’s time to think of possible\nsolutions—ways of overcoming the obstacles to get what you want.\nThe way to come up with possible solutions is by imagining\ndiﬀerent possible futures—diﬀerent ways the world could turn out.\nOne of the most common errors at this stage of the decision-\nmaking process is avoiding the brutal realities.\nIn his book Good to Great, author Jim Collins tells the story of his\ninterview with Admiral James Stockdale. During the Vietnam War,\nStockdale was the highest-ranking US military oﬃcer at the\nnotorious Hỏa Lò prisoner of war camp (sarcastically dubbed the\n“Hanoi Hilton”). He was tortured over twenty times during an\neight-year imprisonment and given no release date, no prisoner\nrights, and no certainty whether he would survive to see his family\nagain.\nWhen Collins asked Stockdale about his fellow prisoners who\ndidn’t survive the camp, the admiral singled out the optimists. “Oh,\nthey were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by Christmas.’\nAnd Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they’d\nsay, ‘We’re going to be out by Easter.’ And Easter would come, and\nEaster would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be\nChristmas again. And they died of a broken heart.”\nAfter a long pause, he turned to Collins and said, “This is a very\nimportant lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail\nin the end—which you can never aﬀord to lose—with the discipline\nto confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever\nthey might be.”[1]\nCollins called this combination of faith in prevailing with the\n\f\ndiscipline to confront brutal facts the Stockdale Paradox. He says he\nstill carries with him the mental image of Stockdale admonishing\nthe optimists: “We’re not getting out by Christmas; deal with it!”\nProblems Don’t Disappear by Themselves\nWe all face diﬃcult problems. The defaults narrow our perspective.\nThey narrow our view of the world and tempt us to see things as we\nwish them to be, not as they are. Only by dealing with reality—the\noften-brutal truth of how the world really works—can we secure the\noutcomes we want.\nThe worst thing we can do with a diﬃcult problem is resort to\nmagical thinking—putting our heads in the sand and hoping the\nproblem will disappear on its own or that a solution will present\nitself to us.\nThe future is not like the weather. It doesn’t just happen to us.\nWe shape our future with the choices we make in the present, just\nas our present situation was shaped by choices we made in the past.\nWherever we are now is a reﬂection of the past choices and\nbehaviors that got us here. If we’re in a happy relationship, we can\nlook back and see the years of eﬀort, communication, negotiation,\nluck, and (possibly) therapy that got us to this point. If we wake up\nbleary-eyed and muddleheaded, we can see how excessive drinking\nthe night before disrupted our sleep. If we’re operating a successful\nbusiness, we can see how running lean at the right times, or\nperhaps doubling down when things weren’t so certain, contributed\nto our current success.\nIf only we had the beneﬁt of hindsight for the decisions we make\ntoday—if only we could see the present with the insight and clarity\nwe have about the past! The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard once\nsaid, “Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived\nforwards.”\nLuckily, there’s a way to convert the hindsight of tomorrow into\nthe foresight of today. It’s a thought experiment that psychologists\ncall premortem. The concept isn’t new, it originates in Stoic\nphilosophy. Seneca used premeditatio malorum (“the premeditation\nof evils”) to prepare for the inevitable ups and downs of life. The\n\f\npoint isn’t to worry about problems; it’s to fortify and prepare for\nthem.\nThe hardest setbacks to deal with are the ones we’re not\nprepared for and don’t expect. That’s why you need to anticipate\nthem before they happen and act now in order to avoid them.\nMany people think they’re bad problem solvers when in fact\nthey’re bad problem anticipators. Most of us don’t want to think\nabout more problems; we have enough already. We think that\nbefore bad things happen, we’ll get a warning, we’ll have time to\nprepare, we’ll be ready. But the world doesn’t work that way.\nBad things happen to good people all the time. We get laid oﬀ\nwithout warning. We get into a car accident. Our boss comes into\nour oﬃce and lays into us. A pandemic spreads throughout the\nworld. No warnings. No time to prepare.\nPerforming a premortem might not save you from every disaster,\nbut you’ll be surprised by how many it can save you from. Here’s\nhow it works.\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\nImagining what could go wrong doesn’t make you pessimistic. It\nmakes you prepared. If you haven’t thought about the things that\ncould go wrong, you will be at the mercy of circumstances. Fear,\nanger, panic—when emotion consumes you, reason leaves you. You\njust react.\nThe antidote is this principle:\nthe bad outcome principle: Don’t just imagine the ideal future outcome.\nImagine the things that could go wrong and how you’ll overcome them if they\ndo.\nIf you’ve got a presentation to the board next week, imagine all the\nways it could go wrong: What if technology fails? What if they can’t\nﬁnd the presentation? What if the audience isn’t engaged?\nLeave nothing out of consideration. Nothing should surprise you.\nAs Seneca said, “We need to envisage every possibility and . . .\n\f\nstrengthen the spirit to deal with the things which may conceivably\ncome about.”[2]\nWhen bad things happen, there is no two-minute warning where\nyou get a commercial break to prepare. You have to deal with it as\nit happens. The best decision-makers know that bad things happen,\nand that they’re not immune. They don’t just wing it and react.\nThey anticipate and make contingency plans. And because they’re\nready, their conﬁdence doesn’t crack. The venture capitalist Josh\nWolfe likes to say, “Failure comes from a failure to imagine\nfailure.”[3]\nThe bottom line: people who think about what’s likely to go\nwrong and determine the actions they can take are more likely to\nsucceed when things don’t go according to plan.\nA smart way to assess your options is by using the following\nprinciple.\nthe second-level thinking principle: Ask yourself, “And then what?”\nWhen you solve a problem, you make a change in the world. That\nchange can be either in line with your long-term objectives or not.\nFor example, if you’re hungry and you eat a chocolate bar, you’ve\nsolved the immediate hunger problem, but that solution has\nconsequences: the inevitable sugar crash an hour or two later. If\nyour longer-term goal is to be productive that afternoon, the\nchocolate bar is not the best solution to your immediate problem.\nIt’s true that eating a chocolate bar once won’t ruin your diet or\nyour day. But repeating that seemingly small error in judgment\ndaily over the course of your lifetime will not put you in a position\nfor success. Tiny choices compound. That’s why second-level\nthinking is needed.\nSecond-Level Thinking\nInside us all, there is a competition between our today self and our\nfuture self.[*] Our future self often wants us to make diﬀerent\nchoices than our today self wants to make. While today you cares\n\f\nabout winning the present moment, future you cares about winning\nthe generation. Each of these personalities oﬀers a diﬀerent\nperspective on problems. Our future self sees the beneﬁts or\nconsequences of the accumulation of our seemingly insigniﬁcant\nchoices.\nYou can think of ﬁrst-level thinking as your today self and\nsecond-level thinking as your future self.\nFirst-level thinking looks to solve the immediate problem\nwithout regard to any future problems a solution might produce.\nSecond-level thinking looks at the problem from beginning to end.\nIt looks past the immediate solution and asks, “And then what?”[*]\nThe chocolate bar doesn’t seem so tempting when you answer this\nquestion.\nYou can’t solve a problem optimally unless you consider not just\nwhether it meets your short-term objectives but whether it meets\nyour long-term objectives as well. A failure to think of second-order\nconsequences leads us unknowingly to make bad decisions. You\ncan’t ensure the future is easier if you only think about solving the\ncurrent problem and don’t give due consideration to the problems\ncreated in the process. This idea is evident when looking back at the\nUS war in Afghanistan.\nAccording to a report issued by the Special Inspector General for\nAfghanistan Reconstruction,\nMany of the institutions and infrastructure projects the United\nStates built were not sustainable. . . . Every mile of road the\nUnited States built and every government employee it trained\nwas thought to serve as a springboard for even more\nimprovements and to enable the reconstruction eﬀort to\neventually end. However, the U.S. government often failed to\nensure its projects were sustainable over the long term.\nBillions of reconstruction dollars were wasted as projects\nwent unused or fell into disrepair. Demands to make fast\nprogress incentivized U.S. oﬃcials to identify and implement\nshort-term projects with little consideration for host\ngovernment capacity and long-term sustainability.[4]\n\f\nBy contrast, here’s an example of the Second-Level Thinking\nPrinciple in action. My friend’s client—call her Maria—is a mostly\nself-taught data scientist.[*] She worked her way up through the\nstartup world and became a reasonably successful executive at a\ntech company, where she spent ﬁve years. Her position recently\ndisappeared overnight, when the company went under.\nHer goals are to continue earning an executive’s salary (around\n$180k per year) while working from home and having a schedule\nthat allows her to be present for her family. Ideally, she wants to\nwork for a company committed to social responsibility. She has\n$100k in the bank, and wants to have a job within two years, but\ncan wait as long as four. She currently has two job oﬀers for less\nmoney than she wants, and neither job excites her very much.

Maria’s options\ninclude:\n•  Going back to school for a master’s degree\n•  Accepting one of the full-time positions she’s been oﬀered at\n$90k per year\n•  Doing some consulting work\n•  Continuing to look for other full-time opportunities\nNext, consider the immediate outcomes of these options:\n•  If Maria goes back to school, it could mean thirty-plus hours a\nweek doing school-related things. That would mean less time to\ndedicate to paid work or her family.\n•  If she accepts one of the full-time positions she’s been\noﬀered, she would be making money and be able to pay her\nbills. It would be far less than she wants, but she could\ncompensate by tightening her budget and saving more for\nretirement.\n•  If she does consulting work, there are a lot of unknowns. She"

We must consider\nthe outcomes of those outcomes, the answer to the question, “And\nthen what?”\nLet’s apply the Bad Outcome Principle as we go through the\noptions, thinking not just about the case in which everything goes\nwell, but also the case in which things go poorly.\nMaria goes back to school:\n•  If it goes well: She gets a scholarship, develops a great\nnetwork, gains skills, and opens up a lot of opportunities for\nherself.

    "raw_text": "Maria’s example illustrates an important point about second-level\nthinking: it not only helps us avoid future problems, it also\nuncovers information we need to make a better decision—\ninformation we didn’t know we needed before. It’s easy to sit back\nand think the right information will ﬁnd you. It won’t!\nHow to Safeguard the Solution-Exploring Stage\nJust because you’ve thought of a couple solutions, though, doesn’t\nmean you’ve eliminated your blind spots. Binary thinking is when\nyou consider only two options to a problem. When you ﬁrst look at\nthe choice, it seems simple: We launch the product or we don’t. We\ntake the new job or we don’t. We get married or we don’t. It’s black\nand white: “do” or “do not.” There isn’t any middle ground.\nMost of the time, though, this type of thinking is limiting. Some\ndecisions might seem to come down to a choice between this or\nthat, but there’s often another option. The best decision-makers\nknow this, and see binary thinking as a sign that we don’t fully\nunderstand a problem—that we’re trying to reduce the problem’s\ndimensions before fully understanding them.\nWhen we start exploring a problem in detail, things become\nmore complicated before we understand it well enough to see the\nalternatives.\nProblem-solving novices try to reduce a decision to just two\noptions because it creates the false sense that they’ve gotten to the\nproblem’s essence. In reality, they’ve just stopped thinking. And you\nnever want to stop thinking! Novices fail to see the complexities of\na problem that are apparent to a master. Masters see the simplicity\nhiding in the complexity. As Frederic Maitland purportedly once\nwrote, “Simplicity is the end result of long, hard work, not the\nstarting point.” When we reduce the problem to black-and-white\nsolutions, we need to check to make sure we’re the master and not\nthe novice.\nThis brings us to the next principle of eﬀective problem-solving:\nthe 3+ principle: Force yourself to explore at least three possible solutions\n\f\nto a problem. If you ﬁnd yourself considering only two options, force yourself\nto ﬁnd at least one more.\nBinary framing is as comfortable as it is passive. Doing the work to\nadd a third option forces us to be creative and really dig into the\nproblem. Even if we don’t choose the third option, forcing ourselves\nto develop it helps us understand the problem better. It gives us\nmore opportunities to align our decisions with our goals, oﬀers\nmore optionality in the future, and increases the chances that we’ll\nbe happier with our decision down the road.\nThere are two safeguards against binary thinking. The ﬁrst is\nthis:\nsafeguard: Imagine that one of the options is oﬀ the table. Take each of the\noptions you’re considering, and one at a time, ask yourself, “What would I do\nif that were not possible?”\nSuppose you’re considering what to do about a job where you don’t\nget along with a coworker. Binary thinking tells you to stay or\nleave. Imagining that one option is oﬀ the table forces you to see\nthe problem diﬀerently. Imagine that, for some reason, there is\nabsolutely no way to quit your job: You must stay. Now you are\nforced to see things through a new lens. What could you do to make\ngoing to work every day more enjoyable, despite the problem with\nyour coworker? What could you do to remain at your job and still\nmove closer to your goals? What could you do to give yourself more\noptions in the future so you’re not stuck feeling powerless? Maybe\nstaying means having a hard conversation with your boss and your\ncoworker that you haven’t had yet. Maybe it means putting in for a\ntransfer to another department. Maybe it means asking your boss if\nyou can work remotely.\nNow try looking at this situation the other way. Imagine that, for\nsome reason, there is absolutely no way you can stay at your job:\nYou have to leave. What would you do? Would you call up old\nclients and see if they need help? Would you get hold of people in\nyour network to see if they could make an introduction at their\n\f\ncompany? Would you pursue every possibility until you found\nyourself in a better position?\nSometimes we can’t do what we want when we want, like\nleaving a job that’s become diﬃcult to endure. But that doesn’t\nmean we’re stuck. We can always do something to move forward,\nputting ourselves in a better position to get more of what we want\nand less of what we don’t. If we can’t leave our job, we can at least\nimprove it. If we can’t stay, we can prepare to leave. Reframing the\nproblem shows us the next step.\nRemember: Limiting ourselves to binary thinking before fully\nunderstanding a problem is a dangerous simpliﬁcation that creates\nblind spots. False dualities prevent you from seeing alternative\npaths and other information that might change your mind. On the\nother hand, taking away one of two clear options forces you to\nreframe the problem and get unstuck.\nHere’s the second safeguard against binary thinking:\nsafeguard: Come up with Both-And options. Try to ﬁnd ways of combining\nthe binary. Think not in terms of choosing either X or Y, but rather having\nboth X and Y.\nRoger Martin, former dean of the Rotman School of Management in\nToronto, refers to this technique as integrative thinking.[5] Rather\nthan grappling with seemingly opposed binary options, combine\nthem. Simplistic Either-Or options become integrative Both-And\noptions. You can keep costs down and invest in a better customer\nexperience. You can stay at your job and start a side hustle. You can\ndeliver for your shareholders and protect the environment.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald once said, “The test of a ﬁrst-rate intelligence\nis the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same\ntime, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for\nexample, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be\ndetermined to make them otherwise.”\nUnlike Fitzgerald, though, I don’t think you need to have ﬁrst-\nrate intelligence to come up with Both-And options. The capacity\nfor combinatorial solutions isn’t reserved for the gifted. It’s a skill\n\f\nthat can be learned and used; it’s just a skill that goes untaught. The\nkey is learning to live with the uncomfortable tension between\nopposing ideas long enough to see that there’s a solution that\ncombines the best elements of both. And that’s what integrative\nthinking is all about.\nIt can be challenging to think this way, yet it’s almost always\npossible. One area where we tend to be pretty good at integrative\nthinking is vacation planning. We ask everyone involved what they\nwant to do, and then try to ﬁnd a place that has it all. This is why\nresorts or cruises oﬀer a long list of activities: the more variety, the\nmore attractive they are to groups with diverse interests. Guests in\nsuch places rarely face a hard choice between, say, the beach or the\npool. They can have both.\nYou can apply the same thinking to other areas of your life,\nincluding your career. The solution to an unfulﬁlling job is rarely\njust one option in the stay-or-go binary, even if it seems that way at\nﬁrst. You can both stay and begin reaching out to your network. You\ncan both apply for jobs and go to school in the evenings to acquire a\nnew skill. You can both start a creative project and do more at your\ncurrent job to give you the creative outlet you need.\nRoger Martin put it this way: “Thinkers who exploit opposing\nideas to construct a new solution enjoy a built-in advantage over\nthinkers who can consider only one model at a time.” He’s right.\nNot only do integrative thinkers build an advantage, they also tend\nto capture exponential upside because they break free of traditional\nways of thinking.\nConsider Isadore Sharp, who created the luxurious Four Seasons\nhotel chain. Sharp’s ﬁrst property was a small roadside hotel in the\nToronto suburbs. His second was a large convention hotel in the\nheart of the city. Each property represented one of the conventional\noperating models of the time: either going small and focusing on\npersonal service or going large and focusing on amenities. The hotel\nindustry was stuck in binary thinking. Rather than choose between\nthem, though, Sharp combined the intimacy of a small hotel with\nthe amenities of a large one. In the process he created a new way of\noperating and one of the most successful hotel chains of all time.\nOur personal lives also beneﬁt from Both-And thinking. For\n\f\nexample, we often expect our partners to fulﬁll 100 percent of our\nemotional needs. That’s a lot to ask of anyone, and many of us\nexperience relationship challenges when disappointments inevitably\nresult. But instead of asking, “Should I stay or leave?” ask instead,\n“Is there anyone else that could meet some of the emotional needs\nthat my partner can’t? Is there a colleague that I could vent to at\nwork? Do I have a friend who shares this interest or who will take\nthis class with me?”\nWhen we think of adding people to our lives, we start to open up\nBoth-And options for ourselves. So instead of the usual relationship\nbinary, “Should I stay or leave?” we start to say, “Whom else can I\ninclude in my life to help with everything beyond what my partner\ndoes well?”\nWe don’t need a lot of additional options, just a few really good\nones. When you hear yourself say, “Either X or Y,” it means you’re\nentering the narrow pathway between a rock and a hard place—a\nbinary decision. Digging in and forcing yourself to add credible\nalternative options allows you to see solutions you may not have\nconsidered before.\nOpportunity Costs\nThinking better isn’t about ﬁlling your brain with answers to\nquestions you’ve seen before. It’s not about memorizing what to do\nand when. It’s not about letting other people think for you either.\nIt’s about looking beyond the things that are obvious and seeing the\nthings that are hidden from view.\nThe real world is full of trade-oﬀs, some of which are obvious,\nand others that are hidden. Opportunity costs are the hidden trade-\noﬀs that decision-makers often have trouble assessing. Every\ndecision has at least one of them. Because we can’t always do\neverything we want, picking one thing usually means forgoing\nanother. The ability to size up hidden trade-oﬀs is part of what\nseparates great decision-makers from the rest. It’s also a core\nelement of leadership.\nCharlie Munger put it this way: “Intelligent people make\ndecisions based on opportunity costs . . . it’s your alternatives that\n\f\nmatter. That’s how we make all of our decisions.”[6]\nImproving our thinking isn’t just about having the answers to\nquestions we’ve encountered before. It’s not about memorizing a set\nof predetermined actions. It’s not about relying on others to do the\nthinking for us. It’s about delving deeper, beyond the surface level,\nand uncovering what lies hidden from our view.\nMany people focus solely on what they stand to gain by choosing\nan option and forget to factor in what they stand to lose by forgoing\nanother. But the ability to size up these costs is one of the things\nthat separates great decision-makers from the rest.\nOne of my favorite examples of this is a story about Andrew\nCarnegie. When Carnegie was young and relatively inexperienced in\nhis job at the Pennsylvania Railroad, there was a bad train wreck\nthat left train cars strewn across the tracks and gridlocked the entire\nsystem. Carnegie’s boss was absent, so Carnegie himself had to\ndecide how to handle the event. Cleaning up the cars would save\nmuch of the cargo, but it would be a long and costly operation and\nwould suspend all train traﬃc for days. Carnegie realized that a\nmultiday system-wide shutdown wasn’t worth the cost of the cargo\nand the cars. He sent a bold note signed in his boss’s name: “Burn\nthe cars!” When Carnegie’s boss learned of his choice, he instantly\nmade it the routine method of dealing with similar emergencies in\nthe future.[7]\nThinking through opportunity costs is one of the most eﬀective\nthings you can do in business and in life. The optimal way of\nexploring your options is to take all the relevant factors into\naccount. You can’t do this without considering opportunity costs.\nThere are two principles concerning opportunity costs. The ﬁrst\nis this:\nthe opportunity-cost principle: Consider what opportunities you’re\nforgoing when you choose one option over another.\nThe second principle is closely related:\n\f\nthe 3-lens principle: View opportunity costs through these three lenses:\n(1) Compared with what? (2) And then what? (3) At the expense of what?[*]\nFor most of us, the ﬁrst lens is our default because the costs are\ndirect and visible. For instance, think about purchasing a car. If\nyou’re like most people, you can narrow the decision down to a few\noptions pretty quickly: “The Tesla will look extra cool and be fuel\neﬃcient, but will it be good for road trips? A BMW looks great and\nhas more cargo space, but is a gas-powered vehicle behind the\ncurve? Should I get the car that’s $42,000 or $37,000?” When we\ncompare the two models, we focus on what the additional $5,000\ngets us in terms of features, and forget to view the choice through\nthe other two lenses.\nWhen we view the choice through the second lens, we consider\nthe additional costs that will arise after we’ve selected an option—\nfor example, how we’ll need to charge the Tesla, its anticipated\nyearly operating costs, its durability, and how many long drives\nwe’ll go on annually. When we view the choice through the third\nlens, we consider what else we could do with that $5,000. Are we\ngiving up a family vacation? What about the dividends we could get\nif we invested it? What about the savings if we pay down the\nmortgage? What about a rainy-day fund in case we lose our job?\nLooking through all three lenses helps us make a better decision.\nMoney is not the only opportunity cost to consider. It’s just the\nmost direct and visible, and for that reason people tend to focus on\nit. They convince themselves that what’s easy to see is all that\nmatters. But in many cases, the real value to thinking through\nopportunity costs is to understand the indirect hidden costs.\nTime is not as easy to see as money but it’s just as important.\nSuppose your family is growing, and it’s time to move. Relocating\nto the suburbs will get you a bigger house with a bigger yard for the\nkids, and it’ll be cheaper than buying a smaller duplex downtown\nwith a backyard the size of a postage stamp. In this situation, many\npeople think of how much money they’ll save by moving to the\nsuburbs, and get caught up in the happy thought of walking across\nthe threshold of their new home for the ﬁrst time. But this way of\nthinking views the situation through only the ﬁrst lens. It doesn’t\n\f\ndisclose the less obvious costs of living in the suburbs. When we\napply the other two lenses, we start seeing those costs more clearly.\nLet’s apply the second lens. Suppose you buy that house in the\nsuburbs. Ask yourself, “And then what?” How will your\ncircumstances change if you choose that option? For one thing,\nyour commute might be diﬀerent. Perhaps it goes from a\npredictable half hour each way to an unpredictable hour and a half.\nNow apply the third lens. Ask yourself, “At the expense of\nwhat?” What are you not going to be able to do because you’re\nspending an extra two to three hours a day in transit? Will you\nspend less time with your kids and your partner? What will you\nmiss out on by not being with them? Will you be able to spend the\ncommute learning a new language or reading some great literature,\nor will you have to deal with the frustration and stress of driving?\nOver time, which option is better for your mental and physical\nhealth?\ntip: If you’re having trouble assessing opportunity costs, it sometimes helps\nto put a price on them. For example, putting a price on those extra two to\nthree hours a day spent commuting will make them more visible and easier to\nassess.\nKeep in mind, though, that pricing things whose costs are diﬃcult\nto assess is just a tool. Like any tool, it’s useful for some jobs, but\nnot useful for all. It’s an attempt to make the invisible visible.\nSometimes there are important factors that you simply can’t put a\nprice on without grossly distorting the trade-oﬀs. As Einstein is\nthought to have said, “Not everything that can be counted counts,\nand not everything that counts can be counted.” We’ll see later on\nthat assessing these “priceless” factors is something that the wisest\ndecision-makers have mastered."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 4.3\nEvaluate the Options\nYou’ve worked out some potential solutions in detail. Each suggests\na course of action that might work. You now need to evaluate the\noptions and pick the one most likely to make the future easier.\nThere are two components here: (1) your criteria for evaluating the\noptions and (2) how you apply them.\nEach problem has its own speciﬁc criteria. Some of the more\ncommon ones include opportunity cost, return on investment (ROI),\nand likelihood of the desired outcome, but there are many others.\nWhen you understand the problem, the criteria should be apparent.\nRecently I undertook a renovation. Some of my criteria included\nexperience of the crew, availability, demonstrated pace on past\nprojects, and quality of craftmanship.\nIf you ﬁnd yourself struggling to determine speciﬁc criteria, it’s a\nsign either that you don’t really understand the problem, or that\nyou don’t understand the general features that criteria are supposed\nto have. Those features include the following:\nClarity: The criteria should be simple, clear, and free of any\njargon. Ideally, you should be able to explain them to a\ntwelve-year-old.\nGoal promotion: The criteria must favor only those options that\nachieve the desired goal.\nDecisiveness: The criteria must favor exactly one option; they\ncan’t result in a tie among several.\nCriteria that fail to satisfy these conditions often lead to decision-\n\f\nmaking errors. When criteria are too complicated, people have\ntrouble knowing how to apply them. When they are ambiguous,\npeople have a green light to interpret them in whichever way suits\nthem. As a result, people end up applying criteria in diﬀerent ways\nbased on what they want or how they feel at the moment. Their\ndecision-making process becomes a playground for the emotion\ndefault.\nWhen deciding at work, criteria that are ambiguous or jargon-\nladen lend themselves to endless debates as to their meaning. We\nassume that everyone has a shared understanding of what these\nwords and phrases mean. They don’t. We assume that our own\ndeﬁnitions won’t change. They might. What a word like “strategic”\nmeans to one person is often diﬀerent from what it means to\nanother. As a result, ambiguous criteria rob decision-makers of their\nability to distinguish who’s right from who’s wrong, and force\ndebates about semantics instead of which potential solution is the\nbest.\nOther times the criteria don’t promote the goal. This is often the\nsocial default’s doing. One common example is when leaders make\ndecisions about hiring or promotion based not on someone’s\nqualiﬁcations but on their likeable personality. Being nice is not the\nsame as being good at your job. Using niceness as a criterion in\npersonnel decisions frequently doesn’t promote the goals of the\norganization.\nSometimes criteria can promote the wrong goal—steering a team\ntoward what it can do soonest, perhaps, instead of what’s best for\nthe company in the long run. A tragic example happened in January\n1986.\nThe space shuttle Challenger was scheduled to take oﬀ in just a\nfew short weeks. NASA had been trying to establish the space\nshuttle as a reliable way of conducting commercial and scientiﬁc\nmissions in space, and adopted an incredibly ambitious launch\nschedule. NASA had coordinated with President Ronald Reagan to\nlaunch the shuttle the same day as his State of the Union address.\nThe plan was for it to be a spectacular media event, with schools\nacross the country lined up to receive their ﬁrst science lessons\nfrom outer space.\n\f\nBut days before the launch, during a preﬂight meeting, engineers\nfrom Morton Thiokol, a contractor on the Challenger project, were\nshouting and in tears. They knew that the temperatures predicted\nfor the date of the launch were likely too cold for the shuttle’s O-\nrings to function successfully. If the O-rings failed, the result would\nbe catastrophic. They wanted time to ﬁx the problem or wait for\nwarmer launch temperatures, and begged NASA to delay the\nlaunch. Their pleas were rejected. “I am appalled by your\nrecommendation,” one NASA oﬃcial said. “When do you want me\nto launch? Next April?” said another.[1] Most of us who lived\nthrough the ’80s remember what happened next; the Challenger\nexploded seventy-three seconds after taking oﬀ. The criteria for the\nlaunch date decision should obviously have been focused on\npromoting the goal of safety, not speed.\nThe inertia default can also inspire us to adopt criteria that\naren’t goal promoting. For example, upper management might fail\nto see that market conditions have changed. Rather than taking the\ntime to understand the new conditions and adjust their criteria\naccordingly, they continue using the criteria they’ve used in the\npast even though those criteria aren’t goal promoting in the present.\nCriteria can also fail to be decisive. If they don’t help you narrow\nthe options, they’re not useful. Indecisive criteria are another sign\nthat you don’t fully understand the problem and are operating out\nof fear that you’ll be wrong. The social default preys on people who\ndon’t want to take responsibility for outcomes or who don’t have\nclear ideas of what they want.\nThink of choosing a restaurant for dinner with a group of\nfriends. Someone will make an initial suggestion—like eating\nMexican—and inevitably someone else will say, “I just had Mexican\nlast night.” Then you’ll hear, “What about salads?” and someone\nwill say, “I’m too hungry for salad.” On and on ad nauseam: people\nsay what they don’t want until the group is so hungry they pick\nwhatever is most convenient. I’ve seen this situation play out the\nsame way so often it’s comical. (Pay attention the next time it’s\nhappening to you!)\nThe problem here is that in many cases, purely negative criteria\naren’t decisive: they don’t narrow the ﬁeld of options down to one.\n\f\nAs a result, people end up leaving the ultimate choice up to chance\nor circumstance. As the old saying goes, “If you don’t know where\nyou want to go, any road will take you there.”\nSuppose, by contrast, that when you and your friends were\ndeciding where to eat, each of you stated not what you didn’t want\nbut rather what you did:\n•  “I want somewhere that serves salads within ten minutes’\nwalking distance.”\n•  “I want somewhere that serves burgers.”\n•  “I really don’t care; I just want to eat soon.”\nMaking the decision would be much faster, and it would be more\nlikely to get more people what they wanted.\nDeﬁning the Most Important Thing\nNot all criteria are the same. There might be a hundred variables,\nbut they are not equally important. When you’re clear on what’s\nimportant, evaluating options becomes easier. Many people are shy\nto pick out the most important thing because they don’t want to be\nwrong.\nWhen you don’t communicate what’s most important, people are\nleft guessing about what matters. They need you to solve the\nproblem for them. While you feel needed and important, you’re also\nbusy making all the decisions that your colleagues should be\nmaking.\nA lot of managers secretly enjoy being the bottleneck. They like\nthe way it feels when their team is dependent on them. Don’t be\nfooled! This is the ego default at work, and it puts a ceiling on how\nfar you will go. It tries to convince you that you’re the best; that\nyou’re so smart, so skilled, so insightful that only you can make the\ndecisions. In reality, you’re just getting in the way of the team\nperforming at its best.\nI learned this lesson the hard way. I had just taken over a team\nand was surprised that they would check in with me before making\nany decisions—a pattern their previous manager had established.\n\f\nTo speed things up, I came up with a system for them to sort\ndecisions into three boxes:\n1. decisions they could make without any input from me,\n2. decisions they could make after sharing their reasoning with\nme so I could double-check their judgment, and\n3. decisions I wanted to make myself.\nBut the problem persisted.\nAfter a few months, I consulted my mentor. “Do they know what\ndecisions they should make and what decisions you want to make?”\nhe asked. “Are the boxes clear?”\n“Yes,” I replied, “but due to the operational nature of our job, if\nI’m not around, they have to make decisions in the third box\nwithout me. That’s where we’re running into the biggest problems.\nThey seem incapable of doing that.”\n“Do they know the one thing that’s most important?” he probed.\n“I’m not sure what you mean,” I said. “What’s most important\ndiﬀers for each decision.” I listed oﬀ a few diﬀerent types of\ndecisions and how the variables were diﬀerent.\n“That’s not what I mean,” he replied. “Do they know what you\nvalue most?” I hesitated. He looked me square in the eye. “Shane,\ndo you know what you value most?” I stared at him blankly. He\nsighed. “The problem isn’t your team. It’s you. You don’t know\nwhat’s most important. Until you do, your team will never make\ndecisions without you. It’s too risky for them to ﬁgure out the most\nimportant thing. Communicate that to your team, and they’ll be\nable to make decisions on their own.”\n“What if they make the wrong decision?”\n“As long as they make a decision based on the most important\nthing, they won’t be wrong.” He paused, then said slowly, “A lot of\npeople reach their ceiling in this job because they can’t ﬁgure out\nthis one thing.”\nI learned three important lessons that day. First, I couldn’t expect\nmy team to make decisions on their own unless I told them how I\nwanted them to make those decisions. That meant focusing on the\nsingle most important thing and not inundating them with hundreds"

    "raw_text": "of variables to consider. Second, if they made the decision with the\nmost important thing in mind, and it turned out wrong, I couldn’t\nget upset with them. If I did that, they’d never make decisions\nwithout me. The third lesson was perhaps the most revealing: I\nmyself didn’t know what the most important thing was. That’s why\nI couldn’t tell them.\nHow to Safeguard the Evaluation Stage\nThere is only one most important thing in every project, goal, and\ncompany. If you have two or more most important things, you’re\nnot thinking clearly. This is an important aspect of leadership and\nproblem-solving in general: you have to pick one criterion above all\nthe others and communicate it in a way that your people can\nunderstand so they can make decisions on their own. This is true\nleadership. You need to be clear about what values people are to\nuse when making decisions. If I tell you the most important thing is\nserving the customer, you know how to make decisions without me.\nIf you make a bad judgment call, but it puts the customer ﬁrst, I\ncan’t fault you. You did what I wanted.\nBut identifying what’s most important is a skill. It takes practice.\nHere’s how.\nI recommend using sticky notes for this exercise. First, on each\nsticky note, write out one criterion—one thing that’s important to\nyou—in evaluating your options.\nFor example, before I decided to invest in Pixel Union—one of\nthe largest and best design agencies in the Shopify universe—I\nwrote down some criteria that were important to me.\nThey included:\n•  A win-win for employees, customers, and shareholders\n•  Growing rather than shrinking the business\n•  Working with people I trust\n•  Not having to manage people or add more to my plate\n•  Not borrowing money\n•  A high probability of a decent return on investment\n\f\nThere are many more, but you get the idea. Place only one criterion\non each sticky note because next, we’re going to make your criteria\nbattle.\nChoose whichever criterion you think is the most important to\nyou and place it on the wall. Then grab another criterion. Compare\neach and ask, “If I absolutely had to choose between only these two,\nwhich matters more?”\nSo to return to my example of investing in Pixel Union, the ﬁrst\nbattle might be this: earning a return on investment versus not\nhaving to manage people or add more to my plate.\nIf I could have only one of these—if either earning a return on\nmy investment required managing people, or not managing people\nentailed making less money—which would it be? I’d choose earning\nmore money even if it involved managing people. So I’d move that\ncriterion higher.\nOf course, I’d be willing to manage people only up to a point. If\ndoing that became too time-consuming, I might have to reverse the\norder. That leads us to the next step: adding quantities. As your\ncriteria battle one another, you’ll ﬁnd quantities make a diﬀerence.\nAdd them to each criterion as they battle.\nSuppose I ﬁnd that I’m willing to spend ﬁve to ten additional\nhours per week managing people or being hands on, so long as my\nROI is at least 15 percent per year. If I’d have to invest ten-plus\nhours per week, my ROI would have to be at least 20 percent per\nyear, and if I’d have to invest twenty-plus hours per week, it would\nno longer be worth it to me—regardless of anticipated return—\nbecause of the opportunity cost of that time.\nWhen you’ve ﬁnished ordering these two criteria, go to the next\npair. Move from top to bottom, make your criteria battle one\nanother for priority, and add the quantities that matter to you along\nthe way.\nWhen people do this exercise, they often look at a pair of criteria\nand think, “I don’t necessarily have to choose between those two.”\nMake them battle anyway! The point isn’t really to compare them,\nit’s to ﬁnd out which one is more important. Maybe in real life you\ncan satisfy both criteria—maybe, for instance, you can get a high\nROI while investing in a socially responsible company, or you can\n\f\nget in shape while still eating out three times a week, or you can\nbuy a house in a great location that ﬁts your budget. But often,\nwhen we actually start pursuing an option, we ﬁnd that we have to\nrank one criterion above another—even if only slightly. Most of the\ntime, making your criteria battle is about calibrating shades of gray.\nIt’s a mental exercise that takes you out of reactive mode and moves\nyou toward deliberative thinking.\nAssigning quantitative values to your criteria often helps at this\npoint. When you start comparing things and thinking how much\nyou’ll pay for them—and whether in a currency of time, money,\ncollective brain power—you gain clarity about what matters most\nto you and what doesn’t. You’re forced to think in terms of beneﬁts\nand risks, and you start to see things you didn’t see before—\npreviously invisible costs become visible. For all of these reasons,\nmaking your criteria battle moves you toward objectivity and\naccuracy, and helps reveal what you think is most important.\nOnce you’ve settled on your criteria and their order of\nimportance, it’s time to apply them to the options. Doing so\nrequires that you have information about those options that meets\ntwo conditions: it’s relevant, and it’s accurate.\nMost Information Is Irrelevant\nWhen it comes to getting information that’s relevant to the decision,\nremember this:\nthe targeting principle: Know what you’re looking for before you start\nsorting through the data.\nIf you don’t know what you’re looking for, you’re unlikely to ﬁnd it,\njust as you’re unlikely to hit the target if you don’t know what\nyou’re aiming at. When you don’t know what’s important, you miss\nthings that are relevant and spend a lot of time on things that are\nirrelevant.\nMost information is irrelevant. Knowing what to ignore—\nseparating the signal from the noise—is the key to not wasting\n\f\nvaluable time. Think, for example, of investment decisions. The best\ninvestors know which variables probabilistically govern the\noutcomes, and they pay attention to those. They don’t ignore\neverything else, but focusing primarily on those variables allows\nthem to ﬁlter massive amounts of information very quickly.\nPeople who can quickly distinguish what matters from what\ndoesn’t gain a huge advantage in a world where the ﬂow of\ninformation never stops.\nKnowing what to ignore allows you to focus on what matters.\nFollow the example of the best investors and know the variables\nthat matter for evaluating the options before you start sorting\nthrough information.\nGetting Accurate Information from the Source\nWhen it comes to getting information that’s accurate, there are two\nprinciples you should know: the HiFi Principle and the HiEx\nPrinciple. The ﬁrst will help you ﬁnd the best intel possible from\nwithin any given situation, and the second will help you ﬁnd the\nbest intel possible from outside of it.\nthe hiﬁ principle: Get high-ﬁdelity (HiFi) information—information that’s\nclose to the source and unﬁltered by other people’s biases and interests.\nThe quality of your decisions is directly related to the quality of\nyour thoughts. The quality of your thoughts is directly related to\nthe quality of your information.\nMany people treat all sources of information as if they’re equally\nvalid. They’re not. While you might value getting everyone’s\nopinion, that doesn’t mean each opinion should be equally weighted\nor considered.\nA lot of the information we consume is in the form of highlights,\nsummaries, or distillations. It’s the illusion of knowledge. We learn\nthe answer but can’t show our work.\nConsider what happens when you consult a nutritionist. They\ntake their years of experience and knowledge and compress it into a\n\f\nlist of foods to eat and behaviors to implement. If you just want the\nanswer, they will tell you what to eat and how much. This is an\nabstraction; it’s like you’re back in sixth-grade math class, copying\nanswers from the person beside you. Sure, you got the right answer,\nbut you don’t know why it’s the answer. You lack understanding,\nand information without understanding is dangerous.\nIt’s natural to think these abstractions will save us time and\nimprove our decision-making, but in many cases they don’t.\nReading a summary might be faster than reading a full document,\nbut it misses a lot of details—details that weren’t relevant to the\nperson summarizing the information, but that might be relevant to\nyou. You end up saving time at the cost of missing important\ninformation. Skimming inadvertently creates blind spots.\nInformation is food for the mind. What you put in today shapes\nyour solutions tomorrow. And just as you are responsible for the\nfood that goes into your mouth, you are responsible for the\ninformation that goes into your mind. You can’t be healthy if you\nfeed yourself junk food every day, and you can’t make good\ndecisions if you’re consuming low-quality information. Higher\nquality inputs lead to higher quality outputs.\nThe desire for abstractions is understandable. The amount of\ninformation that bombards us daily can feel overwhelming. But the\nfurther the information is from the original source, the more ﬁlters\nit’s been through before getting to you. Living on a diet of\nabstractions is like living on a diet of junk food: it has less\nnutritional value—less information content, which means you’re not\nlearning as much.\nReal knowledge is earned, while abstractions are merely\nborrowed. Too often decision-makers get their information and\nobservations from sources that are multiple degrees removed from\nthe problem. Relying on these abstractions is a prime opportunity\nfor the ego default to work its mischief. It conjures the illusion of\nknowledge: we feel conﬁdent about what to do without really\nunderstanding the problem.\nYou can’t make good decisions with bad information. In fact,\nwhen you see people making decisions that don’t make sense to\nyou, chances are they’re based on diﬀerent information than you’ve\n\f\nconsumed. Just as junk food eventually makes you unhealthy, bad\ninputs eventually produce bad decisions.\nHow do we get better information?\nThe person closest to the problem often has the most accurate\ninformation about it. What they tend to lack is a broader\nperspective. The person working on the line at McDonald’s knows\nhow to ﬁx a recurring problem at their restaurant better than a\nperson merely analyzing some data. What they don’t know is how it\nﬁts into the bigger picture. They don’t know whether the problem\nexists everywhere, or whether the solution would cause more harm\nthan good if implemented globally, or how to roll the idea out to\neveryone.\nMy friend Tim Urban has a good metaphor to explain this\nconcept. In the restaurant business, there are chefs and there are\nline cooks.[2] Both can follow a recipe. When things go according to\nplan, there is no diﬀerence in the process or the result. But when\nthings go wrong, the chef knows why. The line cook often does not.\nThe chef has cultivated depth of understanding through years of\nexperience, experimentation, and reﬂection, and as a result, the\nchef, rather than the line cook, can diagnose problems when they\narise.[*]\nHistory shows that the greatest thinkers all used information that\nthey collected personally. They earned their knowledge the hard\nway either in the trenches of experience or through careful study of\nexemplars. They looked for raw, unﬁltered information, and\nventured out into the world to interact with it directly.\nLeonardo da Vinci is a great example. He kept journals\nthroughout his life, and they contain notes about how he went\nabout getting the right information. He wrote things like, “Get the\nmaster of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle,” and\n“Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal\nand mill in the Lombard manner.”\nGreat thinkers understand the importance of high-quality\ninformation, and that other people’s abstractions are often limited\nin their usefulness.\nAs information travels up an organization, it tends to lose quality\nand nuance. Remember that children’s game, telephone: you\n\f\nwhisper a sentence to the next person, and that person whispers it\nto the next, and after it passes through half the class, the message is\nnothing like the original sentence. No single person necessarily\nchanges it much, but the more people it passes through, the more\nall those little changes accumulate. The same thing happens when\ninformation travels through an organization. It goes through\nmultiple ﬁlters, including individual levels of understanding,\npolitical interpretation, and biases. Details are abstracted from the\noriginal, and the signal is lost. The various incentives people have\nwhen they communicate information end up complicating things\neven further.\nThe problem isn’t merely that people are unreliable transmitters\nof information; the problem is also that there are limitations on the\ninformation that abstractions can represent. Think of a road map.\nIt’s an abstract representation of a real landscape. That landscape\nincludes rocks, plants, animals, cities, wind, and weather, along\nwith many other things. We don’t represent all of them when we\nmap the landscape, only those things that interest us—for example,\nroads, rivers, and geographical boundaries. We pull these features\naway from the original and represent them in a way that makes\nthem stand out. (That’s in fact what the word “abstract” means: “to\npull away from.”)\nRemoving what doesn’t serve our interests is what makes a map\nuseful. But somewhere in the process, someone has decided what’s\nuseful and what isn’t based on what interests them. What if we’re\ninterested in something else? What if we’re interested in population\ndensities or geological strata? A road map isn’t designed to\nhighlight these concepts, so it’s not going to be very useful to us.\nWhat’s true of maps is true of any other abstractions: by nature,\nthey’re designed to serve the interests of their designers. If those\ndesigners don’t have the same interests as you, their abstractions\naren’t going to give you the information you need. Similarly, any\ninformation you may get from a secondhand source has likely been\nﬁltered through that source’s interests. Since your interests are\nlikely diﬀerent from theirs, their summaries, highlights, and\ndescriptions are likely to leave out relevant information that could\nhelp you with your decision.\n\f\nI learned the importance of accurate information while working\nfor the CEO of a large company. Nothing crossed his desk without\ngoing through me ﬁrst. Early one morning I saw an email from one\nof his direct reports ﬂagging a technical problem that was aﬀecting\noperations. After I told him what I’d heard about the problem, he\nasked a simple question: “Where did you get this information?” I\nreplied that I’d heard it from the VP in charge of the division. The\nlook on his face instantly turned to disappointment. Moments\npassed in silence.\nFinally, he spoke softly, telling me that his decisions could only\nbe as good as his information.\nHe wasn’t getting the raw HiFi information. He knew that people\nin the organization had an incentive to convey things in a way that\ncovered up mistakes or made themselves look good. And he knew\nthat those ﬁlters would obscure rather than clarify the situation.\nIf you want to make better decisions, you need better\ninformation. Whenever possible, you need to learn something, see\nsomething, or do something for yourself. Sometimes the best\ninformation is the least transmissible.\nHiFi Information Reveals Better Options\nUnited States general George Marshall was a supremely competent\nand selﬂess leader. He never left the welfare of his troops to chance.\nHe valued HiFi information and always went to the source.\nAt one point during World War II, the War Department ran into\na diﬃcult situation with the Air Force in the Paciﬁc: pilots were\nrefusing to ﬂy. The reports Marshall received suggested there was\nsomething wrong with the planes. It wasn’t a matter of parts. They\nwere getting all the parts they were asking for. Marshall asked if the\npilots wanted the planes modiﬁed in some way. The American\nplanes were heavier and less maneuverable than the Japanese\nZeros, so he had a plane stripped of its armor to reduce its weight.\nBut that wasn’t the problem. The pilots didn’t want their planes\nstripped of armor.\nMarshall struggled to understand what was going on. Talking to\nthe commander gave him no insight, so he did what he often would:"

Everyone is suspicious. But Marshall\nneeded eyes and ears on the ground to get to the heart of the\nmatter. He knew he’d only get answers by going directly to the\nsource.\nWhat Marshall’s direct report uncovered was that the Air Force\nground crews didn’t have any protection from mosquitoes. They\nhad to work on the planes at night under electric lights, which\nattracted insects, and those mosquitoes were feasting on them. The\nmechanics had gotten so full of malaria or antimalarial medication\nthat the pilots didn’t trust their work and refused to ﬂy.\nThe people back at headquarters, in mosquito-protected areas,\nhad no idea what was really going on in the ﬁeld. They were\nfocused on combat supplies—ammunition, parts, food—but not\nmosquito netting. With his HiFi information, though, Marshall\ndecided to override a portion of the tonnage they’d allocated for\ncombat supplies and get those nets. Problem solved!\nMarshall recognized that the only way to understand a problem\nand solve it was by going to the source.

In order to validate their idea, they set up a\nlanding page, bought some Facebook ads, and started taking orders.\nThey didn’t even have a product or a company yet; they just wanted\nto see if people would buy foam mattresses from them. After a few\ndays of receiving orders, they had all the proof they needed that\npeople would buy their product. They refunded all the orders and\noﬃcially started their company. While this example may be a bit\nunorthodox, there are many ways in which experimenting can help\ndetermine whether there’s suﬃcient demand for a product or\nservice.\nsafeguard: Evaluate the motivations and incentives of your sources.\nRemember that everyone sees things from a limited perspective.\nEvaluating people’s motivations and incentives is especially\nimportant when you don’t have the ability to go and conﬁrm\nsomething for yourself. If you absolutely must rely on someone\nelse’s information and opinions, you have a responsibility to think\nabout the lens through which they view the situation. Everyone has\na limited perspective into the problem. Everyone has a blind spot.\nIt’s your job as the decision-maker to weave their perspective\ntogether with others to get closer to reality.\nA lot of what people consider information or fact is actually just\nopinion, or a few facts mixed with many opinions. For example, if\nyou’re looking to sell your house, everyone who’s involved will\nhave a diﬀerent idea of what you’ll make on the sale: the bank,\nyour real estate agent, the buyer’s agent, your friends, the home\ninspector, the internet, and the government. Each of them sees only\npart of the situation. Each has diﬀerent motivations and incentives\nthat shape how they see the world. To get a clearer picture of the\nconcrete reality, consider how each person stands to beneﬁt from\nthe information they give you, and weave those perspectives\ntogether.\nIt helps to think of each person’s perspective as a lens onto the\n\f\nworld. When you put their glasses on, you see what they see and\nhave better insight into what they might be feeling. But those\nglasses have blind spots, often missing important information or\nconfusing fact with opinion. By trying on all the glasses, you see\nwhat others miss.\nWhen you’re getting information from other people, you need to\nkeep an open mind. That means withholding your own judgment as\nlong as possible. People often undermine the information-gathering\nprocess by subjecting others to their judgments, beliefs, and\nperspective. The point isn’t to argue or disagree, however. Judging\npeople and telling them they’re wrong only shuts them down and\nprevents a free ﬂow of information. When you’re gathering\ninformation, your job is to see the world through other people’s\neyes. You’re trying to understand their experience and how they\nprocessed it. You can learn valuable information even when you\ndon’t agree with their view of the world. Just ask questions, keep\nyour thoughts to yourself, and remain curious about other\nperspectives.\nsafeguard: When you get information from other people, ask questions that\nyield detailed answers. Don’t ask people what they think; instead, ask them\nhow they think.\nIf you ask people what to do in a given situation, you might get the\ncorrect answer, but you haven’t learned anything. Say a local\ngovernment task force needs to hire a software developer for a\nproject, but they have no experience doing so and don’t know what\nto look for. Person A on the task force goes to a developer friend\nand asks, “Whom should I hire for this project?” Person B does the\nsame but instead says, “I’m hiring a software developer, and I’d like\nto learn from your experiences. What skills matter and which ones\ncan be learned on the job? Why? Where do I ﬁnd the best people?\nHow do I test these skills?” And so on.\nPerson B might not have a recommendation within the ﬁrst\nconversation, but I’d give it ten-to-one odds that they ﬁnd a better\ncandidate in the end. The reason: Person B is asking about the\n\f\nprinciples that guide decision-making in this domain, not details\nabout the speciﬁc case. They’re asking others about their earned\nknowledge and making it their own.\nOur goal in decision-making is not just to gather information,\nbut to gather information relevant to our decision. That requires\nmore than building an inventory of data points; it requires\nunderstanding the why and how behind those data points—the\nprinciples that good decision-makers use in this area.\nGetting at those principles requires asking the right kinds of\nquestions. There are three I’d recommend:\nQuestion 1: What are the variables you’d use to make this\ndecision if you were in my shoes? How do those variables\nrelate to one another?\nQuestion 2: What do you know about this problem that I (or\nother people) don’t? What can you see based on your\nexperience that someone without your experience can’t? What\ndo you know that most people miss?\nQuestion 3: What would be your process for deciding if you\nwere in my shoes? How would you go about doing it? (Or:\nHow would you tell your mother/friend to go about doing it?)\nNotice how diﬀerent these questions are from the typical, “Here’s\nmy problem. What should I do?” Remember: the questions you ask\nhelp to determine the quality of the information you get.\nGetting Accurate Information from Experts\nWe’ve talked about the importance of getting high-ﬁdelity\ninformation. The second principle for getting accurate information\nis getting high-expertise information:\nthe hiex principle: Get high-expertise (HiEx) information, which comes\nboth from people with a lot of knowledge and/or experience in a speciﬁc area,\nand from people with knowledge and experience in many areas.\n\f\nWhen someone close to the problem isn’t available to you, look for\npeople who recently solved a similar problem. The word “recent” is\nan important nuance here. When you want speciﬁc advice from an\nexpert, look for someone who recently solved the problem you’re\ntrying to solve. Asking someone who solved your problem twenty\nyears ago how they did it is not likely to oﬀer speciﬁc and eﬀective\ninsights. You want a current expert—and no, I don’t mean the\ntalking heads on TV. They’re rarely actual experts.\nExperts can increase the accuracy of your information and\ndecrease the time it takes to get it. Getting even one expert’s advice\ncan cut through a lot of confusion and help you quickly formulate\nand/or eliminate options.\nI learned the value of expert advice ﬁrsthand when I began\ncoding at an intelligence agency. It was a very diﬀerent experience\nfrom coding as I’d learned it. In school, it was possible to basically\njust Google things and piece them together. People had solved these\nproblems long ago and the solutions hadn’t changed much. My job\nat the intelligence agency was much harder. Not only were we\nprohibited from Googling anything we were coding for security\nreasons, but even if we’d been allowed to, it wouldn’t have helped:\nwe were trying to do things no one had ever done before.\nA few months in, I got stuck on a problem. Really stuck! As a kid\nI’d always taken in a lot of diﬀerent perspectives on a problem, but\nin the end, I always thought if I just put my head down and worked\nharder, I’d ﬁgure it out eventually. Days went by. Then weeks. I\ncouldn’t understand what was happening. Finally, with my head\ndown, I approached someone who had worked on a similar problem\nbefore and explained what I was stuck on.\n“Let me look at your code,” he said. In less than twenty minutes\nhe diagnosed what was wrong: there was a subtle diﬀerence\nbetween what the documentation said would happen and what\nwould actually happen in certain edge cases. Since most people\nwouldn’t run into those edge cases, the problem wasn’t documented\nanywhere. This person had faced and overcome the same problem,\nthough, and it had taken him a long time to solve. He was happy to\nshare his hard-earned knowledge. While I was a bit frustrated that\nI’d wasted weeks out of stubbornness, this exchange kick-started\n\f\nour relationship, and I learned a lot from him over the years.\nEven one expert’s opinion can be more helpful than the thoughts\nand guesses of dozens or hundreds of amateurs. But how do you\nrecruit one to work with you?\nI’ve experienced expert advice from both sides: getting and\ngiving. I reach out to experts all the time for insight, and I have\nthousands of people who reach out to me for advice. Let me share\nwhat I’ve learned on both recruiting experts and working with\nthem.\nGetting Experts on Your Side\nMany people don’t want to reach out to experts for help, either\nbecause they don’t think it’s an option, or because they’re afraid of\nbeing a nuisance. Sometimes, if we know the expert, we’re\nembarrassed. Maybe they’ll discover we know less than we actually\ndo!\nIf you have any anxieties of this sort, the ﬁrst thing to\nunderstand is that experts love sharing what they’ve learned when\nthey know it’ll make a diﬀerence. Helping others achieve their goals\nis one of the things that make life and work meaningful. To put it in\nperspective, think of a time in your life when someone asked you\nfor help on something you excel at, and you came through for them.\nHow did it feel? For most of us, sharing expertise feels pretty good.\nWe enjoy exercising an ability we have, and we also enjoy gaining\nrecognition for having it.\nExperts don’t treat all requests for help equally, though. Some\nrequests really don’t feel good to receive. Usually these are requests\nof the tell-me-what-I-should-do type. Often these people haven’t\ndone the work ahead of time, they just want you to decide for them.\nI get hundreds—if not thousands—of these requests a year. People\nwant me to solve their problems for them. They send twenty pages\nof thoughts and say, “What should I do?”[*]\nRemember: the goal isn’t to have someone tell you what to do;\nrather, it’s to learn how an expert thinks about the problem, which\nvariables they consider relevant, and how those variables interact\nover time. If you present a problem, and an expert simply tells you\n\f\nwhat to do, they’re just giving you an abstraction. You might get\nthe answer right, but you haven’t learned anything. And if things go\nwrong, which they inevitably will, you won’t have a clue as to why.\nYou’re the line cook masquerading as the chef. If you ask them how\nthey think about the problem, that’s when you start deepening your\nunderstanding.\nSo let’s talk about how to approach an expert in a way that will\nset your request apart and get people excited to help you. Here are\nﬁve tips:\n•  Show that you have skin in the game: When you reach out to\nan expert, make them aware of the time, energy, and money\nyou’ve already invested in the problem. Let them know you’ve\ndone the work and that you’re stuck. When I see requests from\nsomeone who shows they’re invested in solving a problem, and\nwho demonstrates they’ve done their research to craft a pitch\naround a very speciﬁc issue I can help with, I’m happy and\neager to respond. Contrast that with emails that say, “Hey\nShane, what do you think of this investment opportunity?”\nWhich would you be more excited to answer?\n•  Get precise on your ask: Be very clear what you’re looking for.\nAre you looking for them to review your plan and provide\nfeedback? Are you looking for them to introduce you to people\nwho can solve the problem? Whatever it is that you want, just\nbe clear.\n•  Show respect for their time and energy: Explicitly stating\nthat the person you’re reaching out to is an expert whose time\nand energy you respect goes a long way to secure their\ngoodwill. You should also demonstrate your respect for them,\nthough. For instance, do not ask for ﬁfteen minutes to pick their\nbrain; instead, ask if they oﬀer one-oﬀ consulting sessions and\nhow much they charge for them. Experts are expensive and\nmost of the time for good reason. If you’re paying $1,000 to\n$2,000 per hour for something, it forces you to get clear on\nwhat you want before you hop on the call. Paying for someone’s\ntime not only compensates them for the value they bring to the\ntable but forces you to make sure you’re not mumbling through\n\f\nthe call and wasting their time and yours.\n•  Ask for their reasons and listen: As mentioned previously,\ndon’t just ask experts what they think, ask them how they think.\nUse them as a resource to train yourself how to evaluate things\nso that you can start embodying an expert way of operating.\nYou don’t have to agree with what they’re saying, but\nremember: your goal is to learn from them how to think better,\nnot to have them solve your problem for you.\n•  Follow up: If you want to build a network and make this more\nthan a transactional request, follow up to report on your\nprogress no matter what the outcome is. Whether their advice\nhelped you in this case or not, following up and keeping them\nupdated on your progress primes them to help you in the future.\nWhen they see that you took their advice seriously, they’re\ngoing to want to help you again.\nOf course, most experts aren’t able to respond to everyone who\nneeds their help. It’s much easier if you develop a personal\nrelationship with people before you need their help. That way the\nrequest isn’t purely transactional. It’s impossible to predict which\nﬁelds you might someday need an expert in, but that’s one reason\nto cast a wide net socially and professionally. I just looked at my\ninbox last week and had ﬁfty-three requests for “help” in one form\nor another. Two were from friends. I can’t reply to them all, so\nwhere do you think my time will go?\nExperts vs. Imitators\nGetting HiEx information requires that you get help from real\nexperts. But there are many people who claim to be experts (or\nwhom other people claim to be experts) who really aren’t.\nsafeguard: Take time to distinguish real experts from imitators. Not\neveryone who claims to be an expert is. Take the time to know the diﬀerence.\nThink of all the money managers who borrow their talking points\n\f\nfrom Warren Buﬀett. They might sound like Buﬀett, but they don’t\nknow how to invest the way Buﬀett does. They’re imitators. Charlie\nMunger once commented on this: “It’s very hard to tell the\ndiﬀerence between a good money manager and someone who just\nhas the patter down.”\nBut what if you’re not an expert yourself? How do you tell the\ndiﬀerence between an expert and an imitator?\nExperts are usually enthusiastic about their area of expertise.\nThat’s why they’re good at it: they spend even their spare time\nmastering and reﬁning their knowledge and skills, and it shows.\nImitators are less concerned with being great and more concerned\nwith looking great. That concern makes it easy for the ego to take\nover.\nHere are some things to look for:\n•  Imitators can’t answer questions at a deeper level. Speciﬁc\nknowledge is earned, not learned, so imitators don’t fully\nunderstand the ideas they’re talking about.[*] Their knowledge\nis shallow. As a result, when you ask about details, or ﬁrst\nprinciples or nonstandard cases, they don’t have good answers.\n•  Imitators can’t adapt their vocabulary. They can explain\nthings using only the vocabulary they were taught, which is\noften full of jargon. Because they don’t fully understand the\nideas behind the vocabulary, they can’t adapt the way they talk\nabout those ideas to express them more clearly to their\naudience.\n•  Imitators get frustrated when you say you don’t\nunderstand. That frustration is a result of being overly\nconcerned with the appearance of expertise—which they might\nnot be able to maintain if they have to really get into the weeds\nwith an explanation. Real experts have earned their expertise\nand are excited about trying to share what they know. They\naren’t frustrated by your lack of understanding; they instead\nlove your genuine curiosity about something they care about.\n•  Experts can tell you all the ways they’ve failed. They know\nand accept that some form of failure is often part of the learning\nprocess. Imitators, however, are less likely to own up to\n\f\nmistakes because they’re afraid it will tarnish the image they’re\ntrying to project.\n•  Imitators don’t know the limits of their expertise. Experts\nknow what they know, and also know what they don’t know.\nThey understand that their understanding has boundaries, and\nthey’re able to tell you when they’re approaching the limits of\ntheir circle of competence. Imitators can’t. They can’t tell when\nthey’re crossing the boundary into things they don’t understand.\nA ﬁnal note on distinguishing experts from imitators: Many of us\nlearn about a subject not by reading original research or listening to\nthe expert for hours, but by reading something intended to be\nhighly transmissible. Think again of the diﬀerence between reading\nan academic article and reading a newspaper article about it. While\nthey know more than the layman, popularizers are not experts\nthemselves. Instead, they are good at clearly and memorably\ncommunicating ideas. As a result, popularizers often get mistaken\nfor experts. Keep that in mind when you’re in the market for an\nexpert: the person with real expertise is often not the person who\nmade the subject popular."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 4.4\nDo it!\nYou’ve considered the options. You’ve evaluated them. You’ve\nfound the best. It’s time to act!\nThere is no purpose to knowing what you should do and not\ndoing it. If you want results, you need action.\nMaking a judgment and executing it is easier than it seems and\nharder than others imagine. One reason we fail to take action is that\nwe’re scared to deal with the consequences. It’s not so much that we\ndon’t know what to do as much as we don’t want to deal with the\nreality of doing it. We don’t want to have conversations, because\nthey might hurt people’s feelings. We don’t want to ﬁre the person\nthat we like, even though we know they’re wrong for the job.\nOur ego conspires with the social default and the inertia default\nto weaken our resolve and keep us from doing what we need to do.\nBut that’s not the only reason we fail to act.\nAnother big reason we ﬁnd action hard is that we’re afraid of\nbeing wrong. In this case inertia holds us in place as we gather\nmore and more information in the false hope that we can ultimately\neliminate uncertainty.\nThere are three principles that can help you know when to stop\ndeliberating and start acting. But ﬁrst, let’s discuss a helpful way of\ncategorizing decisions by considering how consequential they are,\nand how reversible they are.\nConsequentiality and Reversibility\nConsequential decisions aﬀect the things that matter most: whom\nyou marry, where you live, which business you launch. The more a\n\f\ndecision aﬀects what matters to you—either in the short term or the\nlong term—the more consequential it is.\nReversible decisions can be undone by a later course of action.\nThe harder or more costly it is to undo a decision’s eﬀects, the less\nreversible it is. It’s easy to eat a chocolate bar, but once you’ve\neaten it, it’s done. You can’t undo it. Having a baby is the same.\nOnce you have one, you can’t undo it (nor would you want to!). At\nthe other extreme would be a decision whose eﬀects cost nothing to\nundo. I can decide to sign up for a free fourteen-day trial of\nsomething, knowing full well it’s easy to undo.\nWe can represent diﬀerent kinds of decisions in terms of their\ndegrees of consequence and reversibility on a graph (see the\nfollowing ﬁgure). Among these decisions, two types deserve special\nattention: decisions that are highly consequential and irreversible,\nand decisions that are inconsequential and highly reversible.\nWhen a decision is highly consequential and irreversible, its\neﬀects ripple throughout your life, and there’s no way to stop them.\nSome people call these “lead dominoes.”\nWhen decisions are like lead dominoes, the cost of a mistake is\nhigh. Exactly the opposite is true of a decision that’s\ninconsequential and easily reversed. The cost of a mistake is low: if\nyou don’t like the outcome, you can just reverse it. The biggest\nmistake in cases like these is wasting time and mental energy. If you\ncan take something back, or it doesn’t really matter, continuing to\ngather information becomes a drain on resources.\n\f\nIf you’ve ever bought a mattress, you’ll know exactly what I\nmean. You spend hours—if not days—looking at mattresses, reading\nreviews, comparing prices, and considering whether you’re a hot or\ncold sleeper. You ﬁnally decide on a mattress, and have it delivered,\nonly to ﬁnd that it isn’t what you dreamed of. So you exchange it\nfor your fallback option anyway. You could have saved hours or\ndays simply ensuring the store had a ﬂexible return policy, deciding\non a mattress within an hour, and moving on. When the cost of a\nmistake is low, move fast.\nThree Principles for Action\nNow that we have a way of categorizing decisions by their degrees\nof consequence and revisability, let’s talk about some principles.\nThe ﬁrst is this:\nthe asap principle: If the cost to undo the decision is low, make it as soon\nas possible.\nIn fact, if something is too inconsequential, then engaging in any\n\f\ndecision-making might be a waste. Just choose. Decide quickly, and\nlearn by doing. You’ll save time, energy, and resources that you can\nuse for decisions that really matter.\nIf, on the other hand, the decision is highly consequential and\nirreversible, then the stakes are high. The biggest risk here is\nmoving too fast and missing something important. You want to\ngather as much information as you can before deciding. Therefore,\nthe second principle is:\nthe alap principle: If the cost to undo a decision is high, make it as late as\npossible.\nRemember to factor the cost of analysis into your decisions. This is\nsomething many people fail to do. Most decisions require an art\nthat balances speed and accuracy. When you move too slowly on\nsmall decisions, you waste time and energy, no matter how accurate\nyou may be. When you go too fast, you miss crucial information,\nmake assumptions, overlook the basics, rush to judgment, and often\nsolve the wrong problem. When things are hectic, however—even\nwhen speed matters—you need to slow down, just a little.\nMichael Lewis gives an example of this in The Undoing Project\nabout a woman who crashed head on into another car.[1] Medics\nrushed her to Sunnybrook Hospital, which is located next to\nCanada’s busiest stretch of highway. Sunnybrook had a reputation\nfor treating the emergencies and traumas that come from car\ncrashes, yet the woman had so many broken bones, the physicians\nmissed some. Don Redelmeier was the Sunnybrook epidemiologist.\nHis job was to “check the understanding of the specialists for\nmental errors.” He was there, in other words, to check other\npeople’s thinking. “Wherever there is uncertainty there has got to\nbe judgment,” said Redelmeier, “and wherever there is judgment\nthere is an opportunity for human fallibility.” Doctors may be\nexperts, but they’re still human, still fallible, and to complicate\nthings further, their patients often give them unreliable\ninformation.\nWhen things move fast, and life-and-death decisions need to be\n\f\nmade, we often see only the things we’re speciﬁcally trained to see,\nand miss others that are nevertheless relevant. In this case, the\nwoman presented another problem beyond all the broken bones:\nher heartbeat was highly irregular. Before she lost consciousness,\nshe mentioned a history of an overactive thyroid, which is a classic\ncause of an irregular heartbeat.\nRedelmeier entered as the team looking after her was preparing\nto administer the drugs for hyperthyroidism: “[He] asked everyone\nto slow down. To wait. Just a moment. Just to check their thinking\n—and to make sure they were not trying to force the facts into an\neasy, coherent, but ultimately false story.”\nHe wanted to slow things down because they had leaped to a\nconclusion that seemed to ﬁt without considering other reasons:\n“Hyperthyroidism is a classic cause of an irregular heart rhythm,\nbut hyperthyroidism is an infrequent cause of an irregular heart\nrhythm,” he would say later. While it ﬁt, it was unlikely—possible\nbut not probable.\nThe staﬀ began searching for other causes, and quickly\ndetermined she had a collapsed lung. “Like her fractured ribs, her\ncollapsed lung had failed to turn up on the X-ray. Unlike the\nfractured ribs, it could kill her.” They ignored the thyroid and\ntreated the collapsed lung, and her heartbeat returned to normal.\nWhen her oﬃcial thyroid tests came back the next day, they were\nnormal. As Redelmeier said, “You need to be so careful when there\nis one simple diagnosis that instantly pops into your mind that\nbeautifully explains everything all at once. That’s when you need to\nstop and check your thinking.”\nWhen the stakes are high, and there are no take-backs, you want\nto decide at the last moment possible, and keep as many options on\nthe table as you can while continuing to gather information.\nIn driver’s education, we learn that when you’re on the freeway\ndriving at high speeds, you need to keep a pocket open in front of\nyou in case someone unexpectedly veers into your lane or stops\nabruptly. Keeping extra distance between cars allows you to keep\noptions open for whatever might happen. This is the same reason\nyou should wait as long as possible when making an important\ndecision. You want to give yourself as many options in the future so\n\f\nthat if something changes, you have the space to maneuver and\nreposition yourself along the path of greatest opportunity.\nHow do you know when it’s ﬁnally time to act?\nWhen the cost of failure is cheap, the speed at which you come\nto a decision matters as much as the decision itself. When failure is\nexpensive, it makes sense to learn more before taking action.\nDefaults can transform caution into an excuse not to act if you\ndon’t resist them. Anyone who has held on to a failing job,\nrelationship, or investment too long knows that information\ngathering reaches a point of diminishing returns—at some point the\ncost of getting more information is exceeded by the cost of losing\ntime or opportunity.\nA friend of mine works with engineers. He says they tend to be\nhighly risk averse: they wait as long as possible to decide and can’t\ntell when they should act more quickly. “They keep thinking that\ngathering more data will make things ﬁrmer,” he said, “but they’ve\nalready been prototyping and gathering information for months.\nThey don’t know when to stop and commit. They start losing\ninterest in the problem too, because all they’re doing is having\nmeetings, aligning, gathering information, and writing up a giant\ndocument laying out how they made their decision. They’re all\naware of basic decision-making skills, but they really, really\nstruggle to know when enough is enough.” And it’s not just\nengineers.\nDecision-makers at large have become increasingly susceptible to\n\f\nanalysis paralysis because so much data has become available to\nthem. If you’ve ever struggled with analysis paralysis, a third\nprinciple can help you know when to stop deliberating and start\nacting:\nthe stop, ﬂop, know principle: Stop gathering more information and\nexecute your decision when either you Stop gathering useful information, you\nFirst Lose an OPportunity (FLOP), or you come to Know something that\nmakes it evident what option you should choose.\nLet’s consider the Stop, FLOP, and Know conditions one at a time.\nFirst, when you’ve stopped gathering useful information, it’s\ntime to act. More information isn’t always better, and there are\nsigns that you’ve gathered enough. When I interviewed The\nPrinceton Review co-founder Adam Robinson,[2] for instance, he told\nme about a seminal study done by a psychologist named Paul Slovic\nback in 1974 that illustrates the folly of gathering too much\ninformation.\nSlovic put eight horse handicappers in the same room and told\nthem he wanted to see how well they could predict the winners of\nforty horse races, over four rounds of ten races each. In the ﬁrst\nround each handicapper was given any ﬁve pieces of information he\nwanted on each horse. One handicapper might want the height and\nweight of the jockey; another might want the highest ﬁnish a horse\nhad ever had. The handicappers also had to state how conﬁdent\nthey were in their predictions.\nAt the end of the ﬁrst round, with only ﬁve pieces of\ninformation, they were 17 percent accurate. Given there were ten\nhorses to a race, they were 70 percent better than the 10 percent\nchance they’d have with zero information. They were 19 percent\nconﬁdent in their predictions, which isn’t too far from their actual\nresults.\nEach round gave them more and more information. For round\ntwo they were given ten pieces of information, then twenty in\nround three, and forty in the fourth and ﬁnal round.\nIn the ﬁnal round, they were still only 17 percent accurate. The\n\f\nthirty-ﬁve additional pieces of information did, however, move\ntheir conﬁdence level to 34 percent. All of the extra information\nmade them no more accurate but a lot more conﬁdent.\nConﬁdence increases faster than accuracy. “The trouble with too\nmuch information,” Robinson told me, “is you can’t reason with it.”\nIt only feeds conﬁrmation bias. We ignore additional information\nthat doesn’t agree with our assessment, and gain conﬁdence from\nadditional information that does.\nIn my life and in the lives of people I’ve worked with, these are\nsome signs you’ve hit the limit of useful information you can\ngather:\n•  You are able to argue credibly for and against the options\nyou’re considering from all angles.\n•  You’re stretching for insight by asking people for advice who\nare more than one step removed from the problem or who don’t\nhave experience solving problems of this sort.\n•  You feel like you need to learn more, but you’ve stopped\nlearning new things, and are instead in a constant loop\nreviewing the same information (or same arguments) over and\nover.\nWhen you’ve hit any of these points, you’ve probably gotten all the\nuseful information you’re going to get. It’s time to decide. That’s\nStop, now let’s move on to FLOP.\nIf you’re facing a highly consequential and irreversible decision,\nand you’re waiting as long as possible to make up your mind, the\ntime to decide is when you start losing opportunities. For example,\nif you’re selling a house, you might want to wait as long as possible\nto actually sell it. You go as far as listing it, setting a price, and\ngetting oﬀers, but when buyers start walking away, or you’re about\nto break a legal contract, then you’re starting to lose options, and\nit’s time to act.\nLikewise, suppose your partner wants to take your relationship\nto the next level—be it going exclusive, living together, or getting\nengaged. Those are big deﬁning moments in your relationship, and\nif you’re unsure, it makes sense to take your time deciding. But\n\f\neventually your partner is going to get fed up and walk away. Right\nbefore that happens, when your partner makes it clear that you’re\non the threshold of losing options, it’s time to decide.\nRemember, the rationale behind the ALAP Principle is to\npreserve optionality. When options start diminishing, it’s time to act\nusing whatever information you have. That’s FLOP: if you’re\nwaiting to decide, wait no longer than your First Lost Opportunity.\nIt’s ﬁnally time to act when you come to know something that\nmakes it clear what you should do. Sometimes you gather a critical\npiece of information that makes your decision easy, perhaps a First\nLost Opportunity. Other times, especially in more ambiguous\nsituations like relationships, it’s just a gut feeling that doesn’t go\naway or change. Either way, there’s always a moment when you\nsimply know at a core level exactly what to do.\nKnowing what to do isn’t enough, though. You have to take\naction.\nDo it!"

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 4.5\nMargin of Safety\nYou don’t always need to have the ultimate solution to make\nprogress. If it remains unclear which path is best, often the next\nbest step is just to eliminate paths that lead to outcomes you don’t\nwant. Avoiding the worst outcomes maintains optionality and keeps\nyou moving forward.\nSometimes things fail for reasons beyond our control. A lot of\ntricky and highly consequential decisions, though, fail for\npreventable reasons. When we don’t consider how things might go\nwrong and plan for them in advance, we’re left ﬂat-footed when\nthey do go wrong. Then we end up reacting instead of reasoning.\nIt’s much easier to plan for things that could go wrong in advance\nwhen you’re calm and open-minded than it is to respond when\nthings are in the midst of going wrong.\nWhen failure is expensive, it’s worth investing in large margins\nof safety.\nIf you’re an investor, you’ve likely heard the story of Long-Term\nCapital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund founded in 1994 by a\nprominent investor who managed to get two Nobel laureates on his\nboard. LTCM had a high risk portfolio that was highly acclaimed for\nits incredible returns—over 21 percent in its ﬁrst year, then 43\npercent in its second year, and 41 percent in its third year.\nImagine being an investor in this environment. You see this\nhedge fund taking oﬀ, and your friends are boasting of their success\nand urging you to join in on the bonanza. They tell you about the\namazing people working there—people with incredibly high IQs,\nincluding two Nobel Prize winners, who are also experienced in\ntheir respective ﬁelds and who have invested substantial amounts of\n\f\ntheir own money.\nYou watch your friends double and then quadruple their\ninvestments. You start wondering whether you should invest\neverything as well. Your own portfolio is returning 8 to 12 percent\nyear over year—good returns, but not 40 percent! Is the rest of the\nworld going to get rich while you play it safe?\nConsider now two scenarios. In the ﬁrst, you decide to follow\nyour friends and invest everything you have in the fund. A few\nmonths later, Asia and Russia experience a ﬁnancial crisis. That\ncrisis together with LTCM’s highly leveraged investments loses them\n$4.6 billion in less than four months. The chart on the next page\nshows what that loss would look like if you had invested $1,000\nfrom the beginning in 1994. In this scenario, you (and your friends)\nend up in ﬁnancial ruin.\nImagine now a diﬀerent scenario. It’s November 1997. You just\nhit the peak of returns at LTCM. If you anticipate that the future is\ngoing to be diﬀerent from the past, you probably won’t assume\nastronomical losses, and might invest a little. But if you’re wise,\nyou’ll maintain a margin of safety.\nA margin of safety is a buﬀer between what you expect to\nhappen and what could happen. It’s designed to save you when\nsurprises are expensive.\n\f\nSource: Jay Henry, Wikimedia Commons, October 26, 2009\nA margin of safety is like having insurance. If you know in\nadvance you won’t need to make a claim this year, it’s a waste of\nmoney to buy insurance. The problem is that you don’t know in\nwhat year you’ll need to make a claim, so you buy it every year. It\nmight seem like a waste of money in years when nothing happens,\nbut it shows its real value in years when something does.\nBuilding a margin of safety means giving yourself as much\ncushioning and coverage in the future as possible. It’s a way of\npreparing yourself for the widest range of possible future outcomes\n—and protecting yourself against the worst ones. In the second\nscenario, for instance, you can prepare yourself for the various bad\noutcomes that 1998 might bring by investing only one tenth of your\nportfolio in the fund. As a result, when the 1998 ﬁnancial crisis\ncomes, you’ll lose at most 10 percent of your investments. That\nwon’t leave you happy, but it won’t leave you ﬁnancially ruined\neither.\nYour defaults are hard at work in the ﬁrst scenario—not just the\nsocial default that convinces you that you’re better oﬀ following the\ncrowd, but the ego default as well. It convinces you that you don’t\nneed a margin of safety, because you know what’s going to happen.\nYou feel conﬁdent predicting the future—predicting that the future\nis going to be like the past, that LTCM’s fourth year is going to be\nlike its ﬁrst three. The problem is that tomorrow is never exactly\nlike today, and in that fourth year, the plan that garnered LTCM’s\nsuccess in the previous three years stops working.\nIn the second scenario, your decision isn’t based on a prediction;\nit’s instead prepared for a future in which your best-case scenario\nmight not materialize. It’s that preparation mindset—as opposed to\na prediction mindset—that saves you in the second scenario.\nWarren Buﬀett has a saying that I often come back to:\n“Diversiﬁcation is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense\nif you know what you are doing.”[1] The thing is, most of us rarely\nknow what we are doing with the conﬁdence required to go all in.\nWhen you don’t know what you are doing, a margin of safety saves\nyou from the worst outcomes. Even when you do know what you’re\n\f\ndoing and you make the best possible decision at the time, things\ncan change.\nIf the worst-case outcomes never come to pass, the margin of\nsafety will appear like a waste. The minute you convince yourself\nyou could have done better without a margin of safety is exactly\nwhen you need it most.\nWe can’t prepare for everything. Some horriﬁc events defy\nimagination, and no amount of preparation can ever give you\nenough optionality to deal with them. Yet we know from history\nthat there are certain unfortunate events that we’re guaranteed to\nexperience and that we can in fact prepare for, even if we have no\nidea when they’ll arrive. On a personal level, these include:\n•  Grief from losing a loved one\n•  Health issues\n•  Relationship changes\n•  Financial pressures\n•  Challenges in meeting our career goals\nOn a more macro level, they include the following:\n•  War and political dissent\n•  Natural disasters\n•  Environmental and ecological changes\n•  Economic ﬂuctuations: both collapse and growth\n•  Technological advances and resistance to them\nHow do you build a margin of safety?\nLet’s start with a very typical application. Engineers build\nmargins of safety into everything they design. Suppose, for instance,\nthat we’re designing a bridge and calculate that on an average day\nit will need to support 5,000 tons at any one time.\nIf we build it to withstand 5,001 tons, we have no margin of\nsafety: What if there’s heavier traﬃc than usual one day? What if\nour calculations and estimates are a little oﬀ? What if the material\nweakens over time at a rate faster than we imagined? To account\nfor all of these contingencies, we’d need to design the bridge to\n\f\nwithstand 10,000 or even 20,000 tons. Why? Because we don’t\nknow what the future will bring. We don’t know whether multiple\ntrucks will ever get stuck on the bridge at the same time. We don’t\nknow whether vehicles in the future will be much heavier than they\nare now. We don’t know many things about the future. So we\ndesign the bridge in a way that protects travelers in the widest\nrange of possible future outcomes.\nKeep in mind as you’re preparing for the future that the worst\noutcomes in history have always surprised people at the time. You\ncan’t use the historical worst case as your baseline. Engineers don’t\nrely just on the historical use of current bridges. You have to really\nstretch your imagination to explore and anticipate what could\npotentially go wrong.\nHere’s a simple heuristic for creating a margin of safety so you\nknow when “enough is enough.”\ntip: The margin of safety is often suﬃcient when it can absorb double the\nworst-case scenario. So the baseline for a margin of safety is one that could\nwithstand twice the amount of problems that would cause a crisis, or maintain\ntwice the amount of resources needed to rebuild after a crisis.\nFor example, if you want to feel ﬁnancially secure even if you lose\nyour job, you can estimate how long it will take you to gain\nemployment again, and then save enough to live oﬀ savings for\ndouble that amount of time.\nThat’s our baseline. But we need to adapt our margin of safety to\nthe individual and situational circumstances. If the cost of failure is\nhigh, and outcomes are more consequential, you want a large\nmargin of safety. For instance, if you’re worried about losing your\njob, and you’re in a sector or economy that’s volatile, you’ll want to\nincrease the length of time you can take care of yourself while\nunemployed.\nIf the cost of failure is low, and outcomes are less consequential,\nyou can often reduce or skip the margin of safety. The longer\nsomething exists and performs well, the higher the probability that\nits pattern of success will continue. Coca-Cola isn’t going anywhere\n\f\nin the near future; neither is Johnson & Johnson.\nYet even established patterns aren’t foolproof. As Nassim Taleb\nwrites in The Black Swan, “Consider a turkey that is fed every day.\nEvery single feeding will ﬁrm up the bird’s belief that it is the\ngeneral rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the\nhuman race ‘looking out for its best interests,’ as a politician would\nsay. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,\nsomething unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a\nrevision of belief.” Our outcomes can sometimes upend even our\nmost well-established expectations.\nHowever, if you have a lot of expertise and data, you can reduce\nyour margin of safety yet further. Here’s an example: Warren\nBuﬀett aims to buy stocks that are 30–50 percent less than their\ntrue value. So he has a 30–50 percent margin of safety on stocks.\nBut he’ll pay close to a dollar on the dollar for stocks that he\nunderstands well. So there’s only maybe a 20 percent margin of\nsafety on the stocks he’s the most conﬁdent in.\nOne of Warren Buﬀett’s core tenets for buying a business is that\nif he doesn’t understand it, he doesn’t buy it. In other words, if he\ndoesn’t have enough information to calculate a margin of safety, he\ndoesn’t invest at all. He also knows that not all margins of safety\nwill protect him—the goal isn’t to get it perfect for every stock he\nbuys; it’s to use the best possible strategy for all his stocks in the big\npicture.\nHere’s the bottom line: Predicting the future is harder than it\nseems. Things are great until they’re not. If things are good, a\nmargin of safety seems like a waste. When things go wrong, though,\nyou can’t live without it. You need a margin of safety most at the\nvery moment you start to think you don’t.\nBullets before Cannonballs\nIf you’re still gathering information, don’t get overinvested in just\none option. Keep your future options open by taking small, low-risk\nsteps toward as many options as possible before committing\neverything to just one.\nWhen you’re gathering information about your options, your\n\f\nbest bet is to gather as much information as possible about each\nwithout investing too much time, money, or energy in any\nparticular one. In Great by Choice, Morten Hansen and Jim Collins\ncall this approach shooting bullets before cannonballs:[2]\nPicture yourself at sea, a hostile ship bearing down on you.\nYou have a limited amount of gunpowder. You take all your\ngunpowder and use it to ﬁre a big cannonball. The cannonball\nﬂies out over the ocean . . . and misses the target, oﬀ by 40\ndegrees. You turn to your stockpile and discover that you’re\nout of gunpowder. You die.\nBut suppose instead that when you see the ship bearing\ndown, you take a little bit of gunpowder and ﬁre a bullet. It\nmisses by 40 degrees. You make another bullet and ﬁre. It\nmisses by 30 degrees. You make a third bullet and ﬁre,\nmissing by only 10 degrees. The next bullet hits—ping!—the\nhull of the oncoming ship. Now, you take all the remaining\ngunpowder and ﬁre a big cannonball along the same line of\nsight, which sinks the enemy ship. You live.[3]\nHere’s an example of bullets before cannonballs that I witnessed in\nreal life. A client of mine—we’ll call him Solomon—was looking to\nhire someone to run his manufacturing business so he could step\ndown and pursue other opportunities. He tried twice to choose a\nCEO to replace him. But each time, while the candidate looked\ngreat on paper, they didn’t work out in practice.\nI recommended that instead of investing heavily in one\ncandidate and turning down others, he should have two or three\ncandidates perform a small test project lasting a couple weeks.\nThese small simultaneous tests would maintain his optionality, and\nseeing the candidates perform in real life would be magnitudes\nmore insightful than interviewing them or reading their résumés.\nThe two candidates were paid well for their time and tasked\nwith a project that required them to work with the team to\nunderstand the problem, gather information, and chart a course\nforward.\nThe plan worked, and it yielded a surprising result: the candidate\n\f\nwith the less impressive résumé was far and away the best with the\nteam and made recommendations that ended up saving Solomon’s\ncompany more than they’d paid for the project. More importantly,\nif neither of the candidates had worked out, the company wasn’t\nsaddled with an expensive exit cost.\nPerforming small, low-risk experiments on multiple options—in\nother words, shooting bullets and calibrating—keeps your options\nopen before you commit the bulk of your resources to shooting a\ncannonball. Thinking about medical school? Shadow a doctor or a\nresident for a day. Take the MCAT and see what you score, or apply\nto colleges and see where you’re accepted. Thinking about a new\ncareer? Try doing it freelance a few nights per week ﬁrst. Thinking\nabout launching a new product? See if people are willing to pay for\nit before you build it.\nPreserving options carries a cost and can make you feel like\nyou’re missing out. It’s hard watching others take action sometimes,\neven when those actions don’t make sense for you. Don’t be fooled!\nThis is the social default at work. It tempts you to feel like it’s okay\nto fail so long as you’re part of the crowd.\nWhile some people are quick to join the crowd, others prefer to\nbe correct. Preserving optionality can make you look stupid in the\nshort term, which means that from time to time you’ll have to\ntolerate people treating you like you’re a fool. But if you look at the\nmost successful people in the world, they’ve all looked short-term\nstupid on a number of occasions, when they were keeping their\noptions open and waiting for the right time to act.\nWarren Buﬀett sat out most of the dot-com craze of the late ’90s,\nand appeared to miss the stampeding bull market that came with it.\nPeople began chattering that he’d lost his touch. He may have\nlooked stupid to some speculators for a few years—until the tech\nbubble burst and he still had tremendous cash reserves.\nLive with a Decision before Announcing It\nHave you ever spent time crafting an email, and then instantly\nregretted it as soon as you hit “Send”? I have. It’s one of the worst\nfeelings in the world. Perhaps not as bad, though, as announcing a\n\f\nmajor decision too soon and then realizing it was a mistake.\nMany leaders want to announce a decision the moment they’ve\nmade it. This is natural: they want to show others how decisive they\nare, and let everyone else revel in their dazzling new venture. But\nannouncing right away can be like the email you can’t unsend. It\nstarts things moving, and makes changing your mind much harder.\nThat’s why I created a rule for myself: I make major decisions and\nthen sleep on them before telling anyone.[*]\nHowever, it turned out that sleeping on decisions by itself wasn’t\nenough. I added another element to the rule: before going to bed, I\nwould write a note to myself explaining why I’d made the decision.\nDoing so allowed me to make the invisible visible. When I woke up\nin the morning, I’d read the note. More often than I’d like to admit,\nmy best thinking from the day before fell short upon inspection in\nthe harsh light of the morning. Sometimes I’d realize I really didn’t\nunderstand the problem as well as I thought I did. Other times, it\njust didn’t feel right anymore. And I’ve come to learn that this\nfeeling is important to explore.\nLiving with a decision before announcing it allows you to look at\nit from a new perspective and verify your assumptions. Once you’ve\nmade the decision—even if you haven’t communicated it—you start\nseeing things in a new light.[*] Your brain processes all the potential\nresults of the decision as though it had already been made and put\ninto action. This can often help you see nuances you might have\nmissed, and those might, in turn, change how you implement the\ndecision. Maybe you’re promoting someone, and you’re worried\nabout their ability to lead a meeting and organize a team. Living\nwith the decision might spur you to have them organize a meeting,\nsee what happens, and recalibrate if necessary.\nAlso, living with a decision on your own for a day—or even two\n—allows you to check it with your emotions. Does this decision feel\ngood in your bones? Do your brain and your heart and your guts all\nagree with it? Most decisions will feel ﬁne. But a handful won’t. If\none doesn’t feel right, it’s a sign that something is oﬀ, and you need\nto dig deeper before announcing your decision. Keeping it to\nyourself before executing allows you to keep open the possibility of\nundoing it."

    "raw_text": "The Fail-Safe Principle\nImplementing fail-safes will help ensure that your decision is\nexecuted according to plan.\nImagine standing on Mount Everest, just ﬁfty meters from\nreaching the very top. Your entire body is aching. Your mind is\nnumb. It feels like no matter how hard you breathe there’s just not\nenough oxygen. You’ve been training for years, spent $60,000 on\nguides and travel, sacriﬁcing time with your family and friends in\nthe process. You’ve told everyone today is the day you’ll make the\nattempt. Everything you’ve worked for is right in front of you. You\ncan see your goal. You’re nearly there. But you’re thirty minutes\nbehind schedule, and oxygen is running low. Do you turn around or\npush forward?\nThe world’s best Sherpas know that the most dangerous part of\nsummiting Mount Everest isn’t reaching the peak; it’s the descent.\nSo much energy is spent getting to the top that even if climbers are\nrunning out of strength or oxygen, they keep pushing themselves to\nthe summit. They spend so much of their resources getting there,\nthey neglect to account for the ordeal of getting back. Lost in\n“summit fever” they forget that the most important thing isn’t\nmaking it to the top, but making it home. You can’t win, after all, if\nyou don’t survive.\nFor those of us outside the situation, likely with no plans to\nclimb Everest, the idea of summit fever seems a bit ridiculous:\nreaching the summit isn’t worth someone’s life! But for those on the\ntop of the mountain, turning their backs on a dream that’s so close\nthey can see it is much harder. Plus, the incredible amounts of\nenergy spent climbing the mountain stresses the body and impairs\nthe mind—conditions that the defaults use to subvert your carefully\nlaid plans and prevent you from reaching your true objectives.\nClimbing Everest is a dramatic example of why it’s important to\nimplement execution fail-safes to ensure your decision gets\nexecuted as planned. Is it ﬁnally time to bail when you’re running\nout of oxygen? Should you stay the course even though your other\nequipment is on its last legs? Execution fail-safes leverage your\nthinking when you’re at your best to protect you against the\n\f\ndefaults when you’re at your worst.\nThe idea of an execution fail-safe is well illustrated by the Greek\nmyth of Ulysses. Ulysses was the captain of his ship. He and his\ncrew were navigating close to the island inhabited by the Sirens,\ndangerous creatures that lured sailors to their deaths with their\nsong—a song so beautiful that it drove crews mad with longing till\nthey ran their ships against the rocks trying to reach its source.\nUlysses wanted to hear the Sirens’ song without risking the lives\nof his crew. Now, I’m not saying that Ulysses made a great decision\nhere. If he’d really thought through his options using the principles\nand safeguards I’ve outlined, he would’ve steered clear of the\nisland. But that’s not the part I love about the story. What I love is\nthat Ulysses implemented fail-safes to ensure his decision was\nexecuted as planned.\nHe stuﬀed the ears of his crew with beeswax so they couldn’t\nhear the song as they approached the island. And to prevent them\nfrom changing course, he had them tie him to the mast so that no\nmatter what he said or did in the madness of the song, he couldn’t\ninﬂuence them or change the decision he’d already made. He also\ninstructed them that the more he struggled and insisted on\nchanging course, the tighter they should bind him.\nUlysses’s clever implementation of execution fail-safes allowed\nhim to hear the song while ensuring the safety of his crew. Of\ncourse, fail-safes are indispensable in a lot of other contexts too.\nThree Kinds of Execution Fail-Safes\nThere are three kinds of execution fail-safes you should know:\nsetting trip wires, empowering others to make decisions, and tying\nyour hands.\nfail-safe: Set up trip wires to determine in advance what you’ll do when you\nhit a speciﬁc quantiﬁable time, amount, or circumstance.\nTrip wires are forms of precommitment—you commit yourself in\nadvance to a course of action when certain conditions arise. For\n\f\nexample, a team climbing Everest might set up a trip wire by\ncommitting themselves to abort their summit attempt if they don’t\nreach a certain location by a certain time. If the team fails, they\nturn back! No argument. They don’t try to decide in the midst of\nfatigue and oxygen deprivation; they’ve already decided and are\nalready committed to turning around.\nThe path to success and failure is marked if you know where to\nlook. The journey always contains the answers. Trip wires include\nboth negative signs and the absence of positive signs. When the\nsigns are positive, you know to stay the course. When things are\nmurkier, however, that’s when it helps to set trip wires.\nNegative signs are red ﬂags that something is going seriously oﬀ\ncourse. The sooner you catch yourself going the wrong way, the\neasier it is to turn back. The other day I ended up going east on the\nhighway when I wanted to go west. Only when I noticed the wrong\ncity was getting closer did I realize my mistake! But negative signs\naren’t the only ones to take note of. Sometimes the absence of\npositive signs is itself a sign.\nWhen you don’t see the positive signs you expected, it doesn’t\nnecessarily mean things have gone wrong. It does mean this is a\nmoment worth paying attention to. Many projects fail, and many\ndecisions get challenging right at this point—when people see\nneither negative signs nor the positive ones they expected. When\nthat happens, it’s time to re-evaluate. Ask yourself, “Is the most\nimportant thing still the most important thing? Was I wrong? What\nwill it take to reach my goals now that I’ve moved further in time\nbut not in progress?”\nBy having clear trip wires in place before you start, you increase\nthe odds of success. When the entire team understands clearly the\nmarkers of success and failure, they are empowered to act the\nminute things veer oﬀ course.\nfail-safe: Use commander’s intent to empower others to act and make\ndecisions without you.\nGreat leaders know that things don’t always go according to plan.\n\f\nThey also know they can’t be everywhere at once. Teams need to\nknow how to adapt when circumstances change. And circumstances\nchange all the time.\nGiving a team enough structure to carry out a mission but\nenough ﬂexibility to respond to changing circumstances is called\ncommander’s intent—a military term ﬁrst applied to the Germans\nwho were trying to defeat Napoleon.\nIf you’ve ever been on the inside of a business where employees\ncan’t take action until everything is approved by their boss, you’re\nseeing what happens without commander’s intent. There’s a single\npoint of failure. If something happens to the boss, the business and\nmission fail.\nCommander’s intent empowers each person on a team to initiate\nand improvise as they’re executing the plan. It stops you from being\nthe bottleneck, and it enables the team to keep each other\naccountable to the goal without your presence.\nCommander’s intent has four components: formulate,\ncommunicate, interpret, and implement. The ﬁrst two components\n—formulate and communicate—are the responsibility of the senior\ncommander. You must communicate the strategy, the rationale, and\nthe operational limits to the team. Tell them not just what to do,\nbut why to do it, how you arrived at your decision, so they\nunderstand the context, as well as the boundaries for eﬀective\naction—what is completely oﬀ the table. Subordinate commanders\nthen have the tools for the last two components: interpreting the\nchanging contexts and implementing the strategy in those contexts.\nBefore you begin executing a decision, just so there’s no\nconfusion as you move forward, ask yourself:\n•  Who needs to know my goals and the outcomes I’m working\ntoward?\n•  Do they know what the most important objective is?\n•  Do they know the positive and negative signs to look for and\nwhat trip wires are attached to them?\nOne sign that you’ve failed to empower your team is that you can’t\nbe away from the oﬃce for a week without things falling apart.\n\f\nSome leaders think it makes them indispensable—that the team’s\ninability to function without them is a sign of how important they\nare. Don’t be fooled! This is the ego default at work. Eﬀective\nleaders shouldn’t have to be available 24/7 for their team to make\ndecisions and achieve objectives. If you can’t be away, it doesn’t\nmean that you’re indispensable or a supremely competent leader; it\nmeans that you’re an incompetent communicator.\nAnother sign that you’re in the grips of the ego default is that\nyou insist on controlling how everything happens. Good leaders\ndetermine what needs to get done and set the parameters for\ngetting there. They don’t care whether something gets done\ndiﬀerently from how they themselves would’ve done it. As long as it\nadvances to the objective within the limits they’ve set, they’re\nsatisﬁed.\nPoor leaders insist that everything must be done their way,\nwhich ultimately demoralizes their team and undermines both\nloyalty and creativity—exactly the opposite of commander’s intent.\nfail-safe: Tie your hands to keep your execution on track.\nUlysses used trip wires and commander’s intent to safeguard his\ndecision. He also had the crew tie his hands—a ﬁnal execution fail-\nsafe to ensure he followed through with his decision, and the reason\nthis kind of safeguard is known as a Ulysses pact.\nTying your hands amounts to diﬀerent things in diﬀerent\ncontexts. If you’re dieting, tying your hands might mean ridding\nyour home of all junk food so there’s nothing to tempt you. If you’re\ninvesting, it might mean creating automated deposits each month. If\nyou’re climbing Everest, tying your hands might mean securing an\nagreement from everyone that the team will turn around if they\ndon’t reach the halfway point by a certain time.\nWhatever decision you’re facing, ask yourself, “Is there a way to\nmake sure I will stick to the path I’ve decided is best?” By thinking\nthrough your options, and precommitting to courses of action, you\nfree up space to tackle other problems.\nEven if we’re waiting as long as possible to decide, we now know\n\f\nexactly what to focus on and do when the time comes to make our\ndecision. We’ve set our trip wires, we’ve empowered people to act\non them, and we’ve tied our hands so that we can’t undo all our\ngood work in a moment of stress."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 4.6\nLearn from Your Decisions\nIf you’re a knowledge worker, you produce decisions.[1] That’s your\njob. The quality of your decisions eventually determines how far\nyou go and how fast you get there. If you learn to make great\ndecisions consistently, you’ll quickly move past the people whose\ndecisions are merely good.\nNo one is smart enough to make great decisions without learning\nﬁrst, though. Great decision-makers have mastered the ability to\nlearn both from their mistakes and from their successes. It’s that\nability that sets them apart. It enables them to repeat their successes\nand avoid repeating their failures. Unless you develop that ability\nyourself, you won’t improve your decision-making process over\ntime.\nA few years ago, a ﬁrm engaged me to help them improve the\nquality of their decisions. As a ﬁrst step, we needed to ﬁnd out\nwhere they were at. We started by trying to answer a single\nquestion: When their decision-makers expected a particular result,\nhow often did that result happen for the reasons they thought it\nwould?\nWhat we discovered shocked them: Their decision-makers were\nright only about 20 percent of the time. Most of the time when\nsomething that they anticipated actually happened, it didn’t happen\nfor the reasons they thought it would. Their success, in other words,\nwasn’t due to insight or eﬀort or skill. It was more luck than skill.\nThis news was a blow to their egos. They thought that the successes\nthey enjoyed resulted largely from their abilities, but the numbers\ntold a diﬀerent story. They were like people getting lucky at\nroulette and attributing their success to having a “system.”\n\f\nThe story illustrates a psychological phenomenon we’ve\ndiscussed before: self-serving bias, the tendency to evaluate things in\nways that enhance our self-image. When we succeed at something,\nwe tend to attribute our success to our ability or eﬀort. By contrast,\nwhen we fail at something, we tend to attribute our failure to\nexternal factors. Basically, heads I’m right. Tails, I’m not wrong. If\nyou want to get better, you have to rewrite the faulty narratives.\nSelf-serving bias gets in the way of learning from your decisions\nand improving your process. Our ego default wants us to think that\nwe’re smarter than we are and tells us that we work harder and\nknow more than we actually do. The overconﬁdence that the ego\ndemon inspires prevents us from examining our decisions with a\ncritical eye. It keeps us from distinguishing skill from luck—what’s\nin our control from what isn’t. If you get trapped by the demon,\nyou’ll never learn from your decisions and never get better at\nmaking them in the future.\nThe ﬁrst principle to keep in mind when evaluating your\ndecisions is this:\nthe process principle: When you evaluate a decision, focus on the\nprocess you used to make the decision and not the outcome.\nConventional wisdom suggests that good outcomes result from good\npeople making good decisions and bad outcomes result from bad\npeople making bad decisions. But it’s easy to ﬁnd counterexamples.\nWe’ve all made bad decisions, yet we’re not all bad people. And\neven good decisions can have unexpected and unfortunate\noutcomes thanks to the necessary uncertainty of life.\nCoach Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks understands the\ndiﬀerence between good decisions and good outcomes as well as\nanyone. In February 2015, Carroll made a historic call in the ﬁnal\nminutes of Super Bowl XLIX that was immediately criticized as a\nhuge mistake. The Seahawks trailed 28–24, but they were on New\nEngland’s one-yard line and appeared certain to score and take the\nlead. Lined up in Seattle’s backﬁeld was Marshawn Lynch, a 215-\npound battering ram who was arguably the most dominant running\n\f\nback in the NFL at the time, and who’d already run for more than\none hundred yards against the Patriots that day. Here’s a quick\nrecap from a CBS Sports story that explains what happened next—\nand how Carroll’s decisions continue to be viewed today:\nWhat transpired next will live in the annals of this league for\nas long as football games are played . . . a bizarre call by\nCarroll to throw on second down on a route in the crowded\nmiddle of the ﬁeld will be second-guessed just as long—[and\nresulted] in Belichick and Tom Brady, the game’s MVP,\nmaking history with their fourth Super Bowl title together.[2]\nTo the fans in the stands and nearly everyone watching the game,\nthe right decision seemed obvious: just hand the ball to “Beast\nMode,” as Lynch was known to many. But instead Carroll asked\nquarterback Russell Wilson to throw a pass, and the result was a\ndisaster.\nIt’s been years since this play. There’s been a tremendous\namount of analysis of it. Why didn’t the coach make the easy choice\nthat seemed so clear to everyone else? Based on good information,\nhe was betting against his opponent’s weaknesses. After the game,\nan interviewer told Carroll, “Everyone is thinking this was the\ngreatest mistake of all time.” Carroll’s response: it was the “worst\nresult of a call ever.” His decision-making process was sound. It just\ndidn’t work out. Sometimes that’s life.\nThe right call doesn’t always get the intended outcome. Sooner\nor later everyone who makes decisions in the real world learns this\nlesson. Poker players know it. They can play their hand perfectly\nand still lose. Nothing is guaranteed. All you can do is play the\nhand you’re dealt as best you can.\nCarroll made his decision on the biggest stage in the world, and\nit had a terrible outcome. But his conﬁdence in the decision was\nunwavering. Why? Because he knew the reasons why he had made\nthe call. He knew his logic was sound. All he could do was learn\nfrom the outcome.\nMany people assume that good decisions get good outcomes and\nbad ones don’t. But that’s not true. The quality of a single decision\n\f\nisn’t determined by the quality of the outcome. Here’s a thought\nexperiment that will help illuminate this concept.\nImagine you engage in a very thoughtful and intentional\ndecision-making process concerning your career. You have oﬀers\nfrom a few diﬀerent companies, one being a startup and another a\nFortune 500. Based on where you are in your life, you decide to go\nwith the Fortune 500 company. The pay is less up front, but it\nappears to be more stable.\nImagine your friend ends up working for the startup. You watch\nas he gets raises and more vacation time. Is your decision good or\nbad?\nNow, imagine the startup quickly folds after only a year. Does\nthis aﬀect how you feel about your decision?\nI hope you get where I’m going with this. You can’t control\nwhether the startup takes oﬀ or not. Nor can you control in the\nmoment how you feel about the startup oﬀering higher pay. You\ncan only control the process you use to make the decision. It’s that\nprocess that determines whether a decision is good or bad. The\nquality of the outcome is a separate issue.\nOur tendency to equate the quality of our decision with the\noutcome is called resulting. Results are the most visible part of a\ndecision. Because of that, we tend to use them as an indicator of the\ndecision’s quality. If the results are what we wanted, we conclude\nthat we made a good decision. If the results aren’t what we wanted,\nwe tend to blame external factors. It’s not that our process was\nlacking; it’s that a crucial bit of information was. (As opposed to\nwhen an acquaintance gets bad results, at which point we assume\nit’s because they made a bad decision.)\nObviously, we all want good outcomes, but as we’ve seen, good\ndecisions can have bad outcomes, and bad decisions can have good\nones. Evaluating decisions—ours or others’—based on the outcome\n(or how we feel about the outcome) fails to distinguish luck from\nskill and control. Because of that, engaging in resulting doesn’t help\nus get better. The result of resulting is instead stagnation.\nIf you’ve ever ruminated over a bad outcome—asking yourself\nagain and again, “How did I not see that coming?”—then you’ve\nexperienced how challenging and ultimately useless it is to judge\n\f\nyour decisions on the basis of how you feel about them in\nretrospect. You think, “If only I had talked to that person (whom I\ndidn’t know at the time)!” or, “If I had only known that piece of\ninformation (which didn’t exist at the time), I would have made the\nright choice.” Even the best decision-makers get bad results from\ntime to time, though.\nMaking a good decision is about the process, not the outcome.\nOne bad outcome doesn’t make you a poor decision-maker any\nmore than one good outcome makes you a genius. Unless you\nevaluate your reasoning at the time you made the decision, you’ll\nnever know whether you were correct or just lucky. Your reasoning\nat that time remains mostly invisible unless you take steps to make\nit visible.\nRarely are you making decisions that have a 100 percent chance\nof success. And the kind of decision that has a 90 percent chance of\nsuccess still has a bad outcome 10 percent of the time. What\nmatters are results over time and ensuring that 10 percent of the\ntime won’t kill you.\nThe following matrix provides a way of organizing your\nreﬂection on decisions and their outcomes.\nGood outcomeBad outcome\nGood processYou make a good decision and things go as planned. You deserve the success\nyou enjoy—you earned it. Don’t let it go to your head. Stay on track and continue\nimproving your process.\nYou make a good decision, but things don’t go as planned. Bad luck! Don’t get\ndiscouraged. Trust the process. Learn from the experience and continue\nimproving.\nBad processYou make a bad decision but get lucky—like winning at roulette. Your success is\nundeserved. You did nothing to earn it. You just got lucky. Eventually you’re going\nto lose. Change while you can. Grow up and take command of your decision-\nmaking.\nYou make a bad decision and are unlucky—like losing at roulette. You deserve\nfailure. You earned it. Now learn from it. Let this be a wake-up call. Change while\nyou can. Grow up and take command of your decision-making.\nA bad process can never produce a good decision. Sure, it might\nresult in a good outcome, but that’s diﬀerent from making a good\ndecision. Outcomes are inﬂuenced in part by luck—both good and\nbad. Getting the right result for the wrong reasons isn’t a function\nof smarts or skills, but just blind luck.\nDon’t get me wrong: it’s nice to get lucky (provided you know\nit’s luck). But luck isn’t a repeatable process that secures good\nresults over the long term. Luck isn’t something you can learn, and\nit isn’t something you can get better at. Luck won’t give you an\n\f\nedge.\nWhen you start equating luck with will, you’re bound to make\nmistakes. You blind yourself to the risks you’re taking, and are\nbound to be badly surprised sooner or later. And when you start\nconfusing luck with skill, you’re bound to squander opportunities to\nlearn from your decisions, to improve your process, and to secure\nbetter results over the long term.\nA second principle for evaluating your decisions in retrospect is\nthis:\nthe transparency principle: Make your decision-making process as\nvisible and open to scrutiny as possible.\nEvaluating other people’s decisions is diﬀerent from evaluating our\nown. We rarely see other people’s intentions, thinking, or process,\nso it’s hard judging their decisions by reference to anything other\nthan their outcomes.\nEvaluating our own decisions is diﬀerent. We can have ﬁrst-\nperson insight into the process itself. We can examine our thinking,\ndistinguish what was within our control from what wasn’t, and\nwhat we knew at the time from what we didn’t. We can then take\nwhat we’ve learned and invest it back into our process for next\ntime. Of course, this is easier said than done!\nMany of us have a hard time learning from our decisions. One\nreason is that our thinking and decision-making process is often\ninvisible to us. We inadvertently conceal from ourselves the steps\nwe took to reach our ﬁnal decision. Once that decision gets made,\nwe don’t stop to reﬂect, but just move forward. And when we look\nback at our decision later, our ego manipulates our memories. We\nconfuse what we know now with what we knew at the time we\nmade the decision. And we see the outcomes and read them back\ninto our intentions: “Oh, I meant to do that.”\nIf you don’t check your thinking at the time you made the\ndecision—what you knew, what you thought was important, and\nhow you reasoned about it—you’ll never know whether you made a\ngood decision or just got lucky. If you want to learn from decisions,\n\f\nyou need to make the invisible thought process as visible and open\nto scrutiny as possible. The following safeguard can help:\nsafeguard: Keep a record of your thoughts at the time you make the\ndecision. Don’t rely on your memory after the fact. Trying to recall what you\nknew and thought at the time you made the decision is a fool’s game.\nYour ego works to distort your memories and convinces you of\nnarratives that make you feel smarter or more knowledgeable than\nyou really are. No one, we think, could make better decisions than\nthe ones we’ve made ourselves. The only way to see clearly what\nyou were thinking at the time you made the decision is to keep a\nrecord of your thoughts at the time you were making the decision.\nWriting down your thoughts oﬀers several beneﬁts. One beneﬁt\nis that a written record provides information about your thought\nprocess at the time you made the decision. It makes the invisible\nvisible. Later, when you reﬂect on your decision, having that record\nis helpful for counteracting the distorting eﬀects of the ego default.\nYou can truthfully answer questions like, “What did I know at the\ntime I made the decision?” and, “Did the things I anticipated\nhappening come about for the reasons I thought they would?”\nA second beneﬁt of recording your thoughts is that in the process\nof writing something, you often realize you don’t really understand\nit as well as you thought you did. It’s far better (and cheaper) to\nrealize this before making your decision instead of after. If you do\nso in advance, you have an opportunity to get more information\nand a better grasp of the problem.\nA third beneﬁt to writing down your thoughts is that it allows\nother people to see your thinking, which is mostly invisible. And if\nthey can see it, they can check it for errors and oﬀer a diﬀerent\nperspective that you might otherwise be blind to. If you can’t\nsimply explain your thinking to other people (or yourself), it’s a\nsign that you don’t fully understand things and need to dig deeper\nand gather more information.\nA ﬁnal beneﬁt to writing down your thoughts is that it gives\nother people an opportunity to learn from your perspective. Many\n\f\norganizations would beneﬁt from having a database that recorded\nhow every person in the organization went about making decisions.\nImagine the value of a searchable catalog of decisions in your\norganization. A system like this would allow people in diﬀerent\nparts of the organization to check each other’s thinking. It would\nallow management to distinguish good decision-makers from\nmediocre ones, and it would provide people with models of\ndecision-making—both of how to do it and of how not to. If you\nbuild a system like this, I want an equity cut!\nAll of these principles will help you get what you want but not\nhelp you want what matters.\n\f\nPART 5\nWANTING WHAT MATTERS\nThink of yourself as dead. You have lived your\nlife. Now take what’s left and live it properly.\n—MARCUS AURELIUS, Meditations, Book 7\nGOOD DECISION-MAKING COMES down to two things:\n1. Knowing how to get what you want\n2. Knowing what’s worth wanting\nThe ﬁrst point is about making eﬀective decisions. The second is\nabout making good ones. You might think they’re the same, but they\nare not.\nDecisions that bring immediate results, like closing a sale or ﬁlling\na vacancy, may be eﬀective, but they don’t necessarily lead to the\nthings that truly matter in life, like trust, love, and health. Good\ndecisions, on the other hand, align with your long-term goals and\nvalues, and ultimately bring you the satisfaction and fulﬁllment that\nyou truly desire in business, relationships, and life.[*]\nEﬀective decisions get you the ﬁrst outcome, while good ones get\nyou the ultimate outcome.\nAll good decisions are eﬀective, but not all eﬀective decisions are\ngood. Making the best judgments comes down to making decisions\nthat get you what you really want—beyond just what you think you\nwant at the moment.\nIn life, we experience regret over both things we’ve done and\nthings we’ve failed to do. The worst regret is when we fail to live a\nlife true to ourselves, when we fail to play by our own scoreboard.\n\f\nEach default plays a role in setting us up for regret. The social\ndefault prompts us to inherit goals from other people, even if their\nlife circumstances are very diﬀerent from ours. The inertia default\nencourages us to continue pursuing the goals we’ve pursued in the\npast, even after we’ve come to realize that achieving them doesn’t\nmake us happy. The emotion default sends us this way and that,\nchasing whatever captures our fancy in the moment, even at the\nexpense of pursuing long-term goals that matter more. And the ego\ndefault convinces us to pursue things like wealth, status, and power,\neven at the expense of happiness and well-being—our own and that\nof the people around us.\nIf you give any of the defaults command of your life, your ultimate\ndestination is regret. Don’t live life by another person’s scoreboard.\nDon’t let someone else choose your objectives in life. Take\nresponsibility for where you are and where you are headed.\nReal wisdom doesn’t come from chasing success but from\nbuilding character. As Jim Collins wrote, “There is no eﬀectiveness\nwithout discipline, and there is no discipline without character.”[1]\n⦁\n\f\nCHAPTER 5.1\nDickens’s Hidden Lesson\nEbenezer Scrooge is one of Charles Dickens’s most memorable\ncharacters—an embodiment of greed and pursuing wealth at the\nexpense of everything else. Scrooge is visited by three spirits who\nshow him images of the past, the present, and a future that might\nbe. In that future, Scrooge is dead, and the spirit allows him to\neavesdrop on people’s conversations about him: they’re pleased\nScrooge is gone, spiteful at his memory, unrepentant about stealing\nhis things, and relieved that he’s no longer a presence—a curse—in\ntheir lives. Scrooge sees the long-term consequences of the decisions\nhe’s made, regrets them, begs for a second chance, and gets an\nopportunity to change course.[*]\nScrooge played by society’s scoreboard—the one that ampliﬁes\nour biological instinct toward hierarchy and leads us to pursue\nmoney, status, and power at all costs. But his vision of the long-\nterm future made him realize that none of these things really\nmattered, that a life lived according to someone else’s scoreboard is\nnot a life worth living. He realized before it was too late that the\nkey to a successful life is good company and meaningful\nrelationships.\nThe quality of what you pursue determines the quality of your\nlife. We think things like money, status, and power will make us\nhappy, but they won’t. The moment we get them, we’re not\nsatisﬁed. We just want more. The psychologists Philip Brickman and\nDonald T. Campbell coined a term for this phenomenon: the hedonic\ntreadmill.[1] Who hasn’t taken a run on it?\nRemember when you were sixteen, and thought that if you just\nhad a car, you’d be happy for the rest of your life? Then you got a\n\f\ncar. For a week or two you were euphoric. You showed the car oﬀ\nto all your friends and drove it everywhere. You thought life was\namazing. Then reality set in. Cars come with problems. In addition\nto paying for insurance, gas, and maintenance, there’s also the\nproblem of comparison. Back when you didn’t have a car, you used\nto compare yourself with other people who didn’t have cars. But\nnow that you had a car, you began comparing yourself with other\ncar owners. You noticed who had a better car, and were no longer\nhappy with what had once made you ecstatic. You reverted to your\nold base-level discontent—the lowest gear on the hedonic treadmill.\nComparison is the thief of joy.[*]\nSocial comparison happens all the time. Sometimes it’s about\npossessions like houses or cars, but more often it’s about status.\nWhen I ﬁrst started working in a large organization, the inner\nvoice in my head told me that if I just got a promotion, I’d be\nhappy. So I worked hard and got the promotion. For a few weeks I\nfelt on top of the world. Then, much like with the car example,\nreality set in. I had new problems and new responsibilities. Worse, I\nstarted comparing myself with a new group of people. It wasn’t long\nbefore I reverted to my previous level of discontent. Promotions\ncontinued to come, but none of them made me happier. They only\nleft me wanting more.\nWe tell ourselves that the next level is enough, but it never is.\nThe next zero in your bank account won’t satisfy you any more than\nyou are satisﬁed now. The next promotion won’t change who you\nare. The fancy car won’t make you happier. The bigger house\ndoesn’t solve your problems. More social media followers won’t\nmake you a better person.\nRunning on the hedonic treadmill only turns us into what I call\n“happy-when” people—those who think they’ll be happy when\nsomething happens. For example, we’ll be happy when we get the\ncredit we deserve, or happy when we make a bit more money, or\nhappy when we ﬁnd that special someone. Happiness, however,\nisn’t conditional.\nHappy-when people are never actually happy. The moment they\nget what they think they want—the “when” part of the conditional\n—having that thing becomes the new norm, and they automatically\n\f\nwant more. It’s as if they’ve walked through a one-way door that\ncloses behind them. Once the door closes, they lose perspective.\nThey can’t see where they’ve been, only where they are.\nThe way things are now is the way we expect them to be, and we\nstart taking the good things around us for granted. Once that\nhappens, nothing will make us happy. And while we’re busy\nrunning on the treadmill chasing after all the things that won’t\nmake us happy, we’re not pursuing the things that really matter.\nScrooge is a ﬁctional example of achieving “success” at the cost\nof things that really matter. But there are many real examples. I\nonce worked with someone who came to his position running a\nlarge company in a way that should be familiar to most of us: with\nsharp elbows in a hypercompetitive culture. The people he ran into\non the way to becoming CEO were only means to help him achieve\nhis ends: he wanted to be wealthy, he wanted to be respected, he\nwanted people to know his name. He wanted status and\nrecognition.\nAfter meetings, where things were tense and his temper got the\nbetter of him, he would often tell me, “Shane, you’ve got to decide\nif you’re a lion or a sheep. I’m a lion,” he’d say, and quote Tywin\nLannister from Game of Thrones: “A lion doesn’t concern himself\nwith the opinions of a sheep.” He wanted everyone to know he was\nat the top of the food chain.\nAn avid golfer, he often enjoyed several games a week. He never\nhad trouble ﬁlling a round; in fact, he often complained that he had\ntoo many friends and couldn’t play with them all. Shortly after\nretiring, he looked forward to ﬁnally having the time to enjoy his\nfavorite pastime with his many friends. As it turned out, though,\nmost of his “friends” and colleagues were busy, unavailable, or\nstopped returning his calls. He could hardly ﬁll a single round a\nmonth.\nHis relationships had appeared real and meaningful, but in\nreality, no one wanted anything to do with him. His transactional\nway of handling other people made them feel used, manipulated,\nand frustrated. He yelled, cursed, and threw temper tantrums. They\nworked with him because they had to, not because they wanted to.\nGolﬁng was fun for him, but it was work for them."

    "raw_text": "A while after stepping away, he concluded that he’d been trying\nto win the wrong game. He’d aimed at achieving wealth, power,\nand prominence—the goals so many people tell us to pursue. He’d\nprioritized these goals above all others and pursued them\nrelentlessly. In the end, he got what he thought he wanted. But it\nleft him feeling empty. He achieved what he’d wanted at the\nexpense of having meaningful relationships—which, he came to\nrealize, was something that really mattered. Unlike Scrooge, he got\nno second chance.\nHow many of us—at whatever stages of our careers—are on the\nsame trajectory? We value wealth and status more than happiness—\nthe external more than the internal—and we give little thought to\nhow we pursue them. In the process, we end up chasing praise and\nrecognition from people who don’t matter at the expense of people\nwho do.\nI’ve known many successful people whose lives I wouldn’t want\nto have. They had intelligence, they had drive, they had\nopportunity, and the wherewithal to use them all. But they were\nmissing something else. They knew how to get what they wanted,\nbut the things they wanted weren’t worth wanting. In fact, the\nthings they wanted ended up disﬁguring their lives. They were\nmissing what Scrooge gains at the happy turning point of his story\n—that ingredient that makes the diﬀerence between the unhappy\nmasses and the happy few.\nThe ancient Greeks had a word for this ingredient: phronesis—the\nwisdom of knowing how to order your life to achieve the best\nresults.\nWhen you look back to the decisions you made as a teenager,\nthey probably seem pretty silly now. The time you stole (I mean\nborrowed) the car from your parents, the time you got too drunk at\na party and maybe did some stuﬀ you shouldn’t have (thankfully\nthere were no camera phones back then), the time you got into a\nﬁght with a friend over a potential mate. These decisions didn’t\nseem stupid at the time so why do they appear so now? Because\nyou have perspective now that was inaccessible to you back then.\nWhat seemed like the most important thing in the world at the time\n—the very thing that consumed you—seems silly now in hindsight.\n\f\nWisdom requires all the things we’ve talked about: the ability to\nkeep the defaults in check, to create space for reason and reﬂection,\nto use the principles and safeguards that make for eﬀective\ndecisions. But being wise requires more. It’s more than knowing\nhow to get what you want. It’s also knowing which things are worth\nwanting—which things really matter. It’s as much about saying no\nas saying yes. We can’t copy the life decisions of other people and\nexpect better results. If we want to live the best life we can, we\nneed a diﬀerent approach.\nKnowing what to want is the most important thing. Deep down,\nyou already know what to do, you just need to follow your own\nadvice. Sometimes, it’s the advice we give other people that we\nmost need to follow ourselves."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 5.2\nThe Happiness Experts\nI once interviewed the gerontologist Karl Pillemer, author of 30\nLessons for Living: Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans.[1]\nHe’d seen numerous studies showing that people in their seventies,\neighties, and beyond were happier than younger people. He was\nintrigued: “I kept meeting older people—many of whom had lost\nloved ones, been through tremendous diﬃculties, and had serious\nhealth problems—but who nevertheless were happy, fulﬁlled, and\ndeeply enjoying life. I found myself asking: ‘What’s that all about?’ ”\nOne day it hit him: Maybe older people just knew things about\nliving a happy life that younger people didn’t. Maybe they could see\nthings we couldn’t see. If any population demographic could lay\nclaim to expertise in living a happy life, it would be seniors. Yet to\nPillemer’s surprise, no one seemed to have done a study on what\npractical advice older people had for the younger generation. That\nset Pillemer oﬀ on a seven-year quest to discover “the practical\nwisdom of older people.”\nTheir number one lesson: life is short! “The older the\nrespondent,” Pillemer said, “the more likely [they were] to say that\nlife passes by in what seems like an instant.” When elders tell\nyounger people that life is short, they’re not being macabre or\npessimistic. They’re instead trying to oﬀer a perspective that they\nhope will inspire better decisions—ones that prioritize the things\nthat really matter. “I wish I’d learned this in my 30s instead of in\nmy 60s,” one man told Pillemer, “I would have had so much more\ntime to enjoy life.” If only we could turn our future hindsight into\nour current foresight.\nTime is the ultimate currency of life. The implications of\n\f\nmanaging the short time we have on earth are like those of\nmanaging any scarce resource: you have to use it wisely—in a way\nthat prioritizes what’s most important.\nWhat were the most important things according to the people\nPillemer interviewed? They included the following:\n•  Say things now to people you care about—whether it’s\nexpressing gratitude, asking forgiveness, or getting information.\n•  Spend the maximum amount of time with your children.\n•  Savor daily pleasures instead of waiting for “big-ticket items” to\nmake you happy.\n•  Work in a job you love.\n•  Choose your mate carefully; don’t just rush in.\nThe list of things they said weren’t important was equally revealing:\n•  None said that to be happy you should work as hard as you can\nto get money.\n•  None said it was important to be as wealthy as the people\naround you.\n•  None said you should choose your career based on its earning\npotential.\n•  None said they regretted not getting even with someone who\nslighted them.\nAnd the biggest regret people had? Worrying about things that\nnever happened: “Worrying wastes your life,” one respondent said.\nThese are important insights from the people that Pillemer\ndescribes as “the most credible experts we have on how to live\nhappy and fulﬁlled lives during hard times.” But there’s another\ninsight that’s even more important.\nPillemer asked one of his interviewees for help understanding\nthe source of her happiness. She thought about it and answered, “In\nmy 89 years, I’ve learned that happiness is a choice—not a\ncondition.”\nAccording to Pillemer, “The elders make the key distinction\nbetween events that happen to us, on the one hand, and our\n\f\ninternal attitude toward happiness, on the other. Happy in spite of.\nHappiness is not a passive condition dependent on external events,\nnor is it the result of our personalities—just being born a happy\nperson. Instead, happiness requires a conscious shift in outlook, in\nwhich one chooses—daily—optimism over pessimism, hope over\ndespair.”\nThe more we age, the more we come to see things the way\nMarcus Aurelius did: “When you are distressed by an external thing,\nit’s not the thing itself that troubles you, but only your judgment of\nit. And you can wipe this out at a moment’s notice.”[2]\nThis insight has dramatic implications. It places happiness on a\ncontinuum with other decisions we’ve talked about. Imagine that:\nall the decisions that make up your career and personal life\nultimately add up to an overall decision to be happy. You can\ndecide what to pursue in life. You can decide what’s a priority for\nyou. You can decide to channel your time, energy, and other\nresources toward things that really matter in the end.\nIf there were a way of viewing things from the perspective of our\nelders, we might have the insight to live better lives—to see in the\nway the experts do what really matters and what doesn’t. In fact,\nthere’s an ancient technique for doing precisely this: start thinking\nabout the shortness of life, and it will help you see what really\nmatters.\n“Let us prepare our minds as if we had come to the very end of\nlife,” Seneca said. If you want a better life, start thinking about\ndeath."

    "raw_text": "CHAPTER 5.3\nMemento Mori\nLet’s do a thought experiment.\nClear your mind. Imagine you’re eighty years old and nearing\nthe end of your life. Maybe you have a couple years left, maybe just\na couple hours. You’re sitting on a park bench on a beautiful fall\nday overlooking a river. You hear the birds migrating above, the\nwater ﬂowing in the river, and the leaves falling oﬀ trees and\ngliding gently to the ground. Families are walking by, with parents\nholding the hands of their toddlers.\nTake as long as you want. There is no rush.\nNow think deeply. What’s going on in the life you’re imagining?\nWho are the people in it? In what ways have you inﬂuenced them?\nWhat have you done for them? How have you made them feel?\nWhat are the things you’ve accomplished? What possessions do you\nhave? What matters most as you approach your ﬁnal days? What\nseems unimportant? What memories do you cherish? What are the\nthings you regret? What do your friends say about you? What about\nyour family?\nShifting our perspective to the end of life can help us gain insight\ninto what really matters. It can help us become wiser. When we\nlook back at the present through the lens of our life ending, the\nfears and desires that occupy our attention in the present moment\nget pushed aside to make room for things that have greater\nmeaning for our lives as a whole. Steve Jobs put the idea this way:\nRemembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool\nI’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.\nBecause almost everything—all external expectations, all\n\f\npride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just\nfall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly\nimportant. Remembering that you are going to die is the best\nway I know to avoid the trap of thinking that you have\nsomething to lose.[1]\nThis shift in our perspective allows us to turn our future hindsight\ninto our current foresight. It gives us a map we can use to navigate\ninto the future. For many of us, looking at life this way reveals that\nour current direction isn’t fully aligned with where we want to end\nup. Seeing that is a good thing! Knowing you’re heading in the\nwrong direction is the ﬁrst step toward getting back on course.\nWhen you get clear on what really matters, you can start asking\nyourself, “Am I making the right use of my limited time?”[2]\nJobs had a daily ritual. Every morning he would look in the\nmirror and ask himself, “If today were the last day of my life, would\nI want to do what I am about to do today?”[3] Whenever the answer\nwas no too many days in a row, he said, he knew he needed to\nchange something. At one point in my own life, I began performing\nthe same ritual. It was part of the reason I eventually decided to\nleave the intelligence agency. We all have bad days, but when the\nanswer to Job’s question is no day after day, week after week, it’s\ntime to make a change.\nWhen you did this exercise, you probably thought of your\nrelationships. Maybe it was the time you and your spouse cried on\nthe couch together, had a romantic weekend, or walked along a\nbeach holding hands. Maybe it was your wedding. Or maybe it was\na time you experienced pure joy with your kids. Maybe it was the\ntime you were there for a friend or the time they were there for\nyou.\nOr perhaps your mind went toward your regrets—the\nopportunities you could have taken but didn’t: the dreams you\ndidn’t chase, the business you didn’t start, the love you didn’t leap\nat, the trip you didn’t go on, the way you held yourself back\nbecause you didn’t want to get hurt, the time you were scared to do\nsomething diﬀerent because you might look like a fool.\nJeﬀ Bezos uses a similar thought experiment:\n\f\nI wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, “Okay,\nnow I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized\nthe number of regrets I have.” . . . I knew that when I was 80\nI was not going to regret having tried [Amazon]. I was not\ngoing to regret trying to participate in this thing called the\nInternet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I\nknew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one\nthing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that\nwould haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it\nthat way it was an incredibly easy decision.[4]\nWe regret the things we didn’t do more than the things we did. The\npain of trying and failing may be intense but at least it tends to be\nover rather quickly. The pain of failing to try, on the other hand, is\nless intense but never really goes away.[5]\nPossessions become less important for what they are than for\nwhat they enable. I’m guessing that, in the thought exercise, you\ndidn’t think of your house as an investment. If it came to mind, it\nwas probably in the context of the relationships and the memories\n—the family dinners, the laughs, the tears, the parties, the time you\nstayed in bed all day with your partner, the board game battles, the\nmarks in the doorway that recorded how tall your kids were at each\nage.\nI’m guessing you didn’t think of the time you watched Breaking\nBad, The Mandalorian, or The Bachelor. You probably didn’t think of\nall the time you spent commuting and the extra podcasts or\naudiobooks you got to listen to. Perhaps you thought instead about\nhow at least some of that time could have been used connecting\nwith family and friends, or writing that book you always wanted to\nwrite.\nYou might remember the times you fell short of the person you\nwanted to be—we all have done so at one point or another. Perhaps\nit was the time you sent an inappropriate email, or the time you lost\ncontrol of your emotions and yelled at someone you love. Maybe it\nwas the time you said something you didn’t mean just to cause a\nreaction in the other person because you didn’t know how, in that\nmoment, to tell them you loved them or how scared you were. Or\n\f\nperhaps it was the time someone said they needed you, and you\nwere too busy with your own priorities to help.\nYou might think of the impact—or lack of it—that you had on\nyour community, your city, your country, or the world. You might\nthink of your health. Did you do everything you could to prepare\nyour body to live to eighty, ninety, one hundred? Did you take care\nof yourself so you could take care of others?\nWhat we think of as deﬁning moments, like promotions or a new\nhouse, matter less to life satisfaction than the accumulation of tiny\nmoments that didn’t seem to matter at the time. In the end,\neveryday moments matter more than big prizes. Tiny delights over\nbig bright lights.\n\f\nCHAPTER 5.4\nLife Lessons from Death\nIt is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.\n—SENECA, On the Shortness of Life, Chapter 1\nEvaluating your life through the lens of your death is raw, powerful,\nand perhaps a bit scary. What matters most becomes clear. We\nbecome aware of the gap between who we are and who we want to\nbe. We see where we are and where we want to go. Without that\nclarity, we lack wisdom and waste the present on things that don’t\nmatter.\nWhen I do this thought experiment, I gain a more objective\nperspective on my life. It makes me want to become a better version\nof myself.\nInitially, what comes to mind are the things I want to do for\nothers. Was I there when the people I love needed me? Did I make\ntime for the people closest to me? Am I the partner that I want to be\n—loving, supportive, and true to my hopelessly romantic and\ncheesy side? Was I a good father? Did I travel and see the world?\nCould people count on me? Was I an active participant in the\ncommunity? Did I help people accomplish their dreams? Did I leave\nthe world a better place?\nWhen you know the destination, how to get there becomes\nclearer. As Aristotle says, “Knowledge of the best good carries great\nweight for knowing the best way to live: if we know it, then like\narchers who have a target to aim at, we are more likely to hit the\nright mark.”[1]\nAt some point my kids ﬁgured out that it was easier to solve a\nmaze backward than forward, especially if the maze is harder or\n\f\nmore complicated than usual. Something about starting with the\nend in mind, they realized, makes it easier to decide which path to\ntake. Life in general works similarly.\nIf this were your ﬁnal year of life, would you be living the same\nway you are today? I posed this question to a friend of mine over\nlunch one day, and he quickly retorted, “I’d spend my savings, run\nup my credit cards, and start a drug habit.” (He was joking about\nthe drugs. I hope.)\nWhen you think of your ninety-year-old self, it becomes clear\nthat running up your credit card or doing drugs isn’t going to make\nyou happier. For many people, considering death makes us less\nlikely to want to blow money.[2] (The downside of drugs is, I trust,\nself-explanatory.) And I’m sure you wouldn’t spend your ﬁnal year\nchecking email, putting other people down, or trying to show your\nuncle just how right you were that one Thanksgiving when you\nargued about politics.\nWhen you imagine your older self and what you want your life\nto look like in hindsight, you stop thinking about the small things\nthat encourage you to be reactive instead of proactive. You start to\nsee what actually matters to you. The small things look small, and\nthe things that really matter start to look big. From this perspective,\nit’s easier to navigate toward the future you really want. You can\nsee the gap between where you are and where you want to be, and\nchange course if necessary.\nFor instance, after doing this thought experiment, I’ve started\neating better, sleeping more, and exercising regularly. Why?\nBecause in order to live to ninety and do all the things I aspire to, I\nneed to be healthy. Likewise, after doing this thought experiment,\nit’s clear that I want to be a more present father. Hence, I’ve cut\nback on my phone use around the kids and created routines that\nnudge connecting with them: every day when they come home, we\nsit on the couch and talk about the school day. No doubt these are\nsmall changes, but they have a big impact on me and the people\nthat matter.\nAs I stick with the thought experiment, my mind wanders to\nwhat people will say about me after I’m gone, when there is no\nopportunity for me to respond. What will people really say?"

    "raw_text": "Whatever it is, my opportunity to change it is right now—while I\nstill have time.[3] Not all of what people say will be kind, so that\nmeans I have some relationships to repair. I can do that now,\nthough. I can be the bigger person. Why? Because it matters to me.\nWisdom is turning your future hindsight into your current\nforesight. What seems to matter in the moment rarely matters in\nlife, yet what matters in life always matters in the moment.[4]\nWhat seems like winning in the moment is often just a shallow\nvictory. It seems important at the time, but unimportant when you\nview it from the perspective of life as a whole. When we’re not\ngoing in the direction in which we want to end up, we end up\nregretting where we end up. And avoiding regret is a key\ncomponent to life satisfaction.\nGood Judgment and the Good Life\nGood judgment is, above all else, about being eﬀective at achieving\nwhat matters—not what matters in the moment, but what matters\nin life. It’s not about ﬁguring out how to succeed today but\nunderstanding why and how we need to structure our lives with the\nend in mind. Good judgment is, above all else, having wisdom.\nWise people know what’s really valuable. They know better than\nanyone that there’s only one life—no rough draft, no do-over, no\nrestart from an earlier save point. They don’t squander their time\nchasing frivolous ambitions on a hedonic treadmill. They know\nwhat real wealth consists of, and they devote themselves to securing\nit—no matter what the crowd might think or say.\nSometimes the cost of being wise is that other people treat you\nlike a fool. And no wonder: fools can’t see what wise people do.\nWise people see life in all its breadth: work, health, family, friends,\nfaith, and community. They don’t ﬁxate on one part to the\nexclusion of others. They instead know how to harmonize life’s\nvarious parts, and pursue each in proportion to the whole. They\nknow that achieving harmony in that way is what makes life\nmeaningful, admirable, and beautiful.\nIf you want to develop good judgment, start by asking two\nquestions: “What do I want in life? And is what I want actually"

    "raw_text": "CONCLUSION\nThe Value of Clear Thinking\nGood judgment is expensive, but poor judgment will cost you a\nfortune.\nThe overarching message of this book is that there are invisible\ninstincts that conspire against good judgment. Your defaults\nencourage you to react without reasoning—to live unconsciously\nrather than deliberately.\nWhen you revert to defaults, you engage in a game you can’t\nwin. When you live a life run on autopilot, you get bad results. You\nmake things worse. You say things that can’t be unsaid and do\nthings that can’t be undone. You might accomplish your immediate\ngoal, but you fail to realize that you’ve made it harder to achieve\nyour ultimate goals. All of this happens without consciously being\naware you are exercising judgment in the ﬁrst place.\nMost books about thinking focus only on being more rational.\nThey miss the fundamental problem: Most errors in judgment\nhappen when we don’t know we’re supposed to be exercising\njudgment. They happen because our subconscious is driving our\nbehaviors and cutting us out of the process of determining what we\nshould do. You don’t consciously choose to argue with your partner,\nbut you ﬁnd yourself saying hurtful things that can’t be unsaid. You\ndon’t consciously seek money and status at the expense of your\nfamily, but you ﬁnd yourself spending less and less time with the\npeople who matter most in your life. You don’t consciously seek to\ndefend your ideas, but you ﬁnd yourself holding grudges against\nanyone who criticizes you.\nThe key to getting what you want out of life is to identify how\nthe world works and to align yourself with it. Often people think\n\f\nthe world should work diﬀerently than it does, and when they don’t\nget the outcomes they want, they try to wiggle out of responsibility\nby blaming other people or their circumstances.[1] Avoiding\nresponsibility is a recipe for misery, and the opposite of what it\ntakes to cultivate good judgment.\nImproving your judgment, it turns out, is less about\naccumulating tools to enhance your rationality and more about\nimplementing safeguards that make the desired path the path of\nleast resistance. It’s about designing systems when you’re at your\nbest that work for you when you’re at your worst. Those systems\ndon’t eliminate the defaults, but they do help you recognize when\nthey are running the show.\nManaging your defaults requires more than willpower. Defaults\noperate at our subconscious level, so overriding them requires\nharnessing equally powerful forces that pull your subconscious in\nthe right direction: habits, rules, and environment. Overriding your\ndefaults requires implementing safeguards that render the invisible\nvisible and that prevent you from acting too soon. And it requires\ncultivating habits of mind—accountability, knowledge, discipline,\nand conﬁdence—that put you on the right track and keep you there.\nThe small improvements you make in judgment won’t be felt\nuntil they are too large to ignore. Gradually, as the improvements\naccumulate, you will notice that less of your time is spent ﬁxing\nproblems that shouldn’t exist in the ﬁrst place. You’ll notice the\nvarious parts of your life blending harmoniously together, and\nyou’ll notice that you experience less stress and anxiety and more\njoy.\nGood judgment can’t be taught, but it can be learned.\n\f\nAcknowledgments\nThis book is a series of things that I have learned from others. Not\nonly are the insights from others, but the work itself wouldn’t be\nhere without others.\nI want to thank my incredible children, William and Mackenzie.\nNot only have they shown me the world through their endlessly\ncurious eyes, but they’ve given me fertile ground to test these ideas\nin the real world.\nI’m grateful to my parents for their support, encouragement, and\nnever-ending belief in me. Mom and Dad, I love you. There were\nsome challenging times, but we’ll save that for another book. I got\nthrough it because of you. I also want to thank my high school\nEnglish teacher Mr. Duncan, and high school bestie Scott Corkery,\nwhose friendship (and family) forever changed my trajectory.\nAs for the content of the book, there are so many people to thank\nthat I’m sure I will forget a few. Once you put a book out into the\nworld, you can’t change it, so you can ﬁnd an updated list of thanks\nand appreciation at fs.blog.\nI am fortunate to have learned from many people, but perhaps\nno one has taught me more than Peter D. Kaufman. Many of the\nlessons and insights in this book come from our many conversations\nover the years. I am grateful for our friendship.\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buﬀett, Andrew Wilkinson, Chris\nSparling, James Clear, Ryan Holiday, Nir Eyal, Steve Kamb, Michael\nKaumeyer, Morgan Housel, Michael Mauboussin, Alex Duncan, Kat\nCole, Naval Ravikant, Jim Collins, Tobi Lütke, Annie Duke, Diana\nChapman, and Randall Stutman have inﬂuenced my thoughts in\nmeaningful ways. In fact, many of their thoughts have so ﬁrmly\nembedded themselves in me that they are indistinguishable from\nmy own. To the extent you enjoy this book, you should look all of"

This idea that we’re naturally prone to defend our territory is an idea I came\nacross through Robert Ardrey’s book The Territorial Imperative: A Personal\nInquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations, as well as\nconversations with various people. While animals instinctively mark and\ndefend their territory, I believe this biological instinct manifests itself in\nhumans in a deeper and more nuanced way. We instinctively respond when\npeople encroach on not only our physical territory but also our self-image.\nSince we wrap our identity into our jobs, when someone criticizes you at\nwork, it’s akin to an animal walking into your territory.

The pain of failing to try, on the other hand, is less\nintense but never really goes away,” Twitter, January 10, 2019, 10:53 p.m.,\nhttps://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish/status/1083572670677938176.\nBACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 5\nChapter 5.4\n1.

Things have changed since those\ndays. With all the trouble they have recruiting, you can have a\npublic proﬁle now. In fact, while job descriptions are vague, people\noften put the name of the agency they work for in their LinkedIn\nproﬁle now. It’s important to realize when I started, we didn’t exist\n—there was no sign on the building. The idea of having any public\nproﬁle was over a decade away.\n\f\n*Some details of this story have been changed to protect the\nidentity of the person involved. The general trajectory\nremains true.\n\f\n*Thank you, Peter Kaufman, for the many conversations we’ve had\non this that informed my thinking."

    "raw_text": "* A phrase I learned from Brent Beshore.\n\f\n* While this behavior has been around for a while, during the\nCOVID pandemic of 2020, people started calling this quiet quitting.\n\f\n*Perhaps not surprisingly, the simple act of clapping has been used\nand abused by leaders throughout history. Professional clappers,\ncalled a claque, would often be positioned in theaters or opera\nhouses. Claques have been used since at least emperor Nero, whose\nperformances were often applauded by thousands of soldiers. Once\na few people start clapping, our social default takes hold and we\nﬁnd ourselves, much like I did, clapping without knowing why.\n\f\n*Peter Kaufman reminds me of this all the time.\n\f\n*Most people are chasing complexity. They learn the basics enough\nto be average, then look for the secret, shortcut, or hidden\nknowledge. Mastering the basics is the key to being ruthlessly\neﬀective. The basics might seem simple but that doesn’t mean\nthey’re simplistic. The best in the world probably don’t have some\nsecret shortcut or hidden knowledge. They merely understand the\nfundamentals better than others. My favorite example of this is\nWarren Buﬀett’s saying “The ﬁrst rule of investing is to never lose\nmoney.” Despite the lifetime of wisdom behind it, people dismiss it\nas too simple. An exercise in thinking comes from reasoning your\nway to this insight through ﬁrst principles from the ground up.\n\f\n*Hierarchy is a powerful biological instinct.\n\f\n* At the time of this writing, the company’s stock price has had a\nnegative return over the past ten years, a period of massive returns\nof the stock market in general. There is no doubt some luck\ninvolved in my selling at the top.\n\f\n*‡ Some ﬁfty years before Newton published his formulation of the\nlaw, Descartes summed it up like this: “Each thing, as far as is in its\npower, always remains in the same state; and that consequently,\nwhen it is once moved, it always continues to move.”\n\f\n*Removed the word “men” from the quote.\n\f\n* He would go on to become my best friend.\n\f\n*† Sarah Jones Simmer taught me the diﬀerence between kind and\nnice on episode 135 of The Knowledge Project podcast."

    "raw_text": "* The Moral Sayings of Publilius Syrus, 358. I named my investment\ncompany Syrus Partners (syruspartners.com) after him.\n\f\n* I use a version of this on my kids. “Is this behavior moving you\ncloser to what you want or further away?” It’s amazingly eﬀective.\n\f\n* Nothing like a trusting Canadian to get in the car of a complete\nstranger in New York.\n\f\n* The ability of people to get my cell number still baﬄes me.\n\f\n* Rules create rituals that have inertia—and in this way this rule\nuses the very aspect of human nature that gets us in trouble for\ngood.\n\f\n* This was inspired by this Bill Walsh quote: “Champions behave\nlike champions before they’re champions. They have a winning\nstandard of performance before they are winners.”\n\f\n* Even books are ﬁltered by editors these days. I suppose you could\nmake an argument that in the old days, someone could publish a\nbook directly without a ﬁlter, but I think the point is pretty clear.\n\f\n* Jim Rohn said, “One deﬁnition of failure is making a few errors in\njudgment repeated every day.” And a summary of James Clear’s\nexcellent book Atomic Habits is that good habits make time your\nfriend and bad ones make it your enemy.\n\f\n* An idea from The Path of Least Resistance by Robert Fritz. Robert\ntalks about how structure determines behavior.\n\f\n* Like my friend Annie Duke, who gave me this example.\n\f\n* Another eﬀective rule I’ve seen is that if you wouldn’t move\nsomething out of your schedule in the next two days for it, just say\nno.\n\f\n*†I know I did not come up with this thought experiment but I’m\nunsure whom to give credit to.\n\f\n* I’d love to hear your automatic rules. Email shane@fs.blog with\nthe subject “Automatic Rule” and let me know.\n\f\n* Two eﬀective questions I ask my kids to slow them down and have\nthem think: (1) Do you want to put water or gasoline on this\nsituation? And (2), Is this behavior going to get you what you\nwant?\n\f\n* I learned this ﬁrsthand at operational meetings. Only the person in\ncharge of the operation could deﬁne the objective, the goals, and\nthe problems. Everyone else could suggest things but one person\nhad to own the decision, and that person was in charge of the\noperation. It’s been reinforced many times by Adam Robinson, Peter\nKaufman, and Randall Stutman.\n\f\n* I had witnessed this for years before Randall Stutman pointed out\nto me what was happening.\n\f\n* At Farnam Street we use this example in our course Decision by\nDesign, where we teach world-class people to make better\ndecisions. (If you want to be added to the waitlist, just email me at\nshane@fs.blog with the subject line “DBD Waitlist.”)\n\f\n* Several people have attributed this quote to Wittgenstein, but a\nsearch through the InteLex database of both his published and his\nunpublished writings reveals it nowhere. Perhaps the closest\nquotation is from section 199 of his Philosophical Investigations: “To\nunderstand a sentence means to understand a language. To\nunderstand a language means to be master of a technique.”\n\f\n* This is an idea that came from a conversation with my friend\nChris Sparling."

For more, see “Three Filters Needed to\nThink Through Problems,” Farnam Street (blog), December 14,\n2015, https://fs.blog/garrett-hardin-three-ﬁlters/.\n\f\n* This example comes from the course Decision by Design.\n\f\n* I got this from combining the ideas of Warren Buﬀett, Charlie\nMunger, and Peter Kaufman.\n\f\n* This is also Nassim Taleb’s idea of domain dependence: when we\nknow the answer but lack the understanding to troubleshoot when\nthings aren’t working, or to apply our knowledge to problems that\nseem the same but aren’t exactly the same.\n\f\n* Please note, this never works. If you can’t oﬀer value and get your\npoint across in a few sentences, you won’t even get read.\n\f\n* This is a play on a quote by Naval Ravikant. “Speciﬁc knowledge\ncannot be taught, but it can be learned” (@naval), Twitter, January\n17, 2019, 10:48 p.m., https://twitter.com/naval/\nstatus/1086108038539309061."
