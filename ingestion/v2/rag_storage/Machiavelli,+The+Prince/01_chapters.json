These are the \nwords that recur insistently throughout The Prince. And \nthen again: success, victory, prestige, achievement, and, on the \nother hand: loss, failure, defeat, death. These opposites are \nlinked together by an almost obsessive use of  because, so \nthat, hence, therefore, as a result, as a consequence. From start \nto finish we have a vision of  man manoeuvring precariously \nin a suffocating net of  cause and effect. What is at stake is \nsurvival. Anything extra is luxury .\nThe Prince was written by a  forty- four- year- old diplomat \nfacing ruin. After fourteen years of  influence and prestige, \na change of  regime had led to his dismissal. Suspected of  \nconspiring against the new government, he was imprisoned \nand tortured. The rapid reversal of  fortunes could not have \nbeen more devastating. Found innocent and released, he \nleft town to live with his wife and family on a small farm. \nFor a worldly man and compulsive womanizer, used to \nbeing at the frenetic heart of  public life, this too felt like \npunishment. Idle and bitter, he tramped the hills by day \nand, in the long, empty evenings, began to write down \nsome considerations on how to win power and, above \nall,  how to hold on to it, how not to be a victim of \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   9 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nx\nIntroduction\ncircumstance. The result was a slim volume that would be \na scandal for centuries.\nNiccolò Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, the \nsame year Lorenzo de’ Medici (il Magnifico) came to \npower. First male child after two daughters, Niccolò would \ngrow up very close to his father, Bernardo, an  ex- lawyer, \nmostly unemployed, with good contacts but no significant \nwealth or influence. If  the son was to rise in the world, \nand he was determined to do so, he would have to count \non his own wits and charm. Niccolò’s younger brother, \nTotto, chose not to compete and went into the priesthood. \nThe boys’ mother, it should be said, was an extremely \ndevout woman, a writer of  religious poems and hymns. \nTheir father on the other hand was sceptical, more at home \nwith the sober works of  Latin antiquity than the Bible. \nNiccolò may have taken his writing skills from his mother, \nbut over divisions on religion he stood with his father and \nthe Roman historians.\nOne says of  Lorenzo il Magnifico that he ‘came to \npower’, but officially Florence was a republic and since \nLorenzo was only twenty years old in 1469 he was far too \nyoung to hold elected office; an explanation is required. \nWhen, in the thirteenth century , the Florentines had \nthrown out the noble families who used to run the town, \nthey introduced a republican constitution of  exemplary \nidealism. A government of  eight priori led by one gonfalo-\nniere, or prime minister, would be elected every two \nmonths by drawing tags from a series of  bags containing \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   10 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxi\nIntroduction\nthe names of   well- to- do men from different guilds and \ndifferent areas of  town. This lottery would allow each \nmajor profession and each geographical area to be ade -\nquately and constantly represented. Every individual (of  a \ncertain social standing) could expect a brief  share of  power \nin order that no one could ever seize it permanently .\nThe system was unworkable. Every two months a new \ngovernment might take a different position on key issues. \nThe potential for instability more or less obliged whichever \nfamily was in the ascendant to step in and impose continu-\nity . From 1434 on, the Medicis –   first Cosimo, then Piero, \nthen Lorenzo –  had been manipulating the electoral pro-\ncess to make sure that most of  the names in the bags were \nfriendly to themselves and that all of  those actually selected \nfor government would toe the Medici line. Hence, although \nthe Florentines still liked to boast that they were free citi-\nzens who bowed the knee to no man, by the  mid- fifteenth \ncentury they were in fact living in something very close to \na dictatorship. When the rival Pazzi family tried to assas-\nsinate Lorenzo in the Duomo in April 1478, it was because \nthey saw no legitimate way of  putting him in his place as \nan ordinary citizen. Machiavelli thus grew up in a society \nwhere the distance between how things were actually run \nand how they were described as being run could not have \nbeen greater. He was close to his ninth birthday when the \ncaptured Pazzi conspirators, one an archbishop, were hung \nupside down from the high windows of  the city’s main \ngovernment building and left there for weeks to rot. He \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   11 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxii\nIntroduction\nwould have understood very young the price of  getting it \nwrong in politics.\nThe young Machiavelli might also have had reason to \ndoubt that there was any meaningful difference between \nmatters of  religion and matters of  state. The pope had \nbacked the Pazzi conspiracy , priests had been involved in \nthe assassination attempt and Lorenzo was excommuni -\ncated after it failed; the religious edict was a political tool. \nA war between Florence and Rome ensued and the hostility \nonly ended in 1480 when Turkish raids on the southern \nItalian coast prompted a rare moment of  unity in the pen-\ninsula. Years later, Lorenzo would so ingratiate himself  \nwith a new pope as to get his son Giovanni made a cardinal \nat age thirteen. From excommunication to pope’s favourite \nwas quite a change of  fortune and once again it was more \na matter of  politics than of  faith. Nothing, it appeared, was \nbeyond the reach of  wealth and astute negotiation.\nAt this point Machiavelli was  twenty- one. We know very \nlittle of  his early adult life, but one thing he definitely did \nat least once was to listen to the fiery preacher Girolamo \nSavonarola, head of  the influential monastery of  San \nMarco. Savonarola’s was a different kind of  Christianity: \nrather than the corrupt,  pleasure- conscious world of  the \npapacy , whose decadence had offered no resistance to the \nrise of  Humanism, this austere monk represented an early \nmanifestation of  what we have come to call fundamental-\nism, a return to the biblical text as the sole authority \non earth and a vision of  the Church as embattled and \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   12 21/05/15   3:00 PM"

    "raw_text": "xiii\nIntroduction\ndefensive in a world increasingly interested in values that \nhad little to do with the gospel story . With great conviction, \nSavonarola preached the virtues of  poverty , advocated the \nburning of  any book or work of  art that was impure and \nprophesied doom for the sinful Florentines in the form of  \na foreign invasion. In 1494 his prophesy came true.\nTo get any grasp of  Machiavelli’s diplomatic career and the \nrange of  reference he draws on in The Prince , one must \nhave some sense of  the complicated political geography \nof  Italy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and \nof  the profound change that occurred in the 1490s, a change \nthat would determine Italy’s fate for the next 350 years.\nFor most of  the fifteenth century there had been five \nmajor players in the peninsula: the Kingdom of  Naples, \nthe Papal States, Florence, V enice and Milan. Extending \nfrom just south of  Rome to the southernmost tip of \nCalabria, the Kingdom of  Naples was by far the largest. \nWedged in the centre, with only precarious access to the \nsea, Florence was the smallest and weakest.\nAll five powers were in fierce competition for whatever \nterritory they could take. Having lost much of  their over-\nseas empire to the Turks, the V enetians were eager to \nexpand inside the northern Italian plain (Ferrara, V erona, \nBrescia) and down the Adriatic coast (Forlì Rimini). Con-\nscious of  the size and power of  a now unified France to \nthe north, Milan hoped for gains to the south and west \n(Genoa) as a  counter- weight. Florence simply tried to get \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   13 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxiv\nIntroduction\nbigger in any way that was convenient. Over the previous \ncentury the Florentines had captured Arezzo, Pisa and \nCortona and wasted huge energies in a series of  failed \nattempts to conquer Lucca.\nRome’s aim under any pope was always to expand north \nand east into Romagna and Emilia, with a view to swal -\nlowing up Perugia, Bologna, Rimini and Forlì, a project \nthat would bring it into conflict with both V enice and Flor-\nence. In the far south, Naples was governed by a branch \nof  the house of  Aragon, but the crown was contested by \nthe Angevin kings of  France and by the Spanish royal fam-\nily (also Aragons) which already ruled Sicily .\nSo the scenario was complicated. Scattered between the \nlarge states were at least a score of  smaller ones, some no \nbigger than a town and the surrounding fields, and all con-\nstantly under threat of  invasion from one enemy or \nanother. However, if  the situation was rarely static, it is \nalso true that there were few major changes. As soon as \none power achieved some significant military victory , the \nothers immediately formed an alliance against it to halt its \nprogress. Florence, in particular, owed its continuing inde-\npendence largely to the fact that if  V enice, Milan or Rome \ntried to take it, the other two would at once intervene to \nprevent this happening. So for more than a hundred years \na certain balance of  power had been kept. All this ended \nwith the French invasion of  1494.\nThe invasion was, as Machiavelli himself  explains in The \nPrince, largely the Italians’ own fault. For some time the \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   14 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxv\nIntroduction\nfive states had been in the habit of  frightening each other \nwith the threat of  foreign intervention. During the war \nagainst Rome and Naples in 1480, Florence had invited the \nFrench king to pursue his claim to the throne of  Naples \nmore actively . In 1482, during a V enetian assault on Ferrara, \nFlorence and Milan had encouraged the Turks to step up \ntheir attacks on V enice’s maritime possessions. V enice had \nreplied by inviting the Duke of  Orleans to pursue his claim \nto Milan. In a war against Naples in 1483, Pope Innocent \nVIII had reminded the Duke of  Lorraine that he too had \na claim to the southern kingdom and invited him to send \ntroops.\nThere was an element of  bluff  and brinkmanship in \nthese threats, but in 1494 when King Charles VIII of  France \naccepted Milan’s invitation to make good his claim to the \ncrown of  Naples, the bluff  was called. Charles marched \nsouth with an army far larger than any Italians had seen in \nliving memory . From that moment on, the peninsula would \nnot be free from foreign intervention until the completion \nof  the Risorgimento in 1870. Struggling to hold Naples, \nthe French would invite in the Spanish from Sicily to split \nthe kingdom with them, and the Spanish, after Charles I \nof  Spain inherited the crown of  the Holy Roman Empire, \nwould eventually push France back north of  the Alps, put \nRome to the sack and dominate Italy for 150 years.\nBut that is to leap ahead. In 1494, when the French first \nmarched through Lombardy heading for Naples, Florence \nwas directly in their path and, what’s more, an ally of \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   15 21/05/15   3:00 PM"

    "raw_text": "xvi\nIntroduction\nNaples. At this point Lorenzo il Magnifico had been dead \nfor two years and the Medici regime was led by his incom-\npetent son, Piero. So abject was Piero’s capitulation to \nCharles, so spineless his decision simply to surrender the \ncity’s dependent territories, that the Florentines rebelled \nagainst him. The Medici regime collapsed and very soon \nthe preacher who had been prophesying this disaster was \nmade gonfaloniere, first minister, this time on a yearly , rather \nthan a  two- monthly , basis.\nGirolamo Savonarola ruled Florence from 1494 to 1498, \nduring which time the city passed from being one of  the \ncentres of  Renaissance Humanism to a  book- burning, fun-\ndamentalist theocracy . Realizing that Savonarola’s claim \nto be God’s prophet was a far greater threat to its authority \nthan any Humanism, scepticism or eclecticism, the Church \nin Rome did everything possible to bring about his downfall \nand in 1498, having lost much of  his support in Florence, \nthe preacher was convicted of  heresy and burned at the \nstake. It was shortly after these dramatic events that Nic-\ncolò Machiavelli succeeded in getting himself  elected to \nthe important positions of  Secretary of  the Second Chan-\ncery (one of  two key state departments in Florence) and, \nsoon afterwards, Secretary of  the Ten of  War, a committee \nthat dealt with foreign relations and war preparations.\nMachiavelli was  twenty- eight. We have no idea how he \narrived at such appointments at this early age. There is no \nrecord of  any special experience that would warrant such \nconfidence in his abilities. But within months he was \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   16 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxvii\nIntroduction\ntravelling to neighbouring states to represent Florence’s \ninterests, and over the next fourteen years he would be \ninvolved in important, often  long- drawn- out missions to \nthe King of  France, the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, \nCesare Borgia, Caterina Sforza and many others. In \nbetween these missions he was frequently and very actively \nengaged in Florence’s ongoing military campaign to  re- take \nPisa, which had regained its independence during the \nFrench invasion. Pisa was crucial to Florentine commerce \nin that it gave the town an outlet to the sea.\nIntroductions to The Prince generally play down Machi-\navelli’s abilities as a diplomat, presenting these years as \nuseful only in so far as they offered him the material he \nwould draw on for his writing after he had lost his position. \nMachiavelli would not have seen things that way . For more \nthan a decade he was Florence’s top diplomat and proud \nto be so, and if  the missions he undertook did not produce \nspectacular results this was largely because he was repre-\nsenting the weakest of  the main states in Italy in a period \nof  particular confusion and vulnerability that would even-\ntually see four foreign powers militarily involved in the \npeninsula: France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and \nSwitzerland.\nSavonarola had taken Florence towards an alliance with \nFrance; the priest’s successors followed the same policy , \nbut without any clear vision of  how the city might achieve \nstability and security in the long term. To make matters \nworse, having decided in 1502 that their gonfaloniere, or first \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   17 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxviii\nIntroduction\nminister, should be elected for life, the Florentines gave the \njob to Piero Soderini, an honourable man but chronically \nincapable of  making any kind of  bold decision. Machia -\nvelli’s diplomatic career was thus mostly taken up in \nattempts to persuade surrounding and threatening states \nto leave Florence alone and not to expect financial or mili-\ntary help from her for their wars elsewhere; that is, as far \nas there was a discernible,  long- term policy it was one of  \nprevarication. Far from home, Machiavelli would fre -\nquently receive contradictory orders after he had already \nstarted negotiating. Arriving in foreign towns, he would \nfind that his expense allowance wasn’t sufficient to pay \ncouriers to take his messages back to Florence. Sometimes \nhe could barely afford to feed and clothe himself. Such was \nthe contempt of  the more powerful monarchs that he was \noften obliged to wait days or even weeks before being \ngranted an audience.\nIt is in the light of  these frustrations that we have to \nunderstand Machiavelli’s growing obsession, very much in \nevidence in The Prince, with the formation of  a citizen army . \nFlorence was weak partly because of  its size but mostly \nbecause it had no military forces of  its own. It relied on \nmercenary armies which were notorious for evaporating \nwhen things got tough, before the gates of  Pisa for example. \nA  power- base built on an efficient and patriotic civilian \narmy would give a diplomat like Machiavelli a little more \nclout and respect when he negotiated. Or so he hoped.\nIn June of  1502, four years into the job, Machiavelli met \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   18 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxix\nIntroduction\nCesare Borgia, son of  Pope Alexander VI. With his father’s \nsupport, Borgia was carving out a new state for himself  \non the northern borders of  the Papal States and had just \ncaptured the city of  Urbino to the east of  Florence. Sent \non a mission to dissuade Borgia from advancing into Flor-\nentine territory , Machiavelli was deeply impressed by the \nman. Seductive, determined, cunning and ruthless, Borgia \nwas a leader in the epic mode. Certainly he could hardly \nhave been more different from the diplomat’s dithering \nboss, Soderini.\nMachiavelli was on another mission to Borgia in January \n1503 when the adventurer invited a group of  rebels to nego -\ntiations in the coastal town of  Senigallia, then had them \nseized and murdered as soon as they were inside the town \nwalls. Here was a man, Machiavelli realized, determined \nto take circumstance by the scruff  of  the neck. It was not \nso much Borgia’s willingness to ignore Christian principles \nthat fascinated him, as his ability to assess a situation rap-\nidly , make his calculations, then act decisively in whatever \nway would bring the desired result. This modern, positivist \nattitude, where thought and analysis serve in so far as they \nproduce decisive action, rather than abstract concepts, lies \nat the heart of  The Prince.\nMeanwhile Florence continued to drift. Machiavelli was \nonce again on the scene in 1503, this time in Rome, when \nBorgia’s empire collapsed after both he and his father fell \nseriously ill; legend has it that Alexander had accidentally \npoisoned them both. The pope died and the son lost his \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   19 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxx\nIntroduction\n power- base. Three years later Machiavelli was travelling \nwith the later Pope Julius at the head of  the papal army \nwhen Julius demanded admission to the town of  Perugia, \nwalked in with only a small bodyguard and told the local \ntyrant, Giampaolo Baglioni, to get out or face certain \ndefeat. Sure that Baglioni would simply kill Julius, Machi-\navelli was amazed when the man caved in and fled. Such \nwere the pope’s coercive powers as he then marched north \nto lay siege to Bologna that Florence was once again forced \nto enter an alliance and a war in which it had no desire to \nbe involved.\nAs Secretary of  the Ten of  War, Machiavelli enjoyed just \none moment of  personal glory , in 1509, when the citizen \narmy that he had finally been allowed to form overcame \nPisan resistance and took the town after a long siege. Given \nthe many failed attempts to capture Pisa using mercenary \narmies, this victory was a powerful vindication of  Machi-\navelli’s conviction that citizen armies were superior. It was \nalso the only occasion in his fourteen years of  service when \nSoderini took the initiative with success.\nBut in every other respect things went from bad to \nworse. Florence was living on borrowed time, its freedom \ndependent on the whims of  others. Three years after the \ncapture of  Pisa, when Pope Julius, now in alliance with the \nSpanish, defeated the French at Ravenna, he immediately \nsent an army to Florence to impose a return of  the Medici \nand transform the city into a puppet state dependent on \nRome. After brief  resistance, the Florentine army was \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   20 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxi\nIntroduction\ncrushed at Prato a few miles to the north of  the city . \n Soderini escaped and the Medici returned. Machiavelli \nwas unemployed and unemployable.\nThe scandalous nature of  The Prince was largely deter -\nmined by its structure rather than any conscious desire to \nshock. Originally entitled On Principalities, the book opens \nwith an attempt to categorize different kinds of  states and \ngovernments at different moments of  their development, \nthen, moving back and forth between ancient and modern \nhistory , to establish some universal principles relative to \nthe business of  taking and holding power in each kind of  \nstate. Given Machiavelli’s experience, wide reading and \ndetermined intellectual honesty , the project obliged him \nto explain that there were many occasions when winning \nand holding political power was possible only if  a leader \nwas ready to act outside the moral codes that applied to \nordinary individuals. Public opinion was such, he explained, \nthat, once victory was achieved, nobody was going to put \nthe winner on trial. Political leaders were above the law .\nHad Machiavelli insisted on deploring this unhappy state \nof  affairs, had he dwelt on other criteria for judging a \nleader, aside from his mere ability to stay in power and \nbuild a strong state, had he told us with appropriate piety \nthat power was hardly worth having if  you had to sell your \nsoul to get it, he could have headed off  a great deal of \ncriticism while still delivering the same information. But \naside from one or two token regrets that the world is not \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   21 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxii\nIntroduction\na nicer place, Machiavelli does not do this. It wasn’t his \nproject. Rather he takes it for granted that we already know \nthat life, particularly political life, is routinely , and some-\ntimes unspeakably , cruel, and that once established in a \nposition of  power a ruler may have no choice but to kill \nor be killed.\nThis is where the words ‘of  necessity’, ‘must’ and ‘have \nto’ become so ominous. For The Prince is most convincing \nand most scandalous not in its famous general statements –  \nthat the end justifies the means, that men must be pampered \nor crushed, that the only sure way of  keeping a conquered \nterritory is to devastate it utterly , and so on –  but in the \nmany historical examples of  barbarous behaviour that \nMachiavelli puts before us, without any  hand- wringing, as \nthings that were bound to happen: the V enetians find that \ntheir mercenary leader Carmagnola is not putting much \neffort into his fighting any more, but they are afraid that \nif  they dismiss him he will walk off  with the territory he \npreviously captured for them: ‘at which point the only safe \nthing to do was to kill him.’ Hiero of  Syracuse, when given \ncommand of  his country’s army , finds that they are all \nmercenaries and ‘realizing that they could neither make \nuse of  them, nor let them go, he had them all cut to pieces.’\nThe climax of  this approach comes with Machiavelli’s \npresentation of  the ruthless Cesare Borgia as a model for \nany man determined to win a state for himself  (as if  such \na project were not essentially dissimilar from building a \nhouse or starting a business). Having tamed and unified \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   22 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxiii\nIntroduction\nthe Romagna with the help of  his cruel minister Remirro \nde Orco, Machiavelli tells us, Borgia decided to deflect \npeople’s hatred away from himself  by putting the blame \nfor all atrocities on his minister and then doing away with \nhim: so ‘he had de Orco beheaded and his corpse put on \ndisplay one morning in the piazza in Cesena with a wooden \nblock and a bloody knife beside. The ferocity of  the spec-\ntacle left people both gratified and shocked.’\nIt’s hard not to feel, as we read the chapters on Borgia, \nthat this is the point where Machiavelli’s book ceases to be \nthe learned, but fairly tame, On Principalities and is trans-\nformed into the extraordinary and disturbing work that \nwould eventually be called The Prince. In short, Machiavel-\nli’s attention has shifted from a methodical analysis of \ndifferent political systems to a gripping and personally \nengaged account of  the psychology of  the leader who has \nplaced himself  beyond the constrictions of  Christian ethics \nand lives in a delirium of  pure power. For a diplomat like \nMachiavelli, who had spent his life among the powerful \nbut never really held the knife by the handle, a state \nemployee so scrupulously honest that when investigated \nfor embezzlement he ended up being reimbursed monies \nthat were due to him, it was all too easy to fall into a state \nof  envy and almost longing when contemplating the awe-\nsome Borgia who had no qualms about taking anything \nthat came his way and never dreamed of  being honest to \nanyone.\nAt a deep level, then, the scandal of  The Prince is \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   23 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxiv\nIntroduction\nintimately tied up with the scandal of  all writers of  fiction \nand history who in the quiet of  their studies take vicarious \nenjoyment in the ruthlessness of  the characters they \ndescribe –  but with this difference: Machiavelli systematizes \nsuch behaviour and appears to recommend it, if  only to \nthose few who are committed to winning and holding \n political power. The author’s description, in a letter to a \nfriend, of  his state of  mind when writing the book makes \nit clear what a relief  it was, during these months immedi-\nately following his dismissal, imprisonment and torture, \nto imagine himself  back in the world of  politics and, if  \nonly on paper, on a par with history’s great heroes.\nCome evening, I walk home and go into my study . In the \npassage I take off  my ordinary clothes, caked with mud \nand slime, and put on my formal palace gowns. Then when \nI’m properly dressed I take my place in the courts of  the \npast where the ancients welcome me kindly and I eat my \nfill of  the only food that is really mine and that I was born \nfor. I’m quite at ease talking to them and asking them why \nthey did the things they did, and they are generous with \ntheir answers. So for four hours at a time I feel no pain, I \nforget all my worries, I’m not afraid of  poverty and death \ndoesn’t frighten me. I put myself  entirely in their minds.\nIn so far as The Prince remains a persuasive account of  how \npolitical power is won and lost it is so because it eventually \nfocuses on the mind, or, to be more precise, on the \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   24 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxv\nIntroduction\ninteraction of  individual and collective psychologies, the \nlatter fairly predictable, the former infinitely varied, the \ntwo together dangerously volatile. The book is not a care-\nful elaboration of  a rigid, predetermined vision. More and \nmore, as Machiavelli rapidly assesses different kinds of \nstates and forms of  government, different contexts, differ-\nent men and their successes and failures, he runs up against \ntwo factors that defy codification: the role of  luck and the \nmystery of  personality . By the end of  the book he is beyond \nthe stage of  offering heroes and success stories as models, \naware that if  there is one circumstance that a man cannot \neasily change it is his own character: even had he wanted \nto, Soderini could not have modelled himself  on Borgia, \nnor vice versa.\nIn particular Machiavelli is fascinated by the way certain \npersonality traits can mesh positively or negatively with \ncertain sets of  historical circumstances. A man can be suc-\ncessful in one situation then fail miserably in another; a \npolicy that works well in one moment is a disaster the next. \nRather than one ideal ruler, then, different men are required \nfor different situations. The only key to permanent political \nsuccess would be always to adapt one’s deepest instincts \nto new events, but, as Machiavelli ruefully observes, that \nwould effectively mean the end of  ‘luck’ and the end of  \nhistory .\nMachiavelli’s own mind was deeply divided during the \nwriting of  The Prince and it is the resulting tension that \naccounts for much of  the book’s fascination and ambiguity . \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   25 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxvi\nIntroduction\nOn the one hand, as a form of  private therapy , he was \ndisinterestedly pursuing the truth about power and politics: \nto establish how states really were won and lost would give \nhim an illusion of  control and bolster his  self- esteem. At \nthe same time, and perhaps less consciously , he was vicari-\nously enjoying, in the stories of  Borgia and others, the sort \nof  dramatic political achievements that had always been \ndenied to him. In this regard it’s interesting to see how \nrapidly he glosses over Borgia’s abject fall from power, his \narrest, imprisonment and death, almost as if  the author \nwere in denial about his hero’s ultimate fallibility .\nTherapeutic as this might have been, however, at another \nlevel The Prince was clearly written for publication and \nmeant as a public performance. Machiavelli loves to show \noff  his intelligence, his range of  reference, his clever rea-\nsoning. Even here, though, his intentions were divided and \nperhaps contradictory . At his most passionate and focused \nhe was involved in a debate with all the great historians \nand philosophers of  the past and determined to show his \ncontemporaries that his own mind was as sharp as the best. \nBut in a more practical mood Machiavelli was planning to \nuse the book as a passport to get himself  back into a job: \nso evident and compelling, he hoped, would his analytical \nskills appear, that the ruler to whom he formally gave and \ndedicated the book would necessarily want to employ him; \nhence the flattering tone of  the opening dedication and \nthe addition of  The Prince’s final patriotic pages proposing \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   26 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxvii\nIntroduction\nthat the ruler in question should be the man to rid Italy of  \nforeign oppression.\nWho was this ruler? Shortly before Machiavelli had been \nreleased from prison, Pope Julius had died and been \nreplaced by Giovanni de’ Medici, il Magnifico’s son, the \nman who had become a cardinal at thirteen. This was \nMarch 1513. When he started work on The Prince some \nmonths later, Machiavelli had intended to dedicate the \nbook to Giovanni’s brother, Giuliano, who had been put \nin charge of  Florence after the Medicis’ return. However, \nwhen the effeminate Giuliano began to move away from \npolitics and was replaced in Florence by his aggressive, \nwarlike nephew Lorenzo, Machiavelli decided to switch \nthe dedication to the younger man.\nThus far the writer showed himself  flexible in the face \nof  changing events. Yet there is something ingenuous and \nalmost endearing in the clever diplomat’s miscalculation \nhere. The brilliant reasoning required to convince yourself  \nthat you had got a grip on politics and history , the profound \nanalysis that would demonstrate to your fellow intellectu-\nals that you were as  clear- headed as Livy , Tacitus and \nThucydides put together, were not the qualities that a \nyoung and hardly  well- read Medici prince was likely to \ncomprehend, never mind enjoy .\nGiven the book in 1515, Lorenzo probably never opened \nit and certainly didn’t take time to study Machiavelli’s care-\nfully crafted reflections. Then, even if  he had read it, would \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   27 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxviii\nIntroduction\nLorenzo, or indeed any other ruler, have wanted to employ \na diplomat who had gone on record as saying that trickery \nwas largely the name of  the game and that though it wasn’t \nimportant to have a religious faith it was absolutely essen-\ntial to appear to have one? Machiavelli should have been \nthe first to understand that as an instrument for furthering \nhis diplomatic career, rather than a literary and philosoph-\nical achievement in its own right, the book’s honesty would \nbe  self- defeating: the two goals were never compatible.\nSurprised and disappointed by The Prince’s failure, Mach-\niavelli went back to womanizing. Aside from routine \nwhoring, he fell in and out of  love easily , pursuing passion \nwithout discretion or restraint. And just as he had more \nluck with romance than diplomacy , he had more success \nwhen he wrote ironic,  sex- centred comedies rather than \ncandid but dangerous political analyses. In 1518 the first \nperformance of  his play The Mandragola, in which a young \nman invents the most absurd subterfuges to get a married \nwoman into bed, won Machiavelli immediate celebrity; \nsome years later Clizia, which this time has an older man \n hell- bent on having his way with a very young woman, \nconfirmed his talent.\nBut literary success was not enough for Machiavelli. It \nwas active politics that interested him, and, though he \nlaboured for ten years or so on his Discourses on Livy, then \non a long history of  Florence and finally on a short work \nentitled The Art of  War, it was his old job as the city’s prin-\ncipal ambassador that he always yearned for. Finally , in \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   28 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxix\nIntroduction\n1525, Pope Clement VII, alias Giulio de’ Medici (Giovanni’s \ncousin), drew the  ex- diplomat back into politics, asking \nhim for advice on how to deal with the growing antagon-\nism between the French and the Spanish. As an eventual \nclash between the two great powers inside Italy loomed \never closer, Machiavelli was given the task of  overseeing \nFlorence’s defensive walls. When the crunch came, how-\never, and the armies of  Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, \nnow united under the same crown, marched south into \nItaly , they simply bypassed Florence, went straight to Rome \nand sacked it. It was an occasion of  the most disgraceful \nsavagery on a scale Italy had not witnessed for centuries. \nIn the aftermath, the Medici regime in Florence collapsed \nand once again Machiavelli was out of  favour. Over -\nwhelmed with disappointment and in the habit of  taking \nmedicines that weren’t good for him, he died in June 1527, \naged  fifty- eight, having accepted, no doubt after careful \ncalculation, extreme unction.\nThat there are many different roads to notoriety and that \na man’s achievements may combine with historical events \nin unexpected ways, are truths Machiavelli was well aware \nof. So he would have appreciated the irony that it was \nlargely due to Luther’s Protestant reform and the ensuing \nwars of  religion that his name became the object of  the \nmost implacable vilification and, as a consequence, univer-\nsally famous.\nThe turning point came in 1572. The Prince had not been \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   29 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxx\nIntroduction\npublished in Machiavelli’s lifetime. After circulating for \nyears in manuscript form, then in a printed Latin edition \n(still entitled On Principalities), it finally appeared in Italian \nin 1532, only to be put on Pope Paul IV’s Index of  Prohibited \nBooks in 1559, this partly in response to the prompting of  \nthe English cardinal Reginald Pole, who maintained that, \nwritten as it was by ‘Satan’s finger’, The Prince was largely \nresponsible for Henry VIII’s decision to take the English \nChurch away from Rome.\nMeantime, in France, the conflict between the Protest-\nant Huguenots and the Catholics was intensifying and \nwould reach a head under the reign of  the sickly young \nCharles IX, who for the most part was controlled by his \nmother, the Italian, indeed Florentine, Catherine de’ Med-\nici, daughter of  the same Lorenzo de’ Medici to whom \nMachiavelli had dedicated The Prince. Catherine had \nbrought a great many Italian favourites into the French \ncourt, a move guaranteed to arouse  anti- Italian feeling. In \ngeneral, she sought to dampen down the religious conflict \nwhich threatened to tear France apart, but nevertheless \nshe would be held responsible for the St Bartholomew’s \nDay Massacre of  1572 when thousands of  Huguenots were \nmurdered. One potential victim, Innocent Gentillet, \nescaped to Protestant Geneva and wrote a Discours contre \nMachiavel that was to set the tone for  anti- Machiavellian \ncriticism for decades to come.\nIntended as an attack on Catherine de’ Medici and mili-\ntant French Catholicism, and hence a defence of  the \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   30 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxi\nIntroduction\nHuguenots, the book described Catherine as a compulsive \nreader of  Machiavelli and, playing on  anti- Italian feeling, \nclaimed that both queen and writer were representative of  \na callous and villainous trait in Italian national character. \nListed out of  context, the ideas developed in The Prince  \nwere schematized and simplified, allowing readers to \nimagine they had read Machiavelli himself  when what they \nwere actually getting was a travesty that legitimized any \nform of  brutality and rejoiced in amoral calculation.\nFrom this point on, Machiavelli’s name escaped from \nthe restricted circle of  intellectual reflection and became \na popular term of  denigration. ‘Mach Evil’ and ‘Match- a- \nvillain’ were typical English corruptions, ‘Mitchell Wylie’ \na Scottish. Many critics would not bother reading his work \nin the original but take their information from Gentillet, \nwhose ‘ Anti- Machiavel’, as his book became known, was \nquickly translated into Latin for English readers and then, \nsome twenty years later, directly into English. At this point \n(the end of  the sixteenth century) the first English trans-\nlation of  Machiavelli’s work was yet to appear.\nIronically , in the years after the St Bartholomew’s Day \nMassacre, as Catherine de’ Medici struggled to find some \nsolution to France’s civil wars, and in particular to convince \nCatholics of  the need to tolerate the existence of  the \nHuguenots, if  only in Huguenot enclaves, both she and \nher supposed mentor Machiavelli once again came under \nattack, this time from the Catholic side. The accusation \nnow was that, in the attempt to avoid conflict, religious \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   31 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxii\nIntroduction\ntruths of  supreme importance were being subordinated \nto questions of  political convenience, something that \nwould eventually transform France, the Catholics feared, \ninto a secular state.\nHere the criticism comes closer to the real spirit of \nMachiavelli. Renaissance Humanism in general had shifted \nthe focus of  intellectual reflection from questions of  the-\nology and metaphysical truth to matters of  immediate and \npractical human interest. In general, however, lip service \nhad always been paid to the ultimate superiority of  reli -\ngious matters and writers had avoided suggesting that there \nmight be a profound incompatibility between rival value \nsystems: it was perfectly possible, that is, to be a good Chris-\ntian and an effective political leader.\nMachiavelli, on the contrary , made it clear that, as he \nsaw it, Christian principles and effective political leadership \nwere not always compatible; situations would arise where \none was bound to choose between the two. It was not, \nas his critics claimed, that he rejected all ethical values \noutright; the strength, unity and independence of  a people \nand state certainly constituted goals worth fighting \nfor (‘I love my country more than my soul’, Machiavelli \ndeclared in a letter to fellow historian Francesco Guicciar-\ndini). But such goals could not always be achieved without \nabandoning Christian principles; two  value- systems were \nat loggerheads. To make matters worse, Machiavelli did \nnot appear to be concerned about this. He took it as an \nevident truth: Christian principles were admirable, but not \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   32 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxiii\nIntroduction\napplicable for politicians in certain circumstances; the idea \nthat all human behaviour could be assessed in relation to \none set of  values was naive and utopian. It was in so far as \nMachiavelli allowed these dangerous implications to sur-\nface in his writing that he both unmasked, and himself  \nbecame identified with, what we might call the unaccept-\nable face of  Renaissance Humanism.\nHow much the presentation of  the Machiavellian villain \nin Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, from Kyd and Marlowe, \nthrough to Middleton, Shakespeare and ultimately Ben \nJonson, owed to Gentillet’s ‘ Anti- Machiavel’ and how much \nto a direct knowledge of  Machiavelli’s writings is still a \nmatter of  academic dispute. In the 1580s an Italian version \nof  The Prince was printed in England, avoiding a publication \nban by claiming falsely on the frontispiece that it was \nprinted in Italy . Many educated English people at the time \nhad a good knowledge of  Italian. Sir Francis Bacon had \ncertainly read The Prince before its first legal publication in \nEnglish in 1640, defending the Florentine in the Advancement \nof  Learning (1605) with the remark: ‘We are much beholden \nto Machiavel and others, that write what men do and not \nwhat they ought to do.’\nBut the ‘murderous Machiavel’ who gets more than \n400 mentions in Elizabethan drama, thus making the Flor -\nentine’s name synonymous with the idea of  villainy for \ncenturies to come, is another matter. The Roman author \nSeneca had long ago established a tradition in tragic drama \nthat featured an evil, calculating tyrant who would stop at \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   33 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxiv\nIntroduction\nnothing to grasp all the power he could. Renaissance Italian \ntheatre had updated this type of  villain with elements from \nMachiavelli, transforming the character into an unscrupu-\nlous courtier who takes pleasure in wicked calculation and \ncruelty . It was from this model that the English theatre \ndeveloped its endless  mani festations of  the devious rogue \n(pander, miser, or revengeful cuckold) who administers \npoisons with aplomb and is never without a dagger \nbeneath his cloak.\nFrom the point of  view of  the dramatist, an unscrupu-\nlous character who has a secret agenda and relies on his \npresumed intellectual superiority to dupe those around \nhim is obviously an exciting proposition. Such a figure can \nbe depended upon to create tension, keep the plot moving \nand allow for resolutions where the larger group’s benign \norder once again imposes itself  after the tragic disturbance \ncaused by the wicked, scheming individual. Beyond a super-\nficial repulsion that the audience feels towards such a \ncharacter, be it Marlowe’s Jew of  Malta, Webster’s Flami-\nneo in The White Devil, or Shakespeare’s Iago, there is also \nan undercurrent of  excitement at the thought that it might \nbe possible to take life entirely into one’s hands, manipulate \npeople and circumstances at will and generally pursue one’s \nselfish goals without a thought for moral codes or eternal \ndamnation: in this sense the Machiavellian villain looks \nahead to the worst of  modern individualism.\nThen there was also, of  course, the contrasting pleasure \nof  seeing the clever schemer ‘hoist with his own petard’. \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   34 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxv\nIntroduction\nAs the years passed and the high tension of  Jacobean tra-\ngedy relaxed into the comedies of  Ben Jonson and his \ncontemporaries, the evil Machiavel became a pathetic fail-\nure whose complacently wicked designs inevitably and \nreassuringly led to his making a fool of  himself. Fading out \nof  British drama in the  mid- seventeenth century , this stock \nfigure is still resurrected from time to time, most recently \nand hilariously in Rowan Atkinson’s Blackadder, a charac-\nter who adds a visceral cowardice to the already long list \nof  Machiavel’s vices.\nTo a great extent, no doubt, it was this identification of  \nMachiavelli’s name with everything that was evil which \nkept The Prince in print and guaranteed that, despite the \npapal ban, it would be widely read. But there was more. \nAs medieval Christianity and scholasticism sank into the \npast and science and reason made their slow , often unwel-\ncome advances, as Europe got used to religious schism and \ncompeting versions of  the truth, the overriding question \nfor any modern ruler inevitably became: how can I con -\nvince people that I have a legitimate, reasonable  right to \nhold power and to govern? In England Charles Stuart \nwould insist on the notion that kings had a divine right, \nthis at a time when so many English monarchs had seized \ntheir crowns by force and cunning. Curiously enough, \nCharles’s great antagonist Cromwell felt that he too had \na direct line to God and legitimacy , but through belief \nand piety rather than family and inheritance. Officially a \n parliamentarian, Cromwell frequently governed without \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   35 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxvi\nIntroduction\nparliament or elections for fear the people might not see \nthings God’s way .\nMeantime, across Europe, the princes and princesses of  \nancient noble families took to marrying and remarrying \neach other in an  ever- thickening web of  defensive alliances, \nas if  density of  blood and lineage might offer protection \nagainst the threat of  usurpers or, worse still, republicanism \nand democracy . No family was more practised at this \nupmarket dating game than the Medici, who, partly thanks \nto an extraordinary network of  connections, would hang \non in Florence in a  client- state twilight lasting more than \n200 undistinguished years. Meantime, from Paris to Madrid \nto Naples, the court clothes became finer, the statues and \nmonuments more pompous and the whole royal charade \nmore colourful and more solemn, as though people might \nsomehow be dazzled into believing that a king or a duke \nreally did have a right to rule. Many prestigious works of  \nart were commissioned with precisely this idea in mind.\nBut most of  all Europe’s rulers worked hard to put a \nhalo round their crowned heads, to appear religious and \nat all costs to uphold the Faith, sensing that this too would \nbolster their position and draw attention away from the \nmystery of  their privileges. Later still, particularly after \nthe French Revolution had destroyed any illusions about \nthe rights of  monarchs, the rather desperate card of \n‘respectability’ was played. Members of  court, Napoleon \nordered, shortly after usurping power, must attend soirées \nwith their wives, to appear respectable and avoid gossip. \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   36 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxvii\nIntroduction\n‘The death of  conversation’, Talleyrand opined. Certainly , \nwhen a leader has to rely on appearing respectable to claim \nlegitimacy , he is on thin ice indeed.\nTo this  long- drawn- out conspiracy of  pomp and pious \ncircumstance, Machiavelli’s little book was a constant \nthreat. It reminded people that power is always up for \ngrabs, always a question of  what can be taken by force or \ntreachery , and always, despite all protests to the contrary , \nthe prime concern of  any ruler. In their attempt to dis -\ncredit The Prince, both religious and state authorities played \nup the author’s admiration for the ruthless Borgia, and \nnever mentioned his perception that in the long run a ruler \nmust avoid being hated by his people and must always put \ntheir interests before those of  the aristocracy; the people \nare so many , Machiavelli reflected, that power ultimately \nlies with them.\nLiberal and  left- wing thinkers were not slow to pick up \non this aspect of  the book. As Rousseau saw it, the whole \nof  The Prince was itself  a Machiavellian ruse: the author \nhad only pretended to give lessons to kings whereas in fact \nhis real aim was to teach people to be free by showing them \nthat royal power was no more than subterfuge. Both Spi-\nnoza and, later, the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo saw it the \nsame way: The Prince was a cautionary tale about how \npower really worked, the underlying intention being to \ndeprive those who held it of  dignity and glamour and teach \nthe people as a whole how to resist it; Machiavelli after all \ndeclared himself  a republican and a libertarian. The \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   37 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nIntroduction\ncommunist leader Antonio Gramsci would even see The \nPrince as looking forward to the dictatorship of  the \nproletariat.\nOthers took a more traditional view: Bertrand Russell \ndescribed The Prince as ‘a handbook for gangsters’, and in \nso doing did no more than repeat the position of  Frederick \nthe Great, who wrote a book to refute Machiavelli and \npresent a more idealistic vision of  monarchical govern -\nment. Others again ( Jakob Burckhardt and Friedrich \nMeinecke) found a space between denigration and admir-\nation to suggest that the novelty of  Machiavelli was to \npresent leadership and  nation- building as creative processes \nthat should be judged not morally but aesthetically; in a \nmanner that looked forward to Nietzsche the charismatic \nleader made a work of  art of  himself  and his government. \nMussolini simply took the book at face value: it was a useful \n‘vade mecum for statesmen’, he enthused.\nBut whatever our interpretation of  his intentions, one \nreaction that Machiavelli never seems to provoke is indif-\nference. Reading The Prince it is impossible not to engage \nwith the disturbing notion that politics cannot be governed \nby the ethical codes that most of  us seek to observe in our \nordinary lives. And however we react to this idea, once we \nhave closed the book it will be very hard to go on thinking \nof  our own leaders in quite the same way as we did before.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   38 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxxxix\nTranslator’s Note\nTranslations have a way of  gathering dust. This isn’t true \nof  an original text. When we read Chaucer or Shakespeare \nwe may need a gloss, or in the case of  Chaucer a modern \ntranslation, but we only look at these things so that we can \nthen enjoy the work as it was first written. And we’re struck \nby its immediacy and freshness, as if  we had been able to \nlearn a foreign language in a very short space of  time with \nlittle effort and maximum reward.\nThis is not the case with an old translation. If  we read \nPope’s translation of  Homer today , we read it because we \nwant to read Pope, not Homer. Linguistically , the transla-\ntion draws our attention more to the language and poetry \nof  our eighteenth century than to Homer or ancient \nGreece.\nSo to attempt a new translation of  Machiavelli is not to \ndismiss previous translations as poor. We are just acknowl-\nedging that these older versions now draw attention to \nthemselves as moments in the English language. My efforts \nof  course will some day meet the same fate. Such distrac-\ntions are particularly unfortunate with Machiavelli, who \ninsisted that he was only interested in style in so far as it \ncould deliver content without frills or distraction. ‘I haven’t \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   39 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxl\nTranslator’s Note\nprettified the book,’ he tells us, ‘or padded it out with long \nsentences or pompous, pretentious words, or any of  the \nirrelevant flourishes and attractions so many writers use; \nI didn’t want it to please for anything but the range and \nseriousness of  its subject matter.’\nI have taken that statement of  intention as my guide in \nthis translation, attempting wherever possible to free the \ntext from the archaisms and corrosive quaintness of  older \nEnglish versions, to get to the essential meaning of  the \noriginal and deliver it, as we say today , but perhaps not \ntomorrow , straight.\nIt isn’t easy . The first problem, and one that sets up all \nthe others, is already there in the title: The Prince. What is \na prince for Machiavelli? Well, a duke is a prince. The pope \nis a prince. A Roman emperor is a prince. The King of  \nFrance is a prince. The Lord of  Imola is a prince.\nThis won’t work in modern English. The English have \nPrince Charles. And the thing about Prince Charles is that \nhe is not King Charles and probably never will be. And \neven if  he were king he would wield no real power, not \neven the kind of  power the pope wields, and we never think \nof  the pope as a king or prince.\nThe only other idea we have of  ‘the prince’, in English, \nis Prince Charming. This concept is a long way from the \nageing Prince Charles and even further from the kind of  \nprince Machiavelli was talking about. Machiavelli’s word \n‘prince’ does not mean ‘the son of  the king’, and even less \n‘an attractive young suitor’. Machiavelli’s ‘principe’ refers \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   40 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxli\nTranslator’s Note\ngenerically to men of  power, men who rule a state. The \nprince is the first, or principal, man.\nSo the translator is tempted to use the word ‘king’. At \nleast in the past a king stood at the apex of  a hierarchical \nsystem, he was the man who mattered. But it is difficult, \ntranslating Machiavelli, to use the word ‘king’ to refer to \nthe lord of  Imola, or a pope, or a Roman emperor. In the \nend, as far as possible, I have resolved this problem by using \nthe rather unattractive word ‘ruler’, or even the more gen-\neric ‘leader’, though always making it clear that we’re \ntalking about the political leader of  a state. The book’s \nfamous title, however, must be left as it is.\nEven harder to solve is the translation of  ‘virtù’, together \nwith a number of  other words that cluster round it. It \nwould be so easy to write the English cognate ‘virtue’, \nmeaning the opposite of  vice, but this is not what Machi-\navelli was talking about. He was not interested in the \npolarity ‘good’/‘evil’, but in winning and losing, strength \nand weakness, success and failure. For Machiavelli ‘virtù’ \nwas any quality of  character that enabled you to take pol-\nitical power or to hold on to it; in short, a winning trait. It \ncould be courage in battle, or strength of  personality , or \npolitical cunning, or it might even be the kind of  ruthless \ncruelty that lets your subjects know you mean business. \nBut one can hardly write ‘cunning’ or ‘cruelty’ for ‘virtù’, \neven if  one knows that in this context that is what the text \nmeans; because then you would lose the sense that \nalthough Machiavelli is not talking about the moral virtues \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   41 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlii\nTranslator’s Note\nhe nevertheless wants to give a positive connotation to the \nparticular qualities he is talking about: this cruelty is aimed \nat solving problems, retaining power, keeping a state \nstrong, hence, in this context it is a ‘virtù’.\nUgly though it may sound, then, I have sometimes been \nobliged to translate ‘virtù’ as ‘positive qualities’ or ‘strength \nof  character’, except of  course on those occasions –  because \nthere are some –  when Machiavelli does mean ‘virtues’ \nin the moral sense: in which case he’s usually talking \nabout the importance of  faking them even if  you may not \nhave them. Faking, of  course, when cunningly deployed \nfor an appropriate end, is another important virtù. The spin \ndoctor was not a notion invented in the 1990s.\nRelated to both these particular problems  –   prince, \nvirtue –  is the more general difficulty that so many of  the \nkey words Machiavelli uses have English cognates through \nLatin –   for tuna, audace, circospetto, malignità, diligente, etc. \nIn some cases they are true cognates –  prudente/prudent, \nfor example –  but even then to use the cognate pulls us \nback to a rather dusty , archaic style. Aren’t the words ‘care-\nful’ or ‘cautious’ or ‘considered’ more often used now than \nthe word ‘prudent’?\nSomething of  the same difficulty can occur where there \nis no cognate in English but a traditional and consolidated \ndictionary equivalent for an old Italian term. Machiavelli \nfrequently uses the word ‘savio’, which has usually been \ntranslated ‘wise’, but again this invites the English version \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   42 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxliii\nTranslator’s Note\nto drift towards that slightly stilted archaic style so often \nused to render great texts from the past; ‘sensible’ or on \nother occasions ‘shrewd’ are choices that, depending on \nthe context, can combine accuracy with a prose that draws \nless attention to itself  as a translation.\nSo the constantly recurring question as one translates \nThe Prince is: what words would we use today to describe \nthe qualities and situations Machiavelli is talking about? \nOf  course sometimes there are no modern words, because \nthere are certain things –  siege engines, cavalry attacks –  that \nwe don’t talk about any more. On the whole, though, \nMachiavelli is chiefly interested in psychology or, rather, in \nthe interaction of  different personalities in crisis situations, \nand here, so long as the translator avoids the temptation \nto introduce misleading contemporary jargon, a great deal \ncan be done to get The Prince into clear, contemporary \nEnglish.\nHowever, the difficulty of  these lexical choices is infin-\nitely compounded by Machiavelli’s wayward grammar and \nextremely flexible syntax. Written in 1513, The Prince is not \neasily comprehensible to Italians today . Recent editions of  \nthe work are usually parallel texts with a modern Italian \ntranslation printed beside the original. The obstacle for the \nItalian reader, however, is hardly lexical at all –  in the end \nhe can understand a good ninety per cent of  the words \nMachiavelli is using –  rather it has to do with a combination \nof  extreme compression of  thought, obsolete, sometimes \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   43 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxliv\nTranslator’s Note\nerratic grammar, and, above all, a syntax where subordin-\nate and  pre- modifying clauses abound in ways that the \nmodern reader is not used to.\nWe are not talking here about those complex but always \nelegant Ciceronian sentences so admired and frequently \nmimicked by the English Augustans. Machiavelli has a \nmore spoken, flexible, persuading, sometimes brusque \nvoice, and to get that tone in English one has to opt for a \nsyntax that is quite different from the original Italian. In \nparticular, the sequence with which information is deliv-\nered within the sentence frequently has to be reorganized. \nHere, to give the reader a sense of  what he can expect, are \nthree versions of  the same paragraph, the last being my \nown. I haven’t chosen anything especially complex; it’s a \nfairly ordinary passage in which, as so often, Machiavelli \nposes a situation, then considers possible responses to it \nand the consequences of  each response. The first transla-\ntion is from W . K. Marriot and was published in 1908.\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend \nor a downright enemy , that is to say , when, without any \nreservation, he declares himself  in favour of  one party \nagainst the other; which course will always be more advan-\ntageous than standing neutral; because if  two of  your \npowerful neighbours come to blows, they are of  such a \ncharacter that, if  one of  them conquers, you have either \nto fear him or not. In either case it will always be more \nadvantageous for you to declare yourself  and to make war \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   44 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlv\nTranslator’s Note\nstrenuously; because, in the first case, if  you do not declare \nyourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, \nto the pleasure and satisfaction of  him who has been con-\nquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything \nto protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does \nnot want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time \nof  trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because \nyou did not willingly , sword in hand, court his fate.\nThe second is from George Bull, published in 1961.\nA prince also wins prestige for being a true friend or a \ntrue enemy , that is, for revealing himself  without any \nreservation in favour of  one side against another. This pol-\nicy is always more advantageous than neutrality . For \ninstance, if  the powers neighbouring on you come to \nblows, either they are such that, if  one of  them conquers, \nyou will be in danger, or they are not. In either case it will \nalways be to your advantage to declare yourself  and to \nwage a vigorous war; because, in the first case, if  you do \nnot declare yourself  you will always be at the mercy of  the \nconqueror, much to the pleasure and satisfaction of  the one \nwho has been beaten, and you will have no justification \nnor any way to obtain protection or refuge. The conqueror \ndoes not want doubtful friends who do not help him when \nhe is in difficulties; the loser repudiates you because you \nwere unwilling to go, arms in hand, and throw in your \nlot with him.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   45 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlvi\nTranslator’s Note\nAnd here is my own.\nA ruler will also be respected when he is a genuine friend \nand a genuine enemy , that is, when he declares himself  \nunambiguously for one side and against the other. This \npolicy will always bring better results than neutrality . For \nexample, if  you have two powerful neighbours who go to \nwar, you may or may not have reason to fear the winner \nafterwards. Either way it will always be better to take sides \nand fight hard. If  you do have cause to fear but stay neutral, \nyou’ll still be gobbled up by the winner to the amusement \nand satisfaction of  the loser; you’ll have no excuses, no \ndefence and nowhere to hide. Because a winner doesn’t \nwant  half- hearted friends who don’t help him in a crisis; \nand the loser will have nothing to do with you since you \ndidn’t choose to fight alongside him and share his fate.\nA typically tricky moment in this passage comes when \nMachiavelli says of  these neighbouring powers:\n. . . o sono di qualità che, vincendo uno di quelli, tu abbia \na temere del vincitore, o no.\nLiterally:\n. . . either they are of  qualities that, winning one of  those, \nyou ought to fear the winner, or not.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   46 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlvii\nTranslator’s Note\nHere Marriot gives:\n. . . they are of  such a character that, if  one of  them con-\nquers, you have either to fear him or not.\nAnd Bull:\n. . . either they are such that, if  one of  them conquers, you \nwill be in danger, or they are not.\nHere it’s clear that Bull is closer to modern prose, yet \none still feels that nobody writing down this idea today \nin English would introduce the second part of  Machiavelli’s \nalternative as Bull does by tagging that ‘or they are not’ on \nto the end of  the sentence after the introduction of  an ‘if ’ \nclause. If  we follow Bull’s general structure but move \nthe alternative forward  –  thus, ‘either they are or they \naren’t such that if  one of  them conquers, you will be in \ndanger’ –  the sentence gains in fluency . In the end, however, \nthe simplest solution seemed to me to shift the alternative \naspect towards the verb ‘fear’ and away from a description \nof  the two states; this leaves the sense of  the sentence intact \nand allows us to get closer to the original’s telegraphic \ndelivery .\n. . . you may or may not have reason to fear the winner \nafterwards.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   47 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlviii\nTranslator’s Note\nLet me say at this point that I have the greatest respect \nfor both these earlier translations and indeed various \nothers. I owe a lot to them, because, although I have always \ntranslated directly from the original, I have then gone \nto these and to the modern Italian translations to see \nwhere they disagree and to mull over what I can learn from \nthem. The original text is such that on occasion all four \nof  the translations I have been looking at, two English and \ntwo Italian, offer different interpretations. In these cases \none really must attune oneself  to Machiavelli’s mental pro-\ncesses, his insistence on logic, reason and deduction, and \nremember that every clause, if  not every word, is there for \na purpose.\nHere is a small example. Having stated that rulers must \nat all costs avoid being hated by their subjects, and that \nsuch hatred is almost always the cause of  a leader’s down-\nfall, Machiavelli foresees that some people will object that \nthis wasn’t the case with many Roman emperors who \neither held on to power despite being hated by the people, \nor lost it despite being loved. ‘To meet these objections’, \nhe tells us, ‘I shall consider the qualities of  some of  these \nemperors, showing how the causes of  their downfall are \nnot at all out of  line with my reasoning above.’ So far so \ngood, but this sentence then ends:\n. . . e parte metterò in considerazione quelle cose che sono \nnotabili a chi legge le azioni di quelli tempi.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   48 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nxlix\nTranslator’s Note\nTranslating word for word, this gives:\n. . . and part I will put in consideration those things that \nare important to people who read the events of  those times.\nWhat is this about? Why did Machiavelli feel the need to \nadd these words to a sentence that already seems clear \nenough. Bull offers:\n. . . I shall submit for consideration examples which are \nwell known to students of  the period.\nThis may sound sensible and vaguely academic, but it \nsimply isn’t accurate: the word ‘parte’ has gone; to ‘submit \nfor consideration’ may be a standard English formula, but \ndoes it mean the same as Machiavelli’s actually rather \nunusual ‘put in consideration’? ‘Notabile’ doesn’t so much \nmean ‘well known’ as ‘worthy of  note’ or ‘important’. Mar-\nriot gives:\n. . . at the same time I will only submit for consideration \nthose things that are noteworthy to him who studies the \naffairs of  those times.\nAgain we have the standard ‘submit for consideration’, \nwhile ‘at the same time’ and ‘only’ are both translator’s \nadditions. It now sounds as if  Machiavelli is reassuring us \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   49 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nl\nTranslator’s Note\nthat he will only look at examples that are relevant, but \nthis sort of  defensiveness is not the author’s way . Why \nwould the reader have suspected him of  introducing irrele-\nvant examples?\nOne modern Italian translation gives: ‘e in parte indi -\ncherò quei fatti che sono important per chi si interessa alla \nstoria di quei tempi.’ Literally: ‘and in part I will indicate \nthose facts that are important for people interested in the \nhistory of  those times.’\nThis is now extremely close to our literal translation of  \nMachiavelli’s original but still not particularly helpful. \nWhat is the author getting at? What does the phrase add \nto what has already been said?\nAnother Italian translation gives: ‘nello stesso tempo \nindicherò i fatti che devono essere messi in evidenza da chi \nsi interessa alla storia di quei tempi.’ Literally: ‘at the same \ntime I will indicate the facts that must be put in evidence \nby people interested in the history of  those times.’\nDespite the fact that ‘parte’ has once again been mysteri-\nously transformed into ‘at the same time’ –  a classic filler \nwhen a translator is lost –  an idea at last emerges: that there \nare facts that people interested in those times ‘must put in \nevidence’, and the implication is that without these facts \nwe won’t understand what has to be understood if  we are \nto be persuaded by the author’s argument.\nAt this point the translator tries to enter Machiavelli’s \nreasoning, reassured by the knowledge that here we have \nan author who always put sense and clarity before anything \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   50 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nli\nTranslator’s Note\nelse. Machiavelli, remember, is facing objections from \npeople who claim that the question of  whether a ruler’s \npeople do or do not hate him is not the crucial criterion \nwhen it comes to considering whether that leader will sur-\nvive. Those objections, what’s more, are based on the lives \nof  certain Roman emperors. What Machiavelli is going \nto show in the following paragraphs is that the nature \nof power and political institutions in the Roman empire \nwas profoundly different from that in a modern (early \n sixteenth- century) state, the key difference being the exist\n-\nence, in Roman times, of  a strong standing army that, for \nsafety’s sake, a leader had to satisfy before satisfying the \npeople and that could often only be kept happy by allowing \nit to treat the people very harshly , stealing and raping at \nwill. What this little clause appears to be doing, then, is \npreparing us for Machiavelli’s approach to answering the \nobjection that has been raised: it is a question, he is going \nto tell us, of  understanding a different historical context.\nThe word ‘parte’ could be short for ‘a parte’ (apart, sep-\narately) or ‘in parte’ (in part), as both the Italian translations \ntake it. Now perhaps we can read the sentence as a whole \nthus:\nTo meet these objections, I shall consider the qualities of  \nsome of  these emperors, showing how the causes of  their \ndownfall are not at all out of  line with my reasoning above, \nand bringing into the argument some of  the context that \nhistorians of  the period consider important.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   51 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nlii\nTranslator’s Note\nThe original ‘mettere in considerazione’ (‘put in consider-\nation’) is used only once in the whole of  The Prince (having \nthe text in electronic form is a huge help to the translator), \nhence the decision not to translate with a standard formula \nsuch as ‘submit for consideration’, but to give a more pre-\ncise sense to the words with the expression ‘bringing into \nthe argument’: Machiavelli is advising us that for these \nparticular examples he will have to fill in a different context. \nThe idea of  ‘parte’ I have understood as ‘in part’, and then \nfor the sake of  fluency rendered it with ‘some’: the author \ncan’t bring in all the context, but some of  it.\nOne has no way of  knowing whether this is exactly what \nMachiavelli meant, but the sentence now gives an internal \ncohesion to the passage that was lacking in other versions. \nAnd if  we return to our  word- for- word translation of  the \noriginal – ‘and part I will put in consideration those things \nthat are important to people who read the events of  those \ntimes’ –  we see that it can indeed be read in the way we \nhave chosen to render it.\nOne particularly pernicious problem a translator faces as \nhe grapples with The Prince is the book’s reputation. Machi-\navelli is a scandal, every schoolboy knows, because he puts \nthe ends before the means to the point of  condoning acts \nof  violence, cruelty and betrayal, something Christian and \nmodern western ethics consider unacceptable: we don’t \ncondone a brutal killing just because it puts an end to a \nriot and we are no longer at ease with the idea of  torture, \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   52 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nliii\nTranslator’s Note\neven when it might prevent a terrorist atrocity . The climax \nof  this scandal comes with the author’s discussion of \nCesare Borgia, a man who rose to power and kept it with \nthe use of  extraordinary treachery and cruelty . The temp-\ntation for the translator is to play to the reputation of  the \nbook, underlining Machiavelli’s extreme views and making \nsure the text doesn’t ‘disappoint’, even when its tone and \nsubtlety are not, perhaps, exactly what readers were \nexpecting.\nAt the end of  the discussion of  Borgia, having recounted \nhow he eventually lost power when his father, Pope Alex-\nander, suddenly and unexpectedly died and a pope hostile \nto Borgia was elected, Machiavelli writes: ‘Raccolte io \nadunque tutte le azioni del duca, non saprei riprenderlo.’ \nLiterally , we have: ‘Having gathered then all the actions of  \nthe duke, I would not know how to reproach him.’\nBull gives: ‘So having summed up all that the duke did, \nI cannot possibly censure him.’ Here the word ‘censure’ \nhas a strong moral connotation, and the statement is made \nstronger still by the introduction of  ‘can’t possibly’, which \nseems a heavy interpretation of  the standard Italian for -\nmula ‘I wouldn’t know how to’. In Bull’s version it seems \nthat Machiavelli is making a point of  telling us that he has \nno moral objections to anything Cesare Borgia did, this in \nline with the author’s reputation for cynicism.\nMarriot more cautiously gives: ‘When all the actions of  \nthe duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him’, \nand both Italian translations take the same line.

    "raw_text": "liv\nTranslator’s Note\nis that just as the word ‘virtù is rarely used in a strictly moral \ncontext, so the word ‘riprendere’, ‘reproach’, refers not to \nmoral behaviour, but to the question: did the duke get \nsomething wrong, did he make a mistake? A key to reading \nthe word comes at the opening to the next paragraph \nwhere we have: ‘Solamente si può accusarlo nella creazione \ndi Iulio pontefice, nella quale lui ebbe mala elezione’, \nwhich, more or less literally , gives us: ‘The only thing Bor-\ngia can be accused of  is his role in the election of  Pope \nJulius, where he made a bad choice’ (that is, as far as his \nown interests were concerned, he backed the wrong man).\nHere we approach the subtler scandal of  Machiavelli’s \ntext: it is not that the author is insisting  that Borgia’s \nimmoral acts should not be censured, rather that Machi-\navelli is just not interested in discussing the moral aspect \nof  the question at all, or not from a Christian point of  view . \nFor him it is a case of  shrewd or mistaken choices, not of  \ngood or evil. When he proposes Borgia as a model, neither \nmorality nor immorality come into it, only the fact that \nthis man knew how to win power and hold it and build a \nstrong state.\nFinally , one can’t help noticing a certain Victorian bashful-\nness in previous translations. Machiavelli was a notorious \nwomanizer and in writing The Prince he believed he was \naddressing an audience of  men who had no worries about \npolitical correctness. When he says ‘la fortuna è donna, et \nè necessario, volendola tenere sotto, batterla et urtarla’ –   \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   54 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nlv\nTranslator’s Note\nliterally: ‘fortune is woman and it is necessary wanting to \nkeep her underneath to beat her and shove her’ –  there is \nan obvious sexual reference. The phrase comes in the last \nparagraph of  The Prince proper (the closing exhortation is \nvery much a piece apart) and Machiavelli wants to go out \non a strong but, as he no doubt saw it, witty note.\nHere is Marriot’s version of  the whole last paragraph:\nI conclude, therefore, that fortune being changeful and \nmankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in \nagreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they \nfall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be adven-\nturous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if  \nyou wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and  ill- use \nher; and it is seen that she allows herself  to be mastered \nby the adventurous rather than by those who go to work \nmore coldly . She is, therefore, always,  woman- like, a lover \nof  young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, \nand with more audacity command her.\nAnd Bull’s:\nI conclude, therefore, that as fortune is changeable whereas \nmen are obstinate in their ways, men prosper so long as \nfortune and policy are in accord, and where there is a clash \nthey fail. I hold strongly to this: that it is better to be impetu-\nous than circumspect; because fortune is a woman and if  \nshe is to be submissive it is necessary to beat and coerce \n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   55 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nTranslator’s Note\nher. Experience shows that she is more often subdued by \nmen who do this than by those who act coldly . Always, \nbeing a woman, she favours young men, because they are \nless circumspect and more ardent, and because they com-\nmand her with greater audacity .\nI hope I am getting closer to the spirit of  the thing and, for \nbetter or worse, the kind of  man Machiavelli was, offering \nthis:\nTo conclude then: fortune varies but men go on regardless. \nWhen their approach suits the times they’re successful, and \nwhen it doesn’t they’re not. My opinion on the matter is \nthis: it’s better to be impulsive than cautious; fortune is \nfemale and if  you want to stay on top of  her you have to \nslap and thrust. You’ll see she’s more likely to yield that way \nthan to men who go about her coldly . And being a woman \nshe likes her men young, because they’re not so cagey , \nthey’re wilder and more daring when they master her.\n9780141395876_ThePrince_PRE.indd   56 21/05/15   3:00 PM\n\f\nDUCHY OF\nSA VOY\nKINGDOM OF\n                 NAPLES\n0 100 Miles\n0 150 Km50 100\n50\nRome\nNaples\nMessina\nKINGDOM OF\nSICILY\nTyrrhenian\nSea\nKINGDOM OF\nSARDINIA\nN\nGenoa\nBologna\nPadua\nVenice\nFlorence\n           PAPAL\nSTATESCORSICA\nREP.

Eager myself to bring\nYour Highness some token of my loyalty, I realized there was\nnothing more precious or important to me than my know-\nledge of great men and their doings, a knowledge gained\nthrough long experience of contemporary affairs and a con-\nstant study of ancient history. Having thought over all I’ve\nlearned, and analysed it with the utmost care, I’ve written\neverything down in a short book that I am now sending to\nYour Highness.\nAnd though this gift is no doubt unworthy of you, I feel\nsure the experience it contains will make it welcome,\nespecially when you think that I could hardly offer anything\nbetter than the chance to grasp in a few hours what I have\ndiscovered and assimilated over many years of danger and\ndiscomfort. I haven’t prettiﬁed the book or padded it out with\nlong sentences or pompous, pretentious words, or any of the\nirrelevant ﬂourishes and attractions so many writers use; I\ndidn’t want it to please for anything but the range and serious-\nness of its subject matter.

So\nwhile the ﬁrst time Louis invaded Milan it took no more than\na little sword-rattling along the borders from Ludovico to\nforce a retreat, the second time it would take the whole world\nto defeat his armies and drive them out of Italy. This for the\nreasons listed above. All the same, they were driven out both\ntimes.\nThe general reasons behind the ﬁrst French defeat have\nbeen discussed. It remains to explain why Louis lost Milan\nthe second time and to see what counter-measures he could\nhave taken and what options a ruler has in a situation like\nthis if he wants to hold on to his conquest.\nNeedless to say, any territory annexed to the realm of a\nconquering ruler may or may not be in the same geographical\nregion and share the same language. If it is and the language\nis shared, the territory will be much easier to hold on to,\nespecially if its people are not used to the freedom of self-\ngovernment. In that case all you have to do is eliminate the\nfamily of the previous ruler and your hold on power is guaran-\nteed. Everything else in the territory can then be left as it was\nand, given that there are no profound differences in customs,\npeople will accept the situation quietly enough.

In this way the acquired territory and\nthe king’s original possessions will soon form a single entity.\nBut when a ruler occupies a state in an area that has a\ndifferent language, different customs and different insti-\ntutions, then things get tough. To hold on to a new possession\nin these circumstances takes a lot of luck and hard work.\nPerhaps the most effective solution is for the new ruler to go\nand live there himself. This will improve security and make\nthe territory more stable. The Turkish sultan did this in\nGreece, and all the other measures he took to hold on to the\ncountry would have been ineffective if he hadn’t. When you’re\nactually there, you can see when things start going wrong and\nnip rebellion in the bud; when you’re far away you only ﬁnd\nout about it when it’s too late. Another advantage is that the\nnew territory won’t be plundered by your ofﬁcials. Its subjects\nwill be happy that they can appeal to a ruler who is living\namong them. So, if they’re intending to be obedient, they’ll\nhave one more reason to love you, and if they’re not, all the\nmore reason to fear you. Anyone planning an attack from\noutside will think twice about it. So, if you go and live in the\nnew territory you’ve taken, you’re very unlikely to lose it.\nAnother good solution is to establish colonies in one or\ntwo places. These work rather like chains to bind the captured\nstate to your own. If you don’t do this you’ll have to keep\nlarge numbers of infantry and cavalry in the territory.\nColonies don’t cost a great deal. You can send and maintain\nthem very cheaply and they only arouse the hostility of the\npeople whose houses and land are expropriated to give to the\ncolonists.

They\nnever put off a war when they saw trouble coming; they knew\nit couldn’t be avoided in the long run and that the odds would\nsimply shift in favour of their enemies. They chose to ﬁght\nPhilip and Antiochus in Greece, so as not to have to ﬁght them\nin Italy. They could have put off both wars, but they didn’t.\nThey never took the line our pundits are constantly giving us\ntoday – relax, time is on your side – but rather they put their\nfaith in their own foresight and spirit. Time hurries everything\non and can just as easily make things worse as better.\nBut let’s get back to the King of France and see if he took\nany of the measures we’ve been discussing. And when I say\nthe King, I mean Louis, not Charles, since Louis held territory\nin Italy for longer than Charles and it’s easier to see what his\nmethods were. You’ll notice that he did the opposite of what\na ruler must do to hold on to conquests in a region whose\ncustoms and language differ from those of his home kingdom.\nIt was Venetian ambitions that brought Louis into Italy.\nThe Venetians planned to take half of Lombardy while he\nseized the other half. I’m not going to criticize Louis for\nagreeing to this. He wanted to get a ﬁrst foothold in Italy, he\ndidn’t have any friends in the region – on the contrary, thanks\nto King Charles’s behaviour before him, all doors were barred\n– so he was forced to accept what allies he found. And the\narrangement would have worked if he hadn’t made mistakes\nin other departments. Taking Lombardy, the king recovered\nin one blow the reputation that Charles had lost. Genoa\nsurrendered. The Florentines offered an alliance. The Marquis\nof Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, Bentivogli of Bologna,\nCaterina Sforza of Forlı`, the lords of Faenza, Pesaro, Rimini,\nCamerino and Piombino, as well as the republics of Lucca,\nPisa and Siena, all queued up to make friends. At which point\nthe Venetians were in a position to see how rash they had\nbeen when they proposed the initial deal: for two towns in\nLombardy they had made Louis king over a third of Italy.\nmixed monarchies 1 3\nThink how easily Louis could have held on to his position\nin Italy if he had observed the rules outlined above and\nguaranteed security and protection to all those friends. There\nwere so many of them and they were so weak and frightened,\neither of Venice or Rome, that they were simply forced to side\nwith Louis. Then with their help he could easily have defended\nhimself against the states that were still powerful. But no\nsooner had he arrived in Milan than Louis did the opposite;\nhe helped Pope Alexander to invade Romagna. He didn’t see\nthat this decision weakened his own position, losing him\nfriends and the support of those who had run to him for help,\nwhile reinforcing the pope, adding temporal dominion to the\nspiritual power that already gives a pope so much authority.\nHaving made that ﬁrst mistake, he was dragged in deeper,\nsince, to curb Alexander’s ambitions and prevent him from\ntaking control of Tuscany, he was forced to advance further\ninto Italy himself. Not content with having lost his friends\nand increased the power of the Church, he was eager now to\nget hold of the Kingdom of Naples and so made an agreement\nto split it with the King of Spain.

They\nnever put off a war when they saw trouble coming; they knew\nit couldn’t be avoided in the long run and that the odds would\nsimply shift in favour of their enemies. They chose to ﬁght\nPhilip and Antiochus in Greece, so as not to have to ﬁght them\nin Italy. They could have put off both wars, but they didn’t.\nThey never took the line our pundits are constantly giving us\ntoday – relax, time is on your side – but rather they put their\nfaith in their own foresight and spirit. Time hurries everything\non and can just as easily make things worse as better.\nBut let’s get back to the King of France and see if he took\nany of the measures we’ve been discussing. And when I say\nthe King, I mean Louis, not Charles, since Louis held territory\nin Italy for longer than Charles and it’s easier to see what his\nmethods were. You’ll notice that he did the opposite of what\na ruler must do to hold on to conquests in a region whose\ncustoms and language differ from those of his home kingdom.\nIt was Venetian ambitions that brought Louis into Italy.\nThe Venetians planned to take half of Lombardy while he\nseized the other half. I’m not going to criticize Louis for\nagreeing to this. He wanted to get a ﬁrst foothold in Italy, he\ndidn’t have any friends in the region – on the contrary, thanks\nto King Charles’s behaviour before him, all doors were barred\n– so he was forced to accept what allies he found. And the\narrangement would have worked if he hadn’t made mistakes\nin other departments. Taking Lombardy, the king recovered\nin one blow the reputation that Charles had lost. Genoa\nsurrendered. The Florentines offered an alliance. The Marquis\nof Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, Bentivogli of Bologna,\nCaterina Sforza of Forlı`, the lords of Faenza, Pesaro, Rimini,\nCamerino and Piombino, as well as the republics of Lucca,\nPisa and Siena, all queued up to make friends. At which point\nthe Venetians were in a position to see how rash they had\nbeen when they proposed the initial deal: for two towns in\nLombardy they had made Louis king over a third of Italy.\nmixed monarchies 1 3\nThink how easily Louis could have held on to his position\nin Italy if he had observed the rules outlined above and\nguaranteed security and protection to all those friends. There\nwere so many of them and they were so weak and frightened,\neither of Venice or Rome, that they were simply forced to side\nwith Louis. Then with their help he could easily have defended\nhimself against the states that were still powerful. But no\nsooner had he arrived in Milan than Louis did the opposite;\nhe helped Pope Alexander to invade Romagna. He didn’t see\nthat this decision weakened his own position, losing him\nfriends and the support of those who had run to him for help,\nwhile reinforcing the pope, adding temporal dominion to the\nspiritual power that already gives a pope so much authority.\nHaving made that ﬁrst mistake, he was dragged in deeper,\nsince, to curb Alexander’s ambitions and prevent him from\ntaking control of Tuscany, he was forced to advance further\ninto Italy himself. Not content with having lost his friends\nand increased the power of the Church, he was eager now to\nget hold of the Kingdom of Naples and so made an agreement\nto split it with the King of Spain. Until then Louis had been the\ndominant power in Italy, but this move introduced another\nequally great power into the peninsula, with the result that\nanyone in the region who had ambitions or was disgruntled\nwith Louis now had someone else to turn to. Louis could\nhave kept Naples under a client king but instead he kicked\nthe man out and brought in a king who was powerful enough\nto kick him out.\nThe desire to conquer more territory really is a very natural,\nordinary thing and whenever men have the resources to do\nso they’ll always be praised, or at least not blamed.

Sharing Lombardy with the Venetians was\nforgivable, in that it gave him a foothold in Italy; but there\nwas nothing necessary about sharing Naples with Spain and\nhence it was a mistake.\nSo Louis made ﬁve mistakes: he eliminated the weaker\nstates; he enhanced the power of one of Italy’s stronger states;\nhe brought in an extremely powerful foreign king; he didn’t\ngo to live in the territory he’d acquired and he didn’t establish\ncolonies there.\nAll the same, these mistakes might not have done serious\ndamage during his lifetime had he not now made a sixth by\nstripping Venice of its power. Of course, if he hadn’t increased\nthe pope’s power and brought Spain into Italy, it would have\nbeen quite reasonable and even necessary to cut the Venetians\ndown to size. But having taken those earlier decisions, he\nshould never have reduced Venice to such a state of weakness.\nAs long as Venice was militarily strong, no one else was\ngoing to try to take Lombardy from the French; the Venetians\nwouldn’t have allowed another state to attack the region\nunless they were going to get territory themselves and the\nother states would never have wanted to take Lombardy from\nFrance if it meant giving it to Venice; plus, they would never\nhave had the courage to confront France and Venice together.\nSomeone might object: but Louis gave Romagna to Pope\nAlexander and Naples to Spain to avoid war; in which case,\nlet me repeat what I said earlier: you must never fail to respond\nto trouble just to avoid war, because in the end you won’t\navoid it, you’ll just be putting it off to your enemy’s advan-\ntage. Someone else might insist that Louis had promised\nthe pope he would attack Venice on his behalf in return for\nthe pope’s granting the French king a divorce and making the\nArchbishop of Rouen a cardinal; in this case let me refer the\nreader to what I’ll be saying later about when rulers should,\nor then again shouldn’t, keep their promises.\nSo Louis lost Lombardy because he didn’t take the measures\nmixed monarchies 1 5\nothers have taken when they conquered territory and were\ndetermined to hold on to it. There’s nothing mysterious about\nthis; it’s all very normal and reasonable. In fact I discussed\nthe matter in Nantes with the Cardinal of Rouen when Duke\nValentino (that was what people used to call Cesare Borgia,\nPope Alexander’s son) was invading Romagna; and when the\ncardinal told me that the Italians knew nothing about war, I\ntold him that the French knew nothing about politics, because\nif they did they wouldn’t be letting the pope grow so powerful.\nAnd as it turned out, it was Rome and Spain, the two states\nwhose power in Italy France had built up, that proved\nFrance’s downfall. From which we can infer a general rule\nthat always holds, or almost always: that to help another ruler\nto grow powerful is to prepare your own ruin; because it\ntakes ﬂair or military strength to build up a new power, and\nboth will seem threatening to the person who has beneﬁted\nfrom them.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   14 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n1 4 the prince\nanother king.

Why not?\nNow that we’ve seen how difﬁcult it is to hold on to recently\nacquired territory some readers will be surprised to recall\nwhat happened when Alexander the Great conquered Asia in\njust a few years, then died very soon after his victory was\ncomplete. You would have thought the whole area would\nhave rebelled, yet Alexander’s successors held on to it and\nthe only trouble they had arose from their own personal\nambitions and inﬁghting. To explain this situation let’s start\nby remembering that all monarchies on record have been\ngoverned in one of two ways: either by a king and the servants\nhe appoints as ministers to run his kingdom; or by a king and\na number of barons, who are not appointed by the king\nbut hold their positions thanks to hereditary privilege. These\nbarons have their own lands and their own subjects who\nrecognize the barons as their masters and are naturally loyal\nto them. Where a state is governed by a king and his ministers\nthe king is more powerful since he is the only person in the\nstate whom people recognize as superior. When they obey\nsomeone else it is only because he is a minister or ofﬁcial and\nthey have no special loyalty to him.\nExamples of these two forms of government in our own\ntimes are Turkey and France. The whole of Turkey is gov-\nerned by one ruler, or sultan. Everyone serves him. He divides\nhis realm into provinces, or sanjaks, and sends administrators\nto run them, appointing and dismissing them as he sees ﬁt.\nwhy the kingdom of darius did not rebel 1 7\nThe King of France, on the other hand, is surrounded by any\nnumber of barons whose rights date back to ancient times\nand who are acknowledged and loved by their subjects. Each\nbaron has speciﬁc privileges which a king can only take away\nat his peril. Looking at these two kinds of states, it’s clear\nthat Turkey is hard to conquer but once conquered very easy\nto hold. France on the other hand will be somewhat easier to\nconquer but very hard to hold.\nThe reason why it’s hard to conquer a country like Turkey\nis that there are no barons to invite you in and you can’t expect\nanyone to make your invasion easier by rebelling against the\nking. This follows naturally from the situation as described\nabove; since all subjects are the king’s servants and indebted\nto him it’s hard to corrupt them, and even assuming you do\nmanage to bribe someone he’s not likely to be much help\nbecause he can’t bring any local people along with him, this\nagain for the reasons I’ve explained. So, anyone attacking this\nkind of country has to reckon that he will ﬁnd it united against\nhim and hence has to rely on his own armed forces rather\nthan on any mutiny in enemy ranks. But once you have won\nand routed the enemy and made sure he can’t rebuild his\narmies, then the only thing to worry about is the king and his\nfamily. Eliminate them and no one else can threaten you since\nno one commands the loyalty of the people. Just as before\nyour victory you couldn’t look to any barons for help, so\nafter it there are none around to pose a threat.\nThe opposite is true in countries run along French lines.\nHere you can make inroads easily enough, winning the sup-\nport of a baron or two. There’s always someone unhappy\nwith the king and eager for change. Then these people are\nwell placed to get you a foothold in the country and help you\nto victory. But afterwards you’re going to have all kinds of\nproblems holding on to what you’ve won, problems with the\npeople who fought on your side and problems with those who\nfought against you and lost.

So Alexander ﬁrst had to\ndefeat its entire army and get control of the country; but once\nhe’d done that, and once Darius was dead, he was securely in\ncommand for the reasons cited above. And if his successors\nhad been united they could have run the region without any\nworries; in fact the only trouble was the inﬁghting they started\nthemselves. But states organized the French way can never be\nheld so easily. The frequent uprisings against Roman power\nin Spain, Gaul and Greece, for example, were the result of\nthose regions’ being internally divided into so many princi-\npalities. So long as people remembered their old loyalties to\nlocal lords, Rome was never in complete control. But once\nthe power and permanence of empire had extinguished those\nloyalties, then Rome became the undisputed master of the\nregion. In fact, when the Romans started ﬁghting among\nthemselves, each warring commander was able to bring the\nprovince he was running into the conﬂict on his side, since\nonce the families of the old local rulers had been eliminated\nthe only authority people recognized was Rome’s representa-\ntive. When you take all this into account, it’s really not sur-\nprising how easy it was for Alexander to hold Asia, nor how\nhard it was for many others, Pyrrhus for example, to hold on\nto the territories they took. It wasn’t a question of the abilities\nof each particular conqueror, but of the different kinds of\nstate they had invaded.\n5\nHow to govern cities and states that were\npreviously self-governing\nWhen the states you invade have been accustomed to gov-\nerning themselves without a monarch and living in freedom\nunder their own laws, then there are three ways of holding\non to them: the ﬁrst is to reduce them to rubble; the second\nis to go and live there yourself; the third is to let them go on\nliving under their own laws, make them pay you a tax and\ninstall a government of just a few local people to keep the\nstate as a whole friendly. Since this government has been set\nup by the invading ruler, its members know they can’t survive\nwithout his support and will do everything they can to defend\nhis authority. Once you’ve decided not to destroy it, the best\nway to hold a previously self-governing city is with the help\nof its own citizens.\nLet’s take our examples from Sparta and Rome. The Spartans\nheld Athens and Thebes by setting up governments run by a\nfew local people, but in the end they lost these towns. The\nRomans razed Capua, Carthage and Numantia to the ground\nand that way held on to them. They tried to hold Greece\nin much the same way the Spartans had, granting it self-\ngovernment and leaving it its own laws, but it didn’t work\nand eventually they were forced to destroy quite a number of\ncities so as to keep hold of the region as a whole.\nThe truth is that the only sure way to hold such places is\nto destroy them.

The people I have in mind are\nFrancesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia. With the right policies\nand great courage, Sforza, a commoner, became Duke of\nMilan and, having won power with enormous effort, held\non to it easily enough. Borgia, on the other hand, or Duke\nValentino as he was commonly known, received his territories\nthanks to his father’s position, and when his father died he\nlost them, this despite the fact that he used all means available\nand did everything a sensible, capable man could have done\nto lay the foundations for his own rule in the lands that\nanother man’s army and position had won for him. As we\nsaid earlier on, if you haven’t laid the foundations before\nbecoming king, it takes very special qualities to do it after-\nwards, and even then it’ll be tough for the architect and risky\nfor the building. If we look carefully at Borgia’s strategies,\nwe’ll see that he did in fact lay down good foundations for\nfuture power; and I think it makes sense to discuss how he\ndid it, because I wouldn’t know what better advice to give a\nruler new to power than to follow his example. If his efforts\neventually came to nothing, it was not due to his own short-\ncomings, but to an extraordinary run of bad luck.\nWhen Pope Alexander VI decided to turn his son into a\npowerful duke, he faced all kinds of obstacles, present and\nfuture. First, he couldn’t see how he could make him ruler of\nanywhere that wasn’t Church territory. But he knew that if he\ngave away Church land, the Duke of Milan and the Venetians\nwould block him, since Faenza and Rimini were already under\nVenetian protection. What’s more, the armies then operating\nin Italy, particularly those the pope might have called on for\nstates won by lucky circumstance 2 7\nhelp, were all controlled by people – the Orsini, the Colonna\nand associated families – who had reason to fear papal expan-\nsionism, and hence couldn’t be trusted. What Alexander had\nto do then was undermine the status quo and the authority of\nhis rivals so as to seize control of part of their lands with\nimpunity. This turned out to be easy because, for reasons all\ntheir own, the Venetians were now determined to bring the\nFrench back into Italy. Rather than opposing the move, the\npope smoothed the way by dissolving King Louis’s ﬁrst\nmarriage for him.\nSo the French king entered Italy with Venetian help and\npapal consent. No sooner had he taken Milan than the pope\ngot the king to send troops to help his son, Borgia, take\nRomagna, something that would have been impossible with-\nout Louis’s support. With the forces of the Colonna family\nnow beaten, Borgia faced two obstacles if he was to hold on\nto Romagna and acquire further territory: the ﬁrst was his\nown army, which he suspected of disloyalty; the second was\nFrench policy. Duke Valentino had been using the forces of\nthe Orsini family but was afraid they would stop obeying his\norders, preventing him from making new gains and perhaps\ndepriving him of the old. And he had the same worries about\nthe King of France. His doubts about the Orsinis were con-\nﬁrmed when, after taking Faenza, he attacked Bologna, and\nsaw the soldiers anything but enthusiastic. Louis’s position\nbecame clear when, having taken Urbino, Borgia advanced\ntowards Tuscany only to have the French king insist he turn\nback. After that he decided never to rely on other people’s\narmies and authority again.\nSo ﬁrst of all he weakened the Orsini and Colonna factions\nin Rome by luring the noblemen who supported them over\nto his side with generous salaries and military and political\nappointments in line with each man’s rank.

The ferocity of the spectacle left people both\ngratiﬁed and shocked.\nBut let’s get back to where we left off. Borgia had consoli-\ndated his power and secured himself against most immediate\ndangers, building up an army of his own and seeing off the\nmajority of the other armies that had been near enough to\nattack him. At this point the only obstacle to further expan-\nsion was the King of France. Borgia knew the king had real-\nized he’d made a mistake supporting him earlier on and hence\nwould not put up with further adventures. So he began to\nlook around for new alliances and was less than generous in\nhis support when Louis marched south to ﬁght the Spanish\nwho were besieging Gaeta in the northern part of the King-\ndom of Naples. His aim was to be safe from French inter-\nference, something he would have managed soon enough no\ndoubt, if his father, Pope Alexander, had not died.\nSo that was how Borgia dealt with the immediate situation.\nAs far as the future was concerned, what worried the duke\nmost of all was that his father’s eventual successor would be\nhostile and try to deprive him of the territory Pope Alexander\nhad given him. He devised four strategies to guard against\nthis: ﬁrst, eliminate the families of all the local rulers whose\nland he had taken, thus denying a new pope the option of\nrestoring them; second, win the support of all the noble\nfamilies of Rome (as we’ve already seen) so as to put the\nbrakes on any papal initiative; third, get as much control as\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   28 28/05/2015   14:14"

Borgia knew the king had real-\nized he’d made a mistake supporting him earlier on and hence\nwould not put up with further adventures. So he began to\nlook around for new alliances and was less than generous in\nhis support when Louis marched south to ﬁght the Spanish\nwho were besieging Gaeta in the northern part of the King-\ndom of Naples. His aim was to be safe from French inter-\nference, something he would have managed soon enough no\ndoubt, if his father, Pope Alexander, had not died.\nSo that was how Borgia dealt with the immediate situation.\nAs far as the future was concerned, what worried the duke\nmost of all was that his father’s eventual successor would be\nhostile and try to deprive him of the territory Pope Alexander\nhad given him. He devised four strategies to guard against\nthis: ﬁrst, eliminate the families of all the local rulers whose\nland he had taken, thus denying a new pope the option of\nrestoring them; second, win the support of all the noble\nfamilies of Rome (as we’ve already seen) so as to put the\nbrakes on any papal initiative; third, get as much control as\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   29 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n3 0 the prince\npossible of the College that would elect the next pope; fourth,\nwin so much territory before the pope died as to be able to\nresist a ﬁrst attack with his own resources. By the time his\nfather died he had achieved three of these four goals and\nwasn’t far off achieving the fourth. He had killed all the local\nrulers he could get his hands on and hardly anyone had\nescaped; he had won over the Roman nobility and he had\nenormous inﬂuence over the Electoral College. As far as\nextending his territory was concerned, he was aiming to be-\ncome master of all Tuscany, having already captured Perugia\nand Piombino and taken Pisa under his protection.\nAs soon as France’s restraining inﬂuence weakened (actu-\nally, it already had, since, having lost the Kingdom of Naples\nto Spain, the French – and the Spanish too for that matter –\nnow needed Borgia’s support) he would grab Pisa. At that\npoint Lucca and Siena would quickly surrender, partly out of\nfear and partly thanks to their old enmity with Florence, after\nwhich the Florentines would be unable to defend themselves.\nIf Borgia had managed all this (and he was almost there the\nvery year Alexander died) he would have accumulated so\nmuch power and prestige that he could have responded to\nany aggression with his own forces and talent and wouldn’t\nhave needed to rely on anyone else’s armies or authority. But\nAlexander died just ﬁve years after his son had ﬁrst drawn his\nsword. Only in Romagna had Borgia consolidated his power;\nall his other territorial gains were still shaky. He was isolated,\ncaught between two extremely powerful, hostile armies, and,\nwhat’s more, mortally ill.\nBorgia was so ruthless and so talented, he knew so well\nthat you have to win over people or destroy them and he had\nbuilt up such solid foundations for his power in such a short\ntime that if he hadn’t had these two armies threatening him,\nor if he hadn’t been so ill, he would have overcome every\nobstacle. That the foundations Borgia had built were sound\nwas soon evident: Romagna waited loyally for more than a\nstates won by lucky circumstance 3 1\nmonth while he lay half dead in Rome, and in Rome itself no\none took advantage of his weakness; when his enemies, the\nBaglionis, Vitellis and Orsinis, turned up no one went over\nto their side. And though Borgia wasn’t able to choose who\nwould be the new pope, at least he was in a position to block\nanyone he didn’t want. So if he had been in good health when\nhis father died, everything would have been easy. He himself\ntold me, in the days when the College was meeting to elect\nJulius II, that he had thought over what might happen on his\nfather’s death and had made plans for every contingency; it\nwas just that it never occurred to him that when the time\ncame he too might be at death’s door.\nHaving given this summary of everything Cesare Borgia\ndid, I can’t ﬁnd anything to criticize; on the contrary, and as\nI said, I mean to propose him as a model for anyone who\ncomes to power through fortunate circumstances or with the\nhelp of another ruler’s armed forces. Given his great determi-\nnation and considerable ambitions, Borgia could hardly have\nbehaved any differently; only the combination of Alexander’s\nearly death and his own illness prevented him from achieving\nhis goals. A new ruler who reckons he must ward off enemies\nand woo friends, overcome obstacles by force or fraud, have\nhimself loved and feared by his people, followed and respected\nby his soldiers, who must eliminate enemies likely or certain\nto attack him, reform old institutions, show himself both\nsevere and gracious, generous and spontaneous, break up a\ndisloyal army and build a new one, keep the friendship of\nkings and princes so that they support him with deference, or\nat least think twice before harming him, will ﬁnd no better\nrecent example to study than the policies of Cesare Borgia.\nThe only criticism one can level at him is his role in the\nelection of Pope Julius. As we’ve said, Borgia wasn’ti na\nposition to impose the pope he wanted but he did have inﬂu-\nence enough to keep out the candidates he didn’t want. And\nhe should never have allowed a cardinal whose interests he\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   30 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n3 0 the prince\npossible of the College that would elect the next pope; fourth,\nwin so much territory before the pope died as to be able to\nresist a ﬁrst attack with his own resources.

I think it’s a question of whether cruelty\nis well or badly used. Cruelty well used (if we can ever speak\nwell of something bad) is short-lived and decisive, no more\nthan is necessary to secure your position and then stop; you\ndon’t go on being cruel but use the power it has given you to\ndeliver maximum beneﬁts to your subjects. Cruelty is badly\nused when you’re not drastic enough at the beginning but\ngrow increasingly cruel later on, rather than easing off. A\nleader who takes the ﬁrst approach has a chance, like Aga-\nthocles, of improving his position with his subjects and with\nGod too; go the other way and you have no chance at all.\nIt’s worth noting that when you take hold of a state, you\nmust assess how much violence and cruelty will be necessary\nand get it over with at once, so as not to have to be cruel on\na regular basis. When you’ve stopped using violence your\nsubjects will be reassured and you can then win them over\nstates won by crime 3 7\nwith generosity. If you don’t do all it takes at the beginning,\nbecause you were badly advised or didn’t have the nerve, then\nyou’ll always have to be wielding the knife; and you’ll never\nbe able to count on your subjects, since with all the violence\nyou’re handing out they won’t be able to count on you. So\nget the violence over with as soon as possible; that way there’ll\nbe less time for people to taste its bitterness and they’ll be less\nhostile. Favours, on the other hand, should be given out\nslowly, one by one, so that they can be properly savoured.\nMost of all, though, a ruler should have the kind of relation-\nship with his subjects where nothing that can happen, good\nor bad, will force him to change his approach, because if hard\ntimes demand it, your cruelty will come too late, while any\nconcessions you make will be seen as wrung out of you and\nno one will be impressed.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   36 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n3 6 the prince\npalace, with the result that people were forced to do what he\nsaid and set up a government with Oliverotto as the ruler.\nHaving killed everyone who opposed the coup and might hit\nback, he strengthened his position by setting up a new army\nand new civil institutions, so that within the year he was not\nonly undisputed master of Fermo but also a serious threat to\nthe neighbouring towns.

We can\ncall this a monarchy with public support and to become its\nking you don’t have to be wholly brilliant or extraordinarily\nlucky, just shrewd in a lucky way. Obviously, to take control\nof this kind of state you need the support of either the common\npeople or the wealthy families, the nobles. In every city one\nﬁnds these two conﬂicting political positions: there are the\ncommon people who are eager not to be ordered around and\noppressed by the noble families, and there are the nobles who\nare eager to oppress the common people and order them\naround. These opposing impulses will lead to one of three\ndifferent situations: a monarchy, a republic, or anarchy.\nA monarchy can be brought about either by the common\npeople or the nobles, when one or the other party ﬁnds it\nconvenient.

We can\ncall this a monarchy with public support and to become its\nking you don’t have to be wholly brilliant or extraordinarily\nlucky, just shrewd in a lucky way. Obviously, to take control\nof this kind of state you need the support of either the common\npeople or the wealthy families, the nobles. In every city one\nﬁnds these two conﬂicting political positions: there are the\ncommon people who are eager not to be ordered around and\noppressed by the noble families, and there are the nobles who\nare eager to oppress the common people and order them\naround. These opposing impulses will lead to one of three\ndifferent situations: a monarchy, a republic, or anarchy.\nA monarchy can be brought about either by the common\npeople or the nobles, when one or the other party ﬁnds it\nconvenient. Seeing that they can’t control the people, the\nwealthy families begin to concentrate prestige on one of their\nnumber and make him king so as to be able to get what they\nwant in his shadow. Likewise, the people, seeing that they\ncan’t resist the power of the nobles, concentrate prestige on\none citizen and make him king so that his authority will\nprotect them.

The pope and the Venetians were the most\neager expansionists. The only way to hold back the Venetians\nwas for all the other states to band together, as they did in\nthe defence of Ferrara; to frustrate the pope, on the other\nhand, they relied on the Roman barons. Since these barons\nwere divided into two factions, the Orsinis and the Colonnas,\nthey always had something to ﬁght about, and with their\nswords drawn under the pope’s nose they kept him weak and\nindecisive.

Using Valentino Borgia and taking advantage of the\nintrusions of the French, he made all the gains I mentioned in\nmy discussion of Duke Valentino. And though Alexander’s\naim was to make his son great, not the Church, all the same\nhis achievements enhanced the power of the Church, which,\nafter his and then Valentino’s death, inherited his conquests.\nSo on his election Pope Julius took over a Church that now\npossessed the whole of Romagna and was all the more power-\nful because Alexander had quashed the Roman barons and\nchurch states 4 7\ntheir factions. He also found a new way of increasing Church\nincome which had never been used before.*\nJulius not only followed Alexander’s lead, but went further.\nHe aimed to take Bologna, defeat the Venetians and push the\nFrench out of Italy. In the end all three goals were achieved\nand Julius’s credit was the greater because he did it for the\nglory of the Church, not out of private interest. He kept the\nOrsini and Colonna factions in the same reduced state he\nfound them in, and, though one or two of their leaders tried\nto change things, two obstacles held them back: the ﬁrst was\nthe Church’s power, which unnerved them, and the second\nwas the fact that they had no cardinals. Cardinals are always a\ncause of internal division; when they have their own cardinals,\nthese factions are never quiet, because the cardinals feed party\nanimosity both inside and outside Rome and the barons are\nforced to come to their party’s defence. So it’s the ambition\nof the cardinals that prompts hostility and conﬂict between\nthe barons. On Julius’s death, his Holiness Pope Leo found\nthe papacy in an extremely strong position and it is to be\nhoped that while his predecessors made the Church great by\narmed force, he can make it even greater and more praise-\nworthy thanks to his goodness and many, many other virtues.\n* The sale of Church beneﬁces and indulgences.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   46 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n4 6 the prince\nBefore Charles, King of France, came down into Italy, the\ncountry was controlled by the pope, the Venetians, the King\nof Naples, the Duke of Milan and the Florentines.

Using Valentino Borgia and taking advantage of the\nintrusions of the French, he made all the gains I mentioned in\nmy discussion of Duke Valentino. And though Alexander’s\naim was to make his son great, not the Church, all the same\nhis achievements enhanced the power of the Church, which,\nafter his and then Valentino’s death, inherited his conquests.\nSo on his election Pope Julius took over a Church that now\npossessed the whole of Romagna and was all the more power-\nful because Alexander had quashed the Roman barons and\nchurch states 4 7\ntheir factions. He also found a new way of increasing Church\nincome which had never been used before.*\nJulius not only followed Alexander’s lead, but went further.\nHe aimed to take Bologna, defeat the Venetians and push the\nFrench out of Italy. In the end all three goals were achieved\nand Julius’s credit was the greater because he did it for the\nglory of the Church, not out of private interest. He kept the\nOrsini and Colonna factions in the same reduced state he\nfound them in, and, though one or two of their leaders tried\nto change things, two obstacles held them back: the ﬁrst was\nthe Church’s power, which unnerved them, and the second\nwas the fact that they had no cardinals. Cardinals are always a\ncause of internal division; when they have their own cardinals,\nthese factions are never quiet, because the cardinals feed party\nanimosity both inside and outside Rome and the barons are\nforced to come to their party’s defence. So it’s the ambition\nof the cardinals that prompts hostility and conﬂict between\nthe barons. On Julius’s death, his Holiness Pope Leo found\nthe papacy in an extremely strong position and it is to be\nhoped that while his predecessors made the Church great by\narmed force, he can make it even greater and more praise-\nworthy thanks to his goodness and many, many other virtues.\n* The sale of Church beneﬁces and indulgences.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   47 28/05/2015   14:14"

Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless\nand dangerous. If you are counting on mercenaries to defend\nyour state you will never be stable or secure, because mercen-\naries are ambitious, undisciplined, disloyal and they quarrel\namong themselves. Courageous with friends and cowardly\nwith enemies, they have no fear of God and keep no promises.\nWith mercenaries the only way to delay disaster is to delay\nthe battle; in peacetime they plunder you and in wartime they\nlet the enemy plunder you.

Things reached the point where an\narmy of 20,000 would have fewer than 2,000 infantry.

With auxiliaries your ruin is guaranteed: they\nare a tightly knit force and every one of them obedient to\nsomeone else; when mercenaries win they need time and a\nconvenient opportunity before they can attack you, if only\nbecause they’re not a solid united force, you chose them,\nyou’re paying them, and hence it will take the man you put\nin command a while to build up sufﬁcient authority to turn\nagainst you. To summarize, the big danger with mercenaries\nis their indecision, with auxiliaries their determination.\nSo, sensible rulers have always avoided using auxiliaries\nand mercenaries, relying instead on their own men and even\npreferring to lose with their own troops than to win with\nothers, on the principle that a victory won with foreign forces\nis not a real victory at all. As always Cesare Borgia offers a\ngood example. He invaded Romagna with an army entirely\nmade up of French auxiliaries and took Imola and Forlı ` with\nthem; but since he felt they weren’t reliable he turned to\nmercenaries as a less dangerous option. He hired the Orsini\nand Vitelli armies, but when he found that they dithered in\nbattle and were disloyal and dangerous, he had them killed\nand trained his own men. It’s easy to see the difference\nbetween these various kinds of armies if you look at the duke’s\nstanding when he had just the French, when he had the Orsinis\nand the Vitellis, and when he had his own soldiers and relied\non his own resources. With each change his prestige grew and\nhe was only truly respected when everyone could see that his\ntroops were entirely his own.\nI had planned to stick to these recent Italian examples, but\nI wouldn’t like to leave out Hiero of Syracuse since he is\none of the men I talked about before. Given command, as I\nauxiliaries, combined forces and citizen armies 55\nexplained, of the Syracusan armies, Hiero soon realized that\nthe mercenaries among them were no good, led as they were\nby men like our Italian commanders. Realizing that he could\nneither make use of them nor let them go, he had them all cut\nto pieces, and from then on fought only with his own soldiers.\nI’d also like to bring in a parable from the Old Testament.\nWhen David offered to go and ﬁght the Philistine trouble-\nmaker, Goliath, on Saul’s behalf, Saul gave him his own\nweapons to bolster the boy’s courage. But no sooner had\nDavid put them on than he refused the gift, saying he wouldn’t\nfeel conﬁdent with them, he would rather face the enemy with\nhis own sling and knife. In the end, other people’s arms are\neither too loose, too heavy or too tight.\nWhen, with luck and good leadership, Charles VII,\nLouis XI’s father, had pushed the English out of France, he\nsaw that a ruler needs his own troops and so set up a standing\narmy of both cavalry and infantry. Later, his son Louis dis-\nbanded the infantry and began to hire Swiss mercenaries.\nIt’s now plain that this mistake, together with others that\nfollowed, is what lies behind France’s present troubles. By\ngiving this important role to the Swiss, Louis had weakened\nhis whole army, since, with no infantry of their own, his\ncavalry were now relying on others, and once they’d got\nused to ﬁghting alongside the Swiss they started to think\nthey couldn’t win without them. As a result the French are\nunable to take on the Swiss in battle and won’t ﬁght anyone\nelse without their help. So French forces are now mixed,\npart mercenary and part their own men. Such composite\nforces are much better than just auxiliaries or just mercen-\naries, but much worse than having all your own men. France’s\nsituation proves the point, because if the standing army\nCharles recruited had been reinforced or just maintained, the\nFrench would be unbeatable. But men are so thoughtless\nthey’ll opt for a diet that tastes good without realizing there’s\na hidden poison in it: it’s like the problem I mentioned earlier\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   54 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n5 4 the prince\nConstantinople brought 10,000 Turks into Greece and when\nthe war was over they wouldn’t leave, which was how the\ninﬁdels began to get control of Greece.\nSo anyone looking for a no-win situation should turn to\nauxiliaries, because they are far more dangerous even than\nmercenaries. With auxiliaries your ruin is guaranteed: they\nare a tightly knit force and every one of them obedient to\nsomeone else; when mercenaries win they need time and a\nconvenient opportunity before they can attack you, if only\nbecause they’re not a solid united force, you chose them,\nyou’re paying them, and hence it will take the man you put\nin command a while to build up sufﬁcient authority to turn\nagainst you. To summarize, the big danger with mercenaries\nis their indecision, with auxiliaries their determination.\nSo, sensible rulers have always avoided using auxiliaries\nand mercenaries, relying instead on their own men and even\npreferring to lose with their own troops than to win with\nothers, on the principle that a victory won with foreign forces\nis not a real victory at all. As always Cesare Borgia offers a\ngood example. He invaded Romagna with an army entirely\nmade up of French auxiliaries and took Imola and Forlı ` with\nthem; but since he felt they weren’t reliable he turned to\nmercenaries as a less dangerous option. He hired the Orsini\nand Vitelli armies, but when he found that they dithered in\nbattle and were disloyal and dangerous, he had them killed\nand trained his own men. It’s easy to see the difference\nbetween these various kinds of armies if you look at the duke’s\nstanding when he had just the French, when he had the Orsinis\nand the Vitellis, and when he had his own soldiers and relied\non his own resources. With each change his prestige grew and\nhe was only truly respected when everyone could see that his\ntroops were entirely his own.\nI had planned to stick to these recent Italian examples, but\nI wouldn’t like to leave out Hiero of Syracuse since he is\none of the men I talked about before. Given command, as I\nauxiliaries, combined forces and citizen armies 55\nexplained, of the Syracusan armies, Hiero soon realized that\nthe mercenaries among them were no good, led as they were\nby men like our Italian commanders. Realizing that he could\nneither make use of them nor let them go, he had them all cut\nto pieces, and from then on fought only with his own soldiers.\nI’d also like to bring in a parable from the Old Testament.\nWhen David offered to go and ﬁght the Philistine trouble-\nmaker, Goliath, on Saul’s behalf, Saul gave him his own\nweapons to bolster the boy’s courage. But no sooner had\nDavid put them on than he refused the gift, saying he wouldn’t\nfeel conﬁdent with them, he would rather face the enemy with\nhis own sling and knife. In the end, other people’s arms are\neither too loose, too heavy or too tight.\nWhen, with luck and good leadership, Charles VII,\nLouis XI’s father, had pushed the English out of France, he\nsaw that a ruler needs his own troops and so set up a standing\narmy of both cavalry and infantry. Later, his son Louis dis-\nbanded the infantry and began to hire Swiss mercenaries.\nIt’s now plain that this mistake, together with others that\nfollowed, is what lies behind France’s present troubles. By\ngiving this important role to the Swiss, Louis had weakened\nhis whole army, since, with no infantry of their own, his\ncavalry were now relying on others, and once they’d got\nused to ﬁghting alongside the Swiss they started to think\nthey couldn’t win without them. As a result the French are\nunable to take on the Swiss in battle and won’t ﬁght anyone\nelse without their help. So French forces are now mixed,\npart mercenary and part their own men. Such composite\nforces are much better than just auxiliaries or just mercen-\naries, but much worse than having all your own men. France’s\nsituation proves the point, because if the standing army\nCharles recruited had been reinforced or just maintained, the\nFrench would be unbeatable. But men are so thoughtless\nthey’ll opt for a diet that tastes good without realizing there’s\na hidden poison in it: it’s like the problem I mentioned earlier\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   55 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n5 6 the prince\nabout people not diagnosing tuberculosis until it’s too late.\nSo, if a man can’t spot a problem in the making, he can’t\nreally be a wise leader. But very few men have this gift. If you\nlook for the initial cause of the collapse of the Roman empire,\nyou’ll ﬁnd it was when they started hiring Goths as mercen-\naries. From that moment on the strength of the empire began\nto decline and all the determination that drained out of it\nwent to strengthen its rivals.\nSo, to conclude: no state is secure without its own army; if\nit hasn’t got men to defend it determinedly and loyally in a\ncrisis, it is simply relying on luck. As those who understand\nthese things have always thought and said: There is nothing\nso weak and unstable as a reputation for power that is not\nbacked up by its own army.* And having your own army\nmeans having a force made up of subjects, or citizens, or\nmen dependent on you. All other forces are mercenaries or\nauxiliaries. To see how to set up your own armed forces, all\nyou need do is consider how the four men I mentioned above\norganized and arranged theirs, or Philip, Alexander the\nGreat’s father, or many other kingdoms and republics. They\nare all entirely reliable models.\n* Quod nihil sit tam inﬁrmum aut instabile quam fama potentiae non sua\nvi nixa.\n14\nA ruler and his army\nA ruler, then, must have no other aim or consideration, nor\nseek to develop any other vocation outside war, the organiz-\nation of the army and military discipline. This is the only\nproper vocation of the man in command. And it’s such a\npotent one that it not only keeps those born to rule on their\nthrones but often raises private citizens to political power.\nVice versa, when rulers think more about frills than ﬁght-\ning they lose their thrones. In fact, the thing most likely to\nbring about a ruler’s downfall is his neglect of the art of\nwar; the thing most likely to win him power is becoming an\nexpert in it.\nA military man with his own army, Francesco Sforza rose\nfrom commoner to Duke of Milan; shunning military hard-\nships, his sons fell from dukes to commoners. For one of the\nmany negative consequences of not having an army is that\npeople will ﬁnd you pathetic, and this is a stigma a ruler must\nguard against, as I’ll explain. The fact is that between a man\nwho has an army and a man who hasn’t there is simply no\ncomparison. And there is no reason why a man who com-\nmands an armed force should willingly obey a man who\ndoesn’t, or why a man who doesn’t command an army should\nlive safely beside a servant who does. The one will harbour\ncontempt and the other suspicion and they won’t be able to\nwork well together. So, quite apart from the other disadvan-\ntages, a ruler who doesn’t involve himself in military matters\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   56 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n5 6 the prince\nabout people not diagnosing tuberculosis until it’s too late.\nSo, if a man can’t spot a problem in the making, he can’t\nreally be a wise leader.

Alexander\nthe Great, it seems, modelled himself on Achilles, Caesar on\nAlexander and Scipio on Cyrus. Anyone who reads Xeno-\nphon’s life of Cyrus will see how valuable his example was to\nScipio, and how closely Scipio’s decency, charm, humanity\nand generosity conform to the description Xenophon gives of\nCyrus.

All the same,\nbeing generous just to be seen to be so will damage you.\nGenerosity practised out of real good will, as it should be,\nrisks passing unnoticed and you won’t escape a reputation\nfor meanness. Hence, if you’re determined to have people\nthink of you as generous, you’ll have to be lavish in every\npossible way; naturally, a ruler who follows this policy will\nsoon use up all his wealth to the point that, if he wants to\nkeep up his reputation, he’ll have to impose special taxes and\ndo everything a ruler can to raise cash. His people will start\nto hate him and no one will respect him now he has no money.\nSince his generosity will have damaged the majority and bene-\nﬁted only a few, he’ll be vulnerable to the ﬁrst bad news, and\nthe ﬁrst real danger may well topple him. When he realizes\nthis and tries to change his ways, he’ll immediately be accused\nof meanness.\nSince a ruler can’t be generous and show it without putting\nhimself at risk, if he’s sensible he won’t mind getting a repu-\ntation for meanness. With time, when people see that his\npenny-pinching means he doesn’t need to raise taxes and can\ndefend the country against attack and embark on campaigns\nwithout putting a burden on his people, he’ll increasingly be\nseen as generous – generous to those he takes nothing from,\nwhich is to say almost everybody, and mean to those who get\ngenerosity and meanness 6 3\nnothing from him, which is to say very few. In our own\ntimes the only leaders we’ve seen doing great things were\nall reckoned mean. The others were failures. Pope Julius II\nexploited his reputation for generosity to get the papacy, then\ngladly let it go to ﬁnance his wars. The present King of France\nhas fought many wars without resorting to new taxes, some-\nthing he can do because his constant cost-cutting has provided\nfor the extra expenditure. The present King of Spain would\nnot have won all the wars he has if he had had a reputation\nfor generosity.\nSo, if as a result he has the resources to defend his country,\nisn’t obliged to steal from his subjects or prey on others, and\nis in no danger of falling into poverty, a ruler need hardly\nworry about a reputation for meanness; it is one of the nega-\ntive qualities that keep him in power. And if someone protests:\nBut it was generosity that won Caesar the empire and many\nothers have risen to the highest positions because they were\nand were seen to be generous, my response is: A ruler in\npower and a man seeking power are two different things. For\nthe ruler already in power generosity is dangerous; for the\nman seeking power it is essential. Caesar was one of a number\nof men who wanted to become emperor of Rome; but if he’d\nsurvived as emperor and gone on spending in the same way,\nhe would have destroyed the empire. And if someone were to\nobject: Many rulers who scored great military victories were\nconsidered extremely generous, I’d reply: Either a ruler is\nspending his own and his subjects’ money, or someone else’s.\nWhen the money is his own or his subjects’, he should go easy;\nwhen it’s someone else’s, he should be as lavish as he can.\nA ruler leading his armies and living on plunder, pillage\nand extortion is using other people’s money and had better\nbe generous with it, otherwise his soldiers won’t follow him.\nWhat’s not your own or your subjects’ can be given away\nfreely: Cyrus did this; so did Caesar and Alexander.

It’s only spending your own money that puts you at risk.\nNothing consumes itself so much as generosity, because while\nyou practise it you’re losing the wherewithal to go on practis-\ning it.

If all men were good,\nthis would be bad advice, but since they are a sad lot and\nwon’t be keeping their promises to you, you hardly need to\nkeep yours to them. Anyway, a ruler will never be short of\ngood reasons to explain away a broken promise. It would be\neasy to cite any number of examples from modern times to\nshow just how many peace treaties and other commitments\nhave been rendered null and void by rulers not keeping their\nword. Those best at playing the fox have done better than the\nothers. But you have to know how to disguise your slyness,\nhow to pretend one thing and cover up another.

I’ll go so far as to say this: if he had those\nqualities and observed them all the time, he’d be putting\nhimself at risk.

And you can even be those things, so long as\nyou’re always mentally prepared to change as soon as your\ninterests are threatened. What you have to understand is that\na ruler, especially a ruler new to power, can’t always behave\nin ways that would make people think a man good, because\nto stay in power he’s frequently obliged to act against loyalty,\nagainst charity, against humanity and against religion. What\na ruler and his promises 7 1\nmatters is that he has the sort of character that can change\ntack as luck and circumstances demand, and, as I’ve already\nsaid, stick to the good if he can but know how to be bad\nwhen the occasion demands.\nSo a ruler must be extremely careful not to say anything\nthat doesn’t appear to be inspired by the ﬁve virtues listed\nabove; he must seem and sound wholly compassionate,\nwholly loyal, wholly humane, wholly honest and wholly\nreligious.

As I’ve already said, what most leads\nto a ruler being hated is seizing and stealing his subjects’\nproperty and women; that he must not do. As long as you\ndon’t deprive them of property or honour most men will be\nhappy enough and you’ll only have to watch out for the\nambitious few who can easily be reined back in various ways.\nYou’ll be held in contempt, on the other hand, if you’re seen\nas changeable, superﬁcial, effeminate, fearful or indecisive.\nSo a ruler must avoid those qualities like so many stumbling\nblocks and act in such a way that everything he does gives an\nimpression of greatness, spirit, seriousness and strength; when\npresiding over disputes between citizens he should insist that\nhis decision is ﬁnal and make sure no one imagines they can\ntrick or outwit him.\nThe ruler who projects this impression of himself will be\nhighly thought of and it’s hard to conspire against a man who\nis well thought of. Then so long as he has a reputation for\nexcellence and is respected by his people it will be hard for\noutside enemies to attack him either. A ruler must guard\navoiding contempt and hatred 7 3\nagainst two kinds of danger: one internal, coming from his\nown people; the other external, coming from foreign powers.\nTo defend yourself against foreign powers you need a good\narmy and good allies. And if you have a good army you’ll\nalways have good allies, and when you’re secure against\nforeign powers you’ll always be secure internally too, assum-\ning there wasn’t already a conspiracy under way. Then even\nwhen a foreign power does move against you, if you’ve lived\nand organized yourself as I’ve suggested, you only have to\nkeep your nerve and you’ll survive any and every attack, like\nthe Spartan ruler Nabis in the example I gave earlier.\nTo get back to the internal situation: when there is no threat\nfrom outside, a ruler must take care that his subjects don’t\nstart conspiring against him. He can guard against this by\nmaking sure he isn’t hated or despised and that people are\nhappy with him, all of which is very important, as I’ve\nexplained at length. In fact, one of the most powerful prevent-\nive measures against conspiracies is simply not being hated\nby a majority of the people. People planning a conspiracy\nmust believe that killing the ruler will be popular; when they\nrealize that, on the contrary, it would be unpopular they\nlose heart, because conspiracies are always beset with endless\ndifﬁculties. Experience shows that for every successful con-\nspiracy there are any number of failures. A conspirator can’t\nact alone and can look for accomplices only among people he\nbelieves are unhappy with the situation. But as soon as he\nreveals his intentions to someone else he’s giving that person\nthe chance to improve his position, since obviously there are\nall kinds of advantages to be had from betraying a conspiracy.\nWhen you reckon that the beneﬁts of betrayal are assured,\nwhile joining a conspiracy is a risky and extremely dangerous\nbusiness, the man will have to be a rare friend indeed, or a\nvery bitter enemy of the government, if he’s going to keep\nfaith.\nTo summarize: on the conspirator’s side all you have is\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   72 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n19\nAvoiding contempt and hatred\nNow that I’ve discussed the most important of the qualities I\nlisted I’d like to look at the others more brieﬂy in relation to\nthe principle, already mentioned, that a ruler must avoid any\nbehaviour that will lead to his being hated or held in con-\ntempt; every time he manages this he’s done what a ruler\nshould and can indulge other bad habits without worrying\nabout the consequences.

He can guard against this by\nmaking sure he isn’t hated or despised and that people are\nhappy with him, all of which is very important, as I’ve\nexplained at length. In fact, one of the most powerful prevent-\nive measures against conspiracies is simply not being hated\nby a majority of the people. People planning a conspiracy\nmust believe that killing the ruler will be popular; when they\nrealize that, on the contrary, it would be unpopular they\nlose heart, because conspiracies are always beset with endless\ndifﬁculties. Experience shows that for every successful con-\nspiracy there are any number of failures. A conspirator can’t\nact alone and can look for accomplices only among people he\nbelieves are unhappy with the situation. But as soon as he\nreveals his intentions to someone else he’s giving that person\nthe chance to improve his position, since obviously there are\nall kinds of advantages to be had from betraying a conspiracy.\nWhen you reckon that the beneﬁts of betrayal are assured,\nwhile joining a conspiracy is a risky and extremely dangerous\nbusiness, the man will have to be a rare friend indeed, or a\nvery bitter enemy of the government, if he’s going to keep\nfaith.\nTo summarize: on the conspirator’s side all you have is\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   73 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n7 4 the prince\nfear, envy and the demoralizing prospect of punishment, while\nthe ruler on his side has the authority of the government and\nits laws plus the protection of his friends and the state. Add\nto all that the good will of the people and it’s extremely\nunlikely that anyone will be so crazy as to start a conspiracy.\nBecause, while in general a conspirator has most to fear prior\nto the coup, in this case, with the people against him, he’s\ngoing to be in danger afterwards too and the fact that he’s seen\noff the ruler doesn’t mean he can expect to escape unscathed.\nI could give inﬁnite examples of this but let’s make do\nwith just one that happened in our fathers’ times. Annibale\nBentivogli, grandfather of the present Annibale, was Duke of\nBologna when the Canneschis conspired against him and\nkilled him. At that point the only surviving Bentivogli was his\nson, Giovanni, who was still a baby. All the same, immediately\nafter the murder, the people rose up and killed all the Can-\nneschis. This was because the Bentivogli family was extremely\npopular at the time. In fact, when the Bolognese realized that\nwith Annibale dead there were no family members capable of\nruling the town, they went to Florence to get a man who was\nsupposedly a Bentivogli, though until shortly before that he\nhad passed himself off as the son of a blacksmith; they asked\nhim to govern Bologna and he duly did so until Giovanni was\nold enough to take over.\nMy conclusion, then, is that so long as he has the people\non his side a ruler needn’t worry about conspiracies, but\nwhen they are against him and hate him he’ll have to watch\neveryone’s every move. Sensible rulers and well-run states\nhave always done all they can not to drive the nobles to\ndespair and to keep the people happy and satisﬁed; indeed\nthis is one of a ruler’s most important tasks.\nOne of the better organized and well-governed states in our\nown times is France. It is full of good institutions which\nguarantee the king’s security and freedom of action. The most\nimportant of these is parliament and parliamentary authority.\navoiding contempt and hatred 7 5\nIn fact the king who set up the country’s constitution was\naware of the ambition and presumption of the nobles and\nreckoned they needed a bit in their mouths to rein them back.\nHe also knew how much the people hated and feared the\nnobles and he wanted to protect them. But it was important\nthat the king shouldn’t be personally responsible for doing\nthis since then he might be blamed by the nobles for favouring\nthe people or by the people for favouring the nobles. So he\nintroduced an independent body, parliament, that could keep\nthe nobles in their place and protect the people without the\nking’s being responsible. There really couldn’t be a better or\nmore sensible institution, nor one more conducive to the\nsecurity of the king and the realm. This prompts the following\nreﬂection: that a ruler must get others to carry out policies\nthat will provoke protest, keeping those that inspire gratitude\nto himself. In conclusion, let me repeat that a ruler should\nrespect the nobles but must make sure he is not hated by the\npeople.\nPerhaps many readers familiar with the fate of certain\nRoman emperors will feel that their examples contradict these\nopinions of mine, in that they consistently behaved well and\nshowed great character but nevertheless lost their empire or\neven their lives at the hands of subjects who conspired against\nthem.

But he didn’t last long. Two things\nled to his being both hated and despised. First, his extremely\nlowly background: he had been a shepherd in Thrace – every-\nbody knew it and thought it scandalous; second, on becoming\nemperor he had put off going to Rome for the formal investi-\nture and got himself a reputation for extreme cruelty by\nordering his prefects in Rome and all over the empire to\ncarry out numerous atrocities. Universally despised for his\nlow birth, hated and feared for his ferocity, he faced rebellions\nﬁrst in Africa, then in the Senate; the Senate rebellion was\nsupported by the entire population of Rome. Then the whole\nof Italy conspired against him, until ﬁnally his own army got\ninvolved; they were laying siege to Aquileia and ﬁnding it\ntough going; they were also fed up with his cruelty and when\nthey realized how many enemies he had they became less\nafraid of the man and killed him.\nI don’t want to talk about Heliogabalus, Macrinus or\nJulian, who were all intensely despised and swiftly dispatched.\nInstead I’ll conclude this discussion with the reﬂection that\ncontemporary rulers do not have to give the same priority to\nsatisfying the army that the Roman emperors did. True, one\ndoes have to pay the army some attention, but the problem is\nsoon resolved, because none of today’s rulers has to live\nwith armies that have long experience in the government and\nadministration of the provinces, as the armies of the Roman\nempire did. If the emperors had to put their armies before the\npeople it was because the armies were the more powerful.\nThese days it is more important for all rulers, with the excep-\ntions of the Turkish and Egyptian sultans, to put the people\nbefore the army, because the people are more powerful.\nI’ve made an exception of the Turkish leader because he\nkeeps an army of 12,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry beside\nhim. Depending on them as he does for the strength and\nsecurity of his realm he has to put their good will before any\nother consideration. In the same way, Egypt is entirely at the\navoiding contempt and hatred 8 1\nmercy of its army and again the sultan has to satisfy the\nsoldiers before worrying about the people. It’s worth noting\nthat Egypt is a unique case; it is similar to the papal state,\nwhich can’t be classiﬁed as a hereditary monarchy or as a\nnew monarchy. When the old ruler dies he is not replaced by\none of his children, but a new leader is elected by a body\nvested with this authority. Since the state’s institutions are\nwell established, this can hardly be compared with a situation\nwhere a new ruler seizes a state, and in fact a pope or Egyptian\nsultan faces none of the difﬁculties that a new ruler usually\nfaces, because although he may be new to power the insti-\ntutions are old and set up to work on his behalf as if he were\na hereditary king.\nBut let’s get back to our discussion. I’m sure that anyone\nreﬂecting on what I’ve said will see that it was hatred or\ncontempt that led to the downfall of these Roman emperors;\nthey will also understand how it was that, while some behaved\none way and some another, there were nevertheless successes\nand failures in both groups. Since they had seized rather than\ninherited power, it was futile and dangerous for Pertinax\nand Alexander to try to imitate Marcus Aurelius, who had\ninherited his position; similarly, since they didn’t have the\nnecessary qualities, it was a fatal mistake for Caracalla, Com-\nmodus and Maximinus to imitate Severus. Though a man\nwho has seized power and is establishing a new monarchy\ncannot imitate the likes of Marcus Aurelius, that doesn’t mean\nhe has to behave like Severus. What he must take from Severus\nare the policies you need to found a state, and from Marcus\nthe policies that bring stability and glory once the state is\nﬁrmly established.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   80 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n8 0 the prince\nMaximinus in his place.

Universally despised for his\nlow birth, hated and feared for his ferocity, he faced rebellions\nﬁrst in Africa, then in the Senate; the Senate rebellion was\nsupported by the entire population of Rome. Then the whole\nof Italy conspired against him, until ﬁnally his own army got\ninvolved; they were laying siege to Aquileia and ﬁnding it\ntough going; they were also fed up with his cruelty and when\nthey realized how many enemies he had they became less\nafraid of the man and killed him.\nI don’t want to talk about Heliogabalus, Macrinus or\nJulian, who were all intensely despised and swiftly dispatched.\nInstead I’ll conclude this discussion with the reﬂection that\ncontemporary rulers do not have to give the same priority to\nsatisfying the army that the Roman emperors did. True, one\ndoes have to pay the army some attention, but the problem is\nsoon resolved, because none of today’s rulers has to live\nwith armies that have long experience in the government and\nadministration of the provinces, as the armies of the Roman\nempire did. If the emperors had to put their armies before the\npeople it was because the armies were the more powerful.\nThese days it is more important for all rulers, with the excep-\ntions of the Turkish and Egyptian sultans, to put the people\nbefore the army, because the people are more powerful.\nI’ve made an exception of the Turkish leader because he\nkeeps an army of 12,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry beside\nhim. Depending on them as he does for the strength and\nsecurity of his realm he has to put their good will before any\nother consideration. In the same way, Egypt is entirely at the\navoiding contempt and hatred 8 1\nmercy of its army and again the sultan has to satisfy the\nsoldiers before worrying about the people. It’s worth noting\nthat Egypt is a unique case; it is similar to the papal state,\nwhich can’t be classiﬁed as a hereditary monarchy or as a\nnew monarchy. When the old ruler dies he is not replaced by\none of his children, but a new leader is elected by a body\nvested with this authority. Since the state’s institutions are\nwell established, this can hardly be compared with a situation\nwhere a new ruler seizes a state, and in fact a pope or Egyptian\nsultan faces none of the difﬁculties that a new ruler usually\nfaces, because although he may be new to power the insti-\ntutions are old and set up to work on his behalf as if he were\na hereditary king.\nBut let’s get back to our discussion. I’m sure that anyone\nreﬂecting on what I’ve said will see that it was hatred or\ncontempt that led to the downfall of these Roman emperors;\nthey will also understand how it was that, while some behaved\none way and some another, there were nevertheless successes\nand failures in both groups. Since they had seized rather than\ninherited power, it was futile and dangerous for Pertinax\nand Alexander to try to imitate Marcus Aurelius, who had\ninherited his position; similarly, since they didn’t have the\nnecessary qualities, it was a fatal mistake for Caracalla, Com-\nmodus and Maximinus to imitate Severus. Though a man\nwho has seized power and is establishing a new monarchy\ncannot imitate the likes of Marcus Aurelius, that doesn’t mean\nhe has to behave like Severus. What he must take from Severus\nare the policies you need to found a state, and from Marcus\nthe policies that bring stability and glory once the state is\nﬁrmly established.\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   81 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n20\nWhether fortresses and other strategies\nrulers frequently adopt are useful\nTo hold power more securely, some rulers have disarmed\ntheir citizens; some have kept subject towns divided in fac-\ntions; some have encouraged hostility towards themselves;\nothers have sought to win over those who were initially sus-\npicious of their rise to power; some have built fortresses;\nothers have torn them down and destroyed them. And though\none can’t pass ﬁnal judgement on these policies without\ndetailed knowledge of the states where such decisions were\ntaken, all the same I shall try to discuss the matter in general\nterms as far as is possible.\nNo one new to power has ever disarmed his subjects; on\nthe contrary, ﬁnding them disarmed new rulers have always\narmed them. When you’re the one giving people arms, those\narms become yours; men who were potentially hostile become\nloyal, while those already loyal become your supporters rather\nthan just your subjects. It’s true you can’t arm everyone, but\nin favouring some you can feel safer about the others too.\nSeeing that they’ve been preferred, the men you’ve armed will\nbe under an obligation to you. The others won’t be resentful,\nunderstanding that the people facing danger for you and\nbinding their lives to yours will inevitably deserve the greater\nrewards. But when you take arms away from people, then\nyou start to upset them; you show you don’t trust them\nbecause you’re frightened or cagey. Either way, they’ll begin\nto hate you. Then, since you can hardly manage without an\nwhether fortresses and other strategies are useful 83\narmy, you’ll have to turn to mercenary forces, which will\nhave all the failings I discussed earlier. And even if your\nmercenaries are good, they’ll never be good enough to defend\nyou against powerful enemies and a hostile people.\nSo, as I said, a new ruler in a newly constituted state has\nalways armed his subjects. History offers endless examples.\nBut when a ruler acquires a new territory to add like an extra\nlimb to an existing state, then he must disarm its people,\nexcept for the men who supported him when he took it. But\nwith time and opportunity even those men should be kept\nweak and emasculated so that all the real armed force in the\nstate as a whole resides with your own soldiers who live with\nyou in your home base.\nGenerations ago, the experts in Florence used to say that\nyou had to hold Pistoia by playing on its factions and Pisa by\nholding its fortresses. So they encouraged factionalism in\nsome of the towns they held, the better to control them. In\ntimes when there was a certain balance between opposing\nparties in Italy this was probably an effective policy, but I\ndon’t think we should take it as a rule today. I don’t think\nfactional divisions ever really improved the situation. On the\ncontrary, when an enemy approaches, a subject town that’s\ndivided in factions will fall at once. The weaker of the factions\nwill always join forces with the attacker and the other faction\nwon’t be strong enough to beat them both.\nThe Venetians were reasoning along the same lines, I\nbelieve, when they fomented divisions between Guelphs and\nGhibellines in the towns they held; they didn’t let the factions\nget as far as bloodshed but encouraged divergences so that\npeople would be too busy with their own disputes to unite\nagainst Venice. It wasn’t, as things turned out, a successful\npolicy. After the Venetians’ defeat at Vaila` , one or other of\nthe factions immediately took courage and seized control\nof the various towns.

In times of war everyone can see how ﬂawed the\npolicy is.\nThere’s no doubt that rulers achieve greatness by over-\ncoming the obstacles and enemies they ﬁnd in their path. So\nwhen destiny wants to make a ruler great, particularly a new\nruler who, unlike a hereditary king, really needs to build up\nhis reputation, it sends him enemies and prompts them to\nattack him.

Pandolfo Petrucci ran Siena more with the\nmen he had doubted than the others. But it’s hard to lay down\nﬁrm rules here because things vary from case to case. I’ll just\nsay this: that a ruler can very easily win over men who\nopposed him when he came to power, if they are not in a\nposition to support themselves with their own resources.\nThey’ll be forced to behave more loyally than others in that\nthey know they have to work hard to offset the negative\nimpression the ruler initially had of them. So a ruler can\nalways get more out of such men than out of people who feel\ntoo safe in his service and don’t really make an effort.\nSince the discussion demands it, I wouldn’t like to leave\nout a reminder to any ruler who has taken a new state with\ninside help that he must think hard about why the local people\nwho helped him did so. If they didn’t act out of natural\nfriendship for the new ruler, but only because the previous\ngovernment wasn’t giving them what they wanted, it will\nbe extremely demanding and difﬁcult to keep their support,\nbecause the new ruler won’t be able to give them what they\nwhether fortresses and other strategies are useful 85\nwant either. Looking carefully at the reasons for this and\ndrawing on the examples available from ancient and modern\nhistory, we ﬁnd that it is much easier to win over those who\nwere content with the previous government, and hence your\nenemies, than the men who were not content and so made an\nalliance with you and helped you take the country.\nOne way rulers have tried to secure their power is by build-\ning fortresses to curb and discourage potential aggressors and\nto offer a safe refuge in case of sudden attack. I approve of\nthis policy, if only because it has been used for centuries. All\nthe same, there is the recent example of Niccolo ` Vitelli who\ndemolished two fortresses in Citta` di Castello in order to hold\nthe town. When Guidobaldo retook possession of his lands\nafter Cesare Borgia’s occupation, he razed every fortress in\nthe state to the ground, convinced that he’d be less likely to\nlose it again without them. And when the Bentivoglio family\nreturned to power in Bologna it did the same thing. So,\nwhether fortresses are useful or not will depend on the circum-\nstances; in one situation they’ll be a help and in another they’ll\nbe dangerous. We can sum up the reasons for this as follows.\nThe ruler who is more afraid of his people than of foreign\nenemies must build fortresses; but the ruler who is more\nafraid of foreign enemies should do without them. The castle\nFrancesco Sforza built in Milan has provoked and will go on\nprovoking more rebellions against the Sforza family than any\nother cause of unrest in the whole state. Your best fortress is\nnot to be hated by the people, because even if you do have\nfortresses, they won’t save you if the people hate you. Once\nthe people have decided to take up arms against you they’ll\nnever be short of foreign support. In recent times there are no\nexamples of fortresses having proved useful to any ruler at\nall, with the exception of the Countess of Forlı `, Caterina\nSforza, when her husband, Count Girolamo Riario, was mur-\ndered.

Since each of these came\nas a consequence of the one before, he never gave the more\npowerful men in the country any slack time between wars\nwhen they could plot against him.\nA leader can also win acclaim by giving impressive demon-\nstrations of character in his handling of domestic affairs, as\nBernabo` Visconti did in Milan; whenever anyone does any-\nthing remarkable, whether for good or ill, in civil life, you\nthink up some reward or punishment that will cause a stir.\nBut above all a ruler must make sure that everything he\ndoes gives people the impression that he is a great man of\nremarkable abilities.\nA ruler will also be respected when he is a genuine friend\nand a genuine enemy, that is, when he declares himself unam-\nbiguously for one side and against the other. This policy will\nalways bring better results than neutrality. For example, if\nyou have two powerful neighbours who go to war, you may\nor may not have reason to fear the winner afterwards. Either\nway it will always be better to take sides and ﬁght hard. If\nyou do have cause to fear but stay neutral, you’ll still be\ngobbled up by the winner to the amusement and satisfaction\nof the loser; you’ll have no excuses, no defence and nowhere\nto hide. Because a winner doesn’t want half-hearted friends\nwho don’t help him in a crisis; and the loser will have nothing\nto do with you since you didn’t choose to ﬁght alongside him\nand share his fate.\nWhen Antiochus was sent to Greece by the Aetolians to\npush back the Romans, he sent ambassadors to the Achaeans,\nwho were allied to the Romans, asking them to remain neu-\ntral, while for their part the Romans encouraged them to join\nthe war on their side. The Achaean council debated the matter\nand after Antiochus’s ambassador had spoken, asking them\nto remain neutral, the Roman ambassador replied: ‘With\nwhat a ruler should do to win respect 8 9\nregard to this invitation to remain neutral, nothing could be\nmore damaging to your interests: you’ll get no thanks, no\nconsideration and will be taken as a reward by whoever wins.’\nThe contender who is not your ally will always try to get\nyou to stay neutral and your ally will always try to get you to\nﬁght. Indecisive rulers who want to avoid immediate danger\nusually decide to stay neutral, and usually things end badly\nfor them. But if you declare yourself courageously for one\nside or the other and your ally wins, he’ll be indebted to you\nand there’ll be a bond of friendship between you, so that even\nif he is more powerful now and has you at his mercy he’s\nnot going to be so shameless as to take advantage of the\ncircumstances and become an example of ingratitude. Vic-\ntories are never so decisive that the winner can override every\nprinciple, justice in particular. But if your ally loses, you’re\nstill his friend and he’ll offer what help he can: you become\ncompanions in misfortune, and your luck could always turn.\nIn the event that the two neighbours going to war are not\nso powerful that you need fear the winner, it is even more\nsensible to take sides and get involved: you’ll be destroying\none with the help of another who, if he had any sense, would\nbe protecting the loser. And when your ally wins, which with\nyour help is inevitable, he’ll be at your mercy.\nHere it’s worth noting that a ruler must never ally himself\nwith someone more powerful in order to attack his enemies,\nunless, as I said above, it is absolutely necessary. Because\nwhen you win you’ll be at your ally’s mercy, and whenever\npossible rulers must avoid placing themselves in another’s\npower. The Venetians allied themselves with France to attack\nthe Duke of Milan. It was an alliance they could have avoided\nand it led to disaster. But when such an alliance can’t be\navoided, as was the case with Florence when the pope and\nSpain took their armies to attack Lombardy, then a ruler must\ntake sides for the reasons set out above. In general, a ruler\nmust never imagine that any decision he takes is safe; on the\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   88 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n8 8 the prince\nplanning and doing great things, keeping his people in a state\nof suspense and admiration, concentrated as they were on the\noutcome of his various campaigns.

But if your ally loses, you’re\nstill his friend and he’ll offer what help he can: you become\ncompanions in misfortune, and your luck could always turn.\nIn the event that the two neighbours going to war are not\nso powerful that you need fear the winner, it is even more\nsensible to take sides and get involved: you’ll be destroying\none with the help of another who, if he had any sense, would\nbe protecting the loser. And when your ally wins, which with\nyour help is inevitable, he’ll be at your mercy.\nHere it’s worth noting that a ruler must never ally himself\nwith someone more powerful in order to attack his enemies,\nunless, as I said above, it is absolutely necessary. Because\nwhen you win you’ll be at your ally’s mercy, and whenever\npossible rulers must avoid placing themselves in another’s\npower. The Venetians allied themselves with France to attack\nthe Duke of Milan. It was an alliance they could have avoided\nand it led to disaster. But when such an alliance can’t be\navoided, as was the case with Florence when the pope and\nSpain took their armies to attack Lombardy, then a ruler must\ntake sides for the reasons set out above. In general, a ruler\nmust never imagine that any decision he takes is safe; on the\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   89 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n9 0 the prince\ncontrary he should reckon that any decision is potentially\ndangerous. It is in the nature of things that every time you try\nto avoid one danger you run into another. Good sense consists\nin being able to assess the dangers and choose the lesser of\nvarious evils.\nA ruler must also show that he admires achievement in\nothers, giving work to men of ability and rewarding people\nwho excel in this or that craft. What’s more, he should\nreassure his subjects that they can go calmly about their\nbusiness as merchants or farmers, or whatever other trade\nthey practise, without worrying that if they increase their\nwealth they’ll be in danger of having it taken away from them,\nor that if they start up a business they’ll be punitively taxed.\nOn the contrary, a ruler should offer incentives to people who\nwant to do this kind of thing and to whoever plans to bring\nprosperity to his city or state. Then at the right times of the\nyear he should entertain people with shows and festivals. And\nsince every city is divided into guilds and districts, he should\nrespect these groups and go to their meetings from time to\ntime, showing what a humane and generous person he is,\nthough without ever forgetting the authority of his position,\nsomething he must always keep to the fore.\n22\nA ruler’s ministers\nA ruler’s choice of ministers is an important matter. The\nquality of the ministers will reﬂect his good sense or lack of\nit and give people their ﬁrst impression of the way the ruler’s\nmind is working. If his ministers are capable and loyal, people\nwill always reckon a ruler astute, because he was able to\nrecognize their ability and command their loyalty. When they\nare not, people will always have reason to criticize, because\nthe ﬁrst mistake the ruler made was in his choice of ministers.\nEveryone who knew Antonio da Venafro, Pandolfo Petrucci’s\nminister in Siena, thought Pandolfo extremely smart for\nhaving chosen him.\nThere are actually three kinds of mind: one kind grasps\nthings unaided, the second sees what another has grasped,\nthe third grasps nothing and sees nothing. The ﬁrst kind is\nextremely valuable, the second valuable, the third useless. So\nalthough Pandolfo didn’t have the ﬁrst kind of mind, he cer-\ntainly had the second; if someone is sharp enough to recognize\nwhat’s right and wrong in what another man says and does,\nthen even if he doesn’t have the creativity to make policy\nhimself, he can still see which of his minister’s policies are\npositive and negative, encourage the good ones and correct\nthe bad. The minister, meanwhile, will realize that he can’t\nfool the ruler and so will have to behave.\nThere is one infallible way of checking a minister’s creden-\ntials: when you see the man thinking more for himself than\n9780141442259_ThePrince_TXT.indd   90 28/05/2015   14:14\n\f\n9 0 the prince\ncontrary he should reckon that any decision is potentially\ndangerous.

To make sure he does\nso, the ruler, for his part, must take an interest in the minister,\ngrant him wealth and respect, oblige him and share honours\nand appointments with him.

However, the ruler should ask his\nministers about everything and listen to their opinions, then\nmake up his mind on his own, following his own criteria. In\nresponding to these advisers, as a group or separately, he\nshould make it clear that the more openly they speak, the\nmore welcome their advice will be.

People\nwatch what a new ruler does far more attentively than they\ndo a hereditary one and if his achievements are impressive\nthey’ll have a greater hold on people and command greater\nloyalty than an old royal bloodline. Men are more interested\nin the present than the past and when things are going well\nthey’ll be happy and won’t look elsewhere; on the contrary,\nthey’ll do everything they can to defend a ruler so long as he\ndoesn’t let himself down in other ways. So he’ll enjoy the\ndouble glory of having both founded a new kingdom and\ngraced and consolidated it with good laws, a good army, good\nallies and good policies. Conversely, the man who’s born to\npower but behaves so stupidly as to lose it is shamed twice\nover.\nTurning now to those Italian rulers who’ve lost power in\nrecent years – the King of Naples, for example, and the Duke\nof Milan and others too – the ﬁrst thing we ﬁnd is that they\nall had poor armies, this for the reasons I discussed at length\nabove. Then we see that some of them had the people against\nthem, or if they did have the people’s support they couldn’t\nkeep the nobles on their side.

This isn’t a bad policy when you have no\nalternative, but to trust in that reaction when you could have\ntaken other precautions is a serious failing; a ruler should\nnever be resigned to falling from power because he’s counting\non ﬁnding someone to prop him up again afterwards.

In 1498 he negotiated with Louis XII in Paris on behalf\nof his father; the king’s marriage was dissolved, allowing him to\nmarry the widow of Charles VIII, while Louis agreed to an\naggressive military alliance with the pope to capture Naples.\nCesare then became the ﬁrst person in history to resign his pos-\nition as cardinal, upon which Louis made him Duke of Valenti-\nnois, hence the nickname, Duke Valentino. The alliance with\nLouis was reinforced by Borgia’s marriage to Charlotte d’Albret,\nthe king’s cousin, and Borgia was serving with Louis’s army when\nit captured Milan in 1499. Prompted by his father and with\nLouis’s military support, Borgia set out to conquer the Romagna,\ntaking the towns of Fano, Pesaro, Rimini, Cesena, Forlı `, Faenza\nand Imola.
