of	that	type,	it’s	a	near	certainty	that
the	 cops	 are	 coaching	 them.	 And	 that	 makes	 kidnappers
very	nervous.
Even	 beyond	 the	 nerves,	 you	 had	 the	 problem	 that
answering	 questions	 like	 those	 required	 little,	 if	 any,	 effort.
The	 bad	 guys	 go	 and	 get	 the	 fact	 and	 give	 it	 to	 you	 right
away,	because	it’s	so	easy.	Bang,	bang,	bang!	It	happens	so
fast	 that	 you	 didn’t	gain	 any	 tactical	 advantage,	 any	 usableinformation,	 any	 effort	 on	 their	 part	 toward	 a	 goal	 that
serves	you.	And	 all	 negotiation,	 done	 well,	 should	 be	 an
information-gathering	process	that	vests	your	counterpart	in
an	outcome	that	serves	you.
Worst	of	all,	the	bad	guys	know	that	they	have	just	given
you	 something—a	 proof	 of	 life—which	 triggers	 this	 whole
human	reciprocity	gene.	Whether	we	like	to	recognize	it	or
not,	a	universal	rule	of	human	nature,	across	all	cultures,	is
that	when	 somebody	 gives	 you	 something,	 they	 expect
something	in	return.	And	they	won’t	give	anything	else	until
you	pay	them	back.
Now,	 we	 didn’t	 want	 to	 trigger	 this	 whole	 reciprocity
thing	 because	we	didn’t	want	 to	 give	 anything.	 So	 what
happened?	All	of	our	conversations	became	these	paralyzed
confrontations	 between	 two	 parties	 who	 wanted	 to	 extract
something	 from	 each	 other	 but	 didn’t	 want	 to	 give.	 We
didn’t	communicate,	out	of	pride	and	fear.
That’s	why	we	failed,	while	numbskulls	like	this	crooked
Philippine	 politician	 just	 stumbled	 in	 and	 got	 what	 we	 so
desperately	 needed.	 That	 is,	 communication	 without
reciprocity.	I	sat	back	and	wondered	to	myself,	How	the	hell
do	
we
	do	that?
SUSPEND	UNBELIEF
While	 I	 was	 racking	 my	 brains	 over	 how	 this	 sleazy
politician	 managed	 to	 get	 Martin	 Burnham	 on	 the	 phone
while	 we	 never	 could,	 FBI	 Pittsburgh	 had	 a	 kidnapping
case. /******/My	 partner	 Chuck	 brought	 me	 the	 tapes	 from	 the	 case
because	 he	 thought	 it	 was	 funny.	You	 see,	 one	 Pittsburgh
drug	 dealer	 had	 kidnapped	 the	 girlfriend	 of	 another	 drug
dealer,	 and	 was	 making	 a	 move	 to	 leave	 because	 he	 was
tired	of	waiting.
Just	 then	 a	 senior	 physician	 arrived.	 After	 calmly
offering	the	patient	a	glass	of	water	and	asking	if	they	could
chat	for	a	minute,	he	said	he	understood	why	the	patient	was
pissed	off	and	promised	to	call	the	lab	to	see	why	the	results
were	delayed.
But	 what	 he	 did	 next	 is	 what	 really	 suspended	 the
patient’s	 unbelief:	 he	 asked	 a	 calibrated	 question—what	 he
felt	 was	 so	 important	 about	 leaving—and	 then	 when	 the
patient	 said	 he	 had	 errands	 to	 handle,	 the	 doctor	 offered	 to
connect	the	 patient	with	services	that	 could	 help	 him	 get
them	done.	And,	boom,	the	patient	volunteered	to	stay.
What’s	 so	 powerful	 about	 the	 senior	 doctor’s	 technique
is	that	he	took	what	was	a	showdown—“I’m	going	to	leave”
versus	“You	can’t	leave”—and	asked	questions	that	led	the
patient	to	solve	his	own	problem	.	.	.	in	the	way	the	doctor
apped.	It	was	still	a	kind	of	showdown,	of	course,	but	the	doctor
took	 the	confrontation	 and	 bravado	 out	 of	 it	 by	 giving	 the
patient	 the	 illusion	 of	 control.	 As	 an	 old	
Washington	 Post
editor	 named	 Robert	 Estabrook	
once	 said,	 “He	 who	 has
learned	to	disagree	without	being	disagreeable	has
discovered	the	most	valuable	secret	of	negotiation.”
This	 same	 technique	 for	 suspending	 unbelief	 that	 you
use	with	kidnappers	and	 escaping	 patients	 works	 for
anything,	even	negotiating	prices.	When	you	go	into	a	store,
instead	 of	telling	 the	salesclerk	what	 you	 “need,”	 you	 can
describe	what	you’re	looking	for	and	ask	for	suggestions.
Then,	once	you’ve	picked	out	what	you	want,	instead	of
hitting	them	with	a	hard	offer,	you	can	just	say	the	price	is	a
bit	more	than	you	budgeted	and	ask	for	help	with	one	of	the
greatest-of-all-time	 calibrated	 questions:	 “How	 am	 I
supposed	to	 do	 that?”	The	 critical	 part	 of	 this	 approach	 is
that	 you	 really	 are	 asking	 for	 help	 and	 your	 delivery	 must
convey	 that.	 With	 this	 negotiating	 scheme,	 instead	 of
bullying
