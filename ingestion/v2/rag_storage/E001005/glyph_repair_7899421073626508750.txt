like that, it's often seen as a sign of weakness. You don't want to be giving away information about your hostages unless you absolutely have to. And the kidnappers know this. So they're often reluctant to give you proof of life. They may just tell you what they think you want to hear, which could lead you down the wrong path.

The other problem is that these questions are not very effective at proving that a hostage is alive. If a kidnapper really wants to mislead you, it's relatively easy for them to come up with an answer. It's also pretty easy to fake a recording of someone giving an answer to one of these questions.

So why do we use them? Well, there are a few reasons. One is that they provide a kind of psychological comfort. When you're dealing with hostage situations, every piece of information counts. If you can get the kidnapper to give you some information about your hostage, it's like getting a small victory. It gives you hope and helps keep you going.

Another reason is that they can sometimes be a useful tool for negotiating. If you can get the kidnapper to agree to answer one of these questions, it might be a sign that they are starting to trust you. And if they trust you, they might be more likely to agree to other things.

But overall, I think we need to find new ways to communicate with our counterparts in these situations. We can't keep relying on the same old tactics that haven't worked for years. We need to be creative and try new things if we want to save lives.
