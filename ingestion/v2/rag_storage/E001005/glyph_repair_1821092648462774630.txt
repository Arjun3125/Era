CE, but it's not simple intuition or mathematics either. To bargain well, you need to shed your assumptions about the haggling process and learn to recognize the subtle psychological strategies that play vital roles at the bargaining table. Skilled bargainers see more than just opening offers, counteroffers, and closing moves. They see the psychological currents that run below the surface.

Once you've learned to identify these currents, you'll be able to "read" bargaining situations more accurately and confidently answer the tactical questions that dog even the best negotiators. You'll be ready for the "bare-knuckle bargaining." And they'll never see it coming.

A few years ago, I was on my boat with one of my employees, a great guy named Keenon; I was supposed to be giving him a pep talk and performance review. "When I think of what we do, I describe it as 'uncovering the riptide,'" I said.

"Uncovering the riptide," Keenon said.

"Yes, the idea is that we—you and I and everyone here —have the skills to identify the psychological forces that are pulling us away from shore and use them to get somewhere more productive."

"Somewhere more productive," Keenon said.

"Exactly," I said. "To a place where we can . . ."

We had talked for about forty-five minutes when my son Brandon, who runs operations for The Black Swan Group, broke out laughing.

"I can't take it anymore! Don't you see? Really, Dad, don't you see?"

I blinked. Did I see what? I asked him.

"All Keenon is doing is mirroring you. And he's been doing it for almost an hour."

"Oh," I said, my face going red as Keenon began to laugh. He was totally right. Keenon had been playing with me the entire time, using the psychological tool that works most effectively with assertive guys like me: the mirror.
