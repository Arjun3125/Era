"Brandon was a ball carrier on his team, but he had difficulty avoiding blockers. His coach pleaded with him to change his behavior, but Brandon couldn’t do it. He loved hitting opposing players and saw flattening them as a source of pride. Both his coach and I tried to explain the situation to him, but we always received the worst possible answer - "You're right."

Whenever someone is bothering you and they won't stop, and they don't want to listen to anything you have to say, what do you tell them to get them to shut up and go away? "You're right." It works every time. Tell people "you're right" and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least twenty-four hours. But you haven't agreed to their position. You have used "you're right" to get them to quit bothering you.

I was in the same situation with Brandon. He didn't hear me and embrace my request. What could I say to get through to this kid? How could I reach Brandon and help him change course?

I thought back to Benjie and Sabaya. I took Brandon aside before a crucial game. I had searched my mind for a way to hear the two critical words, "That's right."

"You seem to think it's unmanly to dodge a block," I told him. "You think it's cowardly to get out of someone's way that's trying to hit you."

Brandon stared at me and paused.

"That's right," he said. With those words, Brandon embraced the reality of what was holding him back. Once he understood why he was trying to knock down every blocker, he changed course. He started avoiding the blocks and became an exceptionally fine linebacker."
