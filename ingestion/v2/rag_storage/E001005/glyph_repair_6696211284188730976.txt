wasn't what his coach or I had in mind for him.
Every time Brandon played this way, it was a disaster. The opposing team knew exactly where he was on the field because of his aggressive approach. They would set up blockers to keep Brandon from getting to the ball. It was frustrating to watch because we could see what Brandon was trying to do, but the other team wouldn't budge.
Brandon wasn't hearing "that's right." He was only hearing "you're wrong" over and over again. This was a significant issue in our negotiations. We wanted to hear "that's right," but we weren't getting it because we were too focused on proving ourselves correct, rather than understanding the other side and allowing them to be correct as well.
The key is not just trying to convince the other person that you are right; instead, we need to get them to see things our way by acknowledging their version of events without giving in.
To do this, we can use techniques like active listening, mirroring, encouragers, labeling, and paraphrasing. These tactics helped us break through the deadlock with Sabaya and lead to a successful outcome for Jeffrey Schilling.
However, even if you are correct in your negotiations or arguments, it won't matter if the other person doesn't agree with you. You need them on board and willing to work together towards a common goal.
It's important not only to convince others that "you're right," but also to let them know "that's right." It may seem counterintuitive, but acknowledging the other person's perspective can actually help you achieve your desired outcome.
